Each Fund is an open-end management investment company registered underthe 1940 Act. CKW, a registered broker-dealer, serves or is expected toserve as the distributor of the shares of each Fund. PBCM, a registeredinvestment adviser, serves as investment adviser of each Fund.2. Shares of the No-Load Fund are sold at their relative net asset valuewithout a sales charge. Shares of each of the Load Funds are offered attheir relative net asset value, plus a maximum sales load of 4.75% of thepublic offering price per share, except for shares of the Southern MasterTrust which are offered with a maximum sales load of 4.50% of the publicoffering price per share. As set forth in the prospectuses of the LoadFunds, all sales charges are subject to reduction depending on the sizeof the investment.3. Applicants seek the flexibility to allow shareholders of any No-LoadFund or any Load Fund to exchange all or a portion of their shares (includingshares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and capital gainsdistributions) for shares of certain other Funds for which the Distributorserves as principal underwriter as specified herein. Any sales load chargedwith respect to an acquired security will be a percentage that is no greaterthan the excess, if any, of the rate of the sales load applicable to thatsecurity in the absence of an exchange over the total rate of any salesload previously paid on the exchanged security. No redemption fee willbe imposed with respect to the exchanged security.4. Applicants seek the ability to permit the following exchange offersbetween Funds: (i) Shares of a Load Fund may be exchanged for shares ofanother Load Fund on the basis of relative net asset value without thepayment of a sales load, except that if the sales load applicable to theshares of the Load Fund being acquired in the exchange exceeds the maximumsales load that could have been imposed in connection with the purchaseof the shares being surrendered in the exchange (at the time such shareswere acquired), without giving effect to any applicable reduction in salesloads, the difference will be deducted as an additional sales load andwill be paid to the Distributor; (ii) shares of a No-Load Fund may be exchangedfor shares of another No-Load Fund on the basis of relative net asset valuewithout the payment of a sales load; (iii) shares of a Load Fund may beexchanged for shares of a No-Load Fund on the basis of relative net assetvalue without the payment of a sales load; and (iv) shares of a No-LoadFund may be exchanged for shares of any Load Fund subject to the salesload normally charged by the Load Fund (unless the investment in thoseshares was previously subject to a sales load by one of the Load Fundsor was acquired by dividend or distribution reinvestment in a Load Fund).5. In the event that a sales charge is imposed on an exchange, any rightof accumulation as described in the Fund's prospectus would be consideredin determining the sales charge applicable to the exchange. If a shareholderhas executed a Letter of Intent whereby he immediately qualifies for areduced sales charge upon the purchase of shares of a Load Fund and effectsan exchange prior to completing the Letter of Intent, his account willbe charged an appropriate sales charge prior to the exchange, taking intoaccount the terms and conditions of any Letter of Intent then in effect.Also, each exchange will be subject to the minimum investment requirementsof the particular Fund's shares that are to be acquired in the exchange.6. Any shares exchanged that were acquired through reinvestment of dividendsand capital gain distributions will be deemed to have been sold with asales load, if any, equal to the sales load, if any, previously paid onthe shares on which the dividend was paid or distribution made. Moreover,where a shareholder exchanges less than all of his shares of a particularFund, the shares upon which the highest sales load was previously paidwill be deemed to be exchanged first.7. Funds reserve the right to impose a nominal administrative fee (in anamount not exceeding $5.00 per exchange or such greater amount as the SECor its staff may permit), applied uniformly to all shareholders. The amountof any administrative fee imposed on an exchange will be disclosed in eachFund's prospectus and any sales literature that mentions the existenceof the exchange privilege. Also, the existence of the administrative feewill be disclosed in any advertising that mentions the existence of theexchange privilege.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Analysis </ITAG>1. Applicants submit that the exemption requested is appropriate and inthe public interest, and is consistent with the policies underlying theprovisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants submit that the purpose of the proposedexchange privilege between Funds is (i) to remove any ambiguity concerningApplicant's ability to offer or exchange Fund shares in the manner describedabove, and (ii) to permit a shareholder of any Fund in the ABT family offunds (all funds for which PBCM serves as adviser) to exchange, in a simpletransaction, his Fund shares for shares of any other Fund on a fair andequitable basis when market, tax considerations or changes in the shareholder'sinvestment objectives warrant such an exchange. Such exchange privilegewill facilitate an investor's desire to hold shares of a particular Fundthat offers objectives and policies best suited to his current goals withoutdelay or unnecessary expense. 2. Applicants submit that if exchanges between Funds were always made attheir relative net asset values, the distribution system of the Load Fundswould be disrupted because an investor could easily avoid the sales chargeby acquiring No-Load Fund shares and immediately exchanging the sharesso acquired for Load Fund shares. The offers of exchange proposed by theApplicants would avoid this problem, would be equitable to all shareholdersand would benefit exchanging shareholders by crediting them for sales chargespreviously paid. CKW has established sufficient internal review proceduresto ensure that exchanges are made at the request of investors and not forthe brokers' personal gain and that it is actively monitoring customercomplaints and will continue to be alert to the possible abuses that mightoccur regarding the exchange privilege. 3. Applicants submit that the proposed exchanges would be consistent withproposed Rule 11a-3 under the 1940 Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions </ITAG>If the requested order is granted, the Applicants agree to the followingconditions: 1.

Shareholders of each Fund will be notified of the Fund's exchange programby means of the particular Fund's prospectus and in other communications,including sales literature or advertising. 5. Shareholders of each Fund will be notified by means of the particularFund's prospectus and in sales literature and advertising that discussesthe exchange privilege of the fact that the Fund reserves the right tomodify or terminate its exchange privilege. 6. Shareholders will be notified in writing at least 60 days prior to anymodification or termination of a particular Fund's exchange privilege,except in the case of a reduction or elimination or any administrativefee or sales load in which case notice shall not be required; provided,however, that the temporary cessation of the sale of Fund shares underextraordinary circumstances such as when the Fund is unable to invest effectivelyamounts in accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies andrestrictions, or the suspension of the redemption of Fund shares pursuantto section 22(e) of the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereundershall not be considered a modification or termination of the particularFund's exchange privilege. 7.
