Helene, packing sustained winds of 85 mph, is the firsthurricane to form since Gilbert went on a rampage last week throughthe Caribbean, Mexico and the Texas Gulf Coast.   At 6 a.m. EDT, the center of Helene was located near latitude12.1 north, longitude 39.3 west, or about 1,450 miles east of theLesser Antilles, a group of islands southeast of Puerto Rico,according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center.   The storm, which registered 75 mph when it became a hurricaneearly today, was moving west at 15 mph and maintain that course forthe next day or two with a good chance for further strengthening,the advisory said.   ``Conditions are quite favorable for it to pick up strength.There's nothing to stop it way out there in the middle of theocean,'' said Stanley Wright, a meteorologist at the hurricanecenter. ``But it's still way too early to tell if it will get asbig as Gilbert.''   Meteorologist Randy Lascody said the path of Helene, the eighthnamed storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, cannot be projecteduntil it moves closer to the Caribbean.   ``It's going across the warmest water of the year now, which isperfect to fuel its growth,'' Lascody said. ``But it really wouldbe very premature to give a guess on what may happen. It still hasa long way to go.''   Storms that form this month near the Cape Verde Islands offAfrica's coast are often the season's strongest because of idealhurricane-spawning conditions, forecasters say.   Factors such as low-pressure zones in the Caribbean andhigh-level winds will affect the storm's path, said Lascody.   ``It looks like it will reach its make-or-break point sometimelater this week,'' he said.   The depression that became Helene seemed disorganized when itformed two days ago, but satellite photos showed circulationimproved.   It will take about four days for Helene to get close enough tothe Caribbean to allow an Air Force reconnaissance plane to flyover it. Until then, hurricane forecasters will have to rely onsatellite reports, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when sustained windsreach 74 mph. In addition to Gilbert, which had top winds of 175mph, two other much smaller hurricanes formed this season: Debbie,which brushed the Mexican coast, and Florence, which moved overLouisiana.   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November,with September traditionally the most active month.</TEXT></DOC>
