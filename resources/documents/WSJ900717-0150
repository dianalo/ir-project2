Joining the National Guard while still in high school, helater slogged through four years of drills andmilitary-science classes here at the University of Kansas.Even a serious knee injury didn't quench the stocky historybuff's passion to win the gold bars of a second lieutenant.</LP><TEXT>   But Greg Sherman's martial dreams are now dead, one of theearliest victims of budget cuts hitting the Pentagon. Likemany other students enrolled in the Reserve Officers'Training Corps nationwide, he's learned that today'sshrinking Army has no room for him -- at least not as afull-time, active-duty officer. Nudged by his commandingofficer, he dropped out of the program this spring. He evenstayed away from the ROTC's graduation ceremonies a few weeksago to avoid the pain of watching 20 beaming classmates pinon those beloved bars.   &quot;I still know, deep inside, that I'm good enough to be acareer officer,&quot; Mr. Sherman says ruefully. &quot;If the Army wasflourishing, the way it was years ago under Reagan, Idefinitely would have stuck it out. But the whole world haschanged.&quot;   Among the first places in U.S. society to really feel theimpact of the defense-budget cuts now taking shape arecollege campuses. It's an ironic turnabout from Vietnam Wardays, when ROTC instructors were reviled at many schools asthe ugly face of the military-industrial complex.   Now Uncle Sam is telling undergraduates he doesn't wantthem. &quot;Young people are graduating, but we can't bring themon active duty because {the force} is getting smaller,&quot; Gen.Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,complained in a speech last month. &quot;I'm getting lots ofletters from parents who are disturbed by that.&quot;   Each of the armed services will need thousands fewerofficers in coming years, and the ROTC historically hasprovided about two-thirds of those leaders. The Army facesthe deepest manpower cuts, and in just the past few months ithas quietly forced out about 900 active-duty colonels andlieutenants.   But the easiest way to slim is to reduce intake, so amongthe most prominent targets of the cutbacks are the 86,000students enrolled at more than 1,000 American colleges anduniversities. &quot;This is a gut-wrenching process,&quot; concedesMaj. Gen. Wallace Arnold, who runs the Army's cadet-trainingcommand.   While the overall dimensions of the officer-training cutsstill aren't clear, the number of new Army ROTC graduatesassigned to active duty has dropped 25% from last year.Shunning the less-valued, part-time reserve assignments,about 1,000 would-be officers bailed out of Army ROTCprograms altogether in recent months. Many more are likely tobe encouraged to leave or be forced out in coming years asstandards get tougher, scholarship money dries up and ROTCinstruction is available at fewer schools.   &quot;We simply don't have enough money to train all thecurrent cadets,&quot; says Col. Robert Kuhn, the ruddy, talkativemilitary-science professor who has been running the Army ROTCprogram here at the University of Kansas, a pleasant campusof high-rise offices and ivy-covered classrooms nestled inrolling farmland. Already, he says, &quot;Students are asking whenwe're going to start kicking them out.&quot;   Ironically, all the post-Cold War changes haven't promptedthe Army's bureaucracy to issue formal orders to scale backROTC recruitment. So, while Col. Kuhn and his counterpartsstruggle to push older cadets out of the program, the ROTCinstructors continue to be judged by how many new cadets theysign up.   Col. Kuhn's second-floor window offers a good view of thespot where some of the Midwest's angriest demonstrationsagainst the Vietnam War took place. These days, students hereand at dozens of other campuses are protesting the DefenseDepartment's ban against gay men and women. The outcry beganafter three openly gay cadets from Harvard, MIT andWashington University in St. Louis were dismissed from theROTC or denied commissions. Since then, various schooladministrators have debated taking action against the ROTC.The Army, which last Friday announced it plans to phase outROTC units at 50 campuses across the country by the fall of1991, says the schools were chosen because they turn out thefewest officers and not because of any involvement with theprotests.   Col. Kuhn, meanwhile, has been assigned to begin teachingthis fall at West Point, which, along with the other serviceacademies that traditionally turn out many of the military'scareer officers, is expected to escape the brunt of thecutbacks. But ROTC cadets don't enjoy the same powerfulprotectors at the Pentagon.   Douglas Baskett, a mechanical-engineering major andself-described &quot;military fanatic,&quot; resigned from the ROTC,with some faculty encouragement, just weeks before graduationhere. Some of Mr. Baskett's friends are now officers; but allhe has to show in the way of military achievement for hiscountless mornings of marching, four years of studyingmilitary strategy and a rigorous six-week summer camp is apiece of paper certifying that he has successfully completed&quot;Army Military Qualification Standards Level I.&quot; Angrily, hesays: &quot;Nobody should go through four years of such hard workto be weeded out at the very end.&quot;   Paul Rocuant, a recent graduate of the University ofConnecticut, didn't wait to be pushed. Realizing that hewouldn't get his first choice of an assignment in militaryintelligence, the political-science major turned his back onthe military and enrolled in law school. &quot;The entire Army issurrounded by a cloud of uncertainty these days,&quot; Mr. Rocuantexplains.   Just to increase his chances of snaring an active-dutyassignment, Dane Childs, an athletic, gung-ho type at KansasState University, changed his major to history fromarchitecture. The gambit didn't work. Mr. Childs doesn'tdiscourage students from joining the Army ROTC, but says,&quot;It's an awful lot of sweat and effort for a crapshoot.&quot;   Even high-flying students are getting nervous. Here at theUniversity of Kansas, Jerry Rutherford, a pre-med studentwith nearly straight A's, wakes at 5:30 a.m. almost every dayduring the school year for extra training climbing ropes,throwing grenades and speed-assembling M-16 rifles. Yet Mr.Rutherford still worries about how cutbacks will affect hisfuture.   &quot;Above all, my father urged me to be a realist,&quot; says the20-year-old, whose grandfather was an Army general, and whosefather now holds the same rank commanding armored forces innorthern Germany. &quot;He stressed how hard it's going to be, howwell you will have to perform to go active duty.&quot;   The stakes for ROTC cadets are higher these days -- andmistakes more costly. Before graduating from NorthernMichigan University, Steven Bowman found out that the Armyrejected not only his bid to become an engineeringspecialist, but also his hope of joining the active-dutyforce. &quot;I felt cheated on both ends,&quot; he recalls, and hastilysigned papers to quit the ROTC. But now the former cadet isback in the Army reserves, still hoping to win a commission.&quot;For so many years, I fantasized about becoming an officer,&quot;Mr. Bowman explains. &quot;A single month away from ROTC made merealize how much I missed all the people and everythingconnected with it.&quot;   ---                Uncle Sam Doesn't Need You                                                                                                          FISCAL             TOTAL ARMY ROTC           ACTIVE-DUTY   YEAR               COMMISSIONS               ASSIGNMENTS                                                                                                          1989                  8,217                    4,428   1990                  8,225                    3,346   1991 (Projected)      6,000                    3,000                                                                                                          Source: U.S. Army</TEXT></DOC>
