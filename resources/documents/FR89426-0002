Box 80038, Wilmington, DE 19880-0038, had submitted pesticidepetition (PP) 9F3732 proposing to establish a tolerance in or on the RACpears at 0.3 ppm for the combined residues of the acaricide hexythiazox,trans-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-2-oxothiazolidine-3-carboxamideand its metabolites containing the (4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-2-oxo-3-thiazolidinemoiety (expressed as ppm of the parent compound).No comments were received in response to the notice of filing.The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance includea 12-month feeding study in dogs with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL)of 100 ppm (2.5 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day); a 24-month rat feeding/oncogenicitystudy with dietary levels of 0, 60, 430, and 3,000 ppm with a systemicNOEL of 430 ppm (21.5 mg/kg/day) with no evidence of oncogenicity at 3,000ppm, which was the highest dose tested (HDT); a 24-month mouse feeding/oncogenicitystudy with dietary levels of 0, 40, 250, and 1,500 ppm with a systemicNOEL of 250 ppm (37.5 mg/kg/day) in which there were significant increasesin liver carcinomas and adenoma/carcinoma in high-dose females at 1,500ppm (225 mg/kg/day) HDT; a two-generation rat reproduction study with amaternal toxicity NOEL of 400 ppm (20 mg/kg/day) and reproduction toxicityNOEL greater than 2,400 ppm (120 mg/kg/day) HDT; a rat teratology studywith maternal and developmental toxicity NOELs of 240 mg/kg/day; and arabbit teratology study with a maternal and developmental toxicity NOELgreater than 1,080 mg/kg/day (HDT). All of the genotoxicity studies submittedwere negative, including a reverse mutation (Ames) assay in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium; </T3>a chromosome aberration study with Chinesehamster ovary (CHO) cells; an unscheduled DNA synthesis study with rathepatocytes; and a forward mutation study involving the thymidine kinase(TK) locus in mouse lymphoma cells.The Agency has classified hexythiazox as a Class C (possible human) oncogenbased on a significantly increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas(p=0.028), and adenomas/carcinomas combined (p=0.024) in female mice atthe HDT (1,500 ppm) when compared to the controls as well as a significantlyincreased (pandless;0.001) incidence of preneo-plastic hepatic nodules inboth males and females at the highest dose tested (1,500 ppm).The decision supporting a Category C classification (rather than a CategoryB classification) was based primarily on the fact that only one specieswas affected (mouse), mutagenicity assays did not support upgrading toa B classification, and the structure-activity relationship of hexythiazoxto other compounds supported a C classification. In classifying hexythiazoxas a Category C oncogen, the Agency concluded that a quantitative estimationof the oncogenic potential for humans should be calculated because of theincreased incidence of malignant and combined benign/malignant liver tumorsin the female mouse. Thus, a Q\1\* of 3.9X10^2 (mg/kg/day)^1 in human equivalentshas been calculated.A full review of the data indicates that although hexythiazox is an oncogenin mice, the risks would be extremely small from the proposed use on pears.Estimated dietary oncogenic risk to the general population based on thehighly conservative assumption that all pears are treated with hexythiazoxand would bear residues at the proposed tolerance level is estimated tobe 10^6. The Agency believes that actual exposure and risk would be lower.The basis for this is that the risk of 10^6 reflects a worst-case dietaryexposure because it assumes that 100 percent of the United States pearcrop is treated with hexythiazox and that all quantities of the food consumedwill bear residue levels as high as the proposed tolerance. In reality,the Agency knows that all pears would not be treated with this pesticide.Based upon an analysis of the market penetration of currently registeredacaricides, the Agency expects the percent of crop treated with hexythiazoxin a typical year would be about 30 percent. Likewise, the Agency believesthat residue levels in pear juice and nectar will not exceed the establishedtolerance of 0.30 ppm in or on the RAC pears. The maximum residue levelin pear juice would be expected to be less than 50 percent of the residuelevel in whole fruit. In addition, since there are no animal feed itemsinvolved with pears and the petitioner has included the label restriction``Do not graze or feed livestock or cover crops growing in treated areas,''no secondary residues in meat or milk are expected.Based on an assessment of the risks of the proposed use of hexythiazox,the Agency believes that the proposed use of hexythiazox on pears willpose an extremely small risk to humans and that the proposed tolerancelevel is acceptable and should be established.The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on a NOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day froma 1-year dog feeding study and a safety factor of 100 is 0.025 mg/kg bodyweight/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution from the proposedtolerance is 0.000037 mg/kg body weight/day. This is equivalent to about7.4 percent of the ADI.The metabolism of the chemical in plants for this use on pears is adequatelyunderstood. An analytical method (gas liquid chromatography with an electroncapture detector) is available for enforcement. Prior to its publicationin the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual</T3>, Vol. II, the enforcement methodologyis being made available in the interim to anyone who is interested in pesticideenforcement when requested from: By mail: Information Service Section (H-7504C),Program Management and Support Division, Office of Pesticide Programs,Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.Office location and telephone number: Room 200, CM andplusmin;2, 1921 JeffersonDavis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-3262.The tolerance established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 is adequate to coverresidues in or on pears.There are currently no actions pending against the registration of thisproduct. This pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for whichthe tolerance is sought.Based on the above information and data considered, the Agency concludesthat the tolerance would protect the public health. Therefore, the toleranceis established as set forth below.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> file written objections with the Hearing Clerk(address above). Such objections should be submitted in quintuplicate andspecify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the groundsfor the objections. If a hearing is requested, the objections must statethe issues for the hearing. A hearing will be granted if the objectionsare legally sufficient to justify the relief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601-612)), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from the tolerance requirements do not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A certification statement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="20">(Sec. 408(c), 72 Stat. 1786 (21 U.S.C. 346(c)))</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
