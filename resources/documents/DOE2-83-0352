The hedonic wage function is fitted to a sample of 481 railroadindustry employees for the same year. The efficient level of 1980 disablinginjuries for each railroad is determined by setting the marginal cost(MC) of injury reduction equal to its marginal benefit (MB). In addition,the cost savings accruing to efficient regulatory reform are calculatedfor each firm as well as the entire industry. A second-best cost-minimizingregulatory policy is also introduced. The cost-minimizing level of injuriesand resulting cost savings for individual firms and the total industryare estimated. The results support the prior hypothesis that MC exceedsMB for the vast majority of firms. Substantial cost savings are possibleunder reformed regulatory policy.</TEXT></DOC>
