ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Forest Service officials asked Congress onThursday for ``hot pursuit'' authority against marijuana growers innational forests whose illicit crops are protected by powerfulweapons and snarling guard dogs that respond to commands sentthrough radio-equipped collars.   William L. Rice, deputy chief of the Agriculture Departmentagency that oversees 191 million acres of national forests andgrasslands, said his law enforcement agents are severely hamperedby a legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana growers beyondthe boundaries of federal lands.   Frank G. Packwood, a Forest Service special agent assigned toShasta-Trinity National Forest in northern California, blamed thelack of ``hot pursuit'' for the poor success rate in prosecutinggrowers who cultivate the potent variety of marijuana known as``California gold'' in his region.   The request for statutory authority to pursue those engaged inwhat Rice called ``a major billion-dollar criminal industry'' innational forests was endorsed by Sens. Tom Harkins, D-Iowa, andWyche Fowler, D-Ga., at a Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearing.   ``These marijuana gardens are protected by a Marquis de Sadetorture chamber of devices intended to main, cripple or killintruders,'' Fowler said. ``Hunters and hikers have been injured inthese booby traps.''   Rice said heavily armed marijuana growers forced the ForestService to close 886,000 acres of national forest lands last yearas unsafe for visitors, commercial interests and federal employees.   The witness table at the hearing was littered with samples ofweapons used by marijuana growers to keep intruders away.   Among them were a Uzi submachine gun, hand grenades, makeshiftshotguns attached to rat traps and trip wires, boards studded withheavy nails and triple fish hooks designed to be strung at eyelevel from tree branches.   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., testified that during one raid on amethamphetamine laboratory near a national forest in southernOregon, the county sheriff ``seized a cache of weapons that couldoutfit a small army.''   He said they included 51 machine guns, semi-automatic rifles,anti-aircraft guns and other automatic weapons, 100,000 rounds ofammunition and 150 pounds of gunpowder.   Forest Service officials said the growers also set out poisonedfeed to kill wildlife that eat marijuana plants, and sabotage theequipment of timber workers and other commercial operators.   The growers train guard dogs to respond to commands to attackintruders when an electrical shock is activated in their collars bya remote radio signal, the hearing was told.   ``These people mean business,'' Wyden said.   ``These are modern-day moonshiners,'' Harkin said, ``but theyare a lot more sophisticated than the old moonshiners.''   Rice said the Forest Service eradicated more than 250,000marijuana plants from 220 cultivation sites last year, about 40percent of all the marijuana being produced in national forests.   But agent Packwood said eradication efforts are not enough.``The solution lies in increased arrests, thorough investigations,aggressive prosecutions and sentences that clearly establish adeterrent to the temptation to spend six months and `earn' half amillion dollars tax-free,'' he said.   Wyden, declaring that the $14 billion domestic marijuanaindustry is ``threatening the quality of life all over the West,''urged support for his bill to grant Forest Service agents toconduct investigations, searches, seizures and arrests outsidenational forests where drug crimes occur.   He also proposed to strengthen federal penalties forunauthorized use of fertilizers and chemical herbicides in nationalforests, and to stiffen the maximum penalties for marijuanacultivation on those lands.   Forest Service officials said the maximum federal penalty forusing booby traps or other weapons at illicit marijuana farms nowis 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Additional penalties formarijuana cultivation depend on the amounts involved, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
