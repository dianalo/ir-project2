Of particular concern are sites with low-frequency surfacewaves, those below 5 Hz. These vibrations can produce excessive structuralresponse and strains in nearby buildings. A Bureau of Mines, U.S. Departmentof the Interior, study of one such site found the ground acting as thepropagating medium primarily responsible for generating and sustainingthese low-frequency waves. The observed waves were consistent with predictivemodels based on layer thicknesses equal to the depths to abandoned undergroundmines known to exist in the area. A thick zone of low-velocity glacialtill also exists between the blast and the affected homes. Because someinfluence was also found from the initiation delay timing, blast designsbased no specific timing patterns could be used to reduce the generatedvibrations at such sites.</TEXT></DOC>
