GIVEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn, whose$60-per-share bid for Texaco Inc. has met a heavy dose ofskepticism on Wall Street, says he will have little problem raisingthe necesary cash to finance the buyout.   Meeting with securities analysts Thursday, Icahn said he wouldhave to borrow $8.86 billion to complete his offer, made last week,to buy the 86.2 percent of the company's stock he does not alreadyown for $12.4 billion. The bid put a total value on Texaco's 207million shares of $14.6 billion.   To complete the deal, Icahn said he would sell two subsidiaries_ Texaco Canada Inc. and the company's 50 percent interest inCaltex, among other provisions.   He then would borrow against the $2.98 billion cash flowexpected to be generated this year to obtain the remainder, Icahnsaid.   Texaco later scoffed at the plan, calling Icahn's offer ``stillillusory'' and dismissing the details he provided as ``sketchy,sloppy and wrong.''   Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, launched a proxy fight forfive of the company's 14 board seats on Friday, after the boardrejected his offer.   He said he would have dropped the bid if Texaco had put it to ashareholder vote at the company's annual meeting later this month.   If his five-man slate wins, Icahn said Thursday he is confidenthe would be able to persuade the board to sanction such a vote.   As far as financing is concerned, ``We've had several banks tellus we would have no trouble raising that on the basis that (thetakeover would be) on a friendly basis,'' Icahn said.   On hostile terms, however, ``it would be just about impossible''because of certain statutory requirements, he added.   Texaco said in a statement issued from its White Plains, N.Y.,headquarters that Icahn's $8.86 billion figure ``simply wished awayor ignored more than $5 billion in debt and other obligations hewould also have to immediately finance.   ``Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., our financial advisor, has informedTexaco that Icahn's plan is simply not financable in theiropinion,'' the statement added.   Securities analysts and the stock market have dimissed the offeras a ploy, either to lure other bidders into the ring, or toencourage Texaco's management to buy his shares or help him sellthem to a third party.   On the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco stock has traded justabove $50 a share _ far below the $60 Icahn proposed. In nationwidetrading Thursday, it closed at $50.62{ a share, down $1.75.   Icahn acknowledged that his own $60-per-share price was``cheap,'' saying: ``If it were out for a vote, there's no doubt inmy mind it would go higher, because there would be an auction.''   Asked what price he believed would be fair, Icahn replied: ``I'mnot going to go into that.''   From the start, Texaco officials questioned whether Icahn couldarrange financing for the deal, despite his pledge to put up $100million that would be forfeited to the company if he failed to comeup with the financing in time for Texaco's annual meeting June 17in Tulsa, Okla.   Icahn stipulated, however, that the $100 million would not beforfeited if another party topped his offer or if the InternalRevenue Service failed to assent to the plan.   On Thursday, he said his message to shareholders was simple:``Even if you don't like me, if you vote for me, I'm going to getyou $60.'' And, he added, ``If I can't get you your $60, I'llresign and (Texaco) will get its $100 million.''   If his slate loses, Icahn said he would ``go away,'' and sellhis shares ``in a secondary offer of some such thing.''   On another matter, Icahn also declined to comment on theinterest in Texaco of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., an investmentbanking firm with a long record for conducting takeovers.   In March Kohlberg said it bought 4.9 percent of Texaco's stockand asked permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission toup that stake to 15 percent.   Icahn told reporters that he had spoken to Henry Kravis butstressed they were not collaborating.   ``But that's not to say we have any deals with Henry Kravis, andwe don't. We absolutely don't,'' he added.   Icahn paid about $1.2 billion in building his Texaco stake,which is now worth about $1.8 billion.   The amount he already has paid and the $12.4 billion he isoffering for the remaining Texaco shares would put his total costfor acquiring the company at $13.6 billion _ the biggest sum everpaid in a corporate buyout.   The biggest deal so far was the $13.4 billion acquisition ofGulf Corp. by Standard Oil Co. of California, now Chevron Corp., in1984.</TEXT></DOC>
