The deputy transportation secretary, who spoke no English whenshe came to America as a third-grader in 1961 aboard a freighter,went from a career in private banking to head the Federal MaritimeCommission. In February, she was nominated by President Bush to theNo. 2 job in the far-reaching Transportation Department.   In her mid-30s, Ms. Chao is described in a department biographyas the youngest deputy secretary in the administration.   She has represented the department in White House Cabinetmeetings, traveled to oil spill sites, given speeches around thecountry and, in an emotional moment, visited a memorial honoringthe 270 victims of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland.   When a United Airlines DC-10 went down in Sioux City, Iowa, lastmonth, killing 111 people, she went to the White House to monitornews of the crash and brief Chief of Staff John Sununu asdevelopments unfolded.   Sitting in her Transportation Department office on a soft couchunder a delicate Chinese painting handed down by her grandmother,she cuts an image in sharp contrast with fast-moving, back-slappingTransportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, a former federalprosecutor.   She describes herself as well-organized and structured. Framedsignal flags on her wall express a major goal: ``smooth sailing.''   ``I like to be prepared,'' Ms. Chao said. ``But I'm learning howto handle things a little bit more spontaneously.''   She praises Skinner as a ``man of vision and a man of greatcourage'' at a time when the nation faces crises and challenges inair, sea and land transportation. Skinner has been overseeingcleanup of the Alaskan oil spill, helping to lead internationalefforts against air terrorists, pushing for tighter mileagestandards for automobiles, and trying to put together a nationaltransportation policy.   ``The secretary moves at 800 miles per hour, so his deputy hasto be able to pick up the ball and run with it,'' said CatherineBedell, Ms. Chao's press deputy.   As deputy secretary, Ms. Chao is chief operating officer for anagency that has 100,000 employees and a $28.4 billion annualbudget, with ``responsiblity for program and policy guidance oversurface, sea and air transportation.''   Ms. Chao said that as a student, a banker for BankAmerica andCiticorp and as a maritime commissioner and commission chairman,she had always been able to read enough and learn enough to knowissues better than most people around her.   Now, she said, the transportation department covers such a widerange of issues that she has to depend more on her staff.   Born on Taiwan of parents who fled mainland China, Ms. Chao saidthat although she has had little involvement in Asian issues, sheremains proud of her Chinese heritage and grateful for thesacrifices of her parents who took the risk of coming to America.   She recalls learning English by copying strange words off theblackboard and having her father painstakingly translate them forher at home so she could learn her lessons.   ``America has been the land of golden opportunity for ourfamily,'' she said at ceremonies where then-Vice President Bushswore her in as maritime chairman. ``We came with our hopes, dreamsand aspirations, and America received us with open arms and withher opportunities, her values and her decency.''   Her parents, James and Ruth Chao, live in Harrison, N.Y., wherehe is a businessman. They have four other daughters, including onestill in high school.   ``I'm actually very comfortable with numbers,'' said Ms. Chao,who has a master's degree in business administration from HarvardBusiness School and a bachelor's degree in economics from MountHolyoke College. She also has studied at Dartmouth, Columbia andthe Masschusetts Institute of Technology.   She first came to Washington six years ago as a White HouseFellow, working on President Reagan's policy staff.   She campaigned for Bush, primarily among Asian-Americans inCalifornia, and gave one of several seconding speeches for hisnomination at the Republican National Convention in New Orleanslast year.   Ms. Chao said she has felt comfortable working for both Reaganand Bush, although she considers the Reagan administration moreideological and Bush's leadership more pragmatic.   Her own approach: ``I want to get up in the morning and feelchallenged.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
