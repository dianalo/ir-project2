Shaly sandstones are difficult to evaluate because claysare conductive and they lower the resistivity of the rock. A review ofshaly-sandstone research concerning &quot;volume-of-shale&quot; equations revealsthree theoretical categories: (1) laminated clay equations, (2) dispersedclay equations, and (3) equations that assume that the effect of theclays on the conductivity measurement is directly related to water saturation.A new model for predicting the relative amounts of laminated and dispersedshales and accounting for their effects according to their abundancecan be used for any sandstone, clean or shaly. Equations representingeach of the three theoretical categories and the new equation were testedon cored Wilcox sandstones from two wells. Cores were analyzed to determinethe volume and distribution of clays and to correlate porosity with thewell logs.</TEXT></DOC>
