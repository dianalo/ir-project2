SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It seems to be getting rainier south of theEquator, unlike the north where the moisture trend has been mixed,according to a new climate study.   The report, in the January edition of the Journal of GeophysicalResearch _ Atmospheres, covers more than a century of weatherrecords and indicates increased rainfall at Southern Hemispheremeasuring stations.   Such a finding would be consistent with the recently populartheory of a greenhouse-like warming of the climate, the study noted.   The greenhouse theory holds that carbon dioxide and other gasesbeing added to the atmosphere by humans will trap an increasingamount of the sun's heat, tending to warm the earth, somewhat like agreenhouse warms its interior. Warmer weather evaporating more waterfrom the ocean could then lead to more rain.   But R.S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts, one of theauthors of the new report, was reluctant to tie the findings to thattheory.   ``We're tending to stay away from that issue. We don't want toimply it's related in any way. We're just presenting the observeddata,'' Bradley said Thursday in a telephone interview.   Nonetheless, the report noted that computer models of possiblegreenhouse effect changes do call for increased precipitation overthe Southern Hemisphere.   In addition to the increased rainfall, the new report foundindications of higher sea-surface temperatures and increased windspeeds over the southern oceans, which could lead to moreevaporation and thus more rain.   Those findings could also be a result of variations in instrumentreadings, however, the study said. It noted that because theSouthern Hemisphere is primarily water-covered there are far fewerweather measuring sites than in the more land-covered North.   The strongest rainfall increase was detected in South America,while there was a lesser effect in Australia and South Asia and notrend was evident for Southern Africa, the report said.   The study contrasts with a 1987 analysis covering areas north ofthe Equator, which had more mixed results. That report foundincreased rainfall in temperate northern areas but a decline in rainin the tropics north of the Equator.   Bradley noted that while the new findings indicate increasedrainfall in Southern Hemisphere measurig points, that doesn'tnecessarily translate to an overall increase in wetness for theplanet's southern half.   The findings could be reversed if precipitation has declined overthe vast southern ocean areas where no measurements are taken, thestudy said.   In addition, Bradley noted that rainfall, and what amounts to anincrease, can vary quite a lot from place to place. A small increasein rain over the Amazon basin, for example, could amount to adecade-worth of moisture for the northern Chile desert, for example,he said.   Overall, the new analysis concluded that rain falling on landareas in the Southern Hemisphere has increased since the 1940s,including an increase in the temperate latitudes starting in the1970s.   The report was prepared by Bradley, Henry F. Diaz of the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Environmental ResearchLaboratories and J. K. Eischeid of the University of Colorado.</TEXT></DOC>
