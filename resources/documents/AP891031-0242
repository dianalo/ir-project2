Corr, the former president of Trans World Airlines, resignedMonday to pursue other business matters, Continental said in abrief statement.   Corr declined to comment further about his reasons for leavingContinental. He would say only that he does not intend to go backto work for his former associate _ St. Louis financier Carl Icahn.   ``We regret to see Joe leave but we certainly respect hisdesires,'' Lorenzo said. ``Important operation and financialimprovement has been ongoing during Joe's tenure and we arecommitted that that improvement will continue.''   Daniel Hersh, an analyst with Los Angeles-based Bateman EichlerHill Richards said, ``It could be a signal that things are goingworse than expected.''   Hersh speculated that Continental's third-quarter results mightnot be as good as expected ``and Corr's the scapegoat.''   ``The logical reason is he couldn't get along with Lorenzo,''Hersh said. ``It's a pretty autocratic company. If Frank doesn'tagree with what you're doing, it's kind of hard to make it work.''   The airline also announced Monday that Mickey Foret, 44, wasnamed president of Continental after serving as Continental'sexecutive vice president of planning and finance. He previously wassenior vice president of Texas Air and Eastern Airlines, a TexasAir subsidiary.   Foret makes the seventh Continental president in as many years.

Plaskett, a marketing whiz hiredaway from rival American Airlines in 1986. Plaskett lasted a merenine months with Continental.   Prior to Plaskett, Philip Bakes, now head of Eastern, ranContinental. Before that was another stint by Lorenzo, who tookover when Stephen M. Wolf resigned shortly before Continental filedfor Chapter 11 protection in September 1983.
