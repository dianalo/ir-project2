Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carnation Co. agreed to pay $13 million to former shareholders to settle a class-action suit charging the food-products concern with issuing false information about its 1984 negotiations resulting in a merger with Nestle S.A.    A 1985 Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of Carnation's public statements in advance of its $3 billion acquisition by Nestle, which was completed late in 1984, led to new rules requiring companies to disclose any merger discussions when they comment on unusual market activity or rumors.    Separate cases filed by Charles Taplin and Michael Asimow, who sold Carnation shares prior to announcement of the Nestle transaction, had charged that by denying merger talks were under way Carnation had artificially depressed its stock price. Before Carnation's Sept. 4, 1984, announcement of an agreement with Nestle, company officials had denied reports of negotiations, and on Aug. 20, for example, had said there was &quot;nothing to substantiate&quot; rumors of an impending acquisition.    A spokesman in Los Angeles for the Carnation unit of Switzerland-based Nestle said Carnation &quot;continues to deny all claims and contentions&quot; of the shareholders who sued. He said, however, that &quot;further litigation would have been protracted and costly for all parties.&quot;    Ernest Kaufmann, an attorney representing Mr. Taplin, estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000 former Carnation holders might be eligible to receive payments from an escrow account established by Carnation. Eligible are all holders who sold Carnation shares from July 3 through Sept. 4, 1984. A deadline of next Feb. 16 was set for filing claims.    A Los Angeles federal judge gave preliminary approval to the settlement and set a Dec. 16 hearing for final approval.    Mr. Kaufmann, of the law firm of Kaufman Malchman Kaufmann andamp; Kirby, said the settlement doesn't affect a separate case involving alleged insider trading in the Carnation transaction. Mr. Taplin is among the Carnation holders who sued arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, the Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. unit of General Electric Co., and former Kidder executive Martin A. Siegel last February in a New York federal court.    That suit seeks more than $60 million in damages on behalf of the same class of former Carnation shareholders, claiming that Mr. Siegel's alleged disclosure to Mr. Boesky of inside information about Nestle's acquisition plans violated Kidder's and Mr. Siegel's fiduciary duty as financial advisers to Carnation. The suit draws on information disclosed by the government in its investigation of Mr. Boesky's dealings.    Nestle and Carnation began talking about a possible merger on July 19, 1984. Carnation's stock jumped $2.75 a share to $63.625 that day. It continued to climb, and closed at $75 the day before Nestle announced an $83-a-share offer. </TEXT></DOC>
