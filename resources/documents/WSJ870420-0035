The name change completes the transformation of General Felt, a closely held company that started out making carpet-backing material and later added the Knoll furniture unit and Manhattan's posh 21 Club restaurant. General Felt bought a majority stake in Knoll in 1977, and last January it acquired the remaining stake.    The switch to the company's best-known brand name follows a similar move by Consolidated Foods Corp., which recently adopted the corporate identity Sara Lee Corp., to be known by the popular brand name. Sara Lee's founder, Charles Lubin, is a Knoll director.    The company's other units include the Color Tile retailer; a subsidiary that makes foam for automobile interiors, and the Sheller-Globe auto-parts maker that is Knoll's biggest unit. </TEXT></DOC>
