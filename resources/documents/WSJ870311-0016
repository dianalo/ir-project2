The panel approved the measure on a 12-6 vote after rejecting an attempt by Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) to limit the legislation to raising funds for the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.    The measure represents a substantial change from legislation Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) had proposed last month. Mr. Proxmire's original package would have given bank holding companies new securities powers, but he backed down after Democrats on the committee said they weren't ready to decide the issue.    The legislation would also place sharp restrictions on limited-service banks, raise $7.5 billion for the FSLIC, give federal regulators broader powers to handle troubled institutions and limit the time institutions may hold a depositor's check before making the funds available for withdrawal.    Separate bills to do many of the same things are pending in the House.    The ban on granting new powers to banks would run from last Thursday to one year after the bill becomes law. In the meantime, Mr. Proxmire hopes the committee will debate the issue and make a decision by October.    But Mr. Garn said the moratorium would have just the opposite effect. &quot;The deep freeze will take pressure off the Congress,&quot; Mr. Garn warned his colleagues. &quot;We'll come to October and simply decide we better extend some of these things.&quot;    Mr. Proxmire's original proposal would have given bank holding companies the authority to underwrite municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and mutual funds.    The moratorium on granting new powers by federal bank regulators could keep the Federal Reserve Board from ruling on applications from Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. to underwrite municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper. The Fed had said it would decide the matter by next month.    In addition, the Fed currently is seeking public comment on a proposed rule allowing bank holding companies to invest in real estate development.    The bill would also bar the establishment of any new limited-service banks beginning last Thursday. Further, those institutions that were already in business as of last Thursday wouldn't be allowed either to expand their services or increase their assets more than 7% each year beginning 12 months after the bill becomes law.    Limited-service banks, also called nonbank banks, either accept deposits or make commercial loans but don't do both, skirting the legal definition of a bank. Thus, they are exempt from many of the restrictions placed on full-service banks.    Mr. Proxmire had originally sought to abolish all limited-service banks established after July 1, 1983.    Speaking to a group of thrift executives earlier yesterday, Treasury Secretary James Baker called the bill's restrictions on limited-service banks &quot;a serious mistake.&quot; These institutions have &quot;expanded both competition and service,&quot; he said. Mr. Baker declined to say whether he would recommend that President Reagan veto any legislation with checks on limited-service banks.    The $7.5 billion the legislation would raise for the FSLIC is only half of the money the Reagan administration requested. Some segments of the industry, fearing the FSLIC would move too aggressively to close thrifts if it is given the sum the administration has requested, have supported a smaller package.    House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) predicted yesterday that a subcommittee he heads would approve a two-year, $5-billion plan for the FSLIC when it meets tomorrow.    The panel also approved, without debate, the nomination of Lawrence White to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Mr. White, a 43-year-old economics professor on leave from New York University's business school, now is expected to easily win confirmation by the full Senate.    No committee action has yet been scheduled on the nomination of Lee Henkel to the Bank Board. Mr. Henkel, 58, an Atlanta tax attorney and real estate developer, is opposed by Mr. Proxmire. </TEXT></DOC>
