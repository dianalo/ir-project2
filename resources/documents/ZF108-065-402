among many of the 600 users at her site.andM;By dint of a campaign of education, complete with an elaboratedesktop-published handbook, and the installation of Vaccine, Disinfectant andother non-commercial utilities on all machines under her supervision, Alsopwas soon able to eradicate the epidemic.andP;  In fact, she said, the only timeshe saw viruses between February and last month's holidays was when Vaccineraised an alarm.andM;But this month Alsop found the mouse on her Mac IIcx behaving erratically andwindows refusing to go away.andP;  Aware of the new WDEF virus, she quicklyrebuilt her Mac desktop, and the problem disappeared.andP;  Although she hasn'tconfirmed her suspicions, she thinks it likely that WDEF had made its firstappearance on her campus.andM;Alsop's story is perhaps indicative of the state of the struggle against thevirus threat.andP;  1989 was a year of uneasy equilibrium: nVIR and its contagiouscousins continued to raise their heads, but they are by now known quantities,pesky but limited in their destructiveness.andP;  In most situations, they can becontained through conscientious education in &quot;safe computing&quot; procedures andjudicious use of the increasingly sophisticated tools available to virusfighters.andM;But WDEF, which surfaced in November on the heels of the discovery of yetanother nVIR mutation, has reminded attentive Mac users and managers thatthere are no grounds for complacency on the virus battleground.andP;  It hasspread farther and faster than any previous Mac contagion.andP;  Even moreominously, it is the first Mac virus that incorporates a &quot;stealth mechanism&quot;designed specifically to circumvent virus blockers.andM;Perhaps the most-troubling news concerns the AIDS Information program mailedto thousands of Western Europe computer users last month.andP;  It runs underMS-DOS, not the Mac, and it is not a virus, but a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; -- anon-contagious program that masks malicious purposes behind a benign facade.andM;But AIDS Information raises the specter of organized techno-terrorism.andP;  At320 Kbytes of compiled code, it is &quot;orders of magnitude more complex andinterwoven than any personal computer-based virus or 'Trojan' yetencountered,&quot; according to Santa Clara, Calif.-based &quot;virus buster&quot; JohnMcAfee.andP;  According to a Chase Manhattan Bank estimate published in theBritish computer press, the perpetrator's initial investment in disks,professional printing and packaging, and mailing must have exceeded $158,000.andM;Last month's flurry of Mac virus news sent developers of anti-virus toolsscurrying to keep pace.andP;  Symantec Corp., for instance, announced Version 1.2of its SAM package to deal with the latest nVIR mutant, canceled it in favorof a Version 1.3 designed to cope with WDEF, then within days introducedVersion 1.4 to handle a second WDEF variant.andM;In light of these developments, user-configurable anti-virus tools like JeffShulman's shareware VirusDetective DA look like an increasingly importantweapon in the modern virus-fighter's arsenal, and makers of commercialutilities are expected to add such flexibility in upcoming updates.andP;  Macmanagers are also flocking to anti-virus subscription services, a conceptpioneered by HJC Software Inc. with its Virex utility, later adopted bySymantec, and last week introduced by Mainstay for its entrant, Anti-Toxin.andM;Meanwhile, application developers are looking at ways to make Mac systemsvirus-hostile.andP;  Advanced Software Inc. has adopted anti-contaminationalgorithms developed by Michael Odawa of the Palo Alto, Calif.-based SoftwareDevelopment Council for its DocuComp utility, and Claris Corp. and Apple havenow done likewise with MacWrite II and AppleLink 5.0, respectively.andP;  Otherdevelopers are reportedly planning to follow suit.andM;Meanwhile, as Robert Morris, the alleged author of last year's Internetelectronic worm, went on trial in Syracuse, N.Y., last week,computer-conscious legislators are planning new efforts to stiffen state andfederal laws that could be used against virus writers.andP;  When Rep.andP;  WallyHerger of California's Second District introduced an anti-viral amendment tothe 1984 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1988, many of his colleagues laughedat him, according to Doug Riggins, Herger's legislative assistant.andM;Today, however, the amendment has 77 co-sponsors and should begin to movethrough the legislative process after the Morris trial, Riggins said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
