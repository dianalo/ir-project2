GIVEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texaco Inc.'s agreement to pay the government$1.25 billion to settle claims it overcharged customers during the1973-81 era of price-controls removes one uncertainty confrontingthe troubled oil giant, which has been under federal bankruptcycourt protection for nearly a year.   But the third-largest U.S. oil company still faces a complicatedexit process from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a $3 billionpayment to Pennzoil Co., a possible takeover fight with two wellknown corporate raiders and a back-tax bill of up to $6.5 billionfrom the Internal Revenue Service.   Under the overcharge-dispute settlement announced Tuesday withthe Energy Department, Texaco will pay the first installmenttotaling $400 million, with the rest to be paid over 5{ years. Itis one of the largest settlements ever reached between thegovernment and a company.   James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president, said in a statement thatthe company had set aside reserves for such a contingency and itwould have no impact on earnings.   Kinnear also said the settlement would free Texaco from what hecalled a costly and time-consuming legal process and enable thecompany to concentrate its efforts on getting out of Chapter 11federal bankruptcy protection.   The company sought bankruptcy court refuge last April because ofits protracted legal dispute with Pennzoil, which had won a record$10.3 billion judgment against the oil giant from a Texas jury thatruled Texaco unfairly sabotaged Pennzoil's plan to buy part ofGetty Oil Co.   In December Texaco settled that battle by agreeing to payPennzoil $3 billion cash, but the company's efforts to return tonormal operations have been complicated by disputes over itsbankruptcy reorganization.   In addition, the company faces a possible takeover threat fromCarl C. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder. T. Boone Pickens,another well-known takeover strategist, also has expressed interestin buying Texaco stock.   Texaco's problems have been further complicated by the IRS.Company officials said last month that the IRS had told Texaco itmay owe $6.5 billion in back taxes because of possibleundervaluations of oil purchased from Saudi Arabia from 1979-81.   Some analysts have said Texaco would be virtually destroyed ifit had to come up with that amount, but they also speculated thefinal bill would be much lower.   The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant is the latest in a lineof companies forced to relinquish large sums of cash to resolvecharges they violated pricing restrictions on crude oil and refinedproducts during the eight-year period of federal controls.   Jack Vandenberg, a spokesman for the Department of Energy inWashington, said prior to the Texaco settlement, it received about$6.1 billion in settlement funds. He said the department expects tocollect about $1 billion more to resolve similar claims, bringingthe total to $8.2 billion.   The government had argued that during the era of price controls,companies illegally profited by classifying ``old'' oil _ obtainedfrom properties producing before 1973 _ as ``new'' oil and sellingit at higher prices.   Texaco had argued that federal regulations defining old and newoil were ambiguous, but said Tuesday that challenging thegovernment on this dispute was not worth the effort.   Vandenberg said about 15 percent of the $1.25 billion settlementcovered refined product price violations, with the money destinedto go into a fund to repay injured parties.   The remaining 85 percent covers crude price violations, and afifth of that will go into the injured party fund and the rest willbe split evenly between the federal government and the states, hesaid.   Late last year, the Department of Energy extended the deadlinefor injured parties to file claims to June 30. More than 16,000claims had been filed before the extension.   The agency said at that time that a claim for a million gallonsof refined products overcharged would mean about $800 coming to theclaimant.   Most of the injured parties are businesses, school districts andmunicipalities that kept detailed records of crude oil and refinedproducts purchased from oil concerns that the government accused ofovercharging.   Other companies that have paid to settle complaints includeExxon Corp., Amoco Corp., Shell Oil Co., Mobil Corp. and AtlanticRichfield Co.</TEXT></DOC>
