The shift in investor focus from consumer product stocks to moreindustrial equities has been building for several years, butanalysts say it has intensified since the market collapsed lastOctober.   Indeed, a number of companies once relegated to the proverbialRust Belt have outperformed higher-profile conglomerates that makeidentifiable, fast-selling products.   For example, Colgate-Palmolive Co., maker of toothpaste, petfood and detergents, was trading at about $23 a share at itspost-crash low. It currently is holding at about the $44-a-sharelevel, still shy of its pre-crash October peak of $50.   Farm equipment maker Deere andamp; Co.'s performance, on the otherhand, is far more impressive. Deere recently has traded in the$50-a-share range, far beyond its post-crash low of $23 as well asits October peak of $40 a share.   While Colgate's advance appeared stalled, Deere's ``has beenvery dynamic _ a steady rise that is characteristic of a powerfultechnical advance,'' said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst atJanney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.   Analysts say the stark measures many heavy industries took overthe years _ from layoffs to paring of businesses to automation _are starting to pay off.   ``They have become lean, green, money machines, and there isn'ttoo much waste anymore,'' one trader said. To be sure, thebelt-tightening measures have made many companies far moreresistant to economic cycles than they were a decade ago.   And investors are sensitive to their new strength. Individualsare witnessing first hand the revitalization of industry.   ``They are seeing some businesses hiring back workers, factoriesexpanding,'' Peroni said.   Consumer-oriented companies themselves are not entirely in thedoldrums, although debt-laden Americans have been cutting back onspending as lackluster retail sales attest.   But these stocks are suffering from some neglect, as anyincreased focus on the industrial sector must come at the expenseof something else.   ``Traders are seeking out opportunities that are undervalued,and there's recognition of the Rust-Belt companies. There is acertain charm and interest there, since they are perceived as thenation's historic backbone,'' Peroni said.   To pair two other unlikely bedfellows, Bethlehem Steel Corp. hasmanaged to outperform Bristol-Myers Co., maker of Clairol hairproducts, Excedrin and other products.   Bristol-Myers stock has recovered from a post-crash low of about$29 a share to about $42 of late, which is still below its Octoberpeak of $53.   Bethlehem Steel, however, is trading at about $21 a share, aboveits October peak of $19 and more than double its post-crash low of$10 a share.   Analysts are divided as to whether the new focus actually spellsgood things for the economy. Some say that expansion in theindustrial sector could be viewed as inflationary, as both factoryutilization and employment increase.   As the November election nears, analysts say the presidentialcandidates are likely to tout the recovery of basic industry.   ``It's going to become prevalent to the public that we pulledourselves out of complete deterioration in the industrializedworld,'' one trader said.   It is not likely to be made apparent, however, that this newstrength carries its own price.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday June 20</NOTE></DOC>
