Already, shareholders' lawyers have notified at least a dozen companies that corporate officials may have engaged in illegal short-swing trades. These companies could wind up in court if they don't collect the profits from those trades, and they will have to pay shareholders' lawyers hefty fees for discovering any violations.    &quot;What we're seeing is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; says Jesse Brill, a securities lawyer with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco. A former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, Mr. Brill tracks legal developments affecting corporate insiders for a monthly newsletter.    Most insiders whose situations have recently come to light bought company stock in the week following the Oct. 19 plunge, after selling shares at much higher prices in the preceding six months.    But the short-swing profit rule, contained in section 16(b) of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act, works two ways: It prohibits insiders -- officers, directors and owners of 10% or more of a company's stock -- not only from buying low and selling high within six months, but also from first selling high and then buying low.    &quot;It's a profit even if the sale comes first,&quot; Mr. Brill says.    Many insiders say they learned this, to their chagrin, only after the fact. Roland C. Baer Jr., a director of Charleston, W.Va.-based Allegheny andamp; Western Energy Corp. and president of its Mountaineer Gas Co. unit, bought 3,000 Allegheny andamp; Western shares Oct. 26, when the oil and natural gas company's stock stood at $10. But in July he had sold 5,000 shares at $28.50 and another 3,000 at $27.25, giving him a short-swing profit of about $55,000 before commissions.    &quot;It was an honest mistake,&quot; he says. He plans to return his profit by year's end.    Some executives say institutional investors hurried them into buying back their companies' shares when everybody else was selling. David Downey, chairman of Downey Designs International Inc. in Indianapolis, which remounts diamonds and other gems as a while-you-wait service in department stores, says many institutional investors were &quot;calling up in October wanting to unload, and others were saying, 'Do something,'&quot; he says. &quot;I started this company 24 years ago. It's my baby. I wasn't about to sit by and do nothing.&quot;    Mr. Downey blames his company's &quot;high-priced New York lawyers for not warning me I could be doing something illegal. 'You screwed up,' they told me (afterward),&quot; he says.    A week after the crash, when Mr. Downey bought 50,000 shares, the stock was at $3.50, well below its initial offering price of $6 on June 17. As part of the offering, Mr. Downey had sold 187,500 shares. His short-swing profit from the two transactions amounted to about $94,000 after underwriting fees and brokerage commissions.    &quot;It seems like I am in violation of the rule,&quot; he says, &quot;but I haven't taken any action yet. I'm waiting to hear back from my attorneys.&quot;    That he remains the company's largest stockholder &quot;isn't much solace,&quot; he says, adding that the stock has fallen further, to $3.125, &quot;and I can't do anything with (the shares) for another six months.&quot;    Although the short-swing rule may appear simple, securities lawyers say it has many gray areas. For example, they say court decisions haven't established a clear precedent for cases involving stock purchases by or for members of an insider's immediate family. James Moore, a vice president of California Energy Co., bought company stock in late October for his children's savings accounts. He says it could cost him $24,300.    On Sept. 9, Mr. Moore sold 7,000 shares at $6.90 in California Energy, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that is developing geothermal power plants. On Oct. 23, he bought 5,000 shares at $3.75 and four days later another 2,000 shares at $2.625.    Some federal courts have ruled that an insider has to prove that only the children benefited from such transactions, but in one case &quot;an insider who had trusts for his kids wasn't held liable even though he was a co-trustee,&quot; says Peter Romeo, a partner in the Washington law firm of Hogan andamp; Hartson.    Mr. Moore says, &quot;I'm a geologist, not a lawyer, but I've learned a lot about rule 16(b) in the past month.&quot; He says preliminary responses from his own lawyer and the company's counsel hold that he didn't violate the rule. &quot;Whatever I'm advised, I'll do,&quot; he says.    In all of these cases, the possible infractions were uncovered by lawyers who specialize in pursuing short-swing violators. In fact, enforcement of the short-swing rule effectively rests with these lawyers. That's because the 1934 law makes the courts, rather than the SEC, responsible for seeing that short-swing profits go back to the companies. But only shareholders can initiate any action against short-swing traders.    The information that leads these lawyers to possible violations is contained in Form 4 filings, required of insiders on any company stock transaction. But lawyers in the field maintain that many short-swing trades go undetected, either because they get lost in the mountain of filings or because insiders simply ignore the filing requirement and get away with it.    Typically, a lawyer first uncovers a possible case of short-swing profits, then finds a shareholder on whose behalf to act. The lawyer next notifies the company involved, which contacts the insider. Most cases involving a violation get settled without going to court: The insider simply returns the money.    The incentive for these lawyers: Companies must pay them fees of up to one-third of the amounts recovered. (When more than one lawyer finds the same violation, the fee goes to the first to notify the company.) Company shareholders, meanwhile, receive no direct payment; they gain only indirectly, through an enriched corporate treasury. </TEXT></DOC>
