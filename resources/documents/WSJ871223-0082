The crudely drawn caricature of the chief, with the caption &quot;Bloody Puppet,&quot; shows him plunging a spear into a black man's back while dangling from strings manipulated by a white hand called apartheid.    &quot;It becomes very difficult to get reconciliation going,&quot; he groans, &quot;when people talk this kind of language.&quot;    Mr. Buthelezi, who publicly prefers the language of moderation and non-violence, is an angry and frustrated man these days. As a hereditary leader of the vast Zulu tribe and the elected chief minister of the South African government-created black homeland of KwaZulu, he is certainly no stranger to criticism: Radical black organizations have long scorned him as being too close to the white regime. But with the increasing polarization of South African politics in recent months, the animosity between him and his opponents has been growing and the chances of reconciliation fading.    &quot;It is a situation that causes desperation and anger on both sides, black and white,&quot; he says.    In a 90-minute interview at his KwaZulu headquarters in Ulundi, Mr. Buthelezi is pessimistic about reducing these tensions soon. &quot;At the moment,&quot; he says, &quot;there is no rationale for being optimistic.&quot;    The main source of his gloom is the escalating hostility between rival anti-apartheid groups. He says there isn't a quick solution to the feud raging between members of his Zulu-based Inkatha organization and supporters of the multiracial United Democratic Front, or UDF. Both aim to topple the apartheid system, but the strategic differences between them have erupted in savage fighting in the black townships near the city of Pietermaritzburg, where more than 200 people have been killed in the past year. &quot;We are poles apart,&quot; he says.    He blames the UDF and the outlawed African National Congress, or ANC, for portraying him and Inkatha &quot;as the bad guys. . . that we are the ones who are committed to violence.&quot; Instead, he says, the ANC, which employs terrorism as part of its strategy to overthrow the government, has &quot;been determined to make the country ungovernable. They have said to the world that there is nothing left except to kill to change the system.&quot;    But not all of Mr. Buthelezi's scorn is reserved for his black rivals. He is equally critical of the government for moving too slowly with political and social reform and then sometimes reversing whatever actions it takes. He says any intentions the government may have had to further scale back apartheid and to give blacks greater political participation have &quot;become frozen&quot; since the right-wing Conservative Party emerged as the official parliamentary opposition, replacing the liberal Progressive Federal Party, in last May's whites-only election.    He cites two recent examples of backsliding. One involves the government's release of jailed ANC member Govan Mbeki: At first it said Mr. Mbeki's release was unconditional, but when the right wing reacted with outrage, it quickly slapped restrictions on Mr. Mbeki's freedom of movement and speech.    The other was the government's sharp criticism of the Indaba, a regional multiracial power-sharing arrangement in the KwaZulu-Natal region, shortly after State President P.W. Botha participated in inaugurating one of its branches. This prompted Mr. Buthelezi, who has been at the forefront of the Indaba, to threaten Inkatha's withdrawal.    &quot;Mr. Botha suddenly looks over his right shoulder more than he should,&quot; the chief says. &quot;And therefore the reform program has come to a halt.&quot;    In the past, many of these reforms have been aimed at enticing black leaders, in particular Mr. Buthelezi, to join the government's proposed National Council, which is to be a multiracial advisory body. The chief has said he won't participate unless conditions are met, like the release of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and he indicates a growing frustration with Pretoria's carrots.    &quot;Why should I always be the one who is enticeable?&quot; he asks. &quot;It attacks my integrity to say that everything is done to entice me. I've been in politics long enough and I'm not a prostitute.&quot;    He also says he has been in politics long enough to realize that an end to the black struggle for equality isn't around the corner. He says this is partly due to government intransigence, but he lays most of the blame on feuding blacks. &quot;Black-white reconciliation cannot get off the ground while the black-on-black conflict goes on,&quot; he says. &quot;That is the most serious obstacle.&quot;    While he admits that his oft-repeated strategy of nonviolence and negotiation hasn't brought total success, neither has the ANC's strategy of armed struggle, he says. &quot;They have been at it for 25 years and they haven't toppled the government,&quot; he says. &quot;And there is no way in the foreseeable future that they will do so.&quot;    He argues that blacks should unite around a strategy of peaceful protest, using &quot;our worker power and our consumer power&quot; to force the government into negotiations. He wouldn't specify what form that protest could take, saying only, &quot;those strategies cannot be used effectively if there is no closing of ranks, if people don't stand together.&quot;    At the moment, the UDF favors economic sanctions and corporate disinvestment as a way of pressuring the government and opposes any negotiations with Pretoria under the current state of emergency; Mr. Buthelezi and Inkatha oppose any steps that will unduly damage the economy, and believe that a negotiated solution is the only way out of South Africa's problems.    The peace talks among anti-apartheid forces at Pietermaritzburg are progressing slowly, as each side accuses the other for inciting the violence. Some UDF supporters have alleged threats and assaults by Inkatha members, and several Inkatha men have been hit with court restraining orders. While he argues that his supporters have an &quot;inalienable right&quot; to defend themselves, Mr. Buthelezi says &quot;we never see that we should use violence to force other people to fall in line with us.&quot;    He produces anti-Inkatha publications and quotations -- including the cartoon -- that he attributes to the UDF and ANC. &quot;At the same time they're talking peace {in Pietermaritzburg}, their utterances in their broadcasts and publications is that they want a fight to the finish,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
