In a luncheon interview with out-of-town reporters, the presidentwas asked what he would say to the families of the victims ofThursday's rampage by a man who used a AK-47 assault rifle and otherweapons to shoot 20 of his former co-workers, killing seven of themand himself.   ``I would tell them, I feel horrible about the loss of life ... Iwould tell them we must do everything we can to enforce laws thatare already on the books,'' Bush replied.   The president has banned the import of foreign-made assaultrifles into the United States, including the Chinese-made AK-47.However, possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and Bushhas taken no steps toward proposing curbs on U.S. manufacture ofsuch weapons.   Bush answered a wide range of questions with a group of reportersafter a luncheon in the State Dining Room.   On his anti-drug plan, he said he was ready to bargain with theDemocratic-led Congress to come up with a compromise for paying forthe program.   And while the president said he still prefers hisadministration's formula for funding his $7.9 billion program,``we're flexible.''   Bush also acknowledged that overlapping responsibilities andmissions of various law and drug enforcement agencies were sometimesgetting in the way of effective enforcement.   He said that his drug policy director, William J. Bennett, isworking on better coordination ``to try to cope with thebureaucratic competition that exists. I can't tell you we've got itwhipped; I can tell you we've made progress.''   The president reiterated his decision not to press for a taxincrease to help pay for his war on drugs. ``A tax increase would becounterproductive,'' he said.   On next week's education summit with governors inCharlottesville, Va., Bush said, ``we're going to have someroll-up-your-sleeves meetings.''   He said that, overall, U.S. educational performance wasdisappointing, measured against achievement of students in otherindustrialized nations. ``We're getting less in terms of ourinvestment,'' he said.   On the subject of guns, the president, a longtime opponent ofgun-control legislation, noted that many local government do havemeasures banning automatic and semi-automatic weapons.   Bush said Thursday's shootings in Louisville reminded him, as aTexan, of a 1966 incident in which a sniper who occupied a tower onthe campus of the University of Texas in Austin shot 44 people,killing 16.   ``It is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible. But Ihave seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is goingto guard against it ...,'' he said.   ``So, my view is: do everything you can in terms of education, doeverything you can in terms of enforcing your laws that are on thebooks.''   Bush recalled that years ago, he went to register his own huntingguns to comply with a District of Columbia law requiringregistration of all firearms.   He said he asked the clerk if ``criminals'' had complied with thelaw and was told, in return, that no, just ``a bunch of suckers likeyou ....''   Bush also said he was strongly opposed to the legalization ofdrugs and that it would never be given consideration at the federallevel as long as he was president.   Returning to the issue of new taxes for fighting crime and drugs,the president said that, while he wouldn't advocate new federaltaxes for building new prisons, he could understand if state andlocal governments raised taxes.   ``Yes, the states and localities are having to step up themselvesand do stuff .... That's up to them. I'm not going to criticize agovernor or a municipality that has to do something on the revenueside,'' he said.   ``I'm going to try to hold the line as president of the UnitedStates on federal taxes.''   In the only question on international affairs, Bush was asked ifthe United States should consider diverting U.S. funds from theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization to help finance the war on drugs.   He said that the United States could not afford to back off itsmilitary ommitment to NATO, saying it needs to prudently deal withthe threat from the Soviet Union. ``I think I'm doing what's in thenational interest of the United States,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
