The Alaska Supreme Court in December and a Southern CaliforniaSuperior Court judge in February ruled that tribes have no right tointervene in adoption proceedings involving Eskimo or Indianchildren if the mother gives up the child voluntarily.   Representatives of Indian and Eskimo rights groups in Alaska andthe Lower 48 have criticized the rulings, saying they violate theintent of the Indian Child Welfare Act.   ``Essentially, the Alaska Supreme Court has sanctioned aloophole'' in the federal law, said Lloyd Miller, a lawyer for theAnchorage-based Cook Inlet Tribal Council.   The tribal council earlier this year appealed the state SupremeCourt's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the panel declinedto hear the appeal.   The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted by Congress in 1978after it reviewed evidence that up to 50 percent of some tribes'children nationally had been put up for adoption.   Congress agreed with Indian advocates that adoption of Indianchildren by non-Indian parents was threatening the integrity oftribal groups and that such adoptions can cause long-term soct Tribal Council,wasn't notified. The mother later changed hermind and sought the council's assistance to recover her child.   ``If the birth parent asks to remain anonymous, in other words,chooses not to have the tribe notified, we believe the mother'sright to privacy supersedes the tribe's right to be notified,''said Jim Caldarola, executive director of Catholic Social Services,the state's largest private adoption agency.   But Indian groups contend the Indian Child Welfare Act was meantto protect the child's rights, not the mother's.   The second case involves an Aleut girl from the Kodiak Islandvillage of Akhiok. Her 19-year-old mother from Cypress, Calif.,decided to give up her child to a non-Aleut couple in Canada, butAkhiok village leaders learned of the case and want the child back.   ``We're trying to get the baby out of Canada and back down hereto our community,'' said Akhiok Tribal Council President DavidEluska. ``Too many of our tribal members in the past have beenadopted out and we have no idea or inkling where they ended up.''   State, tribal officials and Indian advocates believe that whenchildren are not adopted by their own people, they are removed fromtheir ancestral heritage and thrust into a sort of cultural andethnic limbo.   From 1985 through 1987, the last year for which statistics areavailable, 474 Eskimo and Indian children were adopted, accordingto the Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics. Ninety-two were adoptedby couples who were neither Eskimo nor Indian.   State officials agree the notification issue creates a loopholein federal law.   ``The state's position is that the notice should be required,''said Myra Munson, commissioner of the state Department of Healthand Social Services. ``We believe it (the federal law) should beamended.''   Indian advocates have said the court cases are important, notjust to Alaska but to the entire country.   ``It's of a great deal of importance nationally,'' said JackTrope, a lawyer with the New York-based Association of AmericanIndian Affairs, a non-profit legal aid and advocacy group concernedabout Indian issues.   ``Up until very recently the tribes were certain under the actthat they had the right to intervene,'' Trope said.   The recent case ``indicated that the right to intervention isnot as clear cut in the act as everyone thought. That's of greatconcern.''   Trope predicts legal battles across the country to clarify thelaw.   ``We'll certainly be looking to fight these things in the courtsystem,'' he said. ``The law is on our side, notwithstanding whatthe Alaska Supreme Court says.''</TEXT></DOC>
