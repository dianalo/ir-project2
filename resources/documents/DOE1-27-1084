The interest in their applicationshas increased since the discovery of the CR-39. CR-39 is the most sensitiveplastic track detector presently known and also allows the highest chargeand mass resolution for (not very) heavy ions. The authors are reportingabout a previously unknown side effect of the CR-39. It was found thatif stacks of CR-39 were left together for several days, the sensitivityof the detectors decreased significantly. The sensitivity decrease iscaused by the increased bulk etch rate of the detectors. One of the seriousconsequences of this side effect is that the heavy ion dose componentof the cosmic ray on stacks of CR-39 was found to be about 100 timeshigher in many cases than was previously reported. The authors showedthat the high multiplicity events in high energy U beams are actual andcould not be repeatedly observed in later experiments because of thestack-effect. Therefore, they planned new experiments to study theseevents in more detail. A fully automatic image analysis system had tobe developed to find and analyse these rare events. This system can alsobe used for LET spectroscopy and heavy ion radiography. The softwarecan easily be transferred to faster hardware.</TEXT></DOC>
