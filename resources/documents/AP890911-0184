Yeltsin said Monday.   Gorbachev has ``not more than one year and probably about sixmonths,'' the Soviet deputy told a television interviewer. IfGorbachev fails, ``then we're going to have some very difficulttimes. And this is something I want to discuss with the Americanadministration.''   Yeltsin, 58, a maverick ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chiefin 1987 but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popularsupport in a contested election, arrived Saturday for a two-weekU.S. tour during which he hoped to see President Bush.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``At thispoint no decision has been made'' on whether Bush will meet withYeltsin.   Yeltsin will meet in Washington with Secretary of State James A.Baker III, on Tuesday afternoon, to discuss ``the process of changein the Soviet Union,'' said Richard Boucher, a State Departmentspokesman.   ``The unfolding of this process is something that will bedetermined within the Soviet Union,'' Boucher said. ``We areinterested observers, more than anything else.''   Yeltsin spoke on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program, andlater made a visit to a temple of capitalism, the New York StockExchange. He also spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations, at alunch closed to the press.   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimovasserted that Yeltsin's views were his own and not necessarily thegovernment's. He said deputies visiting the ubited States ``are allunofficial delegations.''   ``If you want the official point of view, listen to the ForeignMinistry,'' he said. ``If you want pluralism, listen to thedeputies.''   Yeltsin, in his TV appearance, said Gorbachev could face``revolution from below.''   He added: ``This has already started in the form of strikes, buttoday just occasional strikes, hot spots here and there in thecountry. A revolution would occur when these hot spots spread andthe whole country is affected.''   Early in the interview, Yeltsin gestured with the middle fingerof his hand. Later the interviewer, Charles Gibson, explained thatit had not been what Americans might interpret as an obscene gesture.   Yeltsin was injured by a hand grenade when he was 11 and``because he is missing two fingers, that's the only way he canpoint,'' said Gibson.   At the stock exchange, Yeltsin chatted for about half an hourwith the chairman, John J. Phelan Jr., then got a tour of thetrading floor.   Yeltsin's visit was being organized by the Esalen InstituteSoviet-American Exchange Program. He is receiving $25,000 perspeech, which will pay for the trip and contribute to AIDS researchin the Soviet Union.   At Columbia University later Monday, Yeltsin did not discount thechances of a second political party gaining power in the SovietUnion in the future.   ``But our country is not ready,'' he told a audience of about700. ``It has trouble supporting a single party as it is.''   He told the group that Soviet people should ``throw off our falsepride and take a lot from the American experience'' of running acountry.   If the Soviet Union is to solve its economic and social problems,the Politburo needs to be revamped, Yeltsin said.   ``We have so many odious and incompetent people in thePolitburo,'' he said. ``All they do is raise questions and neveranswer them. They are hanging on to their positions with dear life.We need to catapult them out like they do with ejection seats. Butthe question is who is willing to push the button?''</TEXT></DOC>
