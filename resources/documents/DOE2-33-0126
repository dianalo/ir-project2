Langmuir-Blodgettfilms consisting of mixtures of stearic acid and alkylsubstituted polythiopheneshave also been made as bilayer films. The orientation of single and multilayerfilms on platinum substrates have been studied by Near Edge X-ray AbsorptionFine Structure Spectroscopy which also gives information about chargetransfer interactions between the aromatic groups and the metallic substrates.The alkylsubstituted pyrroles form highly ordered two-dimensional structures.FeCl{sub 3} initiated copolymerization with unsubstituted pyrrole leadsto a more disordered system. In the case of polythiophene-stearic acidbilayers, the stearic acid layers are highly ordered. The poly(alkylthiophene) layers sandwiched between stearic acid layers, on the otherhand, exhibit random orientation of the thiophene moieties. 15 refs.,3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
