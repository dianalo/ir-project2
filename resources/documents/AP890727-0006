Canadian officials allege that as the U.S. boat, the Bountiful,entered U.S. waters just before 4 p.m., it turned and rammed thepatrol boat Cygnus, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason said.   No one was injured and neither boat was seriously damaged, hesaid.   The Bountiful was allegedly seven nautical miles into Canadianfishing waters and 165 miles east of Nantucket when it was spottedby the Cygnus at 2:30 p.m., Coast Guard spokesmen said.   The Cygnus asked Canadian authorities for permission to firewarning shots across the Bountiful's bow to force the Americanskipper to halt, but as of 10:30 p.m. permission to fire was beingwithheld, Mason said.   The Coast Guard has radioed the Bountiful to recommend that itstop for its own safety, but it planned not to interfere unless theCanadian government specifically requested help, he said.   ``We have one of our vessels over the horizon, just out ofsight, trailing along,'' Mason said.   Mason estimated that the Bountiful is about the 10th Americanfishing boat to be accused of poaching in Canadian waters this year.   Such incidents are on the rise because fishing stocks on theU.S. side of the fisheries line are being depleted and theCanadians are aggressively patrolling their waters, he said.   At 10:30 p.m., the Bountiful and the Cygnus were about 120 mileseast of Cape Cod, heading toward shore, Mason said.</TEXT></DOC>
