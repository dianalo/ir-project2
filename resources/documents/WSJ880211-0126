The investigation will cover trading in Peachey securities on May 8, 1987, including any transactions that may have been connected with John Ritblat, chairman of British Land Co., the department said. A spokesman declined to elaborate.    John Brown, Peachey managing director, said the company notified London's stock exchange last May of two large block trades in Peachey: the sale by Real Property andamp; Finance Corp., a British Land unit, of 2,545,000 shares, or a 7.35% stake, and the purchase by Bell Group International Ltd., the British arm of Bell Group Ltd. of Australia, of 2,500,000 shares, or 7.22%.    Mr. Brown said that he didn't know of any activity at Peachey at the time to spark the large trades and that there aren't any business ties between Peachey and British Land. Bell Group sold its holding in June 1987, Mr. Brown added, and Peachey isn't aware of any current holdings by British Land or Bell Group.    Officials at British Land weren't available for comment. Derek Williams, treasurer of Bell Group International, declined to comment on the inquiry but said Bell bought its Peachey shares from a securities firm, not from the British Land unit. </TEXT></DOC>
