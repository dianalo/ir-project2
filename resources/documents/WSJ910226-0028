Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the new budget is&quot;the most difficult&quot; of the seven budgets he has draftedsince he became finance minister in 1984.</LP><TEXT>   The government is under heavy pressure to restrainspending because of its budget deficit, which is expected tototal about 30 billion Canadian dollars (US$26.03 billion) inthe fiscal year ending March 31. Proportionately, theCanadian deficit is similar in size to the U.S. deficit.   The country's major business groups have jointly urged thegovernment to freeze its program spending for the next twoyears to bring the deficit under control. The federal debtcurrently totals about C$385 billion, or 57% of grossnational product, the second highest ratio after Italy amongmajor industrial nations.   Mr. Wilson has only limited scope for spending cutsbecause of the recession that started between April and Juneof last year. He's widely expected to trim transfer paymentsto provinces, which account for about 23% of federal programspending.   Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia senior economist, saidthe new budget will be a &quot;damage control&quot; exercise because,at a time of recession, the government has only limited roomto cut spending.   The government's &quot;hands are tied&quot; said Ted Carmichael,senior economist with Burns Fry Ltd., a Toronto-basedsecurities concern.   Finance Minister Wilson is expected to rely on declininginterest rates to spur a recovery in the Canadian economy.Since May, short-term Canadian interest rates have declinedabout four percentage points, but they still remain about 31/2 points above comparable U.S. rates.   Most commercial banks have lowered their prime lendingrates to 11.25% from 14.75% in August. The prime rate is abenchmark for various lending charges.   Mr. Wilson told the House of Commons yesterday that &quot;thebest thing we can do for the economy is continue to bringinterest rates down.&quot;   So far, the economy has shown little response to theinterest rate decline. The unemployment rate is currently9.7%, and manufacturers' unfilled orders have declined forfive consecutive months.   Many economists, however, are predicting that lowerinterest rates will spur an economic recovery this summer.&quot;Monetary policy got us into this recession, and monetarypolicy is going to bail us out,&quot; said Neil Johnson, chiefeconomist at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. He predicted that infiscal 1992, Canada will have three quarters of &quot;fairlyrobust growth.&quot;   Despite the decline in interest rates, the Canadian dollarhas remained steady in recent months. Yesterday, the currencyclosed at 86.78 U.S. cents.</TEXT></DOC>
