A worried Treasury Secretary James Baker proposed to end the two-week-old budget talks with Congress and cut a quick deal.    But in a meeting of top administration officials with President Reagan two days later, Budget Director James Miller attacked the package that Mr. Baker had brought to the president, saying it &quot;isn't worth taking.&quot; The president sided with his budget chief and sent his men back to the table to &quot;get me more&quot; from Congress.    Mr. Reagan's instructions sparked another eight days of high-stakes negotiations. But in the end, the president got little. Friday, he gave his consent to a deficit-cutting agreement remarkably similar to the one he had rejected the previous week.    The failure to produce a substantial deficit-reduction package in the face of a financial market crisis makes clear that serious efforts to close the budget gap must wait until a new president takes office in 1989. Unless an even graver crisis than the Oct. 19 stock-market collapse occurs, no significant progress will be made next year. &quot;We had a chance to do something great, and we let the ring pass us by,&quot; says Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.    The negotiators, however, did come close to a bold stroke by flirting with the politically explosive idea of reducing big middle-class entitlements.    On Friday the 13th of November, Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) was joined by House Budget Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) and Sen. Packwood in proposing that cost-of-living increases for all entitlement programs, including Social Security, be postponed for three months, and that appropriated accounts be frozen for six months. This would have reduced the deficit by a solid $34 billion this fiscal year.    The negotiators were buoyed by the plan, which they dubbed &quot;PGP,&quot; after its authors. But the idea died when neither congressional leaders nor the White House were willing to take the first step to promote it. (Rep. Gray would later joke that PGP &quot;sounded too much like an insecticide&quot; to succeed.)    The episode illustrated how President Reagan was a reactive player in the budget bargaining, reflecting his reluctance to be involved in the talks in the first place. Until the final week, his negotiators never put forward a plan of their own. Instead, they found themselves repeatedly responding to proposals from members of Congress. &quot;In retrospect,&quot; concedes one administration official, &quot;that was a mistake.&quot;    The president's lack of involvement piqued key lawmakers. At one point during talks between administration officials and congressional leaders, Budget Director Miller suggested that more progress would be made if the congressional staff was dismissed from the room. &quot;Fine,&quot; snapped House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). &quot;We'll keep in our elected officials if you send in yours.&quot;    Even its framers concede that the final budget-reduction plan is timid and tenuous. Nearly a quarter of the proposed $30.2 billion package for the current fiscal 1988 year comes from measures that have virtually no long-term effect on the deficit.    And because the package's modest spending &quot;cuts&quot; are derived from inflated projections, they will allow most government accounts to continue to expand. With a slowdown in economic growth likely next year, the agreement probably won't even prevent the deficit from swelling above its $148 billion fiscal 1987 level.    Congress still faces a hard road in the next few weeks as it converts the three-page agreement into thousands of pages of legislation, but the odds favor enactment of the plan. With the backing of the president and of congressional leaders from both parties, even foes of the compromise aren't predicting its demise.    The struggle over the budget package began Oct. 20, the day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508.00 points. Under prodding by Treasury Secretary Baker and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker -- informally referred to as &quot;the Baker boys&quot; -- and by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, President Reagan agreed to end his firm opposition to tax increases and to begin talks with congressional leaders about developing a plan that would substitute for spending cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman law. The goal was to demonstrate to nervous financial markets that policy makers in Washington could still govern.    The talks over the next month resembled a roller-coaster ride, with negotiators fluctuating between modest plans that papered over the problem and broader proposals that attacked the politically sacrosanct Social Security program. Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) was one of the first to raise the Social Security issue. He importuned the president for more leeway during a meeting of GOP lawmakers at the White House on Friday, Nov. 6. Mr. Reagan's answer indicated he wouldn't initiate a proposal to tamper with Social Security, but he would look at the negotiators' product.    This was seen as an opening to a small band of legislators -- mostly senators-who wanted to pare cost-of-living adjustments in federal programs. The group became known as the &quot;COLA caucus.&quot; Others less sympathetic to the cause -- the &quot;unCOLAs&quot; -- saw in the president's statement ruling Social Security &quot;off the table&quot; a resistance to reopening an issue that had been used as a political bludgeon against Republicans in the past.    After the Nov. 6 meeting with the president, House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.) ventured a plan that didn't contain Social Security reductions, but did include a higher tax increase and a deeper reduction in military spending than earlier GOP proposals. In response, the Democrats offered a compromise plan that also avoided the &quot;S word,&quot; but moved closer to the Republican position. The two sides seemed slowly to be reaching a compromise on a minimal package.    The market turbulence on the morning of Nov. 10 provided a new incentive to the negotiators. They met that day and again on Wednesday, Nov. 11, when most of Washington was trapped at home by a blinding snowstorm. Working in a conference room off the Senate floor in a largely deserted Capitol, the negotiators tried to find the middle ground between the Michel plan and the Democratic proposal.    The next morning, the White House team briefed the president on the proposal. The two Bakers indicated a desire to wind up the talks. But Defense Secretary-designate Frank Carlucci was concerned about the defense spending figure, and Budget Director Miller worried that some of the supposed savings in entitlement programs were phony.    Mr. Miller argued strongly against the package. He appealed to a fear held by the president that Congress might renege, warning: &quot;Mr. President, you've had agreements before that weren't carried out.&quot;    Unable to reach agreement, the negotiators detoured into the Friday the 13th attempt to include cuts in Social Security. But in weekend television interviews, several negotiators criticized any plan that reduced Social Security benefits. And on Monday, Social Security advocate Rep. Claude Pepper (D., Fla.), the oldest member of Congress, promised at a news conference to fight any such plan.    Behind the closed doors of the negotiations last Monday, it quickly became clear that neither side was willing to move first on the volatile Social Security issue. House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), chairman of the talks, asked Secretary Baker whether the White House would consider changing COLA programs, including Social Security. According to participants, Mr. Baker replied that the president considered Social Security off the table, but he would look at whatever the negotiators came up with.    Rep. Gray then asked House Republicans what they thought. Rep. Michel looked up and down. Rep. Trent Lott (R., Miss.), the second-ranking Republican in the House, said he would rather find savings from entitlement programs other than Social Security. Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.), who faces reelection, was also antsy about reducing COLAs. Rep. Gray concluded that the Social Security option appeared to be &quot;a fruitless effort.&quot;    Meantime, the outlines of the modest package began to filter out, and many Republicans on Capitol Hill felt betrayed. On Wednesday evening, Rep. Michel and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) went to the White House to warn the president that their members were in revolt.    Thursday, the package was rejected overwhelmingly by the GOP caucuses in both the House and the Senate. Secretary Baker returned to the negotiations after attending the House GOP caucus, opened his suit coat and said, &quot;See the blood?&quot;    The negotiators became discouraged, but seeing no alternative, they continued to work. There were two last sticking points.    Thursday night, House Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski and Secretary Baker had a final showdown. The chairman offered to eliminate all of the revenue-losing provisions in his tax bill, as the GOP had requested, if the secretary would accept a $10 billion tax increase, rather than the $9 billion they had been discussing. Secretary Baker refused, and Rep. Rostenkowski stormed away. &quot;I can't negotiate with these people,&quot; he said, and gave his proxy to the respected Rep. Foley. The result was that Secretary Baker got his way -- at least, for now.    Another final sticking point came from Budget Director Miller, who had been insisting that the congressional leaders make a strong commitment to fixed appropriation numbers for defense and international affairs over the next two years. But House Appropriations Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) had balked. As the agreement was being wrapped up Friday, Mr. Miller wrote down fiscal 1988 and 1989 appropriations numbers, handed out copies to the other negotiators and insisted they be included in the agreement. Reluctantly, Rep. Whitten agreed.    To the very end, members of the COLA caucus hoped that something more substantial might be agreed to at the last minute. But in the group's final meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, President Reagan sat down and read a prepared statement, without any discussion.    ---   Ellen Hume contributed to this article.    ---               Comparing Deficit-Reduction Options            Changes from projected fiscal 1988 levels                    (In billions of dollars)                                Gramm-                                Rudman         Compromise    Military                    $-11.5            $-5.0    Non-Military                 -11.5             -6.6    Taxes                          0.0             +9.0</TEXT></DOC>
