Results show that theresponse of a device to a particle strike can be very fast but stronglydepends on the LET (Linear Energy Transfer) of the particle. The risetime dependence with different parameters such as the doping density,bias, at different energies with different particles, is also persented.The data are then compared to the predictions of existing models. 7 refs.,12 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
