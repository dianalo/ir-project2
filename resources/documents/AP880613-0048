The test works by detecting genetic material from the virus,rather than the standard method of detecting the proteins asevidence of possible infection, scientists said.   The proteins, called antibodies, form in reaction to exposure tothe AIDS virus. A mother's antibodies can pass to the fetus andmake the infant appear to have been exposed to the virus whenstandard testing is used.   The study, led by Steven Wolinsky at Northwestern UniversityMedical School in Chicago, is to be reported this week in Sweden atthe Fourth International Conference on AIDS.   It used a ``polymerase chain reaction'' technique, called PCR,to detect genetic material from the virus causing acquired immunedeficiency syndrome.   Part of the test focused on nine children, ages 6 months to 3years, who had tested positive by standard tests. Three testednegative by PCR and later were shown to be free of the virus. Thesix others, scored positive by PCR, later showed other signs ofinfection.   In a different group of five children who had tested positive bystandard tests, three scored positive by the PCR test and latershowed other evidence of infection. The two others, who testednegative with PCR, were found to be free of the virus.   Five children who tested negative by standard tests also scorednegative with PCR.   A second study by Wolinsky and colleagues confirmed otherdemonstrations that PCR can detect infection in adults before theytest positive on antibody-based tests.   Tests of stored blood samples suggested that 16 of 18 men whotested positive on a standard antibody test would have testedpositive at least six months earlier with a PCR test. For one man,the difference was 42 months, researchers said.</TEXT></DOC>
