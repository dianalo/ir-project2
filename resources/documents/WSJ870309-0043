An investment group headed by Taft's vice chairman, Dudley S. Taft, offered to acquire the Cincinnati-based broadcasting concern for $145 a share in a transaction valued at about $1.35 billion.    Taft common stock soared $19 a share Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading to close at $151.50, well above the proposed acquisition price.    The move by Mr. Taft, members of his family and Narragansett Capital Inc., a Providence, R.I.-based investment firm, may force the company to finally decide its fate after several weeks of indecision and dissent. Over the past several months Taft has taken some major restructuring steps, including selling five independent television stations and putting its entertainment group on the block, but hasn't indicated where its activities will lead.    For weeks the company's major shareholders have been discussing possibly selling all or part of Taft, according to Wall Street executives. Besides Mr. Taft, who with his family owns about 12% of the common shares outstanding, the major shareholders include an investment group headed by Robert M. Bass of Fort Worth, Texas, with a 25% stake, and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp., who owns 16% of the company. Messrs. Bass and Lindner have been acquiring shares in the company since 1985, and in recent months have been competing to increase their stakes.    &quot;Mr. Taft is forcing the issue,&quot; said Peter Appert, a broadcast securities analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. Rather than let the other major holders buy the company &quot;bit by bit, he's forcing them to make a decision now. From Mr. Taft's perspective, either he will end up running the show or he's going to end up with a lot of money,&quot; Mr. Appert said.    In an interview, however, Mr. Taft said he simply wants to return the company &quot;to family control.&quot; His father founded the concern in 1939. There have been rumors for some time that Mr. Taft was unhappy with the changes taking place at the company and was preparing to resign.    The Taft family is one of the most prominent in Ohio, where the family's name is synonymous with broadcasting and politics. Among the relatives are William Howard Taft, the nation's 27th president and U.S. Senator Robert Taft. The Taft family entered journalism in 1873 when it purchased the old Cincinnati Star newspaper. But it was Mr. Taft's father, Hulbert Taft Jr., who expanded the family business into broadcasting with the purchase of Cincinnati radio station WKRC in 1939.    Taft owns several network-affiliated radio and television stations and an entertainment division that syndicates television programming and produces live-action and animated programs. The company also has interests in cable television and amusement theme parks.    Taft has taken several restructuring moves in recent months designed to reduce its presence in certain broadcasting areas. In November, the company agreed to sell its five independent television stations, at a loss, to Virginia Beach, Va.-based TVX Broadcast Group Inc. for $240 million. That transaction has not been made final yet. Several weeks ago, Taft said it would &quot;consider&quot; selling all or part of its entertainment division, which accounted for about 30% of the company's fiscal 1986 revenue. Meanwhile, Taft has expanded its presence in cable television, teaming up last December with the Bass family to buy Wometco Cable Co. for $620 million.    For its fiscal nine months ended Dec. 31, Taft had a net loss of $46.5 million, compared with earnings of $33.2 million, or $3.61 a share, a year earlier. The latest nine-month figures include third-quarter losses of $57.1 million related to the sale of the five TV stations. Nine-month revenue increased 11% to $403.4 million.    Under terms of the offer, the Taft family and Narragansett would own the company with the family -- with Dudley Taft in charge -- running the operation. That would return Mr. Taft to a position of leadership from which he has slowly been pushed by the board. In July, the 46-year-old Mr. Taft was named vice chairman after serving as president and chief operating officer for more than 10 years. The move was said to have been forced by the Bass group, which has four seats on the Taft board.    Jonathan M. Nelson, a Narragansett general partner and managing director, described the proposed transaction as a &quot;fully leveraged buyout,&quot; where the Narraganset/Taft group will put in $125 million in cash and Taft common stock and fund the remainder with the proceeds of high-yeild securities, known as junk bonds, and bank debt. In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company largely with debt that ultimately is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company. Mr. Nelson indicated that the proposed transaction between Narragansett and Mr. Taft has been in the works for six months.    Mr. Nelson wouldn't indicate whether his group would sweeten its bid, saying only that the $145-a-share price &quot;is a fair one and reflects the value of the company.&quot;    If the transaction, which is subject to the approval of the Taft board, goes through, the Narragansett/Taft group said it intends to keep the company headquartered in Cincinnati and position it for future growth in the broadcasting business. Mr. Taft indicated that the new company might buy additional radio and television stations.    It is unclear how much influence Taft management -- apart from Mr. Taft -- have over the board and whether they favor the move to sell the company. Charles Mechem, Jr., Taft's chairman and chief executive officer, and George Castrucci, the chief operating officer, are not major shareholders.    The Narragansett/Taft group, which is being advised by the investment banking firm of First Boston Corp., said it's &quot;highly confident&quot; that financing for the acquisition can be arranged. Mr. Nelson said Narragansett/Taft also is raising $700 million to pay off long-term debt incurred in 1985 when Taft acquired seven radio stations and five television stations from Dallas-based Gulf andamp; Western Co.    Narragansett is somewhat new to the leveraged buyout game. It was formed late last year, after the assets of a predecessor company, the venture capital firm of Narragansett Capital Corp., was sold to Monarch Capital Corp., Springfield, Mass. The new company manages several investment funds with combined assets of more than $400 million. The company recently purchased a television station in Sacramento, Calif., as well as several radio stations and cable properties. </TEXT></DOC>
