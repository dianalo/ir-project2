WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Paul Manafort, a Republican consultant withties to Presidents Bush and Reagan, told a House panel today he``played by the rules'' in obtaining lucrative, multimillion-dollarfederal housing subsidies.   Manafort came under sharp and hostile questioning today in hissecond appearance before the House Government Operationssubcommittee on employment and housing, the panel that has beeninvestigating influence-peddling and mismanagement at theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.   Manafort, a former campaign adviser to Bush and ex-PresidentReagan and a former business partner of Republican NationalCommittee Chairman Lee Atwater, failed to recall all the HUDprojects he was involved in when he appeared before the same panellast June, and later sent two letters recounting additionalprojects.   He told the subcommittee today that he and others at hislobbying firm _ Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly _ had failed tofully check all of the firm's records and had initially overlookedsome projets, but not had disclosed them all.   He underwent extensive quetioning about a New Jersey housingproject which he purchased, with other partners, after firstobtaining commitments from HUD for more than $31 million inrenovation subsidies and tax credits.   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the panel, pressedManafort for details of the deal and suggested that Manafort andhis partners enjoyed an inside line to HUD officials and benefittedfrom HUD specifications that were written to exclude otherdevelopers.   ``It was a tailor-made award,'' Lantos said.   Manafort, however, said his firm ``has worked within theexisting system at HUD.''   ``We played by the rules,'' Manafort said. ``I understand thatthe subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed. I amnot here to argue with the subcommittee about the process, or todefend it ....''   Lantos said subcommittee staffers inspected the Seabrook housingproject in Upper Deerfield, N.J., last week and found conditions``shocking'' and ``a slum.'' He said one mother had no refrigeratorin her apartment, which rented with federal subsidies for $700 amonth.   Manafort said the project was still under renovation andasserted, ``When we are finished with construction, we believe thetenants will be happy.''   Also scheduled to testify were two employees of Manafort's firm,Richard Davis, a veteran of the Reagan White House, and LawrenceGay, whom Manafort said had met with Deborah Gore Dean when she wasexecutive assistant to then-Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.   Also appearing was Victor Cruse, a partner with Manafort in theSeabrook housing project in New Jersey.   In previous testimony before the subcommittee, some localofficials have said they opposed the New Jersey project whichManafort won subsidies for.   ``It's a very peculiar case of influence-peddling,'' Lantos said.   Testifying in June, Manafort acknowledged that his work on thatproject amounted to influence-peddling.   Manafort said his Alexandria, Va., lobbying firm of Black,Manafort, Stone andamp; Kelly did relatively little HUD business. But infollowing weeks, the firm's involvement with developers on projectsin New Jersey, Connecticut, Georgia and Puerto Rico came to light.   ``Manafort said that basically was it,'' said Stuart Weisberg,the subcommittee's staff director. ``Then we got two letters ofclarification.''   Manafort's two letters to the panel following his initialappearance detailed more business _ and one of the letters cameafter a New York Times report revealed a Connecticut project hehadn't mentioned.   ``He missed so much that if it were a college exam, he wouldhave failed it,'' Weisberg said then.   Pierce last week followed Dean in refusing to testify before theHouse subcommittee, citing his Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination and charging he had been ``prejudged'' by thepanel.   Two other former HUD officials _ Dean's predecessor as executiveassistant, Lance Wilson, and former deputy secretary Hunter Cushing_ have also refused to testify before the subcommittee.   Despite their refusal, the subcommittee has not moved to offerimmunity from prosecution to any witnesses as a way to break theimpasse. Weisberg said the refusal ``just means more work for us''and that the panel will use other witnesses to shed light on theactivity of the HUD higher-ups.   Most panel members have stopped short of calling for a specialprosecutor to be named to investigate Pierce and are awaiting hissecond subpoenaed appearance in late October to see if he willchange his mind.   ``I believe he has a moral obligation, having served assecretary of an important federal agency, to tell the Americanpeople about his activities,'' Lantos said. ``I very much hopeSecretary Pierce will testify.''</TEXT></DOC>
