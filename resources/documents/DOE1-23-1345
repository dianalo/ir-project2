As for the problem of connecting system with electric power system,by connecting and operating 7 small systems of 2.5 KW to the experimentaldistribution line, the effects which were given to the electric powerquality of the distribution line were resolved and protection and safeguardmethods have been investigated. The effectiveness of the suppressioncountermeasure to the harmonics of the inverter of harmonic PWN type,the problems of voltage variation of low and high voltage distributionlines, troubles of short circuit and grounding in high and low voltagedistribution line and the problems of stopping for works etc. have beenresolved. (2). As for the investigation of the adaptive system figure,by adding Pmax persuiting function to the direct current constant voltagecontrol system of the beforementioned 7 systems and changing the operatingsystem, the characteristic data of the power generation operation havebeen collected and analyzed. The reliabilities of the amorphous solarcells installed in 1983-1984 have been measured and evaluated and datahave been obtained. By 2 years operation, the degradation of 25-40% havebeen recognized. Also the actual design of the practical small photogenerating system equipped with elements detecting over and low voltageand abnormal frequency in system which is a sine wave PWM type withoutdegradation of the quality of system electric power and detects systemdisorder surely, have been done.
