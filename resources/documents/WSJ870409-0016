Usually, such plans are given to top management in order to discourage potential acquirers by requiring rich severance payments in the event of a change of control of the company.    But First City, which has been hit by the departure of four key managers since late last year, has a different purpose. The bank holding company posted a $402 million loss for 1986 and has said that it is seeking an acquirer or a partner to boost its sagging level of capital. Moreover, the severance plans weren't awarded to First City's four highest-paid officers, including Senior Chairman J.A. Elkins Jr. and President and Chairman Daniel C. Arnold.    The intent of the severance contracts is &quot;to encourage certain key officers and employees to remain in the employ of First City,&quot; a First City spokesman said. He, however, denied that the plans are related to the recent departure of some officers, including its highly regarded treasurer, Robert D. McKnew.    First City's board has authorized the company to offer as many as 30 such severance packages, and thus far, the bank has entered into 25 of them, according to the proxy statement for the company's May 13 annual meeting. Those being offered plans are senior executives in the second tier of management.    The packages include lump-sum cash payments equal to 200% of the employee's base salary in the event of termination within two years of a change of control of the company. Change of control is defined as the acquisition of 30% or more of the company's voting control by any one person or group, or as a change in the majority of the board following a tender offer, merger or other business combination.    Management recruiting firms are known to be paying special attention to Texas banks, where job security has diminished because of economic problems and mergers.    For example, George Grosz, a longtime executive vice president and manager of the trust division for First City's lead bank, left the company at the end of 1986 after a recruiting firm approached him with an attractive offer from the Riggs National Bank of Washington D.C.    &quot;It's a field day for the search firms to find real good people in Texas and they're taking advantage of that situation,&quot; Mr. Grosz said in a recent interview. &quot;I don't have any specific examples of headhunters talking to other people at First City, but I wouldn't be surprised.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
