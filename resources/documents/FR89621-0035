The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program to which this noticeapplies are: Title_Commodity Loans and Purchases; Number 10.051, as setforth in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto this notice since the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service(ASCS) nor Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) are not required by 5 U.S.C.553 or any provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemakingwith respect to the subject matter of this notice. This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of the ExecutiveOrder 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State andlocal officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V,published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). The purpose of this notice is to affirm the determinations of the nationalmarketing quotas for the 1989 crops of fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured(types 22-23), dark air-cured, sun-cured, and cigar-filler and binder (types42-44 andamp; 53-55) tobacco which were announced by the Secretary on Marchl, 1989 and to set forth certain other determinations with respect to thesekinds of tobacco. On March 1, 1989 the Secretary also announced that areferendum would be conducted by mail with respect to sun-cured tobacco.During the period March 27-30, 1989, eligible sun-cured producers votedin a referendum to determine whether such producers disapprove marketingquotas for the 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92 marketing years for this tobacco.Of the producers voting, 100.0 percent favored marketing quotas for sun-curedtobacco. Accordingly, a quota for this kind is in effect for the 1989-90marketing year. In accordance with section 312(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of1938, as amended (the ``Act''), the Secretary of Agriculture is requiredto proclaim not later than March 1 of any marketing year with respect toany kind of tobacco, other than burley and flue-cured tobacco, a nationalmarketing quota for any such kind of tobacco for each of the next 3 marketingyears if such marketing year is the last year of three consecutive yearsfor which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect. Withrespect to sun-cured tobacco, the 1988-89 marketing year is the last yearof three such consecutive years. Accordingly, a marketing quota for sun-curedtobacco is proclaimed for each of the three marketing years beginning October1, 1989, October 1, 1990, and October 1, 1991. Sections 312 and 313 ofthe Act also provide that the Secretary shall announce the reserve supplylevel and the total supply of fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22-23),dark air-cured, Virginia sun-cured, and cigar-filler and binder (types42-44 andamp; 53-55) tobaccos for the marketing year beginning October 1,1988, and the amounts of the national marketing quotas, national acreageallotments, and national acreage factors for apportioning the nationalacreage allotments (less reserves) to old farms, and the amounts of thenational reserves and parts thereof available for (a) new farms and (b)making corrections and adjusting inequities in old farm allotments forfire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22-23), dark air-cured, Virginiasun-cured, cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 andamp; 53-55) tobaccos forthe 1989-90 marketing year. Section 312(b) of the Act provides, in part, that the amount of the nationalmarketing quota for a kind of tobacco is the total quantity of that kindof tobacco which may be marketed which will make available during suchmarketing year a supply of such tobacco equal to the reserve supply level.Since producers of these kinds of tobacco generally produce less than theirrespective national acreage allotments, it has been determined that a largerquota would be necessary to make available production equal to the reservesupply level. The amount of the national marketing quota so announced may,not later than the following March 1, be increased by not more than 20percent if the Secretary determines that such increase is necessary inorder to meet market demands or to avoid undue restriction of marketingsin adjusting the total supply to the reserve supply level. Section 301(B)(14)(B) of the Act defines ``reserve supply level'' as thenormal supply, plus 5 percent thereof, to insure a supply adequate to meetdomestic consumption and export needs in years of drought, flood, or otheradverse conditions, as well as in years of plenty. The ``normal supply''is defined in section 301(b)(10)(B) of the Act as a normal year's domesticconsumption and exports, plus 175 percent of a normal year's domestic useand 65 percent of a normal year's exports as an allowance for a normalyear's carryover. A ``normal year's domestic consumption'' is defined insection 301(b)(11)(B) of the Act as the average quantity produced and consumedin the United States during the 10 marketing years immediately precedingthe marketing year in which such consumption is determined, adjusted forcurrent trends in such consumption. A ``normal year's exports'' is defined in section 301(b)(12) of the Actas the average quantity produced in and exported from the United Statesduring the 10 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing yearin which such exports are determined, adjusted for current trends in suchexports.On January 24, 1989, a Notice of Proposed Determination was published (54FR 3503) in which interested persons were requested to comment with respectto these issues. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>Thirty-six written responses were received in response to the Notice ofProposed Determination. Some of these comments addressed the establishmentof quotas with respect to more than one kind of tobacco. A summary of thesecomments by kind of tobacco is as follows: <T3>Fire-cured (type 21) tobacco: </T3>One comment was received. It recommendedthat the marketing quotas established for this kind of tobacco be increased10 percent from the 1988 marketing year. <T3>Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco: </T3>Two comments were received.Both recommended that marketing quotas established for this kind of tobaccobe established at the same level which was applicable for the 1988 marketingyear. <T3>Fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco: </T3>Twenty-three comments were received.Recommendations ranged from no change in quota to 50 percent increase fromthe 1988 marketing quota. <T3>Dark air-cured tobacco: </T3>Thirteen comments were received. Thesecomments ranged from a recommendation of no change in the marketing quotato an increase of 50 percent from the 1988 marketing year. <T3>Cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 andamp; 53-55) tobacco: </T3>Tencomments were received. These comments ranged from a 30 percent increasein quota to a 60 percent increase in quota from the 1988 marketing year.Based upon a review of these comments and the latest available statisticsof the Federal Government, the following determinations have been made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fired-Cured (Type 21) Tobacco </ITAG>The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced inthe United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the UnitedStates during the 10 marketing years preceding the 1988-89 marketing yearwas approximately 2.2 million pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured(type 21) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the UnitedStates during the 10 marketing years preceding the 1988-89 marketing yearwas 2.8 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Domestic use has trendeddownward while exports have fluctuated erratically. Accordingly, a normalyear's domestic consumption has been determined to be 1.2 million poundsand a normal year,s exports have been determined to be 3.0 million pounds.Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the Actresults in a reserve supply level of 8.6 million pounds. Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (type 21) tobaccoheld on October 1, 1988, of 6.6 million pounds. The 1988 fire-cured (type21) tobacco crop is estimated to be 3.0 million pounds. Therefore, thetotal supply of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco for the 1988-89 marketingyear is 9.6 million pounds. During the 1988-89 marketing year, it is estimatedthat disappearance will total approximately 3.2 million pounds. By deductingthis disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 6.4 million poundsat the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year is obtained. The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryoveron October 1, 1989 is 2.2 million pounds. This represents the quantityof fire-cured (type 21) tobacco which may be marketed which will make availableduring such marketing year a supply equal to the reserve supply level.During the past 5 years, less than half of the announced national marketingquota has been produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a nationalmarketing quota of 4.97 million pounds is necessary to make available productionof 2.2 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the Act, ithas been further determined that the 1989-90 national. marketing quotamust be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid undue restriction ofmarketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1989-90marketing year of 5.96 million pounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the Act, the 1989-90 national marketingquota divided by the 1984-88 5-year national average yield of 1,232 poundsper acre results in a 1989 national acreage allotment of 4,837.66 acres.Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the Act, a national acreagefactor of 1.0 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment,less a national reserve of 15.0 acres, by the total of 1989 preliminaryfarm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflectthe factors specified in section 313(g) of the Act for apportioning thenational acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fire-Cured (Types 22-23) Tobacco </ITAG>The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco producedin the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the UnitedStates during the 10 years preceding the 1988-89 marketing year was approximately17.5 million pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured (types 22-23)tobacco produced in the United States and exported during the 10 marketingyears preceding the 1988-89 marketing year was 18.9 million pounds (farm-salesweight basis). Domestic use and exports have trended upward lately. Accordingly,a normal year's domestic consumption has been determined to be 21.0 millionpounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 20.7 millionpounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B)of the Act results in a reserve supply level of 96.6 million pounds. Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobaccoon October 1, 1988, of 82.2 million pounds. The 1988 fire-cured (types22-23) crop is estimated to be 24.0 million pounds. Therefore, the totalsupply of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco for the marketing year beginningOctober 1, 1988, is 106.2 million pounds. During the 1988-89 marketingyear, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 36.0million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply,a carryover of 70.2 million pounds at the beginning of the 1989-90 marketingyear is obtained. The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryoveron October 1, 1989 is 26.4 million pounds. This represents the quantityof fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco which may be marketed which will makeavailable during the 1989-90 marketing year a supply equal to the reservesupply level. During the past 5 years, about 95 percent of the announcednational marketing quota has been produced. Accordingly, it has been determinedthat a national marketing quota for the 1989-90 marketing year of 27.7million pounds is necessary to make available production of 26.4 millionpounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the Act, it has been furtherdetermined that the 1989-90 national marketing quota must be increasedby 10 percent in order to avoid undue restriction of marketings. This resultsin a national marketing quota for the 1989-90 marketing year of 30.5 millionpounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the Act, the national marketing quotafor the 1989-90 marketing year has been divided by the 1984-88, 5-yearnational average yield of 2,130 pounds per acre, to obtain a national acreageallotment of 14,319.25 acres, for the 1989-90 marketing year. Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the Act, a national acreagefactor of 1.2 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotmentfor the 1989-90 marketing year less a national reserve of 66 acres by thetotal of the 1989 preliminary farm acreage allotments. The preliminaryfarm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)of the Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the nationalreserve, to old farms. <ITAG tagnum="84">Dark Air-Cured Tobacco </ITAG>The yearly average quantity of dark air-cured tobacco produced in the UnitedStates which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States duringthe 10 years preceding the 1988-89 marketing year was approximately 12.5million pounds. The average annual quantity produced domestically and exportedduring this period was 2.0 million pounds (farm-sales weight basis). Domesticuse has trended upward while exports have been erratic. Accordingly, 13.1million pounds have been used as a normal year's domestic consumption and2.5 million pounds have been used as a normal year's exports. Applicationof the formula required by section 301(14)(B) of the Act results in a reservesupply level of 42.1 million pounds. Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of dark air-cured tobacco heldon October 1, 1988, of 40.9 million pounds. The 1988 dark air-cured cropis estimated to be 7.7 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply forthe market year beginning October 1, 1988, is 48.6 million pounds. Duringthe 1988-89 marketing year, it is estimated that disappearance will totalapproximately 14.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance fromthe total supply, a carryover of 34.6 million pounds at the beginning ofthe 1989-90 marketing year is obtained.The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryoveron October 1, 1989 is 7.5 million pounds. This represents the quantityof dark air-cured tobacco which may be marketed which will make availableduring such marketing year a supply equal to the reserve supply level.During the last 5 years, about 90 percent of the announced national marketingquota has been produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a nationalmarketing quota for the 1989-90 marketing year of 8.3 million pounds isnecessary to make available production of 7.5 million pounds. In accordancewith section 312(b) of the Act, it has been further determined that the1989-90 marketing quota must be increased by 10 percent in order to avoidundue restriction of marketings. This results in a national marketing quotafor the 1989-90 marketing year of 9.1 million pounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the Act, the 1989-90 national marketingquota, divided by the 1984-88, 5-year national average yield of 2,072 poundsper acre, results in a national acreage allotment of 4,391.89. Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the Act, a national acreagefactor of 1.1 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment,less a national reserve of 20.0 aeres, by the total of the 1989 preliminaryfarm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflectthe factors specified in section 313(g) for apportioning the national acreageallotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Virginia Sun-Cured Tobacco </ITAG>The yearly average quantity of Virginia sun-cured tobacco produced in theUnited States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United Statesduring the 10 marketing years preceding the 1988-89 marketing year wasapproximately 400 thousand pounds. The average annual quantity producedin the United States and exported during the same period was approximately140 thousand pounds (farm-sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exportshave shown a downward trend. Accordingly, a quantity of 202 thousand poundshas been determined to be a normal year's domestic consumption and a quantityof 134 thousand pounds has been determined to be a normal year's exports.Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the Actresults in a reserve supply level of 816 thousand pounds. Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of Virginia sun-cured tobaccoheld on October 1, 1988 of 829 thousand pounds. The 1988 Virginia sun-curedtobacco crop is estimated to be 110 thousand pounds. Therefore, the totalsupply of Virginia sun-cured tobacco for the 1988-89 marketing year is939 thousand pounds. During the 1988-89 marketing year, it is estimatedthat disappearance will total approximately 200 thousand pounds. By deductingthis disappearanee from the total supply, a carryover of 739 thousand poundsat the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year is obtained. The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryoveron October 1, 1989 is 77 thousand pounds. This represents the quantityof Virginia sun-cured tobacco which may be marketed which will make availableduring such marketing year a supply equal to the reserve supply level.During the last 5 years, less than one-fifth of the announced nationalmarketing quota has been produced. Accordingly, it has been determinedthat a national marketing quota of 404 thousand pounds is necessary tomake available production of 77 thousand pounds. Increasing the quota by20 percent in accordance with section 312(b) of the Act to 485 thousandpounds is necessary to avoid undue restriction of marketings. This resultsin a national marketing quota for the 1989-90 marketing year of 485 thousandpounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the Act, the 1989-90 national marketingquota divided by the 1984-88 5-year national average yield of 1,210 poundsper acre results in a 1989 national acreage allotment of 400.83 acres.Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the Act, a national acreagefactor of 1.0 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment,less a national reserve of 2.4 acres, by the total of the 1989 preliminaryfarm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflectthe factors specified in section 313(g) of the Act for apportioning thenational acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cigar-Filler and Binder (Types 42-44 andamp; 53-55) Tobacco </ITAG>The yearly average quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 andamp;53-55) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to havebeen consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1988-89marketing year was approximately 22.2 million pounds. The average annualquantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 andamp; 53-55) tobacco producedin the United States and exported from the United States during the 10marketing years preceding the 1988-89 marketing year was very small. Domesticuse has trended downward and exports are small. Accordingly, a normal year'sdomestic consumption has been established at 15.7 million pounds whilea normal year's exports has been established at .06 million pounds. Applicationof the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) the Act results in areserve supply level of 45.5 million pounds. Manufacturers and dealers report stocks of cigar-filler and binder (types42-44 andamp; 53-55) tobacco held on October 1, 1988 of 41.9 million pounds.The 1988 cigar-filler and binder crop is estimated to be 5.8 million pounds.Therefore, the total supply of cigar-filler and binder (types 42 44 andamp;53 55) tobacco for the 1988-89 marketing year is 47.7 million pounds. Duringthe 1988-89 marketing year, it is estimated that disappearance will totalabout 19.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the totalsupply, a carryover of 28.7 million pounds at the beginning of the 1989-90marketing year is obtained. The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryoveron October 1, 1989 is 16.8 million pounds. This represents the quantityof cigar-filler and binder tobacco which may be marketed which will makeavailable during such marketing year a supply equal to the reserve supplylevel. It is expected that approximately 75 percent of the announced nationalmarketing quota will be produced in the upcoming season. Accordingly, ithas been determined that a 1989-90 national marketing quota of 22.4 millionpounds is necessary to make available production of 16.8 million pounds.This results in a national marketing quota for the 1989-90 marketing yearof 22.4 million pounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the Act, the 1989-90 national marketingquota of 22.4 million pounds divided by the 1984-88 5-year national averageyield of 2,019 pounds per acre results in a 1989-90 national acreage allotmentof 11,094.60 acres. Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g), a national acreage factorof 1.4 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment, less anational reserve of 17 acres, by the total of the 1989 preliminary farmacreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect thefactors specified in section 313(g) for apportioning the national acreageallotment, less the national reserve, to old farms. Accordingly, the following determinations announced by the Secretary ofAgriculture on March 1, 1989 are affirmed: <ITAG tagnum="84">Proclamations of National Marketing Quotas for Virginia Sun-CuredTobacco </ITAG>Since the 1988-89 marketing year is the last of 3 consecutive years forwhich marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect for sun-curedtobacco, a national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco for each ofthe 3 marketing years beginning October 1, 1989, October 1, 1990, and October1, 1991 is proclaimed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations for the 1989-91 Marketing Years of Fire-Cured (Type21), Fire-Cured (Types 22-23), Dark Air-Cured, Virginia Sun-Cured, andCigar-Filler and Binder (Types 42-44 and 53-55) Tobacco   </ITAG>Referendum Results Marketing quotas shall be in effect for the 1989-90 marketing year forVirginia sun-cured tobacco.
