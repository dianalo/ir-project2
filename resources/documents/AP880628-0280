A rise in the benchmark lending rate, the fourth this month, wasexpected following a government report Monday of a sharply wider,record merchandise trade deficit, which sent the pound and theLondon stock market reeling.   The report, and the markets' reaction, fueled speculation thatthe government would push up interest rates to cool the economy'sgrowth, by discouraging consumer buying, and to counter inflation.   Some analysts had expected the central bank to go as far assignaling a one percentage point gain. Another half-point increasemight follow shortly, analysts said.   The central bank signaled the half-point increase at midday byraising a key money market intervention rate of its own.   Major banks, such as Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC,National Westminster Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC, announced theywere increasing their rate. The banks also increased the baselending rate half a percentage point on June 2, June 6 and June 22.   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at a percentage point abovethe base rate.   Britain's merchandise trade deficit soared to a record 1.705billion pounds, or $2.9 billion, in May, with imports running attheir highest level since last summer, the government said in itsMonday report.   The pound, which plummeted 4 cents Monday to $1.7030 from$1.7430, was quoted at $1.7260 after the rate increases Tuesday.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was downaround 3 points at the 1,838 level by midday Tuesday. It fell 29.8points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,841.5 in the previous session.</TEXT></DOC>
