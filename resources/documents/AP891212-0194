Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the GATT, also said Mondaythat prospects were ``dim'' for reducing the current accountimbalances between major trading partners such as the UnitedStates, West Germany and Japan and that trade-restricting domesticpolicies remained widespread.   In the Overview of Developments in the International TradingEnvironment, Dunkel said there had been much progress towards tradeliberalization since the current Uruguay Round of tradenegotiations began in 1986, but protectionist pressures continued.   Dunkel urged countries not to use unilateral or bilateralmeasures to settle trade disputes pending agreement on new, morecomprehensive international rules by next December when thefour-year Uruguay Round ends.   He warned that such action would jeopardize the success of thenegotiations.   Under terms of trade legislation enacted last year, the UnitedStates in May singled out Japan, Brazil and India as having theworst restrictions against U.S. exports and threatened retaliationif its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks.   The GATT report warned of continuing pressure by trade-deficitcountries to use protectionism or to press trading partners tochange their trading policies to help shrink the imbalances.   ``The problem is not just that such an approach could involvepolicy actions which would be inconsistent with the spirit _ if notthe letter _ of the General Agreement (on Tariffs and Trade), butthat these policies by themselves will be ineffective in bringingabout a lasting reduction in the imbalances,'' Dunkel stated.   The GATT director-general said that although many countries hadtaken steps to liberalize trade, policies to regulate importsremained widespread.   Dunkel cited the growing use of anti-dumping measures, wherebycountries try to prevent goods from being ``dumped'' their marketsat prices below those charged by the exporter in its own domesticmarket.   He said that after tariffs, anti-dumping legislation was themost frequently invoked trade policy instrument in manyindustrialized countries.   The 97 members of GATT, which sponsors trade liberalizingnegotiations and sets world trade rules, account for more than 80percent of international trade.   The GATT report said the United States was certain this year toagain become the world's leading exporter in dollar value,recapturing the position it lost to West Germany in 1986.   In the first three quarters of the year, U.S. merchandiseexports grew by 15 percent, more than double the dollar valueincrease recorded by Japan and West Germany, the report said.   However, the rate of expansion was down from 29 percent in 1988.Combined with a slight slackening of import growth from 9 percentto 8 percent, this meant the reduction in the U.S. trade deficitlost momentum, Dunkel said.   U.S. exports in the first nine months of the year were worthsome $271.3 billion, while the value of imports totalled $365.6billion, according to GATT figures.   The overall growth in world trade is likely to slacken nextyear, even though 1990 would still mark the eighth consecutive yearof expansion, the report stated.   Next year, the report predicted, the economies of West Europeannations were likely to grow by about 3 percent in output, averagefor the industrialized world, while growth in the United States,Canada and Britain was expected to fall below the average.   For 1989, world output and merchandise trade were expected toexpand in real terms by 3 percent and 7 percent respectively, thereport stated, marking the fourth straight year trade growth hadoutstripped production growth.   Last year international trade in goods grew by a record 8.5percent over 1987, according to GATT figures.</TEXT></DOC>
