Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR ECO CHM TRA MIN PUL ELE EDP CON IND ARO PHA BVG HHP RET </IN><TEXT>   The 1987 stock market was a heartstopper.    Stock prices soared as if they would never stop, then plunged with unprecedented speed. Investors' exhilaration quickly turned to fear.    &quot;We had five years of market activity compressed into one,&quot; said George London, head of stock management at Scudder Stevens andamp; Clark, a New York-based investment firm.    Many Wall Street professionals and individual investors still haven't recovered. Some look for a rebound in 1988 and suggest that industrial stocks in particular seem promising. But gone is the heady talk of the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 3600 in a matter of months. Many now expect it to trade between 1700 and 2200, a slightly wider band than it has covered since the crash. And these days, moving over 2000 probably would bring cheers. Caution is clearly the watchword.    &quot;Conservative is better than risky,&quot; said Edward Macheski, co-head of Macheski/Pappas Asset Management, a Wilton, Conn.-based investment firm.    Hardly a surprise, considering just how wild the rise and fall of last year's market really was. By the time the bull market marked its fifth anniversary in early August, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed nearly 42% on the year. The charge during the summer months was barely slowed by rising interest rates and a shrinking money supply --usually death blows for stock bulls.    But worries of a lower U.S. dollar and the ever-widening trade and budget deficits, as well as those higher rates, finally sobered up investors at home and abroad. These anxieties set off a wave of selling that strangled the bull market Oct. 19, when the industrial average plummeted a stunning 508.00 points. All the gains of 1987 were wiped out and then some. The 30-stock average of blue-chip stocks ended 1987 at 1938.83, up 42.88 points, or 2.2%.    Last year's crash created an uncertainty that makes this year's forecasts chancier than usual. Yet most analysts expect the course of the stock market in 1988 to be closely tied to the fortunes of the consumer and the manufacturer.    They're mostly cool to companies closely linked to consumers, reasoning that such businesses may feel a pinch as households spend less early this year. But they expect a capital spending boom to boost the industrial sector. So any slowdown &quot;isn't going to be seen in Peoria,&quot; said Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Rising exports are pulling on many U.S. industries in which capacity is already near peak levels. A Commerce Department survey in late December showed that businesses of all kinds expect to spend $419 billion on new plant and equipment this year, up from an estimated $390.6 billion in 1987. The 1988 forecast is 2.9% higher than 1986 capital spending.    &quot;While that's bullish for industrial stocks, it's bearish for just about everything else,&quot; Mr. Clough added. He explained that some of the spending increase will go for foreign goods, thus propping up imports, the curse of the U.S. trade deficit; credit demands would remain strong, not allowing interest rates to fall; and the Federal Reserve might not be able to continue an easy monetary policy if the economy picks up too much steam.    Analysts at Salomon Brothers are banking on this predicted industrial strength, advising clients to focus on basic-industry stocks, such as chemical, railroad, steel, paper and forest-products issues. They're also high on sectors that benefit from capital spending, such as electrical equipment, computers and high technology, engineering and construction, machinery and aerospace. The lower dollar should also provide a boost for these groups.    Some groups tied to manufacturing, such as steel, aluminum, miscellaneous metals, semiconductors and diversified machinery, were among the best performers of 1987.    &quot;The stock market doesn't have to take it all on the chin,&quot; said Francis Schott, chief economist at Equitable Assurance Co. He concedes that interest rates at current or possibly higher levels may not allow much room for stock-price gains, but the prospect of higher profits from industrial companies could still make for advancing issues.    Suresh Bhirud, a portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., has one of the more optimistic outlooks for 1988, seeing a chance for the industrial average to climb as high as 2500 this year because he doesn't see the threat of recession as very real.    He's advising clients to include some of the large multinationals and industrial stocks in their portfolios. But he's not avoiding consumer-oriented stocks such as drug, soft-drink, brewing, soap and some cosmetics issues. Mr. Bhirud sees these as companies that have steady earnings patterns regardless of what the economy is doing.    Ralph Tate, head of the stock investment division at Aetna Life Insurance Co. in Hartford, Conn., believes there are some attractive stocks even in the retailing group, the one area most managers want to avoid. He sees as buys those issues, such as K mart and J.C. Penney, that are selling below the market's price-earnings ratio and with good prospects for earnings growth and light inventory positions.    Financial-company stocks don't make many lists of potential 1988 winners. Following October's huge trading losses, brokerage firms' main revenue sources --selling new equity issues and arranging mergers --have dried up. The firms have slashed staffs and expenses, and formed hasty marriages to shore up depleted capital bases.    In another reflection of uncertain times, investment strategists are advising clients to keep some cash in their portfolios. Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Brothers believes 15% in short-term securities, where 6% yields are available, is wise. Eric Miller, a portfolio strategist at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette in New York, is a bit more cautious, advising a 20% cash position.    Until the crash last year, stock market bulls were placing their bets on the earnings power of newly streamlined American companies. Forecasts for double-digit profit growth abounded by midsummer. Big returns from stocks in four out of the past five years also sucked many new investors into the market, driving prices even higher.    Early in the year, foreign demand for U.S. equities, especially from the Japanese, exploded. Expectations that foreign investors would continue to be big buyers, regardless of price, added more fuel to the advance.    Portfolio insurance, a trading strategy that purported to shield investors from market declines, provided a false sense of security. The consequence, analysts say, is that many large institutions hung on to large equity positions that they might otherwise have sold.    The rampant speculation in small-capitalization emerging companies usually seen at the end of a bull market wasn't there. But takeover and restructuring candidates, and stock-index futures and options, provided brand new avenues for speculators.    &quot;People stopped taking about earnings growth and started talking about takeover values,&quot; recalled Douglas Loudon, head of stock management at Scudder Stevens andamp; Clark in New York.    As early as March, some market professionals who measure equity valuations against earnings, dividend yield, book value and interest rates, started to warn that stock prices had become way out of line. They feared that to bring these valuations back within their historical parameters, a wrenching price correction was very likely.    In late August, Robert Kirby, president of Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles, said that his 35 years in the stock market had taught him to allow a little for the madness of crowds. &quot;The only way you can capitalize on the flights of fancy that drive stocks to overvalued levels is to bend the rules&quot; of traditional stock evaluation.    With the benefit of hindsight, those valuation models were right after all. But these tools are really no help in timing a change in market direction. The slide of September and October took many professionals and individual investors alike by surprise.    ---           Foreigners' Appetite For U.S. Securities                     Net Foreign Purchases                   (In billions of dollars)               U.S.                    U.S.         TREASURIES              CORPORATES          U.S.         andamp; AGENCIES      (Incl.
