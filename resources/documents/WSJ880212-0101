The administration decision is a big boost for Houston-based Space Industries Inc., which plans to build a small space station to conduct experiments for industry and government.    National Aeronautics and Space Administration head James Fletcher said the agency will spend about $700 million over five years to lease space for the government on a commercial space station. The agency will award the contract in about five months.    Mr. Fletcher said NASA will ask bidders to compete to build the space station, but Space Industries clearly is in the lead to win the award. Mr. Fletcher said he didn't know of any other company that might bid.    The space station project is part of the administration's new space policy, approved by the president Jan. 5 and explained yesterday at a White House briefing.    The administration's decision marks the growing erosion of NASA's monopoly on space exploration. Mr. Fletcher, putting the best light on what is clearly a loss of power for the space agency, said the administration has committed itself to manned flights to the moon or Mars. But the administration didn't set a date for those flights or appropriate any money. Instead, NASA intends to spend $100 million next year on advanced space technology, which might someday lead to a renewal of manned flights.    &quot;There's a long-term goal -- some time in the next century -- to go back to the moon and establish a base or go on to Mars,&quot; Mr. Fletcher said.    For this century, however, the administration seems more interested in space commerce than conquest. &quot;Space is just a place to do business,&quot; said Commerce Secretary C. William Verity at the briefing.    Under the administration's new policy, NASA will rent out part of future shuttle payload areas to private companies and give away used shuttle fuel tanks to companies for use in research or manufacturing in space. In addition, the administration directed federal agencies to use private missile companies to launch satellites and other space cargo.    &quot;We now have the U.S. government sending very clear signals to the private sector that the government won't try to monopolize space,&quot; said Transportation Secretary James Burnley, who also was at the briefing.    The funding for the policy requires congressional approval, but the policy isn't expected to run into opposition.    Separately, NASA said it successfully tested its redesigned shuttle O-ring by allowing hot gases to sear it during a trial firing in Alabama. The faulty design of the O-ring was responsible for the 1986 Challenger disaster. </TEXT></DOC>
