Gorbachev has appealedpersonally to President Bush to help bring peace to Afghanistan nowthat the Red Army has withdrawn, a top Kremlin diplomat said Friday.   Both the diplomat and a Soviet general acknowleged at a newsconference that the Soviets are worried about continued bloodshed inAfghanistan, but rejected any parallels between their pullout andthe 1973 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam.   ``The Americans simply fled and abandoned everything when theyleft Vietnam,'' said Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, deputy defenseminister and chief of Soviet ground forces. ``We did not abandonanything. We were not in a rush.''   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, Soviet first deputy foreign minister,said an ``individual message'' from Gorbachev to Bush seeks U.S.backing for Kremlin suggestions on how to achieve a politicalsettlement in Afghanistan, including a halt in arms supplies to theU.S.-backed insurgents and the establishment of a broader-basedgovernment.   ``We are proposing that we assist in a cease-fire,'' saidBessmertnykh, referring to the joint superpower action sought byGorbachev. ``We consider that the United States and the Soviet Unioncan always play a positive role.''   In what appeared to be a wide-ranging Kremlin effort to preventthe violent overthrow of the pro-Moscow government of PresidentNajib, the Soviets also sent messages to France, Britain, WestGermany and Italy asking them to give humanitarian and economicassistance to Afghanistan, Bessmertnykh said.   Messages were also sent to China, Iran and Pakistan, which havegiven weapons and other support to the guerrillas.   Western diplomats and the insurgents have predicted Najib'sgovernment will fall soon now that the Soviets are gone. The last ofthe Red Army's 115,000 soldiers that had been stationed therereturned home Wednesday.   Bessmertnykh said the withdrawal had created an ``extraordinaryopportunity'' to end Afghanistan's nearly 11-year-old civil war,sparked by the April 1978 coup in which the Marxist People'sDemocratic Party of Afghanistan seized power. The Soviets sent tanksand troops in the following year.   ``We believe all countries should respond to the emergingopportunity to put an end to the drawn-out conflict by promoting thecomplete and fast settlement of the situation and the reinstatementof Afghanistan as a prosperous, strong, independent, neutral andnon-aligned nation,'' Bessmertnykh said.   The message to Bush from Gorbachev was delivered to the WhiteHouse on Friday by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, said Bush presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater. Bush, who was in St. Louis at the time,did not have a chance to read the full letter, Fitzwater said.   Fitzwater said the message from Gorbachev ``generally repeatstheir public position.''   Fitzwater said he did not want to be more specific about thecontents, although he noted the Soviet message did reiterate ``theirpublic positions about ending support for the rebels.''   ``We don't have a detailed response. We just received the letter.But our concerns remain the same,'' Fitzwater said.   Bush said Thursday he hoped the pullout would ensure ``no morebloodbaths'' in Afghanistan, but rejected a Kremlin call for animmediate cease-fire and an arms embargo.   He said he could not endorse those measures because he wasconcerned that the retreating Soviets might have left behind a``tremendous amount'' of weapons and ammunition for their Afghanallies.   According to U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman,there was a massive stockpiling of weapons in Afghanistan by theSoviets recently, and they handed over to Najib's forces fighteraircraft and helicopters, dozens of tanks, infantry fightingvehicles, armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers andhundreds of transport vehicles.   Bessmertnykh seemed at pains to put the best possible cast onBush's statements when he said the Soviets were encouraged by thepresident's omission of any mention of continued U.S. arms suppliesto the guerrillas.   He said the Soviets would like to take Bush's words ``at facevalue.''   Later Friday, a senior official on Secretary of State James A.Baker's plane said U.S. weapons shipments to Moslem guerrillas inAfghanistan will be continued even if the Soviet Union ceased itssupport for the Kabul government.   ``As long as the mujahedeen are fighting for the right ofself-determination, we should assist that effort,'' the officialsaid.   Bessmertnykh also did not repeat Kremlin charges the UnitedStates was violating the U.N.-brokered accords that led to theSoviet pullout by shipping weapons to the insurgents.   The departure of Soviet soldiers at a time of politicaluncertainty has led some in the West to see similarities with SouthVietnam, where communist forces seized power in 1975, three yearsafter the departure of the last U.S. combat troops.   ``There can be no parallels here,'' said Varennikov, whopreviously served as the representative of the Soviet militarycommand in Afghanistan. ``Now that Soviet troops have gone, we haveleft behind an integral and free state which is unfortunately stillengaged in a war against bands that are still aggressive.''   Varennikov also said 30 Soviet military advisers remain inAfghanistan under a bilateral Soviet-Afghan agreement.   ``These are mostly Soviet military experts who will providevarious kinds of needed assistance and ensure the landing of Sovietplanes bringing food and other goods to Afghanistan,'' Varennikovtold the Tass news agency. He said the advisers were not attached toAfghan military units, but to its government.</TEXT></DOC>
