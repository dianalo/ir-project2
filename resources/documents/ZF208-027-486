(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OCELOT2--The SQL!andM;When you go to see the sequel to a movie, you expect it to be a lot like theoriginal.andP;  When it comes to software, you've probably come to expect thattoo.andP;  Not so with OCELOT2--The SQL.andP;  The original OCELOT was a proprietarynon-SQL database manager developed for library cataloging and circulationapplications.andP;  OCELOT2 version 2.07, on the other hand, is an attractivelow-end SQL-based database manager with some surprising features.andM;What it isandM;OCELOT2 is a database manager with an interactive SQL interface (namedOCELOT), a simple report writer (REPORTER), and a precompiler for writing 3GLprograms with embedded SQL (PRECOMP)--all for just $99.95.andP;  BorlandInternational successfully pioneered the low-end programming language marketwith its powerful and inexpensive line of Turbo compilers.andP;  According toPeter Gulutzan, president of Ocelot Computer Services inc., OCELOT2 is aimedat developers in the low-end of the relational database market.andP;  In fact, itturns out that a large number of OCELOT2 buyers are Turbo C programmers.andO;Although there are no competing DOS SQL products in the $100 range, OCELOT2is, in functionality, much like products like dQUERY/Lib from QuadbaseSystems ($295) and XQL from Novell ($795).andM;Data definition and manipulationandM;OCELOT2 data definition and data manipulation language (DDL and DML) commandsare modeled after the SQL implementation of two IBM software products: OS/2Extended Edition Database Manager and DB2 (see Fig.andP;  1).andP;  OCELOT2 gets itsbuilt-in support for primary and foreign keys from DB2, making it one of thefew DOS products that manages referential integrity without programming.andM;OCELOT2 doesn't stop there.andP;  It also feature SQL extensions that aren't foundin either of IBM's products.andP;  For example, OCELOT2's ROWIDs are unique rowidentifiers built into each table.andP;  ROWIDs can be queried but not set.andO;(ORACLE has a similar function, als called ROWID, that returns a differentstyle of identifier than OCELOT2).andP;  Another extension is the way OCELOT2imports and exports data between database and ASCII files.andP;  Importingcomma-delimited ASCII files is built into the INSERT statement with a FILEclauses:andM;INSERT INTO s FILE s.del;andM;Exporting is built into the SELECT statement with a FILE clause:andM;SELECT FILE lasup.dat s#, sname FROM s WHERE city = &quot;Los Angeles&quot;;andM;A formless productandM;What you don't get with OCELOT2 is a tool for building forms.andP;  In otherrelational database managers, like ORACLE or R:BASE, the forms system is thetool often used the most by developers, at least while prototyping (torapidly build and test the user interface).andP;  Gulutzan says that mostprogrammers who buy OCELOT2 already use a screen I/O library (like C-Worthyor Vitamin C), so that function isn't needed.andP;  If you purchase OCELOT2,you'll need to buy some other software to manage the screen.andM;But it has integrityandM;As I mentioned earlier, OCELOT2 supports referential integrity without makingyou write code.andP;  Two quotations from the manual explain its approach tointegrity:andM;&quot;There are two integrity rules that apply to all relational databases.andP;  Theentity integrity rule states that every row of a table must contain a primarykey with a unique, non-null value, to guarantee acess to every row.andP;  Thereferential integrity rule states that columns which are logically the sameas a primary key (its foreign keys) may contain only values that exist in theprimary key, or the null value.&quot;andM;&quot;In order to maintain referential integrity, and attempt to INSERT or UPDATEa value in a foreign key will be rejected if the new value does not exist inthe referenced primary key.andP;  Any attempt to DELETE or UPDATE a value in aprimary key which would leave a foreign key with unmatched values will alsobe rejected.&quot;andM;Here's an example of showing how to declare primary and foreign keysandM;Although this approach to referentail integrity is based on IBM's DB2,OCELOT2 doesn't support all of the integrity options that DB2 offers.andP;  What'sdescribed above, regarding attempts to delete a primary key value, is knownin DB2 as ON DELETE RESTRICT.andP;  DB2 delete options for foreign keys arespecified with ON DELETE CASCADE (i.e.andP;  delete all rows whose foreign keymatches the primary key) and ON DELETE SET NULL (i.e.andP;  set foreign keys thatmatch the primary key to null).andP;  Both of these options are useful and,according to Gulutzan, will be supported in a future version of OCELOT2.andM;OCELOT2's support for referential integrity is particularly remarkablebecause it's missing from most other PC SQL products.andP;  The Microsoft/Tate SQLServer pays lip service to referential integrity by allowing developers towrite &quot;triggers,&quot; a special type of stored SQL procedure that's executedautomatically when a database table is modified.andP;  If carefully written, SQLServer triggers can do all of the functions of DB2 primary and foreign keys,but with much more coding.andP;  The basis difference is: In DB2 (and OCELOT2)referential integrity is handled in the DDL, whereas in SQL Server and mostother SQL products, referential integrity is handled in the DML--if at all.andM;Embedded SQLandM;OCELOT2 offers embedded SQL to programmers using Microsoft C 5.0, MicrosoftQuickBASIC 3, 4, and 4.5, and Borland Turbo C 1.5 and 2.0.andP;  C or BASIC sourcecode programs use SQL statements preceded by EXEC SQL and run through theprecompiler, PRECOMP, to convert the SQL statements to low-level OCELOT2function or subroutine calls with pseudo-code (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  After beingprecompiled, the converted source code programs are compiled as if theydidn't have embedded SQL and linked with the OCELOT2 DBMS library.andP;  Thesample precompiling and compliling I did on the Keyword demonstration program(including with OCELOT2) resulted in a 228K executable file (approximately220K of that is the DBMS library according to the manual).andM;PRECOMP has a /n switch that allows precompiling without converting the SQLstatements to pseudo-code.andP;  According to Gulutzan, the /n switch is forprogrammers who want to directly edit the precompiler output file to writetheir own low-level calls to the OCELOT2 database manager.andP;  In version 2.07of OCELOT2, there's an apparent bug in PRECOMP that causes precompiling Cprograms to fail when the/n switch is used.andP;  This isn't a problem for mostdevelopers since the vast majority will want to precompile to pseudo-code forexecution speed and reduced EXE file size.andM;REPORTERandM;REPORTER is a simple report writer written in BASIC with OCELOT2 embeddedSQL.andP;  It produces tabular reports, based on SQL queries, with page headings,page footings, and control breaks with optional counting and summingoperations (Fig.andP;  3).andP;  If you need more complex reports, you'll have to writethem in a 3GL.andM;Timing testsandM;I timed OCELOT2 using 10 SQL queries based on the suppliers-parts-projectsdatabase presented in An Introduction to Database Systems by C. J. Data(Addison-Wesley, 1986).andP;  The queries are described in detail in the April1989 &quot;Hands-On SQL&quot; column.andP;  The thrust of these timings is to get a generalfeeling for the speed of the product using both simple and complex SELECTstatements on a mediumsized database (8,320 rows in four tables).andP;  SinceOCELOT2 supports tablespaces similar to those in DB2, I tested both thedefault case (all tables in a single tablespace) and a case with multipletablespaces (each table in a separate tablespace).andP;  The results of the timingtests are shown below.andP;  (If you aren't familiar with tablespaces orindexspaces, they specify the file that the table is stored in.andP;  If you don'tspecify a tablespace or indexspace, the table is stored in the defaulttablespace.andP;  If you store the table in an indexspace, the table is stored ina B-tree with all the index restrictions.)andM;As you can see, OCELOT2 was slower than ORACLE in most cases when a singletablespace was used (the two products tied in the single row indexed search,and OCELOT2 was faster than ORACLE in the two table join and the SELECT withmultiple nested sub-queries).andP;  When individual tables were stored in separatetablespaces, OCELOT2 pulled even with ORACLE (each product had four wins andthere were two ties).andP;  This suggests that there are significant performancegains in using separate tablespaces, but you'll have to test your querieswith OCELOT2 to be sure.andP;  Gulutzan points out that since tablespaces arestored in disk files, it's possible that separate tablespaces could slowthings down for queries that use a large number of tables.andP;  The documentationdoesn't discuss the performance issues--that would be a valuable addition.andM;Creating the database for the timing tests was simple with OCELOT2.231K inASCII data files begat 373K in database files (using a single tablespace forall tables and a single indexspace for all indexes).andP;  Using separatetablespaces shrunk the size of the database files to 265K.andP;  This shows thatyou can gain both performance and storage space using individual tablespaces.andM;DocumentationandM;The documentation is meager (a 22-page tutorial and a 218-page referencemanual), but what's there is well written and the examples are veryunderstandable.andP;  This is one of the few times i've actually read all of thedocumentation for a product before sitting down at the keyboard and using it.andM;ConclusionandM;Ocelot Computer Services offers programmers excellent value for their money.andO;OCELOT2 is a tool for programmers only--it's not designed for end users.andP;  Itsupports referential integrity, unlike most PC SQL database managers.andP;  Theoverall performance of OCELOT2 is in the ballpark with industry leaders(although it requires attention to data definition to coax the best resultsout of queries).andP;  For developers who want to use or learn SQL but arenhtwilling to pay the high prices of other SQL vendors, OCELOT2 is an attractiveand inexpensive way to go.andM;AvailabilityandM;OCELOT2--The SQL sells for $99.95.andP;  At the time of this review, a multiuserversion was available for an introductory price of $425.andP;  There are plans tointroduce a UNIX version in the future.andP;  Ocelot Computer Services Inc., islocated at 10025-106 Street, #1502, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T5J 1G7, phone(403) 421-4187.andM;Steve Roti is the owner of Olympic Software, a database applicationsconsulting firm located in Portland, Oregon.andP;  He has worked with SQL DBMSs onMS-DOS, Macintosh, VAX/VMS, and UNIX.andP;  His MCI mail address is SROTI.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
