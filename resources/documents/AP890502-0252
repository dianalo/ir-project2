Company officials said Monday that smoking will no longer beallowed in any of its buildings, nor at sites it rents for employeemeetings.   The policy is designed to protect the health of its 57,500 phonecompany employees in 14 western states, as well as eliminate thecost of providing smoking lounges, company officials said.   At the same time, U S West is offering to reimburse employees upto $150 if they enroll in programs to end smoking.   About 26 percent of the company's employees smoke, said U S Westspokeswoman Debbie Thomas.   U S West Communications _ the telephone services unit of U SWest Inc. of Englewood _ employes nearly 12,000 workers inColorado, including some 9,800 in the Denver metropolitan areaalone.   Besides company facilities in Colorado, the ban went into effectMonday at locations in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexicoand Arizona. Smoking already was prohibited at company sites in theseven other states where U.S. West operates.   ``The bottom line is there's so much evidence that secondarysmoke is harmful to those who don't smoke that this is the way togo,'' Thomas said.   The ban drew immediate criticism from the Communications Workersof America. A spokesman said the ban could become an issue in talkson a new labor contract, scheduled to begin next month.   Mark Belkin, a spokesman for Communications Workers of AmericaLocal 7777, which represents 6,500 U S West workers, is concernedthe ban will be enforced unequally between hourly workers andcorporate officers.   ``We hope to monitor the situation to make sure the companyenforced things in an equitable fashion,'' Belkin said. ``Thequestion is whether they're concerned about productivity or whetherit's a means to control people's individual choices.''   All the corporate concern failed to convince die-hard smokers ofthe danger.   Clustered in twos and threes Monday, sitting outside thedowntown Denver building Monday, a contingent of employees grabbeda puff.   ``I like to smoke, and I'll quit when I want to, not because ofsome rule,'' said Jan Charles, a 16-year employee of the phonecompany and a 17-year smoker.</TEXT></DOC>
