But the counteroffensive might not be enough to ward offdemonstrations by Russian workers angered by high prices andempty store shelves, or to protect Mr. Yeltsin's economicadvisers, whose heads the critics are demanding. Even Mr.Yeltsin's position is threatened by the public unrest.</LP><TEXT>   Speaking to Russia's parliament, Mr. Yeltsin answeredcriticism of his policies by promising to reconsider aspectsof the reform plan, especially social programs. Mr. Yeltsin'sdetractors haven't aimed their criticism directly at thestill-popular president. Instead, they have targeted Mr.Yeltsin's team of economic advisers, headed by Yegor Gaidar.   Earlier this week, parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov,a Yeltsin ally, called for the resignation of the entireYeltsin administration. And yesterday, during the livelyparliamentary session, he and others stepped up their attackson the Yeltsin government.   &quot;The state dominates everything and people live lower thanpoverty,&quot; said Ilya Konstantinov, a deputy from St.Petersburg. &quot;The reforms the Russian government is trying tocarry out will meet with a crashing disaster.&quot;   But by day's end, a fragile truce emerged, and VicePremier Gennady Burbulis even called the parliamentarycriticism &quot;constructive.&quot; But if disagreements worsen,political infighting could imperil Russia's transition to amarket economy -- and Mr. Yeltsin's power.   For the past week, in several cities, the Russianpresident has been confronted by crowds of shoppers irateover high prices. But Mr. Yeltsin contends that aconsumer-oriented market is beginning to emerge and thatprices have begun to descend in some areas.   The sharp popular reaction to the first two weeks ofso-called free prices is compelling Mr. Yeltsin and hisadvisers to revise their economic blueprint. Mr. Yeltsinadmitted that higher prices won't translate into more goodsunless state monopolies are dissolved. He pledged to speedprivatization of state-owned enterprises and property, whichis nearly everything in Russia.   Basic food items have begun to reappear in stores but atprices unaffordable to millions of Russians on fixed incomes.Mr. Yeltsin promised to increase their monthly payments andannounced that former Communist Party funds, including $17million in hard currency, would be used to improve socialwelfare programs.   The assurances may not be enough to prevent nationwidedemonstrations against &quot;robber prices,&quot; as they were calledthis week by the Federation of Independent Trade Unions.Before yesterday's parliamentary session began, 30 unionsfrom Moscow and central Russia blocked goverment buildings inthe center of Moscow.   Mr. Yeltsin's revisions also failed to ward off criticismof his advisers, who were left to field caustic remarks afterthe president ended his speech. So far, Mr. Yeltsin'sadvisers have responded with silence. But many feel that theGaidar team's days are probably numbered, as they were theones who implemented the onerous reforms.   &quot;It's like they're part of a deep military operation,&quot;said deputy Sergei Yushenkov. &quot;They're the first echelonthat's gone in to take the point and they'll perish doingso.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Once-Proud Soviet Force Is Bracingfor a Split On Nationalistic Lines&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 17, 1992)</TEXT></DOC>
