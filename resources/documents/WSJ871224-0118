No, it's not the seasonal dread of fruitcake, but it does get worse this time of year. I'm scared of revolving doors.    There, I said it. I've been holding my peace for more than a year now -- ever since I moved to New York from the South, where there is a blessed dearth of these menacing whirligigs.    This scarcity is no doubt due to the temperate climate. But up here, where the weather pounds harder at the door, having it revolve has become almost chic. It seems to be the in (and out) thing to do.    Which is just my predicament. I must trundle through no less than three of these whirling gateways on my trip to work each day. I live in continual fear of being pinched by some overzealous company man (or woman) rushing in the opposite direction. And the Christmas shopping carnival only makes the merry-go-round worse. I must resemble a drunken ostrich while adjusting my stride to avoid arbitrary amputation in what looks too much like a food processor for people.    Many times it's been literally nip and tuck: tuck in my backside or get it nipped off. On especially busy days, the doors seem set on automatic spin cycle -- which is always two gears above my wearisome pre- and post-work temperament.    And, much to my dismay, revolving doors seem to explain why chivalry is moribund. Have you ever tried to open a revolving door for a lady? I have. It went like this: &quot;Here, let me get the door for you. I mean, uh, let me push.&quot; Somehow I can't picture Rhett Butler pushing.    What's more, they're made of glass. I know this news isn't earth-shattering, but it means all my circumvolving tribulations are exposed to the curious masses. Consider the resemblance to a rotating fish bowl the next time you revolve. I figured out the reasoning behind this transparency, though. It's not just for viewing. It's for timing -- so pedestrians can see the guy coming the other way (me) and get a better shot at chopping his nose off. Hence, more of my nip-and-tuck maneuvers.    When my ornithic efforts fail, however, I can't accost the perpetrator without retraversing the very agent of aggression. It hardly seems worth it. However, if I accidently (of course) discomfort someone, an apology is also scarcely worth the effort. (As they say, what goes around comes around.) And the door prevents me from hearing my victim's kind words. You see, revolving doors work both ways.    But they don't swing both ways, at least not easily. I tell you this so you won't have to learn it the way I did, embarrassingly -- trapped like a bug in a jar. My fellow perambulists were utterly philanthropic with their &quot;must-be-a-tourist&quot; stares.    Nevertheless, I have discovered the inherent value in these spinnable portals -- besides keeping the cold out and the warm in, or vice versa. (Which, by the way, still doesn't explain revolving doors inside buildings.) Revolving doors are great Nautilus machines. They make up a ubiquitous exercise program. (Next they'll run the escalators backward in the name of fitness.) Thank God I can rest on the elevator.    Unfortunately, revolving doors come in differing speeds and strengths. Although they all may look similar, some spin like pinwheels, and some like biplane props. I always seem to get the He-Man model.    No matter how fast I whirl it, though, the guy behind me wants to crank up the RPMs. I hustle then, lest I get thwup, thwup, thwupped. (And would-be revolvers who get thwupped follow Ixion's fate, as mythology buffs know.)    Which leads to my evolutionary theory for revolving doors. The way I see it, revolving doors are agents of a rotational survival of the fittest. And, apparently, I'm not as fit as I could be, a fact that only heightens my revolvaphobia.    At least my biggest fear hasn't been realized -- revolving-door music: &quot;To everything (turn, turn, turn) . . .&quot;    ---   Mr. Hayden works at the Dow Jones News Service. </TEXT></DOC>
