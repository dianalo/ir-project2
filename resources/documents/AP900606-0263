The Hitachi M-880 Processor family, to be released Friday, will``allow us to catch up with IBM, and has increased ourcompetitiveness,'' Hitachi Vice President Takeo Miura told reporters.   He said the new generation computers will use about 20 percentless power and take up about half the space of the latest processorfamily developed by International Business Machines Corp.   Hitachi, however, was not expected to ship the new models inJapan until the fall and in the United States until the secondquarter of 1991, about the same time IBM was expected to have itslatest mainframe ready, said Don Young, an analyst for Sanford C.Bernstein in New York.   With IBM's next generation still an unknown quantity, ``I thinkwhat we've got here is apples and oranges. Apples is Hitachi todayand oranges is IBM tomorrow,'' Young said.   He added, however, that the announcement ``really makes (Hitachi)an incredible player in this market and puts them into the range ofcompeting with IBM.''   Hitachi said monthly lease charges on its new mainframes wouldrange from $512,450 to $1.02 million, about 10 percent to 15 percentbetter than the pricing currently offered by IBM.   ``I would surprised if we don't see a 10 to 15 percent priceimprovement from IBM'' next year, Young said.   Such general-purpose computers are mainly used for informationmanagement systems in large corporations.   IBM currently controls more than 70 percent of the U.S. mainframemarket; Amdahl Corp. is No. 2 with 10 percent to 15 percent andHitachi is a distant third with about of half of Amdahl's share,Young said. In Japan, Hitachi also lags behind IBM and Fujitsu Ltd.   The four new Hitachi models were developed in response tocustomer demand for faster, more powerful computers, Miura said. Allare IBM-compatible, he said.   The top-of-the-line M-880-420 is capable of performing at 155million instructions a second, compared to 88 for Hitachi's currenthigh-end model and 122 for IBM's top-line model, the 3090 600J, thecompany said.   This is the first time Hitachi has beaten IBM and othercompetitors such as Fujitsu and Amdahl to a new-generation releasein the mainframe market.</TEXT></DOC>
