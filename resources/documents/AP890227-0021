Since Jan. 7, bombings have injured 10 people, three U.S.soldiers have been wounded in attacks on American troops, and threepeople have been assassinated.   Honduran officials, however, are quick to point out that thelevel of violence remains low by Central American standards.   ``We are not in the middle of a communal war,'' said PresidentJose Azcona Hoyo in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Healthand education are more serious problems than violence.''   But four bombings since Feb. 18 prompted the chief of the armedforces, Gen. Humberto Regalado, to announce Thursday increasedinternal security and vigilance at public buildings.   Americans are ``briefed to keep a reasonable profile and becautious in their daily lives,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman CharlesBarclay. He said the instructions had not changed since shots werefired at a military convoy on Feb. 1 and a bomb was tossed at a busFeb. 18.   About 1,200 U.S. troops are stationed at Palmerola's EnriqueSotocano Air Base, and National Guard troops take part in frequentexercises. Honduras received about $1.15 billion in U.S. civil andmilitary aid from 1981 to 1988.   Set like a keystone between Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala,Honduras has frequently been involved in border problems andregional disputes, most recently by helping U.S.-supported Contrarebels trying to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government ofNicaragua.   ``Honduras has been the big loser in Central America,'' saidEfrain Diaz Arrivillaga, presidential candidate of the smallChristian Democratic party in elections set for Nov. 26.   Some of the violence can be pinned on leftist groups like theCinchonero guerrillas, but internal political disputes, drugtrafficking and Machiavellian revenge theories also circulate,creating an atmosphere of uncertainty.   No group has claimed responsibility for the most recent bombings.   Carlos Montoya, president of the Honduran Congress, said they``are related to conflicts of an internal order.''   He claimed the bombings are linked to drug trafficking and arecent police takeover at the Central Penitentiary, where guardswere accused of taking payoffs. He refused to elaborate.   The most significant killing, that of Gen. Gustavo AlvarezMartinez on Jan. 25, was thoroughly professional. He was blasted bysix gunmen who knew his routine, and the Cinchoneros promptlyclaimed responsibility.   Alvarez, head of the military from 1982 to 1984, played godfatherto the Contras. He was dumped by fellow officers and made anapparently genuine conversion to evangelical Christianity, carryinga Bible and refusing armed guards.   ``He was an extremist. Maybe he went to another extreme,'' saidDiaz.   Many Hondurans fear right-wing repression more than a revivedguerrilla force. In 1980-1984, when the Cinchonero PopularLiberation Movement was most active, more than 130 death squadkillings and disappearances were reported.   That is far fewer than the tens of thousands who have died in ElSalvador and Guatemala. But the specter of death squads caused analmost panicked reaction when the Alliance for Anticommunist Action_ Triple A _ distributed leaflets in late January threatening humanrights and labor and political leaders.   ``We hope that the response (to violence) is not repression,''said Felix Molina, an official of the Center for Human Rights.Molina claims Triple A is made up of army troops, but the militarydenies involvement.   ``There's no evidence the Triple A exists. They haven't actuallydone anything. The leaflets could be produced by anyone,'' saidRuben Zepeda, the nation's attorney general.   Honduras was once the prototypical banana republic, with bananasits leading export and revolving door governments _ it suffered 17coups or coup attempts in four years.   The nation of about 5 million is the poorest in Central America.Illiteracy is estimated at 46 percent, unemployment 25 percent,inflation 30 percent.   Border problems are historic.   When the Sandinistas were trying to topple Nicaraguan dictatorAnastasio Somoza, overthrown in 1979, many of their leaders lived inHonduras. In turn, the United States used Honduras to arm and trainthe Contras against the triumphant Sandinistas.   The Contras, operating from bases on the eastern border, provideda buffer with Nicaragua. But now that U.S. military aid to therebels has ended, Honduras finds itself playing host to anunemployed army of 11,000 and providing homes for an estimated140,000 refugees from the guerilla wars.   There also is trouble on the western border, where the leftistFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front is fighting the Salvadorangovernment. Angry Honduran officials say Salvadoran refugee campsare simply guerrilla training bases.   Street life in Tegucigalpa appears unaffected by the scatteredviolence. Young men and women stroll the city center into theevening.   There are classic signs of rural immigration and underemployment.Pregnant women sell food on the streets, young men sell trinkets,and beggars ask car owners to let them spend the night in theirautomobiles.   Murders increased 15 percent, to 177 last year, and Zepeda saidautomatic rifles, sold by penniless Contras for $300 to $400, areshowing up in the hands of ordinary criminals.   ``The people are scared, and with good reason,'' said the dailyEl Tiempo in an editorial. ``The assassinations are an unequivocalsign that we are in the shadow of what could quickly develop intomajor bloodshed, as happened in Guatemala and El Salvador.''</TEXT></DOC>
