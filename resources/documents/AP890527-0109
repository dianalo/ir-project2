In a surprise move, Kohl flew later to the Netherlands for talkswith Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers over the division in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization.   Lubbers has offered to mediate the dispute, in which WestGermany is trying to persuade the United States to agree to earlytalks with the Soviets on short-range atomic arsenals.   A government spokesman told The Associated Press Kohl's talkswith Lubbers were part of an earlier planned meeting with Holland'sgoverning Christian Democrats to discuss a number of topics. Butthere had been no announcement of Kohl's plans to confer withLubbers.   Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Nuremberg beforeleaving for the Netherlands, Kohl said superpower negotiations onthe short-range atomic arsenals ``cannot be postponed into thedistant future.''   ``We are the front-line country in NATO. It is clear that weshould be speaking up for our interests,'' Kohl said.   The United States, seeking to avert a NATO split, has reversed afirm stand against such negotiations and agreed to talks with theSoviets at an unspecified time on reducing the number ofshort-range nuclear weapons.   Also Saturday, Kohl's junior coalition partners made a veiledthreat to pull out of the government if the chancellor agreed tounacceptable compromises on the issue during NATO summit that opensMonday.   Kohl is caught between liberal elements within his coalition andconservatives who fear the internal feud endangers the Westernalliance.   Public opinion polls show most Germans want the Lance atomicrockets removed from German soil rather than modernized, as NATOadvocates.   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg reiterated West Germany'scall for U.S. talks with the Soviets on the issue, the Bildnewspaper reported. But it said Stoltenberg also noted West Germanycan't formulate European defense policy alone.   ``We must connect our interests to the clear goal of coming to acommon position within NATO through give and take,'' Soltenbergsaid in the interview to be published Sunday.   Bonn and Washington have tried to heal their rift over Kohl'scall for early talks on the short-range missiles. The United Statesand Britain say the talks should not occur while the Warsaw Pacthas superiority in conventional forces.   West German newspapers said Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher on Tuesday threatened to pull his minority Free DemocraticParty out of the governming coalition if Kohl softens his stand.   Members of the coalition are Kohl's Christian Democratic Union,its conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union,and the business-oriented Free Democrats.   Some members of Kohl's government, including Stoltenberg,reportedly have been angered by Genscher's aggressiveness in theNATO dispute. Newspaper reports said Stoltenberg noted Washingtonhas agreed in principle to start up negotiations on short-rangenuclear weapons and the question now is when those talks shouldbegin.</TEXT></DOC>
