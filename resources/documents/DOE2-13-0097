Diurnal peak surfacetemperature of 140 to 185{degree}F are not uncommon. The addition ofthermal mass to the exterior surface of the roof should lessen the severityof the environment that is experienced by the roof membrane and the roofinsulation. The exterior mass should result in attenuation both of temperatureextremes and of heat flux variations. It also may result in lowered netheat flow through the roof. This paper presents some results of a combinedexperimental and analytical study to quantify the effects of surfacemass. Measurements were made on roof test panels that were exposed tothe weather of eastern Tennessee. The test panels consisted of glassfiber insulation with a modified bitumen membrane. Experiments were conductedon a bare panel and on panels that were loaded with either concrete paversor aggregates. A heat transfer model for the bare panel and the panelwith concrete pavers was developed to calculate the internal temperaturesand heat fluxes using measured indoor and ambient conditions. The modelwas validated by comparing its predictions with measured values. Followingvalidation, the model was used to perform a parametric study of the effectsof various levels of surface mass. 5 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
