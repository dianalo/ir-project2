We followed the tracks and found themother and the baby in good health.''   Thirteen rhinoceroses have been transported to the Bardia reservesince 1986 from the Chitwan sanctuary, 220 dusty miles to the east,because naturalists feared it was too risky to leave the endangeredanimals in just one area where a single epidemic could wipe themout. The move was made with the assistance of the World WildlifeFund.   The reserve, 406 miles southwest of Katmandu, Nepal's capital, issimilar to Chitwan with its tropical lowland and thick highlandforest.   ``In the first year we took only four because we felttranslocating animals of this size was a logistics nightmare,'' saidHemant Raj Mishra, a noted Nepalese naturalist. ``It (thetranslocation) has never been done before in Asia.''   The rhinos previously had been found only in the Chitwan valley,75 miles southwest of Katmandu in Nepal's southern plains, and inKaziranga in the east Indian state of Assam. Kiziranga now has themost _ 1,000 to 1,200 _ of the one-horned rhinos, the second largestof the five species of rhinos.   Rhino horns remain in great demand in Asia and the Middle East,where they are carved into dagger handles or ground to dust to besold as an aphrodesiac. Consequently, wanton hunting and poachinghad depleted their number to about 100 in the Chitwan area.   In 1967, an aerial survey by the United Nations Food andAgriculture Organization estimated that only 90 to 108 rhionsremained in Chitwan, and only 5 percent of the females had calves _an indication their number was declining.   Nepalese officials implemented strict measures to protect theanimals, and their numbers increased to between 350 and 370 in 1986.Officials also found 70 percent of the females had calves, a sign ofhealthy growth in the population.   The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation, a non-profitorganization dedicated to preserving natural heritage of Nepal, hadconducted research works on the habit and habitat of rhinoceroses incollaboration with Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.   The American and Nepalese experts monitored individual rhino'smovement with radio collaring.   The people involved in the preparation of the ``operation rhino''to translocate the huge animals used dart guns with immobilizingdrugs to capture and cage them.   The cages then were lifted by a crane onto trucks. A drive ofmore than 20 hours took the convoy to the Bardia district.   When the trucks reached their destination, experts brought inelephants to make the rhinos feel at home.   When the cages were opened, however, the rhinos charged and theelephants fled.   ``Our elephants had never seen rhinos before,'' said a villager.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, Dec. 1</NOTE></DOC>
