The biggest boos are coming from farmers, who ended up on thelosing end of the dizzying drop in soybean prices precipitated bythe exchange's emergency order. Soybeans for July delivery settledFriday at $7.03{ a bushel, 22{ cents below the settlement price onTuesday before the exchange issued its directive, and 63 cents belowthe previous Friday's final price.   ``They feel they've been betrayed by the exchange,'' said JamesMerritt, research director for Merchants Trading Co., a Chicagofutures brokerage with a large farmer clientele.   Some of the Board of Trade's own members _ many of them purespeculators who make their living forecasting the movements of thefree market _ also feel cheated by the edict.   Regardless of whether the Italian concern Ferruzzi Finanziara SpAwas trying to corner the soybean market, critics say, directors ofthe exchange should have let the market sort itself out.   But the Board of Trade says that would have been even moretroublesome, that with too few soybeans of acceptable qualityavailable to satisfy outstanding contracts, there would have beendefaults and chaos in the marketplace.   The exchange says it is only doing its government-authorized jobof ensuring order in a market of global importance, therebyprotecting the public's interest. A federal judge in Chicago agreedon Thursday by denying Ferruzzi's bid to block the Board of Trade'sdirective.   ``If I grant a temporary restraining order in this case and itturns out to be a mistake ... a loss of confidence in the marketcould be a consequence,'' said U.S. District Judge James Zagel.   An investigation appears to be inevitable. And the century-olddebate revived by the flap _ whether agricultural futures marketsare legitimate marketing tools or gambling casinos _ will rage on.   That's nothing new for the Chicago Board of Trade. The 141-yearhistory of the world's oldest and largest futures exchange is strewnwith scandals, squeezes, corners and attempts to crush them.   When the dust clears, predicts Merton Miller, a University ofChicago finance professor and an expert on futures markets, theBoard of Trade will still be standing.   ``A lot of people may not like it but, as the saying goes, it'sthe only wheel in town,'' he said. ``If you're in the soybeanbusiness, what else are you going to do?''</TEXT><NOTE>Precious metals</NOTE><TEXT>   Gold futures prices, which had been climbing, got knocked backdown on Friday by a government reports indicating the economy isslowing down.
