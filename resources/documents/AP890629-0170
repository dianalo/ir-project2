Millie kept her silence.   Bush chuckled at questions from reporters seeking his response toan article in the July issue of ``Washingtonian Magazine'' entitled``Best and Worst'' and declaring: ``Our pick as ugliest dog: Millie,the White House mutt.''   ``Beautiful, beautiful, look at her,'' Bush exclaimed, pointingat the floppy-eared, brown-and-white pet cavorting at his feet afteran outdoor ceremony at the White House.   Mrs. Bush, however, had a sharper defense of the springer spaniel.   ``She'll get the last word. She'll get the last word, don't youworry,'' said Mrs. Bush, who noted earlier this week that sheplanned to ghostwrite a book ``by'' Millie, as she had done for aprevious dog, ``C. Fred.'' ``She's writing the book.''   Asked when the book was coming out, Mrs. Bush retorted: ``I don'tknow, but she's started now anyway.''   Would the book be about life in the White House?   ``I don't know. You have to ask her. Come here, Millie,'' calledMrs. Bush.   The pet springer spaniel dutifully trudged over to Mrs. Bush, whograbbed a boom mike _ a reporter's microphone on an extended pole _and placed it in front of the dog's face.   Millie seemed unimpressed.   ``You'll notice she's turning her back on the question,'' saidthe first lady.   It's not the first time the president and his wife have beencalled upon to defend Millie's honor since the magazine hit thenewsstands several days ago.   ``Imagine, picking on a guy's dog,'' Bush told interviewers fromthe Los Angeles Times on Wednesday. ``I know how Franklin Rooseveletfelt with the attack on (his dog) Fala.''   The Washingtonian article, subtitled ``The Annual Guide to What'sIn and What's Out,'' declared: ``Ugly Dog. Best: Millie, the WhiteHouse mutt. The first lady loves her, and she's a wonderful mother.She hasn't bitten the president during their showers together. Butlet's face it: This is a very homely springer spaniel.''</TEXT></DOC>
