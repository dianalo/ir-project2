Only eight days earlier, the helicopters affected _ 211 of the264 in the fleet _ had been cleared to fly after another fanproblem was fixed.   The fleet was grounded in August as a precaution while fanfailures were studied.   The Army's Aviation Systems Command and the manufacturer, BoeingHelicopter Co., determined that vibration most probably was causingthe fans to fail. The 211 machines that had not had failures weregiven the green light to fly again on Oct. 19, provided thatmodifications had been made, while studies continued on the 53whose fans had failed.   During inspection of the first craft to be modified, however, anew problem was found in the lubrication of the fan shaft spline,said the Army statement.   The St. Louis-based Aviation Systems Command and themanufacturer are now working on the lubrication problem in the 211newly grounded helicopters and will check the 53 that had not beencleared to fly, the Army said.</TEXT></DOC>
