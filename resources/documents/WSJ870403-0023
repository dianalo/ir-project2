Garcia</HL><DD> 04/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Neither the bulls nor the bears could get a firm grip on the stock market yesterday as stock prices edged higher in moderately active trading.    Oil-related issues rallied as oil prices firmed in the futures market. Japanese, steel, and technology stocks were also among the star performers of yesterday's session. However, International Business Machines wasn't among the technology stocks gaining ground.    IBM fell 3 1/8 to 148 on more than 2.3 million shares. Traders said the stock had run up in recent sessions in anticipation of IBM's new personal computer products. But many investors opted to take profits when the new products were finally unveiled yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 4.40 at 2320.45 after trading in a narrow range of about 25 points throughout the day.    The broader averages fared better than the blue-chip stocks. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.24 to 293.63 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.72 to 166.76. Advancing issues had a more than 9-to-6 lead over decliners on the Big Board.    Market activity was moderate as 182.9 million shares were traded, a shade more than the 182.6 million traded Wednesday.    Although the stock market has been able to recover about four-fifths of the ground it lost in Monday's dramatic plunge, investors remain nervous about the outlook for the dollar.    Stock prices sagged on news that U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that, in theory, a lower dollar would help narrow the U.S. trade deficit. Traders said stocks rebounded a bit when the White House said that Mr. Yeutter's views don't reflect the president's position.    Today's uemployment report for March should give the stock market a clue on how strong the economy was last month. Robert Barbera, chief economist at E.F. Hutton, said with investors' focus shifting to U.S. factory improvement and profits, the crucial part of the report will be what kind of increases were made in factory payrolls. He's looking for a gain of 220,000 to 240,000 jobs.    He added that the &quot;delicious part&quot; of the report is that improving factory activity could help shore up the dollar because &quot;it would suggest that something is turning around in our trade deficit.&quot;    Although the bond market tends to cheer lower economic activity because it means less credit demand, Mr. Barbera said &quot;even bond traders should be rooting for higher factory activity&quot; because it could help the dollar.    Mellon Bank tumbled 6 1/4 to 44 3/8 after announcing it plans to slash its dividend in half and expects to report a first-quarter loss between $55 million and $65 million. The loss stems partly from its accounting move in placing $310 million of loans to Brazil on a non-accrual basis.    Analysts and traders said halving the dividend was the most disconcerting news from Mellon because it reflects how deeply the credit problems run at the bank. However, analysts said the problems don't appear to be widespread in the banking industry.    James McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, observed that high credit losses in such inflation-sensitive sectors as energy and real-estate loans were coupled with a dramatic surge in non-performing assets, which puts a drag on the bank's earnings.    The stock price of some other banks that have placed their Brazil loans on nonaccural basis moved higher. They included J.P. Morgan, BankAmerica and Chemical.    Other technology issues prospered from IBM's new product announcements. Microsoft rose 4 to 95 in OTC trading.    Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said despite the general nervousness among investors, it was interesting how quickly many acted on buy recommendations. &quot;Obviously, there are still enormous piles of cash that still want&quot; to buy stocks, he added.    Occidental Petroleum rose 1 1/8 to 35 1/8 and Amerada Hess gained 1 1/8 to 34 in active trading. Dean Witter Reynolds issued short-term buy recommendations on the two issues. Other oil stocks were mostly higher.    Schlumberger added 1 3/8 to 43 on heavy volume and Bethlehem Steel jumped 1 1/8 to 11 on more than 2.1 million shares. Both stocks were recommended by Wall Street firms yesterday.    Amoco rose 2 3/8 to 84 1/8. The oil company said earnings are likely to improve this year even if oil prices remain at the same level as in 1986.    But investors appear equally quick to act on negative recommendations. American Express slid 2 3/8 to 72 after Salomon Brothers reportedly removed the stock from its buy list.    General Public Utilities eased 1/2 to 24 3/8. The Pennsylvania utility declared its first dividend on common stock since 1979 -- 15 cents a share, payable May 29 to stock of record April 24. The dividend was suspended after the nuclear accident at the company's Three Mile Island plant. Though dividend news is usually greeted by cheers from investors, the GPU announcement had been widely anticipated on Wall Street.    Pay 'N Pak Stores gained 1 3/4 to 20 1/2. Investor Paul Bilzerian, who controls a 9.9% stake in the company, is proposing to buy the rest of the common shares for $19 a share. His filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission didn't give any more details.    Revlon Group added 2 1/8 to 21 3/8 on heavy volume of more than 5.3 million shares. Although MacAndrews andamp; Forbes has launched an $18.50-a-share tender offer for the shares of Revlon it doesn't already own, there are continuing expectations that the bid might be raised.    Eli Lilly rose 2 1/4 to 95 3/4. The pharmaceutical concern said it's considering the sale of its Elizabeth Arden cosmetics unit and its board also approved a stock buyback of as many as 2.3 million shares.    Anheuser-Busch fell 5/8 to 32 3/8 in active trading. The company is being investigated by a federal grand jury in St. Louis to see whether outside suppliers made illegal kickbacks to former high-ranking Busch executives.    CPC International rose 1 1/8 to 51 1/8. The company said it has completed the sale of its South African subsidiary to a consortium of European and South African investors, ending CPC's operations in that country. </TEXT></DOC>
