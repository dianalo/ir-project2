In Parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned that Britain may use new financial legislation to limit Japan's presence in the City, London's financial district. And late Wednesday, 67 Conservative members of Parliament called for a parliamentary vote to cancel applications from additional Japanese financial institutions to operate in Britain.    The dispute has worsened since indications last week that Japan intends to limit foreign companies to stakes of 3% each in a new international telecommunications consortium planned for Japan. Cable andamp; Wireless PLC, a British telecommunications company, has been seeking a 20% share and a management role.    During a House of Commons question session yesterday, Mrs. Thatcher said the Cable andamp; Wireless issue was &quot;a test case of how open the Japanese market is.&quot; Under last year's Financial Services Act, which gradually takes effect this year, she added, &quot;we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do.&quot;    The Financial Services Act will allow the British government to revoke the license of a foreign financial institution if it believes the institution's home country doesn't give British institutions equal access to its market.    Michael Howard, minister for corporate and consumer affairs, will outline Britain's planned financial-industry retaliation when he meets with Japanese government officials next month, Trade Minister Alan Clark told Parliament Wednesday. &quot;This is the one sector where we have the possibility of immediate retaliation where appropriate,&quot; Mr. Clark said.    Japanese financiers, however, expressed incredulity at the threatened sanctions. This issue &quot;isn't related to financial business,&quot; said Yoji Okabe, managing director of the London branch of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. of Tokyo.    A Japanese Embassy official said: &quot;It's a crazy debate. Every country has very strange members of Parliament.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
