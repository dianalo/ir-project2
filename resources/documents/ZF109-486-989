(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Electronics for Imaging: Quality Color on the DesktopandM;ELECTRONICS FOR IMAGING (EFI) commenced operations in May 1989.andP;  It wasfounded by a few Scitex veterans to develop products for the (thennonexistent) color desktop publishing market.andP;  Recently, it revealed itsstrategy for making good-quality, &quot;no surprises&quot; color printing accessible tothe occasional or lay user.andP;  It has developed a technology that it callsColor Portability, along with a number of hardware and software products thatwill hit the market next year:andM;* Eport Color Server system software;andM;*Cachet color editing application software;andM;* Firey controller for color copiers;andM;* Color Receiver for service bureaus and commercial print shops.andM;We are impressed with the breadth of EFI's attack on the problems of colorprinting.andP;  It is attempting to stimulate the color market simultaneously inthe areas of output devices, easy-to-use applications and device-independentcolor communication technology.andM;The problemandM;Four-color printing is more than four times as hard as monochrome printing.andO;The problems aren't limited to the huge files that color scanners cangenerate, the seemingly infinite number of ways to tweak the settings ofcolor manipulation software, or the high cost of reproduction on colorpresses.andP;  The deeper problems are rooted in the expectations we all have forcolor.andP;  Readers are much less tolerant of minor color errors than they are ofdensity variations in monochrome halftones.andP;  Everyone knows how grass and skyand human faces (the &quot;memory colors&quot;) should look, and when a picture doesn'tlook like that, it is glaringly obvious.andM;When you try to put two pictures side by side on the page, the problems arecompounded.andP;  The photographs may have been taken under different lightingconditions, with different brands of film and different exposure settings.andO;They may have been digitized on different scanners.andP;  Nonetheless, when thepage is printed the reader will expect to see the same grass, sky and fleshtones in each picture.andP;  It is not enough to make each picture look right inisolation; both pictures have to be &quot;the same right.&quot;andM;Needed: expertise.andP;  There is no lack of tools for color-correcting scannedimages.andP;  Desktop computers running software such as Adobe's Photoshop andLetraset's ColorStudio are sufficiently powerful, in the hands of anexperienced user, to deliver highly acceptable output.andP;  Given decent inputdata from a good-quality scanner, desktop tools have the features andfunctions to do the job--provided that the operator knows what he is doing oris willing to spend lots of time experimenting.andM;There are comparatively few desktop publishers who fall into the category ofexpert user, however.andP;  The potential market for color would be much larger ifthere were a way for the occasional user to obtain reliable and pleasingresults on the first try.andP;  For this to happen, the color know-how that expertusers now have must be embedded in the desktop publishing software; or, toput it another way, technique must be replaced with technology.andM;Total automation?andP;  The variations between images caused by different lightingconditions, camera settings and brands of film are usually beyond the controlof the publisher, so color correction will remain a necessary evil.andP;  Even ifvery smart software is developed, we doubt that it will be possible to fullyautomate the correction process, because the proper correction for a givenimage depends as much on the publisher's intentions as on the image itself.andM;For example, suppose you have a picture of a bird soaring over a lake inwhich a fish is jumping.andP;  Do you want to optimize the subtleties of the colorof the water?andP;  the speckling of the trout?andP;  the shadows under the bird'swing?andP;  The original film probably holds considerable detail in all of theseareas, even though one area may be very light and another very dark.andP;  A colorprinter or a press, however, has a much more limited range of densities andcolors.andP;  A satisfactory rendering of details in a bright area will thus comeat the expense of details in the dark areas, and vice versa.andP;  So the user'sjudgment will always be needed.andM;WYSIWYG is not enough.andP;  In other issues of this Report, we have noted thenecessity for regular calibration of the monitor that will be used for colorediting.andP;  It will also be obvious that the printer must be calibrated ifreliable output is to be possible.andP;  In the best of all possible worlds, youwould like to have a WYSIWYG color system in which the appearance of colorson the screen accurately predicts the appearance of the printed page.andM;This goal is not truly attainable.andP;  Here's why:andM;* Different gamuts.andP;  The range of colors that can be reproduced is differentfor each kind of device.andP;  CRT displays generally offer a wider range of colorintensities than printers--the glowing phosphors can deliver more highlysaturated colors.andP;  But a press can print some blue and red hues that arebeyond the ability of standard CRT phosphors to produce.andM;* Nonlinear color mixing.andP;  The process-color inks on a press may look justlike the colors of a thermal-transfer printer's ribbon.andP;  Nonetheless, thereis no guarantee that a specific proportion of cyan, magenta, yellow and blackwill mix to the same perceived color on a press, on a thermal printer, on anink-jet printer and on a color copier.andP;  Even though all of them use the basicsubtractive colors, each device has its peculiarities.andP;  Monitors, which useadditive colors, have entirely different properties.andM;WYSIWYG--what you see is what you get--is thus very hard to achieve.andP;  Eventhe highly trained operators of Scitex, Hell and Crosfield propress systems,though their equipment is first class from top to bottom, do not rely on thecolors shown on the screen.andP;  Instead, they use their system's &quot;onscreendensitometer&quot; function to read the numeric values of colors, which (throughyears of experience) they are able to interpret in terms of the final printedoutput.andM;Systems for the lay-tech userandM;Many of today's desktop publishers might like to add color photos to some oftheir publications but are deterred by the above-mentioned problems.andP;  A fewhardy pioneers have explored the territory, and have (painfully) begun tobuild up a store of experience and judgment.andP;  Most users, though, haven't thetime for that kind of experimenting; they are waiting for software that canbe relied on to deliver pleasing results on the first try.andM;An historical analogy.andP;  Efi Arazi, the founder of Scitex and EFI, hassuggested that there is a parallel between the development of typesettingsystems and color systems.andP;  In the days of hot lead, typesetting was done byhighly trained craftsmen using expensive and complex--evendangerous--equipment.andP;  It cost a lot, so only documents that were going to beprinted in high volume were typeset.andM;In the 1970s, computerized composition &quot;front-end&quot; systems and phototypsetter&quot;back ends&quot; simplified the process of laying out a page of type.andP;  Operatorsstill needed to learn a lot of markup codes and had to operate acomputer--they had to be technicians, rather than a craftsmen.andP;  Typesettingbecame an office job, and companies such as Compugraphic sold thousands ofmachines to an ever-growing market.andM;In the '80s, WYSIWYG desktop publishing programs and laser printers madetypesetting easy to learn and inexpensive to produce.andP;  It became commonplaceto &quot;typeset&quot; everything, even throw-away interoffice memos.andP;  A desktoppublisher still had to know a bit about graphic design, but he could belargely ignorant of the technical underpinnings of his equipment.andP;  That is,he could be a knowledgeable layman--what Arazi calls a &quot;lay tech&quot; user.andP;  Andcompanies such as Aldus and Apple sold millions of shrink-wrapped programsand desktop computers to satisfy the demand for desktop typography.andM;In the color business, the story seems to be running about ten years behind.andO;The old days of film-based color separations and cyanide dot etching lastedthrough the '70s.andP;  The work was expensive and dangerous, and separatorslearned their craft through years of darkroom apprenticeship.andM;In the '80s, firms such as Scitex and Crosfield replaced all that withelectronic scanners and computer-based retouching systems.andP;  Although thesesystems were expensive and required expert operators, they were much easierto use and more productive than darkroom processes.andP;  The color separationbusiness had moved into the &quot;technician&quot; phase.andP;  Scitex and its brethrenprospered mightily.andM;If the analogy holds, the next step--the development of &quot;lay tech&quot; colorsystems--will take place in the '90s.andP;  However, as we have seen, theobstacles to today's color desktop publisher are formidable indeed.andO;Overcoming these obstacles is the task that Electronics for Imaging has setfor itself.andP;  If it succeeds, the market for desktop color should grow byleaps and bounds--a market in which EFI hopes to be well positioned.andM;Taking the analogy furtherandM;There are also some very interesting parallels between the development of thedesktop publishing market and the emerging desktop color market that EFIwould like to bring into being.andP;  Here is how we see EFI's strategy:andM;As everyone knows, the desktop publishing phenomenon was made possible by thecombination of four mass-marketed components: a graphic computer platform, aflexible raster imaging device, a page-description language that alloweddevice-independent printing, and an application that captured people'simagination and took full advantage of the other three ingredients.andM;While all four components were necessary, we think that PostScript's role wasparticularly crucial.andP;  It provided device independence through the mechanismof an abstract imaging model for type and graphics and a language formanipulating that model.andP;  It thus promoted competition and innovation in theother three components.andM;The promise of PostScript was threefold:andM;* No matter what computer and printer you used, as long as the computeremitted PostScript commands and the printer had a PostScript interpreter, theprinted results would be the same, at least up to the limit of the printer'sresolution.andM;* The results would be pleasing, even at low resolution, due to the &quot;hints&quot;in the fonts.andM;* There would be an &quot;escape valve&quot; to high-end printing via Linotype'sPostScript imagesetters.andM;Adobe's agreement with Linotype was an important aspect of PostScript'spopularity.andP;  It meant that you could work up a design on your LaserWriter,making as many changes as you liked for about a nickel a page.andP;  You couldthen take the same file to a service bureau and run it off at highresolution, with an image quality that even an old-time craftsman couldn'tfault.andP;  This made PostScript respectable among graphic arts professionals.andM;Multi-prong attack.andP;  EFI has taken these lessons to heart.andP;  It believes thatthe same components will be necessary for a comparable desktop colorpublishing phenomenon to take place.andP;  However, it intends to drive the marketin three of the four areas, leaving only the manufacturing of the computerplatforms to Apple, IBM, Next and others.andP;  Whether the Canon Color LaserCopier is the color equivalent of the CX laser printer is debatable.andP;  Wesuspect that current CLCs are too expensive to properly fill this niche.andO;Nonetheless, there is already an installed base of CLCs in corporations andquick-print shops that EFI hopes it can sell Firey controllers to.andP;  In time,we believe, cheaper color copiers will arrive.andM;(However, we do think that the Firey controller [details below] is theequivalent of the LaserWriter's controller.andP;  As you may recall, Apple calledits first LaserWriter &quot;the most powerful computer we've ever made.&quot;andP;  It hadtwice as much memory as Apple's flagship &quot;fat Mac,&quot; which was a 512K,68000-based computer.andP;  The parallels are instructive.)andM;EFI's shrink-wrapped color editing application program, expected to hit themarket next year, will be called Cachet.andP;  It is too soon to tell whetherCachet will capture the imagination the way PageMaker did.andP;  (For one thing,the software is still being written.)andP;  But we think that it will at least bea big step toward the lay user's goal of preparing color images that meet hisexpectations on the first try.andM;Color Portability: a central roleandM;Like Adobe's PostScript language, EFI's Color Portability technology is not atangible product.andP;  Rather, it is a device-independent way of describingcolors and a collection of techniques for manipulating and transforming colorspaces.andP;  This technology is designed to be embodied in some particular piecesof EFI software--the Eport Color Server and the Cachet color editingprogram--and may also be licensed to other vendors for incorporation intotheir products.andM;CIE standard.andP;  Underlying the technology is the work done in the 1930s by theCommission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE), which defined for the firsttime a standardized system of measuring color perception.andP;  A number ofvariations have been developed on the original CIE standard, but all of themshare certain attributes:andM;* A standard illuminant--a light source whose spectral characteristics arewell defined.andM;* A standard observer, usually implemented as a statistical average of manyreal human observers.andP;  Two colors are defined to be the same (relative to aparticular illuminant) when they are perceived as matching when viewed sideby side.andP;  Color samples that match under one illuminant but don't match undera different illuminant are said to be metamers.andM;* A three-dimensional color space.andP;  That is, to specify any color preciselyand uniquely, you must supply three values.andP;  The major differences betweenthe various CIE-derived systems are in the definition of the three colordimensions.andM;For example, EFI prefers to work with the CIELAB system, in which thevariables are:andM;--lightness (the black and white component);andM;--an &quot;a&quot; variable that places the color along a redness--greenness axis;andM;--a &quot;b&quot; variable that places the color on a blueness--yellowness axis.andM;This choice of variables is based on a theory of color opposites: that acolor never has both green and red characteristics simultaneously, nor blueand yellow simultaneously.andP;  The CIELUV model, which is the basis forTektronix's software, uses similar variables but a different scale.andP;  Theimportant thing, however, about all the various CIE-based systems is that onecolor space can be transformed into another by a simple calculation.andM;RGB is another three-variable color space, but it is not based on colormatching under standard illuminants.andP;  In addition to specifying thechromaticities of the particular red, green and blue phosphors, these systemsmust also define a reference-white color temperature.andP;  There are actuallyseveral different &quot;standard&quot; RGB systems in commercial use.andP;  The specs set bythe National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) differ slightly from thoseof the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), forexample.andP;  But the desktop publisher has no way of knowing whether a given RGBscanner or monitor conforms to any of the published standards.andM;Schreiber patent.andP;  An important ingredient of EFI's Color Portabilitytechnology is the Schreiber patent (U.S.andP;  patent no.andP;  4,500,919).andP;  The patentis owned by MIT, which granted an exclusive licence to EFI.andP;  The patentclaims cover:andM;* Devices for interpreting color appearance parameters expressed in adevice-independent color space (including CIE-based spaces);andM;* Systems that use scanners and color printers where prior to automatic,calibrated colorant selection, the data is manipulated in the form ofdevice-independent tristimulus colorimetric information;andM;* An excess-gamut alarm on a color display;andM;* A technique for using lookup tables to compensate for the characteristicsof color presses or printers.andM;There are other claims, as well.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  10, p. 41.)andP;  Theexistence of this patent is basic to EFI's business plan.andP;  It means thatanyone who wants to produce a color editing system involving calibrateddisplays and printers has to get a license from EFI.andP;  This presents aclear-cut challenge to Adobe's hopes for Level 2 PostScript, which is whyAdobe filed a lawsuit in June challenging the validity of the patent.andM;Algorithms.andP;  In addition to the patent, EFI has developed a fair amount ofsoftware that implements the concepts of device-independent color.andP;  Amongother things, it has modules for color table lookup followed by interpolation(used to go from a CIE color space to the printer's CYMK color space),techniques for choosing a printable color to substitute for a color requestthat is out of gamut, and so on.andM;Eport Color ServerandM;The heart of EFI's product line is perhaps the hardest to describe.andP;  It isthe Eport Color Server: a group of software modules that implement the ColorPortability technology.andP;  It includes a database containing device descriptors(fudge factors) for each printer in the system, as well as each monitor,scanner, etc.andP;  (Some of these devices might be at remote locations; we'lltalk more about this when we get to the Color Receiver, below.)andP;  It alsoincludes a kernel of algorithms for transforming the color space of onedevice to that of another, along with a well-defined application programminginterface for invoking those algorithms.andP;  Finally, it has utility routinesfor adding new devices to the database, updating descriptors and so on.andM;The term &quot;server&quot; probably conjures up the notion that this has something todo with networks.andP;  But that's not the case.andP;  While the Color Server could beimplemented as a centralized network function, it is more likely to be foundrunning in each workstation.andP;  The Color Server is really designed to be asystem service, on a par with the file manager or font rasterizer.andP;  Note thatan X-Window display is called an X server for the same reason: it provideswindowing services to a client, which is the application program.andP;  TheXserver and client may or may not be executing on the same processor.andM;The Color Server does several jobs:andM;* It can tansform a color value in one color space to a corresponding valuein a different space.andP;  And application program could use this function totransform a scanned image into the standard CIELAB color space.andP;  From thisstandard representation, the image could be transformed again for display onthe monitor (by using the database's factors for the display) or for outputon a printer (using the printer's factors).andP;  Each transformation attempts togive the best possible rendering of the image, subject to each device'slimitations on dynamic range and color gamut.andP;  As noted above, this is notalways a simple task.andM;Note that the Server need not actually alter the scanned data that is held ondisk to do this.andP;  Instead, it could first use the display's fudge factors totransform the scanner's fudge factors, then use the results to transform theimage data just once on its way to the display.andP;  However, you may think ofthe data as being stored at all times in CIELAB form.andM;* It can test whether a particular color is within the gamut of a device.andP;  Acolor editing program could use this to show what parts of the screen imagewill not be reproducible on the selected printer--to offer an &quot;excess gamutalarm&quot; function.andP;  The user would then decide whether to edit the imagefurther in an attempt to stay within the printer's gamut.andP;  This, however, isa judgment call; the areas that are out of gamut may not contain any detailsthe user cares about.andM;*It provides primitives for maintaining the database.andM;Because it is essentially system-level software, like fonts and screenwindowing, we would not be surprised to see firms such as Apple, Microsoftand Sun licensing the Eport technology (or developing competing versions ofthe technology) for inclusion in their operating systems.andM;EFI has also developed image compression and decompression software.andP;  EFI hasfor some time been licensing a JPEG-compatible compression software package(which it has named Ecomp) to third parties.andP;  Whether implemented as part ofColor Server or elsewhere, image compression is important for practicalapplications, bacause raw scanned images comprise huge amounts of data.andM;Firey and ASOAandM;Acting on the assumption that color copiers are likely to be the dominantshort-run color duplicating devices in the next few years, EFI is working ona high-performance PostScript-compatible controller for digital colorcopiers.andP;  It is named Firey.andP;  The first version (which is now in theprototype stage) will drive the Canon Color Laser Copier family.andM;At least in its first incarnation, Firey will be a set of three boards thatplug into an ordinary AT-class PC clone.andP;  The clone merely serves as alow-cost card cage, power supply, disk drive and case; the controller isintended to be a dedicated &quot;black box,&quot; not a general-purpose computer.andP;  Theclone's '386 processor will only be used for simple I/O functions such asdownloading code from the disk drive into Firey's working memory.andM;One of the boards will house a MIPS R3000 processor and supporting circuity:cache memory, FIFO buffers (first-in first-out pipelines), programmable gatearrays and so on.andM;The second board holds 64 MB of image memory, which supports a full page of32-bit pixels at 400 dpi.andP;  The SIMMS are custom-built for EFI, but useordinary 80-ns 4-megabit chips.andP;  (Memory will be the most costly ingredientof the controller.)andP;  The processor and memory boards communicate over a fastprivate data bus.andM;The third board in the set is for the interface to the copier.andP;  For the Canoncopier, EFI is bypassing Canon's own IPU interface and driving the makingengine's innards via a service connector.andP;  Although Canon does not officiallysupport third-party use of this connector, the IPU does not offer sufficientfunctionality for EFI's image-quality goals.andM;The interface board communicates with the processor over another private bus.andO;The connection to the copier is now a ribbon cable, but EFI is looking aheadto a tidier-looking optical fiber link.andP;  Other copiers will doubtless requiretheir own interface designs, which is the reson for segregating interfacefunctions onto a separate board.andM;Firey will accept PostScript input via standard networks or SCSU interfacesfrom a Mac or PC running page makeup software.andP;  We do not know from whom EFIhas licensed the PostScript interpreter code.andM;Even though Firey uses the same MIPS processor as Adobe's Emerald RIP, thereis at least one significant difference between the two designs.andP;  Emerald isoptimized for halftoning, while Firey is a continuous-tone RIP and thus moresuitable for driving low-resolution controne color printers.andM;ASOA.andP;  As users are well aware, color copiers are rather finicky and unstabledevices.andP;  The color can vry from hour to hour in strange and unpredictableways.andP;  In view of the effort EFI is putting into characterizing andcalibrating printers and monitors with the Export color server, it will be nosurprise that it is working on a way to stabilize the Canon CLC's output.andO;EFI calls its approach Automatic Stabilization of Appearance (ASOA).andM;ASOA involves a small photodetector unit at the output end of the colorprinter.andP;  From time to time, the Firey controller will print a test pagecontaining color panels.andP;  The ASOA detectors will measure the resulting colordensity and then will either make automatic adjustments to the CLC's internalcolor settings or alert the operator that the machine has drifted completelyout of range and that a service call is required.andM;Factory colorimetry.andP;  Important as it is to stabilize the printer, ASOA isnot substitute for a thorough colorimetric characterization.andP;  ASOA makes aseries of single-ink densitometer reading-essentially the same process anyservice bureau uses to calibrate its imagesetter.andP;  It cannot deal with thenon-linear distortions in four-dimensional colorant space that occur wheninks are blended, nor can it tell you what you need to know about thedevice's total gamut.andM;Unfortunately, a proper full-color characterization requires a colorimeter--afairly expensive ($5,000 and up) piece of precision test equipment.andP;  A largecommercial printing house can easily afford one, but we doubt that theaverage corner quick-print shop would want to invest that much.andP;  EFI is stillinvestigating the best way to deal with this problem.andP;  In the short term, itwill perform the necessary analyses for its customers' machines in its ownlab.andM;In the long run, EFI hopes that color printer manufacturers will analyzetheir machines at the factory and ship them with a floppy disk containing thecharacterization data (much as Winchester disk drives are now shipped with amedia-defect map) that the customer can simply read into his Eport database.andO;We think this is likely to happen when the number of users who have becomesensitized to the need for device-independent color printing approaches acritical mass.andM;Cachet color editorandM;As we have noted above, the color that a user perceives depends on suchvariables as room lighting, paper stock (for printed pieces), displaysettings and so on.andP;  Many of these variables can be controlled (monitors canbe calibrated, for instance) and others can be compensated (papers andprinters can be characterized).andP;  And some, such as how to reduce the dynamicrange of a photo down to what can be rendered on a printer, are best left asvariables, set according to the discretion of the user and the nature of theimage itself.andM;This is the task of EFI's color editor application program, called Cachet.andO;It will first appear on the Macintosh, probably next spring.andP;  Its goal is toprovide color correction tools that a &quot;lay tech&quot; user will be able to useunder ordinary office conditions and without extensive training.andP;  Inparticular, Cachet is designed to work with uncalibrated, run-of-the-millmonitors viewed under a wide range of room lighting conditions.andP;  The programis not trying to compete with ColorStudio or Photoshop, but aims rather toprovide the kind of &quot;good enough on the first try&quot; color printing that officeusers need for good productivity.andM;Although the software is still embryonic, we are impressed with what we haveseen so far.andP;  EFI has been prototyping the algorithms on Sun workstations--aprocess that is nearing completion.andP;  We understand that the company hasapplied for a patent on parts of the system.andM;Meanwhile, a team of Mac programmers has been implementing the algorithms onthe Macintosh and designing the user interface using Think Pascal, MacApp andC.andP;  This will assure that the program looks and feels like a real Mac productand adheres closely to all expectations of Macintosh users.andP;  Not too muchfarther along, EFI will begin porting to Windows and other environments.andM;Color ReceiverandM;Adobe's PostScript language benefited from the Linotype connection; the&quot;escape hatch&quot; to high-end typesetting conferred respectability on the newtechnology.andP;  In the same vein, EFI believes that color desktop publisherswill want an escape hatch to high-end color printing.andM;The Color Receiver, although not yet a completely defined product, isintended to play this role.andP;  It will be sold to commercial color separationhouses and print shops, and will allow such shops to accept files fromdesktop systems (via disk, mag tape, modem, etc.) for high-volumereproduction.andP;  It will comprise the following ingredients:andM;* Eport Color Server technology to transform incoming color data asappropriate for the gamut and density range achievable on the shop'simagesetting and printing equipment.andP;  The Color Server packages the colordata in a form suitable for the shop's PostScript RIP or color prepresssystem.andM;* Tools for characterizing the printing equipment in terms of the ColorServer's database.andP;  These tools would include colorimetric test equipment,analytic software, staff training and so on.andM;The print shop would characterize its presses for each kind of ink and paperthat it used, updating the measurements at regular intervals to take accountof machine wear and maintenance.andP;  It would also distribute the descriptors toits customs, who would install them in their own Export databases.andM;These customers could then tailor the editing of their image files to matchthe limitations of the press.andP;  They could prepare color publications in theiroffices, using low-cost thermal or ink-jet printers or color copier/printersto make as many design interations as they wanted to.andP;  Then they would sendthe digital data to the print shop, where it would be rendered at highresolution and printed in high volume.andP;  In time, customers might become soconfident of the results that they would not even ask to see a Chromalinproof; the goal of Color Portability technology is to guarantee that thepress delivered &quot;no surprises&quot; reproduction.andM;Color service bureau.andP;  EFI experts that a color shop would also want to offercalibration services to its cutomers, using its colorimetric equipment toupdate the characterization factors for their office printers.andP;  In effect, acommercial printer equipped with a Color Receiver would play all of the rolesthat a PostScript service bureau plays for desktop publishers today.andP;  Itwould provide the high-end escape hatch for output, access to expensive testequipment and skilled personnel, and consulting services on color design.andM;EFI believes that there will always be a need for experienced craftsmen toprovide top-quality color for the most demanding printing work, such asmagazine advertising.andP;  Rather than a displacement of today's color prepressshops, the firm expects to generate a considerable expansion in the demandfor OK-quality short-run color printing.andP;  A Color Receiver-equipped printerwill be able to tackle perhaps 85% of the color printing work that the officeworld generates, but that last 15% will remain the province of Scitex, Hell,Crosfield and Screen.andM;Near-term EportandM;Eport is system software.andP;  It cannot work in isolation; color editingprograms, printer drivers, scanners and display systems must call on it whenthey need to render device-independent color on a specific device.andP;  It willtake time for application developers to modify their software to takeadvantage of a Color Server.andM;In the meantime, EFI is looking into the possibility of a very specific&quot;hack&quot; for the Macintosh environment: a patch for the LaserWriter devicedriver that will intercept QuickDraw and PostScript color demands and passthem to an Eport module for device-specific corrections.andP;  The Eport codewould perform an appropriate translation, then send the altered date to theoriginal printer driver for output.andP;  The result would be printed output thatis more predictable (relative to the screen) and hence more reliable.andO;Obviously, it would only be useful if you have a calibrated monitor on yourMac.andM;Whether such a trick would work depends largely on the complexity of thePostScript code each application emits.andP;  If the code were complex, it couldfool the Eport module and the results would not be pleasing.andP;  However, mostof today's popular applications do not seem to use excessively complicatedPostScript output.andM;Chicken vs.andP;  eggandM;As with any introduction of new technology, there is a definite &quot;chicken andegg&quot; problem.andP;  System vendors and hardware makers won't support ColorPortability unless their customers demand it.andP;  Users may want to move intocolor desktop publishing eventually, but without calibrated scanners,printers, monitors and system software, they have little incentive to makethe move now.andM;EFI is doing what it can to stoke the fires, however.andP;  It is working on OEMtechnology licenses with hardware makers, hoping that they will routinelyship their products with Eport descriptor files.andP;  It is also planning toinclude its own descriptors for the most popular devices in the Eport andCachet products it sells.andM;It is also preparing a coffee-table book on the practical aspects of desktopcolor correction.andP;  The book's purpose is to increase users' confidence thatthey can recognize and deal with the routine problems of color printing.andM;Prospects.andP;  We are impressed by what we have seen of EFI's technology.andP;  As wehave noted throughout this article, the products are still in the developmentstage.andP;  We expect that demonstrable (albeit possibly incomplete) prototypeswill appear by the end of this year.andP;  Beta-test versions of Cachet, Eport andFirey will be distributed during the first half of 1991.andP;  Beta-test versionsof the Color Receiver should arrive in the second half of 1991.andM;It strikes us that the kind of multi-front attack EFI is mounting on theproblems of color desktop publishing will be very important in thedevelopment of this segment of the market.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
