Honecker, a hard-line communist, underwent gallbladder surgerylast month.   The ZDF television network quoted Western diplomatic sources inHungary as saying Honecker's medical condition ``has deterioratedconsiderably.''   ``According to information that allegedly comes from CommunistParty officials, Honecker has no mental verve and no wish to getbetter,'' ZDF said.   The Hamburg-based newspaper Bild had a front-page headline saying``Honecker Wants To Die.''   Bild, citing unidentified sources in East Berlin, said: ``Thecondition of the Communist leader has worsened badly'' and Honecker``has lost the will to live.''   The 77-year-old Honecker has resisted the reforms sweeping muchof the Soviet bloc and thousands of East Germans are fleeing theircountry because of the political and economic situation.   Thousands escaped Monday to West Germany after Hungary allowedEast Germans who had gathered in refugee camps to pass freely acrossthe border into Austria. East Germany bitterly denounced Hungary, afellow member of the Warsaw Pact.   ZDF said of East Germany's ruling Communists, ``Critics in thePolitburo reportedly are charging that Honecker misjudged themeaning and scope of the wave of refugees.''   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog told TheAssociated Press in a telephone interview that reports on Honecker'scondition are ``pure speculation. We have no first-hand informationon this.''   Two weeks ago, Western intelligence sources said Honecker'sgallbladder surgery had to be abandoned because of the weakness ofsurrounding tissue.   Some news reports speculated that Honecker has cancer.   East Germany's state news agency ADN said early this month thatHonecker had been released from the hospital and had taken avacation to recover. It has not carried any recent reports on hiscondition.   Communist Party sources in East Berlin, speaking on the conditionthey not be identified, told AP over the weekend that there were``clear signs'' Honecker's mental capacity was failing and hiscondition had caused a delay in top-level decisions.   Bild is published by the Springer concern, which has been acritic of Honecker for decades.</TEXT></DOC>
