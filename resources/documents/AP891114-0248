Inc. said Tuesday it isintroducing an interactive 900-number telephone service that willenable callers to get stock quotes, business and financial news,sports reports and weather conditions.   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, plans to charge85 cents for the first minute and 75 cents for each additionalminute for calls to its service, called JournalPhone.   The service begins operation Wednesday and will be promoted eachweekday with advertising in the Journal.   Its creators called the service ``a logical extension'' of thenewspaper.   ``It picks up where the Journal leaves off and offers an easy,convenient way to keep on top of the news as it develops throughoutthe day,'' said Kenneth L. Burenga, a senior vice president of DowJones.   Callers who want to find out at mid-morning what the latestgovernment indicators showed, for example, can hear a recordedreport by dialing 1-900-JOURNAL and pushing the appropriatetelephone buttons as prompted by the service.   When callers have heard enough, they can push a few more buttonsand obtain 15-minute delayed quotes on any of 6,500 stock prices;regularly updated reports on the overall stock, bond or currencymarkets; information about weather in selected cities; or reportson sports stories or scores.   The calls will be charged on regular monthly phone bills.   Dow Jones is not the first newspaper publisher to providetelephone services, although its service may offer the widest arrayof reports.   A number of newspapers, for instance, provide sports scores bytelephone for the cost of a local telephone call.   Gannett Co. Inc.'s USA Today provides four call-in services on900-numbers, including hotlines for sports information and scores,weather reports, lottery results and horse racing results.   Phil Fuhrer, vice president of Gannett New Media, said thesports hotline receives 2.7 million calls a year at 60 cents forthe first minute and 45 cents for each minute after that. ``Itextends our coverage to 24 hours a day,'' he said.   Dow Jones executives said they were not sure how many calls toexpect on their new service. It tested the service for three monthsthis past summer in Atlanta, where about 10,000 Journal readerswere invited to use the system for free. The test showed theaverage calls lasted about two minutes.   The company already provides a more expensive interactivetelephone service for active traders and plans to use the samestaff and facilities for its new service which is geared moretoward average investors.   Dow Jones expects the new service to be profitable from thestart.</TEXT></DOC>
