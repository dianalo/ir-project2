Butit's another thing entirely to try to make a buck off it, as does a companycalled Radar World Chicago when you call (900) USA-DANNY. That's apay-per-call hustle ($2 for the first minute, 99 cents per minute thereafter)luring customers with the latest Quayle jokes and a &quot;Danny Doll Song,&quot; askingthem to cast their straw vote on whether to retain Quayle in the 1992 electionand then offering such Quaylephernalia as watches ($29.90) that have thenumbers out of order and &quot;Rebel Without a Clue&quot; T-shirts ($14) with the veep'shead superimposed on James Dean's body. Truly tacky stuff, but if we're goingto lose all taste on political matters, at least we should be bipartisan aboutit. I'm waiting for the 900 number where people can call to order the TeddyKennedy Family Fun Kit -- you know, 101 things to do at the beach after dark,maybe a pin-the-pants-on-the-senator game, a list of defense lawyers' homephone numbers. Otherwise, enough already.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PROFIT-HUNTERS TAKE CHEAP SHOTS AT POOR QUAYLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Leigh Weimers column  </MEMO><TEXT>     ARTBEATS -- And all this time you thought it was only work. New York'sMuseum of Modern Art has anointed the microchip as art -- &quot;an icon of ourtechnological civilization,&quot; they call it -- and will open an exhibition ofchip designs there Sept. 6, then send it on a national tour. First stop: SantaClara's Triton Museum of Art, Nov. 30 to Jan. 7, where onlookers may not be soawestruck by the discovery. . . . San Jose artist Katherine Levin-Lau,celebrating her recent show at the d.p. Fong Galleries where collectorssnapped up every work, headed for the Big Apple, where she just as quicklyfound gallery representation (the Sherry French). Levin-Lau and d.p. Fongdirector Fred Spratt also took time to break bread with New Yorker Doug Vogel,a San Jose State art alum, and transplanted San Josean Mark Tansey, one ofManhattan's hot painters. Also doing the New York routine: Mike Danoff,director of the San Jose Museum of Art, who was there for a press conferenceoutlining the museum's new wing. And, perhaps, considering a Tansey show inhis hometown museum one day? . . . There'll be no earth-shaking developments,Janet Greenleaf hopes, when she reopens her Saratoga gallery Thursday, butthere may be a sense of deja vu. The gallery has been closed since the LomaPrieta earthquake damaged it and, in the process, disrupted an exhibition byTomi Kobara. Whose works will be there for the reopening? Kobara's.;    SICKTRANSIT -- No sooner was it itemed here that a Sarasota, Fla., transit linewas using the SCAT acronym scorned by Santa Clara County Transit for itstrolleys then along comes reader Margaret Tedrow with another. Down Venturaway, she reports, the Southern Coast Area Transit calls itself you-know-what,apparently without critics' comparing it to animal droppings. . . . Can't betoo careful with acronyms, though. David Siden remembers when a SouthernCalifornia burg, Fillmore, tried to upgrade the image of its buses by labelingthem Fillmore Area Rapid Transit. &quot;The buses were on the streets and in usebefore the remarkable acronym was called to their attention,&quot; Siden says.&quot;They quickly dropped the word 'Area.' &quot;;    DRY SPELL -- San Josean DonMcClung also is taken by the May issue of California magazine's description ofthe Mexican resort Cancun: &quot;It is simultaneously glamorous and decedent.&quot; &quot;Ifit's decedent,&quot; McClung notes, &quot;it certainly is laid back.&quot;  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910513  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  625  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 13, 199100134122,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
