As one travel firm, Sobek Expeditions of Angels Camp, Calif.,put it in announcing environmental adventures for 1990 in suchplaces as Brazil, Costa Rica, India-Nepal, Tanzania and Indonesia:   ``(We) hope to translate enthusiasm for wild places into energydirected toward their preservation.''   Another organization, Overseas Adventure Travel of Cambridge,Mass., offers birding in remote rain forests of Costa Rica, gorillatrekking in Rwanda, hiking in Mount Everest National Park, safarisin Serengeti and treks in Machu Picchu National Park in Peru.   ``On an adventure cruise, passengers take an active role inevery aspect of the expedition,'' says Douglas Ward, executivedirector of the International Cruise Passengers Association.   ``Naturalists and lecturers are aboard each ship to providebackground information and regional observations about wildlife.''   Because of the briefings, lectures and a laboratory at sea,there is a cultural and intellectual element not found on othercruise ships, explains Ward, author of the Berlitz ``CompleteHandbook to Cruising.''   The adventure cruise vessel, he adds, provides elegant andcomfortable surroundings for up to 200 passengers, a highly trainedand knowledgeable staff and first-class food.   ``Without traditional cruise ports to stop at, the ship must beself-sufficient and capable of long-range cruising,'' Ward says.   Many of the cruises use small inflatable rubber boats known asZodiacs to get closer to their wildlife destinations because themother ships are too large to navigate some shallow rivers andtributaries.   Developed by famed explorer Jacques Cousteau, the boats hold upto 15 people and can penetrate deep into otherwise inaccessibleareas.   As Ward explains, ``the adventure cruise ship is seldom`alongside' a dock and is more likely to be found at anchor in asmall inlet or bay. For use as a diving base in warm waters, suchas around Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the Zodiac is ideal andis safe and unsinkable.''   Many conservation-oriented travel organizations play an activerole in supporting environmental preservation programs.   The Overseas Adventure group, for example, donates $40 perperson participating in their Kenya safaris to the Rhina Ark Fund,which helps finance the building of a fence to prevent poaching ofrhinos.   On Himalayan treks it uses no wood for cooking, which helpsprevent further deforestation, and all trash is carried out of themountains. In addition, a percentage of each trekker's fees goes tohelp maintain the trails and conservation programs.   And Chicago-based Classic Tours International, which offerspackages including cruises down Egypt's Nile River, donates aportion of each tour program to organizations dedicated to thepreservation of historic sites and the conservation of wildlife.</TEXT></DOC>
