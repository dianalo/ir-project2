In a new poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates, state and federal judges cited frivolous suits and defenses, incompetent legal work and abuse of discovery -- the information-gathering process -- as chief causes for logjams in the system. Two-thirds of the judges said that a shortage of judges also was a problem.    The survey of 200 federal and 800 state trial judges was commissioned by Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., Hartford, Conn.    The judges reported that they are fighting back by increasingly dishing out sanctions against offending attorneys or their clients for bringing a frivolous lawsuit, motion or defense. According to the survey, during the past three years 84% of federal judges imposed sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 52% of state judges imposed sanctions under state rules.    Rule 11 sanctions are left to the judge's discretion but most typically take the form of an award of attorney's fees or a fine. Sanctions also can include sending a lawyer to continuing education courses or requiring the lawyer to circulate the judge's opinion chastising the lawyer to his law firm or to his clients.    By overwhelming majorities, the judges responding to the Harris survey said they didn't believe that delay was caused by judges who didn't pull their own weight or were too cautious because of concern about being reversed by an appeals court.    Among the judges' recommendations for improvement: court-appointed expert witnesses, more guidance for jurors during complex cases and trying the liability and damages parts of large cases separately.    Several prominent trial attorneys say they believe that judges must share the blame with lawyers for any problems with the system. &quot;You do have abuses of discovery,&quot; concedes Don Reuben, senior litigation counsel of the Chicago law firm of Winston andamp; Strawn. &quot;But judges are supposed to prevent it, and they have a laissez-faire attitude.&quot;    &quot;If judges are eliminating themselves (as a cause for delay) that's wrong,&quot; says New York trial attorney Paul Rheingold.    The increased use of Rule 11 sanctions by federal judges may fuel the growing controversy among lawyers about such sanctions. Critics charge that filing a Rule 11 claim is now standard procedure for the winning side, thus causing more litigation. Others are concerned by evidence that Rule 11 is applied disproportionately against plaintiffs, particularly in civil rights cases, according to Georgene Vairo, professor of law at Fordham University School of Law.    These lawyers attribute delays in federal court to the fact that criminal cases are tried first, backing up the civil cases. And they agree with the poll's finding that a shortage of judges plays a significant factor in judicial backlog.    &quot;This poll was stimulated by our concern that there are real problems with the efficiency of the system,&quot; says Judyth Pendell, assistant vice president for law and public affairs at Aetna. &quot;No group should know better than judges what would make the system run more efficiently.&quot;    But at least one judge disagrees with some of the poll's conclusions. &quot;It sounds like unwarranted lawyer bashing,&quot; says U.S. district Judge Joseph L. Tauro of Boston. </TEXT></DOC>
