As previously reported, Apache, an oil and natural gas concern, in December placed with seven institutional investors $160 million for profits interest in the properties. The new placement brings the total secured from institutional investors by Apache to $225 million. Apache said the investors would receive 75% to 90% of the profits from slightly more than one-third of the total properties. The company said proceeds will be used to retire bank debt incurred by Apache and Apache Petroleum Co. in the $222 million acquisition of oil and gas properties from Occidental. Apache Corp is based in Minneapolis. </TEXT></DOC>
