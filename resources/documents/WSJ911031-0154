The measure passed by a voice vote. Rep. Sam Gejdenson(D., Conn.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committeepanel that drafted the bill, called the final product a&quot;pro-work, pro-job&quot; bill that would clear unnecessarybarriers to U.S. exports.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would go further in liberalizingtelecommunications exports to the Soviet Union than theadministration has been willing to go. But the HouseDemocratic majority did the administration a favor by rollingback attempts by Republican conservatives to give thePentagon a stronger hand in licensing exports of bothcivilian and military value.   The Bush administration didn't offer any support for theconservatives' proposal, warning that any provision in thebill that &quot;dictates internal executive branch procedures&quot;would be grounds for a presidential veto.   Rep. Gejdenson said approval of the bill would prevent&quot;further erosion of congressionally mandated policies&quot; andmake the administration accountable to Congress again in thisarea of law. The administration's export-control system hasbeen operating under Mr. Bush's emergency powers since thepresident let the last export-control bill die in September1990.   The House still has to reconcile its latest bill with thefailed 1990 legislation, which the Senate approved again lastFebruary.   The White House said it objects to a provision in theHouse bill that effectively would allow the Soviet Union toacquire fiber-optic cable systems and sophisticatedtelecommunications switching gear. The administration alsoopposes portions of the bill that would tighten controls onnuclear exports to friendly countries.</TEXT></DOC>
