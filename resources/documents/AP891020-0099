Government officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker IIItelephoned Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir Thursday to try to get thestalled Middle East peace process restarted.   On Tuesday, Shamir publicly criticized U.S. proposals that hefears are aimed at pressuring Israel to talk with the PLO.   The English-language Jerusalem Post reported the United Stateshas offered to sign a ``memorandum of understanding'' to rule outany PLO involvement in preliminary peace talks. Israeli officialsdeclined comment.   Arab reporters said 24-year-old Taher Abu Saleh was stabbed todeath in Nablus. Shortly after dawn, they said, masked Palestinianspushed the corpse in a cart through Nablus' central market beforedumping it on the street.   The death was blamed on the Red Eagles, one of two Arab gangsreportedly active in Nablus against suspected collaborators.   The second killing occurred in the Gaza Strip's Breij refugeecamp. Arab reporters said Harb Odeh Essa, 43, was attacked in hishome by masked Palestinians. He was suspected of having ties withIsraeli authorities, they said.   Essa was dead on arrival at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, anddoctors said his throat was cut.   The army confirmed the Nablus killing and said it was checkingthe Gaza case.   The deaths raised to 132 the number of Palestinians killed byfellow Arabs in the 22-month uprising against Israeli rule in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 596 Palestinians, and40 Israelis have been slain.   Baker's call to Shamir followed three other recent contacts:Shamir's call to President Bush on Tuesday, a phone conversationWednesday between Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Baker,and a letter Thursday from Shamir to Baker.   All appeared aimed at easing tension created by Shamir Tuesday,when he warned members of his right-wing Likud bloc of ``a tenseperiod with the United States.''   He later told a political rally that ``The stone-throwers, thefire-bombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms of thePLO. It is not possible that when they fail to do this, others bydiplomatic means ... would try to bring us to meetings with thePLO.''   The comments were seen as slaps at Baker, who has put forward aproposal designed to get Israel to accept an invitation from Egyptfor preliminary talks with Palestinians.   Today, Shamir aide Avi Pazner told The Associated Press that inthe latest phone conversation Baker and Shamir discussed how tomove ahead on Israel's peace plan, which calls for elections in theoccupied lands as a first step toward limited autonomy.   The Jerusalem Post report said the Bush administration hasoffered to prepare a ``memorandum of understanding'' that wouldcover Shamir's main objections to Baker's plan. The memorandum, thePost said, would rule out involvement by the Palestine LiberationOrganization and restrict preliminary talks to Israel's proposedelections in the territories.   It quoted unnamed government sources as saying Shamir was ``notinclined to accept the administration's offer in its present form.''   Shamir is to visit Washington in mid-November to discuss thepeace process.</TEXT></DOC>
