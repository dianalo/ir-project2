The department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration contended that the company's Union CarbideChemicals andamp; Plastics Co. subsidiary operated the plant in amanner that created &quot;the potential for catastrophic explosioninvolving ethylene oxide -- a highly reactive chemical.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Further, Gerard Scannell, assistant secretary of labor forOSHA, said the company placed an ethylene oxide storage tankfacility near parts of the plant where it posed a threat of amuch larger explosion than occurred. The fire and explosionat the Seadrift plant killed an employee working for amaintenance contractor and injured 32 employees of UnionCarbide and other contractors.   OSHA said that prior to its inspection after the fire andexplosion, it inspected the plant seven times without findingsignificant violations. However, the agency noted that UnionCarbide has &quot;a significant enforcement history nationwide,&quot;including federal citations for willful violations issued tothe company's Institute, W.Va., plant in 1986. Atoxic-chemical leak at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal,India, killed more than 2,000 people in 1984.   Robert D. Kennedy, the company's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, said, &quot;Union Carbide will vigorouslycontest all citations issued today by OSHA. We profoundlydisagree with OSHA's characterization of alleged violationsas willful.&quot;   He added that &quot;the corporation firmly believes it hascomplied with the OSHA regulations and that the citations areunfounded.&quot;   According to OSHA, the Seadrift accident was caused when acolumn containing liquid ethylene oxide became overlypressurized and exploded, igniting a fire. A second fire wasstarted by a large piece of shrapnel striking a pipe rack,rupturing lines carrying methane and other chemicals.   The company has 15 working days to contest the citationsand proposed penalties before the independent OccupationalSafety and Health Review Commission.   Separately, OSHA urged employers and workers nationwide toreview the adequacy of fire-safety measures in theirworkplaces. Noting the fire last week that killed 25 ImperialFood Products workers at a poultry plant in Hamlet, N.C., Mr.Scannell said, &quot;It is apparent that there may be otherworkplaces with similar fire hazards.&quot;   OSHA will make a special effort to help reduce suchhazards, including emphasizing fire safety when OSHAconsultants visit workplaces and by asking heads ofOSHA-approved state job-safety and health programs to stressfire safety, Mr. Scannell said. Labor Secretary Lynn Martinhas ordered a review of the 25 OSHA-approved state- andterritory-run worker safety and health programs.</TEXT></DOC>
