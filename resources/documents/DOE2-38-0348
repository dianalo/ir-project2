Phonon spectrum was plotted assuming that in highly anisotropiccrystals phonon modes are groupped near the final frequency number. Opticalphonons are shown to make a noticeable contribution to the low temperaturespecific heat. To determine phonon spectrum specific heat low temperaturevalues are used. This permitted to neglect anharmonism contribution.</TEXT></DOC>
