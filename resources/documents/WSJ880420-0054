The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which plummeted from a 32-point gain at midafternoon, closed with a loss of 8.62 at 1999.50. Yesterday's drop followed a decline of 5.81 points Monday.    At the closing bell, advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange still outpaced decliners by about 56 issues. But gainers had held more than a 2-to-1 advantage for most of the session.    The improved quarterly results reported by several blue-chip companies gave investors some reassuring news in the early going, traders said, after some disappointing economic reports and news of skirmishes in the Middle East over the past few days. Higher bond prices, a firmer U.S. dollar and a drop in oil prices also provided positive support for the stock market, traders said.    Prices moved up steadily until late in the session. Bonds retraced their earlier gains and the prices of stock-index futures sank. At that point, traders said, it became beneficial for some professional investors to sell baskets of stocks that make up the indexes, such as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, and buy the now-cheaper stock futures contracts. Any would-be buyers headed for the sidelines, traders said.    Traders added that the market was set up for a fall by the lack of buying interest during its earlier rally. &quot;The institutions have not been involved in this market,&quot; said Brad Weekes, sales trading manager at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.    Broader stock market averages fell in lock step with the industrial average. The Sandamp;P 500 index fell 1.29 to 257.92 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 0.60 to 146.17. About 161.9 million shares were traded on the Big Board, compared with 144.7 million Monday.    Some traders said the afternoon sell-off might have been triggered by rumors that today's report on March consumer prices would show a rise of 0.9%. Such an increase would be more than double the 0.4% rise that most economists anticipate.    Brian J. Ludtke, a technical analyst at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc., Minneapolis, said the market's inability to escape the impact of futures-related selling is a clear indication of its uncertain outlook.    Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal andamp; Co., said the market's psychology is in poor shape. &quot;There's an awful lot of pessimism, a lot of disbelief, a lot of untrustworthiness,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone seems to be looking over their shoulders to see what's gaining on them.&quot;    As for the market's likely course, Mr. Ludtke shares the widely held view among analysts that stocks have entered a period in which prices will move within a narrow range. He says the potential for the industrial average to move past 2050 over the next few weeks appears to be limited, because of the market's overall lack of conviction.    However, he added that economically sensitive stocks and other areas with positive earnings reports and encouraging prospects are due for further gains. &quot;The focus appears to be such that it's a fairly selective market,&quot; he said.    Aluminum Co. of America jumped 3 to 46 1/2. Net income soared to $2.02 a share in the most recent quarter from 56 cents a year ago, and the company said it expects favorable market conditions and operating fundamentals to continue.    Other aluminum stocks also turned in strong performances, as did copper issues. Reynolds Metals surged 2 1/4 to 45 5/8, Alcan Aluminium rose 1 1/4 to 29 5/8, Phelps Dodge added 1/2 to 41 1/2 and Asarco gained 7/8 to 24 7/8.    Among other blue-chip companies reporting higher earnings, Merck gained 1/4 to 158, Minnesota Mining tacked on 3/8 to 58 1/2 and Philip Morris rose 1/2 to 87 1/2. Allied-Signal eased 7/8 to 30 3/4; the company reported net of 75 cents a share for the quarter, compared with net from continuing operations of 87 cents a year earlier.    Sears, Roebuck advanced 3/8 to 34 3/4. The retailer said it expects its 1988 net income to exceed 1987 earnings of $1.65 billion, or $4.35 a share. The estimate follows Sears's report that its first-quarter net fell to 47 cents a share from 75 cents.    Bethlehem Steel dropped 1 5/8 to 19 3/8. The company filed an offer of eight million common shares; it plans to use the proceeds primarily to fund part of its pension liabilities. Separately, the company said it would pay all dividends in arrears on its two preferred stock issues.    Honeywell climbed 1 1/8 to 68 7/8. The computer firm reported that its first-quarter net jumped to $1.36 a share from 96 cents a year ago. Other technology stocks got caught in the market's late retreat, including International Business Machines, which dropped 7/8 to 113 1/8.    Monsanto gained 1 3/8 to 81 7/8. The company's first-quarter net jumped to $2.86 a share from $1.76 a year earlier.    J.P. Stevens eased 3/8 to 67 3/4 as its competing suitors, Odyssey Partners and West Point-Pepperell, discussed a proposal that could lead to the company's acquisition for $68.50 a share. The price matches Odyssey's most recent offer for Stevens. Pepperell, which has offered $67 a share for the company through a partnership, gained 7/8 to 32 1/2.    On the American Stock Exchange, BSN Corp. jumped 1 5/8 to 9 1/2. The company said it signed an accord to sell the Cheerleader, Team Mates and Green River divisions of its garment unit for $42 million to Prospect Group, which closed unchanged at 7 1/4 in over-the-counter trading.    MCI Communications gained 1/2 to 12 3/4 in the OTC market. The company posted first-quarter net income from operations of 19 cents a share, up from seven cents in the year-ago quarter.    However, higher quarterly earnings weren't enough to produce gains in Microsoft, down 1/2 to 54 1/4, and Lotus Development, down 1 to 23 1/2. Microsoft's earnings jumped to 67 cents a share in its fiscal third quarter, ended March 31, from 35 cents a year earlier. First-quarter net at Lotus amounted to 40 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net of 31 cents.    Henley Manufacturing jumped 2 3/4 to 33 as Smith Barney issued a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation on the stock because of strong fundamentals and options held by the company to buy back most of its stock at a discount. </TEXT></DOC>
