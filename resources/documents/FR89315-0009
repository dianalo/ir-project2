Although polyoxyethylene-grafted polydimethylsiloxane has notbeen found to cause cancer, it may contain minute amounts of ethylene oxideand 1,4-dioxane as impurities from its production. These chemicals havebeen shown to cause cancer in test animals. Residual amounts of reactantsand byproducts, such as these chemicals, are commonly found as contaminantsin chemical products, including food additives.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety</ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in theFood Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative historyof the provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonable certainty thatno harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_andcannot_require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. No. 2284, 85th Cong., 2dSess. 4 (1958).) This definition of safety has been incorporated into FDA'sfood additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaneyclause of the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act(21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A))) provides further that no food additive shallbe deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by manor animal.In the past, FDA has often refused to approve the use of an additive thatcontained or was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenicchemical, even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to causecancer. The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientifictechnology and experience with risk assessment procedures make it possiblefor FDA to establish the safety of additives that contain carcinogenicchemicals but that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer.In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic impurity. Sincethat decision, FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis.An additive that has not been shown to cause cancer, but that containsa carcinogenic impurity, may properly be evaluated under the general safetyclause of the statute using risk assessment procedures to determine whetherthere is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposeduse of the additive.The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott</T3> v.<T3> FDA,</T3> 728 F. 2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list thiscolor additive, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejectedthe challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use </ITAG>FDA estimates that the petitioned use of polyethylene-grafted polydimethylsiloxanewill result in extremely low levels of exposure to this additive. The agencycalculated the estimated daily intake of the additive based on considerationssuch as the migration of the additive under the most severe intended useconditions and the types of food-contact articles that may contain thissubstance. The agency estimated the daily intake for the additive to be428 micrograms per person per day. FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to be necessary to determinethe safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels(Refs. 1 and 2), and has not required such testing here. However, the agencyhas reviewed available data from acute studies, subchronic rat and dogstudies, and mutagenicity tests with the additive. No adverse effects wereobserved in these studies, except for marginal histopathology effects atthe highest dose level in the subchronic dog study. Based upon the agency'sfurther review of this subchronic dog study, FDA determined that thereis an adequate margin of safety for the proposed use of the additive. Because polyoxyethylene-grafted polydimethylsiloxane has not been shownto cause cancer, the anticancer clause does not apply to it. However, FDAhas evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause,considering all available data and using risk assessment procedures toestimate the upper bound limit of risk presented by the carcinogenic chemicalsthat may be present as impurities in this additive. Based on this evaluation,the agency has concluded that the additive is safe under the proposed conditionsof use. The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other foodand color additives that contain carcinogenic impurities (see, e.g., 49FR 13018 and 13019; April 2, 1984). This risk evaluation of the carcinogenicimpurities ethylene dioxide and 1,4-dioxane has two aspects: (1) Assessmentof the worst case exposure to the impurities from the proposed use of theadditive and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassaysto the conditions of probable exposure to humans. A. 1,4-Dioxane Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining polyoxyethylene-grafted polydimethylsiloxane, and on the levelof 1,4-dioxane that may be present in the additive (Ref. 5), FDA estimatedthe hypothetical worst-case exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of thisadditive to be 0.18 microgram per person per day. The agency used datain a carcinogenesis bioassay on 1,4-dioxane conducted for the NationalCancer Institute (Ref. 4) to estimate the upper-bound level of lifetimehuman risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed useof the additive. The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxane indicated thatthe material was carcinogenic for female rats under the conditions of thestudy. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of squamouscell carcinomas and hepatocellullar tumors in female rats. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Cancer Assessment Committee(the committee) reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data availablein the literature and concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity weresupported by this information on 1,4-dioxane. The committee further concludedthat the 1,4-dioxane bioassay provided the appropriate basis on which tocalculate an estimate of the upper-bound level of lifetime human cancerrisk from potential exposure to 1,4-dioxane stemming from the proposeduse of the additive. The agency used a quantitative risk assessment procedure (linear proportionalmodel) to extrapolate from the dose used in the study with male rats (themost sensitive animals) to the very low doses encountered under the proposedconditions of use. This procedure is not likely to underestimate the actualrisk from very low doses and may, in fact, exaggerate it because the extrapolationmodels used are designed to estimate the maximum risk consistent with thedata. For this reason, the estimate can be used with confidence to determineto a reasonable certainty whether any harm will result from the proposedconditions and levels of use of the food additive.Based on a worst-case exposure of 0.18 microgram per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from potentialexposure to 1,4-dioxane from use of the subject additive is 6.3andmultiply;10^9or less than 1 in 158 million. (Ref. 6). Because of numerous conservatismsin the exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individual exposure to 1,4-dioxaneis expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake, andtherefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would be less. Thus, the agencyconcludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposureto 1,4-dioxane that might result from the proposed use of the additive.B. Ethylene OxideBased on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining polyoxyethylene-grafted polydimethylsiloxane, and on the levelof ethylene oxide that may be present in the additive, FDA estimated thehypothetical worst-case exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of thisadditive to be 0.18 microgram per person per day (Ref. 5). The agency useddata from a carcinogenesis bioassay on ethylene oxide conducted by theInstitute of Hygiene, University of Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany(Ref. 3), to estimate the upper-bound level of lifetime human risk fromexposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of this additive.The results of the bioassay on ethylene oxide indicated that this materialwas carcinogenic for female rats under the conditions of the study. Thetest material caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cellcarcinoma of the forestomach and carcinoma <T3>in situ </T3>of the glandular stomach.The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Cancer Assessment Committeereviewed this bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that the finding of carcinogenicity was supported by thisinformation on ethylene oxide. The committee further concluded that theethylene oxide bioassay provided an appropriate basis on which to estimatean upper-bound level of human risk from potential exposure to ethyleneoxide stemming from the proposed use of the additive.Based on a worst-case exposure of 0.18 microgram per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound limit of individual lifetime risk from potentialexposure to ethylene oxide from the use of the subject additive is 3.3andmultiply;10^7or less than 1 in 3 million (Ref. 6). Because of numerous conservatismsin the exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individual exposure to ethyleneoxide is expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake,and therefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would be less. Thus, theagency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from theexposure to ethylene oxide that might result from the proposed use of theadditive.C. Need for SpecificationsThe agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary tocontrol the amount of 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide in the food additive.The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxanemay be expected to remain as imputities following production of the additive,the agency would not expect these impurities to become components of foodat other than extremely small levels; and (2) the upper-bound limit oflifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even under worst-caseassumptions, is very low, less than 1 in 158 million for 1,4-dioxane andless than 1 in 3 million for ethylene oxide.D. Conclusion on SafetyFDA has evaluated the available data and other relevant material and concludesthat the proposed use of the additive in olefin polymers is safe, and thatandSection;177.1520 should be amended in paragraph (b) as set forth below.In accordance with andSection;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and theevidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment,may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
