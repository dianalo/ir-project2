Lee (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> USG </CO><IN> TNM CON </IN><TEXT>   Desert Partners L.P. said it completed the financing arrangements required for its $42-a-share hostile tender offer for control of USG Corp.    The Midland, Texas-based limited partnership said Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. has agreed to commit $200 million of its own funds in bridge-loan financing for the $1.64 billion offer, which is for 39 million USG shares, a 76% stake. Such loans typically are refinanced by the subsequent sale of high-yield debt securities.    Desert Partners also said it retained Merrill as a financial adviser for the takeover offer, which is slated to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday.    As part of the agreement, Merrill would have the right to purchase equity in the resulting company. Both Desert Partners and Merrill declined to disclose details, which are expected to be made public today. But Merrill's equity stake will be based on a formula that applies to Elders Investments Ltd. and Elders Finance Group, the Australian entities that previously committed to buy $300 million of Desert Partners' debt securities.    Under terms Desert Partners disclosed in a filing earlier this month, the Elders entities would receive warrants to purchase 22% of the resulting company's shares. Under the same formula, Merrill would get warrants to purchase 14.7% of the shares.    While the Merrill agreement is another sign of investment banks' willingness to take on more takeover risks in hopes of gaining more profits, some merger specialists said it isn't as controversial or unusual as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s hostile bid with Beazer PLC to acquire Koppers Co. First, Merrill would be taking less of a stake than Shearson would in Koppers. Second, by using warrants, which have been employed in other mergers, the Merrill stake would be indirect.    When Beazer expressed doubt about its ability to take on the additional debt needed to acquire Koppers, Shearson agreed to take a 46% equity stake in a group that would seek control of the company. Beazer took a 49% stake, and a British investment bank took the remainder.    In addition to Merrill and the Elders entities, Desert Partners said Wells Fargo Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank arranged a $1.4 billion bank financing.    Desert Partners, which is led by oil men Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown, started its pursuit of USG last year when it disclosed a 9.8% stake in the Chicago-based building products company. USG has rejected the offer as inadequate and is skirmishing in federal court with the limited partnership over whether to redeem its poison-pill anti-takeover plan. A USG spokesman declined comment on the limited partnership's financing moves.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, USG shares closed at $39.75, up $1.75. </TEXT></DOC>
