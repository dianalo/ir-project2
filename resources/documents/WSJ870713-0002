The rating concern cited the creation of a trust in which government securities were designated to retire the debt issue. A double-B-plus rating was affirmed on $75 million of the Houston-based maker and marketer of oil field tools and equipment. Sandamp;P said Cameron's credit quality remains hampered by weakness in oil tool markets but said sales of forged products continue to show stability. Sandamp;P also said Cameron's profitability in the near term will be limited at best and that losses are a strong possibility. In the longer term, it said, oil tool operations are solidly positioned to benefit from an expected rebound in offshore markets and the eventual need for new gas drilling. The company said the change in the debt rating was expected.    ---   CONNECTICUT NATURAL GAS CORP. -- Sandamp;P raised its rating on this Hartford, Conn.-based natural gas utility's first mortgage bonds to single-A-minus from triple-B-plus. About $76 million of long-term debt is affected. The company's single-A-2 commercial paper rating was affirmed. The rating concern cited a regulatory ruling that it said should allow earnings-protection measures to be maintained at &quot;strong levels.&quot; State regulators reduced the company's authorized return on common equity to 12.6% from 15.9% but didn't order any rate reduction.    ---   NATIONAL HEALTHCARE INC. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it put its single-B-2 rating on about $30 million of the Dothan, Ala.-based hospital chain's subordinated debt under review for possible downgrade, citing recent &quot;unfavorable business developments&quot; for the company. Moody's also said the company's balance sheet is highly leveraged, with a &quot;sizable&quot; amount of senior bank debt. A spokesman said Moody's apparently was reacting to the company's second-quarter loss of $8 million, which included pre-tax write-offs of $9.1 million, and its current non-compliance with certain covenants in its bank credit agreement.    ---   SOUTHLAND FINANCIAL CORP. -- Moody's said it placed under review for a possible downgrade the Ba-2 rating on $200 million of first mortgage notes of this Irving, Texas-based real estate company's Las Colinas Corp. unit. The rating concern said it will review the unit's ability to service the principal and interest on the 12.5% notes due 1992 while Southland Financial seeks to restructure its bank debt. The company had no comment on the Moody's action. </TEXT></DOC>
