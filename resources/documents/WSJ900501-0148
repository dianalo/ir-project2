Some companies publish more than one set ofasset-allocation recommendations. Within reason, they maypick which set they want to be judged by, provided theyspecify in advance. Two companies, PaineWebber Inc. andGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co., recently changed the asset-allocationblend tracked in the study.</LP><TEXT>   PaineWebber formerly used a theoretical asset-allocationmodel developed by Edward Kerschner and Charles Pradilla. Itsneutral reading calls for a 33.3% position in each of threeassets, stocks, bonds, and cash. As of Jan. 31, PaineWebberasked to be judged, instead, on its advice for a typicalbalanced portfolio, in which stocks normally have heavierweight.   Goldman Sachs, previously judged on its advice to largepension funds, has asked to be judged as of March 31 on itsadvice for a smaller, aggressive pension fund. StrategistSteven Einhorn said he believes this advice more closelyapproximates what individual investors should follow.   Other companies with more than one asset-allocation blendare tracked as follows:   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is judged on itsrecommendations for a &quot;small, aggressive fund&quot;; A.G. Edwardsandamp; Sons Inc. on a &quot;growth and income&quot; portfolio; Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co. on an &quot;individual balanced&quot; portfolio, andRaymond, James andamp; Associates Inc. on advice to &quot;young urbanprofessionals.&quot;   The study disregards the cost of trading, mainly to makethe results comparable to market averages. In practice, ofcourse, people who often adjust their investment blends mayincur high commissions.   Each house's advice is mirrored in a theoreticalportfolio. Holdings are adjusted whenever the advice changes,and also on the last day of each month, to keep assets in therecommended ratio.   Investments are assumed to do as well as the followingindexes: the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index for stocks;the Merrill Lynch corporate and government master bond indexfor bonds; 90-day Treasury bills for cash; the NationalCouncil of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries/Frank RussellCo. index for real estate; and the average monthly price ofgold for tangible assets.
