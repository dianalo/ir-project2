In Thailand, the country's top military leader said Bangkok willstop aiding the guerrillas after it has confirmed that Vietnamesesoliders have indeed left the country, and after all other foreignaid is halted.   Relief officials, meanwhile, said a large Khmer Rouge refugeecamp just inside the Thai border was shelled from Cambodia,presumably by government forces.   The Khmer Rouge reported a new offensive on the strategicCambodian city of Pailin and contended Vietnamese soldiers stillwere defending the city. Vietnam denied the allegation, insistingit withdrew the last of its troops Tuesday.   Officers from Vietnam's 5th Division, one of the most active infighting in Cambodia, said they had achieved all their goals beforewithdrawing from their Communist neighbor after a 10-yearoccupation.   ``The difficulties which our division faced in the Cambodian warwere very minor compared with those faced in the war withAmerica,'' said Bui Buc Tran, deputy commander of the 5th Division.   ``In the American war, we had the philosophy that one doesn'twin because of equipment and supplies, but because one's cause isjust. I think the Cambodian people also have a just cause in tryingto prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said.   About 2,000 of the withdrawn troops are being housed on thisbase near Tay Ninh, about 35 miles from the Cambodia border.   At the United Nations in New York, foreign ministers RolandDumas of France and Ali Alatas of Indonesia on Wednesday welcomedVietnam's withdrawal but asked new diplomatic negotiations to reacha comprehensive peace settlement.   France and Indonesia are leaders of the International Conferenceon Cambodia, which broke up in Paris in August after the warringparties failed to agree on a peace plan.   The Khmer Rouge are loosely allied to two non-communistguerrilla groups that have been fighting the Phnom Penh governmentand the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and toppled aKhmer Rouge government.   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia from 1975-78. Duringthat time, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died from KhmerRouge executions, famine and civil unrest.   After its invasion, Vietnam helped the pro-Hanoi government itinstalled in Phnom Penh battle the Khmer Rouge and two otherguerrilla groups armed by China and granted sanctuaries insideThailand.   ``If the Thai government stops its support of the guerrillas,the Cambodian government will have no problem ending theinsurgency,'' Tran said. ``We are completely satisfied that theCambodian people now have the full ability to defend themselves.''   In Bangkok, Gen. Pat Akkanibut of Thailand's Supreme MilitaryCommand told The Associated Press that Thailand's backing wouldcontinue until Vietnam's withdrawal could be proved and externalmilitary aid from all sides halted. The Soviet Union is the majorweapons supplier for Cambodian government troops.   Fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border has intensified inrecent weeks during the Vietnam pullout.   The Khmer Rouge radio said its guerrillas have begun a newoffensive on the gem-trading center of Pailin in western Cambodiaand were shelling the town from all sides.   The guerrilla radio, the Voice of the National Army ofDemocratic Kampuchea, has claimed battle successes around Pailin.The town is northwest of Phnom Penh and close to the Thai frontier.   The radio charged that Hanoi has sent 3,000 troops to helpdefend Pailin.   Vietnamese military spokesman Thai denied the claims butacknowledged guerrilla forces had taken some territory.   Hundreds of shells pelted a Khmer Rouge refugee camp near theCambodian border Wednesday, forcing thousands of refugees to fleeor take cover, a relief official said.</TEXT></DOC>
