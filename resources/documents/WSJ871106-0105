Washington's intervention in the battle for the prestigious M.I.T. contract appeared likely to aggravate U.S.-Japanese trade tensions, in which supercomputers have been a major issue. Analysts also said the development indicates further difficulties for Japanese efforts to break into the U.S. supercomputer market, now dominated by Cray Research Inc., Minneapolis.    John M. Deutch, M.I.T.'s provost, said U.S. government officials indicated &quot;it would not be in the nation's best interest to obtain the machines from Japan.&quot; M.I.T. had solicited proposals from five companies, including two selling Japanese machines.    According to industry and M.I.T. sources, the front-runner for the contract was Honeywell-NEC Supercomputers Inc. Honeywell Inc. and Nippon Electric Corp. of Japan each own 50% of the company.    Rather than buy more expensive U.S. alternatives, M.I.T. decided to cancel the procurement. Others who had submitted proposals for the contract, worth about $7.5 million, included Cray, International Business Machines Corp., the E.T.A. Systems unit of Control Data Corp. and Amdahl Corp., 46% owned by Fujitsu Ltd.; Amdahl's proposal was based on a Fujitsu machine.    The U.S. government and American computer makers have long complained that Japan has denied U.S. companies access to Japan's supercomputer market. In an agreement with U.S. trade officials last August, Japan adopted measures that would simplify the bidding and procurement procedures for supercomputers in Japan.    Mr. Deutch said the decision not to proceed was influenced by an Oct. 13 letter to M.I.T.'s president, Paul Gray, from Bruce Smart, then-acting Secretary of Commerce. In the letter, Mr. Smart said he understood that M.I.T. was considering purchasing a supercomputer from NEC, and &quot;I am writing to inform you that we have no objection to the acquisition of a foreign-produced supercomputer.    &quot;However,&quot; the letter continued, &quot;you should be aware that imported products may be subject to U.S. anti-dumping duty proceedings. . . . If it is determined that the product is being sold at less than fair value and that it is injuring a U.S. industry, then anti-dumping duties would be imposed.&quot;    Mr. Smart was traveling yesterday and was unavailable for comment, but a Commerce Department spokeswoman said, &quot;We didn't threaten anyone.&quot; The letter, she said, was in response to an M.I.T. inquiry about U.S. trade laws.    Mr. Deutch, however, said the letter left &quot;not the slightest doubt in my mind&quot; that if M.I.T. bought a Japanese machine, &quot;there would be an anti-dumping suit brought.&quot; In informing bidders of its decision, M.I.T. noted that all the campus-based research projects that would use the computers were federally funded.    Within days of Mr. Smart's letter, of which bidders were made aware, both Honeywell-NEC and Amdahl-Fujitsu voluntarily withdrew their proposals. &quot;We believe it wasn't worth it for us to get caught in a long fight with all the media attention,&quot; said James Berrett, chairman of Honeywell-NEC.    Honeywell-NEC, based in Burlington, Mass., submitted a proposal for M.I.T. to pay a fee for use of an NEC SX-2 series supercomputer. The fee would have been $1.2 million in the first year, rising to $2 million in the fifth and last year of the contract.    Those figures, low for use of a supercomputer, were apparently difficult for others to match. Mr. Deutch said that although no final determination had been made before the project was canceled, &quot;it would be a pretty good guess&quot; that one of the Japanese machines would have been chosen.    The contract had &quot;been a really high-level battle between NEC and Cray,&quot; said Jeffrey Canin, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco. &quot;This could be an indication of future prospects for Japanese makers.&quot;    A spokesman for Cray described the M.I.T. decision as &quot;good news.&quot; &quot;Assuming the bidding does open up again, it means there's room for technical considerations and not considerations based purely on price.&quot; The spokesman said it would have been impossible for Cray to install and operate a complete supercomputer system at the prices M.I.T. wanted to pay.    Mr. Deutch, however, said M.I.T. now plans to apply for federal funds for a more ambitious project -- a research center that would use several supercomputers for the study of engineering and scientific problems.    All of the machines would be U.S.-made, Mr. Deutch said. </TEXT></DOC>
