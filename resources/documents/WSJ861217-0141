The interpreter's rusty 1971 Volkswagen Beetle recently failed a federal auto inspection, so he can't drive it.    But he isn't about to run over to the bank for a car loan. He would rather save up and buy a used car next spring or repair the old one. &quot;I would definitely not consider borrowing money to buy a car,&quot; says the father of two. &quot;Maybe for a house but not for a car.&quot; Meanwhile, he says, it is &quot;better to walk than to borrow.&quot;    Mr. Alexandru's attitude reflects the view of high-saving, low-debt West Germany and the rest of Europe. It is an attitude that has helped Germany keep inflation and interest rates relatively low while the economy grows steadily, if not spectacularly. But this caution has also meant that even under the near-ideal conditions of the past year, Europe's consumers haven't pulled the world out of the economic doldrums by snapping up lots of American exports or buying enough home-produced goods to create more jobs.    They are no more likely to do so in coming months, and that could present a major problem for the U.S. Washington has been calling for West Germany and other European governments to give consumers more pocket money, through tax cuts, and to coax them to borrow more through lower interest rates. But even if the governments act, the extra money is likely to go straight into the bank, not into cash registers.    &quot;The good news may already be behind us&quot; on European consumer spending, says J. Paul Horne, an international economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in Paris. Spurred by wage increases that have surpassed price increases, private consumption during the first nine months of this year rose 3.5% to 4% from a year earlier in Europe, he says, and a little more in West Germany, the best showing since 1973.    But this rise, while welcome, didn't do much good. West Germany's gross national product will probably grow only 2.5% this year, according to the latest estimates, and Europe as a whole will do little better. This growth rate isn't enough to create more jobs in Europe or to have any pull on the U.S. economy.    And Europe's consumers aren't likely to continue even this modest &quot;spree.&quot; Oil prices, rising from lows in the summer, could reignite inflation, reduce real wage increases and cause governments to tighten credit. &quot;We've seen a special, one-time boost to spending power,&quot; Mr. Horne says.    Most economists agree that consumer spending, the biggest single element in any country's gross national product, can be a powerful force in encouraging growth. They also agree that in Europe, there are myriad obstacles that keep spending from being as vigorous a stimulant as it might be. In fact, some economists joke that what the world's economy needs most is a consumer transplant: free-spending Americans reviving European economies while frugal Europeans ease America's over-indebtedness.    Short of that happening, however, certain characteristics will continue to hamstring spending here. Fear of credit, for instance, is Europe-wide. In a study conducted for MasterCard, 45% of Europeans in six countries strongly agreed that &quot;to buy anything other than a house on credit is unwise.&quot; Only 23% of Americans responded similarly. And a huge 74% of the Europeans surveyed said that credit cards &quot;make it too easy to overspend,&quot; compared with 21% of Americans.    The would-be European shopper also faces a discouraging variety of customs, laws and taboos. Stores often aren't allowed to open at night or on Sunday. Bank hours are even less convenient, and cash dispensers and credit cards have yet to proliferate. Many shops actively discourage browsing. In some countries the extent and the timing of discount sales are government controlled. So, too, is television and print advertising, which generally isn't permitted to make price comparisons. Merchants may be forced by law to keep their prices artificially high.    &quot;There are different concerns in Europe than in the U.S.,&quot; says Michael Montague, the chairman of Britain's National Consumer Council. He says that &quot;the national mood&quot; in England would seem to require the sweeping away of all restraints on store hours, including the ban on Sunday trading, &quot;but, on the other hand, people don't want the tranquillity of their Sunday disturbed.&quot;    In France, shopping for fresh bread on Sunday is permitted, but past fears of price gouging have led to restrictions on competition that are only now being dismantled. Even so, the prices of medicines and a few other products will be kept down, and the prices of books and tobacco will be kept up.    But it is in West Germany, Europe's biggest economy, that the consumer faces the most hurdles to spending. A close look at German consumer behavior illustrates why economic stimulation doesn't always work as it should.    One problem is demographics: West Germany's population has fallen by more than one million since 1975, with the decline as steep as 250,000 in one year, or about the population of Bonn, the capital city. Such a drop translates into as much as $650 million in lost retail sales a year, roughly the annual volume of 36 of the 162 stores run by Karstadt AG, the nation's largest retailer.    Worse, the declining population spends less than Americans do. For each dollar that an American consumer spends, a West German will spend anywhere from 55 to 70 cents, according to various studies. Germans also trail the Norwegians, the Swiss and even the Japanese as per capita spenders.    Germans &quot;distrust consumption,&quot; says economist Gernot Nerb. &quot;They really believe in the saving ethic, that it's just not right to consume too much,&quot; he adds.    Germans save more and borrow less in part because interest on installment debt isn't tax-deductible, as it is in the U.S. After World War II, Germany needed to finance its reconstruction, so the federal government took steps to encourage its citizens to save. Many of those tax incentives are still in effect today. So, too, is the lobbying apparatus. Private groups such as the Society for the Protection of the German Saver regularly advocate ever higher savings rates, even though German rates already tend to be at least three times as high as those in the U.S.    The attitude toward savings also reflects insecurity about economic conditions influenced by memories of hardships. Germans have seen their currency collapse twice in this century, after each world war.    &quot;I vividly recall the old money being thrown away,&quot; says Joachim Bargon, a chemistry professor who was nine years old when the new German currency was established in 1948. &quot;My parents lost everything they had.&quot; Mr. Bargon, who says a stay in the U.S. has made his spending behavior &quot;more liberal&quot; than that of the typical German, nonetheless still saves heavily and shuns credit.    When he bought a new $400,000 home two years ago, Mr. Bargon paid about 70% of the purchase price in cash, tying up nearly all his personal savings. Paying cash makes sense, he says, when mortgage rates are about 8% and banks pay a top interest rate of 3%.    It is also safe. &quot;Seeing your parents in a basement, with no shelter over their heads and nothing to eat -- those memories stay with you always,&quot; he says. &quot;You feel less secure -- and you save more to compensate for your insecurity.&quot; As for borrowing, &quot;there's a stigma against it,&quot; he says. &quot;It's something that one doesn't do if he is of a certain social rank.&quot;    Perhaps because of this stigma, when they do spend, Germans prefer to spend cash. Volkswagen sells half of its cars in Germany for cash, compared with only 5% in the U.S. Credit accounted for less than 1% of Karstadt's $3.1 billion in sales last year; 62% of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s $21.5 billion in volume was on credit.    In West Germany, about 70% to 85% of consumer purchases are paid in cash, according to various estimates; the corresponding figure in the U.S. is about 20%. There are only about 1.2 million credit cards in Germany, fewer than in many Third World countries. &quot;As far as most Germans are concerned,&quot; says Juergen Aumueller, a senior vice president at American Express Co. in Frankfurt, &quot;use of credit is inflationary.&quot;    Many businesses have tried to get Germans to behave more like Americans, usually to no avail. Chase Manhattan Corp., for example, established a consumer-finance company in the 1970s, called Family Bank, with several dozen branch offices throughout West Germany. The intent was to lend money to consumers American-style, but the company was a failure and Chase closed it after a few years. &quot;They tried to bring the American concept of debt to the German market,&quot; says a German banker. &quot;It was quite a bloodbath.&quot;    Even spending cash isn't easy. Germany has the smallest number of cash-dispensing automatic teller machines per capita of 14 major industrial countries, according to a recent survey. And when a customer withdraws money from his bank account, he often pays a service charge.    The West German consumer also doesn't have much time to shop. Under a regulation called the &quot;Ladenschlussgesetz,&quot; Monday through Friday every store in West Germany must close at exactly 6:30 p.m. Two years ago Bremen businessman Jochen Pfaff led a revolt of local shopkeepers; they kept their stores open until 11 p.m. &quot;It has to be the stupidest law in the entire world,&quot; a frustrated Mr. Pfaff says. But threatened with jail sentences and fines of up to $50,000 each, the group ended its rebellion.    Even among retailers who would undoubtedly benefit from longer shopping hours, there is a widespread conviction that German shopping behavior is immutable. &quot;I don't think there is any rational reason {for the rules}, but even if you changed the law, it wouldn't lead to a higher level of consumer spending,&quot; says Gunter Kayser, who runs a clothing boutique in Essen. &quot;It's a question of habit.&quot;    Change is coming slowly on some fronts, however. Several department-store chains are testing their own credit cards, and Karstadt is attempting to persuade Germans to browse. German shoppers tend to look for specific items and hence spend considerably less time in a store than Americans do. &quot;The typical German views shopping as a chore,&quot; says Dietrich Jacobi, Karstadt's director of sales training, who notes that the almost daily routine of shopping for groceries has probably reinforced this mentality.    To get customers to spend more time -- and money -- in its stores, Karstadt now features live entertainment. It has redesigned about half its stores to incorporate a &quot;loop&quot; concept, which leads customers from one department to another as they try to get out, and it is training its 40,000-person sales staff to encourage more browsing.    &quot;I myself don't believe that we can change a customer's behavior,&quot; says Mr. Jacobi, &quot;but perhaps we can shape it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
