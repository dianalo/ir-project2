So we were pleased,during a stay at a rural bed-and-breakfast recently, to discover a hoard ofmagazines dating from the 1940s and 50s.andP;  Browsing through old SaturdayEvening Posts, we were struck by the advertisements for cars and appliancesthat conveyed real uniqueness or even personality.andP;  Those were the days, wethought, when it was possible to bring out a new product with a porthole or aline of chrome and convince people that such things mattered.andM;The copywriter's job is a lot harder now that so many products have becomecommodities, manufactured all over the world with little variation in design,features, or performance.andP;  That's why we get car ads that are all aboutglamour or adventure or solitude instead of about cars.andP;  But nobody has aharder marketing job these days than a company selling personal computers.andM;The almighty industry standard - covering everything from operating systemand central processor to keyboard, storage system, and display - turns out tobe a double-edged sword.andP;  Standards have brought prices down at abreathtaking pace and made it safe for millions of customers to invest incomputer equipment.andP;  But standards also make it virtually impossible formanufacturers to differentiate their products and keep margins atsatisfactory levels.andP;  When even Apple Computer and IBM start selling throughdiscount chains - and have to cooperate in order to rise above the crowd -it's pretty clear that the commodity era is here to stay.andM;With the desktop market slowing and becoming hopelessly generic, portableproducts would seem to offer an opportunity both for growth and forinnovation.andP;  In fact, Compaq's first and highly successful effort to becreative within the IBM PC standard, back in 1982, was a 28-lb.andP;  portable - areal achievement for its day.andP;  The growth part is certainly true.andP;  Most ofthe market research we've seen on the subject puts current growth of portablepersonal computers at 30% or better in unit terms, and the notebooksubcategory is accelerating far faster.andM;Even in notebooks, successful product differentiation has been hard to comeby.andP;  Much of what we see on the market today looks very much like Compaq'sLTE series, for example.andP;  But we think that the advent of pen-entrytechnology, freeing product designers and their customers from theconstraints of keyboards as well as from the entanglement of plugs and wires,has the potential to start the creative juices flowing again.andP;  If so, ifunique products can find profitable markets, the pen computer segment couldbecome an oasis of high gross margins in a business that looks increasinglylike a low-margin desert.andM;History lessonandM;On the evidence that's accumulated to date, it won't be particularly easy.andO;Some very clever folks, usually quite well-financed, have tried without muchsuccess to break through the look-alike barrier in portable computers.andP;  We'dhate to guess how much money has been lost in such efforts.andP;  Going back tosuch catastrophic startups as Osborne Computer and Gavilan Computer and suchmisguided corporate projects as the Workslate, an early notebook developedand killed by Convergent Technologies (now part of Unisys), the portablesblack hole has swallowed tens of millions of dollars invested in the name ofinnovation.andM;Playing with blocksandM;The fault has not usually been a failure of imagination.andP;  More often, specialfeatures that might have won market acceptance were overwhelmed bydevelopment or manufacturing problems.andP;  We've identified six importantapproaches to product differentiation in portable computers, many of whichmight still serve as the basis for pen-entry products.andM;MODULARITY - The idea of designing a computer that snaps together as easilyas a set of Lego blocks has been around for some time and ought to beparticularly appropriate for pen systems.andP;  Unfortunately, the proponents sofar haven't much to show for their cleverness.andP;  Agilis, a well-financedstartup, based its appeal partly on the idea of letting users tailorcomputers to their needs with modular components called &quot;slices.&quot; Dynabook,an even bigger venture capital magnet, also used a compelling modular design.andM;Both companies ran into manufacturing problems and delays that dashed theirinvestors' hopes but didn't necessarily invalidate their strategies.andP;  We'vealready seen the first modular pen computers.andP;  NCR's NotePad, for example,has an adapter bar that plugs in to provide parallel and serialcommunications.andP;  Detachable keyboards are another obvious modular ploy we'llsee more of.andP;  And, of course, the concept of central processors that snap ineasily at upgrade time seems to be catching on across the industry.andM;The caveat here is that it is generally more expensive to build a modularproduct than a one-box unit.andP;  Unless customers can be persuaded to pay apremium for modularity, the concept won't work.andM;COMMUNICATIONS - It's pretty obvious that the ability to communicate fromafar is, or ought to be, the hallmark of any portable computer.andP;  Never mindthat Agilis was never able to get its spread-spectrum radio link to workcorrectly or that GRiD Systems, Agilis Founder John Ellenby's previousventure, was slightly ahead of its time in stressing communications.andO;Wireless communications, whether using radio, microwave, or infraredtechnology, will be an important part of the computing landscape in the nearfuture, and the ability to take advantage of that trend should be animportant competitive issue for pen systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
