Our love for java seems insatiable.;   The SouthBay's newest coffee house is Great Bear Coffee andamp; Los Osos Cafe, in Los Gatos.The cafe has a cute, slightly manufactured coziness, with exposed air ducts,shiny black girders and bare brick walls lined with photographs of jazz greatsincluding Pharaoh Saunders and Leon Thomas (a wonderful mix of jazz is in theair).  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WAKE UP TO MORE SOURCES FOR COFFEE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Tasting Notes  </MEMO><TEXT>     Cappuccino ($1.60) is textbook quality. One of three, sometimes four, housecoffees (75 cents, 60 cents with your own mug) might be a luscious FrenchRoast, milder than what you'd find at some other roasters. Ditto for theViennese blend of beans I bought ($7.10). There are 17 beans or blends fromColombian French roast ($6.35) to Kona Extra Fancy ($12.95).;   The food is acasual mix of salads, sandwiches and pizzas ($3.75 to $6.65). I had adelicious, if messy, Greek sandwich of roasted peppers and feta cheese on abaguette. First-rate baked goods come from several local bakeries. Fullbreakfasts (home-fries, the whole bit) are served from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.,daily.;      Great Bear Coffee andamp; Los Osos Cafe, 19 N. Santa Cruz Ave., LosGatos; (408) 395-8607. Open daily, 6 a.m.-11 p.m.; (hbox);   Just around thecorner, the Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Company, last year's &quot;Best of San Jose&quot;winner, has expanded. The retail operation has moved next door, with more roomfor equipment, tastings and lectures. For a limited time, it has some rarecoffees including organic sun-dried extra fancy Kona ($16 a pound). A newespresso bar goes in this week where the old retail space was located. It willhave three barista stations where all manner of coffee drinks will be made,including a special espresso with lemon or orange granita (Italian-styleshaved ice).;   Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Company, 101 W. Main St., Los Gatos,(408) 354-3263.; (hbox);    Still looking for Peet's Anniversary Blend coffee?Sorry, it's gone. Peet's vice president Jim Reynolds said the special blend ofGuatemalan, Yemen Mocha and Sulawesi beans, created to celebrate the company's25th year, was more popular than anyone anticipated. Peet's still carries theGuatemalan and Yemen Mocha beans, but the Sulawesi was a special batch that nolonger exists (Peet's carries other Sulawesi beans). Too bad. The AnniversaryBlend was a superb brew, nutty and slightly sweet. And unlike most of Peet'scoffee, didn't make your hair stand on end. But, take heart. Reynolds isworking on another blend with similar characteristics. And a special HolidayBlend will be out the week before Thanksgiving.; (hbox);   Like a touch of oakin your coffee beans? Mr. Espresso, a coffee roaster in Oakland, roasts coffeebeans in ovens fired with seasoned oak. The Neapolitan I tried ($6.39 for 12ounces) makes a very good all-purpose coffee, though I think it's a bit lightfor an espresso. It also comes decaffeinated. Available at Roger's Deli inMountain View and The Coffee Connection in Scott's Valley.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Sam Gugino column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911002  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  503  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 2, 199100276089,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
