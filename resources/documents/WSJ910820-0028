The overthrow of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev andthe scenes of tanks rumbling through Moscow sent shock wavesthrough global financial markets frightened by the prospectof a Soviet civil war. Stock markets plunged; oil pricessurged upward. The frantic market activity was reminiscent ofa year ago, when Saddam Hussein's march into Kuwait roiledmost markets and helped plunge the U.S. into recession.</LP><TEXT>   Amid signs that the U.S. recovery was already faltering,the news from the Soviet Union raised fears of a slide backinto recession. &quot;It's a shock to the system at a time whenthe system is already under considerable strain,&quot; says GeorgeSoros, an investment fund manager with ties to the SovietUnion and Eastern Europe.   At this point, however, the damage seems largelypsychological. In raw economic terms, the Soviet Union'simportance to the rest of the world is relatively small. Evenbefore the coup, the Soviet economy was in a free fall, andits trade and investment relations with other countries --and particularly the U.S. -- were marginal. The major economywith the most at stake is Germany's.   Nevertheless, yesterday's market reaction shows that thecourse of the Soviet Union is still important to the worldeconomy. For global investors, President Gorbachev had cometo symbolize the end of the Cold War, the world-wide movetoward freer markets and greater demand for Western products.His fall from power now throws those trends into question andcould seriously undermine the confidence of investors,businessmen and consumers.   Just how serious that blow will be depends on what happensnext in the Soviet Union. Dwayne Andreas, chairman of ArcherDaniels Midland Corp., who often visits the Soviet Union,says it's too early to determine the economic effects. &quot;Itain't over 'til it's over,&quot; he insists.   Yesterday's turmoil pushed down the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage 69.99 points, or 2.4%; it closed at 2898.03. On mostforeign exchanges, the damage was worse. The news first hitFar Eastern markets, where Japanese stocks fell 5.95%. Later,the German market led the drop, plunging 9.4%. The Londonstock market, the world's third-largest, fared relativelywell; bargain hunting by institutional investors held itsdecline to 3.1%.   Foreign currencies fell, too, as the dollar resumed itstraditional role as a haven in times of internationalturmoil. By late New York trading, the dollar was trading at1.8245 marks, up 3.4%, despite central banks' heavyintervention to hold it down. Petroleum prices initially roseas much as $2.70 a barrel on fears of disruption in Sovietoil production and ended the day more than $1 a barrel higherin most markets.   If civil war breaks out in the Soviet Union, as some arepredicting, turmoil will dog world financial markets for sometime. Stocks would almost certainly fall, oil prices wouldjump, and the capital flight from Europe could send currencymarkets into further disarray.   &quot;I normally take the curmudgeonly view and say that theworld will always be the same,&quot; says Gerald Holtham,economist with Shearson Lehman Brothers in London. &quot;But thistime, I'm different -- this could be the beginning of civilwar in what is the world's second-largest power.&quot;   Eventually, the Federal Reserve and other central bankscould even be forced to cut interest rates in an effort torescue the markets and the world economy. &quot;This increases theodds of lower interest rates in the U.S. and Japan,&quot; saysDavid Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services inChicago. Mr. Soros agrees: &quot;I expect the authorities to dotheir utmost to countermand the effects of this by loweringinterest rates and intervening to stabilize exchange rates.&quot;   Yesterday, authorities were mostly putting their actionson hold. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and New York FedPresident Gerald Corrigan both postponed separate plans tovisit the Soviet Union. And the World Bank put off plans toconsider at a meeting today creating a $25 million to $30million trust fund to provide technical assistance to theSoviet Union.   The Federal Reserve's policy committee, which meets today,is also likely to take a wait-and-see stance. Under thecautious leadership of Chairman Alan Greenspan, the Fed hasavoided taking action in the midst of uncertainty.   The biggest question facing all of them is whether the newSoviet leaders will succeed in restoring order or whetherwidespread fighting will erupt. Also unclear is how the newSoviet junta planned to deal with the country's staggeringeconomic problems.   In a long statement, the coup leaders expressed somesympathy for the economic reforms that Mr. Gorbachev hadbegun to pursue. They pledged support for &quot;privateenterprise,&quot; for instance, saying they would &quot;grant thenecessary opportunities for developing production.&quot;   But they also made it clear that they wanted economicreform to be controlled at the top, without the politicaldecentralization that Mr. Gorbachev had accepted. Moreover,their plans seemed to rely largely on the discredited Sovietformula of enforcing worker &quot;discipline&quot; rather than creatinga true market economy.   All of the immediate economic decrees issued by thecommittee stressed central-government commands to improve theeconomy. For instance, the leaders ordered ministries tooffer garden plots to city dwellers; they even micromanagedthe decree, specifying that the plots be no more than 0.15hectare in size.   Economic experts say yesterday's events would almostcertainly worsen the Soviet Union's economic plight. &quot;Theseguys want to go back to the good old system,&quot; says StanleyFischer, economics professor at Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology and former chief economist at the World Bank. Ifthe coup leaders stay in power, Mr. Fischer adds, he suspects&quot;they'll be back on the reform track after some period ofdiscovering you can't put Humpty Dumpty together again.&quot;   Meanwhile, however, the turmoil in the Soviet Union couldinflict considerable damage elsewhere in the world. Here's alook at the possible consequences:                                                                                                          United States                                                                                                          In some ways, the U.S. economy is well insulated from theSoviet economy. Trade is tiny: The U.S. exported only $3billion worth of goods to the Soviet Union last year --mostly agricultural products. That's far below the $113billion the U.S. exports to Western Europe -- and roughlyequal to U.S. exports to Venezuela.   Moreover, U.S. businessmen and bankers have been extremelyreluctant to invest in the Soviet Union and so have little atstake there. The biggest potential U.S. investment -- a planby Chevron Corp. to develop a giant oil field insouth-central U.S.S.R. -- has been bogged down in Sovietpolitical problems.   Similarly, U.S. banks hold little of the Soviet Union's$60 billion of outstanding debt and so stand to lose littlefrom Soviet economic problems. Recently, U.S. banks evenrefused to help finance $1.5 billion in grain credits for theSoviet Union, even though the credits were largely guaranteedby the U.S. government.   Moreover, Fabian Linden, who heads the consumer researchcenter at the Conference Board, says U.S. consumers areunlikely to be much affected by developments in the SovietUnion. &quot;This is an event that is too divorced from the livesof the everyday citizen,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not like the GulfWar, which raised the prospects of loss of life, higher gasprices and a big budget deficit.&quot;   And U.S. financial markets may even benefit some from thefact that the U.S. is considered a safe haven in a crisis.   Nevertheless, many economists and businessmen believe thatthe turmoil in the Soviet Union -- and the market turmoilaccompanying it -- could undermine the already-flaggingconfidence of U.S. consumers and businessmen. &quot;This willlower consumer confidence at a time when the economy is stillsoft,&quot; says Murray Maxwell, executive vice president ofBernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc., a New York-basedcredit-reporting agency that specializes in apparel.   And a high dollar and a damaged European economy couldhurt U.S. exports to Europe. The combination of events could&quot;significantly raise the threat of a doubledip recession,&quot;says John Wilson, chief economist of Bank of America.   One big question that hangs over U.S. agribusiness is thefate of the $1.5 billion in export credits that the U.S. haspromised the Soviets. The Agriculture Department yesterdaywasn't saying whether the remaining $900 million in unusedcredits will be suspended; that would be a blow to U.S. grainproducers, for whom the Soviet Union is a major customer. Buta White House statement issued last evening said the U.S.&quot;will not support economic aid programs&quot; if the coupsucceeds.   But William Louis-Dreyfus, head of a giant internationalgrain-trading company bearing his name, says he didn't expecteither the Soviet Union or the U.S. to disrupt the graintrade. &quot;I think one of the U.S.S.R.'s first concerns has tobe food for its people,&quot; Mr. Louis-Dreyfus says. &quot;Whoever isrunning the country will recognize this as a high priority.&quot;                                                                                                          Eastern Europe                                                                                                          Long dependent on the Soviet Union for trade and naturalresources, Eastern Europe could lose heavily from potentialdisorder there. Any disruption to the Soviet's oil exports,to its ability to import or to its production would be feltseverely.   &quot;In Eastern Europe, this raises enormous uncertainties,&quot;says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman SachsInternational. Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia would be hurt themost because they remain the most dependent on Soviet trade.Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania would be hurt the least.   Also worrisome is the possibility of a wave of immigrationfrom the Soviet Union. &quot;These countries are already facingenormous unemployment,&quot; says Tomasz Telma, an economist withPlanEcon Inc., a consulting firm specializing in EasternEurope and the Soviet Union. &quot;If civil war broke out and awave of immigration swept Eastern Europe, that wouldcertainly have dire economic implications.&quot;                                                                                                          Western Europe                                                                                                          Big problems for Eastern Europe cause big problems forWestern Europe -- especially Germany. The German governmentis already spending 140 billion marks a year to shore up theeconomic wreckage of East Germany; problems in the SovietUnion could raise the price.   The problem was highlighted in currency markets yesterday,where the mark nose-dived six pfennigs against the dollar asinvestors fled Germany. And German stocks plummeted. Heaviesthit were companies with links to the Soviet Union, includingpipemaker Mannesmann AG, the Siemens AG electrical group andDaimler-Benz AG. Shares of Germany's leading banks,especially Deutsche Bank, posted heavy losses amid fears thatthe new Soviet leadership could interrupt repayment ofmultibillion-dollar credits, although much of them have beenbacked by Bonn government guarantees.   &quot;The unity bubble burst today,&quot; said Nigel Longley, abroker for Commerzbank AG. &quot;Everybody was looking at a newCold War and a lot of unanswered questions.&quot;   With foreign investors on the run, the Germans will haveto pick up more of the bill for unification. &quot;We have beenrelying heavily on foreigners to help finance this, but nowthere is reason to fear that many of them will think twice,reducing the inflow of capital,&quot; says Heidemarie Sherman, aneconomist at the Ifo Economic Research Institute in Munich.Higher interest rates may be needed to defend the currencyand attract foreign investors, damaging for the Germaneconomy.   And if the Soviet crisis snarls the German economy, italso will damp prospects throughout Europe, which looks tothe Germans for both economic stimulus and monetarystability. &quot;The European markets have been buoyed over thelast two years by the implications of what Gorbachev has beendoing,&quot; says Paul Jackson, economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.in London. &quot;Any threat to the restructuring of East Germanyand the rest of Eastern Europe has to be damaging to Europeanmarkets.&quot;                                                                                                          Japan                                                                                                          News of Mr. Gorbachev's ouster sent the Tokyo stock markettumbling yesterday, with the Nikkei average taking itsfifth-biggest drop ever. And many analysts predicted furtherdeclines today. &quot;To be honest, no one really knows what'shappening yet,&quot; said Robert Wicks, a salesman at James CapelPacific (Japan) Ltd. &quot;The whole market is in a state ofparalysis.&quot;   Still, many analysts say Tokyo is likely to be lessaffected than Europe and the U.S. &quot;We'll be watchingmovements in the U.S. and Europe carefully, but the Sovietsituation doesn't directly affect market fundamentals inTokyo,&quot; says Yasufumi Ohigashi, general manager of domesticequity sales at Nomura Securities Co.   &quot;I keep thinking that this ought to be bad for Japan, butfor the life of me I can't see why,&quot; echoes Peter Norton,director of research at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. &quot;Bythis time next week, I'd much rather be invested in Japanthan in Germany.&quot;   ---   Tim Carrington in London and Clay Chandler in Tokyocontributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
