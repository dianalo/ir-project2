<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0057 </DOCNO><TEXT>It has been shown previously that the quality of control achievable fora certain system (its dynamic resilience) is limited by the nonminimumphase characteristics of the plant, constraints on the manipulated variablesand model uncertainty. Model uncertainty requires the controller to bedetuned and performance to be sacrificed. The goal of this paper is toquantify this well known qualitative statement. A general discussionof the model uncertainty problem is followed by the derivation of simplebounds on the nominal performance imposed by the robust stability conditionfor some uncertainty descriptions. These bounds are relatively easy toevaluate and should be effective tools for screening alternate designsin terms of their resilience characteristics. It is shown that the useof the minimized condition number as a sensitivity measure implicityassumes that the relative errors of the transfer matrix elements areindependent and have similar magnitude bounds.</TEXT></DOC>
