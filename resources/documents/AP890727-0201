Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union ofRailwaymen, announced the decision after a seven-hour meeting amongunion leaders.   He said the decision would preserve the ``high level of unity''shown during the labor dispute over pay and collective bargaining.   Knapp said talks would continue with British Rail on retaining asystem of national negotiations on pay and working conditions. Thecompany wants to replace collective bargaining with localagreements.   Sir Robert Reid, British Rail chairman, said, ``I am verypleased that they have accepted our offer like the other twounions,'' the locomotive engineers and the ticket clerks.   The decision to end the strikes came amid signs of a crack inworker solidarity Wednesday, when 12,500 of the 72,000 railmenturned up for their jobs during the sixth 24-hour walkout in sixweeks, according to company estimates.   The union had sought a 10 percent pay increase for its members.They initially received considerable support from the public,angered also by condition of the rundown national rail network.   British Rail initially offered workers a 7 percent raise.   But public exasperation with the lack of trains has mounted, andNeil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, urgedrailwaymen to end their strikes.   Railwaymen are among Britain's lowest paid industrial workers.With overtime, drivers earn the equivalent of about $485 a week,while other railroad workers earn $335 weekly.   A train drivers' dispute over pay and working conditions willcontinue on the London subway, which carries about 1 millionpassengers daily.</TEXT></DOC>
