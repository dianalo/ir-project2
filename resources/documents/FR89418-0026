The three changes are: (1) Change the definition to delete referenceto the DD Form 1519 and to add reference to a Memorandum of Understandingand contractual commitments; (2) change procedure to permit differentiationbetween planned producers by the degree of commitment required. The differentiationis categorized into three groups. Group A entails the least commitmenton both Contractor and Government. It is a Memorandum of Understandingwith a DD Form 1519 (test) attached. The contractor agrees to maintainproduction capability for two years but is not contractually bound to doso. The signatory company is designated a ``planned producer'' and, assuch, becomes eligible to compete in all buys over $25,000 of the planneditem which are not restricted to the Mobilization Base in accordance withan approved Justification and Approval. (That is, they must be solicitedfor full and open buys and for those restricted to U.S. and Canada, butdo not participate in buys restricted to a group of named MobilizationBase Planned Producers.) Group B entails a greater degree of commitmenton the part of both sides. The contractor agrees to maintain productioncapability for a negotiated period of time on a no-cost basis and is contractuallybound to do so which then entitles the contractor to be solicited for allbuys of the item over $25,000 including those acquisitions for which competitionis restricted to Mobilization Base planned procedures.

Background   </ITAG>In 1985 the Under Secretary of the Army suspended the Army's use of theDD Form 1519 for Industrial Preparedness Production Planning (IPP). In1987 the Under Secretary of the Army approved the development of a revisedsystem for the conduct of IPP within the Army. The need for such revisionwas evidenced by poor accuracy in data collection using the DD Form 1519and the lack of commitment involved with the voluntary only DD Form 1519process. The new Army system, Production Planning Schedule (PPS), separatesdata collection from commitment. This allows greater flexibility for planningpurposes in that the three aforementioned alternatives are available toenlist commitment, from the parties. The original DD Form 1519 was strictlya voluntary non-binding commitment on either party. Aside from the commitmentthe original DD Form 1519 has been updated for Army use and a DD Form 1519(test) is currently undergoing OMB review. The test form will not involvecommitment on the part of either party as it will serve only as a datacollection instrument. The new form contains definitions and unlike theold form it is explicit in its request for varying data. Nonstandard andmisinterpreted answers will be minimized thus improving data accuracy.<ITAG tagnum="84">B.

Section 5152.208-9001 is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">5152.208-9001 Industrial preparedness planning.</ITAG>As prescribed at 5108.070 (g)(1)(i) insert the following clause in fulltext in contracts where the contractor is designated a Mobilization BasePlanned Producer. <ITAG tagnum="74">Industrial Preparedness Planning (XXX1989) (DEV)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The Government designates the contractor a Mobilization Base PlannedProducer (MBPP) for the item(s) listed in subparagraph (e) below. As aMBPP for the listed items, the contractor will be solicited for all acquisitionsof the items(s), including those for which competition is restricted toMobilization Base Planned Producers pursuant to an approved Justificationand Approval. The Government reserves the right to obtain the item(s) listedfrom sources other than the commercial marketplace, i.e., by assigningworkload to a government-owned facility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The Contractor agrees to</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Update the Production Capacity Survey DD Form 1519 (test) foreach item biennially;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Accomplish subcontractor planning as required in subparagraph(f) below;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Permit Government personnel access to records, manufacturingprocess data, plants and facilities in order to verify data on the ProductionCapacity Survey DD Form 1519 (test). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Maintain the surge/mobilization capacity set forth in the ProductionPlanning Schedules during active production of the item and for a periodof (negotiated number) years after physical completion of this productioncontract. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The Contractor is aware of the Government's dependence upon theProduction Planning Schedules as a basis to take appropriate measures toensure the adequacy of the United States Industrial Base. The Contractoralso recognizes the Government's intention to convert Production PlanningSchedule to contracts on a selective basis, as may be required to minimizemateriel shortages during mobilization or to meet contingencies short ofa declared national emergency. The Contractor agrees to accept contractsfor the item(s) in accordance with the Production Planning Schedules. Inthe event mobilization or contingencies short of a declared national emergencyoccur after active production has ceased, and the allocated capacity isin use for the production of other item(s), the Contractor agrees to immediatelydiscontinue production of such other item(s) if necessary to meet productionschedules for the planned item(s). The Contractor further recognizes thatit is the Government's intention to require that planned subcontractorsupport will be similarly converted to production subcontracts. Productiondelivery obligations under this clause are governed by Title I of the DefenseProduction Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2061, et seq.) (DefenseProduction Act) and as applicable are within the purview of the DefensePriorities and Allocation System.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) For the listed item(s), the Contractor certifies by signing thiscontract that the plant capacity required to support the mobilization quantitylisted on the Production Capacity Survey DD Form 1519 (Test) will be dedicatedexclusively for the production of that item at mobilization. Furthermore,the Contractor certifies that this capacity is not shared by any othermobilization production requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) This clause covers the item(s) listed below:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2(0,4,4),tp0,i1,s10,r15,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Item <D>Item </D><D>IPPL</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Schedule No. <D>Nomenclature </D><D>Priority</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Sample)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">M11111 <D>Fuze, Rocket, MK987 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">M22222 <D>Machine Gun, MK35 </D><D>2</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) The Industrial Preparedness Planning List (IPPL) identifies andprioritizes end items and components requiring Industrial PreparednessPlanning to maintain an industrial base capable of meeting surge/mobilizationrequirements. Mandatory vertical (subcontractor) planning will be accomplishedby the Contractor for all IPPL priority 1 items (see paragraph (e) above),by using a Production Capacity Survey, DD Form 1519 (Test). The Contractoragrees to coordinate completion of the DD Form 1519 (Test) Production CapacitySurvey and finalize prime and subcontractor planning with the Armed ServiceProduction Planning Officer (ASPPO) having cognizance over the prime contractor'sfacility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) Subcontractors, suppliers and vendors provide many of the componentsof military end items. The lack of critical components could be one ofthe major limitations of the United States' ability to support its ArmedForces warfighting capabilities. Therefore, the Government designated criticalcomponents and/or subassemblies in Block andplusmin;27 of the attached ProductionCapacity Survey DD Form 1519 (Test) are those for which the Contractorwill conduct vertical planning if not produced in-house.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(h) Additional critical components and/or subassemblies may be identifiedby the Contractor in block andplusmin;21 of the attached Production CapacitySurvey DD Form 1519 (Test).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Foreign producers (other than Canada) will not be considered asa source of supply for critical components.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(j) After completion of active production for the item(s), the Governmentwill annually, or as changes occur but not more than annually, furnishthe Contractor updated technical data for the item. The Contractor agreesto review the technical data and to report to the Government within 60days of receipt of the data, the impact of technical changes, if any, tothe current Production Planning Schedules at no additional cost to theGovernment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(k) Retention by the Contractor of the surge/mobilization capacityset forth in the Production Planning Schedules after completion of activeproduction of the planned item(s) will not necessarily require that theContractor maintain such capacity in idle status. Contractor utilizationof capacity allocated for planned production for production of other non-planneditems is consistent with the intent of any postproduction provisions ofthis contract, provided no degradation of surge/mobilization capacity occursas a result, and provided that the approval of the Contracting Officerwith property cognizance is obtained for the use of any Government-ownedproperty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(End of clause)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John O.
