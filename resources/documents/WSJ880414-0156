On Dec. 9, when violence first erupted in Gaza, Mr. Trainin was commanding a battalion in the area.    &quot;It was like my worst nightmare,&quot; says the 44-year-old lieutenant colonel in the army reserve. &quot;We were facing children who weren't even old enough to go to school.&quot;    When his duty ended two weeks later, Mr. Trainin went straight to a peace rally in Jerusalem and made an impassioned speech about his experience.    Until June, when he is once again required for reserve duty, he will work at his regular job as director of an institute that promotes Jewish-Arab understanding. The Israeli army has many senior officers such as Mr. Trainin, who are as active in the country's peace movement as they are in its military forces.    In the occupied territories, their views are often directly opposed to the hard-line positions of the Jewish settlers they must protect. As the Palestinian uprising drags through its fourth month, the relationship between the army and the settlers has soured further with the shooting last week of a 15-year-old Jewish girl.    When settlers initially reported that Tirza Porat had been killed by Palestinians while hiking near an Arab village, they excoriated the army for its failure to quell violence in the territories. The army's contrary finding -- that the girl probably had been accidentally shot in the head by a panicked Jewish guard -- enraged the settlers further.    Because Israel doesn't have the luxury of an all-volunteer military force, its army can't escape the schisms of opinion that beset the wider society. The embattled state has to call on its entire population, conscripting boys and girls straight from school and requiring most men to serve a month or more in the reserves each year until age 55.    &quot;This isn't a professional army with a capital P,&quot; says Col. Yoni Shimshoni, a commander of one of the West Bank's most troubled regions. &quot;We aren't a caste, we don't live separately -- every father is a soldier.&quot;    If anything, the army's current high command is more liberal than the Israeli cabinet and more dovish than most settlers, says Ze'ev Schiff, a military historian and correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. The generals, he says, have been &quot;keeping the lid on&quot; growing political pressure to use more force.    Many of the senior officers are kibbutzniks, descendents of the country's socialist pioneers. Kibbutzniks always have been over-represented in the army's elite fighting units and in its officer corps.    Settlers, by contrast, often come from the one section of the population that has the option of not serving in the army. Many are Orthodox Jews who believe that the occupied territories are an inalienable part of biblical Israel. Under Israeli law, religious women aren't required to serve in the army at all, while men may apply for an indefinite deferment during religious studies, which can last a lifetime.    An odd outcome of the turmoil in the territories is that soldiers who once dreaded serving on the Lebanon border now are welcoming that duty, despite the greater danger there. While only one soldier has been killed in the territories since the uprising began, six have died in the same period on the border, preventing infiltration by heavily armed terrorists.    &quot;Up here there's nothing to discuss,&quot; says Daniel Calb, a 19-year-old patrol commander. &quot;Here we aren't policemen, we're soldiers.&quot; The border-fence he patrols is pocked by bullets where two terrorists died in a firefight a few weeks earlier.    Soldiers on the chilly border enjoy warm relations with the local community. &quot;You'll see mothers from the kibbutzim coming with cakes and goodies for the soldiers,&quot; says Brig. Gen. Yair Yoram, a border commander. &quot;And if you ask a soldier what he's doing he'll tell you he's protecting the little kids in those kibbutzim.&quot;    In the occupied territories, the general says, relations are often strained by the settlers' demands for a tougher policy towards the Palestinians. &quot;They create provocation to push the army towards it,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't think the units there like it very much.&quot; Some Israelis worry that this friction, coupled with ambivalence about their role, might lead to morale problems among soldiers.    Israelis value their army's reputation as highly trained, technologically sophisticated and morally superior. Many see this image vanishing amid pictures of club-wielding riot police.    &quot;People will be coming out of the territories who don't know how to use a rifle barrel-forward, they're so used to using it the other way round for beating,&quot; says Yitzhak Galnoor, a professor of political science at Hebrew University and a major in the army reserve.    Mr. Galnoor joined the army in 1959 and first saw active duty in the 1967 Six Day War. Whenever he gets together with his contemporaries, stories of their military experiences naturally spill out. But now, he says, many young soldiers have military careers that began amid the controversy of the Lebanon war and are continuing in the Palestinian uprising.    &quot;For the first time there's a generation of soldiers who don't feel like talking about it the way we do,&quot; he says. Long-term effects on soldiers' morale will depend on the outcome of the uprising, says Mr. Schiff, the military historian. If nothing changes, he says, soldiers may become increasingly embittered by the duties they are required to perform.    &quot;But if, in the end, the war in the territories terminates with an understanding {at the peace table} I'm sure they will look back on their experiences in a different way -- a price paid for a positive result.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
