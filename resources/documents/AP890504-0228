(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A veteran federal mediator plans to meetwith negotiators for striking miners and Virginia's largest coalcompany on Friday and Saturday in an effort to break a two-yeardeadlock in contract talks.   Pittston Coal Group, however, has refused the United MineWorkers' offer to suspend picketing and demonstrations if thecompany stops mining operations during a seven-day cooling-offperiod.   In response, miners on Thursday resumed civil disobediencetactics that have resulted in 1,290 arrests outside Pittstonoperations in southwest Virginia since the strike began April 5.   ``I'm keeping my fingers crossed on this,'' Ted Chaskelson,legal counsel for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,said from his Washington office.   The agency, a wing of the U.S. Labor Department, assigned thecase to Joe Kirkham of Louisville, who has mediated labor disputesfor 28 years.   Kirkham is planning to meet with the UMW negotiating team Fridayand the company representatives Saturday before getting themtogether next week. Times and sites had not been decided lateThursday.   The strike, which began April 5, affects about 1,500 miners inVirginia and West Virginia. Two hundred other union miners workingat Pittston operations in Kentucky have not yet left their jobs.   For the most part, the demonstrations have been non-violent andthe charges limited to obstructing free passage, a misdemeanor.   On Tuesday, however, seven miners and two contract drivers forthe company were injured when miners pelted the trucks with rocksand the drivers plowed into demonstrators.   State police Thursday arrested 21 striking miners for blockingthe entrance to a Pittston mine and processing plant at McClure. Inseparate incidents later in the day, they arrested 14 miners forthrowing rocks at coal trucks, Lt. J.B. Willis said.   Nonetheless, both sides said they were cautiously optimisticthat the federal mediation would help settle the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
