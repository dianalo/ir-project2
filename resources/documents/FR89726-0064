This system is the ``Accounts Receivable Module.''We have provided background information about the proposed system in the``Supplemental Information'' section below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This proposed action will be effective, withoutfurther notice, September 25, 1989, unless public comments are receivedwhich result in a contrary determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be addressed to: Director, FinancialManagement Division, (PM-226F), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Gary M. Katz, Director, FinancialManagement Division (PM-226F), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.Telephone: (202) 382-5097.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>EPA is establishing an integrated financialmanagement system (IFMS), an automated information system which will includeall records related to the Agency's financial and budgetary responsibilities.The IFMS will encompass several, separate Privacy Act systems of records,all of which will be accessed by individual's names through the IFMS cross-referenceindex. The Accounts Receivable Module, which is the subject of this PrivacyAct notice, will be part of the IFMS.The Accounts Receivable Module will be used to create a record of all receivablesowed the Agency and to track the status of these receivables. Other usesinclude generating management reports, following up on overdue accounts,and identifying past due accounts.This system of records will also be used to implement the Debt CollectionAct of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). The Debt Collection Act was established toincrease the efficiency of Government-wide efforts to collect debts owedthe United States and to provide additional procedures for the collectionof such debts. These procedures authorize Federal agencies to take advantageof debt collection services and techniques commonly available to the privatesector, such as the use of private debt collection agencies and creditbureaus, and the collection of debts through salary and administrativeoffset. To implement these techniques and services, the Debt CollectionAct authorizes agencies to disclose the names, addresses, and social securitynumbers of individuals, and personal debt collection information from systemsof records.The Privacy Act permits agencies to disclose information without the consentof the individual for ``routine uses'', that is, for purposes that arecompatible with the purposes for which the information is collected. Certainroutine uses proposed for this system meet the compatibility requirementof the Privacy Act because they are either specifically authorized by orare consistent with and directly related to the purposes of the Debt CollectionAct. These proposed uses and, where applicable, the sections of the DebtCollection Act which authorize their use, include the following: (1) Informationwill be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in order to obtaina taxpayer's mailing address to locate the taxpayer for debt collectionpurposes (Section 8, codified at IRC 6103). (2) Taxpayer mailing addressesobtained from the IRS will be disclosed to agents of EPA in order to locatethe taxpayer for debt collection purposes. However, disclosures of a taxpayermailing address obtained from the IRS to a consumer reporting agency maybe made only for the purpose of having credit reports prepared by the consumerreporting agency (Section 8, codified at IRC 6103). (3) In addition totaxpayer mailing addresses, other debtor information will be disclosedto consumer reporting agencies to obtain credit reports for use by EPAfor debt collection purposes. (4) Debtor information will be disclosedto other Federal agencies to effect salary or administrative offsets (Section5, codified at 5 U.S.C. 5514, and Section 10, codified at 31 U.S.C. 3716,respectively, and as authorized in common law). Before making disclosuresfor offset purposes, EPA will comply with all procedural steps and safeguardsrequired by Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection Act. (5) Debtor informationwill be disclosed to debt collection agencies under contract to EPA tocollect debts owed the United States (Section 13, codified at 31 U.S.C.3718, and as authorized in common law). Debt collection agencies will berequired to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act and will besubject to the criminal penalty provisions of that Act. (6) Debtor informationwill also be provided to the United States Justice Department for litigationpurposes or further administrative action in connection with debt collection.(7) Information from this sytsem may be disclosed to other Federal agenciesconducting computer matching programs to help eliminate fraud and abuseand to detect unauthorized overpayments made to individuals (In that event,EPA will comply with the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of1988 and appropriate Office of Management and Budget guidelines). The term``debtor information'' as used in the proposed routine uses for this systemis limited to the individual's name, address, social security number, andother information necessary to identify the individual; the amount, statusand history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claimarose.Other proposed routine uses for the Accounts Receivable Module, althoughnot directly related to debt collection activities, are compatible withthe purposes for which information in this system is collected. These usesare appropriate and necessary to carry out EPA's financial management responsibilities.Section 2 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, codified at 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12),is an amendment to the Privacy Act which permits disclosures of delinquentdebtor information (as described above) to consumer reporting agenciesfor the purpose of making delinquency and default data available to privatesector grantors of credit. Such disclosures will be made only when a claimis overdue, and then only after the debtor has been afforded the due processrights specified in the Debt Collection Act of 1982. Although such disclosuresare authorized as an exception to the Privacy Act rather than as a routineuse, EPA is publishing notice of these disclosures at the end of the listingof routine uses in accordance with the guidance of the Office of Managementand Budget.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.
