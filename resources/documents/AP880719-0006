We believe that the last seven years have witnessed anunprecedented assault on our national interest and nationalsecurity through the poisoning of our air with acid rain, thedumping of toxic wastes into our water, and the destruction of ourparks and shores; that pollution must be stopped at the source byshifting to new, environmentally sound manufacturing and farmingtechnologies; that the federal government must promote recycling asthe best, least costly way to solve the trash crisis, aggressivelyenforce toxic waste laws and require polluters to be responsiblefor future cleanup costs; that this nation must redouble itsefforts to provide clean waterways, sound water management and safedrinkable ground water throughout the country; that our nationalparks, forests, wildlife refuges, and coastal zones must beprotected and used only in an environmentally sound manner; thatall offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas shouldbe opposed; and that regular world environment summits should beconvened by the United States to address the depletion of the ozonelayer, the ``greenhouse effect,'' the destruction of tropicalforests and other global threats and to create a global action planfor environmental restoration.   We believe that all Americans, producers and consumers alike,benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few largecorporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands offamily farmers obtaining a fair price for their product; that thedisastrous farm policies of the last seven years, despite recordfederal spending, have forced hundreds of thousands of familiesfrom their farms while others are struggling to survive; and that aworkable agricultural policy should include supply management,reasonable price supports, soil conservation and protection ofrural water quality, credit and foreclosure relief, the return offederally held foreclosed lands to minority, beginning andrestarting farmers, the development of new uses and markets forAmerican farm products, improved disaster relief, and therevitalization of rural America through new sources of capital forrural business and new federal support for rural health care,housing, education, water supply and infrastructure.   We further believe that no person should go to bed hungry andthat we must renew the fight against hunger at home and abroad,make food available to those nations who need it and want it, andconvene an international conference of food producing nations.   We believe that a balanced, coherent energy policy, based ondependable supplies at reasonable prices, is necessary to protectour national security, ensure a clean environment, and promotestable economic growth and prosperity, both nationally and in ourenergy producing regions; that the inevitable transition from ourpresent, nearly total dependence on increasingly scarce andenvironmentally damaging nonrenewable sources to renewable sourcesshould begin now; that such a policy includes increased cooperationwith our hemispheric neighbors, filling that Strategic PetroleumReserve, promoting the use of natural gas, methanol and ethanol asalternative transportation fuels, encouraging the use of our vastnatural gas and coal reserves while aggressively developing cleancoal technology to combat acid rain, and providing targeted newincentives for new oil and gas drilling and development, for thedevelopment of renewable and alternative sources of energy, and forthe promotion of energy conservation. We believe that with thesechanges the country could reduce its reliance on nuclear powerwhile insisting that all plants are safe, environmentally sound andassured of safe waste disposal.   We believe that this country's democratic processes must berevitalized: by securing universal, same day and mail-in voterregistration as well as registration on the premises of appropriategovernment agencies; by preventing the misuse of at-largeelections, the abuse of election day challenges and registrationroll purges, any undercounting in the national census, and anydilution of the one-person, one-vote principle; by endingdiscrimination against public employees who are denied the right tofull political participation; by supporting statehood for theDistrict of Columbia; by treating the offshore territories underour flag equitably and sensitively under federal policies,assisting their economic and social development and respectingtheir right to decide their future in their relationship with theUnited States; by empowering the commonwealth of Puerto Rico withgreater autonomy within its relationship with the United States toachieve the economic, social and political goals of its people, andby giving it just and fair participation in federal programs; byassuring and pledging the full and equal access of women andminorities to elective office and party endorsement; and byminimizing the domination and distortion of our election by moneyedinterests.   We believe in a stronger America ready to make the tough choicesof leadership in an ever-dangerous world: militarily stronger inour overall defense and anti-terrorist capabilities and in thecohesion of our military alliances; economically stronger at homeand in the global marketplace; intellectually stronger in theadvances of our schools, science and technology; and spirituallystronger in the principles we exemplify to the world.   We believe in a clearheaded, tough-minded, decisive Americanforeign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats toour security and respond to them in a way that reflects our valuesand the support of our people, a foreign policy that will respectour Constitution, our Congress and our traditional democraticprinciples and will in turn be respected for its quiet strength,its bipartisan goals, and its steadfast attention to the concernsand contributions of our allies and international organizations.   We believe that we must reassume a role of responsible activeinternational leadership based upon our commitment to democracy,human rights and a more secure world; that this nation, as theworld power with the broadest global interests and concerns, has agreater stake than any in building a world at peace and governed bylaw; that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it; andthat to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
