The surprise announcement -- part of Mr. Gorbachev'ssweeping response over the weekend to President Bush'sarms-cut initiative -- goes beyond U.S. proposals by limitingthe number and the firepower of most Soviet land-basedmissiles, which are the heart of the Kremlin's nucleararsenal. It is the critical step senior Pentagon and WhiteHouse officials have demanded, and eagerly waited for, sinceMr. Gorbachev's early years in power.</LP><TEXT>   The Soviet counterproposal, clearly intended to snatch theinitiative back from the U.S., marks the end of the 46-yearcompetition by the two superpowers to build ever bigger anddeadlier weapons of mass destruction. But the scope andtiming of Mr. Gorbachev's comments also seem shrewdlycalibrated to fuel demands inside the U.S. for deep defensespending cuts the White House wants to avoid.   While Mr. Gorbachev said the package was developed intandem with leaders of Soviet republics, including Russia'sBoris Yeltsin, his willingness to act rapidly and decisivelynevertheless strengthens his hand at home. The Sovietpresident remains the man the U.S. still must deal with onarms control -- an issue he has embraced with almost utopianzeal ever since taking office in 1985.   &quot;I would like to stress that by taking unilateral andbilateral steps and holding negotiations, we push forward theprocess of disarmament, approaching the goal proclaimed inearly 1986 -- a nuclear-free, safer and more stable world,&quot;Mr. Gorbachev said during a nationally televised speech. Thedecision followed a week of hesitation and behind-the-scenesactivity following Mr. Bush's initiative.   President Bush's response was equally positive and upbeat,though he carefully avoided discussing specifics and stoppedshort of calling for a quick summit conference. &quot;I think theworld will view it as very positive. . . .they've come a longway,&quot; the president told reporters. But he added: &quot;There'swork to do before we sit down at another summit.&quot;   The easiest part of the Soviet package calls forelimination of almost all short-range nuclear arms, which theKremlin had been looking to abandon anyway. Withdrawal ofSoviets troops from Eastern Europe already makes theseweapons -- ranging from nuclear artillery shells to landmines -- obsolete and militarily insignificant, according toPentagon and U.S. arms-control officials. Indeed, theircontinued deployment poses immense financial burdens,security problems and political headaches in a country thatis in the process of breaking apart.   While these measures largely reciprocate moves announcedby President Bush, Mr. Gorbachev went one step further bysuggesting that all tactical, or short-range, nuclear bombsand missiles could be removed from front-line aircraft. Inthe same way, Mr. Gorbachev's decision to take Soviet heavybombers off alert status also underscores fundamentalquestions about the nuclear role of both superpowers' airforces in this new era.   The U.S. and its allies haven't been willing to remove allairborne tactical nuclear arms from Europe, but pressure todo that is now certain to increase.   But it was Mr. Gorbachev's newfound flexibility in otherareas -- especially his willingness to halt work on certainlong-range missiles and discuss cooperative anti-missiledefenses -- that attracted most of the attention of U.S.officials. Mr. Gorbachev, for example, said the U.S.S.R. willfreeze the number of its mobile intercontinental nuclearmissiles with multiple warheads, and it intends to stopdevelopment of more accurate and deadlier versions of otherlong-range missiles.   But here, too, administration officials said many of theproposals are packaged to make a virtue out of necessity. TheSoviet military, according to Pentagon analyses, finallyrealized that it doesn't have the money to test and deployreplacements for its SS-24 and SS-25 long-range missiles.   U.S. leaders for years have criticized Mr. Gorbachev, bothpublicly and privately, for refusing to order cuts in thoseexpensive programs. &quot;This is the first unequivocal sign thatSoviet strategic modernization budgets are headed down,&quot;asserted an administration official. &quot;Now, we'll wait fordetails on how quickly the lines on the chart will drop.&quot;   The Gorbachev plan still leaves a substantial number ofland-based Soviet missiles with multiple warheads that can betargeted individually, particularly the socalled SS-18 heavymissile. They will continue to counter the American arsenalof submarine-based missiles, which were left out of PresidentBush's proposal. But the Soviets seem eager to go further,calling for an additional 50% reduction in strategicoffensive weapons on both sides.   Even before the Soviet announcement, Rep. Les Aspin (D.,Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, toldreporters that &quot;it's back to the drawing board&quot; for theadministration's proposed six-year defense spendingblueprint. &quot;If you don't have a Soviet threat at all,&quot; heasked, &quot;what does it mean to have a triad&quot; of air, land andsea-based nuclear weapons?   Mr. Bush, for his part, is expected to reject the Sovietcall for halting all underground nuclear tests -- assertingthat such a move must be part of a comprehensive new armsaccord. The U.S. is likely to take the same stance withregard to cutting the number of long-range missiles belowthose permitted under the recently signed Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty.   The Soviet announcement came at a sensitive time as WhiteHouse and congressional leaders struggle over future Pentagonspending. Despite Mr. Bush's objections, the final 1992defense authorization bill is expected to include tens ofmillions of dollars to keep alive development of a mobileMidgetman missile. House and Senate conferees, after years ofimpasse, also are expected to agree on the concept of quicklydeveloping a primarily land-based anti-missile defensesystem, the Strategic Defensive Initiative, to guard againstaccidental or Third World missile attacks. Mr. Gorbachev'sproposals, in part, could undermine the emergingcongressional consensus behind both the Midgetman and SDI.</TEXT></DOC>
