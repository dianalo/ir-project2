On August 18, 1988, NHTSA granted NHTSA Exemption 88-1 to General MotorsCorporation (53 FR 31411). This exemption applies to no more than 2500Cadillac Seville and Eldorado passenger cars manufactured between August1, 1988, and August 1, 1989, and to not more than 2500 such vehicles manufacturedbetween August 1, 1989, and August 1, 1990. Exemption 88-1 excuses thesevehicles from compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR 571.108 MotorVehicle Safety Standard No. 108 <T3>Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment, </T3>that theybe equipped with front and rear side marker lamps and reflectors, and thattheir headlamps, stop lamps, and turn signal lamps meet the photometricrequirements of the standard. It also excuses such vehicles from compliancewith paragraphs S5.2.1 and S5.4.2 of 49 CFR 571.111 Motor Vehicle SafetyStandard No. 111 <T3>Rearview Mirrors</T3>.The basis of the petition was that, in the absence of an exemption, GMwould otherwise be prevented from selling a motor vehicle whose overalllevel of safety is equivalent to or exceeds the overall level of safetyof nonexempted motor vehicles (15 U.S.C. 1410(a)(1)(D), implemented by49 CFR 555.5 and 555.6(d)). Specifically, GM wished to institute a factorydelivery program for two of its cars, similar to programs established byEuropean manufacturers where Americans purchase vehicles conforming tothe Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The vehicles covered by GM'sfactory delivery program would be European citizens either visiting thiscountry or working temporarily here, who would export the vehicles to theirhome countries at the conclusion of their stay. Other than Standards Nos.108 and 111, the vehicles could be built to both European and U.S. safetyregulations, but relief was needed from those two standards in order toimplement the factory delivery program. On November 9, 1988, GM wrote NHTSA asking whether the exemption mightbe broadened to include the Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood cars, with theunderstanding that the 2500 vehicle per year limit would not be exceededas a result of this inclusion. In their U.S. version, these vehicles aresubstantially similar in compliance with Standards Nos. 108 and 111 tothe ones previously exempted (with the exception that the DeVille and Fleetwoodreplaceable bulb headlamps use HB3 and HB4 light sources, whereas thoseof the Seville and Eldorado used HB1s). Exempted Devilles and Fleetwoodcars would meet ECE photometrics, as do the Seville and Eldorado, ``usingthe H4 bulb''. Given the facts that the noncompliances would be identical,and that GM would otherwise be unable to sell the vehicles, the agencyhas decided to grant GM's request, and to amend the terms of Exemption88-1.Accordingly, the terms of Exemption 88-1 are amended to include the CadillacDeVille and Cadillac Fleetwood models with the Cadillac Seville and CadillacEldorado models, with the proviso that the total number of exempted vehiclessold shall not exceed 2500 in either of the two years that the exemptionis in effect. <ITAG tagnum="20">(15 U.S.C. 1410; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Diane K.
