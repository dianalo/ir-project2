WOLD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jan P. Syse became Norway's prime ministeron Monday, acknowledging he had a tough job ahead as leader of aminority coalition.   King Olav V officially installed Syse's three-party,non-socialist Cabinet of 11 men and eight women as Gro HarlemBrundtland's Labor government handed over power after 3{ years.   Syse's coalition of his own Conservative Party and the ChristianPeople's and Center parties controls 62 seats in the 165-memberlegislature. Labor and its allied Socialist Left party have 80seats. The right-wing Party of Progress holds the balance of powerwith 22 seats. There is one independent.   ``We must always have in mind that this is a minoritygovernment,'' said Syse, a 58-year-old lawyer, as he left the royalpalace.   ``It may be a difficult situation, but we will keep goodrelations with all parties outside the government.''   Syse said he was optimistic his government could live out itsfour-year term. ``There are no clear alternatives for anothergovernment,'' he said.   Looking up at the light drizzle, he added, ``Rain means luck.''   Mrs. Brundtland and her Cabinet were bid farewell at the palacetwo hours earlier.   She said she would not immediately try to bring down Syse'scoalition.   ``We'll have to give them a chance to show what they have inmind,'' she said.   Political analysts have voiced doubts about the coalition'sability to survive. A similar ruling minority alliance fell in 1986over a tax proposal, opening the door for Mrs. Brundtland. She seta precedent by naming women to nearly half the Cabinet posts.   Mrs. Brundtland will become Labor's floor leader in Parliamentand may head the legislature's Foreign Affairs Committee.   Eight ministers besides Syse are from his Conservative Party.His junior coalition partners, the Christian People's Party and theCenter Party, each was given five portfolios.   The Finance Ministry went to Conservative Arne Skauge, a41-year-old economist who held the same post in the previousnon-socialist cabinet.   Per Ditlev-Simonsen, 57, an experienced politician who majoredin economy and history at Stanford University in California, wasnamed defense minister.   Kjell Magne Bondevik, 42, leader of the Christian People'sParty, was named foreign minister and Johan J. Jacobsen, 52, headof the agrarian-based Center Party, took over the Ministry ofMunicipal Affairs.   The youngest minister appointed was Kristin Clement, 32, theminister of labor and wage affairs.   Syse appointed diplomat Tom Vraalsen, now ambassador to theUnited Nations, as minister of development aid under the ForeignMinistry.</TEXT></DOC>
