 &quot;If you land the right job, being a PC managermeans staying on top of everything that happens in networked computing,&quot; saidJosh Rosenberg, a former information-center (IC) manager and currenttechnical employment consultant for McCardle Consultants Inc., in Fort Lee,N.J.andM;Companies have created a lot of exciting positions to bring in the kind ofpeople who are attracted to the fast-changing pace in networked computing.andO;PC management is a field for the technical dabbler.andM;But it may not be the best place for the professional manager, according toRosenberg and a number of other consultants and managers interviewed by PCWeek.andP;  Many PC management positions pay six-figure salaries with generousbonuses.andP;  But it takes a virtual scorecard to figure out which of the myriadjob titles will generate the six-figure incomes.andP;  And no matter how well a PCmanager is paid, the job almost certainly will not lead to the upper echelonsof information systems (IS) management in the Fortune 1000.andM;In interviews with 28 professional job-placement consultants and informationmanagers, PC Week found broad definitions of the PC manager's role.andP;  Forexample, at BankAmerica Corp. in Concord, Calif., the information-centermanager is responsible for PC service and support, but he rarely touchessomeone else's PC.andP;  Instead, he manages more than 800 PC hardware andsoftware managers and runs the company's four internal computer stores.andM;&quot;It's difficult to squeeze meaning out of titles,&quot; said Joe Sasso, vicepresident of end-user support at Barclays Bank in New York.andP;  &quot;You have toknow someone inside the company who can explain the company politics.andP;  Insome corporations -- General Electric comes to mind -- the term manager isused rarely and it really means something.andP;  In other businesses, where thereis more layering of management, there might be a half-dozen managers and acouple of vice presidents in the same department.&quot;andM;&quot;The title manager does not automatically mean managing people or managingmoney,&quot; said Laurence Sheehan, president of DPSC Executive SearchInternational Inc. of Wellesley, Mass.andP;  &quot;There is a tendency [with somecompanies] to consider the person who knows technology to be a manager oftechnology.andP;  You have to understand each individual company culture tounderstand what the titles mean.&quot;andM;Sheehan noted that programmer-analysts can sometimes be in charge of smallsupport groups with far greater management responsibilities than PC managersin large companies where the &quot;manager&quot; reports to a large IS organization andis essentially the help desk.andM;At most companies, the programmer is a team member rather than a manager, butin companies that employ members of large unions -- chemical andmanufacturing firms being the standouts -- it can be listed as a managementposition.andP;  All programmers write programs and have command of one or morelanguages.andP;  Senior programmers, often in financial services and insurancefirms, can be project leaders or sometimes managers of large systems such asexecutive support or retail systems.andM;Job Description Clues?andM;&quot;Technical titles such as programmer are the most trustworthy,&quot; said SteveMorse, a senior technical officer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in NewYork.andM;Even salaries are no clue to the job description.andP;  The average salary ofprogrammers interviewed by PC Week is $45,000.andM;&quot;Geography may have some bearing on the salary,&quot; noted Vincent Amatulo, humanresources manager at Hunter Travel Services in New York.andP;  &quot;Our New Yorkoffice openly pays programmers more than it pays them in our Nevada office.andO;It's a type of cost-of-living differential.&quot;andM;Amatulo also noted that PC programmers in some companies make less than theirmainframe counterparts.andP;  &quot;But the mainframe people have a lot of seniorityand in some companies -- where there's a little bit of a problem findingsomeone with any PC programming experience -- the top programmer salaries arehigher than they are on the mainframe.&quot;andM;Although the analyst title generally implies some programming in theemployee's background, the title has a broad range of uses.andP;  When used as amanagement title, it includes such duties as liaison with line managers toanalyze needs and determine the effectiveness of systems.andM;When PC Week asked managers to describe their titles on the PC Week Extra!andO;on-line service, one of them noted: &quot;I am called PC analyst.andP;  I work at autility company, and my job is whatever it takes to give departments the PCtechnology they think they need.andP;  I have three people working for me.&quot;andM;But most often, the title analyst applies to systems and suggests suchresponsibilities as prototyping and troubleshooting.andM;Ironically, the most abused title in PC management is manager, which issometimes given to technical personnel to prevent a militant union fromclaiming them.andM;&quot;I have heard about cases where the title is used in lieu of cash,&quot; said MikeHarris, PC manager at Hunter Travel.andP;  &quot;My title means I order every one ofthe PCs at the home office [where there are 250 PCs] and the branches [wherethere are approximately 250 more PCs],&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I manage two technicalassistants and two programmers here, and we provide just about all theservices here from installing software to fixing broken hardware.andP;  In thebranches, they work with regional resellers.&quot;andM;PC manager titles abound at big companies.andP;  At United Parcel Service's (UPS')computing headquarters in Paramus, N.J., there is a manager of PC systems, aLAN- support manager and an IC manager.andP;  &quot;My job covers LAN research anddevelopment,&quot; explains Marc Dodge, LAN-support manager at UPS.andP;  &quot;The peoplewho report to me are exploring OS/2 networks.andP;  Or they can be an encyclopediafor support people in branch offices when the local people are stuck on aproblem.&quot;andM;The PC systems manager at UPS has broader responsibilities, includingprocurement and policy making, while the information center has somehelp-desk responsibilities for major systems.andM;Large companies frequently fill PC management positions with people who havebusiness degrees rather than technical degrees, or with people who havebusiness degrees from technology-oriented schools.andM;&quot;I got my masters in business from Polytechnic University in New York,&quot; saidWarren Winter, senior PC technology analyst for Pfizer Inc. in New York.andO;&quot;That background has proven to be helpful at Pfizer, where there's a tendencyto look at PCs more than anything else in the search for a businesssolution.&quot;andM;PC managers, especially information-center managers or end-user computingmanagers, had what some experts think was a window of opportunity up untilthe late 1980s.andM;&quot;Six or so years ago, IC managers had the world by the tail,&quot; said JamesWebber, executive director of Omicron, an information-management researchconsortium in Little Falls, N.J.andP;  &quot;They were the alter egos ofline-of-business managers, and I would have considered them prime candidatesto become [IS] directors or chief information officers.andP;  At that stage theyhad closer relationships with the line-of-business people than the CIOhimself or herself.andP;  But that has changed and the PC manager now has to gothrough the [IS] director or the CIO or the operations manager to talk to thetop executives.&quot;andM;The title PC manager can be the most deceiving, virtually all thoseinterviewed by PC Week said.andP;  &quot;Yeah, sure, I'm the PC manager here,&quot; said oneanonymous respondent to the PC Week Extra! query.andP;  &quot;I have a corner officeand my very own tool kit.andP;  I attend sales meetings and I install IRMA boards.andO;Now that's managing!&quot;andM;According to the 1989 Labor Department study, the titles director of PCs,director of networked computing, director of end-user computing and the likeare frequently given to professionals who report to the highest orsecond-highest management level at a corporation.andP;  This type of title isfrequently given to someone who is responsible for establishing a corporatearchitecture or to the manager of departmental PC managers.andM;&quot;We have a director of PC support and a director of network services,&quot; saidBrenda McNeil, human-resources manager of Lone Star Financial Services inDallas.andP;  &quot;They set the policies in their respective areas, and the people whoreport to them and do the day-to-day work on PCs and networks are calledmanagers.&quot;andM;The title vice president also means different things to different people.andM;&quot;If you have a vice president of end-user computing or a vice president of PCdevelopment or networked services or networked technologies, it is unclearfrom the title what the person does,&quot; human-resources expert Sheehan noted.andO;&quot;With a vice presidency, there are two issues to consider from the start --to whom does the vice president report and who reports to the vicepresident.&quot;andM;In banking and financial services, vice president and even senior vicepresident can be closer to middle management than upper management.andP;  Inmanufacturing, chemicals and very large retail outfits, vice presidencies mayrun a little higher up the corporate ladder.andM;Getting the Inside TrackandM;With all the titles and all the different responsibilities, it seems that thebest hope of job seekers and those looking to hire a PC manager is to go witha &quot;head hunter,&quot; or professional placement specialist.andP;  For almost allout-of-town assignments and for the very top-level job, that often is a goodsource of information.andP;  But several managers say there is no real scorecardfor the PC world.andM;&quot;I've used head hunters, personal contacts and even blind ads in the tradepress,&quot; said Barclays' Sasso.andP;  &quot;I've had about equal success.andP;  I think themost important issue is who you know in the company or who knows of you.andO;It's not just that most of us are political animals.andP;  When you know someoneinside, you can get the most direct explanation of what the position will be.andO;And when insiders know of you, they already have a handle on how you line upwith the job description.&quot;andM;Go ahead -- try to figure out what computer-management titles mean.andP;  At oneNew York bank, a vice president of support services is called the PC manager.andO;But at a Philadelphia conglomerate, a director of technical support does thesame job.andM;&quot;In some organizations, the PC manager job is done by people with threedifferent titles,&quot; said Anita McManus, an independent human-resourcesconsultant in New Brunswick, N.J.andM;&quot;I have a Fortune 500 client who has a vice president of networked computingin one department, an assistant vice president for workstation technology inanother department and a manager of microcomputing in a third department.andO;Each has the same essential job description,&quot; McManus said.andM;Just reshuffling the deck so the titles will make sense has motivated a lotof companies to rethink job titles.andM;&quot;One of the reasons we are working on defining job titles is that there areso many,&quot; said Ron Stelhorn of Midcon Corp., a natural gas company inChicago.andP;  &quot;Over time, you define a set of skills, then new needs emerge andyou have to redefine [them].andM;&quot;At Midcon, PC hardware support and PC software support can be done by aclient services coordinator,&quot; Stelhorn added.andP;  &quot;An information centerspecialist is what we call the person who does help-desk work.&quot;andM;Technical skills rarely become part of a title, although there areexceptions.andP;  &quot;At Midcon, a microcomputer maintenance specialist actually doesmicrocomputer maintenance,&quot; Stelhorn noted.andM;One subscriber to PC Week Extra!, PC Week's on-line product and vendorinformation service, suggested military titles for PC managers, includinggroup information systems management officer (GISMO), brigade informationsystems management officer (BISMO) and division information systemsmanagement officer (DISMO).andM;&quot;Government acronyms are always fun, but I saw one in an auto manufacturer'scorporate phone directory,&quot; said Terry Hamilton of Zane Systems Inc., a localarea network consulting firm based in Camp Hill, Pa.andP;  &quot;It was called managerof operations, personal computers -- or MOPS, for short.&quot;andM;A growing number of PC management titles are being gobbled up as networksexpand to include other platforms.andP;  One participant in the PC Week Extra!andO;poll noted that executives at a personnel search firm in Miami told him therewere no openings for PC managers, but that there were openings for managersof E-mail, network-supported systems and mainframe workstations.andM;&quot;In my shop, PCs are computers,&quot; one PC Week Extra! respondent wrote.andO;&quot;Applications, hardware, software and training are all handled by the samegroups that do the same for the mainframe.andP;  There simply is [no such thing asa] PC manager.&quot;
