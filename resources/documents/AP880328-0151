The vaccine will be marketed by SyntroVet Inc., Lenexa, Kan.,said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service. He said the new vaccine is thethird live genetically engineered product licensed by thedepartment for pseudorabies vaccination.   ``We have concluded the new vaccine is both safe andeffective,'' Glosser said. ``Our scientists have reviewed andanalyzed the procedures used to develop the vaccine, its biologicaland safety characteristics, and the safety and effectiveness datagathered during field trials in three states.''   Further, he said, an environmental assessment concluded that useof the vaccine would have ``no significant impact on the humanenvironment.''   ``During field trials, the new vaccine was administered to morethan 400 swine, including baby pigs, weaned pigs and sows,''Glosser said. ``No adverse reactions were noted.''   Pseudorabies, also known as Aujesky's disease or mad itch, doesnot affect humans. Although the disease caused an estimated $22million in losses to the swine industry last year, it is not apublic health problem, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
