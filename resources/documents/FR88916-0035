The proposed regulations would modify the existing StudentAssistance General Provisions and GSL and PLUS Program regulations to implementthis policy initiative.The costs for GSL defaults have been projected to total $1.6 billion inFiscal Year (FY) 1988, representing a 200 percent increase over the lastfive years and an estimated 44 percent of the Department's FY 1988 expendituresfor the GSL Program. An analysis recently conducted for the Departmenthas substantiated the magnitude of the GSL default problem as it relatesto participating postsecondary institutions. The analysis shows that, forsome 500 institutions, over 50 percent of GSL borrowers who entered repaymentduring FY 1985 defaulted during FY 1985 or FY 1986. Other institutionsshow very low default rates of former students for this period, suggestingthat there is much that high-default institutions can do to improve thedefault performance of their students.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Changes</ITAG>These proposed regulations would employ the concept of a ``fiscal yeardefault rate'' in determining which institutions would be subject to actionsto limit, suspend, or terminate their eligibility to participate in thestudent financial assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HigherEducation Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). This rate would be calculatedas the percentage of an institution's current and former students who enterthe repayment period in a given Federal fiscal year (October 1 throughSeptember 30) on GSL or SLS loans received for attendance at that institutionthat default before the end of the following Federal fiscal year.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 668_STUDENT ASSISTANCE GENERAL PROVISIONS</ITAG>Section 668.15 Additional factors for evaluating administrative capabilityThe Secretary proposes to amend current andSection; 668.15 to establish afiscal year default rate in excess of 20 percent in the GSL and SLS programsat an institution (1) as an additional indicator of the institution's inabilityto administer properly the Title IV student assistance programs, and (2)as a basis for the Secretary to commence a proceeding to limit, suspend,or terminate the institution's eligibility to participate in the TitleIV student assistance programs.Section 487(c)(1)(B) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to prescribe reasonablestandards of appropriate institutional capability for the administrationof the GSL and SLS Programs. Existing regulations treat an institution'scumulative default rate as a factor for evaluating an institution's administrativecapability, but place the burden on the Secretary to show that the institutionhas failed to take reasonable steps to reduce defaults in order to justifytermination of the institution's Title IV eligibility. These proposed regulationswould shift the burden to the institution to show that its excessive defaultrate is due to factors beyond its control, and would use fiscal year defaultrates, rather than cumulative rates, in analyzing an institution's administrativecapability.This proposed change and the associated changes that the Secretary proposesto make to andSection; 668.90 of these regulations would create a processthat would work as follows:1. If an institution has a fiscal year default rate of greater than 20percent, the Department would consider whether to commence a limitation,suspension, or termination proceeding. In doing so, the Department wouldtake into consideration any evidence the institution presented to the Department(including any evidence submitted pursuant to section 668.15(b)(2), ifrequested by the Department or otherwise submitted by the school). TheDepartment would determine whether limitation, suspension, termination,or other action was necessary.2. If the Department proposed to limit, suspend, or terminate the participationof an institution in the GSL program, the institution would be entitledto a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) under andSection; 668.90of these regulations. The ALJ would be required to adopt the Department'sproposed sanction against the institution unless the institution submittedthe information described in andSection; 668.15(b)(2) and demonstrated thatthe excessively high default rate was due to factors beyond its control(such as a precipitous and unforeseeable increase in unemployment in thefield in which a school prepares its students to work).The Secretary believes that this approach strikes an appropriate balancebetween preserving the integrity of the GSL program and ensuring that institutionsare not excluded from the GSL program because of circumstances beyond theircontrol.The Secretary emphasizes, however, that the Department does not considerthe composition of the student body admitted by an institution to be anacceptable explanation for a high default rate. An institution should notadmit a student who lacks the ability to benefit from the training offered.The Secretary believes that institutions that abide by this principle andprovide a high quality education will provide their students with skillsthat enable them to repay their loans. Indeed, there are many schools thatenroll a large proportion of disadvantaged students while maintaining alow default rate.The Secretary particularly invites comment on circumstances that shouldbe included or ruled out as examples of factors beyond a school's controlthat would permit a school to avoid the imposition of sanctions for a highdefault rate.The Secretary wishes to maximize the participation of guarantee agenciesin this process. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 668.15(b)(3) would providethat the Secretary may require the institution to submit to the Secretaryand one or more guarantee agencies materials relating to the causes ofdefault by its students and to its efforts to reduce defaults. This submissioncould be required prior to the Secretary's initiation of a terminationaction against the institution, or at any other time. The Secretary intendsto use this mechansim on a regular basis as a means for determining, inconsultation with guarantee agencies as appropriate, which actions shouldbe taken regarding particular institutions.Section 668.22 Distribution formula for institutional refunds and for repaymentof disbursements made to the student for non-institutional costs.The Secretary proposes to amend this section to conform to the refund provisionsin proposed andSection; 682.606.Section 668.44 Institutional information.The Secretary proposes to amend current andSection; 668.44 to require institutionsparticipating in the Title IV, HEA programs to provide certain consumerinformation to prospective students before enrollment.Under the proposal, an institution that provides an undergraduate non-baccalaureateprogram for a particular vocational, trade, or career field would be requiredto provide prospective students with_(1) Information on applicable State licensure or certification requirements;(2) The pass rates of the graduates of the program on any State-requiredexamination related to licensure or certification;(3) The program completion rate of its students; and(4) The job placement rate of its graduates.In addition, an institution that makes a claim to a prospective studentregarding the starting salaries of its graduates, or the starting salariesor local availability of jobs in a field in which it provides training,must disclose to the prospective student detailed information substantiatingthat claim.The Secretary believes that an important factor in preventing defaultson Title IV, HEA loans is the availability of adequate information thatthe prospective student may use to evaluate the quality of an institutionand its programs. This information is of particular importance in undergraduatenon-baccalaureate trade programs for a number of reasons:(1) Most of the programs are designed and marketed as a means for rapidlyimparting employment-related skills to a student without requiring thestudent to undergo a traditional liberal arts curriculum with a more attenuatedconnection with employment in a particular field. The success of studentsin completing the program, receiving licensure or certification by theState for practice in the particular occupation involved, and obtainingemployment in that occupation, is substantially more important to the decisionto enroll in the program, than for a longer or more traditional program.(2) Many students in these programs are young and unsophisticated, andtherefore less able than traditional undergraduate and graduate studentsto adequately inform themselves as to the quality of the program they areconsidering.(3) Many of these programs are marketed more aggressively than longer,more traditional programs, increasing the risk that students will not receiveadequate information to enable them to make a rational decision regardingenrollment.The Secretary believes that the information a school provides to a studentcontemplating enrollment in such a program must include accurate and meaningfulinformation on the school's performance in retaining and graduating itsstudents, and in preparing them for employment. To ensure that this informationis provided in a form that can be readily understood by unsophisticatedstudents, the proposed regulations would prescribe an easy-to-read formatfor schools to use to present this information.The proposed regulations would revise current andSection; 668.23 to requirea school to retain on file information substantiating the accuracy of alldisclosures made to prospective students under andSection; 668.44.Section 668.72 Nature of educational program.The Secretary proposes to revise this section to conform to the changesin proposed andSection; 668.44. The proposed changes in this section providethat false, erroneous, or misleading information provided under proposedandSection; 668.44 would constitute misrepresentation. Section 668.90 Initial and final decisions_appeals.As noted above, existing regulations treat a school's cumulative defaultrate as a factor for evaluating a school's administrative capability, butplace the burden on the Secretary to show that the school has failed totake reasonable steps to reduce defaults in order to justify terminationof the school's Title IV eligibility. The proposed regulations would shiftthat burden to the school and would use fiscal year default rates ratherthan cumulative rates in analyzing a school's administrative capability.To avoid limitation, suspension, or termination, whichever is proposedby the Department, an institution with a fiscal year default rate of over20 percent would be required to demonstrate that its excessive defaultrate is due to factors beyond its control. In cases where termination of a school's eligibility is appropriate, theSecretary believes that the termination should extend to all the TitleIV programs in which the school participates, in order to protect the Federalfinancial interest. The proposed regulation would also indicate, however,that the Secretary might impose a lesser sanction, such as limitation orsuspension, in an appropriate case. The Secretary is including a list of measures that a school may elect toadopt if it wishes to reduce its default rate and avoid the risk of a limitation,suspension, or termination proceeding. These measures are listed in AppendixD to Part 668. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 682_GUARANTEED STUDENT LOAN AND PLUS PROGRAMS</ITAG>Section 682.104 Applicability of regulations to the Supplemental Loansfor Students Program. This proposed new section would codify ED's current position that existingregulations governing PLUS loans made to students also governs SLS loans.Section 682.410 Fiscal, administrative, and enforcement requirements. The Secretary is proposing to amend current andSection; 682.410(c) governingguarantee agency reviews of participating schools to require a review ofany school whose fiscal year default rate exceeds 15 percent, unless theschool is the subject of a termination action by reason of its defaultrate. The Secretary believes that these reviews would complement Federaldefault reduction efforts by identifying schools with high default ratesthat, although not at risk for termination, may nevertheless be experiencingproblems with the administration of the GSL or SLS programs. Section 682.411 Due diligence by lenders in the collection of guaranteeagency loans. This proposed regulation would require a lender to provide a school witha copy of each preclaims assistance request, in order to make the schoolaware that a former student may be about to default. Section 682.604 Processing the borrower's loan proceeds and counselingborrowers. The Secretary is proposing to amend current andSection; 682.604 to requirea school to conduct an initial in-person counseling session at or beforethe first disbursement of the borrower's loan proceeds. These sessionswould be conducted either individually or with groups of students, andwould supplement information provided to borrowers through lenders' disclosurestatements. Correspondence schools would be exempted from the in-personrequirement of this proposal. The Secretary is also proposing to amend these regulations to reflect thestatutory requirement in section 485(b) of the HEA that a school conductexit counseling with a borrower, either individually or as part of a group,prior to the borrower's completion of the course of study, or at the timeof the borrower's withdrawal from school. If the borrower leaves the institutionwithout the institution's knowledge, the institution would have to providethe borrower with the required information in writing at the borrower'slast known address. In the exit counseling, the institution would review with the borrowerthe terms and conditions of the loan, help the borrower to understand hisor her rights and responsibilities regarding repayment, review the proceduresfor filing for deferment, cancellation, or postponement of repayment, andreview the consequences of a failure to repay the loan. These consequencesare detailed in proposed Appendix D to Part 668, item 15(a)(3)(ii). Undersection 485(b) of the HEA, the institution must also provide the borrowerwith general information on the average indebtedness of students who haveobtained GSL or SLS Program loans for attendance at that institution andthe average anticipated monthly repayment based on that average indebtedness,and review repayment options and debt management strategies available tothe borrower. The Secretary believes that these counseling efforts will significantlyincrease the borrower's understanding of the terms and conditions of theloan, and effectively impress upon the borrower the importance of meetinghis or her repayment obligations, thereby helping to reduce defaults. Section 682.605 Determining the date of a student's withdrawal. The Secretary proposes to amend andSection; 682.605 to clarify that the dateof a student's withdrawal calculated under this section would only relateto the institution's reports to lenders and to the date on which the institution'sduty to pay a refund arises, not to the amount of the refund owed. Section 682.606 School refund policy. The Secretary proposes to amend current andSection; 682.606 regarding aninstitution's refund policy to require an institution to employ a <T3>pro rata </T3>refund policy for a student receiving or benefiting froma GSL, SLS or PLUS program loan who withdraws prior to completion of theacademic period for which the loan is made. Under this policy, an institutionwould retain the percentage of loan funds equal to the portion of the student'sprogram actually completed by the student prior to the student's withdrawal,plus a reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the lesser of 5 percentof the total fee paid or $100, to help defray overhead expenses. The proposedregulations also address the treatment in the refund calculation of equipmentprovided by the school as part of a student's program materials. The Secretary believes that a refund policy under which an institutiondoes not refund a reasonable portion of the student's loan upon withdrawalcontributes significantly to the incidence of student loan defaults. CurrentandSection; 682.606 requires an institution to develop a fair and equitablerefund policy that conforms to applicable State law and any standards establishedby the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency or in theabsence of such standards, the specific refund policy standards outlinedin current Appendix A of this part. In many instances, under policies thatcomply with these standards, students who leave school shortly after enrollingare refuned very little, if any, of the loan amount originally intendedto cover most or all of the academic term for which they enrolled. Thesepolicies often cause resentment by students, who may believe they shouldnot be responsible for repaying loans for which they have not receivedsubstantial educational services. Further, a refund policy that allowsan institution to keep windfalls from students who do not graduate encouragesthe institution to enroll students lacking the ability to benefit fromthe training offered, and provides a financial disincentive for an institutionto take steps to improve the educational outcomes for its students. Allof these unfortunate results increase defaults. Section 682.607 Payment of a refund to a lender. The Secretary proposes to revise current andSection; 682.607 to require thatan institution pay the lender a refund no later than 30 days after theearlier of (1) the date the student withdraws, (2) the end of the semesterin which the student left school, or (3) the end of the loan period. Section 682.610 Records, reports, and inspection requirements for participatingschools. The proposed regulations would add a new paragraph to this section requiringan institution promptly to provide a lender or guarantee agency, upon request,with any information it has regarding the last known address, employer,or employer's address of current or former borrowers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. They are classified as non-major because they do not meetthe criteria for major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements are imposedon guarantee agencies, lenders, and schools by the regulations. As withcurrent regulations, these proposed regulations would permit terminationof institutions incapable of proper program administration, in order toprotect the Federal interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>Sections 668.15, 668.23, 668.44, 668.90, 682.604, 682.606, and 682.610contain information collection requirements. As required by the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy ofthese proposed regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the informationcollection requirements should direct them to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building,Washington, DC 20503; Attention: James D.

The Secretary especially invites comments onhow job placement would be defined under andSection; 668.44, and how thesite visits that would be required to be performed by guarantee agenciesunder andSection; 668.41 might be distributed to maximize the reduction ofthe default rate. All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will beavailable for public inspection, during and after the comment period, inROB-3, Room 4310, 7th and D Streets SW., Washington, DC, between the hoursof 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federalholidays.
