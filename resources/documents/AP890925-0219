LOUIS, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   St. Louis, once the throbbing capitalof a vast French West African empire, has fallen on hard times.   The atmosphere is still there. In fact, the place reeks of it.   Palm trees sway. Beige and pink colonial-style buildings withwrought-iron balconies and flowering bushes line the narrowstreets. Local residents in brilliantly colored dresses and robesgo about their daily business under a tropical African sun.   One almost expects to see pith-helmeted French army officers andcolonial administrators step from the governor's palace, or emergefrom an afternoon aperitif on the veranda of the Hotel de la Poste.   More likely, however, is the appearance of a young Senegalese inhis Adidas sneakers and running suit, or perhaps a Land-Roverfilled with expatriate aid workers.   Horse-drawn carts still clip-clop through the narrow streets.Their drivers, upon seeing an obviously foreign face, will insistat some length that the visitor needs to be ambulated someplace.   The heart of St. Louis is on an island in the Senegal Riverestuary. It was from here that Gen. Louis Faidherbe ruled over avast chunk of 19th century Africa and ``pacified'' its natives. Theisland is connected by the iron Faidherbe Bridge to the mainlandand by two other bridges to the Langue de Barbarie, a spit of landthat separates the island from the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.   ``St. Louis has been abandoned,'' bemoans Marie Jo Durande, whoruns the 150-year-old Hotel de la Poste.   ``There are a few tourists who do a circuit from Dakar to theCasamance in the south and St. Louis,'' says Ms. Durande in anevening conversation over coffee in a hotel dining room drippingwith atmosphere.   ``Otherwise, it's mostly businessmen and a few backpackers.''   City officials are trying to spruce-up the town and make itattractive to moneyed visitors. A few of the principal historicalbuildings are being restored, or at least repainted. But the placeis crumbling faster than it is being stuck back together, which initself gives it a certain forlorn charm.   A prime example of decay is the once-fine Adamson Museum on theSouth Point, named after 18th century botanist Michel Adamson,author of the eight-volume ``Natural History of Senegal.''   The museum is slowly being swallowed by dust. Examples oftypical Senegalese fauna rot in the display cases, skins fallingaway, stuffing ignominiously hanging out. Interesting exhibits ofcostumes, artifacts, tools and house-building methods of thecountry's many ethnic groups are falling to pieces, the explanatorylabels frequently so yellowed they are illegible.   Abdul Haidara, director of the Center for Research andDocumentation on Senegal that houses the museum, can only shrug hisshoulders and plod on with the little money that is available.   St. Louis was founded in 1659, first as a headquarters forFrench companies plying trade in gum arabic, ivory, leather, goldand slaves, and later a colonial and political capital.   The English snatched it up on several occasions when Europeanwars spilled over into Africa _ for six months in 1693, from 1758to 1779, from 1809 to 1816. As a result, several Armstrongs,O'Haras and Pattersons are numbered among St. Louis families.   When the Estates General met in Paris during the FrenchRevolution, St. Louis sent its famous ``Cahier de Doleances,'' orbook of complaints. It was supposed to be from all of the people,but in reality, according to Haidara, it was a plea from the Frenchand the mixed-race population.   ``I've searched in vain and not found the name of one true St.Louisian in the documents,'' the historian said. ``And the cahiersmainly demanded `freedom of commerce,' which in those days reallymeant the slave trade.''   At one time, St. Louis served as the capital of the colony ofSenegal, the capital of the federation of territories known asFrench West Africa, and capital of Mauritania. The city lost thefirst two titles to Dakar, the booming port with deeper, calmerwater farther to the south, and the third to Nouakchott, builtafter independence in 1960 on a vacant piece of desert 200 milesnorth.   Leaving the island of St. Louis, and its one stoplight winkingforlornly in a particularly useless spot, one enters another worldon the Langue de Barbarie, a teeming African world of bustlingmarkets, aggressive colors and hot sand.   The langue is slowly disappearing.   Moammar Sourang, president of the Chamber of Commerce, says whenhis father wanted to walk to the sea, he had to get up early in themorning to get there by afternoon. Now, he says the Atlantic is athis feet. That's a bit of exaggeration, but the land is wearingaway.   Turning south, one passes through the Guet-Ndar district, 900yards long by 400 yards wide and packed with 18,000 people, mostlyfishermen. The district and the people are poor. St. Louisiansconsider them a crude lot. But the whole area is vibrant and alive,a contrast with the city, which seems to be holding its breath.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
