The austere farm package calls for price freezes or cuts to keepthe EEC's 1988-89 farm budget within a $33.5 billion ceilingimposed by EEC leaders at a summit last February.   Officials said the Greek agricultural minister, Yannis Potakis,threatened to veto the package that had been accepted by his 11 EECpartners if Ignaz Kiechle, the West German delegate and themeeting's chairman, put it to a vote.   Potakis claimed a price boost for Greek farmers would not costthe EEC budget as much as calculated and asked for higher pricesfor Greek farmers.   The EEC commission that drafted the farm budget acknowledged itscalculations might not be correct but said it could not change theentire price scheme to which 11 countries agreed. It said othermembers would ask for additional changes and thus undermine thepackage.   A new meeting may be called while the commission studiespossible concessions to Greece.   The agriculture ministers began their meeting last Monday.Throughout the negotiations the commission made concessions tovarious demands by agreeing to a gradual dismantling of a complexsystem of taxes on exports of farm produce from countries withweaker currencies.   Kiechle could call for another farm ministers meeting before hissix-month term as chairman expires on June 30, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
