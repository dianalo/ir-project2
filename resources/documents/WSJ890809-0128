The insiders, who include Don D. Sykora, president of the company's Houston Power andamp; Light unit, sold their stock at $31.25 to $33 a share, according to reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The price of the stock has trended higher since the sales, closing unchanged yesterday at $34.625, just below its 12-month high.    Four of the five insiders unloaded all their holdings. Mr. Sykora kept a token 15 shares. Their stakes weren't very big to begin with, ranging from 44 to 3,843 shares.    The Houston Industries officials couldn't be reached for comment. Sandra Brendler, spokeswoman for the company, said the stock that the insiders sold was from a terminated Employee Stock Ownership Program. &quot;We discontinued our ESOP {in December 1986}, and these people's shares were subject to a six-month holding requirement.&quot; The insiders sold the holdings &quot;as soon as they were eligible to sell them,&quot; she said.    All the insiders sold between June 16 and July 17. On July 6, Duff andamp; Phelps downgraded Houston Industries' senior debt to triple-B-minus from single-A-minus. Then on Friday, Houston Industries released second-quarter results, which showed a 40% decline in per-share earnings to 45 cents from 75 cents in the year-earlier period.    Daniel Rudakas, a Duff andamp; Phelps analyst who follows the company, said Houston Industries has run into cash-flow problems because of its costly acquisition of some cable television assets.    Mr. Rudakas said he found the stock sales unusual but not worrisome. &quot;I would think that anybody who makes a sufficient paycheck in upper management would buy stock in his own company,&quot; the analyst said. But, in retrospect, the insiders &quot;should have hung onto it -- it's gone up,&quot; he said.    The largest insider sale, according to the SEC filings, was by D. Eugene Simmons, group vice president of power operations, who sold his 3,843 shares for $32 each, or $122,976. If Mr. Simmons had sold yesterday, instead of July 7, the day of the rating downgrade, he would have realized $10,088 more. The other insiders sold much smaller stakes.    What the insiders did with the money &quot;is beyond what the public has a right to know,&quot; said Ms. Brendler of Houston Industries.    ---   FAMILY BUSINESS: Shortly before Williams Cos. reported a second-quarter loss, its former chairman sold a third of his stock in the Tulsa, Okla.-based energy and telecommunications company, SEC filings show.    John H. Williams, a director and cousin of the current chairman, sold 100,000 shares in mid-July for $3.9 million. Last Wednesday, the company reported an unaudited net loss of $5.9 million, or 21 cents a share. Williams stock dipped on the bad news, but has since trended higher. It closed yesterday up 50 cents at $40.375 a share.    Both Mr. Williams and the company declined to comment. Mr. Williams still holds 206,017 Williams shares, directly and indirectly, according to SEC filings.    Foster Corwith, a securities analyst who follows the company for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said there's been a &quot;short-term, negative impact on earnings&quot; from Williams Cos.' recent expansion into the telecommunications business. &quot;But, long-term, we're expecting significant profits.&quot;    ---   STAKE OF GRACE: Now that celebrity money-manager Peter S. Lynch is a director of W.R. Grace andamp; Co., he can't buy shares in the specialty chemical company for his huge Fidelity Magellan fund. But he recently picked up a few shares for himself.    Mr. Lynch bought 1,000 shares of Grace on July 5 for $31,380, according to a filing with the SEC. The purchase followed his election to Grace's board of directors in May. The price of Grace stock has risen more than $3 a share since he made the purchase. Grace closed yesterday at $34.75 a share, up $1.    Mr. Lynch, executive vice president of Fidelity Management andamp; Research Co., said Grace shares had previously been &quot;a small part&quot; of the Magellan fund that he manages. But he said the fund &quot;sold out well before I became a director.&quot; Mr. Lynch said Fidelity policy precludes him from buying the shares for the fund as long as he serves as a director. </TEXT></DOC>
