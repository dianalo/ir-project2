(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's former chief aide today saidhe objected to Bakker's use of the word ``investment'' in a brochureoffering free hotel rooms to $1,000 contributors, but the TVevangelist got his way.   The Rev. Richard Dortch, who pleaded guilty to fraud and dreweight years in prison and $200,000 in fines for his role in the PTLscandal, said Bakker insisted on keeping the word to enticecontributions.   Bakker considered the fund-raising idea an ``inspiration'' fromGod, Dortch said.   Bakker is accused of overbooking his ministry's hotels anddiverting for his own use nearly $4 million raised from PTL``lifetime partners'' _ $1,000 contributors who were promised threenights' lodging a year for life at PTL's Heritage USA theme parknear Fort Mill, S.C.   A parade of witnesses have said they paid the $1,000 only to betold there was no room at the inn.   If found guilty of all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakkercould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5million.   Dortch today testified that Bakker was told at least daily aboutthe ministry's contributions and got updates even when he was ontelevision raising money. Dortch said Bakker kept a notebook withdaily listings of contributions and the number of ``lifetimepartnerships'' sold.   Dortch said that he first heard of the partnerships about threeweeks after joining PTL in 1983 and that he was concerned withbrochures that called the partnerships an ``investment.''   ``I had concern about the word because I had some experience inthe use of that term and I objected to the use of it in thebrochure,'' Dortch said.   Dortch testified a week after being released from a Floridahospital, where he had been held for several days for treatment ofan undisclosed ailment.   Earlier today, the Rev. Don George, a former PTL board member,said Bakker kept the board in the dark about the ministry'sfinancial straits and his six-figure bonuses and gave a rosy reportmonths before his 1987 downfall in a sex and money scandal.   ``I was concerned about the endless fund-raising projects,'' saidGeorge, who resigned over the ministry's fund-raising practices.   ``There never seemed to be a balance period in the ministry whenlarge amounts of money were not being raised on TV.''   George, of Irvine, Texas, joined the board in 1985 and quit inFebruary 1987, the month before Bakker resigned. He said Bakker gavethe board a financial overview at a meeting in January 1987.   ``He gave a positive report. It was upbeat and encouraging,''George said.   On Wednesday, jurors were told that Bakker and his wife, Tammy,were given more than $3 million in bonuses as the ministry narrowlyavoided financial collapse in the mid-1980s.   Former PTL finance director Peter Bailey read from more than 70memos he had sent the evangelist between 1983 and 1987 detailing theTV ministry's chronic cash problems.   ``We are continuing to operate far in excess of what is comingin,'' Bailey read from a memo dated April 16, 1986, two weeks afterBakker got a $200,000 bonus. ``The contributions are flat. We canhave all the financial controls in the world but if we don't livewithin our means it doesn't mean anything.''   In testimony today, George said the largest bonus he ever votedfor Bakker was $150,000, despite minutes from a November 1986meeting at which Bakker was given a $500,000 bonus. The amount ofthe bonus, as well as $150,000 for Bakker's wife, are in a memoadded to the board minutes.   ``Did you ever vote for a $500,000 bonus for the Rev. Bakker,''prosecutor Deborah Smith asked.   ``No,'' George responded.</TEXT></DOC>
