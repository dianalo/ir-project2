 Nantucket's Clipper rose to prominencelargely because it extends the dBASE language.andP;  It gives developers a uniqueand flexible tool that stretches dBASE to its limits.andP;  But Clipper's soleclaim to that power may be ending.andP;  Those of you expecting a Fox Softwareresponse to dBASE IV will find it, but be prepared for much more.andP;  FoxPro isan extremely ambitious product that'll try to give developers and users aninterface, enhanced language, windowed environment, report writer, andperformance superior to dBASE IV, Clipper, Quicksilver, and FoxBASE+.andP;  That'sthe promise.andP;  We won't know if they'll succeed until we get a chance to trythe finished product.andP;  While we wait, here's a preview of FoxPro.andM;FoxPro foundationsandM;FoxBASE+/Mac, which turned out to be a superior Macintosh developmentplatform, was almost an accident.andP;  A couple of years ago Fox Software wasgoing to create a Windows environment version of FoxBASE+, but it didn't seemlike an opportune time.andP;  Instead, they decided to explore the Macintoshenvironment.andP;  And an exploration it was.andP;  They perceived the Mac product as amajor gamble.andP;  They didn't see much potential, because the Macintosh marketwasn't large enough, and the Mac wasn't a mature environment with all thenecessary tools.andP;  Fox was fully prepared to consider the Macintosh version anexperiment-a learning experience.andP;  After all, Ashton-Tate's dBASE/Mac andNantucket's McMax had a significant head start.andP;  As it turned out,FoxBASE+/Mac exceeded Fox's expectations and filled a void in the Macintoshworld.andM;Fox Software's President David Fulton believes FoxPro could not have beendone if they hadn't created the Macintosh product.andP;  FoxBASE+/Mac caught on bybeing the right product at the right time.andP;  In fact, Fulton thinks thecorporate world came to know Fox Software mainly because of their Macproduct.andP;  Large companies already committed to Ashton-Tate's dBASE for DOSmachines weren't able to stick with Ashton-Tate for their Macintoshes.andO;dBASE/Mac isn't what it sounds like--it's not a Macintosh version of dBASE.andO;FoxBASE+/Mac is, and that's what corporate buyers were looking for.andM;In turn, creating FoxBASE+/Mac inspired Fox Software's developers.andP;  If theFoxBASE+/Mac features favored by Macintosh users could be added to the DOSversion, Fox would be onto something.andP;  As a result, Fox began inventingMac-like enhancements for FoxBASE+ while they developed FoxBASE+/Mac version2.0.andP;  Because no true blending of a dBASE-style product with the specialqualities of the Macintosh existed, they needed to invent quite a bit.andP;  Asthey did, it became clear that most of the new features could, and should, beadded to the DOS version.andM;You may be thinking, wait a minute!andP;  The Mac's major capability is itsgraphical screen interface.andP;  Will FoxPro require a graphics-capable PC?andP;  Notat all.andP;  In fact, Fulton thinks the Macintosh's advantages are misunderstood.andO;He believes the essential part of the Macintosh interface isn't graphics atall, but the fact that it's event-driven.andP;  Presenting the screen in agraphical icon/image fashion is an interesting, but secondary, issue.andM;(By the term &quot;even-driven,&quot; Fulton is referring to the Mac practice ofallowing a user any number of options-operating a window or even severalwindows, selecting an icon, etc., all of which the program must be preparedto handle at any time.andP;  This differs from the dBASE/FoxBASE+ tradition ofcommand-driven operation, where the user simply designates a single commandor operation.)andM;Concluding that an event-driven environment was fundamentally more powerfulled to redesigning FoxBASE+.andP;  Fulton sees the key challenge as providingevent-driven programming, which he thinks is a very different, difficultproblem.andP;  Part of his solution is FoxPro's mouse support.andP;  According toFulton, the mouse is very important to new users.andP;  An object- oricon-oriented screen is easier to grasp and use.andP;  With a screen full ofobjects (choices) and a handful of mouse, users can move around andarbitrarily select from a variety of possible actions.andP;  Fulton feels this isdesirable-so desirable that the new FoxPro will offer just about everymouse-style point-and-click capability of FoxBASE+/Mac, but on acharacter-based screen.andP;  This may turn out to be an advantage, because Fultonsays the character-based PC version of FoxPro is faster than thegraphics-based FoxBASE+/Mac, even though both have much the same style,approach, and features.andM;Fulton calls FoxPro's object-oriented interface a major advantage fordevelopers and users.andP;  But object orientation, he asserts, has limits.andP;  Otherfirms claim to be taking object orientation even further, promising thatentire applications can be built by simply selecting components from acollection of objects.andP;  Fulton thinks a total reliance on objects won't matchthe expectations.andP;  He argues that if a database product doesn't have a strongprocedural language, it'll run out of horsepower (as he feels Paradox andR:BASE do).andP;  Fulton adds that no development language can be important if itdoesn't offer facilities to create almost any imaginable businessapplication.andP;  He agrees with those who see the dBASE language as the COBOL ofthe PC world.andP;  Why is the dBASE language so popular?andP;  &quot;It's a humanlanguage,&quot; he concludes.andP;  &quot;It has its lumps, but it is accessible.andP;  The samegoes for BASIC and COBOL.andP;  C, however, is not a human language.&quot;andM;So, even though FoxPro will do much more without programming, look for FoxSoftware to continue to enhance the language with new, more powerful commandsand functions.andP;  The pace-setting evolution of FoxBASE+/Mac will alsocontinue.andP;  In fact, Fulton reveals that &quot;the Mac product is our technologicalleader.andP;  Many of our designs are taken from the Mac.&quot;andP;  Wherever FoxPro isgoing, FoxBASE+/Mac is likely to get there first.andP;  Fulton says thatdeveloping similar Macintosh and DOS products points to the advantage ofhaving their programmers work in both environments.andP;  He observes that otherfirms seem to lack their ambidexterity and the resulting cross-pollination ofideas and techniques.andP;  And, if applications are truly interchangeable betweenDOS and Macintosh versions, FoxPro could be the catalyst to bring PCs andMacs into a more peaceful coexistence.andM;Fox Software is on a roll, with ambitious plans to support severalenvironments.andP;  As present FoxBASE+ runs on the PC, the Macintosh, andUNIX/XENIX.andP;  Coming, unannounced but likely, is FoxPro support forWindows/386, Presentation Manager, and such UNIX/XENIX graphical platforms asOpen Look and Open Desktop.andM;FoxPro 1.0andM;Remember that the pre-release FoxPro is a product in transition.andP;  The productyou'll receive in late summer will most certainly have gone through at leastone more overhaul.andM;Like Nantucket has done with Clipper, FoxPro will deviate from the pathAshton-Tate staked out for dBASE IV.andP;  dBASE IV programs will execute underFoxPro, but the reverse will only be true if the programmer ignores thefeatures that Fox Software sees as powerful and useful and adds to theirdBASE.andP;  As in FoxBASE+, dBASE IV indexes will be read but not directlysupported.andP;  Fox Software claims the dBASE index structure is too slow.andO;FoxPro will automatically convert dBASE IV NDX and MDX indexes to a specialFoxPro format.andM;SpeedandM;Expect FoxPro to be fast.andP;  Fulton promises performance as much as six toseven times faster than dBASE IV.andP;  He described tests on an early version ofFoxPro that ran almost twice as fast as FoxBASE+ 2.10 and more than threetimes faster than dBASE IV 1.0.andP;  These numbers will most certainly change,but Fox Software developers claim to have found ways to add features, shrinkcode size, reduce memory requirements, and increase execution speed as muchas three times -- all at the same time.andP;  Screen write speed should be twiceas fast as FoxBASE+ 2.10 and three to four times faster than dBASE IV.andO;Contrary to the trend in hardware requirements, Fox Software claims FoxProwill run on a 512K XT-class computer.andM;FoxPro will be smarter, too.andP;  Fulton hopes to have FoxPro automatically takeadvantage of whatever environment it's in, such as Windows/386, Desqview, andas much LIM 4.0 expanded memory as it finds.andP;  And unlike the present version,FoxPro will use all expanded RAM available.andM;InterfaceandM;Because FoxPro's screen interface will be Mac-like, a mouse will be anoptional but handy way to interact with it.andP;  Fulton points out that the mouseinterface means developers and users won't have to memorize keystrokes.andO;FoxPro's screen is strictly character-based, but it can take advantage of EGAand VGA modes to show many more characters on screen.andM;WindowsandM;FoxPro &quot;does windows&quot; and, unlike dBASE IV, the developer can allow users todynamically resize and move windows.andP;  Fulton thinks programmers will lovehaving an input window, output window, and debugging window simultaneouslyon-screen.andM;Report and label writerandM;FoxPro includes a combination report and label writer with desktop publishingqualities.andP;  It's very similar to the FoxBASE+/Mac 2.0 report writer andpromises to satisfy every complaint about the shortcomings of FoxBASE+ 2.10'sreport writer.andM;A multi-band approach provides headers and footers, multiple levels oforganization and totaling, and complex relations.andP;  Put just about anythingyou want in the report, in multi-band fashion, intermix the fonts, andpreview the report page on screen.andP;  Unlike current FoxBASE+ report FRM files,FoxPro report layouts can be saved separately from the data contents, whichwill make them easy to reuse.andM;Unlike dBASE IV, the FoxPro report writer won't create a PRG file, but itwill execute dBASE IV report PRGs.andP;  Fulton says you can't get performanceusing dBASE IV's approach of having the report writer write a program thatwrites the report.andP;  He says this approach wastes disk space.andP;  He also pointsout that to revise and regenerate a report at the client's site requires afull copy (rather than a runtime) of dBASE IV.andP;  I argued that dBASE IV'smethod is an advantage, because producing a PRG allows the programmer tofurther enhance the report.andP;  But Fulton sees that step as necessary only whenthe report writer is inadequate.andP;  Besides, he points out, if the built-infunctions of the FoxPro report writer aren't enough, just use a user definedfunction (UDF).andP;  A fox report can contain UDFs which can be complete programsthat do almost anything.andP;  Fulton calls FoxPro's report writer &quot;the best inexistence,&quot; with all the features of Randamp;R (a stand-alone dBASE report writerby Concentric Data Systems, Inc.) and more.andP;  Report layouts can even be movedbetween FoxPro and FoxBASE+/Mac.andP;  Any elements that rely on Mac graphicsfeatures will automatically be converted to a similar character-based formatand vice versa.andM;UDFsandM;In FoxBASE+, UDFs are--to be charitable--limited.andP;  Not so in FoxPro.andP;  UDFswill be allowed in reports and almost anywhere else.andP;  One possible exceptionis index expressions.andP;  Allowing a UDF in an index requires that the indexmaintenance routine constantly check the status of the UDF.andP;  This has severeperformance implications that FoxSoftware may choose to avoid.andP;  Most (but notall) benefits of indexing on a UDF can be accomplished in less detrimentalways.andP;  Fox Software will publish an interface allowing developers to addassembler and C routines.andP;  This may create a lively third-party market inFoxPro add-on libraries.andM;Memo fieldsandM;As many disappointed dBASE and FoxBASE+ users discovered, memo fields soundbetter than they work.andP;  Clipper has a lock on useful memo field manipulation(with dBASE IV close behind), but FoxPro promises to up the ante by removingalmost all limits on using a memo field.andP;  Among other things, a memo fieldcan be stored in a standard memory variable which can be processed like anyother memory variable (e.g., in functions, parameters, and GETs.)andM;MultiuserandM;The multiuser version of FoxBASE+ 2.10 has been criticized for not having theamazing speed of the single-user version.andP;  According to Fulton, FoxPro willcorrect this by redesigning the house-keeping activities that underlie thenetwork product.andM;EditorandM;The built-in FoxPro text editor promses to be loaded with features.andP;  Becauseit's available in a FoxPro window, Fulton thinks it might be good enough tosupplant favorites like dBRIEF.andP;  For example, a programmer can have severaledit windows open at the same time without ever leaving the FoxProenvironment.andM;Developer issuesandM;FoxPro 1.0 will be packaged as the base product, with an add-on developer'smodule for using the runtime or generating an EXE.andP;  The EXE-generationcapability will be supplied as a free upgrade to the developer version two orthree months after FoxPro appears.andP;  Fulton sees EXE generation as a packagingissue, claiming it doesn't affect how the program runs, just how it looks ondisk.andP;  There'll be no linking.andP;  Fox will use a new entity called a &quot;project&quot;to hold the programs that make up an application.andP;  Within a project, FoxProwill resolve linkages between object code.andP;  This method is commonly used inthe Macintosh environment but it's new to DOS.andP;  One major benefit is that theprogrammer doesn't have to worry about overlays.andP;  The user writes a PRG,which becomes a PRO when compiled (no more FOX files).andP;  FoxPro willauto-compile as needed, without batch compile.andP;  I would prefer to have both,with auto-compile an option under my control.andM;Fox Software currently supports developers on the IDBUG BBS and CompuServe.andO;They'll continue providing free technical support and will add non-freepriority support.andP;  In addition, Fox Software will hold a developersconference on Sept. 13-15 in Toledo.andM;The upgrade policy, pricing and release date of FoxPro have yet to bedetermined.andM;FoxPro 2.0andM;Version 2.0 is scheduled for the first half of next year and will addadvanced database management features, principally SQL and central serversupport.andP;  Some form of data dictionary is also likely to appear in thisversion.andM;SQLandM;Fulton sees the growing clamor for SQL as an interesting challenge.andP;  FoxProdevelopers are working out a way to present SQL features to people who aren'ttechnicians.andP;  Fulton promises that FoxPro will merge dBASE and SQL into a newsynthesis in a way that others believe isn't possible.andM;FoxPro 2.0 will include full support for SQL.andP;  For Software is writing itsSQL engine for local use on stand-alone PCs.andP;  Rejecting the SET SQL ON/OFFapproach of dBASE IV, Fulton intends to give FoxPro the intelligence todistinguish between SQL and dBASE commands automatically.andP;  By allowingintermixed commands, the programmer won't lose access to dBASE commands whilein SQL mode (as dBASE IV requires).andP;  This way, the developer can moveexisting FoxPro applications into SQL slowly by inserting SQL commands wherethey offer the most benefit.andM;SQL and FoxServerandM;Database vendors are stampeding to add client/server architecture to theirproducts.andP;  Put simply, this splits the database manager engine into twocomponents and runs one of them in the server's RAM.andP;  By processing datarequests on the server, the information transmitted across the network canoften be reduced dramatically.andP;  Reduced network traffic increases responsetime.andP;  Some firms, comparing PC networks to mainframe systems, are trying toposition the client/server approach as the only legitimate way to managedatabases on a network.andP;  Fulton, who likes to cut to the essence of a topic,puts it more simply.andP;  &quot;Server database design is a performance enhancer.andO;There's no other reason to have one, other than to be fashionable.&quot;andM;Fulton anticipates that server performance will become an issue--one heintends to meet head-on.andP;  Last November, Fox Software announced a plan tolicense rather than build a central server.andP;  Whose server can keep up withFoxPro?andP;  Novell's.andP;  Novell, like Fox Software, has built their reputation onspeed.andP;  That's a key reason why Fox Software has decided to use NetWare SQLas the basis for FoxServer.andM;Fox is the first company to OEM Netware SQL.andP;  (OEM stands for &quot;originalequipment manufacturer&quot;, meaning one company puts their name on anothercompany's product.)andP;  NetWare SQL uses Novell's Btrieve database serverengine.andP;  The FoxServer arrangement means that users can get both the frontand back ends directly from Fox Software.andM;FoxServer will be a superset of NetWare SQL with added functions supportingFoxPro.andP;  (FoxServer support will be added to FoxPro/Mac later.)andP;  FoxPro can'trun standard Netware SQL, since parts of FoxPro will be embedded in theserver engine.andP;  For example, the best place to execute an index buildingroutine is on the server, since that's where the data and the index arestored.andP;  NetWare SQL doesn't know how to use FoxPro indexes, so putting theindex maintenance code in the server engine makes it more powerful--andnon-standard.andP;  Any program that supports NetWare SQL (Novell claims 18,000developers and a long and growing list of major products) will also work withFoxServer.andP;  Because FoxServer will store data in Btrieve files, data will beaccessible by any of the programs that plan to support standard NetWare SQL.andO;But only FoxServer will support FoxPro.andM;The relationship is non-exclusive on both sides, meaning Fox Software can,and probably will, support other popular SQL servers, while Novell willprobably cut deals with other vendors who want to embed the NetWare SQLengine inside product-specific servers.andP;  A Novell network won't be necessaryto run standard multiuser FoxPro (which will support just about any network,just as FoxBASE+/LAN does now).andP;  But since NetWare SQL runs only on NetWare,the Novell version of FoxServer won't be compatible with any other network.andO;Fox Software has stated that FoxPro support for other network operatingsystems is likely if the market demands them.andM;Netware SQL requires NetWare versions 2.1x and above.andP;  This means users ofthe four-user Novell network, ELS I, won't be supported, since ELS I is basedon the 1986-vintage Netware 2.0a.andP;  In fact, Novell has announced an August 31deadline for upgrading Advanced Netware 2.0a (other than ELS I) at asubstantial discount (do it!).andP;  Presumably Novell will evolve ELS I into a2.1x version by the time FoxServer and other NetWare SQL applications hit themarket.andP;  (100-user Advanced Netware is Macintosh-compatible 2.15, eight-userELS II is at non-Mac version 2.12.andP;  Novell likes to hold the cheaper, lowercapacity products at an older version to give users two reasons to buy.)andM;NetWare SQL currently sells for $595.andP;  The price of FoxServer has not yetbeen determined.andM;Where's the proof?andM;David Fulton is a persuasive man with an appealing vision of where the FoxSoftware flavor of dBASE needs to go.andP;  FoxPro sounds electrifying.andP;  Ofcourse, so did dBASE IV.andP;  The proof is on the disk.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
