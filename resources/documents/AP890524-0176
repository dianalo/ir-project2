Under this year's programs, farmers will idle 29.2 millionacres, little more than half of the 54.2 million acres contractedto be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs, officialssaid.   Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1989 idledacreage would represent an area larger than the state ofPennsylvania.   To be eligible for federal price support and related benefits,farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres fromcrop production and put the land in conservation uses that helpprotect the soil.   Last year's drought cut production severely, triggering highergrain prices and a drain on U.S. stockpiles. The department easedidling requirements for this year's crops in an effort to rebuildinventories.   The idled or ``diverted'' acres signed up for 1989 included:corn, 10 million acres, down from 28 million signed up for 1988;sorghum, 2.8 million acres, down from 4.1 million; barley, 2.1million acres, down from 2.9 million; and oats, 300,000 acres,unchanged.   In all, feed grains acres signed up to be idled under the 1989programs totaled 15.2 million acres, down from 28.2 millioncontracted last year.   Additionally, wheat farmers signed up to idle 9.5 million acresthis year, compared with 22.8 million acres in 1988; cotton, 3.4million acres, up from 2.1 million; and rice, 1.1 million acres,unchanged.   The USDA report said farmers enrolled 168.1 million acres offeed grain, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1989 program, whichrepresented 76.3 percent of the 220.3 million acres in the nationalbase area for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 168.1million acres that were enrolled.   Last year's gross enrollment was 187.8 million acres, whichrepresented 83.4 per cent of the 1988 national base of 225.2million acres.</TEXT></DOC>
