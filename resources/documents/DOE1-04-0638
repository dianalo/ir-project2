As with /sup 194,196,198/Pt,it is found that Q(2/sub 1//sup +/) for /sup 192/Pt is clearly positive,having the value 0.55 (21) e x b. The value obtained for B(E2; 0/sub1//sup +/ -andgt; 2/sub 1//sup +/) is 1.833 (20) e/sup 2/b/sup 2/. The resultobtained for Q(2/sub 1//sup +/) supports the view that the prolate-to-oblatetransition in the platinum isotopes is quite different from that in theosmium isotopes. The shape change is more sensitive to Z than N. Theresults are compared with the predictions of various nuclear models.</TEXT></DOC>
