The proposed rules, which will be voted on by the SEC late this year after comment by the public, are a compromise between current law and more-lenient rules proposed by the agency last December.    They would essentially exempt middle-management executives from insider-filing requirements. At the same time, insiders who exercise options to buy company stock would be allowed to report the transaction to the SEC much later than the current rules allow.    The proposal was adopted after an acrimonious, three-hour debate during a public meeting here yesterday. The SEC's attempt to narrow the scope of its insider rules last December prompted a flood of mail, much of it critical, from investors and others who consider filings by insiders a valuable stock-picking tool.    Essentially, the SEC proposals would require only top executives, officers who set policy or head divisions, and executives who oversee company finances, to file reports on their transactions in company stock. Exempted, for example, would be vice presidents who aren't directly involved in setting corporate policy.    SEC officials said they expected a significant decrease in insider filings if the proposal is adopted. &quot;The problem is really that of vice presidents; at banks and brokerage firms everybody's a vice president,&quot; said Brian Lane, special counsel in the SEC division of corporation finance.    Many investors watch buying and selling by corporate insiders for a clue to the outlook for a company's business and the direction of its stock price. If the SEC eliminates filings by middle-management, some investors are concerned that they won't be able to spot telltale clusters of trading activity in which more than one officer or director is buying or selling in a short period of time.    For example, of the 20 stocks that insiders sold most actively in the past eight weeks, according to SEC records, 16 would not have appeared under the new rules. &quot;You don't see a pattern unless you see a lot of people buying or selling,&quot; said Theodore Schlissel, a New York investor who wrote the SEC to complain about the first set of proposals.    While the proposed rules would make life easier for some executives by exempting them from reporting, they would also be tougher on insiders who are required to file reports. Companies would be required to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file the required reports on time.    The SEC said 35% of corporate insiders now file their reports late. The threat of public embarrassment should be a &quot;significant deterrent&quot; to late filings, Mr. Lane said.    In a significant shift from its earlier position, the SEC backed away from a plan that would have given insiders a slightly longer grace period to file their reports. Currently, insiders must disclose transactions in their companies' shares by the 10th of the month following the trade. Under the proposal, that deadline would remain. </TEXT></DOC>
