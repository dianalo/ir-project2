That's bigger than the fiscal 1987 deficit of $149.66 billion, but well below the record $221.2 billion deficit of the year before.    The federal deficit would be far larger if not for the Social Security system's growing surplus. Social Security ran a surplus of $38.8 billion in fiscal 1988, up from $19.57 billion the year before. The rest of the government's operations were $193.9 billion in the red last year, compared with $169.23 billion the year before.    The federal government has run a deficit every year since 1969. By all projections, it's likely to continue running deficits for the next several years unless substantial changes in government policy are made.    The Reagan administration forecasts a $122.69 billion deficit for the current fiscal year -- including a projected Social Security surplus of $51.22 billion.    The government took in $908.95 billion in fiscal 1988, which ended Sept. 30, up 6.4% from the previous fiscal year. Individual income-tax receipts rose 2.2% to $401.18 billion, while corporate taxes climbed 12% to $94.2 billion.    The Reagan administration said the 1986 tax-overhaul law added $21.5 billion to federal revenues in fiscal 1987 but reduced tax collections by $4.5 billion in fiscal 1988.    Total federal outlays were $1.06 trillion in fiscal 1988, up 6% from the year before. Defense spending came to $281.94 billion, up 2.9%. Medicare outlays were $87.68 billion, up 7.4%. And the interest tab on the federal debt came to $214.15 billion, up 9.6%.    The final 1988 budget deficit of $155.1 billion is nearly $3 billion larger than the administration had predicted in July, primarily because individual income-tax receipts were lower than projected. It also exceeds the $144 billion target in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    The Treasury said the government ran a surplus of $10.21 billion in September, compared with a surplus of $15.2 billion in September 1987. Higher corporate tax receipts were primarily responsible for the surplus. </TEXT></DOC>
