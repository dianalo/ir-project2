LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pilot of a Boeing 737 was questioned againtoday by investigators trying to determine why his plane'sapparently undamaged right engine was shut down long before the jetcrashed, while the burning left engine remained in operation.   The Civil Aviation Authority said it would order stepped-upinspections of engines on three types of airplanes as a result ofthe crash Sunday of the British Midland Airways jetliner.   The new inspections will apply to Boeing 737-400s, the type ofaircraft involved the crash, as well as Boeing 737-300s and AirbusA320s, which have similar engines, the authority said in a statement.   The statement came after the Transport Department recommendedmore frequent inspections of Boeing 737 engines. A communique issuedby the department's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it wasstill looking into the possibility that both engines ``might havesuffered a related failure.''   It did not refer to suggestions in the British media that thepilot shut down the wrong engine when a fire alarm went off.   The reasons for shutting down the engine ``are not yet clear andare still under investigation,'' the comunique said.   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, whose back and legs were broken inthe crash, was interviewed for 45 minutes at Leicester RoyalInfirmary, said the hospital's deputy general manager, CarolHenshall. Hunt answered preliminary questions Tuesday.   The jet plunged into an embankment a half-mile short of therunway at East Midlands Airport in central England, where it wastrying to make an emergency landing. Forty-four people died and 82were injured.   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said Hunt had reported a fire inthe right engine of the new Boeing 737-400 shortly after it took offfrom London's Heathrow Airport for Belfast.   Channon told the House of Commons Tuesday that investigatorsfound evidence of fire in the left engine, but no evidence of fireor mechanical damage in the right engine.   Britain's tabloid newspapers concluded today that Hunt hadmistakenly shut down the right engine, believing it was on fire,instead of the left engine.   ``Fatal Error'' said the Daily Star; ``Pilot Shut Off the WrongEngine'' said the Sun; ``Error on the Flight Deck'' said Today.   The British Airline Pilots Association called the newspaperreports ``outrageous'' and ``without a shred of evidence.'' Aviationexperts said it was highly unlikely the pilot could have confusedthe two engines, given the cockpit layout and the system ofdoublechecks between pilot and co-pilot.   Mrs. Henshall said that after Hunt's meeting with investigatorshe ``is obviously a lot happier that they have all the relevantfacts.''   She said some of the ``wilder headlines'' had been kept from thepilot but he had been made aware by friends and colleagues of thenews reports.   Asked if Hunt had denied them, Mrs. Henshall said: ``That is acomment I couldn't make.''   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m. Government sources, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said Hunt reported at 8:06 p.m.: ``I have anengine on fire.'' Then, at 8:14 p.m., the sources said he toldtraffic control: ``I am shutting down the starboard (right) engine.''   The plane crashed 12 minutes later at 8:26 p.m.   Channon refused Tuesday to speculate on what happened, saying hewouldn't rule out anything including pilot error or sabotage, thoughhe said ``I don't think sabotage is very likely.''   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air AccidentsInvestigation Branch, put the odds against a double-engine failureat 10 million-to-1.   Group Captain John Tritton of the Guild of Air Pilots said ``Ifind it unbelievable'' that the pilot identified the wrong engine onfire ``because the checks are done so carefully by both pilots.''   Asked if the warning system itself could go wrong, Capt. JohnGuntrip, also a guild member, said: ``It is possible. It has beenknown in the past. There have very occasionally been false firewarnings on aircraft.''   Aviation experts say the investigation into the fire in the leftengine will focus on the possibility of a broken turbine blade,mechanical failure, contaminated fuel, problems in the fuel feedsystem, faulty maintenance and an explosion in the engine'scombustion chamber.   The plane broke into three main sections. Recovery crews preparedtoday to remove the crumpled center section, including the two wingsand two engines, from the embankment beside England's mainnorth-south M1 highway about 100 miles north of London.   The cockpit, tail section and ``black boxes'' which recordcockpit flight data and conversations have already been taken to thegovernment Air Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough,outside London.</TEXT></DOC>
