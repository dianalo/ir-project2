(products).andO;Product:   WordPerfect Office (Office automation software) (productspecifications).andO;Topic:     Office AutomationSoftware PackagesLocal Area Networks.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THERE IS A TELEVISION show that specializes in trying to find the unfindable.andO;Its episodes have such intriguing titles as &quot;In Search of the Lost City ofTroy,&quot; &quot;In Search of Noah's Ark,&quot; and &quot;In Search of Dan Quayle.&quot; For those ofus who have watched the PC revolution move users from integrated officesystems (IOSs) to PC LANs, the current saga could be called, &quot;In Search ofthe LAN Office.&quot;andM;When PC LANs first appeared, users were very happy to share a printer or ahard disk.andP;  As users became more sophisticated, they began to realize thepotential of LANs as departmental solutions.andP;  Electronic mail was added tofile- and printcr-sharing, and a number of &quot;groupware&quot; products began toappear, each with the goat of increasing group productivity.andM;These products increased the range of services available to the LAN user,though their acceptance has been by no means widespread.andP;  In fact, most ofthese, particularly The Coordinator (Action Technologies) and Higgins(recently acquired by Enable Software), have been sold as enhanced E-mailsystems, with some of their other features such as To-do lists, PersonalCalendar, Scheduler, File Manager, and Conversation Manager being implementedonly haphazardly.andM;The key impediment to the acceptance of these products has been that usersare forced to change their working methods.andP;  Users get computers on theirdesks because they have a job to do.andP;  Many work in a single application only,with a spreadsheet, word processor, or database making up the completeenvironment.andP;  For some, it is a large concession to leave their environmentsto read E-mail once a day.andP;  Many of diem, insulated by batch files orhome-grown menuing systems, have never seen a &quot;Candgt;&quot; prompt.andM;What is missing is a seamless way for users to go back and forth betweentheir major applications and the services that are now available on the LAN,i.e., a LAN version of die host-based integrated office system, popularizedby all-In-1, Wang Office, CEO, Uniplex, et al.andM;However, any vendor trying to implement such an IOS on a LAN platform isverylikely to meet with great resistance if the users are forced to use dievendor's choice of PC applications rather than their own favorites.andM;Thus, we are faced with a dilemma: Users want more services and moreintegration without giving up the flexibility that the PC platform providesand certainly without significantly changing the ways in which they work.andM;Enter WordPerfect OfficeandM;WordPerfect Office is the first product to adequately address the specificissues of implementing an IOS on the PC LAN platform.andP;  As a word processorvendor, WordPerfect Corporation has no illusions that people buy PCs to sendelectronic mail.andP;  Great attention has been paid to users' ability to do theirdaily work in the normal manner, with the additional services made availableto them without being intrusive.andP;  The product has also been made extensible,thus permitting users the flexibility that they have come to expect from thePC environment.andP;  In addition, WordPerfect Office has been designed to meetusers' demands for a multiple platform (in terms of both vendor and operatingsystem office system.andP;  The product has been planned for a large number ofplatforms, with versions currently available on PC LANs, Digital VAXs, andData General machines.andM;WordPerfect Office is essentially a set of office services that can beaccessed from a Shell, which also permits access to a set of applications.andO;The services revolve around the nucleus of electronic mail, personalcalendaring, and group scheduling.andM;A LITTLE HISTORY.andP;  WordPerfect Office is actually an outgrowth of WordPerfectLibrary, a set of personal productivity tools-Calendar, Calculator, FileManager, Notebook, Macro/ Program Editors-which are all called from anextensible Shell.andP;  According to WordPerfect Corporation, WordPerfect Librarywas developed as a set of &quot;cute and inexpensive&quot; services, aimed atindividual users.andM;After the release of this product, WordPerfect Corporation's Data Generalgroup (WordPerfect itself was first developed on DG equipment) was approachedby the Federal Department of Justice, which was looking for an officeproduct, specifically mail and scheduling, as an alternative to DataGeneral's CEO.andP;  WordPerfect Corporation's developers took the name and theShell from WordPerfect Library, and added the mail and scheduling functionsto it for use on the DG platforms.andP;  The functions of the two &quot;Libraries&quot; werethen merged for the PC LAN and the other platforms, and renamed WordPerfectOffice.andM;WordPerfect Corporation sees the move into &quot;office automaton&quot; as a naturalone.andP;  According to President Alan Ashton, computer users have two basicneeds: to write down ideas and to communicate them.andP;  Having very successfullyaddressed the first need with WordPerfect, the company decided to go afterthe second by building upon the WordPerfect Library program and specificallyadding electronic mail.andP;  A corollary of electronic communication isface-to-face meetings.andP;  Thus, the company perceived an integrated personalcalendar/group scheduler as the second keystone of an Office product.andM;FEATURES.andP;  The features of WordPerfect Office, though all based on the twinpillars of electronic mail and calendar/scheduler, are somewhat dependentupon the platform upon which it is being implemented.andP;  While the goal is toprovide equivalent functionality across all of the major platforms, somedevelopment, particularly on the DOS product, is well ahead of others.andM;This is caused, in part, by the vertically based internal structure ofWordPerfect Corporation, which has separate development and marketing teamsfor DOS, V AX, DG, 68000 (Mac and Atari), Unix, Presentation Manager, and IBMmachines.andP;  For WordPerfect Office, development generally takes place first onthe DOS PC.andP;  When a feature is ready, it is given to the other product groupsto port to their platforms.andP;  Thus, the other platforms tend to be ageneration behind the PC.andM;Interestingly, the vast majority of code on all platforms is in assemblylanguage; the movement to the more portable C language is just beginning.andM;Given this vertical orientation, the best way to look at the current stateand future direction of WordPerfect Office is platform by platform.andP;  Witheach platform, we will examine the current features, discuss the direction ofnext-generation features, and give an indication of how WordPerfect Officefits within the competition.andM;WordPefect Office for PC LANsandM;WordPerfect Office is most developed and most impressive on the DOS platform.andO;The product is able to overcome many of the limitations of DOS in a mannerthat has heretofore been unavailable to DOS users.andM;FEATURES.andP;  The PC network version of WordPerfect Office runs on most LANssupporting DOS 3.1 file-locking, including Novell NetWare, 3Com 3+, BanyanVINES, ATandamp;T StarLAN, IBM PC LAN and Token-Ring, 10Net, and Torus Tapestry.andO;The interface, familiar to WordPerfect users, is function-key driven andgenerally requires a template to find all of the functions.andP;  WordPerfectCorporation has not implementd a graphical user interface or mouse support onthe DOS platform.andM;Currently, the DOS version provides the following modules:andM;* Calculator * NotebookandM;* Calendar * Program EditorandM;* Electronic Mail * SchedulerandM;* File Manager * ShellandM;* Macro EditorandM;(Those who look closely will notice that this is the same list as theindividual-oriented WordPerfect Library, with the addition of thegroup-oriented Electronic Mail and Scheduler.)andM;The Sehll.andP;  The most impressive part of the implementation is the Shell.andP;  TheShell, like most shells, is the user's access point for applications andservices.andP;  From the WordPerfect Office Shell, the user touches a singleletter (M for Mail, A for Appointment calendar, S for Scheduler, etc.) toinitiate the loading of the desired program.andM;The Shell concept has been taken further by WordPerfect Corporation than ithas by any of its competitors on the DOS platform.andP;  The two key areas wherethis has been done are the extensibility of the Shell and the ability tocontext-switch (hot key) between the applications and the office serviceswithout having to exit any of them.andP;  The Shell, being extensible, allowsusers to add their applications of choice to the menu.andP;  For example, if Iwant to use WordPerfect as my word processor, I can; if I want to useMultiMate, Word, or XyWrite, I also can; or I can have all of them availablefrom the Shell and hot-kcy between them.andM;Any application can be added to the Shell.andP;  If the added application has thefacility to exit to DOS, WordPerfect Office can intercept this, bringing dieuser back to the Shell without closing the application.andP;  Another Shellapplication or service can then be run.andP;  This can be streamlined by the useof &quot;Shell Macros,&quot; which allow the user to put the &quot;go to shell&quot; sequence ina macro that can be called at any time ftom within the application.andP;  This isnormally done with the Alt-Shift-Space keys.andP;  In order to directly hotkeybetween applications, the user need only substitute the letter designation onthe menu for the Space key to be instantly in the other application.andP;  If theother application is already running, it comes up exactly at the point whereit had been suspended.andM;A word about the term &quot;instantly&quot;: As we all know, running multiple programsunder the DOS operating system is not exactly easy.andP;  WordPerfect Officehandles its memory management by using existing memory, then expanded memory(if available), then disk space to swap programs in and out.andP;  Given enoughmemory and/or disk space, an unlimited number of programs canbe &quot;running&quot;simultaneously.andP;  How fast one moves between programs is generally a functionof where the desired application has been stored.andP;  If it is in memory, themove is virtually instantaneous.andP;  If it has been swapped to disk, the movecan take a couple of seconds.andP;  How much these seconds interrupt the user'sworkflow is a subjective but very important issue (see our view in &quot;AWordPerfect Office for PC LANs Test Drive&quot; below).andM;WordPerfect Office adds another integrating function between applications.andO;Though not supporting direct data exchange (a la MS Windows), the program hasa cut-and-paste feature that is available from any application launched fromthe Shell.andP;  This feature works best with WordPerfect applications, where upto the whole file can be cut and moved into another application.andM;However, with this feature as with others, the user does not lose a greatdeal of functionality when thirdparty applications are substituted for thoseoffered by WordPerfect.andP;  With non-WordPerfect applications, cutting to diebuffer is limited to the current screen.andP;  Since any information put into thebuffer can either replace or be appended to the existing information, theuser can do multipage cuts by repeated cuts and adds-not as smooth as withthe WordPerfect applications, but certainly serviceable.andM;Electronic Mail.andP;  WordPerfect Office provides a fully functional, easy-to-useelectronic mail package.andP;  The program uses an In Box, Out Box metaphor.andP;  Itprovides the user with the ability to see a directory of other users and anexisting list of groups (distribution lists) to whom mail can be sent.andP;  Theuser can also create private distribution lists on the fly.andM;Once a message has been sent, the sender can get information as to whether ithas been read by the addressee and whether the addressee has deleted it.andP;  Aspecific telephone message form is also available.andM;The electronic mail package does have several limitations, both internallyand in dealing with the outside world.andP;  First, when the package is running onLANs other than Novell, notification of new mail occurs only within the mailfunction itself.andP;  This ability can be extended for those users who are onother full NETBIOS LANs by running a small terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)program.andP;  The use of the TSR, while straightforward is poorly documented.andM;Second, the mail system does not provide any filing paradigm other thansaving messages into DOS files.andP;  There is no way to save mail by keyword orproject, nor to associate a number of messages together into a&quot;conversation.&quot; These facilities are available in such programs as Higginsand the Coordinator.andM;Significant limitations also exist in the electronic mail program's lack ofability to communicate with the outside world.andP;  In this case, there are twoflavors of outside world.andP;  First, the mail system is currently limited to asingle server.andP;  This means that there is no facility for wide areacommunication among PC LANs running WordPerfect Office, much less amongWordPerfect Office implementations running on different platforms.andM;Second, though users can access other mail systems from the Shell (e.g., 3+Mail if on a 3Com network, PROFS internal emulation, etc.), there is no wayto directly gateway WordPerfect Office mail with any other mail systems.andO;Thus, in a network that already has an E-mail system, adding WordPerfectOffice forces all of the users to either change to its Mail or to continueusing the old system.andP;  No mix-andmatch is possible.andM;WordPerfect Corporation agrees that, ideally, a WordPerfcct Office usershould be able to send and receive messages to any other user, independent ofthe second user's location or mail system.andP;  In fact, this is die prime areaof emphasis in theandM;next update of the product, as we shall see in &quot;Directions&quot; below.andM;Calendar/Scheduler.andP;  The second major component of WordPerfect Officecomprises the personal calendar and scheduling facilities.andP;  Though integratedin concept and in function, they are treated as separate functions availablefrom the Shell.The Calendar is a combination of the personal schedule andto-do list.andP;  The main Calendar screen displays die cuffent month with thecurrent day highlighted and any days which have appointments marked with anasterisk (*).andM;Also on the screen are three windows which coffespond to the three Calendarfunctions: Memo, Appointment, To-Do.andP;  The Memo field is strictly a note fieldinto which information can be entered.andP;  The To-Do list allows prioritizationof items.andP;  Any ToDo that has not been marked as completed on its due date isautomatically moved to the next day's list.andP;  The To-Do list is not integratedwith any of the other functions, such as Appointments, Mail, or Notebook.andM;The Appointment field allows users to enter their meetings and similarcommitments for a given day.andP;  The field displays the meetings, but does notwarn against concurrent or overlapping meetings.andP;  The user can set warningalarms at a given number of minutes before the meeting.andP;  However, the alarmworks only when die user is in the Calendar function unless he or she has runa small TSR before loading the Calendar.andM;A particularly powerful feature of the Calendar is AutoDate, which permitsusers to schedule recurring appointments (or memos or To-Dos).andP;  The uscrenters a form ula-for instance, the second Tuesday of the month except forJuly and August-and what he or she wants to appear on those dates.andP;  This canbe an appointment (or a number of appointments), a memo, or a set of To-Dos.andO;The formula can be quite sophisticated.andP;  The drawback to this power andsophistication is that the user gencrally needs the manual to get the propersyntax.andM;Once in place, the formula can be deleted or modified from the Auto-Datescreen.andP;  Any action of this type is instantly reflected in the user'sCalendar.andP;  (Some other systems have a similar capability, but require thateach scheduled entry be deleted or modified.)andM;From the Calendar application, the user can have access to other users'Calendars (given proper permissions).andP;  This allows a secretary or anassistant to keep an executive's schedule and permits a telephonereceptionist to know a given person's whereabouts.andM;The Scheduler enables a user to see &quot;conflicts,&quot; or times when other users onthe system are busy.andP;  It shows only that the user is busy, however, and doesnot give any details of the appointment or meeting (hence, the usefulness ofan assistant having direct access to the boss's Calendar).andP;  It also gives theavailability of certain resources, such as conference rooms, overheadprojectors, white boards, etc.andM;The user can see this information and act upon it in any desired fashion, orhe or she can have the Scheduler suggest the available times for a meetingwith the designated people and resources.andP;  The meeting originator can thenschedule the meeting at a particular time, with the meeting participantsbeing notified that the meeting has been tentatively scheduled.andP;  Theprospective participants are then sent a message requesting their presence atthe meeting.andP;  The participants can accept the meeting, reject the meeting(with or without an explanation), or delay the decision.andM;While offered as separate tasks off of the Shell, the Calendar and Schedulerare essentially the same application.andP;  Once an item is entered into theAppointment field, it is automatically reflected in the Scheduler, and once ascheduled item is accepted, it appears on thc user's Calendar.andM;The Scheduler suffers from some of the same limitations as the electronicmail.andP;  It is bound to a single server and does not operate across platforms.andO;For a Scheduler to be effective, all users must be on it.andP;  This is not yetpossible for multiplatform offices with WordPerfect Office, and, as we shallsee below, will not be possible for quite a while.andM;In addition, the integration between Calendar and Scheduler, though tight,could be made better.andP;  For example, a user puts a meeting in his or herCalendar and then wants to invite some colleagues to it.andP;  This cannot be donefrom the Calendar because it is a Scheduler function.andP;  But it is difficult todo from the Scheduler, which already shows the initial user having a conflictat that time.andP;  Another improvement we would like to see is to bring theAuto-Date's recurring information capabilities to the Scheduler, an itemwhich is on WordPerfect Corporation's plate.andM;Finally, the Scheduler can suffer from poor performance and outright bugs, acondition that should be remedied with the next release.andM;The best thing about the Scheduler is that, once the bugs are out and it ismoved across servers and onto the other platforms, it has a good chance towork.andP;  The success of this type of product depends on everyone using thepersonal Calendar.andP;  If this proves to be too difficult or disruptive, it willnot be done and all the organization's good intentions will wither on thevine.andP;  If, however, the Calendar is easy to use and does not interrupt theusers' normal workflow, and particularly if users feel that it enhances theirpersonal productivity, it has a chance to catch on.andM;Other Modules.andP;  The other modules are fairly standard fair, including aNotebook which enables users to create their own flat files--e.g., phonelists; a multifunctioned Calculator; and a DOS File Manager.andP;  There are alsopowerful program and macro editors that can be quite useful to power users.andM;DIRECTIONS.andP;  The first priority for the developers of WordPerfect Office isto remedy the single-server limitation of die electronic mail and schedulingmodules.andP;  The next major DOS release (2.1), scheduled for the third quarterof 1989, will implement a mail server that will connect to oflier PC LANbasedWordPerfect Office mail servers.andP;  In addition, Mail 2.1 will enable multihostcommunication among WordPerfect Mail users on all platforms upon whichRelease 2.1 has been installed.andM;The new mail release will also support remote users, though this capabilitywill be initially limited to mail communications only.andP;  No provision will bemade for remote users of for users who happen to be traveling to access theircalendars or the group scheduler, although a user could use a program such asCarbon Copy or Close-Up to remotely access more of the WordPerfect Officefunctionality.andM;Other enhancements planned for the third-quarter release of Mail include: CC(carbon copy) and BC (blind copy), user encryption of messages with passwordaccess, and mail priorities.andM;As with the Mail, thc first priority for the Scheduler is to support users onmultiple hosts.andP;  This will be implemented in Release 2.1.andP;  However, it willbe limited to DOS LANs, since, as we shall see below, WordPerfect Corporationhas not yet publicized its release dates for the Scheduler on any otherplatform.andM;The next DOS release will also include other improvements, including theability to directly execute a program or macro from the File Manager, themerger of the Program and Macro Editors, and the encryption of Calendars.andM;COMPETITION.andP;  In one sense, WordPerfect Office for PC LANs has manycompetitors.andP;  In another sense, it has none.andP;  While there are many productsthat have some of the functionality (and, in some cases, stronger individualpieces), in none of the current set of products has any developer been ableto overcome the DOS limitations as well as the WordPerfect developers have.andO;Specifically, none can match the WordPerfect Office Shell in terms ofextensibility and the ability to easily move in and out of the Officeservices, core applications, and added third-party applications.andM;In addition, WordPerfect Office has the advantage of die large numbers ofusers who are familiar with the WordPerfect interface and who make a readilyavailable installed based into which die product can be introduced.andM;Finally, the multiplatform nature of WordPerfect Office and WordPerfectCorporation's plans for the product provide a great advantage over itssingle-platform, DOS -based competition.andM;This is not to say that WordPerfect Office will automatically dominate the PCLAN Office market.andP;  Other companies are aware of the directions that theywill have to take to be competitive-witness the acquisition of Higgins byEnable Software (see last monOi's &quot;News and Analysis&quot;), while Ashton-Tate hasadded electronic mail to its integrated spreadsheet, database, wordprocessing, and communications modules in FrameWork III.andP;  At the same time,other companies seem to be positioning themselves to enter the arena: forexample, Oracle Corporation has added electronic mail to its databaseofferings, and Microsoft seems poised to offer Office functionality on top ofthe soon-tobe released SQL Server and Microsoft's recently acquired Mailprogram.andP;  And this is not to mention IBM and die traditional mini-based IOSproviders, who certainly will not long ignore the PC LAN opportunity.andM;A WordPerfect Office for PC LANs Test DriveandM;Car analogies have become very popular in the computer industry-the dashboardrepresenting the user interface and other parallels.andP;  Here's another: Usingmost of the previous LANbased office products is like moving from anautomatic transmission to a standard shift.andP;  It's a whole different way ofdriving.andP;  For an expert, or for one who is concentrating on driving the car,this can be used to advantage.andP;  But fro most of us, who use a car simply as avehicle to get where we need to go, extra work such as shifting only gets inthe way, particularly in heavy traffic-a phrase which aptly describes most ofour busy days.andP;  Of course, those who learn on standard shifts find them mucheasier to use than do those who have to move to them from the automaticenvironment.andP;  With office software, the problem is not so much in the initialTeaming as it is in the move to a new environment.andM;With this in mind, we took WordPerfect Office out for a short spin and foundthat it is very easy to drive.andP;  The interface, though generallyWordPerfect-like (i.e., requiring a template), added some very usefulon-screen prompts and menu options.andM;The Shell allowed us to stay in our application environment and still havequick access to the office services and other applications.andO;Context-switching was easily accomplished via user-defined macros (requiringthe manual to implement correctly) and swapping the current application toexpanded memory or disk.andP;  Going from a word processing application to see ifa particular time was available for a meeting occurred at about the samespeed as finding the date on the DayTimer on the desk.andP;  Cutting and pastingbetween applications was straightforward.andM;The individual services were easy to learn and worked as advertised (with theexception of Scheduler, which still exhibits some bugginess).andP;  The personalCalendar and its AutoDate feature were particularly impressive.andM;This is not to say that we would not like to see some items tuned up or somedesign changes.andP;  For example, there is certainly room for more integrationbetween the Calendar and Scheduler (planned for a future release), and wewould definitely like to see windowing and mouse support.andM;What we are saying is WordPerfect Office, of any PC LAN product, has done thebest job yet of not interfering with the way people work.andM;Digital and Data GeneralandM;In addition to the PC LAN platform, WordPerfect Office has also been releasedfor Digital and Data General machines running VMS and AOS/VS respectively.andO;These platforms have already been very successful for the WordPerfect wordprocessor, and the company would like to extend this success to the officeautomation market.andM;FEATURES.andP;  While not encompassing the complete functionality of the DOSproduct, the host-based versions on Digital and DG do contain most of the keyelements including the Shell, Electronic Mail, and Calendar.andP;  The host-basedShell is virtually identical to the DOS product, facilitating the movement ofusers from one environment to another.andM;Notably absent from the cuffent release is the group Scheduler.andP;  (There is,in fact, a Scheduler available on the DG platform as part of the originalWordPerfcct Library.andP;  However, this Scheduler does not integrate with theuser's WordPerfect Office Calendar, nor willit be compatible with the futurerelease of a Scheduler as part of WordPerfect Office.) This is a seriousdeficiency which has resulted from the company's commitment to get the nextversion of the Scheduler out for the DOS platform before beginning toimplement it for the other environments.andP;  One reason that the company hasopted against parallel development is to assure the interoperability of theScheduler across platforms once it is available on all of them.andM;Current mail implementation on Digital and DG make use of the host Network(DECnet and Xodiac, respectively) for hostto-host communications within thesingle-vendor environment.andM;DIRECTIONS.andP;  WordPerfect Corporation plans to release the next versions ofboth the Digital and DG offerings by the end of the second half of 1989.andO;Keeping the emphasis on interplatform mail communications, both upgrades willsupport multihost electronic mail delivery on both the same and differentplatforms.andP;  The VMS product will provide a further level of mailinterconnection by providing interfaces to VMS Mail, All-In-1 Mail, andDigital's Message Router, the last providing access to most other public andprivate mail systems.andM;Both host-based products will also be upgraded to functionality similar tothe DOS product by the addition of a Calculator, File Manager, and Notebook,and Program and Macro Editors.andP;  The group Scheduler is planned for this VAXrelease.andM;One direction that WordPerfect Corporation is examining is how to closelyintegrate WordPerfect Office with each vendor's own integrated officeproducts-All-In-1 and CEO.andP;  The company has, thus far, been able to fullyintegrate its word processor with All-In-1 and, to a lesser extent, with CEO.andO;(WordPerfect can not only be used as the All-In-I user's default wordprocessing program but also, for example, as the default Mail editor.andP;  WithCEO, WordPerfect can be selected for word processing functions only.) Thenext logical step would be to allow the user to select WordPerfect Mail asthe default mail system within AllIn-1 or CEO, followed, perhaps, by the samecapability for the Calendar and Scheduler when they are released.andM;On the Digital side, WordPerfect's developers are looking at the possibilityof supporting DECwindows, though no commitment has yet been announced.andO;Future support for Digital's CDA (Compound Document Architecture) is evenhazier, with WordPerfect Corporation committed to supporting and extendingdie multiple data-type capabilities of WordPerfect 5.0.andM;COMPETITION.andP;  WordPerfect Office faces a much different situation as it triesto compete with the already established hostbased systems-a problem that willextend to the Unix environment when the company releases its Unix product.andO;Aside from already having a large installed based of users and being sold bythe same channels as those selling die platforms and specific applicationsfor which the hardware is purchased, AllIn-1 and CEO are more powerful andbetter integrated than is WordPerfect Office.andM;In terms of power, both systems have a fuller set of applications andservices, particularly when we consider WordPerfect Office's lack of aScheduler for the foreseeable future.andP;  In terms of integration, WordPerfectOffice's context-switching and cut-and-paste capabilities are greatadvantages on the DOS platform, but they are commonplace in traditionalhost-based systems.andP;  In fact, as noted above, these systems are at least aswell integrated with the WordPerfect word processor as is WordPerfect Office,to say nothing of their IOS environments, which allow movement of databetween modules, alerts and alarms in any module, and a common interfaceamong a suite of core applications and office services,andM;The Opportunity of Multiplatform Integration.andP;  WordPerfectandM;Office does have one thing going for it as it tries to do battle with thesegiants on their home turf.andP;  By running on all of these platforms and, moreimportantly, by promising interoperability between these platforms-and notlimiting this to mail but extending the promise to scheduling and eventuallyfile management (another future direction for the product)--WordPerfectOffice may become the answer to the platform integration needs of a lot ofcompanies.andM;Another word of caution: Digital and DG are not standing still.andP;  Both haveenunciated more distributed strategies for integrated office systems.andP;  Whilethese are not yet out on multiple platforms, this is certainly a direction inwhich these companies will head.andM;UnixandM;WordPerfect Corporation is one of the few vendors who have released Unixversions their popular DOS products.andP;  WordPerfect is available for Unix onthe Intel 386, Motorola 68OX0, and ATandamp;T 3B Series.andP;  The first Unix release ofWordPerfect Office is scheduled for the second quarter of 1989.andP;  The releasewill initially be for 68OX0 and Xenix 386 (to be followed by a merged 386version).andP;  Currently, Beta versions are being tested on AIX (on RTs), SPARC(Sun4), and Hewlett-Packard machines (where an X-Window version is beingdeveloped).andP;  With regard to other RISC architectures, WordPerfect Corporationhas also signed a letter of intent to join the 88K Consortium, though it hasmade no commitment to MIPS support yet.andM;The company has not yet made a specific commitment to a windowing interfaceeither, though the developers have said that it is likely that WordPerfectOffice will eventually be written for Open Look, Motif, and NextStep.andM;FEATURES.andP;  The first Unix version will contain a full set of features similarto the DOS product, with the notable exception of the Scheduler.andP;  These willinclude:andM;* ShellandM;* MailandM;* CalendarandM;* CalculatorandM;* File ManagerandM;* NotebookandM;* Macro and Program EditorsandM;The mail will not, in this release, it multiple platform connectivity, thoughit will support Unix Host-to-Host communications over TCP/ IP.andP;  In addition,interfaces to UUCP and Usenet will be implemented.andM;COMPETITION.andP;  As in the Digital and Data General environments, WordPerfectOffice for Unix is entering an already mature marketplace, with theadditional factor of the current strong level of competition among Unixoffice system vendors-Uniplex, Quadratron, Applix, etc.-for this market.andP;  Indirect, feature-for-feature comparisons with these systems, WordPerfectOffice will tend, as in the Digital and DG arenas, to come in second.andP;  Inaddition, a number of the major players-Hewlett-Packard and Data General, forexample-are moving towards implementing die functionality of theirproprietary systems on their Unix platforms.andM;WordPerfect Corporation is aware that it will be a while before its Officeproduct will be able to directly compete with these vendors on their ownplatforms, Rather, the Unix product (as well as the VMS and AOS/VS versions)is initially aimed at mixed environments, where the ability for the user toeasily move from one environment to another and the eventual crossplatformcommunications between the Mails and Schedulers will be more important thanfuncdon-by-function checklists.andM;MacintoshandM;The initial release of WordPerfect Office for the Macintosh is planned forthe third quarter of 1989.andP;  It will be markedly different from the otherversions in that it will not make use of the Shell concept.andP;  Rather, it willrely on the Mac's iconic interface to provide users with easy access to itsfeatures.andM;FEATURES.andP;  PordPerfect Corporation expects the third-quarter release tocontain:andM;* MailandM;* CalendarandM;* NotebookandM;* File ManagerandM;The Mail will be Version 2.1, which will support host-tohost orserver-to-server communications among WordPerfect Mad systems.andP;  The mail willalso have several enhancements over the DOS version, particularly in theareas in which die Mac excels: graphics and font control.andP;  Mac-to-Mac users,at least, will be able to embed graphics and have access to full selection offonts to use in their messages.andM;One question not yet answered by WordPerfect's Macintosh developers isexactly how the Office services will be accessed.andP;  Will they be reached asdesk accessories or as individual applications (running simultaneously underMultiFinder)? Each approach has pros and cons, and it will be interesting tosee which is chosen for WordPerfect Office functions.andM;COMPETITION.andP;  Of all of the platforms, the Macintosh has been die slowest toget strong group-oriented tools.andP;  Even the basic areas assumed as the minimumstandard for the PC LAN-transparent file-sharing (theoretically available,but greatly limited due to the speed of LocalTalk), centralized backup,gateway communicafions, and functional electronic mail--are just now beingachieved in many Mac networks.andP;  And in the area of group productivityproducts, the Mac platform is seriously behind.andM;Some of this may be due to the individualism of many early Mac users, thestereotypical mavericks who do not want to have anything to do with anyoneelse.andP;  Some of it may be due to the difficulty of porting these applicationsfrom the PC world to the Mac; none of the early PC group productivity vendorshas yet been able to do so.andP;  Whatever the reason, this is a wide open areafor anyone who can get in with the functionality of an integrated officesystem on the Mac.andM;WordPerfect Office is well positioned to be an early, if not thefirst,entrant.andP;  It will also be able to leverage its multiplatform communicationsplans to strong advantage, particularly in the mixed Mac/PC environment.andM;OS/2andM;WordPerfect Corporation has not yet publicized specific plans for release ofan OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM) version of its Office product.andP;  Currently,the company's emphasis is on moving WordPerfect to PM, with Office followingclosely behind, but it is unlikely that we will see either product this year.andO;Interestingly, the moves of WordPerfect Office to the graphics environmentsof Macintosh, PM, and X-Window are being handled completely independently ofeach other.andM;WordPerfect Office will run in the OS/2 DOS compatibility box; however, thereare some problems with alerts and notifications.andM;The Future of WordPerfect OfficeandM;The series of releases scheduled for this year will by no means be the end ofthe development of WordPerfect Office.andP;  WordPerfect Corporation is looking attwo specific directions in which it will concentrate its efforts at enhancingthe product, The first is in the area of distributed services--Calendaring,Scheduling, and Document Management.andP;  The company envisions services similarto the mail servers, which allow host-to-host and serverto-server mailexchange (to be introduced in the next releasesee above).andP;  These servers willhandle the calendar/scheduling functions and document management, providingmultihost scheduling of people, resources, and calendar events, and enablingthe corporate-wide indexing, archival, and retrieval of documents and files.andM;The second area of focus will be to enable WordPerfect Office electronic mailto communicate with other office and mail systems.andP;  WordPerfect Corporationplans to write its own interfaces to the appropriate external gateways.andO;These will be implemen ted in phases over the last part of 1989 and during1990.andP;  The first phase will be to encapsulate the mail messages with headerand packet information so that they can be sent over wide area networks(X.25) connecting WordPerfect Mail servers.andP;  The second phase will see aseries of translations to MHS, X.400, and/or other internal message formatsof other mail systems.andP;  Ultimately, the goal is for WordPerfect Office usersto be able to transparently send and receive messages ftom PROFS, DEC Mail,Unix Mail, MCI Mail, Telex, Fax, etc.andM;The Opportunity: WordPerfect Office as a Point of Cross-Platform IntegrationandM;The original goal of WordPerfect Office was to bring office functionality,particularly mail and calendar/scheduling, to the platforms upon whichWordPerfect was already having significant success.andP;  The company quicklyfound that its customers were demanding that these platforms be able to speakto each other, and they meant a lot more than mere file exchange.andP;  Customersmade it very clear that they want nothing less than interoperability amongthe mail, scheduling, file management, and core applications on all of theirplatforms.andM;This, of course, is what customers have been demanding from their vendors fora number of years.andP;  Suddenly, and quite surprisingly to the company itself,WordPerfect Corporation has been placed by some of these customers in theposition of being the solution to all of their problems.andM;Well, it is clear that the product (and the company) is not quite ready toassume that role.andP;  However, if, over the next year, the pieces fall intoplace just right, and if WordPerfect Office is perceived as a major componentof multiplatform integration, then the product might just take off and neverhave to look back.andP;  Issues Facing WordPerfect OfficeandM;In order for WordPerfect Office to achieve the role of a leading officesystem and a point of integration among dissimilar systems, the company mustsuccessfully address a number of issues in both the near and longer terms.andO;The key issues facing WordPerfect Corporation include the speed with which itcan get out the enhancements to the product, the implementation of agraphical user interface, and the migration of the current product to thenext-generation architecture.andM;SPEED OF IMPLEMENTATION.andP;  WordPerfect Office has a window in both the PC LANand Macintosh office arenas, as well as in the area of multiplatformintegration.andP;  WordPerfect Corporation must move quickly before the window isclosed by another company with a successful multiplatform IOS or before thewindow becomes too crowded and confusing for the customer to make a clearchoice.andM;In order to do this, the company must be able to deliver die latestfunctionality on all platforms very soon after it is available on any ofthem.andP;  Dis is particularly true of those functions which will integrateactivities on multiple platforms, such as mail, scheduling, and documentmanagement.andM;It is also important that WordPerfect Corporation's ability to provide mailgateways to key mail systems comes sooner rather than later.andP;  Certainlyconnectivity to outside mail systems is important.andP;  However, equallyimportant is the ability to seamlessly integrate a new mail system to thenative system already being employed.andM;Just as the WordPerfect Office user is given a choice of word processors andspreadsheets, he or she should also be able to choose (in many cases, toretain the current favorite) the electronic mail interface of choice.andP;  Thus,on a network that currently has an MHS or 3Com mail system, WordPerfectOffice should be able to be implemented so that those users who wish to keepthe existing mail system will be able to transparently communicate with thosewho opt for WordPerfect Mail.andP;  This approach, currently being taken on dieDigital platform, should be quickly extended to the other environments.andM;GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE.andP;  In today's world, it's essential for softwarevendors to have a graphical user interface (GUI) or to have a strongcommitment to implementing one, At the very least, users arc looking for somekind of windowing and mouse support.andP;  None of the current versions ofWordPerfect Corporation's products (other than on the Macintosh) sport a GUI.andM;WordPerfect Corporation made a decision carly on to wait for OS/2Presentation Manager to be available and in widespread use before releasing aGUI-based product for PCs.andP;  At the same time, the company released theMacintosh version of WordPerfect with a Mac -like user interface (though notMac-like enough for some), and is working on simplifying and improving it forthe next release (as well as adding increased &quot;5.0-like&quot; functionality).andO;WordPerfect Corporation's Unix developers are also working on X-Windowversions of the product line.andM;Currently, there are three separate development groups within the companyworking on their own GUIs: PM, Mac, and the various versions of X-Window.andP;  Inthe short run, this seems inefficient, and may increase time to market forthe various graphical products (many of the windowing and interfaceprinciples should be shareable among the various developers).andM;More significantly, in the long run, the lack of a crossapplication userinterface development effort could put WordPerfect at a severe disadvantagevs.andP;  companies such as IBM, Digital, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard, who willbe basing their next generation of office products on their own common,consistent GUI implementation, be it PM under SAA, DECwindows, MS Windows andPM, or MS Windows and PM on top of NewWave or Motif, respectively.andP;  Thesecompanies will be stressing their interface &quot;advantage&quot; when competing witheach other, and will certainly emphasize it against any competitor who cannotproduce a similar environment.andM;There is a further question of whetlier a DOS -based GUI is necessary.andO;Certainly, MS Windows has taken a long time to get off the ground, and it hastaken even longer for many major Windows applications to appear.andP;  And for acompany such as WordPerfect Corporation to rewrite its flagship wordprocessing product for a windowing environment may be rather risky.andP;  However,WordPerfect Office, specifically its Shell, may be a particularly good placefor the company to experiment with offering both a character and a graphicinterface, and then move the interfaces of individual functions andapplications a little more slowly.andM;ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES.andP;  WordPerfect Office's greatest strength is that it hasextended the DOS platform to a degree where it simultaneously supportsIOS-like functionality and PC flexibility.andP;  By extending the product acrossmost of the popular platforms, the company has created a major contender inthe emerging integrated office environment.andP;  The issue that WordPerfectCorporation's developers now face is whether the current architecture cancarry it into the next-generation environment of DNC (distributed networkcomputing).andM;The company is taking a number of large steps in that direction by separatingthe client and server functions in Mail, eventually separating them inScheduling and Document Management, and by providing cross-platformfunctionality in these areas.andP;  In addition, the extensibility of the Officeand the ability to add new services and functions as needed (or as developed)is in keeping with the spirit of the distributed office.andM;There is, however, an additional step that WordPerfect Office will eventuallyhave to take: re-designing the Office products to sit upon and make integraluse of a relational database.andP;  The robustness, extensibility, and flexibilityof adding functionality by creating new relationships provided by theunderlying database will make it a key component of the next generation ofoffice systems.andM;WordPerfect Corporation developers are aware of the power of building a suiteof office services upon a relational database.andP;  They envision an architecturebuilt around common data which can be used by the applications and services:mail, calendar/scheduling, document management (including text and images),communications, spell-checking, etc.andP;  The question that they will have toanswer over the next months is how to migrate the cuffent architecture (basedon a file comparison and exchange paradigm) to the database-based vision.andM;This question itself raises a couple of issues: Should the database beindustry standard (SQL-based)? And should WordPerfect Corporation develop thedatabase itself, or should it be developed in partnership will one of thecompanies specializing in relational databases?andM;From our view, the answer to the industry-standard database question isself-evident.andP;  In order to be able to interoperate with other databases andother front ends which use SQL, a standard SQL database must be developed.andO;As to whether this should be home-grown or acquired, we are of two minds.andM;In general, success in the industry is currently and will continue to bemarked by successful relationships among different companies, each bringingspecific strengths to the party.andP;  Thus, we would recommend that WordPerfectCorporation enter in partnership on this major development step.andP;  However,WordPerfect Corporation is not yourordinary company.andP;  It is a strongcorporate culture leaning towards nonentanglement and self-reliance, with astron sense of &quot;we can do it best ourselves.&quot; And maybe the company can.andP;  Ithas certainly done well thus far pursuing this course.andM;In any event, the architectural migration question will be the most crucialone that WordPerfect Office will have to face over the next years.andM;Conclusion: Reaching the Integrated OfficeandM;Prediction: By 1995, the distinction between LANs and hostbased systems willhave virtually disappeared.andP;  The norm will be for whole organizations to benetworked in a distributed network computing environment based on theclient-server model.andP;  What we know today as hosts (including mainframes) willevolve to being general (file, print, communications, etc.) or morespecialized (database, image, project management, etc.) servers.andM;This will not simply be an architectural evolution.andP;  Our favorite PCapplications and applications environments on hosts and PCs will also cometogether.andP;  (This is already happening.andP;  It is quite possible for an All-In-1user to choose WordPerfect as his or her editor.) By 1995, and maybe sooner,there will be a complete blurring of any lines between PC-networkedapplications and the traditional host-based integrated office system.andM;Certainly, the traditional system vendors have set their sights uponcontrolling this environment, from the networking to the applications layers.andO;And the major vendors-IBM, Digital, Hewlett-Packard, Data General, Wang-areevolving their office products to meet the needs of the new environment.andM;However, we do not see the traditional systems world moving down and gobblingup the PC-oriented world.andP;  More likely, the PC world will grow up and meetthe old host-based world halfway, providing a partnership in which adistributed networking computing environment will be reached.andM;From the PC LAN side, we are beginning to see indications of how theevolution towards die integrated office will take place.andP;  One key clement isthe introduction of the concept of the LAN Office, talked about for a whileand now emerging as a force in itself.andP;  It is by pushing the LAN Office, botharchitecturally and conceptually, to meet and embrace the enterprise's needsthat companies such as WordPerfect Corporation can play a crucial role.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
