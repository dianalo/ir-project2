It accused the United States of seeking to overthrow China'sgovernment and turn the country capitalist, saying Washington hadhelped foment unrest.   The House of Representatives voted June 29 to suspend trade anddevelopment programs with China, prohibit the sale of policeequipment and suspend transfers of nuclear technology.   ``To those people in the American Congress who deliberatelydistort the facts and interfere with China's internal affairs, wecannot but express our indignation,'' said the Communist Partynewspaper, the People's Daily.   Congress' move followed broader sanctions halting military salesand suspending high-level exchanges imposed by President Bush in thewake of the bloody military suppression of China's pro-democracymovement.   Troops backed by tanks cleared central Beijing of protesters onJune 4, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.   ``Any sovereign country would use the same legal and reasonablemethods when faced with a situation of this magnitude,'' thePeople's Daily said.   ``But some anti-China and anti-socialist congressmen in theUnited States refuse to accept the truth. They use their classinstinct of anti-communism to interfere in China's internal affairs...   ``They never talk about the suppression of the black human rightsmovement or student protests against the Vietnam War in theircountry, but sanctimoniously claim to be the guardians of `humanrights.'''   China's Communist leaders have kept up a barrage of anti-U.S.criticism in an attempt to discredit U.S. news reports about theirsuppression of dissent.   The Liberation Daily, Shanghai's Communist Party paper, saidorganizers of student protests in the United States must givedetailed personal information and that permission to demonstrate canbe rescinded at any time.   It listed student protest incidents in the United States from the1950s to 1970s, including the killing by National Guardsmen of fourpeople during an anti-Vietnam War protest at Kent State Universityin Ohio in 1970.   Zhao Ziyang, ousted as Communist Party leader for opposing theuse of troops to crush the pro-democracy movement, was hit with morebroadsides.   A lawmaker charged him with neglecting the leadership of theworking class.   ``The People's Republic of China is a Communist country that usesthe coalition of the workers and the farmers as a foundation fordemocratic dictatorship,'' Wang Houde told the National People'sCongress, whose steering committee ends a session today.   ``But for a certain period we have been negligent in thisrespect, and Comrade Zhao Ziyang's behavior is closely linked tothis,'' Wang said. ``Comrade Zhao Ziyang did not manage wellrelations between workers.''   Zhao has been stripped of his party and government posts, butcontinuing references to him in the press as ``comrade'' indicate heretains party membership.   The newspaper Economic Reference charged that Washington isseeking to overthrow China's government by turning the countrycapitalist, guiding and supporting forces seeking revoltionarychange, stirring up protests among minority ethnic populations,spreading anti-communist propaganda and cultivating dissidents underthe banner of human rights.   Its Wednesday editions said the U.S. government-run Voice ofAmerica, ``clearly reflecting the American government's policy,started the most disgusting rumors, fanning the flames, and evenacted as a contact between reactionary forces in China and theUnited States.''   ``The truth already has been exposed: American influence wasbehind the supporters of the few people who created this turmoil inBeijing that turned into a counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' it said.   VOA has an estimated listening audience in China of tens ofmillions and official media have repeatedly singled it out forcriticism.   The government last month expelled a VOA correspondent, accusinghim of spreading false reports and violating martial law.   In spite of the anti-American diatribe, China continues to tryand lure back foreign businessmen who fled the country after thecrackdown and assure potential foreign investors that the countryhas returned to stability.   Deng Yingchao, head of the Chinese People's Association forFriendship with Foreign Countries and as widow of former PremierChou En-lai a prominent spokesperson for China's internationalpolicy, told a Japanese lawmaker today that China's open-door andeconomic reform policies would not change.</TEXT></DOC>
