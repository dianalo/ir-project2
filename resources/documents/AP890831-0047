In October testimony, the official, Deborah Gore Dean, suggestedWhite House aides may have promoted the use of multimillion-dollargrants for politically attractive projects of the Department ofHousing and Urban Development, the Times said.   The Times said the testimony offers a clear indication of WhiteHouse ties to HUD's grant-selection process and apparently opens newavenues of inquiry for investigators in HUD and Congress who areexamining other programs for possible abuse.   Dean implied, and former White House officials interviewed thisweek agreed, that the contacts were proper, and prosecutors who havereviewed Dean's actions have not alleged any wrongdoing, the Timessaid.   Dean, executive assistant to former Housing Secretary Samuel R.Pierce Jr. from 1984-87, has refused to testify before Congress,citing the Fifth Amendment. The appearance before the grand jury,sitting in Jackson, Miss., was several months before Dean became acentral figure in allegations of influence peddling and politicalfavoritism at HUD.   The Times obtained a transcript of the grand jury testimony.   A lawyer for Dean, Joseph E. diGenova, told the Times herstatements and other recently disclosed evidence ``establish beyonddoubt that Miss Dean was not an independent operator, but rather wasacting under direction and with authorization.''   Two officials in the Reagan White House told the Times they hadasked HUD to give close attention to specific grant applicants butsaid the contacts were routine and that the White House neverordered HUD to finance the projects.   According to the transcript, Dean said politics was discussed inawarding money under the Urban Development Action Grants program,that lawmakers often contacted her to promote projects for theprogram and that the White House intervened in at least one-quarterof the successful grant applicants.   The grand jury was investigating allegations of local corruptioninvolving HUD money and a hotel project in Biloxi.   Dean acknowledged in her testimony that a grant awarded to Biloxiin 1987 probably would not have been approved without a White Houserequest that it be given special attention.   ``Before, you could pretty much have guessed Biloxi, Miss., wouldnot get a UDAG,'' she said.   The grand jury investigation led to the indictment of a formerBiloxi mayor, Gerald Blessey, on charges he conspired to divert$160,000 of the HUD grant. The mayor is now on trial in federalcourt in Biloxi.</TEXT></DOC>
