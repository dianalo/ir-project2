The move is intended to help NEC break into markets thathave been tough for it to crack. While its supercomputerssell well in Japan, NEC has sold just one of itssupercomputers in the U.S., where Cray Research Corp.dominates the market.</LP><TEXT>   The companies also said they will explore jointlydeveloping and marketing workstations and file servers basedon the Unix operating system for sale in both the U.S. andJapan.   Control Data, a computer services concern, said it willmarket NEC's SX-3 supercomputers primarily to the automotiveand aerospace industries, though it also hopes to break intothe civilian government business, which traditionally hasbeen sensitive about purchasing a Japanese-made computer.But, said James E. Ousley, president of the computer productsgroup, &quot;sooner or later, they're going to have to takeadvantage of technology from other places in the world.&quot;   Control Data will provide support for the machines, whichstart at $5 million each. The typical system costs $15million to $25 million.   Control Data said the NEC agreement won't affect itsmarketing agreements with Cray and Convex Computer Corp., amaker of smaller supercomputers. Mr. Ousley said Control Dataincludes Cray and Convex machines as part of its bids fortotal computer systems and adding NEC to the line would&quot;allow us to be more competitive.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
