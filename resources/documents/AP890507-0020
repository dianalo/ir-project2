More than 300 Turkish and Kurdish refugees held their owndemonstration and marched to the Turkish Embassy where they burnedthat country's flag.   They were protesting the death of an 18-year-old worker duringviolent unauthorized May Day demonstrations in Istanbul last week.   More than 100 riot police prevented the demonstrators, whochanted ``Death to the fascist Turkish regime!'' from approachingthe embassy.   There are about 700 Turkish and Kurdish political refugeesliving in Athens. The Kurds belong to an outlawed movement thatseeks the formation of an independent Kurdish state in southeasternTurkey.   The May Day celebration, organized by the General Confederationof Greek Workers, was the first unified workers' gathering in morethan four years.   ``On a day like this our various views, ideological differencesand political choices are put aside under the joint goal thatbrings workers together,'' said Lambros Kanellopoulos, the group'sSocialist president.   The confederation, which represents most of Greece's 3.5 millionworkers, was bitterly divided after its pro-government socialistleadership pushed for support of an austerity policy in 1985.   Support for the two-year austerity policy, imposed by thegoverning Panhellenic Socialist Movement, was opposed by radicalsocialist and communist labor leaders who split the confederation.But working under a new, more moderate leadership, thosedifferences have since been resolved.   The confederation issued a resolution Sunday calling on thegovernment for wage increases linked to the inflation rate and areduction of the workweek from 37.5 hours to 35. Inflation inGreece was running at 14 percent at the end of 1988, the highest inthe 12-nation European Economic Community.</TEXT></DOC>
