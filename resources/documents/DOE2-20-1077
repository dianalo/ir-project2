This paper reports on both the research being conducted by theHawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University of Hawaii, and theprogress by commercial wind farms. One objective of HNEI's wind programis to maximize cost-effective utilization of wind energy. Another objectiveis to assist wind farms and utilities in providing and maintaining qualitypower to customers. Hawaii's great wind energy potential offers one ofthe best opportunities in the near future to displace imported oil andeventually provide Hawaii with a greater degree of energy security, aswell as a better environment. HNEI's major research work has been addressingthe problem of wind energy utility interface. This work, coupled withthe energy storage program, is based at the Kahua Wind Energy StorageTest facility on the island of Hawaii. Additional programs getting underwayat the facility are design of a pumped-storage hydroelectric system,wind forecasting, and hybrid energy systems. In the commercial sector,the world's largest horizontal axis wind turbine generator, the MOD-5B,has been put on-line at Kahuku, Oahu; and the first wind farm outsideof Japan consisting of Japanese manufactured wind turbines (37 Mitsubishi250 kW), Kamao'a Wind Farm, has been put on-line at South Point, Hawaii.</TEXT></DOC>
