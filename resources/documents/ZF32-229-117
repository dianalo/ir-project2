Hemoved to another movie studio, which gave him more money to make more movies.andO;He's made four films since Heaven's Gate--all of which have flopped.andP;  Andhe's already at work on yet another project.andM;Which brings me to a person you've heard of--Ed Esber.andP;  In some ways Ed is adim memory now.andP;  The controversy that surrounded his tenure at (and departurefrom) Ashton-Tate is receding.andP;  The company's PR machine cranks outstatements about a new commitment to the technology and the user base--akinder, gentler dBASE.andP;  But what do you suppose happened to Ed Esber, the manwho took one of the most profitable and powerful software companies in theworld and brought it to the brink of collapse? He merely moved to anothercompany, Poqet Computers, where he continues his craft as Director of Sales.andM;What does this have to do with the Xbase community? Just this: Perhapsnowhere else but in the software industry and the movie business can peoplewho have failed so mightily and so publicly continue to be rewarded sohandsomely.andM;And thereby hangs, in my opinion, a cautionary tale.andP;  The story of EdwardEsber, Jr.: An Xbase parable for our time.andP;  Pay attention, because you may bethe next victim.andM;For the record, I don't believe that Ed Esber did anything illegal.andP;  But I dobelieve his type represents a dangerous element in the world of technology,an element that puts marketing hype and take-no-prisoners competition aheadof research and development and users.andM;Why is this attitude so dangerous in the Xbase community? Simply becausetechnology--particularly database management technology--is not a commodity.andO;If you're talking about toothpaste or soft drinks, differences betweenproducts are relatively small, and the products themselves don't change muchover time.andP;  So the only way to compete is to out-market or out- hype theother guy.andP;  That's why we have things like  cola wars.' For commodity-typeproducts, this kind of marketing works.andP;  But think about its effects in acommunity like ours, particularly now.andM;The DBASE language, currently in the public domain (as a result of a LosAngeles judge's decision), is an unformed, non-standard language.andP;  It's indanger of being fragmented into oblivion, much like the BASIC language.andP;  Now,more than ever, the language needs to be nurtured.andP;  And the community needsto rally together.andP;  What we don't need are lawsuits or empty marketingpromises designed to generate short-term sales and paralyze competition.andM;Technology, in a very direct way, is the creative expression of one person(or a group of people).andP;  Technology can be mass-produced and mass-marketed,but it is by its very nature a fluid, constantly evolving entity.andP;  Itscontinuing evolution depends heavily on the consistent flow of creativeideas--some developer or development team asking  How can we solve thisproblem?&quot; or &quot;How can we improve on what's already here?' If you stifle theflow of these ideas, you start a chain reaction that can shake the foundationof a even the biggest software corporation.andM;Ed Esber, reflecting the darkest beliefs of the uninvolved executive, statedthat he placed the same value on his development team as he did the guys wholoaded the delivery trucks.andP;  Thus, he killed the creative process atAshton-Tate.andM;How was Ashton-Tate to know? If they'd looked back a few years, they mighthave learned about a company called VisiCorp.andP;  They marketed the firstmicrocomputer spreadsheet, called VisiCalc.andP;  As VisiCalc sales started totake off and VisiCorp became more successful, a change began to take place.andO;Marketing issues began to take precedence over Randamp;D.andP;  A number of lawsuitswere filed.andM;New products were announced, then delayed, or never delivered at all.andP;  Overtime, VisiCorp began to lose market-share to upstart competitors like Lotus.andM;The company eventually went out of business.andP;  And in 1985 VisiCorp's Directorof Marketing, a man who had been an active participant in developing its newpolicies (and in the resulting crash), went out looking for another job as amarketing consultant.andP;  His name was Ed Esber.andP;  Apparently, no one atAshton-Tate checked his references.andM;Which is the point I'm trying to make.andP;  These people are out there.andP;  They'redisguised as normal, intelligent people.andP;  And they want desperately to workfor you.andM;What can you do? For starters, be skeptical.andP;  Take the time to look carefullyat the marketing people you hire.andP;  Be careful of the promises you hear.andP;  Looknot only at resumes, but also at the companies your candidates are comingfrom.andP;  How healthy were those companies when they started? And how about whenthey left? In other words, do your homework.andP;  After all, you're going to givethese people what amounts to the keys to your vault.andP;  Make sure they knowwhat they're doing.andM;You know, the Apaches had a great system for warning people who wanted toattack them.andP;  They would hang the bodies of slain enemy warriors on treesalong the frontier of their territory.andP;  Perhaps we should all hang Ed Esber(in effigy, of course) in front of our respective companies.andP;  It would serveas a constant reminder of just how bad things can get when managers andmarketers put the creative forces that drive our industry under attack.andM;Because, like failed film directors, they keep coming back.andP;  David irwin isthe head of irwin ink, a San Diego, Calif.-based microcomputer marketing andcommunications firm.andP;  He can be contacted at (619) 450-1960.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
