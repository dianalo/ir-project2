Highland Valley Copper, which is 55%-owned by Cominco Ltd. and 45%-owned by Lornex Mining Corp., operates Canada's largest copper mine, in the Highland Valley mining district of British Columbia, 35 miles south of Kamloops. Cominco, Teck and Lornex are all Vancouver-based mining companies.    Highland Valley was formed in 1986 to combine a copper deposit and mill owned by Cominco with a copper deposit and mill owned by Lornex. The new agreement will make use of Highmont Mining's closed mine and mill in the area, and provide Highmont Mining with 5% of Highland Valley Copper's cash flow.    As a result of the change, Cominco's stake in Highland Valley Copper will be cut to 50%. Lornex, which will retain its 45% stake, has agreed to pay $16.7 million to Highland Valley Copper, which in turn will provide the funds to Cominco.    Poul Hansen, president of Highland Valley Copper, said the new agreement &quot;would result in all of the major mining and milling assets in the Highland Valley area being held by the one partnership entity, allowing for optimization in production planning and control of production costs.&quot;    Separately, Teck said its combined equity in Highland Valley Copper will be 20% following completion of the transaction. The total includes 2.5% through Highmont and 17.5% held indirectly through Teck's stockholdings in both Cominco and Lornex. </TEXT></DOC>
