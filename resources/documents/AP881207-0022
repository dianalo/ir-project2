The department's three reactors at the plant near Aiken, S.C.,have been shut down due to safety concerns and maintenance needs.They are the nation's only source for tritium, a radioactive isotopeof hydrogen used in modern nuclear warheads.   Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needsto be regularly replenished.   The report released Tuesday deals with the K reactor at SavannahRiver. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said last week thedepartment hoped to restart the reactor this spring or summer.   But the report outlines more than 160 separate tasks forrestarting the reactor, calling for a complete overhaul of training,safety, management, operating and inspection procedures.   The measures are ``judged to require a longer-term improvementprogram that would take several years,'' it said.   The Pentagon said Tuesday that some weapons in the U.S. nucleararsenal may have to be cannibalized unless at least one of thetritium-producing reactors at Savannah River is restarted by the endof this summer.   ``We're up against the wall if at least one of those reactors isnot started by late this summer,'' said Defense Department spokesmanLt. Col. Richard L. Oborn. He added that ``ultimately you would haveto cannibalize weapons. You have to get tritium somewhere.''   Oborn said the Pentagon had considered other options, such aspurchasing tritium from Britain or France, producing tritium insmall Energy Department reactors or setting a new policy that wouldallow an increase in tritium decay in existing weapons.   But, he said, ``the only viable alternative is to start the(Savannah River) reactors.''   The Washington Post reported today that the Reagan administrationhas rejected an Energy Department appeal for additional money torepair damaged reactors at the Savannah River plant. Citing reportsfrom administration sources, it said the department will divert $200million from other programs to do the repair work.   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said he was planning an inspection trip Dec. 15-16 toSavannah River. ``I'm particularly interested in the tritiumproduction cycle,'' said Spratt, whose committee authorizes fundingfor the Energy Department weapons facilities.   ``I think there's been a significant change of attitudes at DOEand they've put new effort into trying to address the problems theyhave,'' he said.   In another development, the department issued a separate reportproviding a preliminary ranking of 155 environmental problems at 16sites involved with nuclear weapons production.   ``This is an important step in categorizing environmentalproblems in our defense complex,'' Herrington said in releasing thereport. ``It will provide the department with the informationnecessary to allocate funds for environmental clean-up in asystematic and responsible manner.''   The 232-page report lists each environmental problem found,provides a public risk assessment for each and describes whataction, if any, is under way to resolve the problem.   The two most serious problems cited dealt with groundwatercontamination at Rocky Flats outside Denver and the Pantex plantnear Amarillo, Texas. They warranted action by the department beforecompletion of the survey because of the potential threat they posed,the report said.   Twenty-six of the problems ranked fell into a secondary categoryof potentia l public hazards. The majority of those problemsinvolved ``wastewater management and liquid discharges.''</TEXT></DOC>
