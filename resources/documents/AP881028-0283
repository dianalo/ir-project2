Analysts said technical factors continued dominating Thursday'strading session, pushing home heating oil futures sharply higher,boosting crude oil futures and depressing unleaded gasoline futures.   ``I think we're going to continue to see this until somesubstantial action comes out of OPEC,'' said Bob Baker, seniorenergy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was scheduledto meet next month to discuss controlling production as a way ofpropping up worldwide oil prices, which have fallen sharply inrecent weeks.   Iran's oil minister said Thursday that his country would accept afurther fall in oil prices rather than agreeing to an OPECproduction quota equal to Iraq, Iran's foe in the 8-year PersianGulf War.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, gained 27 centsThursday to $13.68 a barrel after rising 15 cents on Wednesday.Other contract months also rose.   Among refined products, the November contract for unleadedgasoline settled at 50.72 cents a gallon, down 0.95 cent. Thecontract had declined slightly on Wednesday.   The November contract for home heating oil, which rose 1.19 centsin the previous session, closed up another 1.49 cents at 43.04 centsa gallon.   Baker said gasoline prices, which had risen recently, were toohigh for this time of year. He said the shift toward heating oilrepresented a ``rapid market correction.''   ``The season puts the demand more focused on the heating oil,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
