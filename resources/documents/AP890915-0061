The findings ``offer hope that similar methodologies might leadto an effective vaccine against AIDS in humans,'' Shiu-Lok Hu,leader of the team that tested the vaccine, said Thursday.   But he cautioned that the monkey virus differs from the humansAIDS virus and that there were no immediate implications for AIDSpatients.   The virus, simian acquired immunodeficiency virus type D, orSAIDS D, is an often-fatal, AIDS-like disease in monkeys, Hu said.   The research team including scientists of the University ofWashington, the National Cancer Institute and Oncogen, a Seattlebiotechnology company, announced their findings at a news conferenceat the university's Health Sciences Center. The results of theiryear-long study will be reported in this month's Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences.   Four vaccinated macaque monkeys exposed to the SAIDS D virus haveremained healthy and free of the virus, while three of fourunvaccinated monkeys in the study developed signs of infectionwithin two weeks after exposure to the virus.   ``We believe this is the first live, recombinant vaccine thatprotects primates against a retrovirus that causes AIDS-likediseases,'' said William Morton, supervisory veterinarian at theUniversity of Washington's Regional Primate Research Center and anauthor of the paper.   The fourth unvaccinated animal did not become infected,consistent with reports showing that for undetermined reasons somemonkeys are resistant to infection, the scientists said.   The genetically constructed vaccine, called ``v-senv5,'' combinespart of the protein coat of the SAIDS D virus with the vacciniavirus, which has been used successfully to eradicate smallpox.   The four vaccinated monkeys received two immunizations 16 weeksapart. Twelve weeks after the second immunizations, all eightanimals in the study, including the four non-vaccinated monkeys,were exposed to the SAIDS D virus.   The four vaccinated animals developed antibodies to the specificproteins used in the vaccine, proving that the monkey's immuneresponse was triggered by the vaccine and not by exposure to theSAIDS D virus itself, the researchers said.   Last month, Harvard University researchers working with monkeysreported they had protected monkeys from a similar simian AIDSvirus. In that study, the monkeys were given a killed-virus vaccinerather than a live, recombinant vaccine, said Hu, director ofvaccine research at Oncogen.   Hu said the live virus vaccine ``elicits an immune response moreclosely akin to that obtained from a natural infection.''   Hu stressed that both approaches were important and could be usedin efforts to develop a vaccine against AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
