KISSEL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An artist Friday offered to change the title ofhis sculpture ``Hunky Steelworker,'' and the festival displaying itagreed, quieting criticism by steelworkers and ethnic groupsoffended by the name.   The 12-foot-tall statue is the most prominently displayedsculpture in the Three Rivers Arts Festival, which opened downtownFriday.   Croatians and other Eastern Europeans in western Pennsylvania'ssteel towns consider the term ``hunky'' a slur.   ``It's not the art, it's just the word `hunky,''' said John P.Plesh, secretary-treasurer of the Croatian Fraternal Union. ``Thestatue is nice.''   The stocky, fiberglass statue erected last month at Point StatePark wears a dour expression and a rust-colored hat, and stands infront of a large fountain. It is to be on display until the festivalends June 17.   The city's controller noticed the title while jogging, and held anews conference next to the statue last week to decry the use ofwhat he considers an ethnic insult.   The artist, Luis Jimenez of Hondo, N.M., said Friday he had hireda fiberglass company to scour the word ``Hunky'' from the base ofthe statue.   The term originated in the late 1800s to describe people ofHungarian descent, but its use was expanded quickly as an insulttoward anyone whose ancestors came from central Europe, said SarahThomason, a professor of linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh.   Many Eastern Europeans emigrated to Pittsburgh around the turn ofthe century to work in the city's dozens of steel mills.   Ms. Thomason said the term is similar in origin as ``honky,''which some blacks have used to describe whites.   Jimenez said no offense was intended.   ``I was trying to pay homage to the men who worked at the steelmills,'' Jimenez said. ```Millhunk' was a term I had come across inmy research at the library.''   Six organizations who protested the title issued a statementthanking Jimenez for changing the title.   ``We thank Luis Jimenez for his sensitive handling of thissituation,'' said mediator Ann Begler, reading a statement from thegroups. ``By offering to cover the word, `Hunky,' he has made hissculpture a real tribute to Steelworkers of all backgrounds in thisregion.''   Jimenez said the decision wasn't difficult after realizing themagnitude of the flap.   ``There is a portion of the community who was upset and there aresome wounds there,'' Jimenez said. Titles of sculptures are meantonly as a guide to the work, not as the work itself, he said.   ``When the artist was making his original statements, wesupported him, and when he wanted to change that, we allowed him todo that,'' said Jeanne Pearlman, executive director of the festival.   Fraternal groups representing Croatians, Poles, blacks and otherminorities said the matter benefited the community by prompting themto work together. The Pennsylvania Heritage Affairs Commission andthe United Steelworkers union also signed the statement.   ``The artist was the most amenable about the whole thing. Mr.Jimenez made the issue easy for resolution,'' said Steelworkersspokesman Gary Hubbard.   Jimenez said he was disappointed with the response to his work.   ``I wanted to raise certain issues about the contributionssteelworkers have made. I hoped it would be viewed with a sense ofpride,'' Jimenez said.</TEXT></DOC>
