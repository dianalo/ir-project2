Iran has claimed that France promised to free Anis Naccache, aLebanese national and convicted leader of a pro-Iranian terrorsquad, in exchange for three French hostages released in May.   Naccache is serving a life sentence for leading an assassinationattempt against former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar in1980. Bakhtiar survived but a French woman and a police officer werekilled.   Mitterrand said that when Chirac submitted his resignationfollowing elections that returned a Socialist government to powerlast spring, he did not ask for Naccache's release.   Speaking on the weekly television news show ``Seven on Seven,''Mitterrand said that Chirac assured him that the only committmentFrance had made was to promise ``to restore diplomatic relations''with Iran.   ``I have no reason to doubt the words of Mr. Chirac,'' thepresident said, adding that it was necessary for ``the Iranians toprovide proof that France has failed to meet its committments.   ``If such is the case, it is understood that France's word willbe kept. But to my knowledge, this is not the case.''   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas discussed the matter with hisIranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati while on a trip to Iran lastweek. Velayati said there was a gentlemen's agreement to freeNaccache, confirmed in telephone calls from Chirac to Iranianofficials.   The president of Iran's parliament, Hachemi Rafsandjani, onSaturday repeated the claim that Iran was guaranteed Naccache'srelease.   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said last week ``unfortunately, wehave no official report, no trace of the conditions in which therelease of the hostages was negotiated by the Chirac government.''   He said he asked for a written report from his predecessor,Charles Pasqua, who led the effort to free the hostages, but wasturned down.   Mitterrand noted in the interview Sunday that Naccache and fourother members of the terrorist gang ``were convicted of crimes.''   ``They are not hostages. We do not take hostages,'' he said.   There are 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. They include nineAmericans, three Britons, one Belgian, one Irishman and one Italian.The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
