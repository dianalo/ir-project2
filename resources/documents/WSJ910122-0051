Shareholders of these funds sustained average losses of31% in 1990, compared with a drop of just 3.1% for theStandard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A lot of inexperienced people got involved, and they paidthe price,&quot; says Ron Olin, a closed-end fund specialist withHouston's Deep Discount Advisors.   For fund investors, the demise of the country fundsprovides a cautionary tale. When it comes to investing inpublicly traded funds, owning a well-run fund isn't the onlykey to success. What price you pay can be just as big adeterminant.   Country fund fever, if you recall, started spreading inlate 1989, with lots of investors paying premium prices forfunds that invest in a single country. Especially popularwere the European funds, which were supposed to benefit fromthe fall of the Berlin Wall and a much-forecasted Europeaneconomic revival.   At first blush, some of these country funds don't appearto have done terribly. The Austria Fund's portfolio, forinstance, finished last year up 2.5%.   But Austria Fund shareholders have scant reason tocelebrate. In the course of 1990, these investors saw theirfund shares collapse 49.2%, according to Lipper AnalyticalServices, a Summit, N.J., fund research firm.   Here's why. Like other publicly traded funds, Austria Fundtrades on the stock market, and investors buy shares the sameway they would purchase stock in IBM or General Motors. Theshares of these so-called closed-end funds often trade atlarge premiums or steep discounts to the fund's per-shareportfolio value.   At the end of 1989, if you wanted to buy shares of theAustria Fund, you had to pay $1.68 for every $1 of underlyingportfolio value. But as 1990 wore on, country fund feverfizzled, and by year end investors were paying only 83 centsto get $1 of portfolio value. This collapse, from a heftypremium to a big discount, meant that investors lost almosthalf their money.   Other country fund investors also suffered mightily.According to Lipper Analytical, the average single countryfund was down 12.1% if you look at just portfolioperformance. But if instead you look at share-priceperformance, these funds fell 31% on average. (These figuresinclude both share price changes and reinvested dividends.)Only two of the 20 country funds tracked by Lipper finishedthe year with a stock market gain.   Why did country fund investors lose so much money? Theypaid far too much for the funds they bought. To see just howbig a mistake that can be, take a look at the 1990 stockmarket performance of the publicly traded stock funds thatstarted the year with the biggest premiums and discounts.   The five funds that started 1990 with the biggest premiumswere all single-country funds. These funds had averageportfolio losses of 12.8% for 1990. But the portfolio losseswere modest compared with the stock market losses borne byholders of these funds. On average, the stock price of thesefive funds fell 51.3%.   Now look what happened to the five funds that started 1990with the steepest discounts. This group included fundsspecializing in gold, small-company and financial stocks, allof which got pounded in 1990. Taken together, these fivefunds posted average portfolio losses of 34.9%.   Yet holders of these five beaten-up funds did better thanowners of the five country funds. On average, the stockprices of these five funds fell 18.1%, vs. the 51.3% drubbingincurred by the country funds.   That doesn't mean you should buy a fund just because ittrades at a steep discount. &quot;If you buy the funds with thebiggest discounts, you'll probably do OK,&quot; says Mr. Olin, ofDeep Discount Advisors. &quot;But some of these large discountsare justified.&quot;   One reason funds tend to trade at discounts, says Mr.Olin, is that the funds have operating expenses, which youwouldn't have to pay if you bought the fund's portfolioholdings directly. Over the long haul, Mr. Olin reckons,funds with higher operating expenses will tend to trade atsteeper discounts.   ---          What You See Isn't Always What You Get                                                                                                          The share price of some publicly traded stock funds felllast year, even while the fund's investment portfolio didrather well.
