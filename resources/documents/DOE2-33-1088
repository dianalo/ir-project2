The photo-oxidationof alcohols on TiO/sub 2/ depends on the initial quantity of OH ions.The transfer of photoproduced electrons to platinum deposits and thesubsequent consumption of this charge for H/sub 2/ formation, stronglydepends on the proton concentration in the bulk. The production of hydrogencan be optimized using a combination of photoelectrochemical and photocatalyticstudies, determining the balance between electron production on illuminatedsemiconductors and consumption of these charges on the surface of thecatalyst.</TEXT></DOC>
