Oil ministers from both sides will meet at a yet-undecided datefor further discussion on the issue, OPEC General Secretary Subrototold reporters after the daylong closed meeting.   The non-OPEC countries also stated in a communique that theysupported OPEC's goal of achieving a target price of $18 a barrel``as soon as possible.''   ``They agreed on the need to take further steps to enhanceimprovements already achieved and to further strengthen the oilmarket, especially in the second quarter of 1989,'' the communiqueread.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been tryingto enlist the support of non-OPEC producers since the cartel agreedat its November ministerial meeting to curtail its own production inorder to boost prices.   Since the OPEC agreement prices have moved higher, and the chiefU.S. crude _ West Texas Intermediate _ sporadically has topped $18 abarrel in recent futures trading.   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, fell to $16.25 a barrel Thursday night,down 43 cents from late Wednesday.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate plunged 40 cents to settle at $17.72 a barrel,the lowest level of Thursday's session. The contract had jumped 58cents on Wednesday.   The communique did not specify possible steps for supportingprices, although Subroto said a 5 percent production cut ``is anoption.''   Non-OPEC sources had speculated some of the independent producersmight offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent withoutrequesting reciprocal cuts from OPEC.   The two sides said they also agreed ``this initial effort shouldbe continued in the second half of the year and consolidatedthereafter to establish a more permanent, long-term cooperation forachieving durable oil market stability...''   Analysts said the futures markets may have been disappointed bythe lack of concrete plans.   ``They didn't recommend any specific action,'' said NaumanBarakat, vice president of energy investments at Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. in New York. ``Their statement was so vague that itdidn't really mean anything.''   The attending OPEC nations were Kuwait, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria. The other OPEC members areEcuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.   The communique from the independents said the non-OPEC groupconsisted of representatives of Angola, China, Colombia, Egypt,Malaysia, Mexico, and Oman and observers from the Soviet Union,Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic, the Canadian province of Albertaand the U.S. states of Alaska and Texas.   OPEC members agreed in November to limit their production to 18.5million barrels a day, effective Jan. 1.   OPEC members are producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels aday, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourthquarter. That has helped oil prices recover from around $12 a barrelin December.</TEXT></DOC>
