Hiromasa Ezoe, whose publishing conglomerate became the name ofthe scandal, told Judge Tadatsugu Watanabe and a team of some 20prosecutors that his gifts of discount shares and cash toinfluential public figures were not meant as bribes.   The 53-year-old Ezoe and former Recruit executive Toshiro Ono,39, both said they had ``absolutely no intention of bribery,'' butapologized for the trouble resulting from the Recruit scandal,which brought down two prime ministers and has severely shakenpublic confidence in the nation's leadership.   Takao Fujinami, a former key Cabinet minister, and KatsuyaIkeda, formerly a lawmaker with the opposition Komeito (CleanGovernment) party also pleaded innocent to receiving bribes fromRecruit but begged forgiveness for getting involved in the scandal.   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years inprison.   Their trial is the last of five trials against 12 executives andex-public officials that began last month as the Tokyo DistrictCourt delves into allegations of corruption in the nation's elite.   The Recruit scandal, which began in the summer of 1988, broughtdown Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and his successor, SousukeUno. Coupled with an unpopular sales tax, it remains a seriousproblem for the governing conservative party, which faces a generalelection sometime next year.   In the packed courtroom Friday, Ezoe responded to prosecutors'accusations by denying that he provided political donations andcut-rate shares to Fujinami and Ikeda as bribes to win favors fromthem. Prosecutors must prove the intention of bribery in order toget convictions.   Along with the other three defendants, he accused prosecutors offorcing him to admit to bribery charges under duress. ``Theprosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I tried toclose my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the point thatthey hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said.   ``I was questioned for over 20 hours and suffered physical andmental damage,'' said Ezoe's former aide Ono, who also protestedhis innocence.   Ezoe is being tried on seven counts of bribery and Ono on twocounts.   Fujinami, 57, who was chief Cabinet secretary when Recruit wasallegedly seeking to win special treatment for its fast-growingemployment-information and telecommunications businesses, admittedhe received from Recruit $140,000 and 10,000 shares in its realestate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos.   But he said he didn't personally accept the gifts or providespecial favors to Ezoe.   ``I would never think of doing that in my position as chiefCabinet secretary,'' Fujinami said in his brief statement. Due tohis involvement in the scandal, Fujinami has left the LiberalDemocratic Party but retains his seat in Parliament.   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos tohundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before thestocks were available to the general public.   When the shares hit the over-the-counter market, their priceshot up and the insiders made big profits. Fujinami's shares weresaid to have earned him $215,000.   Ezoe said Friday he had no idea the stocks would become sovaluable after their release to the public.   Ikeda, 52, who resigned from Parliament over the scandal,vehemently denied having any connection with Recruit and said hehad not personally accepted $49,000 in political donations or the5,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares supplied to his brother.   Prosecutors' charges that he gave speeches in Parliament as afavor to Recruit were ``absolutely untrue,'' Ikeda said. ``I gavethose speeches on my own initiative and based on my personalconvictions.''   Prosecutors presented hundreds of pages of evidence against thefour defendants in the trial, which is expected to drag on foryears as the legal system considers the fine line between cordialbusiness-government ties and outright corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
