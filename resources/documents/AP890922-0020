Survivors clung to the wings of the broken aircraft or graspedfloating timbers after the Boeing 737-400 slid into Bowery Bay offLaGuardia Airport at 11:29 p.m. Wednesday. Two women were killed,but 59 people including crew members survived.   The jet's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were analyzedThursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, but providedno immediate clues on the cause of the crash, said NTSB ChairmanJames Kolstad said.   ``There were no noises or voices that suggested there was anyproblem with the takeoff or why the takeoff was aborted,'' Kolstandsaid at an evening news conference at Kennedy Airport.   The flight data box recording indicated that the plane swervedslightly instead of moving straight down the runway and showed some``deviations'' in rudder movement, Kolstad said, but investigatorsdid not immediately understand what effect that might have had onthe takeoff.   Meanwhile, the New York Times in its Friday editions said lawenforcement officials were checking reports that the co-pilot toldPort Authority police shortly after the crash that the pilot hadbeen ``mumbling'' and ``acting irrationally'' just before takeoff.   However, Port Authority spokesman John Hughes said PA police hadno interviews with the crew after the crash. Commenting on the Timesreport, Hughes said, ``I have heard nothing about that.   The paper, quoting undentified airline industry officials, saidthe pilot and co-pilot had little experience aboard 737s. The pilothad flown the planes for only two months and the co-pilot was saidto have been in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time, the newspapersaid.   A tape-recorded message answered USAir's public relations officetelephone and referred all questions to the NTSB.   A spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board,Rachel Halterman, said the NTSB had ``no direct knowledge'' of theTimes report. She said until the pilots are interviewed, ``anythingelse is hearsay.''   The crew has not been interviewed yet by authorities and Kolstadhad no information about their experience or identities.   He said the NTSB had asked for drug and alcohol tests for thecrew and plans to interview the pilot and co-pilot Friday. They havethe right to decline to speak with investigators but can besubpoenaed if they refuse, said NTSB spokeswoman Rachel Halterman.   USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny declined to discuss any details orpossible causes of the crash, saying the NTSB had jurisdiction.   ``The captain is taking advice of his own counsel,'' Colodny saidat a news conference. He declined to identify the pilot or othercrew members or describe their experience, other than to say theyhad been based in Baltimore and had worked for Piedmont Aviationbefore its merger with USAir in August.   Flight 5050, bound for Charlotte, N.C., was accelerating down therunway in a light rain when the control tower acknowledged thepilot's request to abort and cleared him to turn onto the lasttaxiway before the end of the runway.   Farrar said a pilot would not be required to get permission toabort takeoff. He said it was not immediately clear exactly at whatpoint the communication with the tower occurred or which member ofthe flight crew was at the radio but it likely was whichever pilotwas not controlling the plane at the time.   ``The pilot seemed to be accelerating but didn't have enoughpower to get the plane up,'' said passenger Larry Martin. ``He puton the brakes. The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew allhell broke loose.''   The plane broke into three parts about 50 to 100 feet into BoweryBay, its front sections resting above the water on a trestle thatheld runway lights, its back sections submerged. The two women whodied were seated in the rear.   ``People were on top of each other. People were screaming,'' saidMartin, who was traveling with his wife, Valerie. ``There was thesmell of gas. Everyone was saying `Get out! Get out! Get out!' ''   Stunned passengers scramled out doors and onto wings. Someescaped down an emergency chute and found themselves in about 25feet of water. Many clung to wings or grasped floating timbers.   ``I said, hell, this thing is going to blow up,'' said passengerFred O'Loughlin. ``Then all of a sudden I was in the water bymyself.''   ``The crew was great. ... They were pitching people out and downthe slide,'' said passenger Tom Newberry, 27. ``We just grabbed onto a big piece of wood and held on for dear life.''   Police scuba divers freed as many as 15 people who were trappedin the cabin, while rescuers in boats scooped passengers from thewater or off the wings. ``They were hanging from the pier, hangingon the wing, hanging from the front of the plane,'' said police Lt.Larry Johnston.   Rescuers, working under the glare of emergency lights, placedslings under the tail section to keep it from sinking and had allsurvivors ashore within 40 minutes.   Authorities did not identify the women who died, but a relativesaid they were Betsy Hayter Brogan, in her 30s, of Gray, Tenn., andher mother-in-law, Alice Brogan of Roanoke, Va. The relative, JackHayter of Morristown, Tenn., said the younger woman was a nurse whohad a 5-year-old son.   There were 55 passengers and six crew members on the plane,Colodny said. Forty-five people went to hospitals, and USAir VicePresident Jack Long said eight remained hospitalized. One was hurtseriously and had undergone surgery for ``blunt trauma.''   Flight 5050 was added to the schedule after an earlier flight wascanceled because of bad weather, airline spokeswoman Susan Youngsaid. It was raining lightly at the time of the crash, but BillCahill, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,which operates the airport, said weather was not a factor.   The plane was 9 months old and it had no history of mechanicalproblems, said airline spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan. A three-memberBoeing crash team planned to examine the aircraft.   A 737-400 operated by British Midland Airways crashed Jan. 8north of London, killing 44 people. Investigators said the crash mayhave resulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenlyshutting down the other engine, but no official report has beenissued.   Many uninjured survivors huddled in blankets at a terminalbuilding. Others spoke from hospital beds.   Joseph Pankow, a North Carolina businessman, recalled trying toreassure a woman who was screaming in panic after the plane came torest. ``I said, `Calm down, you're going to make it, we're all goingto make it. Let's pray together and let's get out of this airplane.'   ``A lady was next to me with a small baby, and I've been aroundjust 40 years, but that baby's been around not even 40 months,'' hesaid. ``So, for that baby to live and be safe tonight is a dream forme,'' Pankow said. ``And I only pray that the families that havesuffered the losses of their cherished folks, that they're OK andthey try to understand.''</TEXT></DOC>
