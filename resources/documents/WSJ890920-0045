The unit is being purchased by management-led UCC Investors, which has agreed in principle to pay costs caused by the delay, &quot;including any additional taxes the company may incur,&quot; Avery said. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is financial adviser for the buyers.    Avery has agreed to sell the unit to the management-led group for $227.5 million cash and $12.5 million in securities. Uniroyal Chemical Holding is the parent of Uniroyal Chemical Co., a maker of pesticides, rubber additives, and other chemical products.    New York-based Avery has said that, after it sells Uniroyal Chemical, it expects to have $20 million to $25 million in cash and no other material assets or liabilities and plans to use the proceeds to acquire a business. </TEXT></DOC>
