(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AD/CYCLE APPEARS ON CASE CHECKLISTandM;Systems Application Architecture (SAA) compliance is quickly becoming a keychecklist item of corporations purchasing Case tools.andM;So far that compliance primarily means that the Case tools utilize the IBMCommon User Access (CUA) interface and support an SAA-compliant hardwareplatform--the OS/2-based PS/2 personal computer, an AS/400 minicomputer or aSystem/370 mainframe.andP;  According to both users and third-party vendors, theseCase tools must also promise to access the IBM Repository Manager/MVSoffering.andM;The IBM SAA strategy for Case is tied to its AD/Cycle blueprint, which isintended to utilize third-party tools with the IBM SAA hardware and themainframe Repository Manager/MVS data storage facility.andP;  The AD/Cycleblueprint is described as the SAA specifications for software development.andM;Repository Manager/MVS, the key IBM component of AD/Cycle, began shippingthis summer to several sites, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York.andP;  Thefirst release of Repository Manager/MVS includes a repository engine, a panelinterface and an SAA Common Programming Interface.andP;  A workstation interfacewas announced in September and will ship in the first quarter of 1991.andM;Workstation access to the Repository is &quot;where SAA-ness comes into Case,&quot;said Christopher Bird, president of Model Systems Consultants Inc., aStamford, Conn., consulting firm and Case software developer.andM;&quot;The Repository that IBM has released is lacking in features,&quot; Bird said,adding that he is also &quot;somewhat disappointed in what [he sees] in theRepository Information Model.&quot;andP;  That model, an outline of the design ofRepository Manager/MVS, was in the hands of 60 software suppliers early lastmonth.andP;  An IBM spokesman said the model would be made widely available for anominal license fee, but the details remain to be worked out.andM;Sources who attended a meeting of the Guide IBM user group this summer inChicago say that some IBM officials hinted that a second, more comprehensiveversion of the Information Model will be completed and distributed by the endof 1990.andP;  Changes were expected in early September.andM;For large IBM users, SAA and AD/Cycle must be part of a plan for softwaredevelopment functions despite any current limitations of the blueprint, saidDavid Sharon, president of Case Associates Inc., an Oregon City, Ore., Caseconsultant.andP;  For example, Sharon said he is recommending that his clientsfollow the specifications of SAA and AD/Cycle.andM;&quot;SAA compliance is something large data centers have to include in long-rangestrategic plans,&quot; Sharon said.andM;&quot;SAA is so far a good objective and a positive statement,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;Ithink that today it's one of the driving issues behind Case.&quot;andM;Observers have said the first version of Repository Manager/MVS cannot beused for comprehensive Case projects that require many tools.andP;  But most agreethat the offering is important in providing a base on which suppliers canwrite the tools to be used by customers.andM;For example, even Merrill Lynch, which has installed Repository Manager/MVS,is still using the Brownstone DB2 data dictionary from Brownstone Solutions,New York, to store software development data destined for the Repository.andM;&quot;Nobody is using the Repository like it's supposed to be used yet,&quot; declaredMaxine Glassman, manager of the Development Technology Center at MerrillLynch.andP;  Merrill Lynch expects the transition from Brownstone to theRepository to be &quot;very easy&quot; because of the company's understanding of theRepository Information Model, garnered through KnowledgeWare Inc.andM;IBM owns a minority stake in KnowledgeWare, an Atlanta-based Case tooldeveloper, and has signed agreements for joint development and jointmarketing of various products under AD/Cycle.andM;Despite the current limitations in SAA and AD/Cycle, many large users arealready moving development operations toward each of the blueprints byimplementing as many specifications as possible.andM;&quot;We're looking for the traditional benefits [from SAA and AD/Cycle],&quot; saidBob Napier, a senior consultant at a Lockheed Corp. facility in Teaneck, N.J.andO;&quot;We want to reduce the delivery time on software development.&quot;andM;AD/Cycle is a key part of the SAA strategy for buyers of Case tools andrepresents an important statement of definition by IBM on its view of thefuture of software development, Glassman said.andM;&quot;With AD/Cycle, IBM has finally admitted that there is no integrated Case,that no one vendor can supply everything,&quot; Glassman said.andP;  IBM has determinedthat &quot;the best way is component Case,&quot; or a &quot;best of breed&quot; strategy, shesaid.andM;&quot;We are looking at AD/Cycle as a framework that makes sense,&quot; said JerryKing, a senior systems consultant at Unum Life Insurance Co., Portland,Maine.andP;  &quot;Unum is traditionally a Big Blue shop, so we were sold on SAA andAD/Cycle early on.&quot;andM;So far, however, the AD/Cycle promise has not been fulfilled by IBM or itsthird-party partners, King maintained.andP;  &quot;What we're finding is that there isnot really any compatibility yet between the [different vendors'] tools.&quot;andM;King noted that the insurance carrier expects to continue using Telon, a codegenerator from Pansophic Systems Inc., Lisle, Ill., even though it is &quot;not anAD/Cycle-approved technology.andM;&quot;It is important that a tool be approved by IBM, but we're not going to waituntil the Repository is available&quot; before implementing a software developmentoperation, King said.andM;James Emerson, president of Repository Strategies Inc., a Naperville, Ill.,andO;consulting firm that plans to develop AD/Cycle-compliant tools for theRepository, agreed that &quot;the value of AD/Cycle is in the long run.&quot;andM;The full AD/Cycle concept will not be workable without RepositoryManager/MVS, which &quot;as an engine is really not there yet,&quot; said Emerson.andO;&quot;Today, the Repository is like an engine with no car.&quot;andP;  However, Emerson saidthat large firms can immediately utilize Repository Manager/MVS formainframe-based development projects through its panel interface.andM;However, King admitted that Unum &quot;will never stray too far from where wecan't&quot; utilize the AD/Cycle framework once it is available.andM;One AD/Cycle Business Partner tool the company does use is the Re-EngineeringProduct Set from Bachman Information Systems, Burlington, Mass.andM;&quot;We think Bachman's vision of reengineering and object-oriented technology isright on the mark,&quot; said King.andP;  Unum is utilizing Bachman products to rewritesoftware written for the IDMS database, from Computer AssociatesInternational Inc., Garden City, N.Y., to the DB2 DBMS of IBM.andM;King described the Excelerator offering from Index Technology Corp.,andO;Cambridge, Mass., as a &quot;good tactical&quot; tool.andP;  Excelerator is anAD/Cycle-approved package that also includes links to DEC VAX/VMS-basedminicomputers and to other hardware.andM;However, Unum currently has no plans to purchase KnowledgeWare products, Kingsaid.andM;Although the Information Services Division of Lockheed Corp., Sunnyvale,Calif., uses hardware from multiple vendors, &quot;SAA is important as an evolvingframework,&quot; said Phyllis Andrews, senior staff consultant.andP;  &quot;So far, SAA onlydoes vertical integration,&quot; Andrews said.andP;  &quot;We also need horizontalintegration.andP;  At Lockheed, we use many different [computer] systems.andP;  We'renot just an IBM house and we probably never will be.&quot;andM;Andrews said the company is hoping to eventually utilize the benefits of SAAand AD/Cycle while maintaining the multivendor hardware.andP;  Lockheed'sdevelopers also use Excelerator, he said.andM;Richard Carpenter, president of Index Technology, compares the SAA andAD/Cycle strategies of IBM to its earlier moves to standardize MS-DOS.andM;&quot;I think a lot of people are comparing [SAA and AD/Cycle] to eight years agowhen IBM identified DOS as the standard and invited third parties to developsoftware and hardware for it,&quot; Carpenter said.andP;  &quot;I think you can say the samekind of thing is happening today in the Case world.&quot;andM;THE INNER CIRCLEandM;Analysts say the major beneficiaries of AD/Cycle so far are the five Casesoftware vendors that make up the inner circle of IBM partners--IndexTechnology Corp., KnowledgeWare Inc., Bachman Information Systems Inc., SynonInc., Larkspur, Calif., and Systematica of Dorset, England.andM;&quot;There are tremendous marketing advantages&quot; for those companies, said Bird ofModel Systems.andP;  However, Bird added, &quot;I'm not sure exactly what SAA means toCase.&quot;andM;Paul Bloom, an analyst with Volpe, Welty andamp; Co., a San Francisco investmentbanking firm, contends that AD/Cycle is an attempt by IBM &quot;to lock in itscommercial MIS customers and prevent them from considering other hardwarefrom DEC or Unix vendors.andP;  Experience has shown that such all-encompassinginformation control strategies have great intellectual appeal but break downwhen confronted with the reality of different systems.&quot;andM;IBM staunchly denies that the AD/Cycle architecture is an attempt to lockcustomers in.andP;  An IBM spokesman said, &quot;We have an open architecture.&quot;andM;Despite Bloom's criticism of AD/Cycle, he predicts that the inner circle willsee growth due to their relationships with IBM.andM;Gary Williams, VP of advanced technology at KnowledgeWare, said the firm'snew OS/2-based Application Development Workbench (ADW) integrated Casetoolset already meets most existing SAA specifications for Case tools.andP;  Hemaintains this capability gives the company an early advantage.andP;  &quot;Most of ourcustomers are already&quot; requiring SAA compliance.andM;&quot;ADW was designed to run in OS/2, it has a CUA-compliant user interface andit was written in C,&quot; Williams said.andP;  The company sold 7,000 ADW packagesfrom June through mid-August, he claimed.andM;Williams said that ADW users can now take advantage of the IBM Repositorybecause &quot;ADW is already enabled to Repository Manager.andP;  We've got customersusing our tools today to derive benefit&quot; from Repository Manager/MVS, hesaid.andM;Most of the work is being done to &quot;get experience&quot; in using the IBM package,Williams said.andP;  The ADW software incorporates all the capabilities ofKnowledgeWare's MS-DOS-based Information Engineering Workbench, which thefirm continues to market.andM;The company also promises that ADW will offer distributed processingcapabilities as required by SAA, Williams said.andP;  &quot;The [SAA and AD/Cycle] planis already well-defined and partially rolled out,&quot; he contended.andM;Williams said the KnowledgeWare agreement with IBM goes beyond jointmarketing to a licensing pact under which IBM can incorporate KnowledgeWaretechnology into future offerings, including, say observers, RepositoryManager/MVS.andM;Index, meanwhile, has announced an OS/2 version of its Excelerator Case tool,which has been under development for more than a year.andP;  Carpenter declined tosay when the product is scheduled to ship.andM;Bachman Information Systems contends that it was developing SAA-compliantsoftware long before IBM invested in the firm.andM;&quot;They invested because we were doing it [supporting SAA] already,&quot; saidHoward Sorkin, technology vice president at Bachman.andP;  &quot;We were alreadyworking with OS/2 before they started working with us.&quot;andP;  Sorkin also notedthat Bachman &quot;was in DB2 early on and supports the SAA CUA interface.&quot;andM;Developers of software for the IBM AS/400 minicomputer are flocking to SynonInc., the last third-party vendor appointed to the IBM AD/Cycle inner circle,for SAA-compliant software development tools.andP;  Synon markets the Synon/2Eintegrated package that incorporates a code generator that can produce Cobolor RPG code.andM;&quot;We picked Synon because they were picked by IBM,&quot; said John Fanning, MISdirector at Skillpath Inc., Mission, Kans., which conducts seminars onproject management.andP;  &quot;The code generator of Synon knows all the [SAA] rulesso it will create cleaner software faster&quot; than noncompliant tools, he said.andO;Synon can exchange specifications with IBM's S/370 generator, CSP, usingExternal Source Format.andM;&quot;I'm a fan of CUA and to a larger extent SAA,&quot; Fanning said.andP;  &quot;My onlycriticism of IBM's [SAA] strategy is that they tend to try to achievecommonality, to support all platforms.andP;  They should just utilize a fewstrategic platforms,&quot; such as the AS/400.andM;Developers of AS/400 software are also looking to the Synon tools for SAAcompliance.andM;For example, Advanced Logic Systems, a Marietta, Ga., developer of financialapplications for the AS/400, utilizes the Synon tools so that &quot;we don't haveto worry about being SAA compliant,&quot; said Karl Touset, vice president ofsales and marketing.andM;Touset also said the firm expects that it will be able to offer its productline for other IBM hardware platforms by maintaining SAA compatibility.andM;Neil Hamilton, president of Contoc Business Systems, a Willowdale, Ont.,andO;developer of AS/400-based distribution and light manufacturing software, isalso looking to Synon to provide AS/400 compliance to its software packages.andM;Contoc, too, is looking to SAA to allow it to sell its software for other SAAcomputer lines.andP;  &quot;We want SAA to be a standard, not just limited to theAS/400 but also to go beyond,&quot; Hamilton said.andM;Synon President Christopher Herron said the company is looking to maintain atechnical advantage in the AS/400 Case market as evidenced by about 21% ofits personnel working in the Randamp;D operation.andM;New Synon/2E capabilities under development include target platforms such asOS/2EE, Herron said, adding that the PC operating system &quot;won't be the onlynew target platform.&quot;andM;CARTNER ANALYSIS:andM;CASEandM;AD/Cycle is an initiative in which IBM has embraced designated BusinessPartners and IBM products into a framework based on its Repository and otherservices.andP;  Some degree of common &quot;look and feel&quot; among AD/Cycle tools isbeing achieved, due to their emerging conformance to SAA/CUA standards.andO;However, a more meaningful integration of these disparate products into acohesive application development environment will depend much more on anAD/Cycle infrastructure that has yet to mature.andM;While we believe the vision of AD/Cycle is sound in an arena where IBM willultimately set standards for IBM/SAA environments, we have concerns withrespect to AD/Cycle's initial scope, its degree of integration and the slowevolution of the critical AD/Information Model of the Repository.andM;IBM's External Source Format (ESF) provides a mechanism for interfacing amongtools.andP;  But ESF is limited because it defines a relation between the CSP codegenerator and tools that integrate to the generator.andP;  ESF does not extend tothe integration of testing, debugging or prototyping tools, for example.andP;  Thepromise of the AD/Information Model is to further integrate the applicationdevelopment environment.andM;AD/Cycle has also been implicitly positioned as the architecture andenvironment to generate SAA applications.andP;  If SAA is to be a set ofprotocols, services and standards to make applications interoperable acrossIBM platforms, ideally AD/Cycle would allow the generation of SAA-compliantapplications across all SAA platforms, executing cooperatively.andM;Although AD/Cycle will have utility value beginning in 1991 in its ability tointegrate IBM's Case Business Partner tools, it will not enable, in our view,repository-based, Case-driven generation of such SAA multitiered cooperativeapplications.andM;IBM has to meet the following challenges:andM;* delivery of remaining SAA services across SAA platforms;andM;* maturation of the AD/Information Model;andM;* availability of truly integrated life-cycle tools;andM;* delivery of a more modernized CSP capable of generating multiplatform,graphical user interface and cooperative applications across SAA platforms;andandM;* solutions to software distribution, version and configuration management.andM;The AD/Cycle vision and product plan will continue to evolve over the nextseveral years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
