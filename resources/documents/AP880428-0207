(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shell Oil Co. acknowledged that anillegal practice allowed 175,000 gallons of crude oil to seep intobird sanctuaries and bays, killing almost 200 waterfowl and otherwildlife and threatening more Thursday.   Larry Kolb, principal engineer with the state Regional WaterQuality Control Board, called the spill an ecological disaster andestimated that it could cost Shell $3 million in penalties and $1million in cleanup costs.   About 100 cleanup workers Thursday were rushed into areawetlands where winds and rising tides threatened to expand thespill, which occurred during the nesting season 40 miles northeastof San Francisco.   The spill occurred Friday night or early Saturday when adrainpipe that carries off rainwater through the middle of an oiltank at Shell's major northern California refinery broke inside thetank, allowing oil to be siphoned out.   Shell said Wednesday that it regularly allowed rain collectedfrom the roof of the tank to flow uninspected into a nearby marsh.   The practice violated federal Environmental Protection Agencyregulations, Shell's written policies and standard industrypractice, refinery manager Ron Banducci said.   He said he had no explanation for the deviation from establishedprocedures and EPA requirements.   ``While the investigation is continuing, the management of thisrefinery takes full responsibility'' for the accident, Shellspokesman Gene Munger said Thursday.   The practice of discharging the storm water without inspectionwas not followed at any of the 173 other tanks at the 1,000-acrerefinery, said Banducci.   ``In our view, leaving the valve open when rain is predicted isnot control (of rain discharges) in any sense of the word,'' Kolbsaid Thurssday.   About 126,000 gallons of the San Joaquin crude, a particularlythick oil, have been recovered from a 15-mile stretch alongCarquinez Strait and the Peyton Marsh, which adjoins the refinery.   Crews raced to remove the oil, much of it stuck to rocks andmarsh reeds, before rain or an exceptionally high tide of 5.5 feetdue on Saturday can spread it.   High tides and gusty winds late Wednesday pushed up to 1,600gallons of oil out of the marsh into the waters of Suisun Bay, tothe east, and Carquinez Strait, northeast of the San Francisco Bay,said Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze.   State Fish and Game Department officials flew over Ryer and Roeislands about six miles from the spill and found ``lots of birds,lots of oil.''   ``Some of the oil has gotten into areas where it wasn't before,primarily the nesting areas out there, and that's bad for sure,''said Brian Hunter, fish and game regional manager.   By Thursday morning, 447 oily birds and animals had been pickedup from polluted areas, said Hunter. Of those, 189 were either deador died during the rescue. The animals included 32 mammals andeight reptiles.   Kolb said damaged areas may take a year or more to recover.   On Wednesday, wildlife crews blasted gas-powered cannons tofrighten birds from nesting marshes and set up ``zon'' guns,propane gas-powered cannons, to scare birds away from fouled areas.   About 50 members of the California Conservation Corps were sentto help clean up the Martinez Marina, where some 400 boats weretrapped in the harbor. Many belonged to fishermen upset they wouldmiss this weekend's fishing.   Most of their boats had oil stains on the hulls, and by federalregulations must be cleaned before being allowed out of the marina.   Salmon season opens Sunday, and steelhead are spawning in theSacramento River.</TEXT></DOC>
