Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., one of the bill's sponsors.   The bill, approved 81-17 after two days of debate, now goes tothe House. It was originally designed to cap immigration at 600,000in each of the next three years but was expanded by 30,000 visasbefore final passage.   The ceiling represents 136,000 more visas than were issued in1988, but but critics say the bill still could reduce visas for allbut the closest relatives of American citizens and permanentresidents of the United States.   The Senate approved a similar bill in 1988 but it died in theHouse.   The measure now goes to the House with Kennedy and the measure'sco-sponsor, Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., saying they are optimisticabout the prospects this year.   Lawmakers voted 78-21 to expand the cap by 30,000 visas a yearfollowing an emotional appeal from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., whorecalled how his father fled ``the boot of the czar'' in 1911 andarrived in America ``with no rubles in his pocket. He had to comesteerage.''   ``There is nothing magic to me about the number 600,000,''Specter said.   But senators fought back 52-46 a move by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz,R-Minn., to expand by 40,000 the number of brothers and sisters ofAmerican citizens that would be allowed into the country annually.   ``My heart is on the side of what Sen. Boschwitz is doing,'' Sen.Paul Simon, D-Ill., said. But he added that ``there is a saturationpoint with the American public and I want to be prudent as we moveahead.''   Simpson said it was ``time to face the unfortunate but hideouslycold reality that there are many more people who want to come herethan there is room or intent to accommodate them.''   Following intense floor skirmishing, the Senate did approve anamendment from Sen. Richard C. Shelby, D-Ala., that would force theCensus Bureau to halt its practice of including illegal aliens inits official count.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said that under the current system``states like California would gain a (congressional) seat at NorthCarolina's expense'' because their populations are swollen withillegal aliens.   Kennedy called the amendment ``flatly unconstitutional,'' butlawmakers refused 58-41 to kill it and eventually adopted it on avoice vote.   The legislation would reserve 120,000 visas annually for thoseentering on a basis other than family ties.   That category includes 54,000 visas subject to a point systemgiving credit for those with special skills needed by Americanindustry but who do not have employers ready to sponsor them.   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-2 to delete the provisionthat would provide extra points to individuals who speak English.Simpson appealed to the Senate in vain to restore the point systembut lawmakers rejected the idea, 56-43.   ``English is the language of success,'' he declared. He saidthose who are unable to understand English will have a tough timeobtaining jobs and urged lawmakers not to be swayed by sentimentalportrayals as immigrants as the heart and soul of the American dream.   ``The heart and soul disappears when you can't get work,'' hesaid.   Simon, however, quoted a news clipping that said 13 of the 16valedictorians in Boston's publish high schools this year were bornin foreign countries and the majority apparently did not haveEnglish for a mother tongue.   Simpson expressed frustration that the sentiment-tinged debateappeared to be going against him.   ``You have snorted and ripped and rolled around in it and youhave just given birth to a mouse,'' he declared.   Meanwhile, the House approved, 358-44, and sent to the Senateseparate legislation to ease immigration of certain Soviet andSoutheast Asian refugees.   It would temporarily re-establish the legal status of Soviet Jewsand evangelican Christians as well as certain categories ofVietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians as persecuted, withoutindividuals having to prove it in their own cases. That would aidthem in obtaining standing as refugees.   The measure is opposed by the Bush administration, which contendsit unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certainrefugees and makes it more difficult to administer the U.S. refugeeprogram fairly.   Those voting against the measure were Sens. John Breaux, D-La.;Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.; Kent Conrad, D-N.D.;Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; J. James Exon Jr., D-Neb., Wendell Ford,D-Ky.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Jesse Helms,R-N.C.; Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; BarbaraMikulski, D-Md.; Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Shelby,and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.   Not voting were Sens. James Jeffords, R-N.H., and SparkMatsunaga, D-Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
