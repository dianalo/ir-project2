Researchers at the University of Arizona are testing newly synthesized chemical variations of &quot;melanocyte-stimulating hormone,&quot; or MSH. This is the hormone that triggers certain skin cells -- melanocytes -- to produce the pigment melanin. Sunlight can spur the production of melanin to produce a tan.    The new chemical variations, or analogs, of MSH were synthesized by chemist Victor J. Hruby and their biological properties determined by anatomist-biologist Mac Hadley. Animal tests show they are more potent than the natural hormone, and more resistant to being broken down by the body's enzymes. They also appear to be nontoxic. The animal tests indicate that if the chemicals are dabbed on skin, they soak through, enter the circulation and produce a darkening over the whole body. The chemicals are expected to produce a tan identical to that of lying in the sun.    The two researchers are seeking U.S. government permission to begin human tests to see if the compounds will soak through human skin as they do through animal skin, says Mr. Hruby. If they work, the chemicals will be useful in giving a protective tan to light-skinned people who tend to burn in sunlight. Such people are susceptible to sun-induced skin cancer.    Patent licensing on the new chemicals has been turned over to University Patents Inc., Westport, Conn., which is negotiating with at least one company interested in developing the compounds for human use, Mr. Hruby says.    Irregular heart rhythms can be cured with laser surgery.    Heart attacks and other manifestations of coronary heart disease often foul up the heart's electrical system, leaving victims susceptible to potentially fatal irregular heart beats. Drugs can control and prevent such arrhythmias, but in some patients the drugs don't work and surgeons have to operate, stilling the heart and opening the lower left chamber. After &quot;mapping&quot; the electrical circuitry inside and outside the heart, the surgeons destroy offending tissue by removing it with a scalpel or killing it with an ultracold &quot;cryoprobe.&quot;    Now a team headed by surgeon Robert H. Svenson at the Heineman Medical Research Center in Charlotte, N.C., is using a laser beam to destroy arrhythmia-producing heart tissues. The beam is directed through thin, flexible optical fibers that can reach nooks and crannies inside the heart beyond the reach of scalpel or cryoprobe. Not only is the laser procedure faster and more precise, but it can also be done while the heart is in the grip of irregular beating. Thus, the surgeons can tell immediately if the surgery stops the irregular rhythm rather than waiting days to see if the arrhythmias recur.    Of the first 17 patients, including some operated on as emergencies, only two died during or shortly after surgery. Of the remaining 15, only one redeveloped an arrhythmia, mild enough to be controlled with a drug.    Holography may help drivers keep their eyes on the road.    Engineers at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, in work funded by Ford Motor Co., have developed a system that projects an image of the speedometer and other dashboard instruments into a driver's eyes. To the driver the images appear to float in space just above the front end of the car.    The driver, who can turn on the system at will, can thus scan the dashboard without having to refocus his or her eyes. Ordinarily, refocus time -- from road to dashboard to road -- can run three-tenths of a second or longer, and can be disastrous at critical moments.    The system uses a special mirror, manufactured with a laser, that selectively reflects only the light emitted by the digital dials common on most new cars. One mirror mounted under the dashboard picks up the light from the dial and bounces it to a second special mirror, on the windshield, which reflects the image to the driver's eyes. If mass-produced, the system would add &quot;a few hundred dollars&quot; to the cost of a car, says Tom Noble, who oversees Battelle's licensing of new technology.    The system might also be used to project signs into the eyes of people entering a building, Mr. Noble suggests. New types of video games might use 3-D images floating in space. Ford and Battelle will license patents to applicants who are willing to fund development work on special applications, Mr. Noble says. Ford hasn't revealed its own plans for the system, if any. </TEXT></DOC>
