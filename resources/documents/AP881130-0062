Also today, political leaders considered a recommendation by apresidential panel that drastic curbs be placed on the national andmilitary intelligence agencies to end their domestic spying and keepthem out of politics.   Thousands of riot troopers in green combat fatigues and visoredhelmets blocked the protesters with shields as they tried to marchtowards the palace. ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Punish (President) RohTae-woo!'' protesters yelled.   Police scuffled with protesters after they marched out of a citycenter subway station where they first held an evening rally todemand Roh be removed from office and Chun be put on trial for humanrights abuses.   Unable to break through the police lines, 1,500 protesters thenmarched through the main shopping district, yelling slogans andscattering leaflets.   A few firebombs were hurled at a government office but did notcause any damage. Riot police moved in to disperse the marchers withtear gas grenades.   Dozens of protesters hurled firebombs and rocks at police in abrief clash as other marchers fled.   There were no reports of arrests or injuries.   The protest was smaller than major protests Nov. 19 and 26 whenthousands of people demanding Chun's arrested clashed with police inSeoul.   About 200 students demanding Chun's arrest battled police withfirebombs in a separate protest Wednesday in Songnam on Seoul'ssouthern outskirts.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing, wentinto internal exile last week after apologizing to the nation foralleged corruption and human rights abuses under his rule.   Roh appealed for mercy for Chun, but opposition and dissidentgroups insist the former president answer questions about thealleged corruption.   Several of Chun's close associates and relatives have beenconvicted of or charged with corruption and other offenses. Theformer president has denied he was involved in any corruption.   Government officials had no immediate response to recommendationsmade Tuesday by the Public Administration Reform Commission, whichwas set up by Roh to recommend government changes.   The commission said the Agency for National Security Planning,formerly known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, shouldconfine its domestic activities to fighting espionage andsubversion. It should not be used for political purposes and shouldoperate under the law, the agency said.   ``The agency has been criticized harshly by the people because ofits political maneuvers and abuse of power which resulted in humanrights violations,'' said Shin Hyun-hwack, chairman of thecommission.   The commission also recommended confining the military's DefenseSecurity Command to gathering and analyzing military intelligence.   The national security agency, which would still conduct overseasintelligence operations, is a large, shadowy organization that oftenhas played a major role in enforcing the rule of past authoritariangovernments.   Both intelligence agencies have traditionally play major roles indomestic politics.   Roh in a speech to the nation Saturday pledged to revise thetough national security laws often used by the agencies.   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections in December,has pledged to remove authoritarian controls.   Other recommendations included limiting the number of domesticoffices of the national security agency; reducing its authoritywithin the government; and subjecting the agency to governmentauditing.   Government sources, meanwhile, indicated a new Cabinet and othermajor changes would be announced by early next week. Up to 11ministers could be removed because of their ties with Chun,according to press reports.</TEXT></DOC>
