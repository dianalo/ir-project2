Ourtrains even ran during World War II,'' said Chou Chin-sung,director of the main Taipei railroad station.   Loudspeakers at the station broadcast apologies to strandedpassengers and urged them to collect refunds on their tickets andtake buses.   Chou estimated the strike would cost the Taiwan RailwayAdministration, which runs most of this island's passenger andfreight services, $1.2 million.   The trains carry roughly 360,000 passengers on a regular Sunday.   The Train Drivers Club, which represents 1,500 workers, calledthe strike to coincide with the May Day labor holiday. It tolddrivers to return to work Monday.   The drivers work 12 hours a day and earn an average monthlysalary of $700. They want a 10 percent increase.   The rail administration has offered to increase salaries 4percent to 8 percent.   Chang Shou-tsen, director of the railway administration, toldreporters the administration would meet with the strikers to try tonegotiate a settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
