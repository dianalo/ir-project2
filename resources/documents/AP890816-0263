The shortened trading day didn't harm the market. The exchange'scomposite index rose 11.27 points to close at 4,013.36 in amoderately active trading of 32.5 million shares.   Trading stopped 11 minutes after the market opened at 9:30 a.m.and didn't resume again until 12:31 p.m. It closed at its usual timeof 4 p.m.   Trading continued on the exchange's CATS system _ computerassisted trading system _ where the exchange's smaller companies arehandled. But only about 20 per cent of the exchange's trading occurson CATS.</TEXT><TEXT>   ``It's one of those things you have to accept if you're going toenjoy the benefits of the computer's assistance in trading,'' saidFred Ketchen, senior vice-president of Scotia McLeod and chairman ofthe exchange's market functions committee.   Most securities firms were able to circumvent the problem byrouting their trading through other stock markets, he said.   The exchange attributed the problem to a ``double hardwarefailure'' in the trading system, said Revell.   The primary information-storing computer disk system and itsbackup both failed, Revell said.</TEXT></DOC>
