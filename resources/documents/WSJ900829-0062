Despite opposition by Iran, a majority of OPEC's ministersagreed early yesterday to endorse production increases by anyof the 13 member nations with unused capacity. That actionwould temporarily suspend output quotas established by thegroup in July, and sanction combined additional output ofabout three million barrels of oil a day by Saudi Arabia,Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's an agreement to allow those who can do so toincrease production on a temporary basis,&quot; Diego Tamariz,Ecuador's oil minister, said in an interview, adding: &quot;Oncethe crisis is over, we will go back to the July agreement.&quot;   Though sought by the three countries, OPEC's approval oftheir plans to raise output doesn't change the prevailingoutlook for oil supplies. That's because the nations involvedpreviously indicated they would go ahead without OPECsanction if necessary. So world oil markets have beenoperating for weeks on the assumption the added oileventually would be coming.   The ministers held off announcing their decision so thatabsent representatives from Libya and Iraq could be notifiedthat the informal talks that began Sunday had been turnedinto an official meeting of the organization's ministerialmonitoring committee.   The output increases authorized by the meeting here won'tfully replace the four million barrels a day of oil removedfrom world oil markets by the current embargo by consumingnations against crude from Iraq and Iraq-occupied Kuwait. Asa result, OPEC also plans to call on the International EnergyAgency to help replace some of the lost oil.   The Paris-based group is an organization of 21 majoroil-consuming nations formed in the wake of the oil shocks ofthe 1970s to share supplies during shortages.   OPEC plans to ask the IEA to have its members' governmentsdraw on oil they hold in storage and to share immediately the&quot;present huge inventories&quot; of petroleum owned by oilcompanies. OPEC's specific goal is that some of that oil beshared with developing countries that don't have such stocks.   Iran has tried to persuade OPEC to postpone any productionincreases until the end of September while consuming nationsuse up their oil stockpiles. Yesterday, Iranian oil ministerGholamreza Aghazadeh recommended that the ministerialcommittee meeting here be delayed for a week, &quot;after which Iwill propose OPEC should meet with the IEA.&quot;   He maintained such a joint meeting would help oil-marketstability immediately and in the event a Middle East warbreaks out. &quot;If we do this, we will have used the best time-- a chance we should not ignore -- to bring aboutcooperation between consumers and producers,&quot; he said.   Neither the IEA nor the other oil ministers seemedenthusiastic about Mr. Aghazadeh's suggestion. A Parisofficial of the IEA was quoted by the Dow Jones InternationalPetroleum Report as saying that a meeting with OPEC &quot;is notin the cards.&quot;   Meanwhile, several other delegates, including those fromSaudi Arabia and Venezuela, were becoming irritated over theduration of the meeting. &quot;We are preparing our departure {bynoon today},&quot; said one delegate, &quot;and if the agreement isn'tsigned by then, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela will leave.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
