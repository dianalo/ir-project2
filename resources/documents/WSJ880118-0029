The suit, filed in the Supreme Court of Ontario, names as defendants the publishers of Toronto Life magazine, two of its editors and a free-lance writer who prepared the story, &quot;The Mysterious Reichmanns: The Untold Story.&quot; Toronto Life is owned by Toronto Life Publishing Co., a joint venture of Key Publishers Co. and CUC Ltd., all of Toronto. The Reichmanns are also suing the Toronto Sun, a daily newspaper, which printed a story about the magazine piece.    Officials of the Toronto Sun, a unit of Maclean Hunter Ltd., couldn't be reached.    The libel suit is an uncharacteristic move for the media-shy Reichmann family, and it involves one of the largest damage awards ever sought in Canada.    According to the suit, the Toronto Life story traces the Reichmanns' business activities in Austria, Hungary and the African city of Tangier before and during World War II. The suit says the story falsely indicates that the family's main business at that time was currency trading, not egg-processing and distribution.    In their 71-page filing, the Reichmanns say the article is &quot;false and malicious&quot; and defames the family and its business interests. The suit says the story &quot;will seriously impede their continued business relations&quot; with financial institutions, companies and individuals.    Marq de Villiers, the monthly magazine's editor and a defendant in the suit, said: &quot;We don't believe the piece was libelous.&quot; The magazine intends to file a statement of defense soon, he added. Elaine Dewar, author of the 40,000-word story, wouldn't comment.    Steven Sharpe, the Reichmanns' lawyer, couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
