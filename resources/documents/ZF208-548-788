 Eventually, as the number of usersincreases, buying another server is unavoidable.andP;  But if storage, not networkusers or traffic, is the problem, another alternative is available: opticaldisks.andM;Optical disks have been around in CD-ROM and Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) formfor a few years, but their usefulness over a network has been limited.andP;  Afterall, both are designed to store information that needs to be viewedrepeatedly, not information that needs to be changed repeatedly.andM;Until the recent advent of rewritable technology, optical disks were not aviable alternative for network storage.andP;  Novell (Provo, Utah) just recentlybegan certifying optical drives for use with NetWare, signaling that usersnow need a compact, durable medium to store large amounts of data.andM;Not only do optical disks offer increased capacity, they also introduce adimension of portability to the network.andP;  Optical disk cartridges areremovable, so one could be popped out of one network server and popped outanother server.andP;  The time and annoyance saved is immeasurable when setting upa new server, or even moving an existing network.andP;  Removability increasessecurity, since the disks can be popped out and locked away at night.andP;  Ofcourse, the portability could be seen a threat to security since the diskscan be secreted away in a pocket and carried off-site.andM;All optical disks manufactured are based on the ANSI standard, so a disk fromone vendor will work in the drive of another.andP;  The drives fit into thestandard 5.25-inch form factor, and research is underway for a 3.5-inchversion.andM;The Light at the EndandM;Optical disks differ from Winchester disks not in the way they storedata--both use magnetic particles--but in the way they record the data.andP;  Themethod of recording used by an erasable optical disk not only allows them topack more data onto a disk, but also makes them highly secure.andP;  Optical disksare impervious to head crashes, and since they are removable, they can belocked up every night to protect sensitive data.andM;A traditional Winchester disk is coated or plated with magnetic media.andP;  Datais laid down in tracks in concentric rings on the disk.andP;  The read-write headmoves across the surface of the disk like the needle on a turntable across arecord.andP;  The head doesn't actually touch the disk surface but glides justabove it, detecting and changing the polarity of the magnetic particles onthe surface.andM;When reading data, the head detects the polarization of a magnetic particleand interprets it as a bit of data.andP;  When writing to the disk, the headreorients the bit with a magnetic pulse.andP;  This naturally puts a limit on theamount of data a disk can contain.andP;  To pack more data onto a hard disk, themagnetic bits have to be placed closer together and the head has to comecloser to the disk surface to influence a smaller area.andP;  Eventually, no morespace is between the head and the disk.andM;Furthermore, the closer the head comes to the surface of a hard disk, themore susceptible the disk is to head crashes.andP;  If the head actually touchesthe disk surface, it can gouge out the media, corrupting or destroying data.andO;Head crashes also occur if the disk drive is jostled or dropped, which is whythe drives are not removable.andP;  Data can, of course, be corrupted in thepresence of a powerful magnet.andM;Like a traditional hard disk, an optical disk uses magnetic particles on thedisk to record data, influencing the particles with read-write heads.andO;Whereas a hard disk uses a magnetic flux alone to change the polarity of theparticles on the disk surface, optical disks, also called thermomagneticdisks, use a combination of heat, light, and magnetic pulses.andM;The magnetic particles on a hard disk are on the surface of the disk; themagnetic medium on an optical disk--the same media used on a hard disk--isembedded in the disk's center.andP;  The principal difference between the twodisks is in the amount of magnetism needed to change the magnetic field of agiven particle.andM;A rewritable optical disk uses a laser to impact the disk surface andreorient the magnetic particle.andP;  The head focuses on a tiny spot on the diskand heats it with a laser.andP;  As the temperature increases, the magneticparticle is less resistant to magnetic change.andP;  A weak magnetic force thencan change the particle's orientation.andM;Optical disks have tracks and sectors just like hard disks, although data onan optical disk is written in a spiral track as opposed to the concentrictracks on a hard disk.andP;  The magnetic particles initially are oriented in thesame direction.andP;  When a sector needs to be written, the laser is applied tothe particles, heating them to the Curie point, which is about 150[degrees]C.andP;  At that heat, the magnetic state of the particle can be changed by amagnetic bar beneath the disk.andP;  When the material cools, the particles holdtheir new orientation.andP;  To erase data, the particles are heated to the Curiepoint again, the magnetic bar is rolled over to change the magnetic domain,and the particles are returned to their original orientation.andM;Writing data to an optical disk can be done by three methods, depending onthe level of data integrity.andP;  Data can be written straight to the diskwithout erasing the sector first and without verifying the data afterwards.andO;Data can also be written after a preliminary erase pass, without a verifypass after the data has been written.andP;  The most thorough way of writing datais an erase pass, followed by a write pass, followed by a verify pass.andP;  Forexample, with low resolution graphics, it might not matter if you lose a bitor two, and data can be streamed onto the disk at the maximum possible datarate without verification.andP;  With a payroll application, however, it would becrucial to have the verification.andM;The data is read back by a beam of polarized light.andP;  Polarized light travelsinfinitely in a straight line unless it is influenced by a magnetic force.andO;The magnetic particles influence the reflection angle of the polarized beam,called the Kerr angle of rotation, and a photodetector detects the change inthe angle.andM;Although optical disks are far more resistant to physical data corruptionthan hard disks, data could be lost if the media has gaps.andP;  An optical diskis composed of several layers, and if there are gaps between the layers,moisture can build up and cause rust, which leads to data loss.andP;  It's best toask the optical disk manufacturer if its disk has gaps between the media.andM;Rewritable optical disks can do everything a hard disk, or any rewritabletechnology, can do.andP;  The two are similar in every way except the recordingmethod.andP;  Optical drives still spin, and read-write heads move over thespinning disk.andP;  Data still moves between the computer and the optical drivethrough a controller card.andM;Furthermore, anything running on any other rewritable technology will run onrewritable optical disks.andP;  Rewritable disks don't do anything special, theyjust do it at higher capacities, with increased invulnerability.andP;  &quot;It makesthe technology that much more valuable,&quot; says Stan Marder, president ofAdvanced Graphics Applications (AGA), a New York, N.Y.-based company thatmakes optical disk solutions for LANs.andM;The recording method gives rise to some important differences.andP;  Opticaltechnology makes rewritable disks immune to head crashes.andP;  The read-writeheads are nowhere near the disk surface, since the particles are influencedby lasers, not a generated magnetic field.andP;  Even if the head were to touchdown on the disk surface, the particles are embedded in the substrate andimmune to physical trauma.andP;  Nothing can alter the data but the fixed beam oflight at a certain temperature and density.andP;  This immunity makes the opticaldisks removable.andM;More importantly, the laser can pinpoint a much smaller, more preciselycontrolled area of the disk, allowing more data to be packed onto thesurface.andP;  This combination of security and capacity makes the optical diskthe perfect storage medium for network file servers, although, as with anynew technology, it has more skeptics than fanatics at first.andM;Light SpeedandM;The recurring complaint about optical disks is that they're too slow.andP;  Inthese days of 16 millisecond access time on Winchester disks, the opticaldisk drive's average 90 millisecond access time seems eternal.andP;  The firsthard disks were slow-moving dinosaurs, too.andM;Not that optical disks are really that slow in terms of access speed.andP;  Thefastest access speed of an optical disk is about 40 milliseconds, whereas amidrange hard disk has an access speed of around 60 milliseconds.andP;  Thetechnologies are not nearly so disparate as they seem.andP;  Optical disks aren'tinherently slow, they're just primitive.andP;  The laser diode on the read-writehead is large and, therefore, can't be moved so quickly, or it generates toomuch heat.andP;  The first hard disks had massive head assemblies that had to bemoved laboriously over the platters; now the heads are light and compact.andO;It's only a matter of time before the optical disk technology also advances.andM;Not that you should wait for better access times to purchase an optical diskdrive.andP;  First of all, the slower access speed can be compensated for.andO;Optical disk drives have mirrors that can be adjusted within 20 millisecondsin a five MB bandwidth.andP;  &quot;With Winchester drives, you tend to move the headsconstantly,&quot; says AGA's Marder.andP;  &quot;But with the mirrors on an optical disk,you could actually have an access time that's faster than that of a standardhard disk.&quot;andM;Depending on the file size and application, the lapse in access time mightnot even be noticeable.andP;  Anyway, access time may be a deceptive performancebenchmark, especially with the applications that optical disks are targetedtoward.andP;  &quot;There's a reluctance on the part of the end user who looksprimarily at the reported access time to buy an optical disk,&quot; says Marder.andO;&quot;However, users should be looking at how the optical drive works with theirin-house applications.andP;  If you're maintaining a mailing list with scatteredinformation in small files, a hard disk might perform better than an opticaldisk.andP;  If you have an imaging application, then the optical will almostdefinitely outperform a Winchester disk.&quot;andM;Craig, Berger, president of TransCom, a New York-based distributor of opticaldisk drives, agrees that optical disks are resisted initially, but notnecessarily because of the slower access speed.andP;  &quot;Speed hasn't really been anissue because of the enormous file sizes you deal with on an optical disk.andO;Access speed matters when you deal with files of 200 bytes, not 500KB,&quot; saysBerger.andP;  &quot;Unfortunately, we're trying to break into a niche market.andP;  At thiscapacity, there's still a lot of mainframe mentality.andP;  Optical disks areviewed as a novelty, not a need.&quot;andM;Users don't have to give up their hard disk completely if they want to takeadvantage of optical disk technology.andP;  A common implementation is to have anetwork server with a traditional hard disk drive as primary storage and anoptical drive as secondary storage.andP;  The hard disk acts almost like a buffer,storing files that are requested more often.andP;  Data not needed so often isshunted to the optical disk.andP;  The combination of the two storage types givesusers and faster hard disk access time when needed and the enormous capacityof the optical disk.andM;Again, users' hesitation with optical disks is a symptom of a young industry.andO;Typically, a reseller will leave an optical disk unit with a customer for atrial period.andP;  The customer tries everything, short of throwing the drive outa window, to make it fail.andP;  Reselles report that customers almost invariablypurchase the unit after putting it through every conceivable stress test.andO;The combination of capacity and invulnerability make optical disks seemirresistible.andM;Light CapacityandM;The enormous capacities of optical disks make them an appealing storagemedium for users with graphics-intensive applications.andP;  &quot;Optical disks workbest with applications that have large files,&quot; says Mark Anderson, manager ofRecordable Media Products at 3M (St.andP;  Paul, Minn.).andP;  &quot;They're probably a badidea for the typical spreadsheet, which has an average file size of 200KB.andO;But in the prepress business, a single four-color magazine page can have afile size of up to 30 or 40MB.andP;  AT that file size, one or two pages couldexceed the entire capacity of most hard disks.&quot;andM;Any application needing the combination of capacity, random access, andremovability is ideal for optical disks.andP;  A major mainframe and LANmanufacturer uses optical dicks to store millions of lines of source code andships them between development sites.andP;  The disks are also popular in largegovernment installations with complex databases in which individual recordsizes are large.andP;  Optical disks are growing more popular in universities forstoring data coming off a satellite.andM;For now, rewritable optical disks are aimed mainly at graphics-basedapplications or applications with unusually large files.andP;  However, PetePassaretti, national manager of business development at Sony (New York, N.Y.)andO;who carries around his &quot;file cabinet&quot; on an optical disk, disagrees thattheir usefulness is limited to applications with large file sizes.andP;  &quot;I canpop the cartridge out of the drive in my office, go on the road, and pop itinto another system; I have all the information I need right there.andP;  They aredefinely useful in a regular office situation.&quot;andM;Nor are optical disks limited to use with PC LANs.andP;  One of the beauties ofoptica disk technology is that all the manufacturers comply to the ISO andANSI standards.andP;  Optical disks are, like regular hard disks, compatible withMacintoshes, as long as the drive has a Small Computer System Interface(SCSI) port.andP;  Alphatronix (Research Triangle Park, N.C.), MicroTech (EastHaven, Conn., and Racet (Brea, Calif.) are among several companies that makeoptical disk storage for the Macintosh.andM;Light Disks, More FilingandM;Keep in mind that although optical disks are touted as having storagecapacities of 650MB, that's counting both sides of the disk.andP;  In actuality,the online access capacity in a single disk drive is 325M bytes.andP;  To accessthe other 325MB, the disk must be removed and turned over.andP;  That is less thanconvenient, especially for LANs.andM;The fact that the disks can be removed and turned over has given rise to theniftiest storage devise yet: the optical disk jukebox.andP;  Not only does thejukebox solve the problem of how to get to the other side of the disk withoutremoving it, it increases the online capacity enormously.andP;  Jukeboxes havebeen around for CD-ROMs and WORM drives for a while, but their usefulnesswith rewritable drives is immeasurable.andM;A jukebox consists of one or more drives and several optical disk platters.andO;The mechanism in the jukebox takes a few seconds to go out, select a disk,turn it over if need be, and insert it in the drive.andP;  AGA, for example,reports that its rewritable optical disk jukebox has a worst-case access timeof 2.5 seconds, largely due, says Marder, to the management software anddevice drivers the company has written.andP;  Two and a half seconds may seem likea long time to wait, but consider that with 56 platters in one jukebox, youhave 36GB online.andP;  The tradeoff between speed and storage may be worthwhile.andM;Hewlett-Packard (San Diego, Calif.) has a rewritable optical disk &quot;library&quot;and a standalone optical disk subsystem.andP;  The optical disk library holds 32platters, with a full library capacity of over 20GB.andP;  The unit has two diskdrives and averages about seven seconds for a disk change.andP;  Hewlett-Packard'sjukebox is priced at $29,900 and the stand alone system is $6,190, with theoptical disk cartridges priced at $249.andM;The Worms TurnsandM;Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) drives can also be useful in networkingapplications although generally they're considered a useful alternative totape backup, since all the changes to any given file are permanentlyrecorded.andP;  The time-stamped updates can also be invaluable in applicationswhere each transaction needs to be tracked, such as in banking or accounting.andM;Some WORM drives use the same technology as rewritable optical disks, heatingmagnetic particles to a temperature at which they can be reoriented easily,but the magnetic medium used won't allow itself to be changed more than once.andO;Thus, the changes are burned onto the disk.andP;  Files can be updated, with eachchange time-stamped so that a file's ongoing audit trail is kept permanentlyon a virtually indestructible disk.andM;Syntrex (Eatontown, N.J.) makes a network storage and retrieval system basedon a WORM drive.andP;  The menu-driven front end interfaces to any DOS applicationand lets users create a filing system that identifies the document bysubject, author, document type, date, and keywords.andP;  These documents arestored on a WORM drive, either standalone or on the company's Cygnet Series5000 jukebox.andP;  The jukebox supports up to 25 disks, providing 20GB of storagewith a disk change time of four seconds.andM;The OptiStar Interface kits from Corel (Ont., Canada) allow a WORM drive tobe used as a standard Novell file server drives.andP;  The user never knows thatthe WORM drive is writing a new version of the file each time it's saved.andP;  Inlight of the new erasable technology, software that writes to a permanentdisk isn't needed as much, but users who invested in WORM drives and aren'tready to commit to rewritable disks might find it helpful.andM;The company also makes WORM disk subsystems.andP;  The OptiStar Disk Interface kitranges in price from $298 to $1,295, depending on the operating systemthey're used with and how many users they're supporting.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
