Jackson.    Kenner Parker earlier rejected a price of $41 a share, and after some legal wrangling, New World commenced a tender offer Wednesday.    Yesterday, Kenner Parker executives declined to comment on the letter, which was made public after the markets closed.    Kenner Parker closed at $45.50, down 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Asked if the letter meant New World plans to raise its bid, which has an indicated value of $430 million, a company spokesman said only that &quot;our offer is not cast in concrete.&quot;    New World, an entertainment company that is making the bid through its Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. unit, added in the letter that its executives would like to meet with those of Kenner Parker. New World said it also is seeking information from the Beverly, Mass., toy maker that might not be public but that would help New World &quot;present our best possible proposal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
