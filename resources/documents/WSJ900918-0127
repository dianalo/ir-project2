You mightthink a wood-products executive whose office looks out towardthis supply lode would be delighted.   Not Walter Minnick. The president/CEO of TJ International(formerly Trus Joist) thinks those yields are uneconomic. Hesays some timber sales in the region are subsidized 10 to 1,even 20 to 1, by taxpayers. The U.S. Forest Service buildsroads for loggers and other users.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Minnick is not cut from the timber-industry mold. Aneconomics graduate of studious Whitman College near hisboyhood home in eastern Washington, he holds law and businessdegrees from Harvard. And he is a member of the WildernessSociety and the Idaho Conservation League, both of which hecredits with an economic approach to environmentalism.   Greens still lose most battles in this part of thecountry. Resource industries hold sway, and with costs bornenationwide, the politics favor logging even in this rough,dry terrain. &quot;The community enjoys jobs and prosperity,&quot; Mr.Minnick explains. &quot;It's no different from any othersubsidized local industry.&quot; Forest Service land accounts forabout half the intermountain West's timber, and Montana andIdaho make up 20% of the total national-forest harvest.   In general, U.S. forestry companies rely on public landsfor the bulk of their timber supply. Add to that thesentiment in logging towns and you get a consensus forcutting, at least under Republican, pro-businessadministrations.   But that's changing and his industry had better be readyto make more out of less, Mr. Minnick says. He toldsecurities analysts in June that the Forest Service is &quot;aboutto be greened.&quot; A caucus within the agency, he elaborates, isemerging to favor &quot;non-consumptive uses.&quot; A Forest Servicebiologist's report calling for halving the logging on publiclands in the Northwest to spare the spotted owl's &quot;oldgrowth&quot; habitat is the basis for wrangling within the Bushadministration currently. A Bush half step risks overrulingby the courts; last week, for instance, a U.S. circuit courtplanted a legal sapling by blocking a cut that threatened nospecies in particular but rather a &quot;biological corridor&quot;between two wilderness areas.   Politically, too, the ground may shift against theindustry in the intermountain West just as it has along thePacific Coast. Boise, for example, is attracting white-collargrowth with its cleanliness, low crime and taxes, and accessto recreation.   Mr. Minnick has been nudging the process along. Thissummer he sought to impress on a Republican congressionalhopeful just how subsidized the region's timber sales are.&quot;Hopefully, this information will be useful to you and otherfree-enterprise, fiscal conservatives as you shape yourcampaigns,&quot; he closed a letter.   If Mr. Minnick doesn't go along with the &quot;commodityideology&quot; toward natural resources that he says wasrepresentative of the Reagan years -- timber yields innational forests reached a historical peak in 1987 -- neitherdoes he support curbing exports of raw logs, a subissue ofthe spotted-owl/old-growth forest fight. This cause isspearheaded by Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio and GOP Sen.Robert Packwood, both of Oregon, who are aligned with thegreens and with U.S. millers pressed by foreign competition.   Here again, Mr. Minnick cites foresters' myopia. Alog-export ban, with the Bush administration's assent, hasnow spread from harvests on federal land to most stateforests as well. His industry generally backed the new law,he says -- &quot;that's why it passed.&quot; Domestic companies(including TJ International) both gain and lose by therestriction, and see it heading off a similar ban beingapplied to private lands, but Mr. Minnick thinks the wholegambit is an inappropriate cover for failure to keep pacewith Japan at maximizing use of scarce resources in advancedmills.   By toying with trade restrictions, Mr. Minnick said to theanalysts, the industry risks becoming &quot;a fat boy sitting on afence just waiting to be knocked flat,&quot; like autos and steel.   In an interview, the avowed free trader argues, &quot;Everytime you do something protectionist, you strengthen theprotectionists on the other side.&quot; He observes that the U.S.often does that: It bans foreign-flag intracoastal shipping,curbs dozens of import categories and, analogous to thetimber issue, restricts the export of Alaskan oil.   Yet TJ International was part of an industry petition tohave Japan cited as a violator of the &quot;Super 301&quot; trade lawfor its barriers to American wood products. Mr. Minnicksquares this by saying that effective trade liberalizationshould include a bit of bluster to get others to lower theirwalls.   The Super 301 petition resulted in the U.S. negotiating areduction in Japan's tariffs on laminated veneer lumber (TJ'smainstay, which the boss calls the &quot;highest-tech wood producton the market&quot;) to 3.9% from 20%. No sanctions were imposed.Mr. Minnick says the trade law has been &quot;used rather deftlyby an administration that is basically pro-free trade.&quot;   As a manufacturer of composite products, TJ Internationalis better positioned than many to prosper in a world ofscarcer materials. So, Mr. Minnick has an interest in hissupply pronouncements. But he says old-growth logs areimportant to TJ, too -- they provide critical strength to thewood-frame home construction that, along with customized woodwindows, is its business. It may have to &quot;reconfigure&quot;output, even as it scrambles along with the rest of the U.S.industry to shift operations to the timberlands of theSoutheast.   Mr. Minnick, 48 this week, sees the downturn in Northwestlogging as inevitable. Rapid cutting of private lands in the1950s and '60s moved on to public lands in the '70s and '80s.(In California, private harvests are still the rage as threeballot measures to limit logging approach in November.) Mr.Minnick says a dawning deficiency of West Coast timber isunlikely to be made up until the &quot;second-growth&quot; plantings onthe private lands are ready in nearly 20 years. In theRockies belt, the cut is about what it was in 1970, but withimproved transport options its value as a replacement sourcefor timber grows.   Mr. Minnick doesn't want the stuff below cost, courtesy ofUncle Sam. It isn't easy being big-minded in his businessright now: Though TJ International, above $350 million inannual sales, aspires to make the Fortune 500, its income hasbeen off the past two years and the housing slump only getsworse. But the CEO is undaunted. Of the whole industry, hesays, &quot;The less government is involved, the stronger we willbe long term.&quot;   Does he really mean that? No breaks at the sales end,either? Other than housing vouchers for the poor, yes, hesays. And no concocted lending institutions, like thethrifts. TJ's bread and butter is the upscale new home, amarket whose foundation is the tax-deductible mortgage. Whatabout that? It's a subsidy, he concedes, and as part of anoverall addressing of federal largess, he'll put it on thetable, as they say in D.C. Few guys in the building businesswill go as far with a level.</TEXT></DOC>
