Their numbers andvigor will bring renewed national attention to thelegislative battle over abortion while continuing to obscurethe fact that the most effective instrument we pro-lifershave has nothing to do with changing the law.   That instrument is the Crisis Pregnancy Center, or CPC.Quietly, CPCs have been springing up all over the U.S.,offering tangible forms of assistance -- clothing, shelter,and an extensive referral network -- to pregnant women whootherwise might have abortions. The number of CPCs affiliatedwith the Christian Action Council, one of the largestorganizations of CPCs, has risen from 200 in 1985 to morethan 450 today. Hundreds more are connected with Catholicchurches.</LP><TEXT>   The work of the CPCs is barely noticed, since we toil inthe confidential environment of one-to-one counseling. Wedon't get the publicity regularly afforded to highly visiblepro-life activities like Operation Rescue. As a result, manystill have the impression that there are no pro-liferswilling to give practical assistance to mothers who decide tokeep their babies or put them up for adoption.   But Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) did the CPC network a favorin October -- albeit unintentionally. His one-sided attack onCPCs that advertise &quot;abortion information&quot; (no pro-liferswere invited to testify at his subcommittee hearings) putCPCs in the national headlines for the first time. Thanks toRep. Wyden, a few more Americans know what CPCs are and whatwe are doing. Now let me give you a few reasons why youshould care:   -- We generate private support for essential societalvalues. The current rash of deep cuts in welfare funding, asstate after state grapples with severe budget strains,threatens to expand further the social epidemic ofinadequately prepared parents and neglected children. Incontrast, CPCs provide caring relationships with a personaltouch, in addition to free clothing and other baby items, tohelp the mother and child get off on the right foot. Thoserelationships continue well beyond the mother's delivery day.   &quot;Crisis Pregnancy Centers are primarily staffed byvolunteers and usually one underpaid staff person,&quot; saysThomas Glessner, president of the Christian Action Council.&quot;They are funded totally by private donations and . . . thecommitted men and women who staff these centers are motivatedout of love and concern for both the woman in crisis and herbaby.&quot;   -- We have no hidden agenda. Christian Action Councilcenters never indicate or imply that we perform abortions. Itis our policy not to advertise under &quot;Abortion&quot; in the phonebook, although some independent centers have done so when thephone company declined to create a separate &quot;AbortionAlternatives&quot; category.   And we are extremely careful about our methods ofcounseling. Although we believe a human life is at stake inevery abortion decision, we also have known, long before Rep.Wyden's hearings, that our opponents are hungry for evidencethat we brutalize already traumatized pregnant women with&quot;you'd better not murder your baby&quot; rhetoric.   Here's a typical example of how we do behave. In one caseat one of our centers, a brand-new volunteer met with amarried couple considering an abortion. She provided themwith material on fetal development and noted that the fetusinvolved was already mature enough to have visiblefingerprints. After the meeting, she hoped and prayed thatthe mother would conclude that her baby deserved to live.   But when her follow-up call brought the grim response of&quot;We've made an appointment for an abortion,&quot; the volunteerpatiently explained that the CPC also offers post-abortioncounseling and that the couple would always be welcome tocome back. &quot;We want you to know that we still care aboutyou,&quot; she concluded.   Of course, there are many times, as in this case, when weare deeply saddened by a decision that a client makes andfeel that she doesn't really understand what she is doing.But we don't judge her. Brandy, a 17-year-old client in oneof our centers, said, &quot;I wanted them to tell me what to do,but they wouldn't. They told me about all of the alternativesand helped me make a list of the pros and cons of each.&quot;Brandy decided to carry her baby to term and is still intouch with the center.   The CPCs are committed to doing what it takes to show thatour concern for women is unselfish, unmanipulative andunconditional. The Christian Action Council's statement ofprinciples, which must be agreed to by all its affiliates,states in part, &quot;The CPC denounces any form of deception inits corporate advertising or individual conversations withclients.&quot;   -- We want to help bridge one of this nation's mostdivisive issues. We share the concern of many nationalleaders that the abortion debate keeps us from moving on toother pressing issues. Of course, that does not mean we areready to drop this issue, for we believe that any societythat permits its commitment to the sanctity of life to erodeis on the way to disintegration. But we also believe that ifanyone is offering real options to pregnant women -- optionsof the type upon which a broad social consensus can be built-- it is us.   While the other side of the debate talks a lot aboutchoice, the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL),for example, does not offer material assistance, housing, orother support to enable a woman in crisis to choose life forher baby. Likewise, the National Organization for Women issilent when it comes to generating support services for womenwho want to carry their babies to term. Instead, these twoorganizations emphasize and promote one choice and one choiceonly for a woman in crisis -- abortion. We believe that themore people work with us, and the more women we are able toserve, the less often abortion will appear to be the bestchoice for women with crisis pregnancies.   If the U.S. can ever resolve its abortion wars peacefully,there is no better place to do so than at the doorstep of aCPC.   ---   Ms. Diemert is the president of the Greater PittsburghCoalition of Crisis Pregnancy Centers, an affiliate of theChristian Action Council.</TEXT></DOC>
