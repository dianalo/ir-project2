He'll be back. They allkeep coming back. A decade from now promoters will be wheeling Leonard andThomas Hearns into the arena in wheelchairs and dumping them through theropes.;    This is ridiculous. Did you see the Leonard-Terry Norris fight theother night? Listen, if I wanted to witness someone past his prime gettingbeat up by a younger person, I'd simply walk down the street late at nightwith a couple of hundred-dollar bills hanging out of my pocket.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SUGAR RAY, PLEASE DON'T TRY IT AGAIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Off the Wall  </MEMO><TEXT>     We can only hope Leonard schedules his next 12-rounder against someone alittle closer to his own skill level. Such as, say, the ashes of the lateRocky Graziano (which would be installed as a 2-to-1 pre-fight favorite).;   Note: Such criticisms do not apply to old George Foreman, the past and futureheavyweight champ and the hero to anyone who ever had one too manycheeseburgers. Foreman started from scratch on his comeback trail, fightingcastoffs and palookas. He has earned his way back to the top, and to a titleshot.; Tom Powers,; Knight-Ridder News Service;  FOR VITALE FANS ONLY;    Ifyou can't get enough of an obnoxious loudmouth screaming at you for ahalf-hour, ESPN has just the answer in its new 35-minute home video &quot;Time Out,Baby, Dick Vitale's College Hoop Superstars.&quot; He'll display his all-time&quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; players and the all-time &quot;Dipsy-doo Dunka-roos&quot; and &quot;Slam BamJammers.&quot; Not to mention his &quot;Rock Dish Supreme&quot; (outstanding passes) and&quot;Rejectors&quot; (shot blockers). It might not be bad if you begin the video bydepressing the &quot;mute&quot; button.;  KIDS, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME;    At firstglance, Lane Spina of Reno doesn't appear to be exhibiting gold-medal formduring competition in Lake Placid, N.Y., this week. However, Spina did win agold medal in the event -- world championship freestyle men's ballet. We'restill awaiting results from the synchronized snowball toss.;  THIS CELTICSDRAFT PICK IS FLYING HIGH ACROSS THE ATLANTIC;    The Boston Celtics drafted aBird and a Byrd in 1979, and both have become stars in different ways.;   Larry Bird, of course, became an NBA superstar. Alton Byrd took his game toEngland, where as point guard for the English national team, he's helped raisethe level of basketball in that country.;    The 5-foot-9 Byrd, a native ofSan Francisco, was drafted in the 10th round by the Celtics out of Columbiabut failed to make the team. He headed for London, hoping for someinternational business experience. Soon he was playing basketball again.;   &quot;When I was growing up in San Francisco, if you had said to me that in 1991I'd be English, living in London and married to an Englishwoman, I would havesaid you've got to have your head examined,&quot; he said.;  'Guys weren't in sync.It was gone. In fact, the whole kitchen sink was gone. Everything was gone.'-- Miami guard Sherman Douglas after the Heat lost 94-78 to Cleveland onTuesday  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Information for this column was compiled from Mercury News wire services.  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910214  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  524  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 14, 199100045231,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
