<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0678 </DOCNO><TEXT>The radiative component of the thermal conductivity is expressed in termsof a spectral distribution and a frequency dependent photon attenuationlength. This length is limited by specimen thickness, by absorption andby scattering. This treatment disregards absorption. The radiative transferspectrum can have two peaks in the case of fibers and particles: a thermalpeak and a peak at low frequencies. In those cases the radiative componentdeparts strongly from a cubic temperature dependence. In the case offoams, there is only one peak, the thermal peak, and departures fromcubic variation are smaller. The radiative component is calculated forsome representative cases of fibers and foams. Deterioration of the insulatingquality of foams could be caused not only by air infiltration but bysurface-tension driven thinning of walls. 7 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
