With the U.S. economy faltering, and short-term U.S.interest rates well below those in Europe, the dollar stillis being shunned by many investors.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The downtrend is still intact,&quot; says ChristopherBourdain, a foreign exchange adviser at Credit Suisse in NewYork. He and other foreign exchange specialists say thedollar will probably run into resistance quickly if itstrengthens in the next few days.   In late trading here Friday, the dollar was quoted at1.6475 marks and 130.40 yen, slightly higher than 1.6415marks and 129.88 yen late Thursday. The pound fell to $1.7640from $1.7710.   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 130.33yen, up slightly from Tokyo's close Friday of 130.23 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6482 marks, upfrom 1.6443 marks at Friday's close.   Late last week, the dollar regained a little of what ithad lost during the recent slide. Because of a number of weakU.S. economic reports and the Federal Reserve's creditrelaxation in the last two weeks, the dollar has fallensharply from a level of around 1.70 marks a month ago.Thursday's intraday low of 1.6260 marks was the dollar'sweakest level since March 22.   Dollar trading may be very volatile this week as severalU.S. economic statistics are reported. Aside from data onproducer prices and consumer prices, the most recent retailsales and industrial production figures will be released.   Economists generally don't expect much change in the levelof U.S. inflation. But they say the retail sales andindustrial production reports are likely to indicate thateconomic growth remains slow. Sales probably climbed 0.1%last month after rising 0.7% in September, while industrialproduction was probably unchanged after increasing 0.1%, someeconomists say. The sales data will be reported Thursday andthe industrial output figures on Friday.   Sentiment about the dollar will be bearish as long asthere is a &quot;sad economic picture&quot; in the U.S., says Mr.Bourdain.   Even though the U.S. economy is expected to remain weakfor some time, not everyone is bearish about the dollar.   Judging from the dollar's slight rise late last week,market participants who sold the dollar heavily are &quot;startingto change their minds&quot; about the U.S. currency, says JeromeCamblain, manager of currency options trading at ParibasCapital Markets Group in New York. If the dollar remainsabove a technical support level at 1.6260 marks, traders maynudge it above resistance around 1.6500 marks, he says.   Mr. Camblain says the dollar has the potential to risebecause interest rates in Europe seem poised to move lower. Arate decline in Europe would make yields in the U.S. creditmarkets more attractive to foreign investors.   Three-month Eurodollar deposits currently yield 5%,substantially less than 9.3% for equivalent mark deposits and10.3% for equivalent pound deposits.   With longer maturities, the differences are so wide,however. That is because long-term U.S. rates haven'tdeclined much even though the Fed has lowered short-termrates sharply to foster economic growth.   The U.S. Treasury's newly auctioned 10-year notes, the 71/2s of 2001, currently yield 7.4%. Ten-year governmentissues in Germany and Britain currently yield 8.3% and 9.6%,respectively.   While German rates aren't expected to declinesubstantially any time soon, Bundesbank President HelmutSchlesinger indicated in a newspaper interview Friday thatrates may have peaked for now. Mr. Schlesinger told theTimes, a London daily, that he is &quot;not so sure&quot; that theBundesbank will raise its discount rate again soon.   In August, the discount rate was raised a full percentagepoint to the current 7.5% when the Bundesbank tightenedaggressively to combat inflation in Germany. The discountrate is the least expensive form of bank refinancing inGermany.   The dollar selling that occurred in the past few weeks wasdriven, in part, by speculation that the Bundesbank wasgetting prepared to raise its discount rate again. Mr.Schlesinger's remarks helped the dollar strengthen againstthe mark Friday, traders say.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $354.20 an ounce, up 50 cents.   In Hong Kong on Monday, gold was quoted at $354.35 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
