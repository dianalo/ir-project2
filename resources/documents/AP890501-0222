The Christian Pages, for example, looks like a slimmer versionof the commercial advertising directories published by the regionalphone companies and other publishers. It follows the usual formatof yellow newsprint and black-and-red type.   ``The Christian Pages directory is designed to assist born-againChristians in locating members of the Body of Christ should youdesire to do business with one another,'' the guide's introductionsays.   The welcome invokes Galatians 6:10, a New Testament verse thatreads: ``As we therefore have opportunity, let us do good unto allmen, especially those who are of the household of faith.''   ``There's definitely a demand and a need for it,'' said BobHover, who has published the 75,000-circulation phone book for 300Michigan churches since 1980. ``For me, this is a ministry. It's away for me to serve the Lord and be a blessing to the Christiancommunity.''   Advertisers are required to sign a statement of faith in Christ,Hover said. Business owners professing other faiths are refusedspace.   ``Anybody who's truly a Christian obviously has very highstandards,'' he said, adding that recent scandals involvingevangelists haven't hurt business. ``There's an advantage to doingbusiness with a person who truly believes.''   But others see such directories as a way of shutting out thosewho aren't seen as believers.   ``There's no doubt that anything that's an exclusive listing isdivisive to the public,'' said Elliot Wright, senior vice presidentfor programs at the National Conference of Christians and Jews inNew York. ``I happen to be a Methodist and we put out a catalogue.But it's stuff that Methodist churches need.   ``Other than those kinds of approaches, our position is it'sjust not a neighborly thing to do.''   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith views Hover's workmore as a curse than a blessing, said Jill Kahn, assistant legalaffairs director at the Jewish group's Washington, D.C.,headquarters.   ``We think that simply by advertising in that grouping, they'resending a very powerful `Buy Christian' message _ and that we findunacceptable,'' she said.   A Christian directory in Los Angeles went bankrupt in 1977 aftera judge awarded damages to two Jewish businessmen who sued afterbeing denied advertising space, Kahn said.   That guide violated California's civil rights act, which bansreligious-based trade conspiracies, Kahn said. Michigan and mostother states lack such specific laws, she said.   Owners of some Jewish business directories have been warnedagainst overstepping their bounds, Kahn said. Most advertise onlyitems used in religious observances.   Richard Lobenthal, the Anti-Defamation League's Michigandirector, said he objects to ``an innuendo in this sort ofadvertising that nobody is honest or reputable unless they areborn-again Christians.''   ``Some of the solicitations are absurd,'' Lobenthal said. ``Noone's ever been able to persuade me that there's anything religiousabout a tune-up.''   The National Council of Churches hasn't grappled with the issueof religious business directories, said Carol Fouke, a spokeswomanfor the New York-based group.   Baltimore-based Shepherd's Guide, which publishes Christiandirectories from Maine to Florida, is the Christian Pages' latestcompetition in the battle for believers' profits.   Other religious organizations target buyers instead of sellers.Michigan-based Christian Consumers Association promises its 14,000members ``Christian buying power.''   Churches and families pay $586 for a 20-year membership,President Jerry Amster said. In exchange, the organization huntsfor the lowest price on everything from mattresses to marriagecounseling.   ``As a group, we can negotiate better prices,'' Amster said. ``Ithink it's very demeaning for a minister to go into a furnitureshowroom and haggle.''   In 1988, the group served as a go-between for more than $6million worth of transactions, he said.   ``We're treated differently,'' Amster said. ``It's not becausewe're Christians. It's because we spend $6 million a year.''</TEXT></DOC>
