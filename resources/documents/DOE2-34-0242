We have measuredthe evaporation of gallium and arsenic through the contact overlayerswhich results from the decomposition of the GaAs substrate. These decompositionmeasurements have been correlated with the Schottky barrier behavioras determined from forward-bias current-voltage characteristics and selectedcapacitance-voltage measurements. The high-temperature stability againstdecomposition and electrical degradation was superior for Ta{sub 5} Si{sub3} contacts relative to TaSi{sub 2} contacts. We observed for both contactcompositions that the onset temperature for decomposition of GaAs wasslightly lower than the maximum temperature for electrical stability.Thus, we found that in some cases substantial decomposition occurredwith no effect on the current-voltage characteristics. For example, Ta{sub5} Si{sub 3} contacts maintained a stable barrier height of 0.78 eV through10 s RTP treatments up to 900 {sup 0}C, in spite of decomposition ofat least ten equivalent monolayers of GaAs.</TEXT></DOC>
