Watkins is balking ata request by a federal judge that he testify on what the governmentagreed to in settling a class-action lawsuit over pollution from anuclear weapons plant.   Watkins didn't explicitly say he would refuse to appear in thecourt of U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnati, butindicated he would try to avoid it.   ``My lawyers tell me that it's not essential, that I am not boundby law to comply with that thing,'' Watkins said in a meeting Fridaywith reporters in his office.   ``It's very difficult for me to be put in that position _ todemand my presence under these circumstances.''   The suit was brought by 14,000 people who live near the Fernald,Ohio, weapons plant. The residents allege they suffered emotionaldistress and diminished property values as a result of uranium dustreleases from the plant.   They contend they still have the right to sue for contaminationcleanup costs, but the department, which owns the plant, says theproposed settlement is intended to preclude any further suits overcleanup.   The plant, known as the Feed Materials Production Center, is 18miles from Cincinnati.   Spiegel, who must approve the proposed settlement, said Wednesdayhe wanted Watkins to testify under oath on his understanding of whatthe settlement entailed.   Stanley Chesley, lawyer for the residents, said Watkins wasrunning the risk of being formally ordered to testify.   ``Adm. Watkins is picking a fight with the wrong judge,'' Chesleysaid.   In a related matter, Watkins said he would present to PresidentBush within two weeks a plan for restoring the nation's capabilityto produce a gas needed to make nuclear warheads.   The plan will include a recommendation that three active butidled military reactors in South Carolina be restarted and run foranother 15 years to ensure a supply of tritium, a radioactive gasused to boost warheads' explosive power.   Watkins provided no details of the plan, but he has said he wouldlike the first of the Savannah River reactors, near Aiken, S.C., tobe operating by early next year. All three have been under repairfor more than one year, leaving the Pentagon with a diminishingstockpile of materials for warhead production.   Watkins also said he would tell Bush the Savannah River reactorsshould not be operated beyond 2005 because of uncertainty aboutaging problems.   ``Not one of us would sign on a piece of paper that it's smart totake those aging reactors beyond that point,'' he said. ``There arejust too many unknowns.''   Watkins said Congress should move quickly to approve thefinancing for development and construction of two newtritium-producing reactors _ one at Savannah River and one in Idaho_ to ensure a continued supply beyond the 1990s. The department hassaid the plants can be built in 10 years for $6.8 billion.   ``The fragility of the antique reactors at Savannah River isgoing to be hanging over our heads like the Sword of Damocles untilthe year 2005,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
