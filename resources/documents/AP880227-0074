WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gary Hart today said he planned to stay in theDemocratic presidential race, despite his poor showings so far atthe polls, as he and his rivals for the nomination prepared todebate one another again.   Meanwhile, Republican George Bush turned up the heat on PatRobertson for making ``ridiculous'' allegations about him.   Questions had arisen over wehther Hart was planning to call anend to his campaign, but the former Colorado senator said heplanned to continue looking for votes in the South.   Hart told a news conference that he would stay in the racebecause ``the Democratic Party must have a voice for reform andchange.''   The Democrats were meeting in a debate in Atlanta as they pointtoward the Super Tuesday primaries across the South and elsewherethat will decide more than one-third of the nominating delegatesand propel at least some of the candidates on to the next round inbig industrial states.   Sen. Paul Simon, whose campaign is on the ropes and isn't activein the 20 Southern and other states voting March 8, predicted:``You're going to have as a result of Super Tuesday a very mixedresult with Jesse Jackson likely getting more delgates than anyoneelse.''   Simon told a news conference in Atlanta that he would continueto campaign until the March 15 primary in Illinois, his home state,where he said he expects to be the leading Democratic vote-getter,followed by Jackson.   Some of the Democratic candidates planned to participate in a1{-mile march today through downtown Atlanta to call attention tothe problem of homelessness.   Republicans in Maine, meanwhile, began a series of weekendcaucuses with supporters of Bush and chief rival Bob Dole engagedin an alliance to stop Robertson. Maine Democrats hold theircaucuses Sunday, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis expectedto win the New England state.   There was little mention of the internal bickering betweenDukakis, Richard Gephardt and Albert Gore Jr. as they and theirother rivals spoke Friday evening before a huge Georgia stateDemocratic Party dinner. They attacked the Reagan administration asone of greed and complacency while each repeated his own campaignthemes.   Dukakis, who has tried to remain above the exchanges of theother Democrats even as he suggests he may join it, made only aveiled reference to attacks from Gephardt earlier this week.   ``I hope we will be a party that has learned the lessons ofdivision,'' Dukakis said. ``Let's make 1988 a year for the promiseof opportunity, not the politics of resentment.''   National Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk urged the candidates atthe start of the dinner not to engage in more bickering, cautioningthat the American people ``don't want name-calling.''   While the Democrats talked, Vice President Bush was ensconsed ina suite at a posh Atlanta hotel just across the street from theDemocrats' gala, taking a respite from two days of stumping inSouth Carolina.   He again blasted Robertson upon arriving in Atlanta, saying theformer television evangelist should offer proof to support hisvarious claims _ that Bush forces timed the embarrassingsex-scandal disclosures of another TV evangelist, Jimmy Swaggart,and that the Bush camp was engaged in ``sleazy'' politics and``dirty tricks'' against him.   ``The charge is ridiculous,'' Bush said. ``It's not the Americanway to make unsubstantiated charges. It sounds like ... some kindof elementary level politics.''   Campaigning earlier in South Carolina, the state Robertson haspicked for his showdown with Bush, the vice president recountedRobertson's charges and demanded of each, ``prove it.'' He alsosaid Robertson was ``scaring the American people'' by suggestingnuclear missiles are in Cuba.   Dole, meantime, was campaigning in Texas where he picked up theendorsement of former Gov. John Connally, saying it would help himin the largest Super Tuesday state.   Robertson also campaigned in Texas, saying at a private churchacademy that he wanted ``to see America ... go back to our faith inGod.''   The Republican candidates were meeting in a debate in AtlantaSunday afternoon, also pointing toward the GOP Super Tuesdayprimaries.   In other campaign activity:   _ Dukakis gently criticized Gephardt while campaigning in Texasearlier Friday, saying President Reagan's 1981 tax cut thatGephardt voted for was ``one of the biggest mistakes in recentAmerican history.'' He didn't name his rival.   _ Gephardt kept up his theme that America is in an economicdecline and lashed out at Eastern Airlines in Miami as an exampleof a company more interested in ``quick paper profits'' than itsemployees. Eastern has sustained mammoth financial losses.   _ Jackson accused the U.S. government and CIA of being ``anaccomplice'' to Panama military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.He said U.S. backing for Noriega, who has been indicted on U.S.drug charges, is an example of the failure of U.S. foreign policyto take the drug threat seriously.   _ Bush said Noriega ``should go and in my view he will go.'' Hesaid he did not rule out use of military force to protect U.S.interests in Panama.   _ Republican Jack Kemp, who must do well on Super Tuesday tokeep his White House hopes alive, campaigned in South Carolina andsaid Noriega ``should be ousted.''   _ With all political eyes on Super Tuesday, Reagan got in theact by meeting with Republican state chairmen from the South, whotold him they hope to attract conservative Democrats to their ranksin the Southern presidential primaries.</TEXT></DOC>
