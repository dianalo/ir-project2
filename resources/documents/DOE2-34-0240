The radioactive /sup 111/In-/sup 111/Cdtracers are incorporated in the metallic indium used as starting materialfor crystal growth. Cu/sub 1-//sub x/In/sub 1+//sub x/S{sub 2} sampleswith varying Cu:In ratio (x = 0.0, 0.03, 0.07, 0.10) were prepared andcharacterized by PAC's. The stoichiometric sample (x = 0.0) shows cubicsymmetry of the In site without tetragonal distortion. For all sampleswith In excess the signals of metallic In (v/sub Q/{sub 1} = e{sup 2}qQ/h= 18 MHz, eta{sub 1} = 0) and InS (v/sub Q/{sub 2} = 233 MHz, eta{sub2} = 0.15) appear. Consequently, a new line in the Gibb's phase triangleof the Cu-In-S system is determined. The fractions of the In and InSphases as a function of In excess are analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
