(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sounding confident of a historic victory inthe governor's race, Democrat L. Douglas Wilder on Sunday workedVirginia's coal territory seeking the same boost that gave him hisfirst statewide office four years ago.   Republican J. Marshall Coleman campaigned in the northernShenandoah Valley and in Colonial Heights near Richmond, tellingsupporters the election is ``not in the bag'' despite Wilder'sconsistent lead in the polls.   Wilder, who is trying to become the nation's first elected blackgovernor, led Coleman by 9 percentage points in a RichmondTimes-Dispatch poll published Sunday. Nineteen percent of thosesurveyed were undecided.   Recent polls have shown Wilder with a lead of 4 to 15 percentagepoints.   Continuing a weekend swing through the state's southwesternmountains, Wilder said he relied on strong support in thecoal-mining region for his successful campaign for lieutenantgovernor in 1985.   ``The kinds of encouragement you gave made it possible for me tocarry it on from county to county and from city to city,'' Wildertold supporters in the town of Ben Hur.   In the town of Honaker, Wilder addressed a crowd that included afew dozen United Mine Workers members who have been on strikeagainst Pittson Coal Group Inc. for seven months.   ``No one wants to see that matter settled more than thisperson,'' Wilder said.   Miners have criticized outgoing Democratic Gov. Gerald L.Baliles for sending state troopers to the coalfields to keep order.Wilder has not promised to pull the troopers out, and he has saidhe supports the state's right-to-work law, which bars compulsoryunion membership.   Still, the miners think Wilder would help them, said unionmember Danny Wells of Honaker. ``I think he might do somethingdifferent,'' Wells said.   Wilder told reporters he became confident he would win after aJuly debate in which Coleman backed off his anti-abortion views.Wilder subsequently promoted his support of legalized abortion intelevision commercials, but he did not mention the issue thisweekend.   At a political picnic near Front Royal, 70 miles west ofWashington, D.C., Coleman urged supporters to get out the vote.   ``What I'm interested in talking about is inspiring the votersthat it's not in the bag,'' he said. ``We've got to work hard ifwe're going to have a victory.''   ``People have started realizing that my vision and my plan forVirginia are one of optimism and hope. The undecideds are going ourway overwhelmingly.''</TEXT></DOC>
