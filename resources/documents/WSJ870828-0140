The 750,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions, or Cosatu, which includes the striking National Union of Mineworkers, said its affiliates, spanning the major industries, were preparing for a national strike in sympathy with the miners. Cosatu officials warned that they would call for a mass walkout if the mine owners continue to fire striking miners and bring in strikebreakers.    The mine owners, for their part, seem determined to do just that. At the same time that Cosatu was making its threat, Anglo American Corp., the country's largest mining house, was dismissing more than 15,000 miners who had refused to meet the company's back-to-work ultimatum. Anglo said another 15,000 miners face similar dismissal ultimatums today. Other companies fired about 5,000 workers yesterday. Although the mine workers' strike is legal under South Africa's labor legislation, the law also gives employers the right to fire striking workers.    Yesterday's moves introduced a new level of tension, and a greater potential for violence, to the miners' strike, which is now in its 19th day. Earlier in the week, negotiations to solve the dispute, which centers around wages, were reopened, and both sides appeared optimistic. But late Wednesday night, the union rejected the companies' offer to improve some benefits, and the hope of a quick and peaceful end to the strike faded.    &quot;We've now reached phase two of the strike: All of the regular channels appear to have been exhausted,&quot; said an Anglo spokesman. &quot;We've hit a stone wall; the process has collapsed.&quot;    The breakdown in the negotiations has left the mine owners wondering whether the union is more concerned with scoring a political victory for the nation's disenfranchised blacks than winning an economic one for its members. And the union is left wondering whether the companies are out to break it.    Following the union rejection of the latest proposal, the Chamber of Mines, which represents South Africa's six major mining houses, said, &quot;Mine management will now be pursuing the objective of getting their mines back to normal production.&quot; This indicates that management intends to fire striking workers and replace them with new, non-unionized, ones. These workers most likely would come from South Africa's neighboring countries, which traditionally have supplied the majority of miners.    The miners' union, which is the largest and most politically oriented of the country's black trade unions, is determined to prevent this. Yesterday, Anglo confirmed that some 3,000 miners facing dismissal were staging an underground sit-in at the Western Deep Levels Mine, the deepest gold mine in the world. The mine owners worry that this tactic could catch on. &quot;How are we supposed to get them out of there?&quot; asked an Anglo official.    In the past, striking miners have reacted violently to workers who wouldn't join them. The mine owners have said that several miners who wanted to return to work already have been killed during the strike. So far, a total of six miners have died and more than 300 have been injured during clashes at the mines. A move by the mine owners to bring in new workers could trigger violence on a much larger scale.    It also could touch off a nationwide general strike. &quot;Black workers in this country have few weapons,&quot; said Jay Naidoo, Cosatu's general secretary. &quot;The one weapon we have is the withdrawal of our labor.&quot;    Mr. Naidoo said Cosatu is urging leaders of neighboring countries to discourage the recruitment of strikebreakers, and it is appealing to international trade unions not to handle South African coal and gold.    &quot;The mine owners have made it a test of strength and that is what it is going to be,&quot; he said. &quot;From our side we are determined to win it.&quot;    The miners' strike, which has shaken the bedrock of South Africa's economy, is estimated to involve between 210,000 and 350,000 workers, making it the largest in the country's history. It remains to be seen who will break first: the mine owners, who are incurring a daily loss estimated at $15 million, or the union, which fears the damage that mass firings could do to its membership volume.    At the moment, both sides are standing firm. They say that the offers put on the table earlier this week were their final ones.    The union, which originally demanded a 30% across-the-board pay increase, has scaled back its demand to 27%. The owners, who are offering wage increases between 15% and 23.4%, proposed increased vacation time and better death benefits. The union wants the benefits to be translated into wages, something the owners refuse to do. The union says miners earn an average of about $200 a month.    &quot;We're not budging on wages. We've come to the end of the road,' said the Anglo spokesman.    &quot;The strike continues until our demands are met,&quot; said Cyril Ramaphosa, the leader of the miners union. &quot;It remains our view that the strike is a just struggle by thousands of mine workers for a living wage.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
