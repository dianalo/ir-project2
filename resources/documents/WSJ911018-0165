But Lasmo's offer immediately ignited speculation aboutdefenses and counterbids, and Ultramar's stock price advancedwell beyond Lasmo's offer of 315 pence a share in stock.London securities analysts said investors were betting that atakeover struggle would unlock most of Ultramar's breakupvalue, estimated to be as high as 400 pence a share. Ultramarhas about 371 million shares outstanding.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Lasmo's share price sank slightly belowWednesday's closing level of 315 pence, which had been thebasis of the one-for-one stock-swap offer. In late trading onthe London Stock Exchange, Lasmo shares fell to 312 pence,reducing the company's offer by #11 million.   Including assumption of Ultramar's net debt, which stoodat about #850 million on June 30, the total indicated valueof the deal was about #2 billion at the close of businessyesterday.   In hectic trading, Ultramar's stock reached 347 pence ashare, up 70 pence, or 25%, on the day. Several analysts saidthe rise was fueled by rumors that Elf Aquitaine, the Frenchpetroleum giant, was preparing a 375-pence-a-share bid.   An Elf spokesman said he was unable to comment, butanalysts said further action could be expected -- at aminimum, a defense from Ultramar that might involve assetsales or spinoffs, providing value for shareholders.   &quot;You can see from the share prices that {Lasmo's bid} justwon't work now,&quot; said Angela Burns of County NatWestSecurities. &quot;It's a pity in a way. It was a very nice, verycheeky bid.&quot;   In its bid announcement, Lasmo was highly critical ofUltramar's current management and said the company was &quot;insevere need of restructuring.&quot; Lasmo proposed divestingUltramar's refining and gasoline-selling facilities, whichare based in Canada and the western U.S., and combining theremaining businesses with its own exploration and extractionbusiness. Lasmo said the divestment might come throughselling the Ultramar assets, or through flotation of a newcompany, with the proceeds used to pay down debt.   Lasmo also argued that its strong financial position wouldallow Ultramar to get better value from the remaining assets,through increased drilling and further exploration.   Ultramar, which called Lasmo's offer &quot;most unwelcome,&quot; hasinterests in many North Sea oil and gas fields, and has alucrative contract to supply liquefied natural gas fromIndonesia to Japan and Taiwan. Analysts said such businesseswould dovetail with Lasmo's interests, which aregeographically diverse but heavily concentrated in oil.   But Ultramar also has a heavy debt load, amounting to 87%of equity on June 30, and analysts said it has a history ofunderperforming its rivals, including Lasmo. It has been aperennial target of takeover rumors, with the most commonsupposed suitors being Elf, British Gas PLC and BritishPetroleum Co.   For the six months ended June 30, Lasmo posted anafter-tax profit of #33.6 million on revenue of #153.3million. Earnings per share were 8.5 pence. For 1990, thecompany had an after-tax profit of #83.1 million on revenueof #358.1 million.   Ultramar reported a loss, after tax and minorityinterests, of #21.6 million on revenue of #886.4 millionduring the same six months. Losses per share were 5.8 pence.For 1990, the company posted an after-tax profit of #133.7million on revenue of #1.76 billion.   Ultramar said its board was meeting with its advisers toconsider Lasmo's offer. Until the board issues a formalresponse, Ultramar said, it advised stockholders not to sellany shares.   ---   Charles Fleming in Paris contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
