The blustering cold followed days of balmy weather crowned byspring blossoms that started sprouting a week ago as temperaturessoared to the 70s.   Tuesday's early morning temperatures hovered around freezing inthe northern half of the country with gusts of wind reaching 30 mph.   The snow coated trees and lawns but did not disrupt morningtraffic because it melted as soon as it hit the streets.   The Paris weather bureau said the impression that a cold wavehad struck stemmed from the contrast between the freezingtemperatures and the warm weather last week. Forecasters said snowand cold temperatures are normal for early April in the northernpart of the country.   In the south, in Provence and along the French Riviera, wherethere was concern about the lack of moisture, one-half to nearly 2inches of rain fell in the past 24 hours. Rain also fell in thePyrenees along the Spanish border.   In the English Channel, winds gusted up to 50 mph and waves of20 feet were reported off the Channel Islands.   Snow and sleet hit Belgium, chilling residents who also had beenenjoying warm weather. Temperatures dropped to 36 degrees and thewinds picked up.   Over the weekend, Belgian beaches saw the first sunbathers inswimsuits and the public parks were full of families enjoying68-degree temperatures.   But on Tuesday, the weather office reported more than an inch ofsnow _ the first in more than a year _ in central Belgium.   Forecasters said temperatures were expected to warm up againlater this week.</TEXT></DOC>
