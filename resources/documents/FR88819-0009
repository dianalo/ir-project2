It requires depository institutions that have over$10 million in assets, and have offices in metropolitan statistical areas(MSAs) or primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), to disclose annuallytheir originations and purchases of mortgage and home improvement loans.Data must be itemized by census tract (or by county, in some instances)and also by type of loan. A statement covering the data on a calendar yearbasis must be made available to the public and reported to the institution'sfederal supervisory agency by March 31 following the calendar year forwhich the data are compiled. When originally passed in 1975, HMDA contained a ``sunset'' provision underwhich the act was to expire in 1980. A number of temporary extensions wereenacted and, in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-242, section 565, 101 Stat. 1815, 1945), the Congress permanentlyextended HMDA by striking the sunset provision from the act. The statutoryamendments were signed into law on February 5, 1988. In addition to thepermanent extension, these amendments expanded the coverage of HMDA toinclude mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies and savingsand loan holding companies, as well as savings and loan service corporations.On May 13, 1988, the Board published for public comment an amended RegulationC to implement these and other changes (53 FR 17061). With some changesthat are identified in the sections that follow, the Board is now adoptingthe revised regulation in final form. <ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Regulatory Review </ITAG>The Board's Regulatory Improvement Program calls for periodic review ofeach of the Board's regulations to determine whether the regulation canbe simplified. The Board conducted such a review of Regulation C and madea number of changes. The text of the regulation was revised to improveits clarity. Obsolete provisions were deleted, footnotes eliminated, anda detailed appendix regarding state exemptions replaced by a brief referencein the regulation. In addition, the instructions to the reporting formswere significantly reworked and should be easier to follow. <ITAG tagnum="84">(3) Availability of Aggregated Data </ITAG>As required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Federal FinancialInstitutions Examination Council (with support from the Federal ReserveBoard and the other financial regulators) aggregates loan data receivedfrom all reporting institutions in each MSA. The Examination Council alsoproduces tables for each MSA showing lending patterns according to demographiccharacteristics such as income level and age of housing stock. These tables,together with data on the individual institutions, are sent to centraldata depositories in each MSA. The act specifies that the aggregated dataand related tables shall be available no later than December 31 followingthe calendar year to which they relate. Typically, the Examination Councilhas released these reports by late November or early December.The conference report accompanying the HMDA amendments indicates Congressionalinterest in having the HMDA data available at the central data depositoriesearlier than is now the case. Member agencies of the Examination Councilare implementing changes to data processing procedures in order to facilitatethe earlier availability of the data. The Board believes that the revisionof Regulation C, together with the expanded instructions for reporting,will serve this purpose by enhancing compliance and by reducing errorsthat require editing following data submission. Several commenters on the proposal suggested ways in which the aggregationand presentation of aggregated data might be improved. Since the aggregationprocess is not governed by Regulation C, these suggestions will be broughtto the attention of the Examination Council. <ITAG tagnum="84">(4) Section-by-section summary </ITAG>The changes made to each section of the revised regulation are discussedbelow. Section 203.1 Authority, purpose, and scope. A reference has been added in andSection; 203.1(a) to reflect the approvalof information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act.A reference to HMDA has been added to the purpose statement in andSection;203.1(b). Now that the term ``depository institution'' is no longer usedin the regulation (eliminating the possibility of confusion), the term``depositories'' has replaced the term ``repositories'' in andSection; 203.1(d),referring to the facilities where data is available in each MSA. Section 203.2 Definitions. Section 203.2 contains definitions of terms used in the regulation, andhas been revised as follows. <T3>Act</T3>. The definition of ``act'' in andSection; 203.2(a) has beenupdated. <T3>Branch office</T3>. What qualifies as a branch office has several consequencesfor an institution. First, institutions that do not have a home or branchoffice in an MSA or PMSA are exempt from HMDA. Second, HMDA data must beitemized by census tract for loans on property located in any MSA or PMSAin which the institution has a home or branch office. For loans on propertylocated in other MSAs or PMSAs (or not located in an MSA or PMSA at all),the data are reported as an aggregate sum without geographic itemization.Third, the data must be made available to the public at one branch office(or home office) in each MSA or PMSA where the institution has home orbranch offices. Finally, the institution must post notices in all branchoffices located in MSAs or PMSAs to inform the public of the availabilityof the HMDA data. The revised definition set forth in andSection; 203.2(b) takes account ofthe difference between the branch office structure of the newly coveredmortgage banking firms and that of depository institutions such as banksand thrift institutions. While depository institutions must obtain approvalfrom federal or state regulatory agencies to establish branch offices,mortgage banking firms generally are not required to obtain such approval.Accordingly, the definition of branch office differs for the two classesof institutions. The definition in revised andSection; 203.2(b)(1)(i) appliesto banks, thrifts, and other depository institutions; it is the same asin the current regulation and is based on the approval process. For other covered institutions, the Board defines ``branch office'' inandSection; 203.2(b)(1)(ii) as an office of the institution that takes applicationsfrom the public for home purchase or home improvement loans. In responseto comments, the words ``of the institution'' were added to make clearthat branch offices include only facilities of the institution itself,not offices of affiliates or other third parties. This branch office definitionwill apply to mortgage banking subsidiaries of holding companies and savingand loan service corporations (except for those that are majority ownedby a single thrift institution). The definition of the term ``financial institution'' in the May proposalwould have resulted in the application of the new branch office definitionto majority-owned subsidiaries of depository institutions. As discussedbelow, the final rule does not incorporate that change. Accordingly, majority-ownedsubsidiaries of depository institutions (including majority-owned servicecorporations) will continue to be governed by the current rule, which focuseson the branch locations of the parent institution. <T3>Federally related mortgage loan.</T3> Banks and other depository institutionsare subject to HMDA only if they make ``federally related mortgage loans.''The definition of that term, currently in footnote 1, has been restatedmore concisely and incorporated in the text of the regulation as andSection;203.2(d). <T3>Financial institution</T3>. Section 203.2(e) defines the institutionscovered by the regulation; the term ``financial institution'' replacesthe term ``depository institution.'' This change is designed to avoid theconfusion that might arise from the fact that, in ordinary usage, the termdepository institution signifies institutions such as banks and thrifts,not mortgage banking firms and other institutions that do not take deposits.The new definition encompasses both the traditional depository institutionsand the new class of covered institutions: Savings and loan service corporationsand mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies and savingsand loan holding companies.As noted above, depository institutions are subject to HMDA only if theymake federally related mortgage loans. The statutory amendments do notcondition coverage of the newly covered institutions on the making of federallyrelated mortgage loans. The regulatory definition of ``financial institution''parallels the statute.A number of commenters asked the Board to clarify the term ``mortgage bankingsubsidiary.'' Many expressed concern that, without further elaboration,the term might be construed to cover consumer finance subsidiaries of holdingcompanies. The Board believes that the use of the qualifying term ``mortgagebanking'' in the statutory amendments suggests that the Congress did notintend to expand coverage to institutions that make only a limited numberof mortgage loans. Section 203.2(e)(1)(ii) of the final regulation definesa mortgage banking subsidiary as an institution that makes home purchaseloans in an amount greater than 10% of its total loan volume, measuredin dollars. This cutoff is intended to ensure that any holding companysubsidiary whose line of business is other than mortgage banking, but thatmakes a small number of home purchase loans, will not be required to report.The May proposal treated majority-owned subsidiaries of depository institutionsas financial institutions in their own right. Consequently, these institutionswould have been considered to have branch offices in any MSA where theyhave offices for taking loan applications from the public. A number ofcommenters opposed this requirement because of the significant increasein the reporting burden for subsidiaries that have offices in MSAs otherthan the MSAs in which the parent institution has branches. Moreover, aregulatory agency expressed concern that some of the data presently reportedby these subsidiaries would no longer be reported in itemized form. Uponfurther analysis, the Board has decided to retain the current rule whichtreats majority-owned subsidiaries as part of the parent institution.A parallel issue arises regarding the treatment of savings and loan servicecorporations. Although the statutory amendments brought savings and loanservice corporations specifically within the coverage of HMDA, servicecorporations that are majority-owned subsidiaries of thrift institutionsalready were covered by Regulation C. Because of the statute's specificreference to service corporations, however, the Board considered whethera majority-owned savings and loan service corporation should continue tobe treated as the subsidiary of its parent institution or characterizedas a ``savings and loan service corporation'' under the new definitionin the regulation.If treated as a majority-owned subsidiary, the service corporation wouldcontinue to report, as it does now, on a consolidated basis with its parent;its data would be itemized for MSAs where its parent has offices, and wouldinclude FHA lending. If the institution were treated as a ``savings andloan service corporation,'' however, significantly different rules wouldapply. The institution would itemize data only for MSAs where it has officesfor taking loan applications, rather than where its parent has branch offices,and it would be required to exclude FHA loans from its reports.The Board believes that the intent of the Congress in enacting the statutoryamendments was to extend HMDA coverage to institutions that are not alreadycovered. Until now, only those service corporations that are majority-ownedsubsidiaries of thrifts have been reporting (in conjunction with theirparent). Other service corporations were not subject to the regulation(for example, a corporation established by multiple thrifts, none holdinga majority interest). The Board believes that the amendments were intendedto apply to these latter institutions. Accordingly, under andSection; 203.2(e)(1)(iii)and (e)(2) in the revised definition of ``financial institution,'' majority-ownedsavings and loan service corporations are deemed to be part of their parentinstitution.The Board also has proposed to amend the definition of financial institutionto cover industrial banks, which in recent years have taken on many ofthe characteristics of commercial and savings banks. Based on the commentsand further analysis, the Board has decided not to include industrial bankswithin the definition of financial institution.<T3>Home improvement and home purchase loans. </T3>The definitions of ``homeimprovement loan'' and ``home purchase loan'' are set forth in andSection;203.2(f) and (g).The definition of ``home improvement loan,'' though revised for clarity,is substantively unchanged. The revised definition omits the referenceto refinancings found in the current regulation because home improvementloans are generally not refinanced. the provision (footnotes 2 and 3 inthe current regulation) permitting any first-lien loan to be reported asa home purchase loan now appears in the instructions rather than the regulatorytext.The definition of home purchase loan currently is limited to loans forthe purchase of ``residential real property.'' In contrast, a home improvementloan is defined in terms of ``residential dwelling,'' and may include residentialstructures such as mobile homes that are not classified as real propertyin some states. In publishing the proposed regulation, the Board requestedcomment on whether dwelling units such as mobile or manufactured homesshould specifically be covered under the home improvement or the home purchaseloan definition, or both.Although some commenters preferred that they be excluded, a majority believedthat it was appropriate for loans on such property to be disclosed, giventhat they are an important source of housing in some areas. Accordingly,the definitions of home purchase and home improvement loans specificallyinclude mobile and manufactured homes, whether or not these dwellings areconsidered real property under state law. This provision becomes effectiveon January 1, 1989, and therefore will not require a change in the reportingof loan data for 1988.Several commenters requested that the disclosure requirements for homeequity lines be clarified. The instructions to the reporting forms, containedin Appendix A, specify that the data for home improvement loans may includethat portion of a home equity line of credit which the borrower indicates,when the line is established, will be used for home improvement purposes.Commenters also requested clarification on the treatment of assumptions.The Board believes that if an institution expressly agrees in writing witha new party to accept that party as the obligor on an existing home purchaseloan, the transaction should be treated as a new home purchase loan. Butif a new party takes over an existing obligation without a written agreement,the loan is not reportable under HMDA.Section 203.3 Exempt institutions.Section 203.3 excludes from the coverage of the regulation small institutions,institutions without offices in MSAs, and institutions that are subjectto a similar state law and have been granted an exemption from the federallaw.The provisions of this section have been reorganized and the language clarified;the substantive rules remain unchanged. Material relating to state lawexemptions has been grouped together in andSection; 203.3(b). A new andSection;203.3(b)(2) has been added to indicate that a state or a financial institutionmay apply to the Board for an exemption from the regulation based on theexistence of a similar state disclosure law. This reference replaces thedetailed discussion in current Appendix B (which the Board has deleted)about the filing of applications for state exemptions.The Board has received questions about how data should be reported in caseswhere a merger of two or more financial institutions occurs. In some cases,the merger of two institutions that previously were both exempt, becauseof their asset size, may produce a successor institution whose assets exceedthe $10 million cutoff. In other cases, a covered institution may mergewith one that was previously exempt because of asset size or location outsidean MSA.In the case of two exempt institutions, the successor institution thatbecomes subject to HMDA will be required to disclose loan data for thecalendar year following the year in which the merger took place.If two institutions merge and only one of them was previously covered,the successor institution is required to report loan data, for the coveredinstituton, for the calendar year in which the merger took place. Thatreport may, but need not, also include loan data for the previously exemptinstitution. Beginning with the following calendar year, the institutionwill file a consolidated report that includes all loan data.A similar reporting question arises when the institutions that merge areboth covered institutions. If two covered institutions merge, the successorinstitution may file a consolidated report for the calendar year in whichthey merge, but has the option of filing separate reports for that year.Beginning with the following calendar year, the institution will file aconsolidated report that includes all loan data.Section 203.4 Compilation of loan data.Section 203.4 sets forth the requirements for itemization of loan databy census tract or county and by type of loan, and is the basis for thedetailed instructions that accompany the reporting forms contained in therevised Appendix A. Substantive changes are noted below. Revised andSection;203.4(a) incorporates material from current andSection; 203.4(a) and (b).Section andSection; 203.(4)(b) has been restructured for readability, andalso incorporates the rules on MSAs and census tracts presently found inandSection; 203.4(d).With regard to census tracts, the revised regulation refers to ``the mostrecent census tract series'' issued by the Census Bureau. The most recentseries is currently the 1980 series. Use of the 1980 series is necessarybecause 1980 census data is used by the Federal Financial InstitutionsExamination Council in preparing tables illustrating lending patterns ineach MSA.Section 203.4(c) lists types of loans to be excluded from the disclosures.The six listed in paragraph (c)(1) apply both to depository institutionsand to the newly covered institutions. The exclusions for loans made ina fiduciary capacity, loans on unimproved land, and certain refinancingsare drawn from current andSection; 203.4(c). The final rule specifies thata refinancing between the original parties should not be reported if theonly increase in the principal results from closing costs or unpaid financecharges that are being financed.Two of the remaining three exclusions (temporary financing and the purchaseof an interest in a pool of loans) were moved into revised andSection; 203.4from the definition of ``home purchase loan'' in current andSection; 203.2(f).The sixth exclusion relates to loan servicing rights. The purchase of servicingrights in secondary market transactions is a practice common among mortgagebankers. When loans are sold, for example, the buyer may issue securitiesbacked by a pool of loans that it has acquired. The right to service theloans, however, may be retained by the seller/originator of the mortgages.These servicing rights may later be transferred from one institution toanother for a purchase price that is usually a small percentage (such as1 or 2 percent) of the value of the underlying loans.The act and regulation require institutions to report data on mortgageloans that they purchase. The Board believes that a covered institution'spurchase of these servicing rights does not accurately reflect the extentto which an institution has made mortgage credit available in a community.Accordingly, the regulation excludes from the reporting requirement thepurchase solely of servicing rights to mortgage loans.Section 203.4(c)(2) applies only to mortgage banking subsidiaries and savingsand loan service corporations that are not majority-owned. It excludesfrom the reporting requirement loans that are insured under Title I orII of the National Housing Act (that is, FHA-insured home improvement andhome purchase loans), implementing new section 304(g) of HMDA, which expresslyprovides for their exclusion. (Under section 311 of HMDA, data on FHA-insuredloans made by these types of lenders are to be collected by the U.S. Departmentof Housing and Urban Development.) As discussed under Appendix A, the Boardhas provided an optional form HMDA-2A that may be used by these institutionsto disclose their FHA lending activity.Section 203.5 Disclosure and reporting.Section 203.5 relates to making loan data available at offices of an institutionand reporting the data to supervisory agencies. As under the current provisions,disclosure statements for a given calendar year are due by the followingMarch 31.This section also requires institutions to post notices regarding the availabilityof HMDA data. Posters that may be used to meet the notice requirement areavailable from federal supervisory agencies. The revised section clarifiesthat an institution may, in its notice, give the location where disclosurestatements are available.Section 203.6 Enforcement.Section 203.6 sets forth rules relating to administrative enforcement andbona fide errors. The language and structure of this section have beenrevised to clarify its provisions.Appendix A Forms and instructions.Appendix A of the current regulation, which lists supervisory agencies,is designated Appendix B in the revised regulation; and the current AppendixC, containing the mortgage disclosure forms, is now Appendix A. The revised Appendix A contains two reporting forms and accompanying instructions,plus an optional form. Institutions must use the prescribed format of theHMDA-1 or HMDA-2 form, as appropriate, but are not required to use theform itself. An institution may, for example, choose to produce a computerprintout of its disclosure statement instead.The HMDA-1 reporting form continues to be the prescribed form for use bycommercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, buildingand loan associations, homestead associations (including cooperative banks),and credit unions. The instructions for completing the form have been expandedsignificantly to facilitate compliance; the form itself is unchanged exceptfor minor revisions. Column headings have been changed to read ``totaldollar amount'' instead of ``principal amount,'' but the data to be reportedin these columns remain the same. Accordingly, institutions will not haveto make changes in their data processing procedures for compiling the data.A signature line has been added, calling for an officer of the reportinginstitution to certify to the accuracy of the report.A new form HMDA-2 and accompanying instructions have been added for useby savings and loan service corporations and mortgage banking subsidiariesof bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, whichwill not report FHA loans. The provision of a new form is intended to minimizeconfusion for reporting institutions. The Board has provided an optionalform, HMDA-2A, that may be used by institutions that wish to maintain apublic record of their FHA lending activity. Use of the form is optional;the form will not be submitted to supervisory agencies, but could be madeavailable to the public (along with the required HMDA data) at the institution'sown offices.Notice of the changes to the HMDA-1 reporting form and of the Board's adoptionof a new HMDA-2 and HMDA-2A is being published elsewhere in this issueof the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, to comply with the requirements of the PaperworkReduction Act.Appendix B Federal supervisory agenciesAppendix B of the current regulation, relating to applications for stateexemptions, has been deleted. In its place, a reference to the availabilityof state exemptions has been added to andSection; 203.3.Current Appendix A, which lists enforcement agencies, has been designatedAppendix B. The Board has amended the appendix to incorporate referencesspecifying that mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank holding companiesshall submit HMDA reports to the Federal Reserve System, and that savingsand loan service corporations and mortgage banking subsidiaries of savingsand loan holding companies shall submit theirs to the Federal Home LoanBank System. These reporting arrangements are appropriate in view of theFederal Reserve's general supervisory responsibility for non-bank subsidiariesof bank holding companies, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System's parallelresponsibility for savings and loan service corporations and mortgage bankingsubsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies.(5) <T3>Effective dates.</T3> Mortgage banking subsidiaries of holding companies,and savings and loan service corporations that are not majority-owned byany one thrift institution, will be required to report data on loan originationsand purchases for calendar year 1988. Their first report will be due onMarch 31, 1989. A number of commenters asked that these institutions notbe required to report data for 1988. However, because the statutory amendmentsspecify the effective data for coverage, the Board is unable to delay thereporting requirements.Changes related to reporting of mobile and manufactured home loans, whetheror not these dwellings are characterized as realty under state law, willtake effect on January 1, 1989 (to be reported on statements filed in Marchof 1990).
