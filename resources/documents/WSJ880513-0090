Bass Group Inc. to acquire deeply troubled American Savings andamp; Loan Association, a unit of Financial Corp. of America.    However, the congressmen, Republican Rep. Norm Shumway and Democrat Rep. Richard Lehman, cautioned that negotiations between the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Bass Group aren't complete.    &quot;The conclusion is not imminent, and finalization will take several weeks,&quot; Rep. Shumway said. &quot;Other agencies are involved and further review and clearance will be necessary.&quot;    Reps. Shumway and Lehman met yesterday with Bank Board member Roger Martin and a representative of Bass Group, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas. Rep. Shumway said that if the Bass Group acquires American Savings, it would keep American's headquarters in Stockton, Calif., and wouldn't &quot;substantially alter&quot; the thrift's &quot;management structure.&quot;    Officials familiar with the negotiations said the acquisition could require more than $1.5 billion in federal aid. It isn't clear whether Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. would receive any compensation for American Savings.    The Bank Board declined to comment on the statement by the two congressmen.    A spokesman for Bass Group couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
