Greyhound, America's only nationwide bus line, has beenoperating under the protection of federal bankruptcy laws sinceJune.   Any deal to take over the bus line would have to include thereturn of the 6,300 union drivers who have been on strike sinceMarch 2, Ravitch said.   ``I think that it's fair to say the only viable deal is one inwhich the union is a participant,'' Ravitch said.   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said he had never heard ofthe firm and noted that under federal bankruptcy laws, the bus linehas until early October to file a reorganization plan and thenanother 60 days to prove the reorganization will work.   The company has no plans to voluntarily sell the bus line,Gravley said.   ``We are building cash balances. We're having a good summer.Things are going pretty well. Business as usual has been our themesong,'' Gravley said.   Ravitch said the investment banking group was approached aboutthe deal by Greyhound's creditors. The bus line suffered a loss ofmore than $50 million in the first three months of 1990 soughtChapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 4.   Ravitch declined to elaborate on details of any deal, sayingonly that the investment firm was ``trying to get data concerningthe company. We've had a discussion with the union and we'reproceeding.''   An official with the Amalgamated Transit Union who asked to gounnamed said the union is still interested in some type of employeebuyout.   Blackstone considers the union's participation crucial, the ATUofficial said, because union drivers are experienced and alsobecause returning them to work would alleviate millions of dollarsin porivers strike, which entered its sixth month on Thursday,was marred by shootings, bomb threats and other violent incidentsin its first few months. The two sides have not set down to try andnegotiate a settlement since early May.</TEXT></DOC>
