The complex magnetic susceptibility was determinedexperimentally in relation the strength of the magnetic field. The magnetizationrelaxation time was also determined as a function of field strength.The physical parameters of the liquid were determined by representingthe experimental data in a Cowell-Cowell diagram. It was found that thedependence of the magnetic susceptibility dispersion of a colloid ofmagnetically rigid particles on field strength can be described mathematicallyin the rigid dipole approximation if proper allowance is made for thedistribution of magnetic relaxation time.</TEXT></DOC>
