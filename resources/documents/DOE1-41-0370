Proton bombardments were made at eight energies from 40 to160 MeV. The proton fluences were calibrated with a Faraday cup at eachenergy. The /sup 24/Na (15 h half-life) cross-section was determinedby counting the 1.369 MeV gamma rays in a 90 cm/sup 3/ Ge(Li) spectrometer.The /sup 26/Al (703 000 yr half-life) cross section was determined bydirect atom counting with accelerator mass spectrometry.</TEXT></DOC>
