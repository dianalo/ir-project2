Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, alsosaid the insurgents had new weapons and planned increased attackson Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul.   A special security court in the capital convicted a 23-year-oldPalestinian of spying for the guerrillas trying to oust theSoviet-sponsored government.   Amani told reporters government troops overcame blockades theinsurgents had established at two points on the Salang Highway,which runs north for 260 miles through the Hindu Kush mountainrange to the Soviet border.   Although insurgents had virtually closed the highway, about 100supply trucks broke through last week, becoming the first convoy toarrive in Kabul since April 6. Amani said he expected 600 trucksstranded on the road to arrive soon, but gave no details.   About 65 trucks left Kabul for Jalalabad, which the rebelsbesieged March 6 in their first major offensive after Sovietmilitary forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15.   He said reconnaissance flights showed the insurgents to beplanning a new offensive around the city, which is about 45 milesfrom the Pakistan border, but did not elaborate.   Amani said rockets and heavy artillery rounds hit Jalalabad,wounding a civilian. He claimed 32 guerrillas, including fivecommanders, were killed in a retaliatory strike by governmentforces.   Each side in the war exaggerates the other's casualties and theconflicting estimates cannot be reconciled.   Guerrilla spokesmen in Pakistan reported heavy fighting outsideJalalabad after a weekend in which the insurgents claimed to havehave captured seven government outposts. They and Amani alsoreported fighting at Khost, another eastern garrison town about 75miles to the south.   The Afghan News Agency of the seven-party guerrilla alliancebased in Pakistan quoted a commander named Fazli Haq Muhajid assaying insurgents breached Jalalabad's southern defenses for thefirst time in the offensive.   In Kabul, the national security court convicted Abdul Razaq ofspying for the guerrillas. The three-judge panel said the youngPalestinian deserved the death penalty but was sentenced to 16years in prison because he asked for mercy.   Razaq was found guilty of illegally entering Afghanistan,military spying, collaborating with insurgents and trying topersuade soldiers to defect.   He admitted entering Afghanistan illegally, but said his purposewas to preach the Islamic faith.   ``I am not a professional killer,'' he told the court. ``I cameto make peace between two (guerrilla) commanders. I am not a spy.My objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides.''   Soldiers who stormed a guerrilla hideout in northwesternAfghanistan arrested Razaq in December, prosecutors said. Razaqsaid his home was in a refugee camp in Jordan.   On April 5, the court convicted two Pakistanis of spying. Onewas sentenced to 16 years, the other to 18 years.   Pakistan, the United States and China are major supporters ofthe guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April1978. Soviet forces entered the war in December 1979 and withdrewnine years later under a U.N.-mediated agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
