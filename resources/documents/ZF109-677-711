MultiSync 3D monitor.andP;  Sampledrawings and documents created in Autodesk Inc.'s AutoCAD release 10 andrelease 11, WordPerfect Corp's WordPerfect 5.1 and Lotus Development Corp's1-2-3 2.01 were cataloged, in addition to miscellaneous TIF, PCX and RLCfiles intended to simulate faxed and scanned documents.andM;AutoEDMS was customized by its developer, ACS Telecom Corp., to enabletesting in a stand-alone environment.andP;  Consequently, the network plotting andprinting features were not tested.andP;  The reviewed products have differentfeatures, one focusing on database functions and the other on viewingdocuments within AutoCAD.andP;  Each was tested to the limit of its features.andM;PC Week Labs generated some typical projects consisting of both drawings anddocuments.andP;  For example, one project consisted of 10 AutoCAD drawings, atechnical specification document, two engineering change orders and afacsimile.andM;During testing, drawings and documents were created, added and updated, and afull audit trail was analyzed.andP;  Reports about whether action had been takenon a project were created.andP;  New projects with customized database recordswere created, and the records were modified after documents were added.andO;Drawings and documents were transferred between projects, and projects werebacked up and restored.andP;  -- C.H.andM;CADvance Upgrade Provides Details Of Drawing's StatusandM;One limitation of electronic document-management systems (EDMSs) is theirinability to determine the status of a drawing.andP;  For example, AutoEDMS,although it can estimate the time spent creating and editing a drawing ,cannot tell whether the drawing was actually modified or only examined orplotted.andP;  This is because nearly all PC-based CAD programs do not supply thenecessary reference to the EDMS product.andM;Version 4.0 of CADvance from IsiCAD Corp., of Anaheim, Calif., comes closest.andO;It has features that provide information about who created a file, when itwas edited and how long it took to edit.andP;  It is stored with the drawing, andis available regardless of whether the drawing was modified while on the LANor at a  stand-alone workstation.andP;  --C.H.andM;AutoCAD Add-In Manages DatabaseandM;The van der Roest Group Inc.'s CAD/BASE 1.1 is an AutoCAD add-in product thatacts as a database manager for AutoCAD drawings.andP;  However, it providesdatabase abilities for single drawings rather than performingdocument-management control of multiple documents.andM;CAD/BASE maintains a database of the components within an AutoCAD drawing.andO;It can generate such items as the bill for materials sold, cost-estimates andfacilities management reports.andP;  The database is linked to the AutoCADdrawing, but can include information not present in the drawing.andP;  The commoninformation in the drawing and database is dynamic, and changes made in thedatabase are reflected in the drawing and vice versa.andM;Contact The van der Roest Group, in Santa Ana, Calif., at (714) 542-2201.andO;--C.H.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
