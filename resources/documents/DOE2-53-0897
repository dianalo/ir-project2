<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-0897 </DOCNO><TEXT>Potential for new oil discoveries both on land and offshore in Floridaappears to be best in the offshore portion of the South Florida Basinand in the areas in northwest Florida which are underlain by the SmackoverFormation. Evidence for this appraisal includes newly acquired deep reflectionseismic lines in the South Florida Basin. Geologic features believedto be present include Paleozoic strata lying unconformably beneath anigneous flow, normal faulting, and reefal development in carbonate rocks.In offshore northwest Florida, although no official announcement hasbeen made, there is a strong possibility that a thick section of payis present in the Smackover and Norphlet Formations in OCS-G-6417 onthe Destin Dome about 40 miles south of the city of Destin. This welland the excellent Norphlet tests in the Mobile Bay area should lead tomore wildcat well drilling in northwest Florida. Paleozoic drilling inFlorida has ceased, and large blocks of acreage have been dropped afterfive dry holes were drilled in the past few years. The Sunniland Formationof Lower Cretaceous is a favorite and enduring target. The SunnilandField was discovered in 1943 and an estimated 100 million barrels ofreserves have been found in the six major fields in the South FloridaBasin.</TEXT></DOC>
