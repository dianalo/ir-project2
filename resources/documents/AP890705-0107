Kanellopoulos said officials will investigate a banking scandal,alleged kickbacks in the purchases of U.S. and French-madewarplanes, wiretapping, and missing government files since the newgovernment took power Sunday.   The conservative New Democracy party and a Communist Party-ledalliance that calls itself the Coalition of Left and Progress formeda government after no party won an absolute majority in the June 18elections.   The new government partners said they would govern for threemonths to investigate and prosecute officials in former PremierAndreas Papandreou's government who allegedly were involved inmultimillion-dollar banking and financial scandals.   The Socialists' alleged involvement in the scandals and70-year-old Papandreou's romance with a 35-year-old woman before hedivorced contributed to his downfall after eight years in office.   On Wednesday, Papandreou left a hospital after 13 days oftreatment for pneumonia and kidney failure. Accompanied by hisgirlfriend, Dmitra Liani, he went to the Parliament building to besworn in as a deputy to serve as opposition leader. He kept his seatin the June 18 elections.   The banking scandal involves the $200 million embezzlement andfraud affair involving fugitive banker George Koskotas. The formerBank of Crete chairman, in a U.S. jail pending a hearing for hisextradition to Greece, accused the Socialist administration ofmasterminding and authorizing the fraud.   Koskotas, accused of using the bank funds to build a publishingempire and to buy a top Greek soccer team, has said in interviewsfrom jail that Socialist officials, including Papandreou, receivedbribes from him.   Kanellopoulos said the purchase of warplanes from the UnitedStates and France will be investigated. Socialist officials havebeen accused of receiving kickbacks from Greece's purchase of 40F-16 and 40 Mirage 2000 jet fighters.   He said the government also will look into the case of Yugoslavcorn sold as a Greek product to European Economic Communitycountries and alleged widespread wiretapping by the state-run GreekTelecommunications Organization.   Justice Minister Fotis Kouvelis said Tuesday that the cleansingcould be hampered by the lack of documents in ministries.   Ministers who took over this week said they found confidentialfiles missing from their Socialist predecessors' offices.   Tzannetakis said he could not find a single file in Papandreou'soffice.   The new premier said he was told by one of Papandreou's advisorsthat ``when problems were solved we tore up the documents. Thereforethere are no documents, we solved all problems.''   Kanellopoulos said the government would investigate why the fileswere missing.   Papandreou failed to win a third term in office when hisPanhellenic Socialist Movement won only 125 seats in the 300-seatunicameral Parliament. New Democracy won 145 seats and theCommunists won 28. The remainder went to a small conservative partyand an independent.</TEXT></DOC>
