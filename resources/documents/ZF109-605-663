made its debut in June of 1984, it wasn't exactly inresponse to readers' demands, but as the editor then put it, &quot;They need toknow about computer law, even though they don't yet realize they do.&quot;andP;  Whatneither he nor I had anticipated was that the column would still be runningsix years later.andP;  We contemplated a series of a half-dozen articles--at mosta dozen--that in everyday language would sketch the outlines of the legalframework that was emerging for computing.andP;  This, as we saw it, wouldsufficiently take care of the job.andM;Over the first ten months we surveyed legal terrain at a dizzying pace: therewere columns on copyrights, trade secrets, and patents; on the concept ofderivative works; on legal barriers to software portability; on the US courtand legal systems; on the landmark Court of Appeals copyright decision inApple Computer vs.andP;  Franklin Computer, and on potential legal headachesarising from product liability or from the activities of former employees.andO;Now, as I re-read these early articles, I'm struck by how many questions wereraised, and how few answers could then be provided.andM;Six years later, we do have some answers.andP;  The trouble is, the number ofuncertainties is multiplying faster than are the available answers.andP;  Andthough today there is a general awareness among the computing community thatwhat you don't know about the law can hurt you, the innocent indifference ofonly a few years now has given way to alarm concerning the proliferation ofwhat are viewed as unreasonable legal constraints on the industry.andP;  Or, asthe head of the California Public Utilities Commission was quoted by the SanFrancisco Chronicle as having recently observed, &quot;Once this [new technology]gets in the hands of the lawyers, none [of it] will be left for us to be ableto use.&quot;andM;While I'd like to think that none of my readers at this point would bemuttering, &quot;It's the fault of the lawyers,&quot; on the basis of comments Ifrequently encounter I suspect that I wish in vain.andP;  Perhaps it's time forone of those cranky sort of columns in which I felt my own opinions flap inthe breeze.andP;  (Readers who have a tendency to develop sore toes may considerthemselves warned.)andM;To start with, I guess we're going to have to look at a few of thewidely-held misconceptions concerning lawyers.andP;  As will become apparent lateron, I do have my own criticisms regarding the profession.andP;  But there's littleto be gained by trashing lawyers on the basis of fallacious--ifpopular--beliefs.andP;  Let's do it right.andM;Here, then, are three of the most persistent myths respecting the role oflawyers in molding the laws and regulations that circumscribe our activities.andM;Myth number 1: Our laws are written chiefly for the benefit of lawyers, sincemost of our legislators are members of that profession.andM;This I suppose we could label the &quot;conspiracy&quot; explanation for thefrustrating uncertainty and complexity of our laws--the laws controllingintellectual property being a prime example.andP;  Like most conspiracy theories,this one doesn't hold up under the facts.andP;  In actuality, the number oflawyers in the legislative sector has steadily been declining, so that by1987-88 only 42 percent of the members of the House of Representatives listed&quot;attorney&quot; as their profession.andP;  It is true that in the more traditional,more slowly evolving Senate the lawyers have kept a 3-2 edge, but even hereyou have to consider just what the label &quot;attorney&quot; may signify.andM;Many people still obtain law degrees without ever once intending to counsel aclient or venture into court.andP;  It is--or at least used to be--a reasonablyprestigeous title, more acceptable in egalitarian, work-ethic America thanhaving to acknowledge that one's real vocation is clipping coupons orspending an inheritance.andP;  Whatever an individual's motivation for obtaining aprofessional degree that may never be used, there's little community ofinterest between this group of &quot;attorneys&quot; and the members of the workingbar.andM;This brings us to the heart of the matter.andP;  When legislatures met onlysporadically, it was convenient to combine a career in law with legislativeservice.andP;  And in some states--not those that are commercialheavyweights--legislature still convene for just a limited number of weeksevery other year.andP;  But elsewhere, legislatures are in session during thegreater part of the year, and being a legislator has become a full-time job.andO;It's next to impossible to combine this kind of activity with the demands ofa general law practice--or, indeed, any other type of profit-making business,which may explain why a large number of legislators these days list theiroccupation as &quot;educator.&quot;andM;The ultimate result can be seen in California, which was a pioneer in theconcept of the full-time state legislature, richly supplied with professionalstaff and assistants, and with everyone involved well-compensated.andP;  Lawyershave been a declining minority in California's legislature for some years;taking their place has been a new breed, whom I will call legislativeprofessionals.andP;  A pattern now has emerged: when a legislator steps down, hisor her replacement is apt to be a designated staff member who has beengroomed as heir.andP;  This individual probably will have a university degree, butit's as likely to be in political science or social work as law.andP;  And theodds are that the successor's working experience will have been entirelywithin the legislative sphere.andM;Oh yes, I'm aware that a number of prominent politicians maintainaffiliations with &quot;power&quot; law firms.andP;  To characterize this in the mostfavorable light possible, their services to the firm are likely to be in thenature of those of a consultant or legislative liaison, not the performanceof nuts-and-bolts legal drudge work.andM;Myth number 2: Lawyers create complications and instigate litigation, inorder to have a lot of work for which they can charge.andM;It's been said that most stereotypes contain a certain element of truth, inthat it's possible to find some individuals who fit.andP;  So yes, what used to becalled ambulance chasing has always been with us, and yes, I've met my shareof greedy lawyers.andP;  Whether they now constitute a bigger percentage I can'tsay, but the mere fact that there are many more lawyers today than there wereonly a few years ago dictates that there are bound to be more bad apples.andM;That having been said, most established lawyers find that they have more thanenough to do without resorting to such stratagems.andP;  Their chief complaint isthat they can't keep up with the work demands upon them, which has spawned awhole mini-industry within the profession, dedicated to helping practitionersmake more efficient use of their time and resources.andP;  Time-budgeting,automated research, and computerization of office functions all figure inthis, yet a common complaint of lawyers is that they're victims of burnout.andM;It shouldn't be surprising, then, that the legal profession is often in theforefront of efforts to simplify procedures, standardize paperwork--oncourt-approved forms where possible--and, surprisingly, shift routine legalchores from lawyers to non-lawyers.andP;  Even an activist group like HALT (HelpAbolish Legal Tyranny) has found a receptive ear for its proposals in somelegal quarters, although the response from the profession has been far fromuniform.andM;The truth is that conscientious practitioners dread the thought of theirclients becoming involved in messy litigation, and do whatever they can toavoid it.andP;  One source of repeated frustration for lawyers consists of clientswho don't consult them until after they've taken some course of action thatmay have draconian legal consequences.andP;  It's no easier to unscramble an eggin a law office than it is in a kitchen.andP;  (If you want to save money on yourlegal fees, see your lawyer before you sign that lease, contract, oragreement.)andM;Myth number 3: Lawyers are primarily concerned with furthering the interestsof the rich and powerful, because they identify with this group.andM;Well, relatively few lawyers do make a great deal of money, but for everycorporate general counsel who pulls down an annual salary of a half million,there are scores of attorneys who never get beyond a niche in the beleaguredmiddle class.andP;  And I've seen some rather well-known lawyers appearing incourt in decidedly threadbare clothing.andM;What attracts the public's attention, unfortunately, are the flamboyantcelebrity attorneys whose comings and goings are geared toward maximum mediaexposure.andP;  Never mind that sometimes it's a long spell between the big feepayments in their spectacular cases, so that their office staff goes formonths without pay, or that some of these practitioners have been throughtheir share of bankruptcies.andP;  That's the side the public rarely gets to see.andM;What has to be kept in mind is that unless they can relieve themselves of theneed to earn a living by means of an inheritance or a lucky hit in stocks orreal estate, most practicing lawyers have little choice but to serve as hiredguns.andP;  This means working for someone who can afford to pay them, of course,which isn't the little guy.andP;  Whatever private opinions a lawyer may hold, heor she is obligated to hold the interests of the client paramount, subject,of course, to the limitations imposed by professional ethics.andM;As a result, although I have no reason to believe that lawyers as a group aresignificantly more conservative, or liberal, or tradition-bound, orworshipful or disdainful of privilege and wealth than other groups of similareducational status, there does exist a well-documented imbalance in theavailability of legal services across the economic spectrum in the US.andP;  Andamong those most concerned about this state of affairs are the lawyers.andO;However, the problem runs a lot deeper in our society than just the its legalsystem, and it's ludicrous to suggest, as some do, that the situation's beencontrived by the lawyers for their own benefit.andM;Having now gone on at some length about what lawyers shouldn't properly catchthe blame for, it's only fair that I give equal time to some areas in which Ibelieve the profession does merit criticism, though I'm aware that thesecomments won't please some of my erstwhile colleagues:andM;Criticism number 1: Far too many lawyers today simply lack essentialcompetence.andM;This statement eludes quantification, of course.andP;  The irrefutable evidencefor it lies in the sorry fact that courts and bar organizations from coast tocoast are overwhelmed by having to deal with a growing number of instances ofattorney misfeasance--or, frequently, nonfeasance.andP;  Professional journalsoverflow with anguished dissections of the likely cause for this, but Isuspect there are a multiplicity of them.andP;  One is simply the explosive growthin the number of lawyers, with the result that there aren't enoughexperienced hands around to provide the sort of informal tutleage for newpractitioners that was commonplace when I first entered practice.andM;Still, and this is strictly my own view, I think the law schools must beviewed as major culprits.andP;  Too many of them have succumbed to theblandishments of growth--recruiting more and more students--and therebycreating more, and better paying, positions for faculty and administrators.andO;New buildings go up, and must be kept filled.andM;There's little attempt, so far as I can tell, to dissuade persons who aren'ttempermentally or intellectually suited to be lawyers from entering theprofession (though once they get into practice, it's not difficult to discernwho they are).andP;  Moreover, from my experience as a judge, I can testify thatappalling numbers of lawyers are graduated from top-name schools who don'tknow anything about the rules of evidence--to cite an example.andP;  (My surmiseis that what they do know, they've picked up by watching L.A.andP;  Law.)andM;Finally, throw in the fact that the law has now splintered into manydisparate areas of expertise, all of them demanding detailed knowledge tonegotiate successfully.andP;  Now introduce our undertrained, perhaps unmotivated,practitioners and it's not difficult to see why so many lawyers findthemselves involved in matters for which they're not qualified.andM;Criticism number 2: Too many lawyers communicate poorly.andM;I don't think this needs much explanation; everyone who deals with enoughlawyers discovers this.andP;  But it isn't just the way lawyers expressthemselves; often they don't have enough time to explain things in anunderstandable fashion.andP;  And clients are not blameless either; theunfortunate human tendency to ignore things we don't wish to hear often is afactor.andP;  Still, it's the lawyers job to deliver even bad news, no matter howlong it takes, and too many of them habitually fail in that obligation.andM;Criticism number 3: Lawyers tend to be too isolated from the society atlarge.andM;This isn't universally the case, and there are signs it may be diminishing.andO;Nevertheless, if you examine a typical group of lawyers, you'll most likelyfind that their close friends and confidants are other lawyers.andP;  This startsearly, in law school, where outside interests are strongly frowned upon.andP;  Andonce in practice, lawyers frequently find themselves severely limited inselecting friends, because often the only people with whom they're in dailycontact that they can deal with as peers are other lawyers.andM;Whatever the causes, their intellectual isolation makes lawyers seemunsympathetic and distant, little caring about the real concerns of peoplewho have their acts together and don't need to get sprung from jail orrescued from botched-up business deals.andP;  Perhaps it would help if everyonewould resolve to take a lawyer to lunch once a month.andP;  Some of them, atleast, are capable of being civilized.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
