The last car rolled off the factory line Friday after 42 yearsin production, and the finale took place in Portugal, where Citroenmoved production after shutting down its Levallois assembly linenear Paris.   There were no public ceremonies at the Mangualde factory, ``justa little get-together for the workers who have been making them,''said a Citroen Lusitania spokesman, Teixeira de Abreu.   But Citroen fans worldwide will mourn the demise of theturtle-shaped Deux Chevaux _ named literally for ``two horses,'' orthe horsepower produced by its chugging air-cooled engine.   It was officially designated the 2CV and came with open-flapside-windows, mattress-like suspension and scrawny tires. More than3.86 million were sold since the launch at the 1948 Paris Auto showfor $650.   Including a van, more comfortable Ami and Dyane versions, andeven a four-wheel drive derivative, more than 7 million DeuxChevaux have hit the roads. Thousands of fans have set up about 300owners' clubs worldwide.   Citroen's hi-tech AX compact will substitute the 2CV at theMangualde plant. But, according to Gavin Green, chief editor ofBritain's Car Magazine, ``no car will replace it _ there's nosuccessor in sight. It's the end of an era.''   He says most owners have an emotional relationship with their2CV that, like the Volkswagen Beetle and the British-made Mini, hasbecome a motoring legend.   In 1935, Citroen boss Pierre-Jules Boulanger asked his designersto dream up a small, avant-garde car for all classes of folk thatwould be like ``a four-wheeled sofa covered by an umbrella.''   Boulanger demanded enough headroom for an opera-bound gentlemanwearing a top hat, but also a car supple enough to transport atleast two peasants with a basket of eggs across a ploughed fieldwithout smashing their fragile cargo. All that without using morethan about 2.4 gallons of fuel for 60 miles.   The first wooden mock-ups had one headlamp, a serrated hood thatlooked like a cheese grater. Functional interior appointmentsincluded a roll-back canvas roof, a hand-operated windshield wiperand hammock seats.   When World War II broke out in 1939, Boulanger had all but oneof the 250 running prototypes destroyed. He hid the survivor in abarn.   Available only in gray at the 1948 Paris launch, the DeuxChevaux could manage a top speed of 37 mph. Sales soon rocketed andin 1950, the waiting list was six years long.   Sales began to slacken in the mid-1980s. The 2CV can no longermeet emission laws in Switzerland and Austria, nor safetyregulations in Sweden and Finland.   But Green is convinced that life could have begun at 40 for thecar that still has a loyal clientele in France, Britain, WestGermany, Belgium and Ireland.   ``Sales are only dropping because Citroen isn't advertising _there's no genuine reason to kill the car. I think they're a bitembarrassed by it not fitting their hi-tech image.''</TEXT></DOC>
