The bond market has become increasingly attractive in recent weeks as yields on some long-term Treasurys have hovered around 9%. Meanwhile, higher interest rates and threats of growing inflation have unnerved some stock market investors and sent prices broadly lower in five of the past seven sessions.    &quot;The dilemma everyone is facing is whether the bond market is in the middle of a surge that's going to plateau or retreat,&quot; said Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;We feel the overall reward for the equity market isn't particularly attractive, but we also feel it's a little premature to become more aggressive with bonds. We don't think you can make any long-term bets at all right now.&quot;    In earlier years, the choice between bonds and stocks was sometimes simplified by investors' perception that bonds were &quot;safe&quot; compared with equities. No more. &quot;Starting in 1974 with the first oil crisis, the bond market became about as volatile as the stock market,&quot; said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist with Data Resources in Lexington, Mass., an economic consulting company. &quot;The days of stable interest rates are past.&quot;    But volatility isn't the only safety consideration. &quot;If you're going to hold a bond to maturity, you know exactly what you're going to get in nominal terms,&quot; said Mr. Wyss. &quot;You don't know where the stock will be in 10 years. Of course, you also don't know about inflation.&quot;    Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said that unless long-term investors are &quot;really concerned&quot; about a significant upturn in inflation, they should consider 9% a very good rate of return. &quot;With 4% or 5% inflation,&quot; he said, a return of 4% or 5% beyond inflation &quot;would historically be very high. Historically, 3% has been considered a decent return.&quot;    John Connolly, investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes the bond market at its current level should be stiffer competition for the stock market than it has been so far. &quot;It makes sense to sell some stocks -- sell some risk -- now,&quot; he said. The yield on Standard andamp; Poor's 400-stock industrial index based on estimated 1987 earnings is around 2.5%. &quot;I can get 800 basis points more from the same company in the bond rather than the stock,&quot; he said. &quot;So it looks like there's either going to be a huge bond market rally, or the stock market is going to go down.&quot;    Mr. Wyss of Data Resources doesn't believe that a 9% long-bond yield is a threat to the stock market. &quot;The stock market is already discounting 9%, but if we start talking about 10%, that's a threat,&quot; he said. &quot;Every percentage point on the bond yield gives you something like 200 points on the Dow.&quot;    Mr. Connolly disagrees. &quot;You don't have to get to 10%,&quot; he said. &quot;All you have to do is stay at current levels for some period of time so the stock market gets the notion that these returns are going to be around for a while. At these levels, some people are going to be forced to look at their asset allocation decisions.&quot;    So is this a good time for stock investors to consider putting stock profits into the bond market?    &quot;The answer to that is ifs, buts and maybes,&quot; said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. &quot;The bond market could represent something of a buying opportunity right now,&quot; he said. &quot;The current yield probably anticipates as high, or even higher, inflation and a more vigorous economy than I think we're likely to encounter. So I'd say there's a fifty-fifty or better chance that rates will ease a little toward the end of the year. But people should remember that interest rates are no longer determined by domestic economic considerations. They're increasingly influenced by international economic developments.&quot;    Even those, like Mr. Connolly, who like bonds better than stocks right now, aren't advising investors to bet the farm on the bond market. &quot;We prefer bonds to stocks, but we prefer cash to bonds,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess that's the definition of being a bear.&quot;    Those who decide to stick out this period in the stock market should be increasingly selective about their holdings, analysts agree. &quot;We're looking for companies with very strong comparative earnings -- however they get them,&quot; said Mr. Miller.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices advanced in quiet trading as many investors left early for the Memorial Day weekend. Traders attributed most of the market's gain to the day's strong bond market and to a report showing that consumer prices rose 0.4% in April.    &quot;The fear of inflation started to wane today,&quot; said Peter Furniss, managing director of Smith Barney, Harris Upham.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 17.43 points to 2243.20 on volume of only 135.8 million shares, the third slowest day of the year. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index advanced 1.99 to 282.16, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 0.98 to 159.05. There were 893 advancing issues and 648 declining issues.    For the week, the industrial average lost 29 1/2 points.    In the over-the-counter market, some computer stocks, which had been leading the market higher, fell. Sun Microsystems moved down 1 5/8 to 40, while Microsoft lost 3 1/4 to 108 1/4. But on the Big Board, Digital Equipment jumped 5 1/2 to 155 after analysts at several brokerage firms recommended the stock. </TEXT></DOC>
