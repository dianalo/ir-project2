Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, said Thursday.   The deal involves 315 M-1 A-2 tanks, and should be finalized bythe end of the year, Oxley said.   General Dynamics Corp. will build the tanks if the arrangementis completed. By law, Congress must have the chance to say no tothe sale.   If it goes through, the deal will increase production by 20percent at General Dynamics' its Lima, Ohio, facility, Oxley said.   The congressman said General Dynamics hadn't been counting onlanding the Saudi business.   ``Clearly there are always sensitive issues when you're talkingabout military sales to Arab states, even moderate Arab states,''Oxley said.   Before approving the sale the administration had to be convincedthe new generation of M-1 tanks were vital to Saudi Arabia'sdefense, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
