 The company hasbeen taking advantage of the fact that NewWave and NewWave Office areavailable today, and the customers can actually begin pilot efforts to testthe success of HP's NewWave strategy and products in solving businessproblems.andM;HP recently made some new announcements to enhance NewWave capabilities andclarigy time frames for future products.andP;  The company also emphasizes thefact that its NewWave products are consistently shipping on time.andP;  Here isthe latest update on NewWave Office servers, client software, and services.andM;SERVER UPDATE.andP;  HP will add Unix/386 to MPE, HP-UX, and OS/2 as a NewWaveOffice server platform.andP;  HP has also announced enhancements to all of itscurrent server platforms.andM;Unix/386.andP;  HP has always intended to port OpenMail to Unix/386 (see&quot;OpenMail&quot; below) and will now expand its offering on this platform to afull-blown version of NewWave Office by mid-1991.andP;  In addition to mail, thiswill include shared resources (available now through LAN Manager/X andNewWave for DOS), network object-sharing, networked PC management, and someform of Information Access.andM;HP sees tremendous demand for the 386 Unix platform, certainly more than forOS/2.andP;  One major benefit will be a scalable solution for Unix starting at the386 level up through the HP9000/800 series.andP;  HP anticipates that NewWaveOffice for Unix/386 will be available through its dealer channel as well asdirectly from HP.andM;OS/2 Enhancements.andP;  HP has recently committed to implementing networked PCmanagement on its OS/2 server platform.andP;  This was the one missing piece onOS/2 in the original NewWave Office announcement.andP;  NewWave Office for OS/2will now be fully equivalent to NewWave Office for MPE and Unix, with all thesame office services.andP;  The full OS/2 version will be available by mid-'91.andO;Components that will be available earlier on OS/2 include network objectsharing (available now through LAN Manager and NewWave on DOS) andInformation Access (targeted for November).andP;  Information Access will workinitially with DOS and OS/2 database products such as dBase and R:base.andM;LAN Manager for MPE.andP;  HP will implement HP LAN Manager/XL (Named Pipes) onits MPE platform by the end of March 1991.andP;  The benefit here is use of theLAN Manager APIs.andP;  HP intends to rewrite all of its transport code forclient/server applications for Named Pipes, including information Access andNewWave Mail.andP;  By developing one strategic implementation on Pipes, HPreduces its development effort in deploying the applications on multipleserver platforms.andM;Portable NetWare.andP;  In the first quarter of 1991, NewWave Office will supportNovell's portable NetWare on both its Unix and MPE servers.andP;  This will allowa Novell PC LAN to plug directly into an HP3000/MPE of HP9000/HP-UX NewWaveOffice server without a bridge.andP;  The advantage here is access to morepowerful servers (especially for large database applications) and portability(using the Novell APIs means support for multiple servers without having tochange the client software).andP;  HP states that there are a number of VARs whowant to write Novell server applications on the Unix platform in particularto accomplish one or both of these objectives.andM;CLIENT SOFTWARE.andP;  The NewWave desktop software is the front-end clientsoftware for NewWave Office that provides the iconic/graphical userinterface, Object Management Facility (OMF), and the Agent facility.andP;  Thisstill runs only on DOS.andP;  The developer's kits for the NewWave desktopenvironment on Unix (OSF/Motif) and OS/2 (Presentation Manager) will ship inthe first quarter of 1991.andP;  We would expect to see the end-user NewWavesoftware on these platforms six to nine months later.andP;  These will be thedistributed versions of NewWave, using Network Computing System (NCS) as thecore technology.andP;  HP will implement a full distributed solution on Unix; OS/2will involve a phased approach, with at least some distributed componentsinitially and the infrastructure to fully support distributed objects in thefuture.andM;HP expects development of NewWave applications on both Unix and OS/2 to rampup much faster than on DOS.andP;  One reason is the excellent acceptance ofNewWave on DOS and the fact that HP will not have to spend as much time andenergy educating developers on the benefits of NewWave.andP;  Committing toNewWave on DOS also required a commitment to Microsoft Windows.andP;  Until theintroduction of Windows 3.0, some of the larger DOS software vendors weretorn between Windows and OS/2, and reluctant to commit to Windows.andO;Developing for NewWave on Unix and OS/2 does not entail the samegut-wrenching decision, since Motif and PM are pretty much givens on thoseplatforms.andM;Information Access.andP;  HP's promised NewWave Information Access client will bedelivered by the end of this year.andP;  Currently, Information Access is anencapsulated application on the NewWave desktop.andP;  One significant benefit ofthe NewWave version will be the ability to use Agent tasks to storerepetitive queries and to integrate query results with reports, spreadsheets,etc.andM;NewWave Mail.andP;  NewWave Mail, which provides a full graphical NewWave userinterface to the electronic mail system, is currently available for the MPENewWave Office server, connecting to the DeskManager mail transport.andP;  HP hasalso announced that the NewWave Mail client will be available for the UnixOpenMail server as well.andP;  This is in Beta test now.andM;NewWave AdvanceLink.andP;  AdvanceLink is HP's terminal emulator for accessinghost applications.andP;  A NewWave version of AdvanceLink (on DOS only, initially)will be available for both Unix and MPE servers in the first quarter of '91.andO;In addition to the terminal emulation capability AdvanceLink has alwaysprovided, this graphical user interface will add the following capabilities:andM;* The ability to include host applications in Agent tasksandM;* Cut-and-paste data transfer between host applications and otherapplications on the NewWave desktopandM;* The ability to execute a file transfer to the host simply by picking up anobject on the desktop and dropping it on the terminal emulator iconandM;NewWave AdvanceLink will also have a more robust command language fordeveloping programs that involve host applications.andP;  HP sees the systemadministrator using this to write terminal emulation porgrams and deployingthem to end users.andP;  The bottom line here is additional support from HP tolink existing applications into the NewWave environment without having torewrite these applications.andM;Mac Connections.andP;  Terminal emulation access to NewWave Office for Apple'sMacintosh is already shipping.andP;  Coming by the end of this year will befile-sharing and print-sharing via Pacer for Macs connected to HP Unixservers.andP;  The Pacer software will make the HP-UX server look like anAppleTalk server to the Mac.andM;OFFICE SERVICES UPDATE.andP;  New office services--an image applicationdevelopment platform and a fax gateway--are now available for NewWave Office.andO;Significant enhancements to network PC management are coming, and OpenMailwill shortly begin its migration to non-HP Unix platforms.andM;Image Arrives.andP;  HP's first NewWave Office document service, Advanced ImageManagement System (aims), is now available on HP-UX.andP;  HP AIMS is a toolkitfor creating image-capable applications that includes a 4GL and auser-interface builder.andP;  Currently, the front end runs on DOS and the serveron the HP9000 (HP-UX), with support for SCO Unix/386 coming.andP;  The clientsoftware is encapsulated and will be a full NewWave application in thefuture.andM;HP states that 10 VARs, including Arthur Andersen, have already signed up forAIMS development, and that 12 customers have systems installed.andM;Future enhancements to AIMS (by the end of this year) include:andM;* Software decompression.andP;  Images are sent accross the network in compressedform to reduce the load on the LAN, and compression/decompression iscurrently handled by a hardware board in the PC workstation.andP;  With softwaredecompression, a PC without the board will be able to view the image as wellas convert it to a format that the PC can manipulated, such as TIFF.andP;  Theonly limitation will be that a PC without the board cannot send the imageback through the network because the board is required for recompression.andM;* SCO Unix/386 support.andM;* Fax support (through HP OfficeFax; see &quot;Fax Gateway&quot; below).andM;* HP ScanJet and LaserJet support (for input/output) with the addition of newdrivers.andM;* OCR support through third-party card (Calera).andM;* Support for HP's new rewritable optical disk, providing large storagecapacity for images.andM;Fax Gateway.andP;  HP OfficeFax is a new server that provides access to faxservices for any mail user on the network.andP;  The fax server consists of aboard (Gammafax CPT fax card) and the HP OfficeFax software installed on adedicated PC (minimum is an AT-compatible).andP;  The server can connect to eitherOpenMail on HP-UX of DeskManager on MPE.andP;  To the mail transport, the faxserver looks just like another remote user to which mail is routed.andM;There are two benefits here.andP;  One is the ability to get network fax servicesthrough a single fax gateway.andP;  Another is the fact that any mail user on thenetwork--including those on terminals and Macs--can access this fax server.andM;Electronic outbound fax material (text and graphics) can be sent directly tothe server by any user on the network.andP;  Incoming faxes are converted to TIFFformat and can be automatically stored, printed (on LaserJet or DeskJet forhigh quality output), or routed to the administrator for furtherhandling/routing.andP;  Faxes then routed to a PC user can be viewed, printed, orconverted to an ASCII format if the user has software that handles TIFFfiles.andP;  The administrator must handle all incoming faxes for terminal users(i.e., print and distribute, or route the fax to the user's printer).andM;Additional features include the ability to send any outgoing documents toboth facsimile machines and HP mail addresses simultaneously, the ability tospecify a time for sending the fax, automatic addition of a cover sheet,redial capabilities for busy phone lines, and confirmation of successful andunsuccessful fax transmissions.andP;  HP also provides administrative functionsand a full tracking system for fax traffic sent through the server.andM;As soon as OpenMail is available on platforms other than HP-UX, the HPOfficeFax server can be connected as well.andP;  The HP OfficeFax software costs$6,000; both the board and software are available now.andM;Network PC Management.andP;  Currently, all NewWave Office client components(e.g., the NewWave environment and NewWave Mail) can be transparentlyinstalled from the server by the system administrator.andP;  The next enhancementis to enable the administrator to transparently install third-party clientsoftware on the network.andP;  The administrator will package up the software,store it on the server, and indicate which and/or how many users can accessthe software.andP;  End users will then be able to access the Workstation Managerand see what third-party software they have access to.andP;  When a user picks athird-party program, NewWave Office will download the software to the user'sworkstation and configure it as appropriate.andP;  It will also keep track in adatabase of the number of copies in use and limit the number of users to thatauthorized by the administrator.andM;Transparent network installation of third-party software will be available onUnix and MPE servers by March 1991.andP;  It will also be implemented on theUnix/386 and OS/2 servers.andP;  The Workstation Manager is designed by HP to beserver-independent (as is network object storage), enabling the company toeasily move it to other operating platforms.andM;The Workstation Manager will not initially use the HP/Apollo Network LicenseService (NLS) since NLS is currently only available on Unix and doesn'thandle the downloading of software to the PC.andP;  Merging the WorkstationManager with NLS is the next step, and this will most likely occur late nextyear.andM;OpenMail.andP;  HP is continuing its efforts with Uniplex to port HP's OpenMail toother Unix platforms.andP;  The objective is to make OpenMail the de facto Unixmail system.andP;  OpenMail will be available on IBM'S AIX, Apollo Domain, SCOUnix/386, and Xenix/386 by the end of this year.andP;  Targeted for implementationin 1991 are Sun 3, Bull xps, Digital Ultrix, Pyramid 3X, ATandamp;T, MIPS 120 NCRTower, Altos 2000, and Convergent Technologies.andM;NEW DEVELOPERS.andP;  HP states that 16 additional VARs (for a total of 24) and 18new ISVs (for a total of 119) have now committed to developing NewWaveapplications.andP;  New customer accounts include Spalding Sports, Rich'sDepartment Stores, Hughes Aircraft, and Hercules incorporated.andM;HP has developed an approach to piloting NewWave in customer accounts thatfocuses on two major steps: identifying a business problem for a group of 20people or less, and developing a set of metrics to measure NewWave's successover a period of three months.andP;  HP then sends a team in to assist in thepilot process.andP;  A major objective is to end up with information that enablesthe customer to cost-justify the implementation of NewWave.andP;  HP is findingthis approach very successful.andM;SUMMARY.andP;  HP is rolling out a comprehensive product line to implement itsNewWave office strategy.andP;  The key advantage here is the fact that enough ofthe products are available today to allow customers to seriously experimentwith solving real business problems.andP;  Although some necessary pieces arestill missing--such as distributed object management, NewWave client softwareon Unix and OS/2, and workgroup applications like calendar/schedulingservices--all are on the docket for future implementation.andP;  And developersupport, while not yet overwhelming, is growing steadily.andP;  All of this pointsto a solid foundation on which HP can continue to build and gain experience.andO;And we all know the value of experience in developing a true understanding ofuser requirements and tailoring products to provide appropriate solutions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
