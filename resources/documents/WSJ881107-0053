Times have changed.    Five years of a real estate depression in the Southwest and of severe overbuilding in many other areas have left the industry in shock.    Many in the industry have reached a gloomy new conclusion. The commercial development business isn't merely in a cyclical downturn, they say. Rather, the industry has gotten too big and is unlikely to return -- perhaps for a generation -- to the booming, build-on-the-run days of the recent past.    Pessimism was evident last week as 4,000 people gathered for a meeting of the Urban Land Institute, the real estate industry's semiannual bash.    &quot;The development business is shrinking; that's what scares people,&quot; says James Noteware, who heads the real estate practice of Laventhol andamp; Horwath, an accounting firm. &quot;We have too many buildings and too many people in the business of developing them.&quot;    &quot;The industry has radically changed,&quot; says David Agnew, a Denver land developer who has reduced his staff by 30%. &quot;In the old days you could hardly miss with any project,&quot; or so it seemed, he says. But today &quot;the financing isn't available. The deals are smaller and more selective.&quot;    Mr. Agnew recognizes that such restraint may make the industry stronger in the future. &quot;The question,&quot; he says, &quot;is who's going to be around?&quot;    Development companies are scaling back on building, reducing staffs and diversifying into businesses -- such as portfolio management -- that don't involve bricks and mortar. When they do build, it is increasingly as hired hands, not risk-taking entrepreneurs.    &quot;The attitude is different,&quot; says John Gould, a former real estate loan officer for a failed Philadelphia savings and loan. &quot;The gunslingers are gone.&quot;    The ULI conference was famed in the past as an event where big guns could meet to plan big projects. This time, people were talking about the routine business of property management. They flocked to hear panel discussions such as &quot;Asset Management: Restructuring a Poorly Performing Institutional Portfolio.&quot; The stars of the meeting seemed to be people once on the periphery of real estate: investment bankers and advisers to pension funds.    This reflects the industry's shift away from development. The emphasis now is on investing, management and financial restructuring.    Despite the overbuilding, pension funds have a healthy appetite for buying secure, well-located properties. The business of managing fund money is booming.    Wall Street is doing ever more work for corporations wanting to realize the value of real estate through refinancings and sales. Last week, Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. announced that it was putting its 110-story headquarters up for sale as part of an effort to boost its share price.    Developers are trying to stay afloat by switching skills. &quot;A lot of developers are trying to get into investing and asset management,&quot; says James Phillips, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, a search firm specializing in real estate. Developers who struck off on their own during good times now find themselves out of work, Mr. Phillips says.    Some are leaving the industry. The head of the Denver office of a national developer quit and went into cattle ranching, says Thomas McCahill, a real estate vice president in Englewood, Col., for MONY Financial Services.    Office construction in 1988 will be an estimated 75 million square feet, down 27% from 1987, according to Cushman andamp; Wakefield, the New York commercial real estate broker.    Despite the generally booming economy, 15% of the office space in cities and 21% of the space in suburbs is vacant, Cushman says.    And the long-term demographics for real estate aren't good. &quot;The labor market expansion of 1975-85 is over,&quot; Leanne Lachman, managing director of Schroder Real Estate Associates, wrote in a report that was widely discussed at ULI.    The maturity of baby boomers, she says, means that &quot;the big wave of first-time home buyers&quot; and of new office workers is tapering off. &quot;Clearly, the development pace of the 1980s has run its course.&quot;    To be sure, areas such as Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles and much of the West Coast remain hot for development. &quot;Everybody wants a piece of the LA market&quot; because of its links to the Pacific Rim, says Charles Hill, a principal in Real Estate Capital Group, of Los Angeles.    Many developers are focusing on narrow, niche businesses such as rehabilitating old shopping malls. Glenn Isaacson, a West Coast developer, says overbuilding in major cities has left opportunities in &quot;secondary cities&quot; such as Oakland and Newark.    But developers are increasingly under the thumb of institutional lenders. Lenders rarely finance a project these days until it already has tenants committed. Jeffrey Gault, executive vice president of Home Savings of America, of Los Angeles, says developers can expect a &quot;draconian tightening&quot; of terms from bankers.    James Digney, senior vice president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., a speaker at a jammed ULI panel, asked: Does the developer still have a role, &quot;or is the institution squeezing him out?&quot; (His answer was that developers are needed to oversee land assembly, design and zoning. But until recently, no one would have dreamed of asking such a question.)    And at a ULI cocktail party, James Bronkema, a local developer, recalled that when Embarcadero Center, a big San Francisco office complex, was begun in the late 1960s, people were acutely nervous about whether it would be leased. After much jockeying with forecasts and figures, Trammell Crow, the Dallas developer and one of Embarcadero's founders, simply said: &quot;Let's do it.&quot;    Mr. Bronkema, chairman of Embarcadero, says the days of developers acting on impulse and instinct are largely gone. &quot;It used to be a developer could feel it when something was right,&quot; he says. &quot;It isn't as much fun anymore.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
