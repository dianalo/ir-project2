The president said bipartisanship is of the utmost importance ashe seeks support for his Persian Gulf policies and the massive U.S.military buildup in Saudi Arabia.   ``I'm grateful to the Democratic leadership for the support theyhave given,'' he told a fund-raising luncheon for gubernatorialcandidate George Voinovich. ``We need to ... continue to maintain abipartisan spirit in support of America's response to Iraqiaggression,'' he said.   He reiterated his feeling that politics should ``stop at thewater's edge'' when it comes to an international crisis.   The words were similar to what Bush has said many times sinceIraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But they contrasted sharply withthe blistering attack he had leveled against Democrats a momentbefore when he talked about the budget negotiations.   Acknowledging that ``emotions in this budget debate ... arerunning high,'' Bush launched into a tirade against Democrats inCongress who he accused of blocking an agreement to reduce thedeficit.   With Monday looming as the deadline to reach a deficit reductionagreement, Bush said that if failure to meet the deadline resultsin automatic spending cuts, the Democrats will be to blame for thehavoc that ensues, including massive government furloughs anddisruptions of services.   He insisted that it is not his demand for a capital gainsreduction tax that is holding up the process. Before leavingWashington, Bush met with Republican congressional leaders who saidthe president may be willing to compromise on his call for a cut inthe capital gains tax.   ``Contrary to what you may have heard, the hangup is not capitalgains,'' Bush said. ``The hangup is with the Democrats on CapitolHill.   ``It goes well beyond political rhetoric,'' he said. ``It isimportant to get a solution,'' he said.   On the political front, Bush gave Voinovich a resoundingendorsement as the candidate who would promote education and lawand order and environmental protection.   As mayor of Cleveland, Voinovich had taken the city from ``thegloomy dark days of despair'' and brought it into brighter times,Bush said.   Recent polls have shown Voinovich with a slight lead over theDemocratic nominee, state Attorney General Anthony J. CelebrezzeJr., in the race to succeed Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste.   The gubernatorial battle is one of several that is being hotlycontested by both parties as the reapportionment of congressionaldistricts looms.   From Akron today, Bush was heading to Illinois for a dinnerhonoring GOP Senate candidate Rep. Lynn Martin, who is in an uphillbattle against Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.   The president was spending tonight in Minneapolis, where he willattend a breakfast Thursday to benefit the gubernatorial bid ofpolitical newcomer Jon Grunseth. Grunseth, a St. Paul businessman,won a six-way Independent-Republican primary this month to faceincumbent Gov. Rudy Perpich.   Bush will return to Ohio on Thursday for a reception and lunchto benefit Voinovich in Cleveland. Then he will head to Detroit tostump for GOP Senate hopeful Rep. Bill Schuette, who is trying tooust Democratic Sen. Carl Levin.   As the November election nears, the president is committing oneto three days each week, with larger blocks of time expected at theend, to help GOP candidates.   He has used the trips as well to rally support for his hugemilitary deployment in the Persian Gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
