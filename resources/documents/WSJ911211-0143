Blue Bird, which was put up for sale this year in anauction run by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., attracted bids from fourother leveraged buy-out funds -- Travelers Corp.'s DillonRead Inc. unit, and units of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Hicksandamp; Muse, and Clayton andamp; Dubilier.</LP><TEXT>   The volume of leveraged buy-outs has declinedsubstantially in the past three years because of the lack ofavailable financing, both from banks and from the junk-bondmarket. The Blue Bird transaction is the fourth largestleveraged buy-out announced this year, according toSecurities Data Corp.   Officials of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, Merrill'sbuy-out unit, didn't return phone calls seeking comment. Thesale, first reported by Corporate Financing Week, an industrynewsletter, was announced yesterday.   Blue Bird, based in Fort Valley, Ga., is 94%-owned by bythe Luce family and 6%-owned by other employees. The companywas founded in 1927 by Albert Luce, whose sons Albert Jr., 69years old, and Joseph, 65, serve as co-chairmen.   The sale was triggered by the death of another Lucebrother, George, in July 1990. In an interview, Albert LuceJr. and Joseph Luce said they won't have any role in managingthe company after the buy-out. Members of the family's nextgeneration, they said, weren't interested in keeping thecompany.   The new management, which will have a chance to acquire a20% stake in the company, is expected to be led by PaulGlaske, the company's president. The Merrill buy-out fundwill own 80%.
