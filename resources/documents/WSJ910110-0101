I'm against them.</LP><TEXT>   I'm especially against handguns.   I'm against them because they are used to threaten, tomaim, to kill. I'm against them because today, if it istypical, 10 children will be killed by handguns.   I'm against them because this year about 3,000 teen-agers-- boys and girls -- will use handguns to kill themselves.Some 9,000 adults will do the same.   I'm against them because crooks -- from punks to mobsters-- will use handguns to kill another 9,200 people this year.All told, handguns account for more than 40% of all murdersin the U.S.   I'm against them because the major victims of handguncrimes are young, black males. Handguns further oppress theoppressed.   I'm against them because they cost this country $1 billiona year in medical care for the wounded.   Those are some of the reasons I'm against handguns. I canthink of others.   But I can't think of any reason to be for handguns.   Self-defense? Nope. If you keep a gun around the house,it's too likely to end up killing someone you love. Remember,more than a quarter of all teen-agers seriously think ofsuicide at some time; more than 10% actually try it, usuallyimpulsively. Those who try it with a gun almost alwayssucceed. Guns are used in 60% of teen suicides.   Sport? Target-shooting might be fun, but, then, why not doit at a licensed facility, instead of in your backyard, andwhy not use guns that are owned and controlled by thefacility -- sort of the way bowling alleys control thebowling balls. You don't need to own a handgun to enjoytarget-shooting.   Hunting? I'm not a hunter, but I can't believe thatkilling animals with a handgun is much sport. That seems tome to be the equivalent of clubbing baby seals.   What other legitimate reasons are there?   Men and women armed with handguns commit about 640,000crimes a year, according to the Bureau of Justice Statisticsat the U.S. Department of Justice. In 81,500 of those crimes,the victim is shot and injured. About 16,000 of those peopleare hospitalized for three weeks or longer.   &quot;While our thoughts are overseas, we seem almost blind tothe fact that there is a war going on right here in America-- on our nation's streets,&quot; says Sarah Brady, head of HangunControl Inc. &quot;There are 60 more body bags here in thiscountry, day in and day out. It's the American handgun war.&quot;   &quot;Some areas of the Persian Gulf today are safer forAmericans than some parts of New York City,&quot; Sterling JohnsonJr., the special narcotics prosecutor for New York City,wrote in the New York Times last Friday. And he added: &quot;Wecan stop the carnage by national gun-control legislation.&quot;   Does anyone want to? The answer is, overwhelmingly, yes. Ican't find a legitimate survey in which people oppose guncontrol. In sampling after sampling, as many as 95% of therespondents favor controls, especially waiting periods inwhich authorities can check out people wanting to buy guns.   But Congress won't pass -- or, at least, hasn't yet passed-- a strong gun-control law. Now, it has another chance. TheBrady Bill, named for the Mrs. Brady's husband James, thepress secretary who was shot and badly disabled in the Reaganassassination attempt, is again before Congress. It wouldrequire a seven-day &quot;cooling-off&quot; period for gun buyers,seven days in which police and hospital records could bechecked, seven days in which passions could cool, hatredscould ebb.   If you are a sane, law-abiding citizen and you want to buya gun today, why can't you wait until next Thursday to pickit up? You'd wait for a car, or a refrigerator, or a Diskman.Why not a handgun?   That doesn't seem too much to ask.   Indeed, it isn't enough. In fact, only police and soldiers-- and, maybe, licensed target ranges -- should havehandguns. No one else needs one.   Certainly, the 135,000 boys who daily carry handguns toschool don't need them.   Certainly, the 8.7 million youths who have access tohandguns don't need them. And certainly, the 12,000 rapistswho each year use guns to threaten their victims, the 9,200murderers, the 210,000 robbers, the 405,000 assaultersshouldn't have them.   Why should you and I have one?   Today, there are 60 million to 70 million handguns inprivate hands in the U.S. In the time it took you to readthis column, 50 more were manufactured. And two more peoplewere shot and injured.   I hope they weren't your family or friends.   ---   Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune inAmes, Iowa, and president of NBC News in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
