Police arelooking for Mekgwe.;    The case against Winnie Mandela rests almost entirelyon the testimony of Kgase, Mono and Mekgwe, who contend that they wereabducted and taken to the Mandela home Dec. 28, 1988, more than a year beforeNelson Mandela's release from years of imprisonment. The men testified inanother trial last year that Winnie Mandela had instigated the beatings ofthem and of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, who later was found dead of stabwounds.;    The attorney for Kgase and Mono argued that his clients' fearsamounted to a &quot;just excuse,&quot; which, under South African law, means they shouldbe allowed to refuse to testify.;    Judge Michael S. Stegmann said he would&quot;not make light of the fears expressed by the witnesses,&quot; and he described thekidnapping of Mekgwe as the work &quot;of a misguided and lawless person whointends to frustrate the ends of justice.&quot; But he threatened to imprison thedefendants if they did not testify.;    The two were saved from jailtemporarily by prosecutor Jan Swanepoel, who, citing their previouscooperation, asked the judge to withhold passing sentence and give the statetime to search for Mekgwe. Both Kgase and Mono have said they would testify ifMekgwe is found alive and well.;    Stegmann postponed the case until March 6.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Johannesburg, South Africa  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910215  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  343  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 15, 199100046100,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
