A national energy strategy that is motivated and guidedpurely by &quot;supply-side&quot; concerns is shortsighted and fails toaddress an equally important side of the energy equation --demand-side management. Indeed, oil and caribou probably canmix, but they needn't.</LP><TEXT>   Allen E. Grimes   Richmond, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
