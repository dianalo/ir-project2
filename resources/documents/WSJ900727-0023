The company said it is &quot;actively exploring&quot; thepossibility of acquiring a &quot;substantial amount&quot; of thepublicly traded, 15% deep-discount debentures it hasoutstanding and will seek amended terms on the remainder. Therefinancing is intended to lower the cosmetics company's debtcosts and ease some operating restrictions that came alongwith the borrowing.</LP><TEXT>   This fall, the company must start calling some of thosebonds at a cost of nearly $25 million a year, said a personfamiliar with the company's refinancing plans. Because ofthat, he said, company officials considered it an appropriatetime to refinance at a lower rate.   First Boston Corp. has been retained by Mary Kay as anadviser on the refinancing.   A spokesman for the company said the refinancing isn'trelated to the option Mary Kay holds to acquire 1.2 millionshares of Avon Products Inc. from financier Irwin Jacobs andAmway Corp. The company has a 45-day option, which began July5, the spokesman said, but can be extended.   Mary Kay owns a 25% stake in Chartwell Associates LimitedPartnership, which in turn is Avon's largest holder. If MaryKay, or another Chartwell partner buys the 1.2 million-shareblock, the group would then control 19.8% of Avon's votingshares.   Although the company could exercise the option without therefinancing, said the person familiar with Mary Kay's plans,transactions of that nature would be easier, both because ofthe anticipated easing of some operating restrictions andbecause of the improved balance sheet. For the time being, hesaid, any takeover ambitions on Chartwell's part have beenstymied by Avon's anti-takeover defenses, which are triggeredwhen a potential suitor acquires more than 20% of thecompany's stock.   Mary Kay has been portrayed as an LBO that worked. Thecompany, with its huge sales force, has doubled its operatingcash flow since the leveraged buy-out and has nearly doubledits sales. In 1989, the company spokesman said, sales weremore than $450 million, up from $255 million in 1986;operating cash flow has risen in that time to $72 millionfrom $35 million. The spokesman said that Mary Kay's salesforce also grew in that time, to nearly 200,000 from 140,000.   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investorsacquires a company in a transaction financed largely byborrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generatedby the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.</TEXT></DOC>
