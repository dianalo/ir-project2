And the chances of wrapping up a treaty before President Reagan leaves office early next year are growing slim.    So U.S. officials face a delicate decision. How hard should they push in negotiations that face long odds and a short timetable? Differences have emerged within the U.S. government on the answer to that tough question.    The wisest course probably is to keep pushing ahead in the hope that any progress will spill over into the next U.S. administration -- but to avoid a rush to an agreement that might include a verification plan the U.S. can't afford or limits on strategic defenses that restrict the U.S. more than the Soviets. The U.S. faces a danger that &quot;in the rush to go as far as we can, we will do some things we'll wish we hadn't later on,&quot; says former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.    But within the Reagan administration, some still want to push. President Reagan himself continues to yearn for an agreement, though aides say he has begun to realize he may have to settle for a simple continuation of progress. Secretary of State George Shultz and his principal arms-control adviser, Paul Nitze, want to push hard in an attempt to complete a treaty before Mr. Reagan leaves office.    Mr. Nitze argues that it is important to press for a pact now because the negotiating process inevitably bogs down when a new president takes office. In the meantime, new weapons will be introduced in superpower arsenals and an agreement will become harder to wrap up.    Mr. Shultz agrees, though some of his associates think he continues to push hard more because President Reagan wants him to than because he has realistic hopes of finishing an accord.    Elsewhere, the enthusiasm fades. National security adviser Colin Powell is a &quot;skeptic&quot; because he questions if enormous verification problems can be overcome, White House aides say. Maj. Gen. William Burns, new director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, worries about the chances of agreeing to a bad treaty by rushing to completion.    Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci sees merit in trying to wrap up a treaty, but military officers are deeply concerned the U.S. may push too far, too fast. The Joint Chiefs of Staff bluntly express their concerns about pushing too hard, according to administration aides who have heard the chiefs' views.    Mobile missiles are one negotiating obstacle. The U.S. has proposed to ban them because of the difficulty of verifying stockpiles of missiles that can be moved around. But some officials oppose a ban. They argue that these missiles tend to stabilize the superpower nuclear balance because an enemy would be less tempted to try a nuclear first strike if it fears mobile missiles could survive to retaliate.    Another formidable problem is verifying limits on cruise missiles, which can carry nuclear, chemical or conventional warheads and can be transported largely undetected. Neither superpower has figured out how the nuclear-tipped ones could be identified and counted. The U.S. doesn't even tell its own allies, much less the Soviets, which of its ships carry nuclear weapons.    Even if all those problems were surmounted, the superpowers still would face the issue of limiting space-based nuclear defenses -- an issue so nettlesome that it has long been viewed as the one most likely to derail talks on strategic arms.    All these issues loom when the administration still hasn't secured Senate ratification of the treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons, which is hung up over a relatively arcane debate on whether the pact bans intermediate-range missiles carrying lasers and other so-called futuristic devices.    &quot;I would guess that the president and probably the secretary of state and perhaps one or two people still would like to get something wrapped up before the end of the term,&quot; says Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former government official who is a scholar at the Brookings Institution. &quot;I think there are a good many others who just don't think there is time enough and who think we shouldn't push hard.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
