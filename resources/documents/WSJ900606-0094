The court's concern, shared by a number of other statesupreme courts, is that property tax-based financing ofschool systems tends to result in greater school funding inwealthier districts.</LP><TEXT>   Despite financing changes mandated by the court in 1975,the New Jersey court said the system still producesdisparities among school districts and thus violates thestate's constitutional guarantee of a &quot;thorough andefficient&quot; education. The court ordered that the state devisea plan to guarantee equal funding among districts by thebeginning of the 1991-1992 school year. However, the courtsaid implementation of the plan may be phased in over anunspecified period of years.   In recent years, courts have rejected school financingprocedures in Texas, Kentucky, Kansas, Wisconsin, California,Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas andMontana.   The New Jersey decision comes only a week after New JerseyGov. Jim Florio released a $1.2 billion proposal that wouldincrease state assistance to poorer school districts byraising the state income tax for wealthy residents andreducing the share of the state budget allocated to moreaffluent districts.   But lawyers and education finance experts say the NewJersey decision is especially far-reaching -- perhaps more sothan the governor's plan. Rather than requiring a minimumlevel of resources for poorer districts, the opinion callsfor the state to guarantee the same level of resources in alldistricts. As a result, New Jersey could be forced to raisebudget allocations for poorer schools each time wealthydistricts independently increase their expenditures.   Instead of allowing a restructuring of the current stateeducational budget, the court &quot;is essentially telling thegovernment you must increase expenditures for education,&quot;said Eric Neisser, a professor at Rutgers University lawschool in Newark. The opinion estimates that the remediescalled for in the opinion may cost the state about $440million annually. This comes as the state faces financiallydifficult times; its deficit, currently at $600 million thisyear, is projected to reach as much as $2 billion next yearif new taxes and budget cuts aren't approved.   Mr. Neisser said the opinion requires the state to do morefor inner-city schools than Gov. Florio had proposed, giventhat the governor's plan established only a minimumexpenditure requirement for each student in the state. But aspokeswoman for the governor disagreed, saying the Florioplan &quot;goes far beyond what the state has outlined.&quot;   Gov. Florio supported the position of the plaintiffs inthe case, 20 school-age children from four New Jersey cities.The administration of his predecessor, Thomas Kean, defendedthe current financing system. A spokeswoman for the NewJersey attorney general's office said that U.S. Supreme Courtreview of the case can't be sought because there are noissues of federal law in the case.   Meanwhile, in response to a similar ruling by the TexasSupreme Court last fall, the Texas state Senate yesterdayapproved a $528 million plan to increase funds available topoor districts. If the plan is approved by the House, asexpected, it would be financed by an increase in the statesales tax and tobacco levies. Texas Gov. Bill Clements agreedto the plan last week, after vetoing two previous schoolfinance reform packages that called for higher sales taxincreases.   The New Jersey decision reflects &quot;the inclination on thepart of a growing number of state courts&quot; to find a stateconstitutional basis for changing the way states pay forpublic education, said Laurence Tribe, a professor at HarvardLaw School. In a landmark 1976 decision, the U.S. SupremeCourt said that the equal protection clause of the federalconstitution does not provide grounds for requiring thatpublic school financing be restructured.   A 1975 decision by the New Jersey state court relied onthat state's constitution to require the legislature torestructure its education financing system, and in 1976 thecourt approved the legislature's plan to increase funding forpoor districts by raising the state income tax. However, theschool systems still rely significantly on local propertytaxes.   In its decision yesterday, the court said that the 1976plan did not work as intended, pointing out that disparitiesbetween resource levels at rich and poor districts havewidened since the mid-1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
