Cerezo, who has been under fire from the powerful right for evenconsidering talks with the rebels, said in a statement Friday that``only groups and organizations within the law'' can participate inthe dialogue.   He urged the Guatemalan Revolutionary Union to ``understand thehuman cost of a 30-year confrontation'' and to avoid a ``bloodbath.''   Mongsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, head of the nationalreconciliation commission, said the rebels told him at a meeting inCosta Rica this week that they won't lay down their arms prior tothe talks.   The dialogue is scheduled to begin next month.   The Revolutionary Union is a coalition of three leftistguerrilla groups.   Cerezo's one meeting with the rebels _ last year in Spain underthe terms of a Central American peace plan _ sparked a storm ofcriticism from the right. He has since survived an attemptedmilitary coup.   Cerezo pointed out in his communique that the regional peaceplan gives the rebels the option of asking for political amnesty inreturn for laying down their arms.   Revolutionary Union leaders have said they won't do this untilthere is a clear sign that the government is ready to address thesharp economic and political inequalities in Guatemala.   The rebel leaders are currently on a Central American tour thatincludes meetings with the presidents of Nicaragua and Costa Ricaand high-level meetings in Honduras and El Salvador.   The presidents of those nations, in addition to Guatemala,signed the regional peace accord last summer. It is aimed at endingwars in the region through negotiations and also calls fordemocratization and amnesties for political prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
