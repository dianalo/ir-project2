Gaubert, who is charged with lying to obtain a $32 million real estate loan from an Iowa thrift.    Mrs. Richards, the wise-cracking keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention last summer, made &quot;a hell of a witness&quot; when she took the stand on Mr. Gaubert's behalf in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, said one lawyer.    Mrs. Richards, who testified as a character witness, probably will be the only well-known political figure among witnesses in the trial, now entering its third week.    Jurors will not be hearing from Mr. Gaubert's most powerful political ally, U.S. Rep. Jim Wright, (D., Texas) who has been criticized for intervening with federal thrift regulators on behalf of the Texas Sandamp;Ls that Mr. Gaubert directed.    Mr. Gaubert was finance chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1986 and finance chairman of a 1987 fund-raising dinner for Mr. Wright that netted nearly $1 million for the House speaker. A spokesman for Mr. Wright said there had been &quot;no requests and no discussions&quot; of his testifying for Mr. Gaubert. &quot;We just don't have any role in this,&quot; the spokesman said.    Federal regulators took over Mr. Gaubert's Independent American Savings Association more than a year ago, citing bad loans. But the indictment against Mr. Gaubert revolves around Capitol Savings andamp; Loan of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, a tiny thrift that found its way into the morass of condominium construction transactions near Dallas in early 1983.    Mr. Gaubert's trial is the third brought by prosecutors connected to the federal task force investigating fraud in Texas banks and savings and loans.    According to the indictment and testimony so far, Mr. Gaubert arranged for Capitol Savings to provide $32 million in financing for the purchase of land in south Dallas. The land was purchased by Peak Investments, a Dallas real estate company. Peak, in turn, sold the land in small parcels for condominium development to 22 individuals who guaranteed the loans from Capitol Savings. Those individuals defaulted on the loans.    The land sales, which took place on a single day in March 1983, escalated the price of the land from 42 cents a square foot to $5.25 a square foot, according to prosecutors. The final price was supported by phony appraisals, they say.    Mr. Gaubert allegedly neglected to tell Capitol Savings that he owned or had an option to buy the land, according to prosecutors, and he is accused of receiving $5.6 million from the $8 million fronted by Capitol Savings.    The thrift, suffering from loan problems including the Dallas transaction, was sold with the assistance of federal regulators in 1985 and closed its doors in 1987.    Mr. Gaubert's attorneys, Abbe Lowell of Washington, D.C., and William Kutmus of Des Moines, have contended at trial that the real estate deal differed little from other transactions in Dallas at the time. They have also argued that Capitol Savings knew or should have known that Mr. Gaubert owned the land. The attorneys declined to comment on the case, citing a federal court rule in Des Moines barring lawyers from talking to the press during a trial.    A spokesman for Mrs. Richards said the state treasurer testified that she knew Mr. Gaubert personally and politically but was unfamiliar with the details of the charges against him. &quot;She knows him as an honest and forthright person,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
