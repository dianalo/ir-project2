Everyone can come out winners if we can achieve peace in theregion,'' Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha told a news conference.   A similar announcement accepting the 14-point Principles for aPeaceful Settlement in Southwestern Africa was made in Luanda,Angola. The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in MexicoCity, said Fidel Castro's government had accepted it.   The official Angolan news agency Angop carried a transcript inPortuguese of the government statement.   Roland Darroll of the South African Foreign Ministry said thenext round of talks will be held Aug. 2-4 in Geneva.   ``We offered South Africa as the next venue, and we are stilloffering for the following talks because we believe Africa is theappropriate place to hold talks on an African problem, but weaccepted the Swiss offer,'' he said.   In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crockersaid: ``This is an important step. We are not saying it is morethan that. There are a great many hard and difficult compromises tobe achieved.''   The United States mediates the talks, which began in May and ledto agreement in principle last week in New York. Other rounds wereheld in London and Cairo, with Angolan-South African talks inBrazzaville, Congo.   Major obstacles remain to implementation of the peace plan,which says nothing of timetables for Cuban and South African troopwithdrawal from Angola, cutoffs of Soviet, U.S. and South Africanmilitary aid to the warring parties, or settlement of the civil war.   ``Further agreements are envisaged in these principles,'' Bothasaid. ``We have traveled a long distance to get to this stage butwe are only at the foot of the mountain. The road ahead is steep,full of potholes and dangerous curves.''   The principles call for implementation of 1978 U.N. SecurityCouncil Resolution 435, which provides for U.N.-mediated electionsin South-West Africa after South African withdrawal from theterritory it has ruled for 73 years.   An important step in the negotiating process was agreement byAngola and Cuba that independence for South-West Africa, alsocalled Namibia, should be linked to the withdrawal of an estimated50,000 Cubans from neighboring Angola.   The principles call for a movement of an estimated 15,000 Cubansnorthward from the border area where they have recently deployedand battled with South African troops inside Angola.   A major obstacle to implementation of the peace plan is theabsence of agreement on timetables for the withdrawals.   South Africa and the United States want the Cuban withdrawalfrom Angola to dovetail with the South African withdrawal fromNamibia, anticipated at one year under the U.N. resolution. Cubaand Angola have said it would take four years for the Cubans toleave.   Also not addressed in the principles is the status of theindigenous warring parties and guerrilla organizations. SouthAfrican troops have fought inside Angola in support of theanti-Marxist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,or UNITA, also aided by U.S. weapons and supplies.   South Africa says Angola allows the African National Congress,which is waging a sabotage campaign against white rule in SouthAfrica, to maintain guerrilla training bases in Angola.   Also, the military wing of the South-West African People'sOrganization, or SWAPO, has its bases in southern Angola, wherethey have recently been protected by the Cuban forces fromcross-border retaliation for bombings and attacks on South Africanforces in Namibia.   America, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Cuba, and severalEastern Bloc nations give military aid to one side or the other inthe conflicts and that issue has also not been addressed.   ``Just as this is not the stage to approach Angola on the issueof their support to the ANC, this is also not the stage to addressthe question of our aid to UNITA,'' Botha said.   Negotiators have indicated that the dispute between the Luandagovernment and UNITA is regarded as an internal one for Angolans tosettle once the foreigners leave the country.   No specific reference was made to when South Africa would pullits estimated 3,000 troops out of Angola, and Botha refused tocomment on the question of a cease-fire or unilateral withdrawal.``We believe it (the agreement) will lead to a lessening oftensions,'' Botha said.   Hidipo Hamutenya, information secretary for SWAPO, wasoptimistic about the implications of the agreement.   ``When all the elements are in place, we expect South Africa andSWAPO to hold direct talks and reach a ceasefire agreement as afirst step towards the implementation of U.N. Security CouncilResolution 435,'' Hamutenya said in a cable interview from Luandawith AIM, the Mozambican national news agency.   Hamutenya said, ``It stands to reason that progress is beingmade and the prospects for a comprehensive settlement of theconflict in the southwestern corner of Africa are reasonablybright.''   The principles also call for: all states to recognize theintegrity and inviolability of borders; non-interference in theaffairs of other states; abstention from threats or use of forceagainst the territorial integrity or independence of other states;responsibility of states not to allow their territory to be usedfor acts of war or agression against another.</TEXT></DOC>
