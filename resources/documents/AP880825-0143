Dissident Aung Gyi left Insein Jail, quickly organized a rallyof about 200,000 people, and demanded an interim government beformed to lead the nation to democracy.   On Wednesday, President Maung Maung bowed to three days of massprotests against one-party rule and called for a referendum onmultiparty democracy. The leader _ the nation's third in five weeks_ lifted martial law imposed Aug. 3 in Rangoon, withdrew troopsfrom the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country.   But to the people in the streets Thursday, the moves clearlywere insufficient.   About 400,000 people marched through the streets of the capitaldemanding the government give the people democracy immediately,witnesses said. Diplomats earlier said up to 1 million peoplemarched in the city Wednesday.   Anti-government demonstrators controlled Victoria Point, thesouthernmost town in Burma, and student leaders claimed similartakeovers were occurring throughout the country.   About 300 workers, merchants and students marched throughVictoria Point, and one student said Maung Maung's promise ofdemocracy was ``a political trick.''   Aung Gyi addressed a hastily arranged rally at Padonma Ground,where public stage shows are held. It is near his home in theSanchaung area of the capital.   ``We have complete trust in President Maung Maung and Chairmanof the Council of People's Justices Tin Aung Hein,'' he said. Bothmen are civilians in the military-dominated government.   But Aung Gyi added: ``I demand Maung Maung and Tin Aung Heinform an interim government immediately to avoid anarchy andbloodshed in the country.''   ``We agree!'' the crowd shouted.   Aung Gyi, a former army brigadier, was a close associate offormer strongman Ne Win, but they split over differences ineconomic policy.   Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled the elected government. Hebegan one-party rule and imposed rigid socialist and isolationistpolicies that turned one of Southeast Asia's wealthiest nationsinto one of its poorest.   When Ne Win, 77, resigned last month as chairman of the 1.1million-member party he cited his age and took indirectresponsibility for violent riots in March and June.   He said the rioting ``showed the lack of trust and confidence inthe government'' and called for a referendum on multiparty rule.   Sein Lwin, a former army general widely hated for crushingdissent, succeeded Ne Win on July 27 and moved quickly against hisopposition. He resigned Aug. 12 after at leat 112 people werekilled when troops fired into crowds of anti-governmentdemonstrators.   Aung Gyi, 70, recently wrote a series of letters decryingeconomic and political decay under the ruling Burma SocialistProgram Party, and specifically mentioned Sein Lwin.   Aung Gyi, this reporter and eight others were arrested on July29-30.   Sein Lwin was succeeded Aug. 19 by Maung Maung, who had beenattorney general.   After his detention, Aung Gyi's name became a rallying cry ofsome of the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streetsto condemn Sein Lwin, and later, to demand that Maung Maung movetoward multiparty democracy.   Earlier Thursday, heading home from Insein Jail, people shoutedfor democracy without any official hindrance for the first time in26 years.   The atmosphere was festive. The sea of people and horn-honkingvehicles and the absence of police and soldiers snarled traffic inthe city center and made movement difficult.   Many people wore red headbands, and the national flag was flyingupside down, both symbols of defiance.   Government ministries were open but nearly empty, with no seniorofficials at their desks and the few junior employees on hand doinglittle work. Some local government offices were deserted after theyhad been ransacked by mobs.   Banners on buildings and vehicles, including some governmentcars, called for peaceful protest to bring about an immediate endto one-party rule.   No newspapers were available because workers at all sixstate-run dailies struck Wednesday to demand democracy and pressfreedom.   State-run Radio Rangoon said 1,683 protesters were releasedThursday from Insein Jail. It said all others arrested nationwidesince Aug. 3 in connection with the rioting would be freed exceptthose accused of serious crimes.   Those freed Thursday included 442 students, 78 governmentemployees and 27 Buddhist monks. The release brought to more than2,500 the number of people freed, but it was not known how manyremain in jail.   Maung Maung said Wednesday he would ask the party at anemergency congress soon to consider a referendum on multipartyrule, which could lead to general elections. Radio Rangoon said themeeting would be Sept. 12.   He said if the party refuses he and the 13 other members of theCentral Executive Committee would resign from the party.   In another development Thursday, Gen. Bo Mya, head of one ofBurma's most powerful rebel groups, the Karens, said a democraticgovernment in Rangoon would be only a first step towards ending the40-year-old civil war.   He said in Bangkok, Thailand, that his 17,000 guerrillas andother rebel groups were ordered to step up attacks against thegovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
