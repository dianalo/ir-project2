The decision, announced in the House of Commons by TransportSecretary Cecil Parkinson, cast doubt on whether such a link to thecapital would be built in Britain. One is being built in France.   Critics say failure to construct such a line would hurtBritain's trade prospects with the Continent and increase themisery of tens of millions of commuters who will have to sharealready crowded roads and trains with millions more foreignvisitors.   Parkinson said the link's builders, European Rail Link, havedeclined to proceed without public money. Rail Link is led bygovernment-owned British Rail, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherhopes to privatize the railway.   The opposition Labor Party attacked the government's decision.   ``Britain will enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19thcentury railway link,'' Labor lawmaker John Prescott said.   France already is building a high-speed link from Paris toCalais, which will hook up the tunnel's freight and passengertraffic to a high-speed system being planned across Europe.   The French railways SNCF last year offered to help finance aBritish high-speed rail link from London to Folkestone. BritishRail currently is negotiating with that company, the British Railspokesman said.   In addition, European Rail Link had sought about $600 million inpublic funds toward the project in return for commuter use of thenew line.   British Rail has not publicly announced how much a link wouldcost, but estimates put the price tag at $4.4 billion to $6.2billion.   One reason the French are more enthusiastic is that their tunnelentrance is in one of the most depressed areas of France. TheBritish end is in England's rural and prosperous southeast.   Many Britons cling to their insularity and are ambivalent toward``the Chunnel,'' which some think would allow an invasion ofEngland.   Mrs. Thatcher defended her Cabinet's decision, telling the Houseof Commons that British legislation prohibits the government fromsubsidizing international travel links.   Mrs. Thatcher said the government already was spending $3.4billion on roads and railways to and from the tunnel.   The veto is another blow for the beleaguered Anglo-Frenchconsortium which is building the 31-mile rail tunnel under theEnglish Channel entirely with private funds.   Eurotunnel has suffered from soaring costs, which are forcing itto seek extra funding from its banks and shareholders. The latestcost estimate is $13.1 billion.   The tunnel is still targeted to open in June 1993.   When finished, Eurotunnel will carry passengers from London toParis in about three hours, about the same time as an air flight _inlcuding time getting to and from the airport _ and half the timeof a car-ferry journey.</TEXT></DOC>
