 Theadaptor cards have been jointly developed with Tiara.andP;  The 10Base-Tconcentrator and twisted pair access unit are backwards-compatible withpre-10Base-T standard products.andP;  Ungermann has also introduced the SimpleNetwork Management Protocol agent for the Access/One Supervisor module as thefirst step in its implementation of SNMP as its management protocol forTCP/IP networks and part of its support for Open Systems Interconnection.andP;  Aprotocol software enhancement which provides concurrent access to DEC VAXclusters and Unix hosts over the Local Area Transport and TCP/IP through theAccess/One intelligent wiring hub is also launched.andM;10Mbps Twisted-Pair Access UnitandM;Ungermann's Twisted-Pair Access Unit for the Access/One intelligent wiringplatform is an external transceiver which provides 10Base-T signalling for anEthernet device.andP;  The concentrator, a managed active repeater, providessignalling for up to 12 10Base-T ports at 10Mbps over twisted-pair wiring.andO;As part of the Access/One system, the new 10Base-T products can be integratedinto multiple protocol, multiple-media and multiple-site networks.andP;  In anoptional mode the concentrator supports device distances exceeding 150 yardson unshielded twisted-pair wiring.andP;  For users with IBM Type 1 and 2 cabling,longer device distances are supported.andP;  Both the Access/One 10Base-TConcentrator and 10Base-T twisted-pair access unit ship now.andM;Simple Network Management ProtocolandM;Ungermann-Bass has a Simple Network Management Protocol agent for itsAccess/One intelligent struc-tured wiring platform.andP;  The Protocol agent runson the Access/One Supervisor card, which monitors and provides controlservices for all Access/One modules, and enables Simple Network ManagementProtocol-based management stations to monitor and control the Access/Oneenclosure.andP;  Ungermann is to offer further Simple Network-based products, andsays it has decided to develop the protocol because it provides visibilityinto, and control over, all other connectivity modules located within anAccess/One enclosure.andP;  Once a Simple Network Management Protocol agent isimplemented on the Supervisor it is possible to perform fault and performancemanagement on every Access/One module.andP;  In addition, Ungermann-Bass offerssome &quot;trap extensions&quot; (unsolicited event messages) that the Access/One agentsends to the Simple Network Management Protocol manager.andP;  The software willbe available first quarter 1991.andM;Access/One development with TandemandM;Ungermann-Bass and its parent Tandem Computers, have announced a jointdevelopment effort to improve the network connection between Tandem systemsand Ungermann-Bass' Access/One intelligent wiring system.andP;  The developmentwill focus on enhanced networking of end user devices, such as personalcomputers, Macintoshes and terminals in the Tandem environment, over theTCP/IP protocol.andP;  One prototype to come out of the co-operation is aTCP/IP-based Tandem 6530 terminal communications software package.andP;  This isexpected to be available in the first half of 1991.andP;  Other joint developmentproducts are to be based on the Access/One system.andM;Multimegabit Service goes on trialandM;Pacific Bell's Switched Multimegabit Data Service - a high-speedcommunication link which can be used for the interconnection of local areanetworks - is being tested at Pacific's internal test bed.andP;  The trialincludes the interconnection of several locations using a prototype interfaceinside of the Ungermann-Bass Access/One intelligent hub.andP;  The objective ofthe tests is to evaluate the technology and potential advanced applicationsof the Multimegabit Service.andP;  Pacific reckons that most organisations withgeographically separate facilities would benefit from the Service.andO;Initially, the Multimegabit Service will provide instantaneous 1.544Mbps or44.736-Mbps access to a high-speed switched fibre-optic network.andP;  Eventually,the service will offer higher transmission rates such as 150Mbps.andP;  ThePacific trial is scheduled to run until spring 1991 and focus on a number ofon-line applications such as medical and financial services that currentlyuse local area network technology.andM;Ethernet adaptors for twisted-pair linkandM;Ungermann-Bass has introduced three Ethernet adaptor cards for personalcomputers and IBM PS/2s, to connect local area networks via 10Base-Ttwisted-pair wiring.andP;  Each of the adaptors, called Access/PC-8, Access/PC-16and Access/MC, include on-board transceivers.andP;  Ungermann says the cardssimplify media connections by using a standard RJ-45 modular phone connectorfor twisted-pair telephone wiring.andP;  A DB-15 connector for a standard Ethernetcoaxial transceiver is also supplied.andP;  The cards interoperate with PS/2,personal computer and networking products, allowing migration to new productswithout obsoleting existing components.andP;  All the adaptors include support forUngermann-Bass' Net/One LAN Manager, NetWare 286 and 386 through Novell'sOpen Datalink Interface, Ungermann-Bass' Net/One TCP/IP and XNS, and arecompliant with NDIS specification.andP;  An optional remote-boot capability forNetWare is available.andP;  This increases data security by enabling disklessnetwork workstations to be used, as well as simplifying operating systemsoftware updates.andP;  The Access/PC-8 is available now.andP;  Access/MC andAccess/PC-16 ship January 1991.andM;Local network software for DEC systemsandM;Ungermann-Bass has introduced Net/One LAT/TCP Protocol Enhancement, toprovide terminal access from its Access/One intelligent wiring platform toDEC systems under LAT - DEC's proprietary Local Area Transport protocol.andO;Net/One LAT/TCP consists of software downloaded to the Access/OneAsynchronous Interface Module (ASM-100), leveraging the investment customershave made in their existing modules.andP;  Because Net/One LAT/TCP is part of theAccess/One wiring hub, network managers can implement centralised managementfunctions from the Network Management Console - configuration, performanceand fault management information can be monitored, reviewed and modified.andO;Net/One LAT/TCP also supports Simple Network Management Protocol and DEC'sTerminal Server Manager.andP;  It will be available in December.andP;  The ASM-100Asynchronous Interface ships now.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
