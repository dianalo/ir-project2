Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. introduced some long-awaited software that will make its current line of mainframes run a bit faster and will open the way for far more sophisticated applications.    The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant said yesterday's introduction, which was expected, was its biggest mainframe announcement since the 1981 unveiling of the operating-system software that is being replaced. The new software offers features that finally differentiate IBM's Sierra series of mainframes from the machines they replaced three years ago.    &quot;This is a big deal,&quot; said Joe Brophy, a senior vice president of Travelers, an insurance company that is a huge customer of IBM's.    At the same time, Mr. Brophy and other customers, as well as securities analysts, cautioned that the announcement will have little effect on IBM revenue for either mainframe hardware or software until well into 1989. They said that only IBM's biggest customers are bumping up against the limits of the current software, so few customers have an immediate need for the new software or the hardware required to use it.    Mr. Brophy, for instance, said the announcement &quot;probably will accelerate my hardware purchases a bit, but not by much.&quot; George DiNardo, an executive vice president of Mellon Bank Corp., said he thought he could take some time to evaluate the new software before switching to it.    IBM certainly could use a boost from mainframes this year. Mainframe revenue rose only modestly last year as the company posted its third consecutive year of disappointing earnings. Partly in anticipation of benefits from yesterday's announcement, IBM's stock price rose $4 last week, finishing at $112 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, up 75 cents on the day.    But if IBM is to benefit soon, analysts said, it will have to recapture customers who have been buying compatible mainframes in increasing quantities from Amdahl Corp. and National Advanced Systems, a subsidiary of National Semiconductor Corp. Amdahl and NAS have said they are prepared to match IBM's offering quickly, but it took them a year and a half to catch up after IBM's current operating system was announced in 1981. It will be more than a year before it is clear how well they will do this time.    &quot;In the near term,&quot; said Robert T. Fertig, a consultant with Enterprise Information Systems Inc., La Jolla, Calif., &quot;some customers who were thinking of going with NAS, Amdahl or the Japanese will sit on their hands and say, 'I need to sort through some of these issues before I place an order with you.'&quot;    The main benefit of IBM's new operating-system software, called MVS/ESA, is that it lets programmers deal with 8,000 times as much main memory as is currently possible. As part of that increase, IBM said, software applications will generally be able to run as much as 12% faster under the new operating system, with the biggest benefits coming on the larger mainframes. In fact, IBM cited one example of a company that tested the new operating system and found that an especially complex program produced its results in less than 20 seconds, compared with the 10 to 20 minutes it took with the current operating system.    Beyond that, the new software makes possible certain types of extremely complex applications. Mr. Brophy of Travelers said it would be theoretically possible for an actuary to work with a data base that listed 20,000 attributes for every person in the U.S.    As part of the announcement, IBM said it will offer software that will automate much of the decision-making related to where to store data, which can bog down programmers and computer-system managers. Bob Djurdjevic, a consultant at Annex Research Inc., Phoenix, Ariz., said he thinks this software includes unannounced features that will significantly increase the speed at which applications run on mainframes.    IBM also said it will offer a device that will let its mainframes operate as though they are four, distinct mainframes. Customers said that will give them some needed flexibility.    In addition, IBM introduced two mainframes that fill in holes in the Sierra product line -- the 280E, which has two processors, and the 500E, which contains five. IBM also extended the range of its 4381 line of mid-range computers by announcing two high-end machines that run the new operating system software.    The different pieces of software will be available starting between August and the end of the year -- earlier than analysts had expected. The hardware will become available between June and November.    Separately, IBM said it will increase prices for renting equipment and for maintenance and engineering services by between 7% and 15%. IBM usually raises such prices each winter.    At a meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., IBM discussed its 1988 plans for the personal computer market and said it will introduce as many new personal computers this year as it did in 1987. Bill Lowe, IBM's personal computer chief, said that by the end of the year IBM will have machines as powerful as its current middle-of-the-line models at the price of its PS/2 entry level model 25. Frank King, a top IBM personal computer development executive, also said that in 1988 IBM's top-of-the-line model 80 will be small enough to fit on a desktop. </TEXT></DOC>
