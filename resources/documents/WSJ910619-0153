The move to the suburbs is affecting lawmakers in thenation's state capitals, who are just now coming to gripswith the politically charged task of drawing new districtsfor state legislatures and Congress. Before long, it willchange the character of those legislatures and of the U.S.House of Representatives. And before the decade is out, thegreat migration to the suburbs may be reflected in massiveshifts in state and federal funding patterns.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's a lot of potential to move some political poweraround between cities and suburbs,&quot; says John Chamberlin, apolitical scientist at the University of Michigan who studiesthe effect of population on politics.   The new suburban shape of U.S. politics is coming clearlyinto focus in the tucked-away computer suites where data fromthe 1990 census is being used to draw the nation's newpolitical maps.   A generation ago, the residents of some of the desertreaches of California worried about having their own doctorand their own storekeeper. Now they're on the verge of havingtheir own member of Congress. &quot;Our forefathers would neverhave dreamed that we would have had a half-million people inthe desert,&quot; says Thomas Hofeller, who directs redistrictingefforts for the National Republican Congressional Committee.   The heavily suburban states of California and Floridatogether account for 11 of the 19 new seats that will becreated as a result of congressional reapportionment. Amajority of the new districts in California almost certainlywill be suburban, possibly in places like San Bernardino,Riverside, Orange County and northern California. Florida'snew seats are likely all to be suburban, possibly in placeslike the Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and Sarasotaareas.   Over the next few weeks, lawmakers in North Carolina,which gains a House seat in Washington, may create a newsuburban district sprawling between Charlotte, Winston-Salemand Greensboro. Arizona's new seat is likely to be in thePhoenix suburbs. Even when states lose seats, the newpolitical maps often will reflect the growth of suburbanareas.   &quot;Given where people are moving, it's absolutelyinescapable that Congress is going to get more suburban,&quot;says Mark Gersh, Washington director of the NationalCommittee for an Effective Congress, a Democratic-orientedpolitical-action committee that is involved in redistricting.   The migration to the suburbs, which began during World WarII, has become a fixed part of the political landscape. Whilecentral cities have retained about 30% of the population overthe past 40 years, the suburbs have exploded. About a quarterof the country was suburban in 1950; by 1990, according tothe Census Bureau, about half the population lived in thesuburbs.   &quot;There was only a scattering of suburbs before the war,&quot;says Donald Starsinic, chief of the population-distributionbranch of the Census Bureau. &quot;But after the war, all hellbroke loose in all that empty land near the cities. With theautomobile and relatively cheap land, people spilled out.&quot;   That trend continued at a time when the population movedfrom the urban Northeast and industrial Midwest to the Southand West. In the latest two rounds of redistricting,reflecting the censuses of 1980 and 1990, the Northeast andMidwest will have lost 32 seats, with the South gaining 15and the West gaining 17.   But of the two population shifts, suburbanization may havethe more enduring political effect. &quot;It's going on all overthe place,&quot; says William O'Hare, director of population andpolicy research at the University of Louisville. &quot;Acongressman from a suburb of Detroit is probably not going tobe that much different from one from suburban Atlanta. Buthe's going to be a whole lot different from a congressmanfrom the central city of Detroit or Atlanta.&quot;   The effect of the flow of congressional power to thesuburbs growing out of the 1990 census -- a trend that willbe magnified if the figures aren't adjusted this summer toreflect uncounted urban Americans -- won't be immediatelyperceptible. State lawmakers almost always attempt toaccommodate congressional incumbents, so many of the currentmembers of Congress are likely to be re-elected; the bigchange will come with their successors. In the meantime,urban-oriented politicians, such as Democratic Rep. DanRostenkowski of Chicago, chairman of the House Ways and MeansCommittee, and Democratic Rep. Henry Gonzalez of San Antonio,chairman of the House Banking Committee, will continue tohold important posts in Congress.   &quot;There's not going to be an abrupt shift,&quot; says RobertStein, a Rice University political scientist. &quot;But over time,there will be a big shift in power -- committee chairmen andleadership positions -- to the suburbs. There won't be suddenchange, but inexorable movement in that direction.&quot;   That worries many of those who are working to find fundingto help solve urban problems.   &quot;There are going to be fewer districts wholly containedwithin the central cities,&quot; says Jeffrey Passell, ademographer with the Urban Institute. &quot;There has to be asubstantial effect. The influence of the eastern andmidwestern cities has to diminish.&quot;   The shift in federal spending patterns toward the suburbsis already well under way. For years, Washington underwrotethe highways that made the very idea of suburbs possible andnow is underwriting flood insurance that makes much ofsuburban housing possible; the total value of land insuredfor flood damage in 1989 was $283 billion. CommunityDevelopment Block Grants began as a housing program for innercities, but now half the money goes outside of center citiesand there is a &quot;small cities&quot; program.   But as the political importance of the cities hasdiminished, the character of the suburbs themselves hasstarted to change, in many cases taking on some of theproblems and roles of the cities. &quot;Large influxes ofimmigrants for the first time are coming to this country andsettling in suburbs,&quot; says Joe Nicholson, director ofpublic-sector markets for Strategic Mapping Inc., whichdevelops software that analyzes census data.   The result is that the suburban electorate is much morecomplex than politicians at first believed. &quot;The oldersuburbs are more Democratic, but the new `townhouse suburbs'are more Republican,&quot; says Mark Bohannon, director ofelection analysis and planning at the Democratic NationalCommittee. &quot;And some suburbs are full of middle-class blackvoters who have left the cities. We're not talking about`suburbs' the way we used to.&quot;   The flow of congressional power to the suburbs will havelittle effect on minority representation in Congress, becauseamendments to the Voting Rights Act virtually assure thecreation of minority districts. But the combination ofpopulation trends and minority claims may make it moredifficult for white lawmakers of the near suburbs, such asDemocratic Rep. Martin Frost of the Dallas area, to retaintheir seats.   These population shifts may even change the politicalbalance of power in the final years of the 20th century.   &quot;The suburbs are now our dominant population group,&quot; saysMartha Farnsworth Riche, director of policy studies at thePopulation Reference Bureau, a nonpartisan research group inWashington. &quot;As populations move to the suburbs, and as jobsand shopping centers move with them, the suburbs themselvesare becoming more diverse. This is a new power base that's upfor grabs, and the politicians haven't realized it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
