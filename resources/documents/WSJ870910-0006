William Stinson, president and chief executive officer, told a group of securities analysts that &quot;the cloud over the titles of all our properties in Montreal and Toronto has been&quot; lifted. He said the holding concern plans a &quot;very aggressive approach&quot; to the real estate, which he called one of its &quot;underdeveloped assets.&quot; Among the most important land parcels affected is an 18-acre plot in downtown Toronto, where there are plans for development.    Mr. Stinson also said that he expects Canadian Pacific operating profit in the second half to be in the range of the first half, when the company earned 277.9 million Canadian dollars ($211.5 million), or 93 cents (71 cents) a share. Revenue was 5.99 billion dollars. A special gain of 193.3 million dollars made first-half net income 471.2 million dollars, or 1.57 dollars a share.    Mr. Stinson said Canadian Pacific's forest products businesses will continue to report strong profit while results from its oil and gas interests will depend on prices. At CP Rail, Mr. Stinson said he expects some &quot;bottom-line loss but nothing excessive&quot; from the weeklong rail strike that closed CP Rail and Canadian National Railways last month.    He said the railway lost about eight million dollars a day in revenue, but that much of the lost traffic should be recovered. The strike was ended by back-to-work legislation.    As previously reported, Canada's Supreme Court ruled in June that minority shareholders of Canadian Pacific's 80%-owned Ontario andamp; Quebec Railway Co. unit weren't entitled to compensation for the unit's properties that Canadian Pacific has sold over the past 100 years. The properties were acquired by Canadian Pacific when it entered into a perpetual lease in 1884 to run Ontario andamp; Quebec's railroad. </TEXT></DOC>
