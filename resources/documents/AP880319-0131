Also in Ramallah Israeli troops briefly detained four foreigntelevision crews.   Stone-throwing youths confronted Israeli troops in scatteredclashes in the occupied territories, but no shootings werereported. Hospital officials in the Gaza Strip said ninePalestinians were admitted with beating injuries.   A statement Saturday by the Defense Ministry said authoritieshad outlawed Shabiba, the youth group of Yasser Arafat's Fatah wingof the Palestine Liberation Organization with thousands of membersthroughout the territories.   ``Given its continuous involvement in the disruption of Israel'slaw and order in the area, and since it is an inseparable part ofthe PLO, it was declared illegal ... Members will be subject toarrest and trial,'' the statement said.   An army spokesman said troops moved into the Ramallah hospitalin the early morning ``to remove undesirable elements from thepremises and return control of the hospital to the doctors andnurses.''   The hospital, near the center of the West Bank city 10 milesnorth of Jerusalem, has become a gathering place for young Arabprotesters. They have raised the outlawed Palestinian flag on itsroof, hurled stones at soldiers, and taken refuge in the hospital'scorridors.   The army spokesman said troops removed ``those individuals whodisturbed the functioning of the hospital'' and retreated afterseveral hours, maintaining a guard at the entrance.   However, the Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said soldiersburst into the hospital, checking identification papers andassaulting staff members. The agency said troops stationed at theentrance also prevented relatives from visiting patients.   The agency said doctors and nurses at the hospital carried out asit-in strike against the army action later Saturday.   The foreign television crews detained in Ramallah included teamsfrom America's CBS and Cable News Network who the military saiddefied an order to leave the area.   Army commanders are empowered to close off areas under theircontrol at will.   Eli Fastman, a cameraman for the London-based Visnews, said thefour two-man crews entered Ramallah after they were presented witha closure order. They stayed there ``to challenge this crazy systemof closing us out of the territories,'' Fastman said.   Fastman said the crews, which also included a team from theLondon-based Worldwide Television News, were taken to a militarypolice station in Ramallah where they ``discussed the situationwith army officials.'' The army filed no charges and released thecrews an hour later, he said.   The Palestine Press Service said a free-lance reporter workingfor the New York daily newspaper Newsday, Nancie Katz, was alsobriefly detained by troops near the city of Nablus for violating aclosure order.   The army also arrested an Arab journalist in the West Bank townof Tulkarm. The journalist, Adnan Damiri, works for the PalestinePress Service, the agency and Israel radio said.   Damiri was arrested during the night in connection with securityoffenses, the agency said. He has already served 6{ years in prisonfor security offenses.   An army spokesman said he had no information on the arrest.Israel radio said it was one of several during the night in Tulkarm.   Also in Tulkarm, the army distributed leaflets calling on Arabresidents to refrain from protests, Israel radio said. The radioquoted the leaflets, also distributed in the town of Qalqilya, astelling inhabitants they would only hurt themselves by engaging indisturbances.   In the Gaza Strip, a curfew remained in force on the Shatirefugee camp and a section of Gaza City after sustained proteststhere.   Widespread disturbances began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza,where 1.5 million Palestinians live. Israeli captured theterritories in the 1967 Middle East war.   The United Nations reports that 102 Palestinians have died inthe latest unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
