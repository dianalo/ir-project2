The U.S. currency registered an intraday low of 1.7950 marks during Australian trading, but dealers said a lack of follow-through and worries about central bank intervention triggered the reversal that boosted the dollar back to the 1.8100-mark area. It hovered there for the rest of the day.    Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8088 marks, up from 1.8055 marks late Friday in New York. It also rose to 127.06 yen from 126.55 yen in New York late Friday. Sterling was trading at $1.7470, off from $1.7585 late Friday.    In Tokyo on Tuesday, the dollar opened at 127.55 yen, up from Monday's close of 127.20 yen.    Many traders reported Monday that the Bank of Japan had been checking exchange rates when the U.S. currency hit its 126-yen nadir in Tokyo. This, combined with comments from a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official, contributed to the dollar's gradual recovery.    The Japanese official, who chose not to be identified, said Japan is ready to intervene if necessary in order to stabilize the dollar in foreign exchange trading. The comment echoed several remarks made last week by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other senior Japanese officials who sought to slow the yen's advance.    Dealers said the U.S. currency also drew mild support from a move by the Bank of Japan early yesterday to allow short-term interest rates to fall.    The only central bank intervention of the day came when the Bank of Italy bought $10 million of the $38 million that changed hands at the Milan foreign exchange fixing.    But overall, trading was subdued as dealers said the market took a break following last week's sharp attack on the U.S. currency that sent it back into trading territory last seen in mid-June. Last week's dollar selloff accelerated Thursday when the August U.S. trade report showed a $12.18 billion deficit, widened significantly from July's revised $9.47 billion gap.    But market participants don't rule out further dollar losses this week, and they said they are going to watch the Tokyo market very closely to see what the larger Japanese investment houses decide to do. &quot;Japan is definitely the key,&quot; said Larry Ryan at Creditanstalt in New York. &quot;If more Japanese investors start to jump off the (dollar) bandwagon, we'll see the interbank community ride their coattails&quot; and sell dollars, too, he said.    Some traders said they think Japanese investors may choose to hold tight until the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, to avoid disrupting efforts on world economic policy coordination before then.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $412.20 an ounce, up $3.10. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $412.55 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
