But Mahe and other experts say Robertson's controversialpronouncements are likely to sink whatever hopes he holds ofwinning over enough mainstream support in the Republican Party tobe a serious contender for the presidential nomination at the GOPconvention in August.   ``Ultimately this could be his upending,'' said sociologistAnson Shupe of Indiana, co-author of a forthcoming book,``Televangelism: Power and Politics in God's Country.''   ``If Robertson doesn't make it to the nomination, it won't bebecause of a lack of money or grassroots organization or definableissues or momentum, it will be because he is so far out in leftfield with some of these statements that even his followers areembarrassed,'' Shupe said.   Even Ronald Reagan, who has often stood corrected, ridiculedRobertson's claim that his Christian Broadcasting Network hadinformation about the location of hostages in the Middle East.   ``Isn't it strange that no one in our administration was everapprised of that?'' asked the president at his news conferenceWednesday, in a departure from his loyalty to the Republican 11thCommandment: Speak no evil of any Republican.   Robertson said his hostage claim was only a ``throwaway line''to illustrate a point, but he complained wherever he went that heis being held to an unfair scrutiny.   ``I have been grossly misunderstood and the press has distortedwhat I've said,'' he said in Tulsa, Okla.   ``I don't go around with a press person on one side and a lawyeron another and a librarian behind me,'' Robertson said. ``I'm notused to having to give 200 answers every time there's one littleinnocent statement.''   Exactly right, Mahe said. ``What we have here is a talk-showhost who doesn't understand the power of talk; after all, whenyou're a talk-show host you toss these things out and who cares.''   ``My guess is that Pat is deliberately playing to his SouthCarolina constituency,'' said University of Virginia sociologistJeffrey Hadden, a student of the television fundamentalistpreachers. ``He doesn't care if folks in New York or Chicago or LosAngeles think he's crazy at this point. If he can get the pressbashing him a bit, it would help ignite his followers.''   Just as Robertson weathered the hostage crisis this week, hesurvived the missile crisis earlier this month.   When he claimed there were Soviet missiles in Cuba, the Pentagondenied it, the White House denied it, even Fidel Castro denied it,and Robertson merely shrugged off the outcry, saying he hoped thosedoing the denying were right.   He also suggested he saw the sinister hand of Vice PresidentGeorge Bush behind the timing of the disclosures of sexualmisbehavior by a fellow fundamentalist preacher, Jimmy Swaggart.   And he accused television anchorman Tom Brokaw of engaging in``religious bigotry'' when Brokaw referred to Robertson, a formertelevision evangelist, as a former television evangelist.   Bush challenged Robertson on Friday to ``prove it'' about hisclaim that Bush engineered the timing of the Swaggart disclosuresto hurt Robertson's chances in the March 5 South Carolina primary.And the vice president said Robertson is ``scaring the Americanpeople'' with loose talk about missiles.   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution student of the press andpolitics, said Robertson's ability to weather attacks on hiscredibility _ ``the Teflon factor'' _ exists because the press hasbeen easy on him.   ``The media gets tough on people when they become important,''he said.   Moreover, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at theUniversity of Virginia who has followed Robertson for decades:``The other Republican candidates are hesitant to attack him. EvenBush has done so gingerly. The Republicans know they need hisconstituency in the fall; they know these people are easilyoffended and will stay permanently offended.''</TEXT></DOC>
