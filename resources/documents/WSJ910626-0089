That's what the State Bar of Texas did this spring when itsought nominations for the best (read it worst) of bad legalwriting. Eight winners were announced last week at the StateBar's annual convention in Houston; predictably, no oneshowed up to accept the awards.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I canceled the order for the statuettes,&quot; says Dallaslawyer Bryan A. Garner, chairman of the State Bar's PlainLanguage Committee and an author and lecturer on clear legalwriting.   Actually, in an effort to protect the guilty, Mr. Garnerand his committee promised anonymity to the contest winners.Thus, winning authors were spared humiliation; andconvention-goers were spared acceptance speeches by thewinners, who produced such gems of legal writing as this:&quot;Parens patiae cannot be ad fundadam jurisdictionem. Thezoning question is res inter alios acta.&quot;   What the writer meant to say, according to Mr. Garner, is:&quot;The court doesn't have jurisdiction.&quot; So, why didn't thewriter say so? &quot;This was a judge who was trying to show off,&quot;Mr. Garner suggests. Now the judge can show off a prize: heor she was granted the Rise-of-the-Roman-Language Award.   The Unreviewable Award, for the worst passage in alaw-review article, went to this entry: &quot;Do the frequentinstances today of the lawyer and director bespeakbrazenness? Toward clarification and exactitude, a precisereview is in order.&quot;   Former Judge Thomas Gee, who retired from the federalappeals court in New Orleans, nominated this winner of theTypo Graphic Award: &quot;In the index to this brief, the Courtwill find an extensive copulation of authorities on thissubject.&quot;   Mr. Gee, now with the Houston law firm of Baker andamp; Botts,says such comic relief is rare, as most legal briefs aresimply long and windy. &quot;It makes the job a lot more boringthan it needs to be,&quot; he says. &quot;It's kind of like reading thework of fifth graders,&quot; he adds. &quot;You know what they meanafter a while.&quot;   But even Judge Gee may have had trouble with the winner ofthe Serpentine Sentence Award, a 174-word monster containedin a brief to the Texas Supreme Court: &quot;So the general rulemay be safely stated to be that where there is a general planor scheme adopted by an owner of a tract, for the developmentand . . . .&quot;   Darn. It won't all fit.</TEXT></DOC>
