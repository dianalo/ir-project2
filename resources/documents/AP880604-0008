(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A small Virginia aerospace firm says it hassigned a Pentagon contract to launch an unspecified cargo next yearwith a new rocket strapped under the wing of a bomber untilreleased and fired.   Orbital Sciences Corp. said Friday the first launch of itsPegasus rocket is scheduled for mid-1989. The customer is theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency.   David W. Thompson, president and chief executive officer, saidthe firm expects to launch satellites of up to 600 pounds for lessthan $10 million each, a fraction of the cost of vehicles launchedconventionally from the ground.   OSC's partner in the venture is Hercules Aerospace Co., anold-line rocket maker that had a part in the Polaris, Trident,Pershing, Peacekeeper (MX), Poseidon and Minuteman missiles.   Thompson said no government money was spent to develop the newrocket. He said the company expects to build, sell and launch apayload a month with the rocket.   The company will launch the Pegasus from a 36-year-old Air ForceB-52 bomber _ the same one that carried the X-15 on its firstflight in 1962. The rocket will be strapped under the ship's rightwing and released over the ocean at 40,000 feet.   ``It has twice the payload capability of a comparableground-launched vehicle,'' Thompson said.   The winged, three-stage, solid-fuel Pegasus is 50 feet long and50 inches in diameter _ about the size of the X-15, the firstaircraft to reach the fringes of space.</TEXT></DOC>
