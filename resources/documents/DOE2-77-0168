<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0168 </DOCNO><TEXT>Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) pulses of 1.7 J/cm{sup 2} and10 ns duration were used to deposit thin films of YBa{sub 2} Cu{sub 3}O/sub 7-//sub {delta}/ by laser ablation on NdGaO{sub 3} , LaGaO{sub3}, and SrTiO{sub 3} substrates held at 725 +- 5 {sup 0}C in 0.2 Torrof O{sub 2} ambient. Electrical resistivities versus temperature of allfilms show normal metallic behavior and sharp superconducting transitionswith T/sub c/ (R = 0) at 92--93 K. Critical current densities in 0.3--0.6{mu}m thick, 200 {mu}m long, and 10--30 {mu}m wide strips were measuredto be 10{sup 6} A/cm{sup 2} at 60, 77, and 80 K in the films on LaGaO{sub3}, NdGaO{sub 3}, and SrTiO{sub 3}, respectively. X-ray diffraction patternsshow that all films grew epitaxially, with domains of only two crystallineorientations rotated 90{sup 0} with respect to each other in the a-bplane (consistent with twins), and the c axis perpendicular to the substrates.The closely matched lattice constants of the film and substrates (0.8--2.1%)result in epitaxial growth of the films.</TEXT></DOC>
