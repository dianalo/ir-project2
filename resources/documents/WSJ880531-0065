Australia filed a formal complaint at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's trade regulatory body, demanding that the U.S. explain how the quotas can be justified under GATT trade agreements.    The action by Australia -- one of only two major countries in the world that run a trade deficit with the U.S. -- so far merely requires the U.S. to justify the quotas in &quot;consultations&quot; in Geneva. But it could be followed up by a more serious GATT legal action that would require hearings and possible sanctions; the U.S. itself recently used that path to get Japan to roll back agricultural trade barriers.    For years, the politically powerful sugar industry has persuaded Congress to pass laws that maintain domestic sugar prices at levels far above the world price. Currently, according to the Agriculture Department, the U.S. price is about 22 cents a pound, compared with 9.5 cents in the world market.    To maintain that price, the U.S. government since 1982 has imposed increasingly restrictive quotas on sugar imports. This year, the quota is about 750,000 tons, down from more than three million tons as recently as 1984.    In 1981, Australia alone sold the U.S. more than the current quota for all imports of sugar. This year, Australia's U.S. sales are likely to total just 50,000 tons.    The Australian complaint could prove particularly embarrassing for the Reagan administration just now, when it is in the thick of a fight with Europe and Japan to end quotas and subsidies on farm goods. The administration has formally proposed in current world trade talks that all countries end such programs, and is expected to battle the Europeans over the issue at next month's economic summit in Toronto. The administration also is on the verge of filing an unfair trade complaint against Japan for restricting beef imports from the U.S.    Although the administration opposes the sugar quotas as a matter of policy, it plans to defend their legality. &quot;We are prepared to consult with the Australians and we will defend our position vigorously,&quot; said Ellen Terpstra, an agricultural specialist in Mr. Yeutter's office. She said the GATT consultations on the Australian complaint are scheduled for next week. </TEXT></DOC>
