Faced with sluggish equipment sales and slowing growth in the snapshot business, manufacturers pin their hopes on 35-mm cameras that focus, flash, wind and rewind film automatically. &quot;They're taking the market,&quot; says Lydia Wolfman of the industry-tracking Wolfman Report. Shipments of the automatic lens-shutter cameras surged about 28% in 1986, even as total camera sales to dealers fell 7.9%.    Another hot new market: sophisticated gear for business and industry. Canon U.S.A. Inc. aims at government, the media and real estate with its electronic still camera, which doesn't use film and can transmit pictures over telephone lines. &quot;A New York Realtor can show a house to someone in California,&quot; explains a Canon spokesman. Olympus Corp. attaches a camera to an endoscope that probes internally for tumors. Fuji Photo Film Co. offers a way of capturing X-raylike images without film.    But snapshots continue as the mainstay of the industry, with a record 13.9 billion amateur photos taken last year.    PHOTOFINISHERS, facing a shakeout, add more services to survive.    High equipment costs force many independent labs to sell out to franchisers. Others are hurt by the loss of tax credits and favorable depreciation rules under the new tax law. One result: Minilab equipment makers market their equipment to video-rental stores. That in turn prompts photolabs to go into the video business.    Colorama Photo Inc., Wayne, N.J., now rents 8-mm video cameras. &quot;I had to do it or let the competition take over,&quot; says President Joshua Emanuel. Moto Photo Inc. opens a &quot;store of the future&quot; in Dayton, Ohio, offering one-hour processing and portraits, plus videotaped resumes, greeting cards and legal depositions. A growing number of photofinishers transfer prints or movies onto video. Some expect to be able to make prints off videotapes soon.    A RISING YEN slices into the huge U.S. &quot;gray market&quot; in photography.    Once the scourge of American retailers, the sale at deeply discounted prices of reimported export goods fades as it becomes profitable. &quot;It hasn't stopped entirely, but there's less of a gray market than a year or two ago,&quot; says Charles Smith, spokesman for Eastman Kodak Co., which recently discovered 1985 export film on sale here with phony dates indicating it was fresh.    Far from disappearing, the gray market has shifted to Japan, where manufacturers have been holding export prices down. Canon's T-90 cameras are being re-imported from New York and selling for 27% below list. Faced with re-imports of its popular Maxxum cameras, Minolta Camera Co. cut monthly production and raised some export prices 27%. The Photographic Products Retailers Association in Japan calls for film manufacturers to lower dealer prices to fight the gray market influx.    Despite a strong deutsche mark, West Germany isn't complaining about gray-market problems; German retailers are reluctant to stock such goods.    THE GREAT WALL: Photographic companies eye the Chinese, who love taking pictures but rely on low-tech domestic cameras. Kodak helps the Chinese launch a facility to produce film and paper, while a West German company installs the first minilabs. One barrier to big sales: limited consumer spending.    THE NO. 1 nonessential first-year expense for new parents is camera and film, says a survey by American Baby Inc. The cost: $220, or more than twice the amount new parents spend on first-year toys.    SNAPPY GIFTS: Almost 40% of all cameras sold each year are given as gifts, according to a study by Michigan State University professor Glenn Omura. Best sellers: disk cameras, instants, 110-film models that sell for under $50.    NEW 1987 PRODUCTS expand the range of picture taking.    Nikon's Action-Touch takes underwater photos in depths of up to 10 feet. Olympus's lightweight 35-mm Infinity Jr. weighs less than eight ounces and fits into a shirt pocket. Canon's Electronic Optical System uses tiny computers to expand its range for low-light picture taking. &quot;The emphasis is on expanding photo-taking opportunities,&quot; says Edward Fox of the Photo Marketing Association International.    More camera makers venture into video. Six major companies displayed 8-mm camcorders at a trade show this week, but still video cameras attract more attention. A Minolta accessory, as yet unpriced, converts the company's autofocus 35-mm single-lens reflex camera into a still video camera. Images are captured on film or on floppy disk and can be displayed on a TV. Casio Computer Co. announces a low-priced electronic camera, costing $650.    A survey finds dealers cool to instant cameras, such as last year's hot-selling Polaroid Spectra. They consider other entrants more exciting.    BRIEFS: College freshmen are more inclined to take a camera to school than athletic shoes, says a study by Teen-age Research Unlimited. . . .
