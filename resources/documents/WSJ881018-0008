Now, $33 billion in sales later, Wall Street is trying again -- this time with insured corporate trusts.    Four of the biggest securities firms Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., PaineWebber Inc. and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. -- have brought out the first insured unit investment trust of corporate bonds. Prudential-Bache is a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.    Individuals often shy away from corporates because of the risks, which are generally considered greater than with Treasury securities and most municipal bonds. But thanks to a triple-A rating and relatively high yield, currently 9.23%, the Corporate Income Fund, First Insured Series, attracted $30 million from investors in less than two weeks on the market. Other securities firms say they're weighing similar products.    Promotional material for the trust boasts of &quot;a higher degree of safety through diversification.&quot; But the trust actually consists of bonds from only seven utility companies. And six of the seven have more than 30% of their assets in nuclear plants, according to statistics compiled by L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., a New York securities firm.    &quot;You're essentially buying a handful of glow-in-the-dark bonds,&quot; says J. Michael Gaffney, chairman of Security Pacific Investment Management of Los Angeles, the institutional money management wing of Security Pacific Corp.    In fact, investors are basically betting on just one company -- the insurer, Financial Services Assurance of New York. It is FSA's backing that accounts for the trust's triple-A rating. Without the benefit of the insurance, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., a credit rating agency, rates the individual bonds triple-B or triple-B-plus. That's considered barely investment grade.    Roger Grimm, head of the corporates group of FSA, says the company is &quot;comfortable&quot; insuring the bonds. &quot;We think they're good solid companies that have finished construction programs and are relatively improving credits.&quot; And if one of the companies defaults on its bonds, he adds, FSA has first lien on assets.    Robert Topol, director of unit trusts for Shearson concedes the trust portfolio is not as diversified as he might like. But that's irrelevant in light of the soundness of FSA, he says. Both Sandamp;P and Moody's Investors Service Inc., grant FSA their highest ratings for its ability to pay interest and principal in a default.    The company's potential liability if all the securities it insures were to default is some $13.5 billion, while its capital as of last June 30 stood at $217 million. The ratio of capital to the worst-case liabilities is better than four out of the five companies that insure municipals, says Richard Ciccarone, senior research analyst of Van Kampen Merritt Inc., a Naperville, Ill., bond firm.    But although betting on FSA may be a good wager, the trust has other shortcomings for investors. Unlike Treasury bonds, corporates are callable, and that can sharply affect the return unit trust investors earn.    If interest rates fall soon, utilities may call bonds in the portfolio by paying a premium price to the trust. While that premium would have the effect of boosting the return in the short run, over the life of the trust there would be fewer bonds paying interest. If rates rise, the bonds won't be called but other investments will be offering higher yields.    Norman Schvey, chairman of unit trusts for Merrill Lynch, says the utilities might find it too expensive to call bonds out of the trust. Uninsured bonds of these same utilities are trading at &quot;well less than 100 cents on the dollar,&quot; boosting yields, he says. That indicates the market would demand a very high yield on new bonds, so interest rates would have to move substantially lower before the utilities would save money by refinancing, he says.    Investors who want to get out of the trust can sell their units back to one of the securities firms. But swings in interest rates would affect the price. The price, which is calculated by Standard andamp; Poor's based on the underlying value of the bonds at the time of sale, will rise if interest rates fall; unit prices will erode if interest rates go up.    Finally, there's the matter of yields. The securities firms involved in selling the trust are betting that most investors will like the extra one-third of a percentage point or so they can get buying it instead of a long-term Treasury bond. For someone who invests $25,000, that works out to an extra $82.50 a year.    But is that enough? &quot;If you're at the Aandamp;P, and there's a can of something for 98 cents, and you know its 91 cents at Safeway, you hop a cab and go buy six cans,&quot; says Mr. Topol. &quot;That's human nature.&quot;    ---                 Comparing Alternative Yields -   How the yield on the new insured corporate unit investment trust compares with yields on some alternative investments           Corporate Income Fund        9.23%           Treasury Bonds           (Shearson Lehman Hutton             Treasury-Bond Index        9.03%           Corporate Bonds           (Dow Jones 10 Industrials)   9.49%           Utility Bonds           (Dow Jones 10 Utilities)     9.96%</TEXT></DOC>
