The bombardment, just north of Israel's self-designated securityzone, coincided with renewed fighting between the two main Shiitemilitia factions in the southern villages of Sohmor and Yohmor.   Police said at least 20 people were killed or wounded in thehostilities between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, andthe Amal militia. The police report did not provide a casualtybreakdown.   There was no word on what touched off the Hezbollah-Amalfighting.   The two factions are locked in a 2{-year-old struggle forcontrol of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the country'slargest single sect.   By police count, at least 535 people have been killed and 1,490wounded in Amal-Hezbollah clashes since May 1987.   Today was the third consecutive day the towns of Nabatiyeh andneighboring Kfar Rumman, which have a combined population of140,000, have come under SLA artillery fire. Five people have beenkilled and 38 wounded in the violence.   The SLA said in a statement broadcast by its Voice of The Southradio station that the bombardment was in retaliation for assaultsby Shiite guerrillas Saturday and Sunday in which three SLAmilitiamen were killed and five wounded.   The Lebanese government instructed U.N. Ambassador RashidFakhoury to lodge a complaint with the Security Council about theSLA attacks.   A Foreign Ministry statement said the Lebanese governmentreserved the right to ask for a Security Council debate of ``thebrutal attacks by Israel and its surrogates in south Lebanon.''   The SLA and Israeli troops patrol Israel's self-proclaimedsecurity zone. Israel carved out the area in 1985 when it withdrewthe bulk of its occupation army from Lebanon.   The enclave, designed to serve as a buffer against cross-borderraids into northern Israel, covers 328 square miles.</TEXT></DOC>
