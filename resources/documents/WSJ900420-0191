But the government isn'tlikely to collect more than a quarter of it unless theInternal Revenue Service strengthens its enforcementprograms, Mr. Goldberg said.   According to an IRS report released at the hearing, theso-called tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed andtaxes actually paid -- was between $82.5 billion and $94.2billion in 1987, the most recent year complete tax data areavailable. Mr. Goldberg projected that it could reach $110.1billion to $127 billion in 1992.   And that's only counting the federal income tax on legalincome. Mr. Goldberg said the agency is working on estimatesof unpaid taxes from illegal transactions, such as drugdealing. Private calculations put the tax gap over $200billion if illegal income and unpaid state taxes and othertaxes are included.   It is impossible to wipe out the tax gap entirely, and Mr.Goldberg indicated that the IRS has little interest inaggressively pursuing babysitters and other &quot;folks scrappingto get by.&quot; But he did identify four business sectors wherenoncompliance is particularly acute, and he vowed to toughenIRS efforts to bring in the money owed.   Sole proprietors underpaid their federal income taxliabilities by about 23% in 1987, accounting for about $16.6billion, or 20%, of the tax gap for the year, according tothe GAO, which analyzed the IRS data. Those underpaymentsreflected both unreported income and excessive deductions,the IRS said. Mr. Goldberg said the IRS has begun an auditingprogram to examine taxpayers in this category with over$100,000 in gross receipts.   Large corporations -- defined by the IRS as those withmore than $10 million in assets -- underpaid about $15.8billion in 1987, 19% of the tax gap. Banks and petroleumcompanies were the biggest offenders, the GAO said. The IRSsaid improper accounting, whether deliberate or not, causedmuch of the underpayments.   Informal suppliers -- proprietors who often deal in cashand usually have no regular hours or place of business --underpaid about $7.7 billion, or about 9% of the tax gap in1987, the GAO figured. Frequent culprits were roadside foodvendors and people hired to make home repairs or providechild care.   And small corporations underpaid federal income taxes byabout $5.2 billion, accounting for about 6% of the tax gap in1987. Only half the businesses with $50,000 or less in assetsfully complied with the tax law, the government estimated.The compliance rate for businesses with assets between $5million and $10 million was far higher, 90%.   The IRS estimates the tax gap primarily using informationfrom audits. The agency cautioned that the precise amount ofunpaid taxes is extremely difficult to determine.   While Mr. Goldberg said the extent of uncollected revenues&quot;is certainly a cause for concern,&quot; he stressed that taxpayercompliance hasn't slipped. Rather, he said, the tax gap hasgrown along with overall revenues.   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the IRS has failed toreduce the tax gap partly because audit rates have plummetedover the past decade. In 1978, for example, the IRS audited7.42% of small corporations; in 1989, it audited only 1.61%.In 1978, 47.82% of large corporations were audited; by 1989the rate had fallen to 25.52%.   &quot;It will take many years to restore audit coverage toappropriate levels,&quot; Mr. Goldberg said. &quot;It's high time westart.&quot;   Criminal prosecutions of tax cheaters also have declinedas the IRS has focused more of its resources on bringinglegal action against drug dealers and organized crime,officials said.   Mr. Goldberg said that modernizing the agency's outdatedcomputer system and better educating taxpayers on the lawsalso will bring about increased compliance.   The subcommittee urged the agency to do better. &quot;I think acountry who is up to its neck in debt and deficits ought tothink about how we get the money from the deadbeats before weraise taxes on those who do pay,&quot; said Rep. Byron Dorgan (D.,N.D.).</TEXT></DOC>
