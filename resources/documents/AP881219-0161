Registering concern, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley urged all nationsto deny technology to Libya and also Iran and Iraq. She said Japanhad severed its connection with Libya's chemical weapons facility.   Meanwhile, L. Paul Bremer, director of the department'scounter-terrorism office, cited two reasons for concern about Libya.   ``This is a country which has a longstanding, close relationshipwith some of the world's most murderous terrorist groups, the IrishRepublican Army, (Palestinian radical) Abu Nidal and the JapaneseRed Army,'' he said.   ``Second, Libya has been willing in the past to provide verydestructive weapons to those groups without apparent concern howmuch damage they could do.''   Bremer, in an Associated Press interview, cited the supply ofSA-7 surface-to-air missiles and plastic explosives manufactured inCzechoslovakia to the IRA.   ``There is no evidence that the Libyans have exercised anyself-restraint on themselves,'' he said. ``The fact you've got theLibyans with a chemical weapons capability, the historic ties andthe propensity to turn heavy-duty stuff over to terrorists makes ita concern-raising situation.''   Bremer said there was no evidence yet that Libya had providedchemical agents to terrorists. ``It just isn't there,'' he said.But, he added, ``you have to be concerned they either would turn itover or use it themselves against another state.''   Published reports place the chemical facility in the recesses ofa mountain chain 35 miles from Libya's Mediterranean coast. U.S.concern is heightened by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's anti-Israelstance and the country's alleged record of terrorist activities.   American warplanes bombed Tripoli, the Libyan capital, in April1986 in retaliation. A daughter of Gadhafi died in the air raid.   Mrs. Oakley gave no indication the United States is contemplatingthe use of force or would support others if they tried to disablethe facility. She noted that an international conference would beheld in Paris on Jan. 7 to discuss the proliferation of chemicalweapons technology and that a disarmament conference would take upthe problem in Geneva in February.   ``We continue to call upon all nations to halt any contributionthey might be making to the Libyan chemical weapons capability, andto take vigorous actions to curb the illicit use of chemical weaponsand their further proliferation,'' the spokeswoman said.   The United States, seeking to isolate and weaken Gadhafi, hasbarred export of American technology to the North African country.It has also tried to persuade other nations to deny chemical weaponsequipment to Iraq and Iraq, which were accused by the Reaganadministration of using chemical weapons against each other's forcesin the Persian Gulf war.   The Washington Post, in a story Monday, quoted unidentified U.S.and Israeli analysts as fearing Gadhafi ``may be planning to provideradical Palestinian or Japanese terrorists with the wherewithal tolaunch the first chemical attack on Israel or Israeli interestssomewhere in the world.''   Mrs. Oakley's statement did not deal with specific U.S. concerns.   But she stressed that ``the United States is very concerned aboutthe spread of chemical weapons and the capability of spreadingchemical weapons in the Middle East.'' She also registered concernabout a proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region.   ``The U.S. believes that Libya has established a CW (chemicalweapons) production capability and it's on the verge of full-scaleproduction of these weapons,'' Mrs. Oakley said.   She said Japan had given assurances that its nationals were notworking at the Libyan facility and that Tokyo planned no furtherinvolvement with a metallurgical plant that may have been connectedto the chemical weapons program. She said Japan was fulfilling itspledge.   After CIA Director William H. Webster charged Libya two monthsago with developing the capability for chemical warfare, Gadhafisent a memorandum to the United Nations denying the allegation.</TEXT></DOC>
