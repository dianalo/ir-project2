The oil and gas and construction materials concern also adjusted the terms of its cash-and-debt securities proposal for a transaction to be negotiated with Stamford, Conn.-based Moore McCormack's officials.    Under the previous tender offer, Southdown said it would pay $40 a share for a maximum of 11,356,625 of Moore McCormack's 12.8 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Holders of Moore McCormack stock not purchased would have received Southdown debt securities valued at $40 a share in a merger after the tender offer. Under the amended offer, Southdown said, those holders would also receive $40 cash plus interest.    &quot;The values of the tender offer and merger consideration are equivalent,&quot; said Southdown president and chief executive officer Clarence C. Comer in a letter to Moore McCormack. &quot;This should allay any concern you and your advisors may have had regarding equal treatment of the Moore McCormack stockholders.&quot;    Although the indicated value of the amended offer is still $512 million, the new terms will force Southdown to sell additional debt or equity securities to repay part of the bank financing for the tender offer. Funds Southdown had intended to use to pay debt will now go to pay cash for the additional shares.    Southdown also changed the terms of a proposal it had made to Moore McCormack management for a negotiated transaction. Under that proposal, Southdown is now offering $40 a share cash for all shares instead of $35 a share in cash and $5 a share in debt securities.    A spokesman for Moore McCormack said, &quot;We have received the letter and will study the offer.&quot;    The news was announced after the market closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Moore McCormack closed at $39.125, down 37.5 cents, while Southdown closed at $41, up 50 cents.    In his letter, Mr. Comer also called for Moore McCormack, a construction materials and oil and gas company, to void its anti-takeover measures. The two companies are embroiled in litigation over those Moore McCormack provisions, although both companies agreed to suspend a trial in federal court here while they negotiate. </TEXT></DOC>
