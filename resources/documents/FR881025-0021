Moreover, the regulation has not keptpace with changes made in statutes underlying the subjects set forth_primarilythe Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act_and in NCUA practice.The NCUA Board proposes to restructure the regulation to make it more easilycomprehensible, and to update those portions which are no longer consistentwith Federal law or NCUA practice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>National Credit Union Administration, 1776 G Street N.W.,Washington, DC 20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Hattie M.

Proposed Part 790 contains informationconcerning NCUA organization and public requests for action by NCUA; currentPart 791 contains the rules of NCUA Board procedure; and Proposed Part792 contains provisions concerning requests for information under the Freedomof Information Act (proposed Subpart A), under the Privacy Act (proposedSubpart B), and by subpoena (proposed Subpart C), and concerning securitiesprocedures to protect classified national security information. CurrentPart 792 (``Employee Responsibility and Conduct'') is proposed to be redesignatedas Part 796. The NCUA Board requests comment on the proposed restructuringof Part 790 and welcomes any further suggestions to clarify and simplifythe regulation.The title of Part 790 is changed in the proposed amendment. The currenttitle of Part 790 is ``Description of Office, Disclosure of Official Records,Availability of Information.'' It is proposed that the new title be ``Descriptionof NCUA; Requests for Agency Action'' which matches the subjects covered.It is proposed that the title of Part 792 be ``Requests for InformationUnder the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, and by Subpoena;Security Procedures for Classified Information.'' The Board is proposingto use the titles of the Acts rather than citations to them to make itsimpler to determine what is contained in various parts of the Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 790_DESCRIPTION OF NCUA; REQUESTS FOR AGENCY ACTION</ITAG>Section 790.1 ScopeThis proposed section sets forth what is found in Part 790 of the regulations_thestructural organization of the NCUA, and description of its offices andrequests for Agency action.Section 790.2 Central and Regional Organization and ApplicationsThis section sets forth NCUA's organizational structure. The Freedom ofInformation Act (``FOIA'') requires that a description of the agency'scentral and field organization be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><T3> (See </T3>section (a)(1)(A) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(A).) Thissection was last amended in September, 1986. (<T3>See</T3> 51 FR 33588, September 22, 1986.)Subsection 790.2(a)_General Organization_has not been materially changed.Subsection 790.2(b)_Central Office_describes each of the offices withinthe Central Office. The parenthetical concerning the first two membersof the NCUA Board in subsection 790.2(b)(1) is deleted as unnecessary.Subsections 790.2(b) (1)-(9) are substantially unchanged. Subsections 790.2(b)(10), (11), and (12) are new. They describe the Controller, Personnel,and Administrative Offices. The addition of these three subsections completesthe description of NCUA's Central Office organization.Subsection 790.2(c)_Regional Offices. Subsection 790.2(c)(1) sets fortha chart containing the addresses of each of the six NCUA Regional Officesand the states and territories within the jurisdiction of each of the RegionalOffices. The Regional Office addresses have been updated in the proposedrule. Subsection 790.2(c)(2) describes the management of the Regional Offices.This description has been updated by the addition of a description of theassociate regional director, a position added to the Regional Offices in1987.Subsections 790.2(d) (1)-(8) describe the NCUA Central Liquidity Facility(``CLF''). Subsection 790.2(d)(1) is entitled ``General Organization.''Three technical changes are made to this subsection. A citation of Pub.L. 95-630 is deleted as unnecessary. The citation in the United StatesCode for the Government Corporation Control Act is corrected. The term``central credit unions'' is changed to ``corporate credit unions'' asthat is the more appropriate term. Subsections 790.2(d)(2), (3), andamp;(4) describe the Board of Directors, President, and Vice President forCredit of the CLF, respectively. These subsections are virtually unchanged.Subsection 790.2(d)(5) describes the CLF Vice President for Finance. Thesecond sentence of the description states, in part, that this vice presidentdirects CLF borrowings from the securities market. The CLF does not borrowfrom the securities market, hence, this reference has been deleted in theproposal. Subsection 790.2(d)(6) describing the CLF Treasurer is unchanged.Subsection 790.2(d)(7) describes the CLF Secretary (this position is filledby the Secretary of the NCUA Board). The last phrase of the second sentencestating the Secretary's duty of ``maintaining all records of the Facilityother than those of a financial nature'' has been deleted since the Secretarydoes not carry out this function. Subsection 790.2(d)(8) (``OperationalAssistance'') has been deleted as redundant. This subsection repeats theportion of andSection; 790.2(d)(1) that the Central and Regional Officesof the NCUA will provide services to the CLF on a cost reimbursable basis.Section 790.3 Requests for Agency ActionSection 701.5 of the NCUA Regulations, entitled ``Other Applications''describes how certain applications to the NCUA are made. In December of1987, the NCUA Board proposed removing this section from the regulations.(<T3>See </T3>52 FR 47014, Dec. 11, 1987.) The Board now believes that certaininformation in andSection; 701.5 should remain in the Regulations. Section(a)(1)(A) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(A)) requires that agencies publishin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>the ``methods whereby, the public may * * * makesubmittals or requests, or obtain decisions.'' The Board believes the informationcurrently found in andSection; 701.5 is more appropriate in Part 790 sincePart 790 describes the offices to which requests for action should be sent.The Board has proposed to remove andSection; 701.5 and to add a new andSection;790.3 containing some of the information currently found in andSection; 701.5.The Board proposes to name this new section ``Requests for Agency Action.''Proposed andSection; 790.3 also states that requests for which there is noform of application should be sent to the NCUA Office listed in this andSection;790.2 that could most appropriately respond. For most credit union requests,the most appropriate office will be the NCUA Regional Office where thecredit union is located. When the appropriate Office cannot be determined,the request should be sent to NCUA's Office of Public and CongressionalAffairs. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 792_PROCEDURES UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, THE PRIVACYACT, AND SUBPOENAS; SECURITY PROCEDURES FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_The Freedom of Information Act </ITAG>Section 792.1 ScopeThis proposed section sets forth what is found in Subpart A of Part 792of the regulations_production and disclosure under the Freedom of InformationAct. Section 792.2 Information Made Available to the Public and Requests forSuch Information This section of the proposal combines current andSection;andSection; 790.3and 790.8. Current andSection; 790.3 entitled ``Information Made Availableto the Public'' was last revised in February, 1975. (<T3>See </T3>40 FR 8538, February 28, 1975.) Current Section 790.8 is entitled``Requests for Information and Determinations'' and was last revised inDecember, 1981. (<T3>See </T3>46 FR 62835, December 29, 1981.) ``Determinations'' has beendeleted from the title since information on determinations is not foundin this section, but rather in proposed andSection; 792.6 entitled ``AgencyDetermination.'' Combining these two sections will eliminate some confusion.Most of the information contained in proposed andSection; 792.2 comes directlyfrom the FOIA. Several modifications are made in the proposal to make thissection consistent with current NCUA procedures. Subsection 792.2(a) sets forth types of information that agencies mustmake available to the public for inspection and copying under the FOIA.Included are agency opinions and orders, statements of policy and interpretationthat are not published in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>and agency manuals affecting members of thepublic. <T3>See </T3>section (a)(2) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)). Two technicalchanges are made to this subsection: A reference to the FOIA is substitutedfor the reference to the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') (the FOIAis part of the APA); and the reference to andSection; 790.6 of the NCUA Regulationsis corrected to read andSection; 792.2(f).Subsection 792.2(b) explains that, pursuant to the FOIA, the NCUA may deletedetails from the information made available under andSection; 792.2(a) ifan unwarranted invasion of personal privacy would be prevented. <T3>See </T3>section (a)(2) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(2)). This sectionis unchanged in the proposal. Subsection 792.2(c) sets forth the indices that the NCUA makes availableto the public to identify publications, instructions, policy statements,the credit union directory, and information available under andSection; 792.2(a).Such indices are required by the FOIA. <T3>See </T3>section (a)(2) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)). Several technicalchanges are made to this subsection. The sentence referencing the NCUACatalog is deleted since this catalog is no longer used. All NCUA publications,including manuals, booklets and the credit union directory, that are availableto the public are now included on the NCUA Publications List. Documentslisted on the Publications List are now only available from the NCUA; theyare not available from the Government Printing Office. The appropriatechanges have been made to the second sentence of this subsection. The fourthsentence of the current subsection states that: ``Statements of policyare maintained in a ``Directives Control Index.'' NCUA instructions, bulletins,certain internal manuals, and letters to credit unions are now includedon the ``Directives Control Index.'' The appropriate addition has beenmade to this sentence. The fifth sentence of the subsection (``A masterlist of Federal credit unions is maintained and available as provided inandSection; 701.17.'') has been deleted. All of the information containedin the master list is now available in NCUA's credit union directory. Inaddition, andSection; 701.17 was deleted from the NCUA Regulations severalyears ago.Subsection 792.2(d) sets forth when the materials referred to in subsection(a) may be relied upon. It repeats the requirements of the FOIA [<T3>see </T3>section (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(i), (ii)], and is unchanged in this proposal.Subsection 792.2(e) states that all other records that are not availableunder this section or published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>shall be available for public disclosure fortheir cost unless exempted by the FOIA or other law. Such disclosure isrequired by section (a)(3) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3)). The FOIA exemptionsare set forth in andSection; 792.3 and the costs for records are set forthin andSection; 792.5. Several technical changes are made to this subsection.The reference to the APA is changed to the FOIA and a reference to andSection;792.3 (the FOIA exemptions) is added. References to various sections ofthe regulation are corrected. Part of the second sentence of this subsectionstates that NCUA will make records available ``to any person who agreesto pay the direct costs of searching and duplication as specified in ** *'' The phrase ``of searching and duplication'' is deleted due to a changein the FOIA. According to the 1986 FOIA amendments and Office of Managementand Budget guidelines, some requesters (commercial requesters) are chargedfor review of records as well as for search and duplication. Other requestersare given a certain amount of search time and duplication free of charge.Additional requesters are not charged for search time and are given a certainamount of free duplication. The new fee schedule is fully explained inandSection; 792.5. Subsection 792.2(f) (``Information Centers'') contains the informationcurrently found in andSection; 790.8(a). NCUA's Central Office and each ofits Regional Offices serve as information centers. Subsection 792.2(g) (``Methods of Request'') contains much of the informationcurrently found in andSection; 790.8 (b) and (c). This section has been rewrittenand divided into three paragraphs (andSection; 792.3(g) (1)-(3)) due to variouschanges in NCUA request procedures. Special reference to credit union masterlists is no longer necessary since all of the information found in themaster list now appears in the NCUA credit union directory. Descriptionof the NCUA credit union directory is removed from this section and isnow found in proposed andSection; 792.2(c). The sentence referring to andSection;701.14 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (current andSection; 790.8(b)(3))has been deleted since andSection; 701.14 was deleted from the regulationsseveral years ago. Paragraph (g)(1) of andSection; 792.2 states that requests for indices shouldbe made to the NCUA's Office of Administration. The indices indicate howto obtain the documents listed therein. Paragraph (g)(2) of andSection; 792.2states that requests for all other records should be made to the appropriateRegional Office if one knows that the documents are located there. Allother requests should be made to the FOIA Officer of the Office of Administration.Paragraph 792.3(g)(3) states that improperly addressed requests may deferthe date from which time limitations described in andSection; 792.6 willbegin to run. Section 792.3 Unpublished, Confidential and Privileged Information This section was previously numbered 790.4. It lists and explains the exemptionsfrom disclosure pursuant to the FOIA. It describes which records are notdisclosed pursuant to such Act. The exemptions are found in Section (b)of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)). This section was last revised in July of1987 due to an amendment to Exemption 7 of the FOIA. <T3>See </T3>52 FR 27985 (July 27, 1987). No significant changes are madeto it in this proposed regulation. Section 792.4 Release of Exempt Records This section was previously numbered andSection; 790.5. It was last revisedin December, 1981. <T3>See </T3>46 FR 62835 (December 29, 1981.) It addresses release of recordsexempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Disclosure is authorized in accordancewith conditions set out under subsections 792.4(b) (1)-(3). Different conditionsapply for release to credit unions, financial institutions, and state andFederal agencies (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 792.4(b)(1)); to investigatory agencies (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 792.4(b)(2)); and to other third parties (andSection;792.4(b)(3)). This section remains virtually unchanged except for a deletionof a reference to andSection;andSection; 790.3 and 790.4 in the first sentenceof current andSection; 790.5(a). These sections do not provide for exceptionsto release of records. Section 792.5 Fees for Document Search, Review, and Duplication; Waiverand Reduction of Fees This section was previously numbered 790.7. It describes the charges forproducing documents requested under the FOIA and any waivers to such charges.It was completely revised in July, 1987, due to the 1986 fee and fee waiveramendments to the FOIA and the 1987 fee guidelines issued by the Officeof Management and Budget. <T3>See </T3>5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A); 52 FR 27985 (July 27, 1987). No significantchanges are made to it in the proposal. Section 792.6 Agency Determination As noted above, the current andSection; 790.8 (``Requests for Informationand Determinations'') has been combined with current andSection; 790.3 inandSection; 792.2 of this proposal. The numbering of current andSection; 790.9(``Agency Determination'') is changed to andSection; 792.6. This sectionwas last revised in December, 1981. <T3>See </T3>46 FR 62835 (December 29, 1981). The Section sets forth manyof the requirements and conditions of the FOIA concerning NCUA's respondingto FOIA requests and administrative and judicial appeals. <T3>See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 552(a) (4), (6)). In current andSection; 790.9(a)(1), the parenthetical reads ``except legalpublic holidays.'' In current andSection; 790.9(a)(2) the parenthetical reads``excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays.'' The languageused in andSection; 790.9(a)(2) comes directly from Section (a)(6)(A) ofthe FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)). The proposal makes the two parentheticalsconsistent with the language in the FOIA. The NCUA official who formerly made the decision on administrative appealsof FOIA denials was the Director of the Office of Administration. Sincethe Director is also the FOI Officer who makes many of the original FOIArequest determinations, the Director no longer makes the decision on administrativeappeal. The General Counsel now makes those decisions. In andSection; 792.6(a)(1)and 792.6 (c)(3), the references to the ``Office of Administration'' havebeen changed to the ``Office of General Counsel.'' In andSection; 792.6(c)(2),the reference to the Director of the Office of Administration'' is changedto the ``General Counsel.''Two additional technical changes are made to this section. First, in andSection;792.6(a)(2), the sentence explaining that requesters have 30 days to makean administrative appeal is moved up to become the second sentence of thesubsection. This reordering of sentences makes the subsection clearer.Lastly, in andSection; 792.6(c)(1), the two references to andSection; 790.6are deleted. These references are in error.Section 797.7_Confidential Commercial InformationOn June 23, 1987, the President issued Executive Order No. 12600, 52 FR23781 (June 25, 1987). Under the Executive Order, all agencies subjectto the FOIA must establish designation and notification procedures to beused for submitters of confidential commercial information and FOIA requestsmade for such information. The order requires that the procedures shallbe established by regulation, after notice and public comment. NCUA hasfollowed notification procedures for several years, but the procedureshave never been formally incorporated into the Regulations. Proposed andSection;792.7 implements Executive Order 12600 and, for the most part, currentNCUA policy. It does not impose any new requirements on credit unions.It sets forth procedures that NCUA must follow in its FOIA program. Thesection is based on a similar provision issued by the Department of Justice.The following analysis describes what is covered by each subsection ofproposed andSection; 792.7. All of the subsections are required by the ExecutiveOrder. Subsection 792.7(a) Scope_This subsection states that all confidentialcommercial information provided to NCUA by a submitter when requested underthe FOIA shall be disclosed in accordance with andSection; 792.7, that is,in accordance with Executive Order 12600. Subsection 792.7(b) Definitions_``Confidential commercial information''and ``submitter'' are defined. The definitions are taken from the ExecutiveOrder and are self-explanatory. Subsection 797.7(c) Designation of confidential commercial information_Thissubsection states that submitters of information shall designate what theybelieve to be confidential commercial information as defined by andSection;792.7(b)(1). Subsection 792.7(d) Notice to submitters_This subsection requires thatNCUA give submitters notice of FOIA requests for its information when eitherthe submitter has designated it as confidential commercial informationor NCUA believes the information should be treated as such. Subsection 792.7(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure_This section requiresthat NCUA give submitters a reasonable time, after the notice NCUA providesunder andSection; 792.7(d), to object to disclosure. Section 792.7(f) Notice of intent to disclose_This section requires thatNCUA give submitters notice that information they have objected to underandSection; 792.7(e) will be disclosed. This notice gives the submittersthe opportunity to file a reverse FOIA suit to prevent NCUA's disclosure.Section 792.7(g) Notice of FOIA lawsuit_This section requires NCUA to givesubmitters notice when a lawsuit compelling disclosure of confidentialcommercial information they have submitted is filed. Section 792.7(h) Exceptions to notice requirements_This section statesthat NCUA need not follow the notice requirements of andSection; 792.7(d)under certain conditions. These are self-explanatory. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_The Privacy Act </ITAG>As noted above, Subpart B of Part 792 implements the Privacy Act of 1974(5 U.S.C. 552a). NCUA's current Privacy Act regulation is found in Part790, Subpart B. This regulation was issued by NCUA in final form in September,1975 (<T3>see</T3> 40 FR 46276 (October 6, 1975)). The Privacy Act provides requirementsfor disclosure when an agency keeps systems of records containing personalinformation on individuals that can be accessed by a name or other identifyingparticular. There are also specific requirements set forth for agency publicationof its systems of records in the Federal Register. NCUA published an updatedNotice of Systems of Records in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 26, 1988 (<T3>see</T3> 53 FR 37360). This proposed rule does not make major substantivechanges to the regulation. The regulation is clarified and updated so thatit is consistent with the current Privacy Act. Section 792.20 Scope This proposed section contains the information currently found in andSection;790.20(a). Section 790.20 is entitled ``Purpose and scope.'' The titleof the proposed section is changed to make it consistent with other sectionsof this Part. In addition to several grammatical changes made to this section,the reference to the Public Law number of the Privacy Act has been deletedas unnecessary and the word ``personal'' has been added before the word``information'' in the second sentence. Current andSection; 790.20(b), whichaddresses Privacy Act training, has been moved out of the scope sectionto another section (<T3>see </T3>proposed andSection; 792.38), as it is inappropriate in thescope section. Section 792.21 Definitions The definitions section was previously found in andSection; 790.21. The definitionsare all taken from Section (a) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)). Thedefinition of ``statistical record'' found in section (a)(6) of the PrivacyAct is not currently in our Regulations. The term is used in andSection;790.28(e) of the current regulations (andSection; 792.28(e) of this proposedrule). We have added the definition of ``statistical record'' as subsection792.21(f) of our proposal. The definitions of ``Administration'' and ``Board''currently found in andSection; 790.21 (a) and (b) are deleted from this Sectionas unnecessary as they are defined elsewhere in the Regulations. Section 792.22 Procedures for requests pertaining to individual recordsin a system of records Section (d)(1) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)) requires, in part,that individuals be permitted to gain access to records or informationtherein pertaining to them within a system of records. Section 792.22 (currently790.22) implements this provision of the Privacy Act. This section is virtuallyunchanged in the proposal.Section 792.23 Times, Places, and Requirements for Identification of IndividualsMaking Requests and Identification of Records Requested Section (f) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)) requires that agenciespromulgate rules defining times, places, and requirements for identifyingindividuals requesting information from a system and procedures for disclosureof such information. Subsections 792.23(a), (c) and (e) (currently andSection;790.23 (a), (c) and (e)) implement this provision. These subsections aresubstantively unchanged in the proposal. Section (d)(1) of the PrivacyAct (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)) permits an individual to have a person accompanyhim to review records requested if the requesting individual furnishesa written statement authorizing the accompanying person. Section 792.23(d)implements such provision and has not been changed in the proposal. Section(h) of the Privacy Act addresses rights of legal guardians. Section 792.23(b)implements this section and is substantively unchanged in the proposal.Section 792.24 Notice of Existence of Records, Access Decisions and Disclosureof Requested Information; Time Limits This section is currently found at 790.24. As noted above, Section (f)of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)) requires the agencies promulgaterules establishing procedures for disclosure of records. Subsections 792.24(a)and (b) implement this provision of the Privacy Act. The second sentenceof current andSection; 790.24(a) is deleted as unnecessary. The last sentence,which deals with appeals, has been moved to proposed andSection; 792.27(f)as it seems to fit more appropriately there. Section 792.24(c) states thatindividuals will not be allowed access to information compiled in anticipationof a civil action or proceeding pursuant to andSection; (d)(5) of the PrivacyAct or exempt from disclosure pursuant to Sections (j) or (k) of the PrivacyAct (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5)(j), (k)). This subsection is substantively unchangedin the proposal. Section 792.25 Special Procedures: Information Furnished by Other Agencies;Medical Records This Section is currently found at andSection; 90.25. Section 792.25(a) setsforth procedures for occasions when an individual requests records thatwere furnished to the NCUA by other Federal agencies. This issue is notspecifically addressed in the Privacy Act; however, the provision implementsthe general disclosure procedure section addressed in section (f)(3) ofthe Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(3)). The same section of the PrivacyAct states that special procedures can be required for the disclosure ofmedical records. This provision is implemented by Section 792.25(b). ThisSection is substantively unchanged in the proposal. Section 792.26 Requests for Correction or Amendment to Record, AdministrativeReview of Requests Section (d)(2) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2)) requires that agenciespermit individuals to request amendment of records pertaining to them withincertain time limitations. Section (f)(4) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(4))requires agencies to promulgate rules establishing procedures for agenciesto review requests to amend records. Section 792.26 (current andSection;790.26) implements these provisions. The second sentence of andSection; 792.26(a)is deleted in the proposal as unnecessary. No other significant changesare made in this Section of the proposal. Section 792.27 Appeal of Initial Adverse Determination Section (f)(4) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552(f)(4)) requires that anagency promulgate rules for appeal of an adverse agency determination ona request by an individual to amend that individual's record. Section (d)(3)of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552(d)(3)) requires that the agency permitan individual to file a concise statement setting forth the reasons fordisagreement with the agency's adverse determination. Proposed andSection;792.27 (current andSection; 790.27) implements these provisions of the PrivacyAct. References to the Director of the Office of Administration and theChairman have been changed to the General Counsel in this section as appealsof determinations will be made to the General Counsel, as is done in thecase of appeals of FOIA determinations. Subsection (e) has been made apart of subsection (b). A new andSection; 792.27(e) is added. This sectionaddresses appeal of denial of access due to an exemption from the PrivacyAct. This language currently appears in andSection; 790.24(a) of the regulation.It fits more appropriately into this appeal section. Although there isno statutory right to an appeal within the Agency for denial of accessdue to an exemption, the appeal right has always been a part of NCUA'sPrivacy Act regulation. Section 792.28 Disclosure of Records to Person Other Than the Individualto Whom It Pertains This section sets forth when disclosures can be made without the priorconsent of the individual to whom the information pertains. This sectionlists the information given in Section (b) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.552a(b)). Proposed andSection; 792.28 (current andSection; 790.28) has beenupdated to make it consistent with the current Privacy Act by making changesto andSection; 792.28(f) concerning disclosure of records to the NationalArchives and by the addition of andSection; 792.28(1) concerning disclosureof records to consumer reporting agencies. Section 792.29 Accounting for Disclosure Section (c) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(c)) requires that agencieskeep accountings of certain disclosures made. Proposed andSection; 792.29(current andSection; 790.29) implements this requirement. The only changemade is in proposed andSection; 792.29(b) where ``National Archives and RecordsService'' has been amended to read ``National Archives and Records Administration.''The Archives, which was previously part of the General Services Administration,is now a separate Agency.Section 792.30 Requests for Accounting for DisclosuresSection (c) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(c)) requires that agenciesmake accountings available to individuals named in the records disclosedat their request. Section 792.30 (current andSection; 790.30) implementsthis provision. No changes are made to this section of the proposed regulation.Proposed Deletion_Emergency DisclosuresCurrent Section 790.31 sets forth procedures for notification of individualswhen records are disclosed under compelling circumstances affecting healthor safety. Such disclosure is permitted pursuant to section (b)(8) of thePrivacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(8)) and is already addressed in proposedandSection; 792.28(h) of this regulation. Section 792.28((h) requires, pursuantto the Privacy Act, that notification be transmitted to the last knownaddress of the individual. The specific notification procedures set forthin andSection; 790.31 are not required by the Privacy Act. Hence, this sectionis proposed to be deleted as repetitive. Section 792.31 Collection of Information From Individuals; InformationForms This section appears in the current regulation as andSection; 790.32. Section(e) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)) sets forth various requirementsfor agencies that maintain systems of records, including requirements thatinformation collected be relevant to an agency function; that only certainrecords that describe an individual's exercise of rights guaranteed bythe First Amendment can be maintained; and that certain disclosures bemade to individuals supplying information. It requires further that agenciesprovide individuals supplying information with certain information on aseparate form. These requirements are implemented by andSection; 792.31(a),792.31(b) (1)-(4), and 792.31(c). The last two sentences of andSection; 790.32(c)are deleted in this proposal as no longer necessary. They deal with thetiming of form revision and refer to distribution prior to September, 1975.A note to the Privacy Act (section 7 of Pub. L. 93-579) addresses an individual'sdisclosure of his social security number. Section 792.31(b)(5) implementsthis provision. Section 792.32 Contracting for Operation of a System of Records Section (m) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(m)) allows an agency to contractout the operation of a system of records. It states that when the operationof a system is contracted out, the provisions of the Privacy Act continueto apply. Proposed andSection; 792.32 (current andSection; 790.33) implementsthis provision. The language in the proposed section is simplified. Section 792.33 Fees Section (f)(5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5)) allows an agencyto establish fees to be charged to individuals for making copies of records,excluding cost of any search and review. Proposed andSection; 792.33 (currentandSection; 790.34) implements this provision. The fee for copying one pageis raised in the proposed section from $.10 to $.25 to reflect actual costs.The last phrase of andSection; 790.34(a)(2) is deleted in the proposal. Itstates that individuals will be notified of all costs of copies in nondocumentform (generally records from a computer source) before they are incurred.Section 790.34(b) requires that individuals be notified prior to fee chargesof more than $25. Such notification seems sufficient for both documentand nondocument copies. Section 792.34_Exemptions Sections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(j), (k)) authorizeagencies to exempt certain systems of records from various provisions ofthe Privacy Act. Proposed andSection; 792.34 (current andSection; 790.35) implementsthis provision. Several changes are made in this proposed section to makeit current with NCUA's recently-published Notice of Systems of Records.No substantive changes have been made in proposed andSection; 792.34(a).Several grammatical changes are made to make this subsection easier toread. Subsection 792.34(b) lists the systems of records that are exempt.These systems are listed in andSection; 790.35(b) and (c) of the currentregulation. The current regulation lists the first exempt system as SystemNCUA-2. This system (``Employee Security Investigations Containing AdverseInformation'') is now System NCUA-1 and appears in proposed Section 792.34(b)(1).The second exempt system in the current regulation is System NCUA-17 (``SecurityClearance Records Concerning NCUA Personnel Who Occupy Critical SensitivePositions''). This system has not been maintained by the NCUA for the pastseveral years. The information concerning it has been deleted in the proposedregulation. The third exempt system in the current regulation (andSection;790.35(c)) is System NCUA-4 (``Investigative Reports Involving PossibleFelonies and/or Violations of the Federal Credit Union Act''). This systemis now System NCUA-15 and appears in andSection; 792.34(b)(2). This systemnow includes information on violations of criminal statutes as well asthe Federal Credit Union Act. The appropriate changes have been made inthe proposed section. Proposed Section 792.34(c) (current andSection; 790.35(d))defines ``confidential source.'' This definition is found in section (k)(2)of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). It is unchanged in the proposal.Section 792.35 Security of Systems of Records Section (e)(10) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(10)) requires thatagencies establish safeguards to insure the security and confidentialityof systems of records. Proposed andSection; 792.35 (current andSection; 790.36)implements this section of the Privacy Act. The only change made in theproposal is that the last sentence of andSection; 790.36(a), requiring thatautomated systems comply with security standards promulgated by the NationalBureau of Standards, has been deleted as unnecessary. Such standards arenot required by the Privacy Act.Section 792.36 Use and Collection of Social Security Numbers As noted above under proposed andSection; 792.31, the provisions concerningdisclosure of social security numbers are found in a note to the PrivacyAct (<T3>see </T3>section 7 of Pub. L. 93-579). This proposed section (and currentandSection; 790.37) ensure that NCUA employees are aware of the provisionsin the note to the Privacy Act affecting disclosure of social securitynumbers. The only change made in this section of the proposal is a deletionof the examples of NCUA Office Directors. Section 792.37 Training and Employee Standards of Conduct With Regard toPrivacy Section (e) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)) sets forth agency requirementsfor systems of records, including training of agency employees, maintenance,and disclosure of records. Section (c) requires that agencies keep accountingsof disclosures. Sections (g) and (i) of the Privacy Act set forth the civiland criminal remedies for Privacy Act violations, respectively. Section(q) of the Privacy Act addresses the interplay between the Privacy Actand the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''). This proposed section implementsvarious provisions of sections (e), (c) and (q), and informs agency employeesof sections (g) and (i). The word ``training'' has been added to the titleof this proposed Section. As noted above under proposed andSection; 792.20,the information in current andSection; 790.20(a) is moved to this sectionand is renumbered as andSection; 792.37(a). It states that the Director ofthe Administrative Office will be responsible for training employees inthe obligations imposed by the Privacy Act. No substantive changes aremade to this subsection. Proposed andSection; 792.37(b) (current andSection;790.38(a)) implements portions of section (e) and informs employees ofsections (g) and (i) of the Privacy Act. Proposed andSection; 792.37(c) (1)-(10)(current andSection; 790.38(c) (1)-(10)) implement various provisions ofsections (e), (c) and (q) of the Privacy Act. The only substantive changeto these subsections is to andSection; 792.37(c)(8). The FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552)has been added to this subsection as an Act under which disclosures canbe made. This is due to a 1982 amendment to the Privacy Act that addedthe following provision as section (q)(2) to the Privacy Act: ``No agencyshall rely on any exemption in this section to withhold from an individualany record which is otherwise accessible to such individual under the provisionsof section 552 of this title.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_Subpoenas </ITAG>This Subpart is currently andSection; 790.6. It is moved in this proposalto the end of the FOIA and Privacy regulatory provisions so that it willbe easier to locate. This section was last revised in December, 1981. (<T3>See </T3>46 FR 62835 (December 29, 1981). It sets forth policy on whenNCUA is subject to requests for exempt material by legal process, particularlywhen and under what circumstances exempt information that is the subjectof a subpoena will be released. Current andSection; 790.6(a), (b) and (c)now appear as andSection; 792.40, 792.41 and 792.42. Service of subpoenaor other legal process requesting agency records shall be made upon theOffice of General Counsel. The Office of General Counsel will provide adviceto all agency personnel or third parties when agency records are soughtfrom them. If the Office of General Counsel advises not to produce therequested information, the party required to respond should decline toproduce based on the advice of the Office of General Counsel. The sectionis necessary to protect NCUA's interest in the exempt material. It is substantivelyunchanged in the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart D_Security Procedures for Classified Information </ITAG>This section, andSection; 790.11 in the current regulations, becomes SubpartD of Part 792 in the proposal. Section 790.11 was issued in November, 1979, after the promulgation ofExecutive Order 12065. <T3>See</T3> 44 FR 65732 (November 15, 1979). The Executive Order set forthcertain requirements and procedures to be followed when agencies classifyand otherwise handle national security information. The section deals withinternal agency procedures. A new Executive Order (Executive Order 12346,47 FR 15557, April 2, 1982) was issued in 1982 replacing Executive Order12065. Section 5.3 of Executive Order 12346 requires that:<ITAG tagnum="20">[a]gencies that originate or handle classified information shall:* * * (b) promulgate implementing regulations. * * *</ITAG>NCUA has in the past handled classified information, but has not done sorecently. The Board invites comment on whether this regulation is any longerneeded. The proposed rule is similar to the current andSection; 790.11. The numberingof proposed Subpart D is andSection; 792.50 and 792.51. All references toExecutive Order 12065 have been changed to Executive Order 12346. CurrentandSection; 790.11(b)(2) states that the Director of the Office of Administrationwill handle all national security information. If the Director or Director'sdesignee is unavailable, the documents will be handled by the FOIA Officer.If the FOIA Officer is unavailable, the documents will be handled by theDirector of Personnel. Since the Director of the Administrative Officeis the FOIA Officer, reference to the FOIA Officer is deleted in the proposal.If the Director of the Administrative Office or the designee is unavailable,the documents will be turned over to the Director of Personnel.Section 790.11(b)(3), dealing with document reproduction, has been deletedin the proposal since this subject is not addressed in the new ExecutiveOrder. The reference to the Information Security Oversight Office DirectiveNo. 1, Section IV F 5a in current andSection; 790.11(b)(4) has been deletedsince the directive is subject to change. Current andSection; Section 790.11(b)(5)addresses employee education. The last sentence refers to future employeesand is eliminated because it is redundant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Since these proposed amendments impose requirements on the NCUA ratherthan on credit unions, submitters or requesters of information, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act and Executive Order 12612(``Federalism'') are inapplicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>12 CFR Part 790Credit Unions, description, organization12 CFR Part 792Credit unions, Applications, Freedom of information, Fees, waivers, Subpoenas,Privacy, National security procedures.By the National Credit Union Administration Board on October 13, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to revise its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 701.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Removed] </ITAG>1.
