Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Tuesday inresponse to Pentagon outrage over congressional refusal to considera shift in defense funds.   The Defense Department requested the authority to move $852million from other accounts to personnel to avoid the dismissal oftens of thousands of men and women by October. The cuts arerequired under the Gramm-Rudman budget cutting law.   But Aspin, with the backing of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,D-Wash., declined to bring the request up before his committee,informing the service chiefs and his committee colleagues inseparate letters dated Monday.   Such reprogrammings of funds must be approved by each of theHouse and Senate Armed Services Committees and the House and SenateAppropriations Committees.   ``If we don't stand firm now, this administration will have usplaying `chicken' with the budget every year, distorting thedeficit reduction process and relying on us to save it from itsmore irresponsible excesses,'' Aspin said in a memorandum to hiscommittee members.   Bush had the option of exempting military personnel from theGramm-Rudman law.   Aspin said his committee is rejecting the budget ``shell game''that Bush and White House budget chief Richard Darman are playingwith the military personnel account.   But Pentagon officials lashed out at the congressional inaction,charging that it will have ``an absolutely devastating effect'' onmilitary personnel.   The Pentagon estimates that without the reprogramming authority,44,100 to 68,200 military personnel would have to be fired by Oct.1; between 32,500 and 32,600 people would be frozen in theircurrent jobs; 57,000 to 67,000 promotions would be delayed; and59,900 to 115,900 fewer men and women could be brought into thearmed forces.   There are about 2.1 million men and women in uniform.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams argued that Defense SecretaryDick Cheney was directed by Congress in the fiscal 1990 defensespending bill to request approval of the transfer.   Williams quoted the bill as saying the request should be made``to prevent a return to the 1970's phenomenon of the `hollow' Armyin which many units were substantially undermanned.''   Williams said the Pentagon has been preparing ``dramaticdecreases'' in force size to be executed judiciously over a periodof years.   ``You don't simply reach in and yank out a certain number ofpeople in the force,'' he said.   Christopher Jehn, assistant secretary of defense for forcemanagement and personnel, told the House Armed Servicessubcommittee on military personnel and compensation that failure ofCongress to agree to shift funds would be a disaster.   The director of the Congressional Budget Office, called beforethe subcommittee to testify about reshaping the military, said theDefense Department should be able to handle a quick reduction inforces.   ``It's do-able but extremely difficult,'' said Robert D.Reischauer.   The hearing focused on five alternative plans to restructureU.S. military forces in light of the dramatic changes in EasternEurope and the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet agreement to reducestrategic arms and conventional forces.   The CBO alternatives would reduce the annual defense budget bybetween $9 billion and $80 billion with cuts in active dutymanpower ranging from about 100,000 to almost 600,000.</TEXT></DOC>
