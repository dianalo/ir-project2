And lawmakers, taking the threat seriously, are consideringlegislation to keep the trains rolling.   The United Transportation Union is threatening to strikeThursday if Candamp;NW adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1,156UTU brakemen.   But neither side can act until a cooling-off period ordered byPresident Reagan ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4.   In his order _ which also blocked an April walkout and createdan emergency board to intervene in the case _ Reagan said a strikeagainst Candamp;NW could deprive several Midwestern states of essentialrail service and disrupt normal business activity in the Chicagoarea, where 40,000 commuters use its trains daily.   Negotiators for the company and Cleveland-based union met lastMonday and Tuesday at National Mediation Board headquarters inWashington but suspended their talks after making no progress.   ``For almost two years, we've been planning how we would operatein the event of a strike,'' said James Foote, vice president ofcommunications for CNW Corp. in Chicago, the railroad's parentcompany. ``We're ready.''   ``They didn't get what they wanted, so they don't intend to talkand intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on Aug. 4,''UTU President Fred Hardin said. ``If they take that position, thatleaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service.''   On July 1, the presidential emergency board proposed that Candamp;NWeliminate one brakeman per train and the other if approved by anarbitrator on a train-by-train basis. Both sides rejected the plan.   Foote said it might take an act of Congress to bring asettlement _ a sentiment echoed by Hardin. But both sides spentlast week lobbying vigorously against a bill introduced by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill., that would make the presidential board'srecommendations binding unless the parties reach agreement withouta strike.   The chairman of the House Energey and Commerce Committee'stransportation subcommittee, Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said themeasure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement byThursday.   ``This would be a crippling strike for commuters and manyagricultural interests, especially in these drought-strickentimes,'' Luken said. ``It's premature for us to consider any actionunless and until there would be a strike, but we intend to be in aposition to move very quickly.''   The railroad operates on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000employees in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.   It ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in revenue, generating$893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight.   ``We've cut our work force, cut expenses and improved ourproductivity dramatically,'' Foote said. ``But because ofcompetition and lower rates, our revenue per car has declined 26percent since 1982.''   Candamp;NW wants to save $51 million a year by cutting most of itstrain crews from four to two people, eliminating what it considersunnecessary brakemen's jobs and leaving an engineer and conductoron board.   ``We've made agreements in good faith with all the othercarriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and onebrakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman,'' saidHardin, whose union represents both brakemen and conductors. ``IfCandamp;NW were to win _ we have a strike and they're victorious _ thenthey'd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads.''   Hardin said he was not sure whether the UTU would extend astrike to other carriers, and he did not know if Candamp;NW employeesfrom 15 other unions would walk off the job in sympathy.   ``If it's a legal strike, our people would,'' said Jim Shell,vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers inCleveland. ``That's a matter of personal choice, whether a membercrosses their picket lines or not, but this organizationtraditionally has honored legal strikes.''   Foote said the company is ready if all its union workers walkout.   ``About 80 percent of our management people have been givenassignments that they will work if there's a strike,'' he said.``We also have a pool of approximately 8,000 former railroademployees who will work.''   Commuter trains would halt for the duration of the strike. ButFoote said management could operate enough trains from the firstday of a walkout to maintain about 80 percent of the railroad'snormal freight revenue, and replacement workers would be on the jobwithin days.</TEXT></DOC>
