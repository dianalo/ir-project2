ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wearing a tuxedo with a floppy bow tie, OliverL. North tackled ``Peter and the Wolf'' with the same gritty,square-jawed bravado that he mustered when he confronted hisIran-Contra inquisitors in a bemedaled Marine uniform.   This time, there was no quavering voice, no misty-eyed evocationof God, country and duty. Instead, North gave a lively,well-rehearsed narration of Sergei Prokofiev's classic musical talefor children, embroidered with nasty growls and reassuring smiles.   The audience of 1,000 Ollie oglers and music lovers _ includingNorth's probation officer _ greeted his musical stage debut in theCapital Hilton Hotel ballroom Friday night with cheers, applauseand flashing cameras.   He won the grownups, but he lost the kids. They sat on the frontrow squealing and shrieking at the costumed animals.   Oliver North, convicted felon in the Iran-Contra affair, wasupstaged by the big, bad wolf.   ``It was right nice,'' said Aquil Robinson, 12. ``What I likedbest was when the wolf ate the duck.''   ``Yeah, man,'' agreed his 6-year-old brother, Yusuf.   North clearly enjoyed his half-hour performance with a 46-pieceorchestra and dancers from the American Contemporary Ballet, thehighlight of a holiday concert sponsored by the Beethoven Society,a local musical group.   The retired Marine colonel and former White House nationalsecurity aide, who is appealing his May 4 conviction on threefelony charges, appeared onstage as a favor to Maria Fisher, an85-year-old cultural doyenne of Washington who is founder andpresident of the Beethoven Society.   Even though North reportedly charges $25,000 for every speech hemakes, Mrs. Fisher said he performed Friday night for free.   Mrs. Fisher said she admired North when she watched hisnationally televised testimony at the congressional Iran-Contrahearings in 1987. They became friends when they met later at a ballat the Organization of American States, she said.   About three months ago, she got the idea of introducingclassical music to inner-city children, and North accepted herinvitation to narrate ``Peter and the Wolf.''   ``When the word got out, people called me and said, `How dareyou? Shame on you. He's a criminal.' But it takes all sorts to makea world, doesn't it? Besides, he's a good friend of mine,'' shesaid.   In a pre-concert interview, Mrs. Fisher said: ``I don't knowabout his talents as a narrator, but I know he's got a goodspeaking voice. I watched those hearings and I'm sure he can read ascript.''   North said it was his first stage appearance since he performedin a high school production of ``How the West Was Won'' in hishometown of Philmont, N.Y., nearly 30 years ago.   ``I think I was the bad guy,'' he said.   The audience Friday night included North's probation officer,Ralph Ardito, and 100 youngsters from Save Our Youth, a private,non-profit anti-drug program for inner-city children where North iscarrying out his sentence of 1,200 hours of community service.   He also was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $150,000after his conviction of aiding and abetting an obstruction ofCongress, shredding government documents and accepting an illegalgratuity.   Ardito said North's stage appearance will not reduce hisrequired hours of community service, even though children from SaveOur Youth were in the audience.   Conductor Richard Weilenmann praised North for a ``very good''performance with nary a missed cue.   ``Some narrators are exaggerated and overblown, but he read verynaturally, as if he were reading to his own children,'' Weilenmannsaid.   Another enthusiast in the audience was Robert W. Owen, whoformerly was North's liaison with Nicaraguan Contra rebels duringthe clandestine attempt to channel military aid to theanti-Sandinista forces.   ``It was wonderful,'' said Owen, who brought his 2-year-olddaughter Katie. ``Ollie may have a new profession.''</TEXT></DOC>
