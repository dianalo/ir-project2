In fact, however, increased real outlayson defense capital accounted for a substantial portion ofincreased federal borrowing after 1978. But this is nothingto be ashamed of. It is appropriate for governments to borrowfor durable investments, like bridges or ships, just as itwould be for a private buyer of similar equipment.   The nearby graph compares outlays for defense capital withthe overall budget deficit, with both in constant 1982dollars (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Feb. 14, 1991).Annual investments in durable military equipment wereunusually modest from 1973 to 1978, averaging 59% below thepeacetime average of $53.8 billion from 1955 to 1964. Sincethose are annual figures, the cumulative impact on militaryhardware from 1973 to 1978 was substantial. Investments wereprobably not sufficient to replace worn-out equipment, muchless to update obsolete technology.</LP><TEXT>   Allowing the stock of military capital to run downundoubtedly helped hold down the measured budget deficit fora while, but it amounted to a form of borrowing from thefollowing decade. In the 1980s, the condition of U.S. defensebecame a hot political issue, and voters deliberatelyaccepted the cost of rebuilding the neglected stock ofmilitary hardware.   The growth of real tax receipts was relatively weak in thestagflationary '70s, growing by only 16.7% between 1969 and1979, compared with 29.5% from 1979 to 1989. Had it not beenfor the sharp drop of investment in military hardware from1973 to 1978, the weak growth of real tax receipts would haverevealed large deficits much earlier. Simply keeping nominaloutlays for defense capital at the real pre-Vietnam level of1963 would have raised the 1978 deficit to 3.9% of grossnational product from 2.7%. (The 1989 deficit was 2.9% ofGNP, despite a 57% increase in real defense investments since1978.)   Had it appeared politically and militarily feasible tokeep real defense capital outlays in 1989 as low as they werein 1978, the 1989 deficit would have been $53.9 billion lowerthan it was, or only 1.9% of GNP. The average deficit from1971 through 1979 was 2.5% of GNP, hitting 4.3% in 1976 --the year of the lowest real defense investments since 1951.   The cutback in capital outlays for defense in the 1970swas singularly inappropriate because we had abolished thehateful draft, which made human beings appear a lot cheaperthan they really are. Modern technology can, as we now seequite vividly, attain military objectives with a lower lossof life. Substituting capital for labor in defense has been avery good investment indeed.   It might seem that the military disinvestment of the '70smerely reduced the high expenditures of the Vietnam War.After all, it is repeatedly claimed that the war era was oneof &quot;guns and butter&quot; -- with supposedly huge budget deficitsfinancing lavish outlays on the Great Society and militaryhardware. Common wisdom, though, is not always true.   During the first three years of the war -- before thedisastrous surtax -- the deficit was only 0.6% of GNP. Somuch for the &quot;guns and butter&quot; myth about an inflation thatwas, in reality, due to a doubling of the Fed's stock ofTreasury bills during the '60s. During the Vietnam War,defense investments were above average only in 1968-69, andwere still well below the post-Korean level of 1954, and onlya fifth of the level of 1944. The relatively modest increasein defense capital during the Vietnam era was also offset bya 43% drop in nondefense capital -- more guns, less &quot;butter&quot;(infrastructure). By contrast, real spending on federalnondefense capital rose 45% from 1980 to 1989, despite acurrently fashionable belief to the contrary.   The myth about 1968-69 is relevant to the debate about howto pay for the current war. So is that period's effort tooffset an inflationary monetary policy with an extra marginaltax. It is worth remembering that real tax receipts fell 2.3%in fiscal 1968, that inflation and interest rates roserapidly after the surtax was imposed, and that the U.S.economy did not recover from the resulting recession untilthat surtax was repealed.   The issue at this point is not whether increased U.S.outlays on defense capital increased federal borrowing in thepast decade. Obviously, they did. Instead, the question iswhether this was a prudent and productive use of borrowedfunds. Economists cannot answer that question, any more thanthey can decide how much society should spend on burglaralarms and police. Security certainly does have value, and itis up to voters to decide how much to allocate to government-- provided security services, including defense.   One argument against such use of federal credit is thatdefense, unlike other &quot;infrastructure&quot; investments, is not&quot;productive&quot; in the sense of adding to the future quantity orquality of marketable goods and services. Taken literally,this argument implies that locks on our doors are likewisepure waste, not to mention alarms on houses and cars, FBIcomputers, prisons, police cars and pistols.   Reasonable people can differ about how much wealth needsto be devoted to such security services, or whether someprotective services could best be provided by public orprivate agencies. Reasonable people can likewise differ onthe proper mix of labor and capital. What does not seemreasonable, though, is to claim that capital equipment thatmakes people and property feel more secure over a period ofyears, including Patriot missiles and Stealth bombers, is notuseful capital.   Should capital for military security be financed by debtor current taxes? One argument for using debt is that much ofthis equipment will provide benefits to future citizens overmany years, so the cost should be spread over time by issuingbonds. To take an extreme example, it would not have been&quot;fiscally responsible&quot; for the U.S. to have passed upopportunities to buy Alaska, Louisiana and parts of theSouthwest just because it might have unbalanced the annualbudget. Battleships and bombers bought decades ago arelikewise proving quite useful today.   It has surely been justifiable to have issued bonds tofinance at least the net increase in military capital, thatportion that exceeds depreciation (which is extremely hard tomeasure). Using debt has permitted a rapid buildup of defensecapability from an unusually weak base, whereas an annuallimiting of outlays to cash on hand would not even havepermitted the Defense Department to replace ancient equipmentthat had to be scrapped.   Another reason for using debt to rebuild a depleted stockof military hardware is that rapid accumulations of hardwarehave typically proved temporary, yielding a &quot;peace dividend&quot;as society feels safe enough to rely on the existing,enlarged stock of equipment for quite a few years. Despitethe Iraq setback, this is likely to be true once again in the1990s.   To finance any such temporary surge in outlays with apermanent new tax makes no sense, but neither does atemporary tax. If tax rates were increased every timespending rose and revenues fell because of recession, forexample, people would soon learn to postpone productiveactivities until periods of booming activity, when the taxwould be lifted. The result would be an inefficient shift ofactivities between time periods, and a more volatile economy.   Instead, temporary outlays are properly financed by debtto avoid gyrations in tax policy. Using debt for whatHarvard's Robert Barro calls &quot;tax smoothing&quot; is particularlyappropriate when increases in government debt are accompaniedby increases in government assets, such as the current use ofdebt to acquire the assets of failed Sandamp;Ls, or the pastdecade's use of debt to acquire an obviously impressiveinventory of defense capital.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is director of economic research at theHudson Institute in Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
