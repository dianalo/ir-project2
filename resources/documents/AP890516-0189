Ricardo Alvarenga, of the rightist Republican NationalistAlliance, said the attack came from four people traveling in a reddouble-cabin pickup truck.   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, thethird in the past month on officials or supporters of the alliance,known as Arena. But Alvarenga said he blamed leftist guerrillas.   ``We were having lunch when a heard the gunfire,'' he said. ``Isaw one of the agents was wounded and sent him immediately to themilitary hospital.''   He said he did not know the agent's condition but that heappeared to be seriously wounded.   Three national policemen are on duty 24 hours a day atAlvarenga's home. He also has three bodybuards and two drivers.Some of them chased the assailants, but could not catch them, hesaid.   Alvarenga has opposed evacuation of about 100 wounded rebelfighters who are scheduled to leave the country in the next fewdays to receive medical treatment.   The evacuation is part of an agreement between the rebels andthe Christian Democratic government of President Jose NapoleonDuarte. About 350 rebels have left since 1984 under the program toreceive medical attention in Cuba, Sweden and East Germany.   ``We can't stop the evacuation, but we could take legal actionagainst those who let them leave,'' Alvarenga said recently.   Duarte said he wasn't intimidated by threats and that thegovernment was proceeding with the evacuations.   ``I believe the Salvadoran people understand my position andknow that I am doing what is just, humane and legal,'' he saidduring an impromptu news conference Tuesday.   Duarte's term expires June 1, when he turns the government overto President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of Arena.   On April 14, a bomb destroyed more than half the home ofFrancisco Merino, the vice president-elect, and one of his nieceswas injured.   Five days later Roberto Garcia Alvarado, chief federalprosecutor, was killed in a bombing. Although he is not a member ofArena, government officials said he was a party supporter.   Arena blamed both attacks on the guerrillas, fighting for nineyears to overthrow the U.S.-backed government. The guerrillas'Farbundo Marti National Liberation Front denied responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
