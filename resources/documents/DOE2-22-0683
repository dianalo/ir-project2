<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-22-0683 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for cooling is described comprising the steps of: (a) providinga cooling device; (b) opening the valve to permit communication betweenthe first chamber and the second chamber, whereby the pressure in thefirst chamber is reduced, causing the liquid to boil, forming a vapor,which vapor is directed through the conduit into the second chamber;(c) removing vapor from the second chamber by collecting same in thesorbent until an equilibrium condition is reached, wherein the sorbentis substantially saturated or substantially all of the liquid originallyin the first chamber has been collected in the sorbent; and (d) substantiallyinhibiting heat from the sorbent from escaping from the self-containedapparatus. The inhibiting step comprising: providing, in thermal communicationwith the sorbent, a material for removing heat from the sorbent, andremoving heat from the sorbent by means of the heat removing materialwhile the sorbent is removing liquid vapor from the first chamber.</TEXT></DOC>
