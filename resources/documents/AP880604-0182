The gunmen, holed up in the bank since their foiled robberyattempt Thursday, released 11 of their 12 remaining hostages duringtheir brief flight before returning to the bank, said Guaraci Abreu,police chief of Goiere.   They were inside the bank's safe, holding the bank manager astheir last hostage, and demanded an armored truck to attempt anotherescape, possibly overnight, Abreu said.   After a 35-hour police siege the authorities in Goiere, a smallrural town in Parana state located 550 miles southwest of Rio deJaneiro, agreed to give the bandits the equivalent of $100,000 incash and a car in exchange for eight of the remaining twelvehostages.   The robbers originally took two guards and 24 other employeeshostage, but by Saturday morning all but 12 either were graduallyreleased during negotiations with the police or escaped.   Abreu the thieves released eight hostages one by one earlySaturday morning and after receiving the money they took off in thecar with the other four.   Three hostages were freed passing the town's limits but themanager was kept as driver, Abreu said in a telephone interview.   ``One hour later the two bandits and their hostage were back atthe bank complaining that the car had not fuel enough to gofurther,'' he said.   About sixty state troopers who were about to start chasing thefugitives surrounded the bank again.   Antonio Lopes Noronha, state justice secretary, told reporters:``I guess we now just have to wait. The time is on our side and theydo not have steel nerves.''</TEXT></DOC>
