It bears no resemblance to the presidency of GeorgeBush.;   What did people expect from George Bush in 1988, when they voted forhim in huge numbers? And now, three years later, why do they seem to yearn formore leadership than he has delivered?;   Like Ronald Reagan before him, Bushsought from the outset to lower Americans' expectations of what he couldaccomplish. And for most of Bush's first term, Americans seemed to feel thatthis minimalist approach was just fine.;   But now, jarred by the sour economyand confronted by a massive budget deficit that leaves little room for newdomestic spending, the public appears edgy at best, miserable at worst anddissatisfied overall.;   Absent anybody else on the horizon, Americans expecttheir president to make things better -- particularly a world leader who hasraised expectations with his commanding performance in the Persian Gulf warand his ability to bring Middle East enemies to the peace table.;   'It'sreally not enough';   &quot;For the first time, we're starting to say it's reallynot enough to do things well in the rest of the world,&quot; said politicalscientist Philippa Strum of City University of New York's Brooklyn College.;  Even Bush partisans, such as Bill Kacal, a Houston accountant, say it's timefor Bush to start emphasizing home front concerns.;   &quot;We had a global crisis.Now we've got to work on our domestic issues,&quot; Kacal said.;   With Congresscontrolled by Democrats, that will be hard for Bush to do. He has never shownmuch interest in domestic policy, and his early political capital has eroded.Presidents typically have their greatest successes with Congress in theirfirst year -- not their fourth, when the opposition party is working mightilyto unseat them.;   Slouched in his chair in the Oval Office recently, Bushseemed unfazed by this new mood of public discontent. Compared to JimmyCarter, who appeared overburdened by the demands of the office, and RichardNixon, who became a virtual prisoner of the place, Bush appeared entirely atease in the imposing room.;   He said he saw no need to shift policydirections, even with the sluggish economy. &quot;I'm just going to stay thecourse,&quot; he told reporters.;   The next day the stock market plunged 41points. Some analysts blamed the drop on his answer.;   It wasn't supposed tobe this way. At this point in his first term, things were supposed to be goingnothing but right for George Bush.;   Only a few months ago, this was the Bushadministration's scenario for 1992: Aloft on the shoulders of a gratefulnation, basking in the glow of the Persian Gulf victory, the surge ofdemocracy throughout Eastern Europe, the end of communism in the Soviet Unionand the glimmer of Middle East peace, Bush would be cruising toward a secondterm.;   All of this would come on top of a rebounding economy -- as had beenpredicted by a battery of smart economists in and out of government.;  Instead, economic news is lousy, and Bush's poll numbers, which he studieswith an accountant's precision, are falling.;   For the first time, Bush isvulnerable, his re-election in doubt and his performance under increasinglysharp criticism.;   &quot;Historically, he will be a relatively minor figure,&quot;predicted Colin Campbell, a Georgetown University political science professorand co-editor of &quot;The Bush Presidency: First Appraisals.&quot;;   Bush compared toHoover;   No president since Herbert Hoover has had a smaller role in domesticaffairs, Campbell said.;   In some respects, this newly vulnerable Bush is thevictim of his own success abroad.;   If we can find the money for a war inIraq, for hungry ex-Communist Soviets, for Kurdish refugees, why do we have toscrimp and slash on housing, schools and unemployment benefits?;   &quot;In thecourse of the Persian Gulf war, (the invasion of) Panama and so on, I thinkthat somehow the feeling was that he could work miracles,&quot; Rutgers Universitypolitical scientist Ross Baker said.;   &quot;This is the only president we've had,since we've had polling data, who won a war. I don't think any of usappreciated what that can do to . . . change (increase) expectations,&quot;Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said. &quot;They expect initiative, they expectsomeone to have a plan, especially when we're in trouble.&quot;;   These largerexpectations are a new phenomenon for Bush. His approach to the domestic sideof his presidency has been to react to events and to polls, not to innovate.;  When he came into office three years ago, those polls showed that voterswanted things to continue as they were. Bush was elected on a platform thatwas essentially more of the same but nicer: Reagan-with-Rounded-Edges.;   Bushtailored his presidency to that first set of expectations: Handlinginternational crises as they came along and continuing Reagan's limitedgovernment, making it somehow more compassionate -- &quot;kinder and gentler&quot;--without spending much more money.;   The only substantive campaign promisesBush made in his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention werethe now infamous &quot;Read My Lips, No New Taxes&quot; and a promise to create 30million jobs during the next eight years.;   Broken promises;   Last year, hewelshed on the tax promise. And after three years, only 259,000 new jobs havebeen created -- less than 1 percent of his goal.;   Now, people say that theywant change, that the country is headed in the wrong direction. For Bush,focusing on domestic issues is the bad medicine of being president.;   You cansee it in his face. Discussing world events and his role in shaping them, Bushis animated, lively, engaged, a happy man.;   When he must turn to domesticissues -- the economy, homelessness, civil rights, drugs, crime, spendingabroad when people are hurting at home -- he is defensive, rambling andlooking to pin the blame on somebody else, most often &quot;carping&quot; Democrats and&quot;liberals&quot; in Congress.;   Blaming the Democrats;   For example, Bush and hisadvisers assert that the economy would be humming along if it weren't for theDemocrats.;   But that contention is dubious.;   It is far from apparent thatthe current economic and domestic landscape would be much different if all ofBush's economic proposals were enacted tomorrow by Congress.;   Unlike Reagan,who pushed sweeping tax and spending changes, Bush has limited his economicplan to cutting capital gains taxes, expanding Individual Retirement Accounts,extending tax credits for business research and development and other minoradjustments.;   &quot;Whatever the merits of any of those proposals, they wouldhave made very little difference to the performance of the economy,&quot; saidBruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York.;   'Extremelyunwise things';   &quot;The problem is that he is inheriting the legacy of the lasteight years of economic policy. We did some extremely unwise things, likerunning incredibly huge budget deficits, and eventually that elicits a price,&quot;Steinberg said.;   Bush rightly attributes much of his foreign policy successto a president's ability to exercise leadership in the international arenawithout facing many constraints from Congress.;   But that has been true formost modern presidents. Nixon demonstrated it in opening ties with China,Carter in bringing Israel and Egypt together. The tough part has always beenproviding leadership at home.;   Rather than grapple with issues such ashealth policy, Bush has displayed a preference for talking about politicallyappealing domestic issues over which he has relatively little authority.;  For example, Bush has said he wants to be the &quot;education president&quot; andregularly visits schools for speeches and photo opportunities. Yet the federalrole in elementary and secondary education is marginal. Only about 6 percentof the funding comes from the federal government; state and local leaders playa more important role.;   Likewise, people listening to Bush's frequentreferences to his crime bill might conclude that the federal government has aprominent role to play in crime fighting. In fact, about 94 percent ofcriminal convictions are handled at the state and local level, according togovernment figures.;   Resistance to Congress;   On domestic issues in whichthe federal government plays a more central role, Bush often has resistedworking with Congress until political events force him to do so. Recentexamples: agreements on the Civil Rights Act and an extension of unemploymentbenefits.;   In confronting domestic issues, Bush and his aides have seemed tofocus less attention on pushing policy initiatives through Congress than inblocking Democratic bills from becoming law.;   They point with pride toBush's string of 24 vetoes without having a single one overridden during hispresidency.;   What administration officials don't mention is that Bush'ssuccess rate in convincing Congress to support his programs is the lowest ofany president since Congressional Quarterly began measuring the rates in 1953,seven presidents ago.;   The result has been a domestic standoff. Neither Bushnor Congress has displayed enough clout to shift the course of governmentpolicies. With distrust between the two branches high, nothing suggests thatthe stalemate will end anytime soon.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ELLEN WARREN AND CHARLES GREEN, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,635  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 2, 199100337150,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
