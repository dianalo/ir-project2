Mayor Tom Bradley was a key player in the lobbying effort, theLos Angeles Times reported Wednesday, by persuading thecongressional delegation from California to intervene on behalf ofDrexel.   The result was three similarly worded letters from members ofCongress to SEC Chairman David Ruder demanding that the agencyabandon efforts to force Drexel to move its high-yield bonddepartment from Beverly Hills to the firm's New York headquarters,the Times said.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,each wrote letters on Drexel's behalf and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-LosAngeles, wrote a third letter signed by six other Los Angeles-arealawmakers, the report said.   The six congressmen were identified as Reps. Howard Berman, MelLevine, David Dreier, Carlos Moorhead, Julian C. Dixon and AugustusF. Hawkins.   At least seven of the nine members of Congress have receivedcampaign contributions or honorariums from Drexel, the Times said.   Drexel representatives asked the three members of Congress toexpress objections to an SEC demand that the firm move its so-called``junk bond'' high-yield operation which had been headed by MichaelMilken, the key target of the federal fraud investigation.   The firm has said that dismantling the junk bond unit wouldseverely hurt Drexel's leading role in the lucrative market forthese securities, commonly used to finance takeovers or financegrowth of small and medium-size takeovers.   Drexel agreed Dec. 21 to pay the government $650 million in finesand restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settleaccusations of securities fraud.   The plea bargain also requires Drexel to settle relatedlitigation with the SEC, which filed civil fraud charges against thefirm last Sept. 7.</TEXT></DOC>
