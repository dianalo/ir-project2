Added Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women'sPolitical Caucus: ``We need a response beyond window dressing.''   The caucus is among more than two dozen women's groups, rangingfrom Church Women United to the National Abortion Rights ActionLeague, mounting an intensive lobbying drive for the Family andMedical Leave Act. It is scheduled for a House vote next Wednesday.   The bill has 151 co-sponsors, but only 16 of them areRepublicans. Compromises are being discussed with conservativelawmakers, many of them southern Democrats, as supporters attemptto secure a majority for the bill before the floor vote.   The act would require businesses employing more than 50 peopleto offer unpaid job-protected leave of at least 10 weeks to parentsof newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children. At least 15weeks would have to be available to employees suffering a seriousillness themselves. An ``elder care'' provision would permit leavesto care for seriously ill parents.   The elder care section is likely to die either in the House orlater in the Senate, supporters acknowledge, and the bill mayultimately guarantee workers a single 12-week leave for eitherillness or parental responsibilities.   Lichtman cited several cases that illustrate why the legislationis needed. She described a baker who lost his job because he tookoff a day to be with his daughter during her heart operation; apostal worker denied a week of unpaid leave after his wife hadtwins, and a hospital supply technician who returned from anapproved maternity leave to be told her job was gone.   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has endorsed thefamily leave bill. The Reagan administration opposes it but onewomen's group official said Vice President George Bush, the GOPnominee, was re-evaluating his position late last week.   ``We think the Bush campaign is showing some very good signs,''said Linda Dorian, executive director of the bipartisan NationalFederation of Business and Professional Women. ``There is room forsome productive dialogue on this.''   Small businesses are planning a major lobbying effort next weekagainst the family leave measure.   ``What plant closings was to large business, this is to smallbusiness,'' said Mary Tavenner, a founder of the 160-memberConcerned Alliance of Responsible Employers. ``It's even moredangerous. ... They're telling America's employers, `We don't carewho needs it and who doesn't, this is what you've got to do,whether or not you can afford it.'''</TEXT></DOC>
