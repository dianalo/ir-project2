White</HL><DATE>05/21/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><LP>   H. Ross Perot, billionaire, Eagle Scout, folk hero andbureaucracy basher is no St. Francis.   Just ask his former colleagues at Electronic Data SystemsCorp., the data processing firm he founded then sold toGeneral Motors Corp. in one of the most celebrated andtumultuous deals of the merger-happy 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   EDS veterans know a different Mr. Perot from the onecelebrated in song and in mini-series. They know a sharp-eyedTexas deal-maker who slipped GM a mickey in the agreementthat went with the auto maker's $700 million buy-out in 1986;a ruthless enemy who uses the press and his political cloutto savage those who cross him; a media spin-master whocultivates a homespun populist image one minute and the nextdrops the full weight that comes with a multibillion dollarfortune on two hapless Dallas police officers who caught hisdaughter-in-law with a pistol in her car. (The officers lether go, but according to the Dallas Times-Herald, Mr. Perot&quot;chewed them out&quot; anyway.)   It is this less-attractive side of Mr. Perot that BusinessWeek writer Todd Mason sets out to expose in his &quot;Perot: AnUnauthorized Biography&quot; (Dow Jones-Irwin, 316 pages, $19.95).Mr. Mason, who covered Mr.Perot and EDS while he was BusinessWeek's Dallas bureau chief, doggedly pursues his thesis thatthe man lionized for championing Vietnam prisoners of war,defying Iranian hostage-takers and sassing GM Chairman RogerB. Smith, has more than a little clay on his shoes.   After Mr. Perot refused to cooperate, Mr. Mason turned toaggrieved former colleagues, childhood acquaintances,transcripts and newspaper clippings from Mr. Perot's 1989court battle with EDS, and passages from hitherto-sealeddepositions by GM Chairman Smith and others to put togetherhis unflattering profile.   Unfortunately, Mr. Mason's poorly edited book is asimperfect as his subject. Chapter Four, for example, startsout promising details of how Mr. Perot fought the SocialSecurity Administration in the late 1960s to block theagency's effort to audit EDS's books. Social Securityofficials were concerned that EDS was making an undeservedkilling processing state Medicare claims.   But in the third paragraph, Mr. Mason lurches almost adecade forward in time to late 1978 and Mr. Perot's exploitsin Iran. After two EDS executives were thrown in an Iranianprison on trumped up charges, Mr. Perot whipped into shape agroup of employees to free them. Seven pages later, Mr.Perot's ad-hoc commandos have beaten the odds to liberatetheir colleagues and it's back to the Social SecurityAdministration.   For those who press on, there is some reward when Mr.Mason retells the story of Mr. Perot's bitter split with Mr.Smith, and his subsequent decision to launch a new company,Perot Systems Corp., to compete with his old friends at EDS.Mr. Mason delivers a clear-eyed account of the eventssurrounding GM's controversial $700 million buy-out of Mr.Perot, aided by the abundance of testimony and documentationthat spilled out of the Virginia courtroom where Mr. Perotand EDS locked horns last year. That dispute focused on Mr.Perot's claim that GM's buy-out left him free to hire awayEDS personnel and woo EDS clients.   Mr. Mason reports, for example, that Mr. Perot never putthe $700 million he got from GM in an escrow account to allowthe auto maker to change its decision, although he said hehad at the time. And he attacks the prescriptions Mr. Perotoffered for GM in a 1988 Fortune magazine article as &quot;lighton specifics and long on leadership generalizations.&quot;   Mr. Mason's got the right idea. Mr. Perot's powers ofpersuasion, whether focused on a huge company or a singlereporter, are wondrous. But a less-gifted individual whotried his simplistic problem-solving methods or his batteringram approach to critics would quickly come a cropper.   In fact, Mr. Perot himself is discovering that noteveryone cares for his mix of charm and bluster. Afterdetails of his lucrative, no-bid contract to automate theU.S. Postal Service got out in 1988, Mr. Perot got a painfulreminder that even billionaires sometimes have to play by therules. EDS tied up the deal in so many administrativeprotests that Postmaster General Anthony Frank finallyabandoned it.   The problem is that despite all the information Mr. Masonhas collected, his book doesn't add much sting to a tale thathas been told to death. All that's really new is that noweach of the two sides in the Perot-EDS feud has a book.   Mr. Perot has the sympathetic portrait in &quot;IrreconcilableDifferences,&quot; a gossipy 1989 account of his clash with Mr.Smith written by former Wall Street Journal reporter Doron P.Levin, now Detroit bureau chief for the New York Times. EDShas Mr. Mason's dry indictment. Readers without an ax togrind probably will prefer Mr. Levin's smoothly told yarn,even though Mr. Mason is closer to the truth.   ---   Mr. White is a staff reporter in the Journal's Detroitbureau. He covered the litigation between Mr. Perot and EDSin 1988 and 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
