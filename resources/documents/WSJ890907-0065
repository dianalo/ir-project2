The drug relies on recombinant DNA technology.    Merck andamp; Co. already has a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine on the U.S. market. An official of London-based SmithKline said Energix-B would be less expensive than Merck's drug and would require less time to administer. Details about SmithKline's U.S. marketing plans for the drug are scheduled to be discussed tomorrow at a news conference in New York, the official said.    Hepatitis B, a blood-borne disease that is considered even more contagious than AIDS, infects about 300,000 Americans a year and kills about 5,000 of them annually. According to the World Health Organization, there are about 285 million chronic carriers of the disease, all of whom risk developing liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. </TEXT></DOC>
