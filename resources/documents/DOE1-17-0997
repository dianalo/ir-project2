We review briefly the current status of the''technology'' of such calculations. We then consider in some detailone example of current work, in which wave functions for all sd-shellnuclear states have been obtained from a shell-model calculation whichemploys an empirical Hamiltonian and the complete set of 0d5/2-1s1/2-0d3/2basis vectors. We examine the electromagnetic matrix elements calculatedfrom these wave functions in a variety of contexts to demonstrate howthis theoretical approach works and to elluminate important issues incurrent nuclear structure research.</TEXT></DOC>
