Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady refused to answer specificquestions about a published report detailing elements of the planthe administration has under review. He told reporters aftercongressional testimony on the Bush budget that questions aboutThird World debt would be answered at an upcoming hearing.   Art Siddon, a Treasury Department spokesman, said the TreasuryDepartment had completed its review and officials were examiningpossible changes but that no final decisions had been made.   Siddon said he could not comment on a Washington Post story whichsaid the administration's plan would put heavy emphasis onencouraging banks to voluntarily forgive part of the debt owed tothem by developing nations.   The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying that the planunder consideration by the administration would emphasize reducingthe size of outstanding debt and would tap the resources of theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank to make it moreattractive for banks to forgive a portion of their loans.   In a speech last week, Brady termed Third World debt ``perhapsthe most difficult'' of the major issues facing the newadministration.   ``Unlike the federal budget deficit or even the savings and loanindustry crisis, this is not a problem that we in the U.S. have thepower or the resources to solve by ourselves,'' Brady said in aspeech to the American Bankers Association.   The new administration is receiving pressure from U.S. allies togo beyond the ``Baker plan,'' formulated by Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III in 1985 when he was Treasury secretary in the Reaganadministration.   Under the Baker plan, the international banking community was toprovide about $30 billion in new loans to Third World debtors whoagreed to make economic reforms.   However, the amount of new bank lending fell far short of thegoals and as a result there has been growing pressure for a newapproach that would reduce the debt burden.   That pressue intensified last week after riots in Venezuela whichwere touched off after the newly elected government of PresidentCarlos Andres Perez announced austerity measures as part of anagreement with the International Monetary Fund to get more loans forthe debt-strapped country.   In another development Tuesday, the Twentieth Century Fundreleased a report calling for the Bush administration to supportmajor new initiatives to resolve the debt crisis.   ``The long shadow cast by the debt crisis covers far more thanthe economies of the debtor countries,'' the report concluded. ``Itthreatens democratic institutions in debtor countries, strainsNorth-South relations and poses serious political risks forcreditors as well as debtors.''   The report, prepared by a 12-member task force of businessleaders, politicians and academics, recommended extention andflexible rescheduling of existing interest payments as ways ofreducing the $1.3 trillion debt burden carried by the Third World.   John Gaines Heimann, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch CapitalMarkets and the head of the task force, said he hoped the Bushadministration would go further than the Baker plan in addressingthe debt problem.   ``The administration seems to be taking a very pragmatic point ofview and I hope that is evidenced in their set of recommendations,''he said.   The Twentieth Century Fund is a non-partisan research group whichhas conducted a two-year study of Third World debt.</TEXT></DOC>
