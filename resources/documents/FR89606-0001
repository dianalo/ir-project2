The original comment period was to end March 31, 1988,but it was informally extended to June 30, 1988, at the request of someof the parties. A total of four comments were received from the GeneralAccounting Office, the GAO Career Level Council, the GAO chapter of Blacksin Government, and the PAB General Counsel. Comprehensive comments werereceived from GAO. The other organizations had comments that related onlyto a few of the sections of the proposed rule. For the most part, the new rule makes no significant changes in the overallfunctions of the Board, but rather deals with procedural matters. Overthe years, the Board has developed methods for dealing with a wide varietyof procedural issues. These methods were developed based upon the needsof our system and with reference to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedureand the rules of our counterparts in the executive branch, in particularthe MSPB and, to some extent, the EEOC. The object of these rule changesis to codify these various procedures in order to provide clear and conciseguidance to the parties on procedural issues that we have found by experienceare apt to arise in cases before the Board. Thus, for example, some ofthe major additions proposed here deal with subjects such as discovery,evidence at hearing, motions practice, subpoenas, and interlocutory appeals.The rule defines the jurisdiction of the Board at andSection; 28.2. Thisdefinition distinguishes between actions brought by employees and applicantsfor employment, on the one hand, and actions brought by the General Counsel,on the other hand. The rule does not change the scope of jurisdiction,but merely states in one section what has been in effect throughout varioussections in the past. At andSection; 28.2(b)(1), the words ``officer or employee''is inserted to comport with the statutory language of 31 U.S.C. 753(a)(1).A number of definitions are added at andSection; 28.3. With one exception,the definitions are self-explanatory. In the past, the Board has used theterms ``Presiding Member'' and ``Hearing Officer'' to refer to individualswho conduct hearings for the Board. In recent years, the EEOC and the MSPBhave adopted the term ``administrative judge.'' In order to use one termthat is familiar to practitioners, the Board is adopting the term ``administrativejudge.'' The former rule at andSection; 28.9 required GAO to regularly advise employeesof their appeal rights to the Board, particularly when the employee wasthe object of an adverse action. The proposed rule at andSection; 28.10(a)added a requirement for proof of service ``such as a properly signed registeredmail receipt or a certificate of service with the employee's signatureacknowledging receipt.'' One comment states that the effect of the languagein this subsection is to make the agency's power to take an adverse actiondependent upon the agency's ability to show proof of service. However,the Board's intent with this language is merely to insure proof of serviceof appeal rights when any adverse or performance-based action is taken.Therefore, the proposed language requiring proof of service is retained.However, in response to expressed concern, the proposed language, quotedabove, which suggests forms for the proof of service, is deleted from thefinal rule at andSection; 28.10(a). The proposed rule at andSection; 28.10(b)(3) required GAO to give employees,who were the objects of an adverse or performance-based action, notice``of any applicable rights such as the right to representation and rightto a hearing.'' One comment noted that this language is vague and ambiguous.The comment is well taken, and the corrections made reflect our agreementwith the comment. In the past, andSection;andSection; 28.11(b)(4) and 28.47(b)(2) of the Board'srule allowed an employee to file a charge involving an EEO matter withthe General Counsel when there was no agency decision and ``80'' days hadpassed since the filing of the formal EEO complaint in the agency process.These same rules apply in the executive branch, except that the waitingperiod for filing prior to an agency decision is 180 days. In draftingthe proposed rule, the Board concluded that the 80 day period was undulyshort. A comment urged that at GAO most cases should be capable of processingwithin four months and, likewise, that six months was excessive processingtime for most cases. The Board accepts this suggestion and andSection;andSection;28.11(b)(4) and 28.98(b)(2) now provide a period of 120 days. On the other hand, the rule provides that when the agency issues an EEOdecision, the complainant has 20 days in which to file with the Board'sGeneral Counsel. One comment suggested that that period should be extendedto 30 days. We declined that suggestion. This 20 day appeal period is consistentwith this Board's other appeal periods for issues such as adverse actionsand prohibited personnel practices. It is also consistent with the appealperiods in the executive branch from agency actions to the MSPB and fromfinal agency decisions to the EEOC. In the past we have followed a particular set of steps for promulgatinga rule and changes to a rule. This procedure, however, has never been definedspecifically. Therefore, andSection; 28.16 was created to define the processfor amending or revoking this rule. Some years ago the Board established an internal policy for grievancesand complaints which are brought by employees of the Board against theBoard or the General Counsel. Section 28.17(a) places that policy in theBoard's rule. This procedure provides a mechanism whereby Board employeesreceive the same right to outside review in their adverse action, performance-basedaction or EEO complaint as GAO employees receive by appealing to this Board.One comment argued that the Board is not empowered to delegate its authorityto arbitrators or other non-Board members. The comment urged that the Boardmust preserve its ``decisionmaking responsibility.'' However, the Boarddoes not regard this provision as relating to its ``decision-making responsibility''at GAO. This provision, dealing as it does with the Board's staff ratherthan with GAO staff, involves the statutory responsibility of the Chairmanof the Board to act as ``chief executive and administrative officer ofthe Board.'' 31 U.S.C. 752(a). After careful consideration, the Board hasconcluded that this provision for providing to Board staff the same rightsthat are enjoyed by GAO employees is consistent with the spirit and intentof the GAO Personnel Act of 1980. Section 28.18(d) describes the requirements for filing a petition for reviewwith the Board. One comment urged that this section be modified to bringit into accord with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and to requirea petition for review to be stated in a legal context. The Board rejectedthese suggestions. The rule already allows the Board to follow the specificguidance of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure whenever it seems appropriate.As to making the petition for review a more legalistic document, it isthe Board's intention to keep the process open to unrepresented employeesas much as possible. Furthermore, the discovery process provides ampleopportunity for both parties to understand the context of the opposingparty's case. Therefore, more legalistic requirements for filing a petitionfor review seems unnecessary and possibly counterproductive.The prior rule of the Board provided at andSection; 28.19(f) that eitherparty to a proceeding had a right to a hearing before the Board. The proposedrule, at andSection;andSection; 28.18(f) and 28.21(c), changed the provisionso that the employee/applicant would continue to have a right to a hearing.However, a request by GAO for a hearing could be granted at the discretionof the administrative judge. One comment argued that there was no basisfor denying GAO a right to a hearing. The Board rejected this argument.Agencies have no right to a hearing in EEO complaints or in MSPB proceedingsin the executive branch. Only employees or, in EEO cases, applicants foremployment, have a right to a hearing. The Board's intention is to makethe right to a hearing consistent with the executive branch processes.Since the right to a hearing rule is different in unfair labor practiceproceedings before the FLRA, the Board added language to this subsectionto mirror the FLRA rule. However, in response to the concern expressedby this comment, the Board is requiring in this rule that any time a requestfor hearing by GAO is denied, there must be a statement of the basis forthe denial. The Board has jurisdiction over class actions that raise EEO issues andclass actions that raise non-EEO issues. One comment noted that the languageof the proposed rule regarding the standards for certifying EEO class actionswas different from the language for certifying non-EEO class actions. Itis the Board's intention that the requirements of the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure be used as a guide in both types of class actions. Therefore,the provision for non-EEO class actions at andSection; 28.18(g) and the provisionfor EEO class actions at andSection; 28.97(e) both make reference to thestandards in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Numerous changes relate to filing time limits. The proposed rule at andSection;28.20(c) required that responses to all pleadings be filed within 10 daysfrom receipt. In response to arguments presented in two comments, the Boardchanged this time limit to 20 days. The proposed rule at andSection; 28.53(b)required that motions to correct a transcript be filed within 15 days ofreceipt of the transcript. Also in response to comments, the Board changedthis 15 day period to 30 days. In this final rule, this time limit nowappears at andSection; 28.58(b). Finally, the proposed rule at andSection;28.82(a) required that a party file interlocutory appeals within 5 daysafter receipt of the administrative judge's determination. In responseto comments, this time limit is set at 10 days. Other time limits set in the proposed rule are unchanged in the final rule.For example, motions to compel discovery must be filed within 10 days afteran objection to discovery is filed (andSection; 28.42(d)(4)); responses topetitions for review must be filed within 20 days after receipt (andSection;28.19(a)); and requests for reconsideration must be filed within 30 daysfrom issuance of the initial decision (andSection; 28.87(b)). As suggested by one comment, language was added at the end of andSection;28.21(a) to provide standards for the exercise of the Board's or administrativejudge's discretion in allowing amendments to a petition for review. The proposed rule provided at andSection; 28.21(b) that once a motion anda response to the motion had been filed, no further responses may be filedby either party without permission of the administrative judge. Thoughone comment urged that a reply to the response should be allowed, the finalrule leaves this provision unchanged. Whether replies will be allowed isat the discretion of the administrative judge. The former rule at andSection; 28.19(g) provided that when the PAB GeneralCounsel was party to a settlement agreement during the General Counsel'sinvestigative phase, the settlement agreement was dispositive of the case.The intent of this provision was to make it clear that the General Counselwas not required to seek Board approval of a settlement that was reachedduring this investigative stage of the procedures. This provision was carriedinto the proposed rule at andSection; 28.21(d). One comment suggested changesthat would have extended to settlements not involving the PAB General Counsel.These suggestions were rejected because they would have substantially departedfrom the original, more narrow purpose of the provision. Section 28.22(b)(6) allows the administrative judge to exclude from thehearing any witness whose later testimony might be colored by testimonyof other witnesses or any persons whose presence might have a chillingeffect on a testifying witness. One comment sought to modify this provisionso as to allow the GAO attorney to designate a management agent who wouldstand in place of the Comptroller General as respondent and who could attendall sessions of the hearing as a matter of right. The Board rejected thissuggestion since it does not appear to be a widely accepted practice inother federal personnel administrative forums. However, in response tothe comment, the rule now reflects at andSection; 28.57(b) that four individualshave a right to be present in a hearing: the GAO technical representative,who is not expected to testify, the GAO representative, the petitionerand the petitioner's representative. This, we believe, does conform withpractice in administrative proceedings in the executive branch. Otherwise,the decision of who shall be excluded from the hearing is properly leftto the discretion of the administrative judge. The language as writtendoes not affect the substantive rights of either party to request thatany particular person or witness be excluded or included at the hearing.The former rule at andSection; 28.17(f) provided that when the PAB GeneralCounsel was not participating in a case, the General Counsel could requestpermission to intervene in the case with regard to any issue in which theGeneral Counsel finds a significant public interest with regard to thepreservation of the merit system. This provision for permissive interventionby the General Counsel carried over to the proposed rule at andSection; 28.12(f).However, the proposed rule also added language at andSection; 28.27 thatwould have allowed the PAB General Counsel to intervene in Board proceedingsas a matter of right. This provision is based upon the MSPB rule that grantsthe Special Counsel the right to intervene in proceedings before the MSPB.One comment pointed out that the provision for permissive interventionat andSection; 28.12(f) and the provision for intervention as a matter ofright at andSection; 28.27 were in conflict. The comment also argued that,except for the General Counsel's limited intervention under andSection; 28.12(f),the concept of intervention serves no useful purpose in proceedings beforethe Board. The comment argued that no one other than the General Counselshould be allowed to seek intervention. The noted conflict between andSection;andSection; 28.12(f) and 28.27 is welltaken. The General Counsel's right to intervene is, therefore, deletedfrom andSection; 28.27. With the General Counsel's broad scope of authorityin our system, permissive intervention is appropriate in those rare circumstancesin which the General Counsel may find it appropriate to participate ina case in which the General Counsel is not already participating. As towhether the rule should provide for intervention by other parties, we agreethat circumstances warranting such intervention may be rare. However, theMSPB rule provides for such intervention by other persons (see 5 CFR 1201.34)and defining appropriate grounds for granting such intervention is betterleft to development by case law. When the Board's rule was amended some years ago, provisions were addedto clarify the General Counsel's investigative, disciplinary, and correctiveaction authority. These provisions now appear at andSection;andSection; 28.130through 28.133. Although these provisions made paragraphs (c) and (d) inandSection; 28.33 of the former rule redundant, the two paragraphs were notremoved when the rule was last revised. These two paragraphs are now eliminatedfrom the rule. Section 28.42 of the proposed rule provided guidance on the proceduresgoverning discovery. Comments on this section argued that the time limitsfor initiating discovery and responding to discovery requests were tooshort and were not consistent with MSPB practice and that the requirementsimposed on a party seeking a subpoena to show the ``relevance, scope andmateriality of the particular information sought'' was not consistent withthe requirements in federal civil practice. These comments were all welltaken and appropriate changes are made in the final rule.The subject of discovery from a nonparty is described at andSection; 28.42(b).Nonparty includes anyone who is not an officer or employee of GAO. Therule provides that when voluntary discovery fails, then an order compellingdiscovery and a subpoena may be issued by the administrative judge. Onecomment suggested that the rule should be crafted to empower the Boardto use sanctions such as not admitting evidence covered by the order asan alternative to proceeding to enforce the subpoena. In response to thiscomment, the discussion in andSection; 28.42(b) of orders compelling discoveryand subpoenas was deleted. Particularly by removing the reference to subpoenas,there should be less opportunity for the discovery process and the subpoenaprocess to be confused. At the same time, by placing the subpoena provisions(see andSection;andSection; 28.46 through 28.50) immediately after the discoveryprovisions (see andSection; 28.40 through 28.45), it should be clear thatboth processes are available as the Board deems appropriate. The proposed rule provided that once a hearing date was set by the Boardor its administrative judge, motions for postponement would have to bein writing and accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the reasons forthe request. The motion would be granted only upon a showing of good cause.A comment urged that such written motions be required only when the partiesdo not agree on the need for a postponement. When the parties agree onthe need for postponement, the comment suggested that the motion be madeorally and that the motion be granted unless extraordinary circumstanceswere present. The Board modified the provision at andSection; 28.55 to allowmotions to be made orally when the parties are in agreement on the requestedpostponement. However, the motion can be granted only upon a showing ofgood cause. The former rule at andSection; 28.21(g) made Board hearings closed to thepublic unless the petitioner, usually the employee party in the hearing,requested that the hearing be open. The proposed rule at andSection; 28.57reversed this position. Hearings would be open unless there was an interestto be served by closing the hearing to the public. One comment urged thatthe prior rule remain unchanged since such personnel matters should remainconfidential. However, since Board decisions are open to the public, Boardhearings should normally be open to the public also. Public hearings arealso consistent with MSPB practice. See 5 CFR 1201.52. The proposed rule provided at andSection; 28.53 that a verbatim transcriptof the hearing would be made available to the parties upon the paymentof costs, except that the PAB General Counsel and the GAO were exemptedfrom paying the costs. In response to comments, this provision, now atandSection; 28.58, provides that each party will receive a copy of the transcript.However, a party requesting additional copies of the transcript will haveto pay the costs of the additional copy. Section 28.56 of the proposed rule, which is andSection; 28.61 in the finalrule, discusses burdens of proof. One comment urged that this provisionbe amended to state that the agency's action in a denial of a within-gradeincrease must be supported by substan- tial evidence. The burden of proofin such cases has been established by case law here and in the executivebranch. The Board believes that that issue should continue to be governedby case law rather than by its rulemaking authority. The rules of the Board have always provided a means for non-Board membersto conduct hearings. One comment urged that this entire process be abandoned.The argument was that the process effectively delegated the Board's authorityto non-Board members. Such delegation of authority, the argument continued,is not permitted by the statute that created the Board. Though seldom used, this provision has always been deemed necessary primarilybecause the Board members do serve in a part-time capacity. Therefore,an unusual surge in the case load or other unique circumstances could makecase processing by the five part-time Board members so slow and inefficientas to create an injustice to all the parties. The one time this provisionhas been used to date represents a good example. An extremely complex EEOcase required substantially more time to litigate than originally anticipated.The term of the presiding member expired before a decision could be issued.That individual no longer had the authority to issue a decision. Withoutthis provision, the alternative would have involved assigning a new memberto rehear the case or to render a decision based solely on the writtenrecord. Using this provision, however, the Board appointed the former memberas a hearing officer so that the case could proceed to a decision expeditiously.The provision in the former rule, andSection; 28.25(a), required that a memberor panel of members review the hearing officer's report and the memberor panel of members would then issue a decision. The proposed rule, atandSection; 28.86 (a) and (b), retained the basic means by which a non-Boardmember could hear a case. The proposed rule, however, attempted to furtherrefine the process by which a final Board decision would be produced whena non-Board member originally hears the case. In response to the comment, the Board does not reach the question of whetherit may delegate its statutory decision-making authority, because the purposeand effect of this provision have never been to delegate such authorityto a non-Board member. To avoid any suggestion that decision-making authorityis being delegated by this provision, the paragraphs that address hearingsconducted by non-members are substantially re-written at andSection; 28.86.The section makes it clear that the non-member prepares a ``recommendeddecision'' and that, even if the parties take no exception to the recommendeddecision, the Board will review it with the power to adopt, reverse, remand,modify or vacate the recommended decision, in whole or in part. The sectionalso emphasizes in various ways that the Board's review of the recommendeddecision is virtually unfettered. In short, the provision in no way representsa delegation of the Board's decision-making authority and the Board neednot reach the issue of whether it could delegate any of its decision-makingauthority.Section 28.25(c) of the former rule sets forth five grounds upon whichthe Board could reconsider and reverse an initial decision. The scope ofthe Board's review was the same as that used by federal courts of appealin their review of Board decisions, but the scope of review was not asbroad as the scope of review used by the MSPB when it reviews an initialdecision by one of its administrative judges. The proposed rule at andSection;28.86(e) made no change in the Board's scope of review. A comment suggestedthat the Board should not so limit its scope of review. The comment arguedthat the Board should retain sufficient authority to correct all decisionsthat are in error, whether the error is factual or legal. The Board concursand has rewritten andSection; 28.87 accordingly. The final language allowsthe Board, like the MSPB, to conduct a de novo review of the law and factsfor each initial decision that the Board is called upon to reconsider.The former rule provided at andSection; 28.25(h) that ``any person'' couldseek enforcement of a final decision. The proposed rule offered no changein that provision. One comment argued that the reference to ``any person''was vague and should be changed to read ``petitioner, counsel or an intervenor,subject to the limitation of his/her intervention, should be allowed topetition for enforcement of a final decision.'' After considering thiscomment, the Board decided not to accept the suggested change. The ruleat andSection; 28.3 defines ``person'' as ``an employee or applicant foremployment, a labor organization or the GAO.'' In response to the particularcomment, any person who has no interest in a final decision would haveno standing to petition for enforcement of the decision. However, afterfurther consideration of this enforcement provision, the Board concludesthat it is appropriate for the General Counsel to have independent authorityto seek enforcement of final Board decisions. Therefore, the final ruleat andSection; 28.88(c) provides that ``any person and/or the General Counsel''may petition for enforcement. The former rule provided at andSection; 28.27(c) that the Board could designatethe General Counsel or another qualified individual to represent it inany judicial appeals from its decisions taken in accordance with 31 U.S.C.755. This language suggested that the Board might only have occasion forappearances in proceedings before the court of appeals. However, thereare occasions when the Board may find it necessary to appear in a Federaldistrict court. This could occur, for example, when the Board seeks judicialenforcement of its decision or when a case in district court raises issuesregarding interpretation of a Board rule or of the GAO Personnel Act. Therefore,the new section, which appears at andSection; 28.90(c), is written to includerepresentation in any judicial proceeding that involves a Board decisionor the interpretation of a Board rule or of the GAO Personnel Act. The description of rights to sue on EEO claims in federal court are substantiallyrewritten in the final rule at andSection; 28.100. For the most part, thechanges were made to more clearly state the rights under various civilrights statutes. However, special comment is necessary regarding the provisionin the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (hereinafter, the ADEA). Therights of federal employees and applicants for federal employment to initiatea civil action in federal district court are not clearly stated in theADEA. As a result, there are numerous interpretations available and thereis not as yet clear agreement among the courts of appeal on resolutionof the various issues involved. The controversy arises because the enforcementscheme of the ADEA for employees and applicants in the federal sector isnot clearly defined. While the ADEA prohibition against age discrimination in federal employmentis patterned after the federal sector provisions of Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964, the enforcement scheme bears no resemblance to theTitle VII enforcement scheme. On the other hand, while the ADEA enforcementscheme for the federal sector resembles the ADEA private sector enforcementscheme, it is missing certain important enforcement elements includingguidance on the exhaustion of remedies and the statute of limitations forfiling a civil action. In short, the hybrid nature of the federal sectorADEA statute has caused the courts to fill in the statute's missing enforcementdetails with elements of Title VII or of the private sector ADEA statute.The result is often conflicting and confusing case law on such importantissues as whether one must exhaust administrative remedies, what exhaustionof administrative remedies means, and whether one has 30 days, two yearsor six years in which to file a civil action. The one concept that is generally accepted by all the courts and the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission is that federal employees and applicantsfor employment have two avenues by which they may raise an ADEA claim:(1) Forego administrative complaint processing and file directly in federaldistrict court or (2) file an EEO administrative complaint and postponesuit in court. See, for example, <T3>Purtill </T3>v. <T3>Harris</T3>, 658 F.2d 134, 138 (3rd Cir. 1981), cert. den., 462 U.S.1131 (1983); <T3>Paterson</T3> v.<T3> Weinberger</T3>, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th Cir. 1981); and 29 CFR 1613.211in which EEOC recognizes ``age'' complaints as being covered by the administrativeprocess. However, as suggested above, it is the ramifications of selectingone of these avenues that is not well settled in the case law. For example,the decisions vary as to whether the federal employee or applicant whofiles an ADEA claim in the administrative process must exhaust administrativeremedies before filing in court; whether exhaustion of remedies means waiting180 days or waiting for an agency decision; whether the court action mustbe filed within two years regardless of whether the administrative processis still on-going; and so on. See, for example, <T3>Langford </T3>v. <T3>Army Corps of Engineers</T3>, 839 F.2d 1192 (6th Cir. 1988); <T3>Caraway </T3>v. <T3>The Postmaster General of the United States</T3>, 678 F. Supp. 125(D.Md. 1988); <T3>Marks </T3>v. <T3>Turnage</T3>, 680 F. Supp. 1241 (N.D.Ill. 1988); <T3>Purtill</T3> v. <T3>Harris</T3>, supra; <T3>Castro </T3>v. <T3>U.S.</T3>, 775 F.2d 399 (lst Cir. 1985); <T3>Tkac </T3>v. <T3>Nimmo</T3>, 603 F. Supp. 1182 (W.D. Mich. 1985); and <T3>Paterson </T3>v. <T3>Weinberger</T3>, 644 F.2d 521 (5th Cir. 1981). In view of the split by the courts on these issues, this Board has decidedto adopt a rule that incorporates both the ADEA private sector model andthe Title VII model, depending on whether the claim is first filed in courtor in the administrative process. As an administrative body charged withinterpretation and enforcement of the federal sector anti-discriminationlaws, it is our intention to provide employees and applicants with clearguidance in this difficult and important area and to provide to the courtsour suggestion for a comprehensive interpretation of the enforcement schemefor the federal sector provisions of the ADEA. Following is a descriptionof the effect of this rule. As noted above, it is generally acknowledged that there are two avenuesby which a federal employee or applicant may pursue an ADEA claim: (1)By filing an administrative complaint or (2) by filing a notice of intentto sue in court. Where an employee or applicant elects to use the administrativecomplaints process, we believe that the Title VII enforcement scheme andstatute of limitations should apply. Thus, the employee or applicant mustinitiate a timely EEO complaint with the agency and the employee may pursuethat complaint through the agency process and subsequently file with theGeneral Counsel and then with the Board. Pursuant to our rule, the employeeor applicant, who files in the administrative process, may file in a federaldistrict court at any time after 180 days have elapsed since the formalcomplaint was filed with the agency or after 180 days have elapsed sincethe filing with the General Counsel or within 30 days after the agencyor the Board issues a final decision. On the other hand, where the employeeor applicant elects to file in federal district court directly, we believethe private sector ADEA enforcement scheme and statute of limitations shouldapply. Thus, within 180 days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred,the employee or applicant must file with GAO a notice of intent to sue.The employee or applicant must give no less than 30 days notice to GAOof the intent to sue. Suit must actually be filed in court within two yearsfrom the date of the alleged discriminatory occurrence or, if the discriminationis willful, within three years of the alleged discriminatory occurrence.A variety of policy reasons support the above described approach. The useof different enforcement schemes for Title VII and ADEA cases in the federalsector would lead to splitting complaints that allege violations of bothstatutes or to premature departure from the administrative process in orderto timely file a lawsuit on the ADEA issue. For example, if the requirementto exhaust administrative remedies were different for Title VII (i.e.,may file in court 180 days after formal administrative complaint) and forADEA cases (i.e., may not file in court until agency decision issues),then employees or applicants raising both issues in an administrative complaintwould be forced to forego their right after 180 days to file the TitleVII issue in court or they would be forced to split their case in orderto exercise their right to file the Title VII issue in court. Likewise,the statute of limitations is different under the two statutes. In mostcases, private sector employees or applicants must file ADEA allegationsin court within two years after the alleged discriminatory occurrence.Federal sector employees or applicants under Title VII may wait until 30days after the final administrative decision. The final administrativedecision is often more than 2 years after the alleged discriminatory occurrence.Therefore, federal sector employees or applicants raising a Title VII issueand an ADEA issue together in the administrative complaint process may,after two years in the administrative process, be faced with splittingthe case to take the age issue into court in a timely fashion or with abandoningtheir right to an administrative determination on the Title VII issue inorder to file both issues in court. None of these options is reasonableor palatable. Thus, in cases alleging age discrimination, we adopt theentire Title VII scheme_both the exhaustion of remedies concept and thelimitations period_when the employee or applicant elects to pursue theadministrative complaints process and we adopt the entire private sectorADEA scheme when the employee or applicant elects to bypass the administrativeprocess and go directly to court. Further support for this approach is found in the Civil Service ReformAct and its legislative history. The Reform Act provides a 30 day limitationsperiod for federal employees to file suit when a claim of age discriminationis based on an action that is appealable to the MSPB (i.e., a ``mixed case''involving a claim of age discrimination). See 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(2). Thisappears to indicate that Congress intended or understood that the 30 daylimitations period from Title VII applied as well to ADEA lawsuits. SeeS. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. at 63; reprinted in 1978 U.S. CodeCong. and Admin. News 2723, 2785 (``Under the anti-discrimination lawsan employee has 30 days from the final agency action to initiate a de novocourt proceeding''). Failure to use the 30 day limitations period for allcivil actions under the ADEA would result in some age cases having a 30day limitations period (i.e., mixed case complaints that raise age discrimination)and others having a 2 or 3 year limitations period (i.e., non-mixed caseage complaints). For all of these reasons, we have chosen to adopt the Title VII enforcementscheme for ADEA cases filed in the administrative complaints process andthe private sector ADEA enforcement scheme for cases that initiate in federalcourt. One comment suggested that all or part of the statute of limitations forwillful violations, which is incorporated from the Fair Labor StandardsAct (FLSA) into private sector ADEA provisions, has been held by the courtsto be inapplicable to the Federal Government. We find this argument tobe based upon a misreading of certain court decisions. Specifically thecomment apparently relies on the Supreme Court decision in <T3>Lehman </T3>v. <T3>Nakshian</T3>, 453 U.S. 156, 26 FEP 65 (1981). According to the comment,the <T3>Nakshian </T3>decision holds that none of the private sector ADEA/FLSAenforcement scheme, including the statute of limitations, is incorporatedinto the federal sector ADEA provisions. The <T3>Nakshian </T3>holding is not that broad. The issue in <T3>Nakshian </T3>was whether the ADEA provided a right to jury trial infederal sector age discrimination law suits; in other words, whether Congresshad waived sovereign immunity on this issue. Like the waiver of immunityitself, it is well settled that ``limitations and conditions upon whichthe Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptionsthereto are not to be implied.'' <T3>Lehman </T3>v. <T3>Nakshian</T3>, at pages 160-161. Such waivers of immunity must be ``unequivocallyexpressed.'' <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Mitchell</T3>, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980). The <T3>Nakshian </T3>court held that in the federal sector ADEA provisions,Congress did not ``affirmatively and unambiguously'' waive sovereign immunityand grant a right to a jury trial. Thus, the waiver of sovereign immunitywas limited to a right to sue the government in a nonjury trial. Alongthe way, the <T3>Nakshian </T3>court stated in various ways that Congress did not adoptthe FLSA enforcement scheme into the federal sector ADEA provisions. Itis such statements that have led some courts, as well as one comment onour proposed rule, to conclude that the FLSA enforcement scheme, includingthe statute of limitations, does not apply to the federal sector ADEA provisions.This, however, misses the point of the <T3>Nakshian </T3>ruling. Since the issue was waiver of sovereign immunity,the <T3>Nakshian </T3>court's holding was that in the federal sector ADEA provisionsCongress did not ``affirmatively and unambiguously'' express an intentto waive sovereign immunity regarding jury trials by adopting the FLSAenforcement scheme. The ``affirmative and unambiguous waiver'' standardin the <T3>Nakshian </T3>ruling has no bearing on the question of how certainprocedural gaps in the federal sector ADEA enforcement scheme should befilled in. Frequently in federal civil law, Congress will fail to include proceduraldetails in the enforcement scheme (e.g., identity of the proper party defendant,exhaustion of administrative remedies, statute of limitations). In suchcircumstances, the Supreme Court teaches that the ``task is to `borrow'the most suitable statute or other rule of timeliness from some other source.''<T3>Del Costello </T3>v. <T3>Internat'l Brotherhood of Teamsters</T3>, 462 U.S. 151, 158 (198) and<T3>Wilson </T3>v. <T3>Garcia</T3>, 471 U.S. 261 (1984). Thus, the ruling in <T3>Nakshian </T3>was that Congress had not ``unequivocally expressed''its consent to waive sovereign immunity to jury trials in federal sectorADEA law suits and such consent cannot be ``implied.'' On the other hand,when faced with providing a statute of limitations where Congress did notprovide one, it is proper, even necessary, to ``borrow'' from a similarstatute or ``imply'' that a similar statute provides the most reasonableguidance. Consistent with this approach, many courts, noting that the ADEA does notidentify the proper party defendant in federal sector law suits, have ``borrowed''the relevant provision from Title VII. See <T3>Ellis </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service</T3>, 784 F.2d 835, 838 (7th Cir. 1986); <T3>Romain </T3>v. <T3>Shear</T3>, 799 F.2d 1416, 1418 (9th Cir. 1986); and <T3>Healy </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service</T3>, 677 F. Supp. 1284 (E.D.N.Y. 1987). Likewise,the ADEA does not contain a statute of limitations for Federal sector employeeor applicant cases that are initiated in the administrative process. Thus,numerous courts have ``borrowed'' the relevant provision from Title VII.See <T3>Caraway </T3>v. <T3>Postmaster General of U.S.</T3>, supra, and <T3>Healy </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service</T3>, supra.In deciding that a statute of limitations period of one federal law shouldbe applied to another federal law, which is silent on the time for bringingan action, the courts refer to a law that is most analogous in terms of``Federal policy and practicalities.'' See <T3>Del Costello </T3>v. <T3>Internat'l Brotherhood of Teamsters</T3>, supra, at 171-172. With thisin mind, we chose to adopt the Title VII enforcement scheme and statuteof limitations for ADEA cases filed in the administrative process and wechose to adopt the private sector ADEA enforcement scheme and statute oflimitations for ADEA cases filed first in federal district court. The formerchoice conforms with the decisions in <T3>Caraway </T3>and <T3>Healy</T3>. With regard to the latter choice, we have found no decisionsaddressing the question of what statute of limitations to use when a federalsector ADEA complainant goes first to federal district court. However,using the standards enunciated by the <T3>Del Costello</T3> court, the answer seems obvious. The private sectorADEA statute and the federal sector statute are both intended to prohibitage discrimination and both allow the filing of a civil action after noticeis given to the EEOC. Although, as the Supreme Court noted in <T3>Nakshian</T3>, the substantive protection of the federal sector ADEAstatute is ``patterned after'' the substantive protection of Title VII,the latter statute requires that considerable administrative processingbe completed before suit can be filed in federal district court. Thereis no provision in Title VII for bypassing the administrative process.Therefore, when the employee or applicant with a federal sector ADEA claimelects to bypass the administrative process, the statute of limitationsthat is most analogous in terms of federal policy and practicalities isthe private sector ADEA statute, which incorporates by reference the statuteof limitations from the Fair Labor Standards Act. In the alternative, we could have reached the exact same result by borrowingfrom the Civil Service Reform Act statute of limitations (5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(2)),which is discussed above. It can be argued that it is the most analogouslimitations period since it applies not only to civil rights actions byfederal employees, but more specifically to those alleging age discrimination.It also can be argued that it is at least as analogous as the Title VIIlimitations period to which it is identical. Thus, the Reform Act supportsthe use of a 30 day limitations period for ADEA lawsuits either because,as discussed above, its legislative history indicates that Congress intendedthe Title VII limitations period be applied to ADEA actions or becausethe Reform Act limitations period is the most analogous statute of limitationsor because the limitations periods common to both Title VII and the ReformAct should be borrowed as the most analogous statutes of limitation. Since the GAO Personnel Act, as amended, makes EEO decisions of the Boardappealable to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and since, inanother federal personnel context, the courts have held that the courtof appeals will not hear a case that is also before a federal districtcourt on substantially the same issues (i.e., judicial review of mixedcases), we note in the final rule at andSection; 28.100(e) that a Board decisionon an EEO case could be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the FederalCircuit in lieu of filing in a federal district court. In the past, both in the executive branch and at GAO, an employee or applicantfor employment could file an EEO complaint and 180 days later file in federaldistrict court. Then both the administrative and judicial proceedings wouldmove forward simultaneously. However, in 1987, the EEOC changed the rulefor the executive branch. Under the new rule, filing the lawsuit terminatesthe processing of the administrative complaint. At andSection; 28.101, weadopt this same rule for EEO cases filed with the Board. The former rule provided a process by which the Board may grant a requestfrom the General Counsel to stay a GAO personnel action. However, the formerrule provided no guidance as to whether a stay that the Board granted couldbe vacated during the subsequent litigation. When that issue arose in acase, the Board established the rule that a member, subject to interlocutoryreview by the Board, may vacate the stay of a personnel action when theevidence taken at hearing warrants such action. However, with andSection;28.133 of the proposed rule, the Board changed that rule. There being nocomments in opposition to the provision, the final rule provides that onlythe Board, rather than a member, may vacate a Board imposed stay of a GAOpersonnel action. A comment was received on the stay process in general. In brief, the GeneralCounsel is authorized to ask the Board to stay a personnel action whenthere are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action willresult in a prohibited personnel practice. The comment received on thestay process suggested that the General Counsel also be required to showharm to the affected employee and to show a likelihood of prevailing inthe subsequent litigation. Furthermore, when the case involved EEO allegations,it was suggested that the General Counsel defer any possible stay actionuntil GAO completes its investigation. After careful consideration, theBoard rejected all of these suggestions. The criteria and processes forstay proceedings before this Board are based upon and derived from thestay authority created by Congress for the Special Counsel and the MSPB.However, the changes suggested in the comment would restrict the GeneralCounsel's authority as compared to that of the Special Counsel and wouldprevent the General Counsel from requesting a stay in circumstances inwhich the Special Counsel in the executive branch could successfully seeka stay. This Board is unwilling to modify the stay process in ways thatwould significantly reduce the authority of the General Counsel as a publicprosecutor or that would indirectly diminish the rights of GAO employees.Finally, andSection; 28.155 is a savings provision. It provides that anycase in which the charge was filed before this rule became final will beprocessed under the former rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 4 CFR Parts 27 and 28 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 4 of the Code of FederalRegulations, Parts 27 and 28, are amended as follows. 1.

(b) The scope of the Board's operations encompasses the investigation and,where necessary, adjudication of cases arising under 31 U.S.C. 753. Inaddition, the Board has authority for oversight of the equal employmentopportunity program at GAO. This includes the review of policies and evaluationof operations as they relate to EEO objectives and, where necessary, theordering of corrective action for violation of or inconsistencies withequal employment opportunity laws. (c) The intent of Subchapters III and IV of Chapter 7 of Title 31, U.S.C.is to provide GAO independence in administering its labor and employeerelations function, while ensuring that ``GAO employees are entitled tothe same rights and protection as employees in the executive branch'' H.R.Rep. No. 96-494, p. 15 (1980). (d) In considering any procedural matter not specifically addressed inthese rules, the Board will be guided, but not bound, by the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 28.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Jurisdiction. </ITAG>(a) The Board has jurisdiction to hear and decide the following actionsbrought by the General Counsel: (1) Proceedings in which the General Counsel seeks to stay a personnelaction based upon an alleged prohibited personnel practice that has occurredor is about to occur; (2) Proceedings in which the General Counsel seeks corrective action foran alleged prohibited personnel practice; and (3) Proceedings in which the General Counsel seeks discipline for a GAOemployee who has allegedly committed a prohibited personnel practice orwho has allegedly engaged in prohibited political activity. (b) The Board has jurisdiction to hear any action brought by any personor group of persons in the following subject areas: (1) An officer or employee appeal involving a removal, suspension for morethan 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough of not more than 30days; (2) A prohibited personnel practice under 31 U.S.C. 732(b)(2); (3) A decision of an appropriate unit of employees for collective bargaining;(4) An election or certification of a collective bargaining representative;(5) A matter appealable to the Board under the labor-management relationsprogram under 31 U.S.C. 732(e), including an unfair labor practice under31 U.S.C. 732(e)(1); (6) An action involving discrimination prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 732(f)(1);and (7) An issue about GAO personnel which the Comptroller General by regulationdecides the Board shall resolve.

However, selection of the negotiated grievanceprocedure in no manner prejudices the right of an employee to request theBoard to review the final decision from the negotiated grievance procedurein which prohibited discrimination was at issue.
