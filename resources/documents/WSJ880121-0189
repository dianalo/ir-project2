Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government also plans to deregulate local radio services, allowing the creation of several hundred new local and community commercial radio stations.    Mr. Hurd, whose department has overall responsibility for broadcasting as well as police, immigration and other matters, said a new radio authority would be set up to regulate commercial radio services &quot;with a light touch.&quot;    Mr. Hurd said the aim of the new body would be to protect the consumer rather than direct the broadcaster. He said this would take away the responsibility for commercial radio now held by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which also oversees commercial television.    Under the new plan, Mr. Hurd said the BBC would continue to provide public service broadcasting within the resources available to it. At present, only the BBC provides a national radio service, but it also operates local radio stations around the country in competition with local commercial radio stations. </TEXT></DOC>
