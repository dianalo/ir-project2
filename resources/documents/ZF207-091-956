RAM-page card.andP;  The Zenith also connected to anAmdek Laserdrive 1 for CD-ROMs.andM;In an unstandardized world, Maximum has taken the approach of unique driversoftware.andP;  The APX-4200, with a capacity of 760M or 380M per side, approachesthe performance of the better Winchester drives.andM;Average access time is 28 milliseconds.andP;  Of all the write-once drives listedin the accompanying chart, the Maximum product has the best overallperformance parameters.andM;Documentation was clear and easy to understand, with a 20-minute videotapeavailable to help those who have never hooked up peripherals before.andM;Installation, which had proved challenging with the Zenith test platform,went more smoothly for the WORM drive.andP;  It took only about 15 minutes,including loading the driver software.andM;The drive comes with an interface card, Maxsys driver software and cables.andO;First, room must be made for the driver card.andP;  After the dust plate over theworkstation slot is removed, the I/O address switch is set on the card and itis installed.andP;  Then the drive is connected and the automatic configurationsoftware is run.andM;A novice installer may have to do one bit of digging.andP;  The I/O address switchsettings require knowledge of any other peripherals that are connected.andO;Switches come configured for a base I/O address of 300H; if there are noother peripherals on the system, that setting can be left alone.andM;Selecting a New AddressandM;However, the test setup did have other peripherals -- the 3Com Ethernetboard, the CD-ROM drive and a 10Net Communications fiber-optic network card.andO;Therefore a new address had to be selected.andM;Maximum provided a large selection of potential base addresses, as well as atable of settings, to help set up the card.andP;  If the table had gotten lost,the software disk provided a handy utility called ADDR that would enter adesired address and display the switch settings graphically.andM;Installing an internally mounted drive is not much different.andP;  The internalmount fits snugly in the space normally reserved for a floppy drive.andP;  Allmounting hardware and ribbon cable are supplied.andM;One warning: when installing the internal drive, users should beware ofshorting out the bottom printed circuit board by touching it to the computerchassis.andP;  The recommended procedure is to cut a piece of cardboard the sizeof the drive and place it under the drive as a safety barrier.andM;It is fairly easy to add multiple drives to a single computer, but the baseI/O address for each one must be different.andP;  The Maxsys softwareautomatically assigns the next available drive designator.andM;In the setup described above, there are two floppy drives, A and B.andP;  Inaddition, there is a hard drive with two partitions, C and D, and a 2M RAMdrive, E.andP;  Maxsys assigned F to the WORM drive, and there was no way to alterthat automatic designation.andM;Unlike other WORM operating systems, which are variations on Winchesterdrivers, Maxsys handles all drive functions.andM;On a Winchester or floppy drive, the file allocation table (FAT) anddirectory areas get updated constantly by MS-DOS.andP;  Whenever the user or anapplication program writes to the disk, DOS automatically updates the FAT andthe directory to reflect any change and the locations of any new sectors.andO;DOS then erases the old entry in the FAT or directory and replaces it withthe updated entry.andM;However, that procedure will not work with a WORM, because it cannot beerased.andP;  The only way to solve the no-erase problem is to create a new FATand directory repeatedly.andM;Many WORMs do not use a file allocation table as such, yet the tasksperformed by the FAT and the directory on a Winchester must be duplicated ona WORM to some extent.andM;Wasted SpaceandM;Thus repeated writing of updated file information will take up a significantportion of usable space on the WORM.andP;  A new copy of these files is made everytime there is a write to the optical disk.andM;But the Maxsys system creates neither a FAT nor a directory.andP;  Instead, itattaches the directory and revision information directly to the file.andM;When a new version of a file is written to the optical disk, Maxsys updatesthe directory information on the old file to show it as outdated, and writesthe new file with new-version information.andP;  Special FAT or directory filesare never created, so that space is not wasted.andM;The author experimented with a directory containing roughly 1.3M ofinformation by creating a new directory, copying the files into the newdirectory and deleting the old files.andP;  Extra overhead totaled less than 50Kfor the new directory information added to all the files, plus the versioninformation added to the deleted files.andM;It would be quite easy, given the volume of files possible in several hundredmegabytes of disk space, to use up a large portion of a WORM disk's capacityfor these housekeeping chores.andM;The Maximum drive overcomes this problem by intercepting the interrupt 21Hdevice calls and checking to see whether they are meant for the WORM.andP;  If so,Maxsys processes the calls, placing itself between DOS and the WORM.andM;That makes the WORM look like any other drive to DOS.andP;  Virtually all DOSfunctions such as DIR, COPY, XCOPY and so on are supported transparently.andP;  Ifthe call is intended for some other device, Maxsys returns it to DOS fornormal processing.andP;  The operating system adds about 20K overhead toworkstation memory.andM;Installation of the APX-4200 is automated, but the user can choose to performit manually.andP;  The automatic method shows prompts for each step.andP;  When thecomputer's configuration has been determined, the proper files are installedand the CONFIG.SYS file is updated to load the drivers on booting.andM;In manual installation, a directory is created, the software copied, theCONFIG.SYS file modified and the computer rebooted to load the new drivers.andM;Automatic LoadingandM;There are two drivers: MAXBIOS.SYS and MAXSYS.SYS.andP;  So long as the system isIBM-compatible, the user never knows these drivers have been loaded.andP;  Becausethe driver software emulates a standard drive under DOS, using the WORM isnot much different from using any other drive.andM;Certain standby tests that failed on the Amdek CD-ROM player worked perfectlyandM;on the APX-4200.andP;   One of the first tests wasandM;using an old copy of XTree to read the drive.andP;  Results with the CD-ROM hadbeen unpredictable.andM;The XTree utility displays all the files on a disk in a tree format andenables the user to copy, move and rename from a point-and-shoot directory.andM;In the WORM setup, there were two places where XTree did not functionproperly.andP;  First, the total remaining bytes of storage exceeded the capacityof XTree so it could not display the amount of free storage space left on thedisk.andM;Second, one directory could not be renamed.andP;  XTree said the directory entryalready existed and refused to use the name.andP;  That probably resulted frominability to change the header information on the directory.andP;  XTree had notrouble moving, copying and deleting files.andM;Running an optical drie on a network is a challenge not usually dealt with bydrive manufacturers except through their technical support.andM;Unfortunately, that proved true in the case of Maximum.andM;The documentation made no mention of networked operation.andP;  On central servernetworks, adding optical drives can be tricky or impossible.andP;  A few companiesproduce special software and hardware that allow the drives to be used at theserver, but the process is awkward.andM;The closest a network user is likely to come to using an optical drivedirectly is when both the server and the drive have a SCSI interface.andP;  Thatwas the case with the 3Com server, but not with the Maximum WORM.andM;However, the drive can be used as an additional volume on the workstation.andO;This differs markedly from the Amdek drive, which is inaccessible when theworkstation is networked.andM;Reserved VolumeandM;One minor irritation of operating the optical drive on the LAN was thatwhatever volume the Maximum drive selects for itself at installation must bereserved for it.andM;If that drive is shared as a network drive, there will be pathingdifficulties.andP;  The Maximum drive must be kept turned on so that the computerto which it is attached can boot.andM;Whenever the drive is operating, the computer sees it as the active drive forthat designator -- in the setup described, drive F.andP;  It was necessary tounlink the directories on the network F drive and move their virtual drive'ssharename on the 3Com system elsewhere.andM;However, that was not a real problem.andP;  On the 3Com system, it simply meantthat the AUTOSER.BAT file had to be changed if the offending sharename werelinked on bootup.andP;  On Novell networks, the drive must be remapped.andM;On a peer-to-peer LAN such as 10Net, the problem does not arise.andP;  The WORM isshared like any other workstation drive.andP;  That adds siginificant power to the10Net system wherever large volumes of archived information must be easilyaccesible to network users.andM;Another network test was to determine the optical drive's ability to locatefiles on the server and store them.andP;  Because the network saw the WORM as oneof the workstation's own drives, no difficulty arose.andP;  A complete directorywas backed up from the server using XCOPY.andM;In the opposite direction, information also read smoothly to the server fromthe WORM.andM;Running on NetworkandM;The next test was to run an application from the WORM on the network.andP;  Theapplications selected were WordTech Systems Inc.'s dBXL, a dBase superclone,and WordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect 5.0.andM;In the dBXL test, the data resided on the network while the application wason the WORM.andP;  Except for the need to indicate patsh carefully, no troublearose in running the database application.andM;That indicates potential usefulness where database applications reside on anoptical drive, while the data is distributed among the server, WORM andworkstation.andM;Of course, other users could not share the application on the WORM under suchconditions, but it might be practical for data entry, where individualworkstations use slightly different applications with common data.andM;WordPerfect also ran without difficulty from the WORM, again with pathscarefully designated.andP;  As in the database application, the documents were ona network drive and the application on the WORM.andP;  Reading and writingresponse in both tests seemed indistinguishable from other drives in thenetwork.andM;Some of the differences between the Maximum optical drive and a standardmagnetic drive relate to normal DOS diskhandling commands.andM;Four commands that have not been implemented on the APX-4200 are JOIN, SHARE,SUBST and VERIFY.andM;However, VERIFY is always on when using the Maxsys VCOPY command.andP;  Lack ofsupport for the SHARE command is the reason why the drive will not functionas a server drive in a network.andM;This is a drawback, because there are many valid uses for large blocks ofdata on networks.andM;The system also has several commands that could be considered inappropriatefor optical storage and therefore are not supported.andM;These incompatible commands are CHKDSK, DISKCOM, DISKCOPY, FDISK, FORMAT,LABEL, RECOVER, SELECT, SYS and VOL.andM;The user needs to keep a few things in mind when using any optical drive.andO;Because a WORM cannot be erased and rewritten, it should be used to storeonly finished data -- that is, data that will not change.andM;WORMs are good for archiving and distributing huge amounts of data.andP;  They arenot well-suited for interactive operations that cause data changes.andP;  Using aWORM in the same manner as a Winchester will eat up disk space inefficientlyand greatly reduce capacity.andM;Use DirectoriesandM;Because the WORM drive has very large capacity, it is a good idea to makeliberal use of directories and subdirectories.andP;  Seeking a single file over aspace of nearly 400M will seem slow no matter how fast the average accesstime is.andM;With the files broken up into subdirectories, hierarchical searching goesmuch faster.andP;  The APX-4200 can nest subdirectories up to 20 deep.andM;Although optical disks are not formatted like magnetic disks, they must beprepared, or initialized.andP;  Manufacturers preformat the with servo and sectorheader information, but the user must add volume and file system information.andM;Maximum's initialization program is called Mdisk and takes only a couple ofminutes.andP;  Both sides of the disk need to be initialized prior to use.andM;One of Maxsys' more powerful features is its version control.andP;  There arethree version control utilities: XDIR, CPY and LNK.andP;  Version control keepstrack of updates to the files written, changed and &quot;deleted&quot; on the opticaldisk.andM;XDIR functions like the MS-DOS DIR command, except that it can display allversions of files as well as deleted files and directories.andP;  A variety ofoption switches allow the user to select the class of file to be viewed.andM;CPY lets the user copy files, including previously deleted ones.andP;  Although itmight appear that the deleted file is being resurrected, it in fact is copiedas an active file.andP;  As files are never erased from a WORM drive, all filesare available in all versions and updates with the CPY command.andM;Another method of resurrecting deleted files is with the LNK &quot;undelete&quot;command.andP;  This undeletes a file or promotes an earlier file version to theactive version.andM;Another useful utility is LOCK, which prevents ejection of the disk until theEJECT command is given.andP;  LOCK ON, LOCK OFF and LOCK EJECT may be included inbatch files.andM;The average cost of WORM media now is about $50.andM;A WORM drive's four- or five-figure price tag may seem high unless the costper byte of storage, the ability to interchange disks and the permanence ofwritten data are important.andM;However, lack of standards still constitutes a serious drawback that needsresolution before this innovative mass storage method can come into its own.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
