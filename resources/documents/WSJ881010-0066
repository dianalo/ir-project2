Collaborative hasn't yet reported results for the 1988 fiscal year. For the prior year, the biotechnology concern posted a loss of $1.6 million on revenue of $11.8 million.    Under the contract, Collaborative supplies prourokinase, an experimental drug to dissolve blood clots that cause heart attacks, to Sandoz. The contract will expire Dec. 31 and won't be renewed, Collaborative said. Sandoz plans to continue testing prourokinase, in combination with another blood clot dissolver called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, the company added. However, Sandoz will make prourokinase in its own facility in Basel, Switzerland.    Collaborative said its licensing agreement with Sandoz, under which Sandoz will pay royalties to Collaborative for prourokinase sales, remains in effect.    &quot;We're not happy, but we aren't crushed&quot; by termination of the supply contract, said Orrie Friedman, Collaborative's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We knew the contract wouldn't go on forever and have been helping Sandoz build its own production facility&quot; for prourokinase.    He added, however, that Collaborative expects to cut its work force and already has put in place a hiring freeze because of the contract termination. &quot;But I really don't think (the termination) will impinge on the company's prospects,&quot; Mr. Friedman said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Collaborative's stock closed at $3.625, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
