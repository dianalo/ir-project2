(fourth-generation languages)(Training)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Sayles, Jonathan.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Fourth-generation programming languages such as DMS, Ramis, MarkIV and Focus were developed to make programming and other computeruse readily available to end users.andP;  No longer were programmerstrained in arcane languages such as COBOL, Fortran and PL/1, theonly ones with access to sophisticated data and applications.andP;  Theadvantage of 4GLs include their ease of use, flexibility, freeform approach and the ease with which a user can build data bases,screens and programs and meld them into an application.andP;  They donot work as well, however, when MIS staff try to use them to buildentire production systems and put them on-line quickly.andP;  Theseproducts wind up being inefficient, poorly documented and slow.andO;Training of users in 4GLs, therefore, involves not only thetechnical knowledge but also the appropriate choice of tools,stringent testing procedures and careful design for maximumefficiency.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fourth-Generation LanguagesEnd UsersHistory of ComputingProgram Development Tools.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
