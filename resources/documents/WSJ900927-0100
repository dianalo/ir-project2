Both are true. On Sept. 13, Philip Morrisannounced that it will supply the Soviet Union with more than20 billion cigarettes by the end of 1991. A company newsrelease proudly described it as &quot;the largest single exportorder in the company's history.&quot; RJR Nabisco will send afurther 14 billion. After the first 20 billion cigarettesfrom Philip Morris, the company will continue to supply&quot;significant quantities of cigarettes&quot; between 1992 and 1995,also technical assistance to help modernized Soviet cigarettefactories.   Philip Morris declines to put a value on its share of thedrug deal. Robert Kaplan, a spokesman for the company,refused to name a figure to my colleague Richard McKerrow,though he did volunteer that &quot;it's a very nice deal for us.It firmly establishes us in the Soviet Union and RussianRepublic and gets us into the East European fold in a way wehaven't been before.&quot; The company has been selling inhard-currency and duty-free Russian shops for 20 years butnever before have Marlboros and kindred brands been availableto local citizens. Asked about the ethics of encouragingsmoking in the Soviet Union, Mr. Kaplan said, &quot;We'reanswering a call for help, something we're quite happy to do.We have a position that adults have a right to make decisionsabout the risks of smoking.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. shipments replace a shortfall in domesticallyproduced cigarettes in the Soviet Union, and in the estimate(which he calls conservative) of Dr. John Seffrin, chairmanof the National Board of Directors of the American CancerSociety, the 7,000 Russians who would have been killed by thehome product will now perish from the substitute U.S.imports. More grimly, Dr. Richard Peto, director of OxfordUnversity's Cancer Studies Unit, believes that &quot;after thefull death rates from smoking appear in a country, then, forevery 34 billion cigarettes, about 34,000 will be killed bytheir habit.&quot; Soviet youths find American commodities chicand will no doubt delight in puffing their Marlboros duringthe three-hour wait in line at the Moscow McDonalds. Dr.Seffrin believes that the Morris/R.J. Reynolds sale &quot;couldend up in the addiction of countless millions of children whodon't now smoke.&quot;   The consequences of tobacco addiction in the Soviet Unionare already very bad. Out of a population of about 300million there are 120 million smokers, according to Dr. DavidZaridze, vice director of All Union Cancer Research Center inMoscow, who is attending a conference with Dr. Peto inOxford. Dr. Peto says that &quot;if you look at the pattern ofdeaths, smoking is having a larger impact in the Soviet Unionthan in many other places.&quot; He estimates that roughly 30% ofall deaths in the U.S.S.R. in 1987 of people between ages 35and 59 resulted from tobacco. In Mikhail Gorbachev's agerange -- 55 to 64 -- the male lung-cancer rate in Russia isnow about 25% higher than in the U.S.   Bad though the situation is, Dr. Zaridze says there is&quot;room for things to get worse,&quot; and that sales by U.S.tobacco companies &quot;will not be helpful in fighting smoking inthe Soviet Union. Smoking an American cigarette is still apositive image in the Soviet Union.&quot;   The surge in tobacco-induced deaths in the Soviet Unionwill be mirrored elsewhere in the world. Dr. Peto calculatesthat if current trends continue, the number of thesetobacco-induced deaths world-wide will rise from a rate todayof 2.5 million a year to 10 million a year in the 2020s. Thispast April, a consultative group mustered by the World HealthOrganization and chaired by Dr. Peto reported that of theseprospective 10 million annual deaths, about seven millionwill be in the developing world. This rate of 10 millionestimated for the second quarter of the 21st century means,according to Dr. Peto, that &quot;over 200 million of today'schildren and teenagers will eventually be killed by tobacco.&quot;   Faced with a decline in tobacco addiction in developedcountries (down 9% in the U.S. and 25% in the U.K. between1970 and 1985, according to the British medical journal TheLancet) giant cigarette cartels are targeting the ThirdWorld, using their advertising clout and political muscle tocarve open new markets in such countries as Japan, Taiwan andSouth Korea. In South Korea, smoking rates among teenagegirls quadrupled (1.6% to 8.7%) and among teen-age boysnearly doubled (18% to 30%) after the entry of U.S. brands.   Today the U.S. government is actively persecuting Thailandfor its resistance to foreign cigarette imports, according tothe Bangkok Post, and is preparing a list of Thai productsthat will be embargoed until Thailand opens its market toU.S. cigarettes and, more importantly, permits advertising ofsame. The U.S. Trade Representative has taken the tobaccocompanies' case to GATT.   So here we have the macabre absurdity of the U.S.government on the one hand actively promoting the export of adrug -- tobacco -- certain to cause millions of deaths, whileon the other waging war against another drug peril, puny incomparison.   For a whiff of the double standard, consider two newspaperheadlines: July 19, in the Asheville Citizen Times, &quot;Quayle:Open Up New World Markets for Tobacco&quot;; Aug. 9, in the LosAngeles Times, &quot;Quayle Appeals to Peru for Help in War onDrugs.&quot; The vice president told Peruvians that &quot;ananti-narcotics program is critical. It's a must . . . You arelosing your children . . . just like we are losing ourchildren.&quot; Three weeks earlier, Mr. Quayle was telling NorthCarolinians that while &quot;the American public as a whole issmoking less. . . . We ought to think about the exports&quot; andthat while &quot;we're not going to back away from what publichealth officials say . . . we're not going to deny a countryan export from our country because of that policy.&quot; In April,James Mason, assistant secretary to the Department of Healthand Human Services, called it &quot;unconscionable&quot; for tobaccocompanies to be &quot;peddling their poison abroad.&quot; A monthlater, the White House prevented him from testifying on theHill about the health consequences of U.S. tobacco exports.   Since the Russians invited the cigarette shipments it'sprobably technically imprecise to call these imports chemicalwarfare. But the effects will be the same, and indeed the5,000 Kurds dead in Saddam Hussein's onslaught did not haveto pay for the poisons that slaughtered them and thecatastrophe was brutally finite, rather than continuing tokill people far into the next century, filling hospitals yearafter year with the sick and the dying.   So much for the crusade against drugs. As any cynicalnarcotrafficante would no doubt be happy to point out, allAmerica is actually doing is consolidating its position asthe biggest dealer in addictive and lethal substances on theplanet, waging war on all rivals, whether they take the formof the Thai domestic tobacco industry or the Colombiancocaine cartels.   ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and theAnderson Valley (Calif.)
