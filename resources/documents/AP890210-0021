We must protect the air we breathe. I will send to youshortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act. It willinclude a plan to reduce, by date certain, the emissions which causeacid rain _ because the time for study alone has passed, and thetime for action is now.   We must make use of clean coal. My budget contains full funding,on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement that we madewith Canada. We've made that agreement with Canada and we intend tohonor that agreement.   We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund newacquisitions under the land and water conservation fund.   We must protect our oceans. I support new penalties against thosewho would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans. Theage of the needle on the beaches must end.   In some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold thepromise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation moresecure and less dependent on foreign oil. When those with the mostpromise can be tapped safely, as with much of the Alaska NationalWildlife Refuge, we should proceed. But we must use caution and wemust respect the environment.   So tonight I am calling for the indefinite postponement of threelease sales which have raised troubling questions _ two off thecoast of California, and one which could threaten the Everglades inFlorida. Action on these three lease sales will await theconclusions of a special task force set up to measure the potentialfor environmental damage.   I am directing the attorney general and the administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposalto speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic wastedumpers. I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penaltiesagainst polluters.   In addition to caring for our future, we must care for thosearound us. A decent society shows compassion for the young, theelderly, the vulnerable, and the poor.   Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable _ infants, poormothers, children living in poverty _ and my proposed budgetrecognizes this. I ask for full funding of Medicaid _ an increase ofover $3 billion _ and an expansion of the program to includecoverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line.   I believe we should help working families cope with the burden ofchild care. Our help should be aimed at those who need it most _low-income families with young children. I support a new child caretax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families _without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home.   Now, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: Theoverwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided byrelatives and neighbors, churches and community groups. Families whochoose these options should remain eligible for help. Parents shouldhave choice.   And for those children who are unwanted or abused, or whoseparents are deceased, we should encourage adoption. I propose tore-enact the tax deduction for adoption expenses, and to double itto $3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents wholove them.   We have a moral contract with our senior citizens. In thisbudget, Social Security is fully funded, including a fullcost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
