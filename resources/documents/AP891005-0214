(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In 1990 and again in 1992, the mostsophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vastoceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred byearthquakes and active volcanoes.   That planet is Earth.   The Galileo spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the spaceshuttle Atlantis on Thursday, is ultimately bound for Jupiter. Butits long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its homeplanet before dispatching it to Jupiter.   That makes Galileo the first spacecraft to approach Earth frominterplanetary space.   ``It's showing people what the Earth would look like to anextraterrestrial,'' said Torrence Johnson, project scientist on theGalileo mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earthlike this before. We're going to go in and see what this placelooks like.''   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouseeffect and the Antarctic ozone hole, Galileo will film whatscientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer andwriter Carl Sagan of Cornell University.   In the movie, the Earth will appear as a thin, distant crescent,then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10feet across are visible.   As the spacecraft pulls away from Earth's sunlit side, it willtake a backward-looking shot showing five days of the Earth'srotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the Earth recedes.   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tinyplanet that we're on,'' Sagan said.   Galileo will also, at Sagan's suggestion, use itsstate-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. Andon its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone holeover Antarctica.   ``Galileo has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed tome important to do something about understanding the dangers to theglobal environment,'' Sagan said.   Galileo is returning to Earth only to pick up a boost in speedfrom Earth's gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After itslaunch, Galileo will get a gravity kick by passing around Venus,pick up more speed with the two passes by Earth and then begin itsprimary mission to orbit Jupiter, explore its moons and dispatch aprobe into Jupiter's atmosphere.   ``We wouldn't do anything on the Earth encounters if we thoughtit would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said Fraser P. Fanale ofthe University of Hawaii, who is in charge of Galileo's Earthscience objectives.   Scientists say the $1.4 billion probe's investigation of Jupiterand its moons will be the most scientifically rich thatinterplanetary exploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views ofJupiter and its satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's imageswill be 1,000 times clearer, they say.   In 1995, a smaller probe is to be fired by Galileo intoJupiter's cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of theJovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushedand vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.   Galileo will orbit the planet gathering information ontemperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that producessuch phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-oldstorm larger than Earth.   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in 1982 on adirect course to Jupiter, but it has been delayed repeatedly asCongress and the White House wrangled over NASA financing and asthe space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.   On Sept. 28, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent thelaunch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. Theysaid a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populatedareas, but NASA said its evaluations indicated the risk ofcontamination was very low.   Galileo will do more than observe the Earth as it makes its wayto Jupiter. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instrumentsto observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of thingswe don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said Johnson.``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together apicture of the whole moon from the data we have.''   Galileo will also search for ice in the shaded craters near themoon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution ofthe moon's crust and its interior.   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by Venus, searchingfor cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit atleast one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Marsand Jupiter.   Its observations of the Earth and moon may help resolve a debateabout the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of Louis A. Frank of theUniversity of Iowa.   The theory holds that the Earth's lakes and oceans come fromprecipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding theEarth's atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.   If that's true, Galileo should be able to spot hydrogen cloudsaround the Earth and the moon, the result of the comets' watermolecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor risingfrom the moon as comets collide with its surface.   Galileo will make the most accurate measurements yet of theEarth's mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with theatmosphere.   It may also show whether the Earth is shadowed by a ring ofinterplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists haveproposed.   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We maylearn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable atJupiter,'' said Johnson.   Finally, the Earth observations have what Johnson calls ``thesurprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planetsconsistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even beenimagined. Could a fresh look at Earth do the same?   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things peoplehadn't thought about,'' Johnson said. ``Who knows?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 8</NOTE></DOC>
