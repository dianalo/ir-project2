The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed two weeks ago to cut output about 7%, effective yesterday, in a bid for a fixed price of $18 a barrel. Since then, crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have risen $1.73 a barrel, or about 11%.    &quot;Until traders get a better idea of what OPEC members will do, the market has to give them the benefit of the doubt,&quot; said Richard Marose, senior oil analyst for Geldermann Inc., Chicago.    Crude oil contracts for February delivery at the New York Merc briefly hit $18 before closing at $17.94 a barrel, up 29 cents. It was the highest price for crude oil futures since they closed at $18.83 a barrel Jan. 31, 1986. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also rose.    Spot, or non-contract, oil prices posted solid gains. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, climbed 30 cents to $17.95 a barrel, and the January price of North Sea Brent, a barometer of European oil prices, rose 60 cents to $18.15 a barrel.    Some analysts said the current price level should help OPEC members abide by the output agreement.    &quot;The market has given OPEC enough so that it can go ahead and cut production without losing revenue,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., New York.    But other analysts said many traders were still skeptical. Richard Redoglia, an oil broker for Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York, said that although OPEC has said it will set a price of $18 a barrel for its crude as of Feb. 1, that oil would sell for about $19 a barrel in the U.S., reflecting shipping costs and differences in quality.    U.S. oil prices thus would have to be around $19 a barrel to be on a par with $18 OPEC oil, and Mr. Redoglia said market participants haven't yet shown a willingness to bid U.S. prices up to that level.    Wednesday's oil rally also lifted precious-metal prices, as gold rose above $400 an ounce for the first time since mid-November.    Gold for January delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York soared $14.60 to $404.90 an ounce, the highest closing price for the metal since $408.50 an ounce Nov. 13. Also on the Comex, January silver contracts rose 12 cents an ounce to $5.40. Platinum for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $11.70 to $470.70 an ounce.    Precious metals also got a boost from a falling dollar and from chart-based technical trading.    &quot;We started with some commission-house buying, and then it just gathered steam,&quot; John Norris, chief of precious-metals trading at Citibank in New York, said.    Wednesday's strength led some analysts to predict further gains. For example, Bernard Savaiko, senior precious-metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said he expects gold prices to reach $420 an ounce soon.    In other futures markets Wednesday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices declined in slow holiday trading Wednesday. Pork belly and most hog futures prices also finished down. Continued weakness in wholesale beef prices and slack retail interest put pressure on cattle futures prices, analysts said. Also weighing against prices, they said, were traders' expectations of increased marketing of hogs and cattle in January as the holiday lag ends and more animals are moved to slaughter for tax purposes. But analysts said any downward pressure on prices from an increase in animals next week should be offset by a pick up in retailer interest expected by traders because of low wholesale prices and the end of the holiday season.    COFFEE: Futures prices rose four cents a pound, with one analyst attributing the move to technical factors. Some support developed as prices declined toward $1.30 a pound, the analyst said. Trading was light, and modest demand for contracts tended to accelerate the advance, she said.    ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices resumed their slide after Tuesday's brief recovery. The selling was prompted by continuing forecasts of mild weather in Florida, an analyst said. The sluggish trading pace on the eve of the New Year's weekend also depressed prices, the analyst said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: News of a record trade deficit of $19.22 billion in November and the weakness of the dollar helped most soybean futures prices finish the year higher, analysts said. The soybean market also was strengthened by a lack of farmer selling and higher European prices, they said. That strength spilled over into the wheat pit and most wheat futures closed higher. The corn contract for earliest delivery, in March, remained unchanged from Tuesday's close, and contracts for delivery in later months were lower in a market that continued to be hurt, analysts said, by lackluster exports. </TEXT></DOC>
