Arens met with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft andDefense Secretary Dick Cheney. He also was scheduled to explaindetails of the plan to Secretary of State James A. Baker III laterin the day. On Friday, he meets with Vice President Dan Quayle andmembers of Congress.   The United States has expressed qualified support for the plan.   ``We think that the Shamir plan has some potential,'' Baker saidin an interview Wednesday on Worldnet, the television network ofthe U.S. Information Agency. ``We think the idea of electionscannot be seen as an end in and of themselves, (but) that it wouldbe helpful in moving toward peace,'' he added.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is seeking strongendorsement for the plan, adopted by his cabinet on Sunday, both tosatisfy hardline critics at home and to enlist support for it amongmoderate Arab leaders.   Shamir will travel to England and Spain to campaign for theproposal, which the Palestine Liberation Organization has rejectedbecause it excludes participation by its representatives and wouldbe held under Israeli occupation.   The blueprint calls for elections that would pick Palestinianswho would initially negotiate with Israel over self-rule in thepredominantly Arab West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The five-year autonomy period would be followed by negotiationsto determine who should control the lands which Israel capturedfrom Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.   Shamir won reluctant Israeli parliamentary approval for the planWednesday, but right-wing activists in his own Likud Party andother parties claimed it would pave the way for creation of aPalestinian state.   Arens, speaking in a television interview, said some criticsbelieve Israel should withstand international pressure to advancepeace proposals until it has quelled the violent Palestinianuprising in the territories.   In response to escalating attacks on Israelis and growing publicpressure, the Israeli government this week cracked down onPalestinians from the Gaza Strip, preventing them from traveling towork in Israel and confining them to their homes. More than 480Palestinians have died in the uprising which began 17 months ago.   If the violence is to stop, Arens said, the United States musthelp secure support for the Israeli election plan among Arableaders. ``The United States has a very crucial role to play atthis stage,'' Arens said in the televised interview.   Arens also said that ``the most important thing as far as we'reconcerned is that nothing be done in order to strengthen the imageof the terrorists, of the PLO, because they will try to sabotagethe initiative.''   Israel objects strongly to the contacts launched last yearbetween Washington and the PLO, contending they only serve toderail prospects for peace. Arens is expected to point to the PLO'srejection of the Israeli plan as proof the organization does notwant peace.</TEXT></DOC>
