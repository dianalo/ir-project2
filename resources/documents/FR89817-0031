Kryder, Jr., SeniorStaff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, Room753, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, 301-436-7885.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as the regulations)regulate, among other things, the importation into the United States ofcertain animals, meat, and other animal products. These regulations aredesigned, among other things, to prevent the introduction into the UnitedStates of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, African swine fever, hogcholera, swine vesicular disease, and viscerotropic velogenic Newcastledisease. Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides notice that rinderpest orfoot-and-mouth disease exist in all countries of the world, except thoselisted in andSection; 94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of thesediseases. We are proposing to add Chile to this list. Rinderpest has never existed in Chile, and the last outbreak of foot-and-mouthdisease was eradicated there in August 1987. Since that time, no outbreaksof foot-and-mouth disease have been discovered in Chile by animal healthofficials there. In addition, Chile has adequate controls to prevent theintroduction and spread of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease.We declare a country to be free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth diseaseif there have been no cases of these diseases reported there for the previous1-year period. Based on the information submitted to us by Chile's animalhealth authorities, we have concluded that Chile qualifies for listingin andSection; 94.1(a)(2) of the regulations as a country declared to befree of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Restrictions</ITAG>We also propose to add Chile to the list in andSection; 94.11(a) of countriesfree of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease that are subject to specialrestrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal productsinto the United States. The countries listed in andSection; 94.11(a) aresubject to these special restrictions because they (1) supplement theirnational meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminantsor swine from countries in which rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists;or (2) have a common land border with countries in which rinderpest orfoot-and-mouth disease exists; or (3) import ruminants or swine from countriesin which rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists under conditions lessrestrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States.Chile has a common land border with Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, whichare designated in andSection; 94.1(a)(1) as countries in which rinderpestor foot-and-mouth disease exists. In addition, Chile imports live ruminantsand swine from countries not recognized as free of foot-and-mouth diseaseunder conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importationinto the United States. Further, Chile supplements its national meat supplyby the importation of fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants andswine from countries designated in andSection; 94.1(a)(1) as countries inwhich rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists. Thus, even though wepropose to designate Chile as free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease,the meat and other animal products produced in Chile may be commingledwith the meat and other animal products from a country in which rinderpestor foot-and-mouth disease exists, resulting in an undue risk of introducingrinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease into the United States.Therefore, we are proposing that meat and other animal products of ruminantsand swine, and the ship stores, airplane meals, and baggage containingthese meat or animal products imported into the United States from Chilebe subject to the restrictions specified in andSection; 94.11 of the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Restrictions on Swine, Pork or Pork Products</ITAG>Because Chile is not recognized as being free of hog cholera and swinevesicular disease, swine and pork or pork products offered for importationinto the United States from Chile would continue to be subject to the prohibitionsand restrictions imposed in Part 94 because of those diseases.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.We expect that the amount of cattle, sheep and other ruminants, exceptfor llamas and alpacas, imported from Chile as a result of this proposedrule would be negligible. We also expect that the amount of fresh, chilled,or frozen meats of ruminants imported from Chile as a result of this proposedrule would be negligible.During the previous periods when Chile was recognized as being free offoot-and-mouth disease, no cattle, sheep, or goats, or fresh, chilled,or frozen meats obtained from these animals were imported from Chile. Further,there is little or no demand in the United States for these animals orproducts from Chile. This proposed rule would therefore have little orno impact on the small entities in the United States that deal with theseproducts.There is a demand in the United States for llamas and alpacas. These animalshave attained a great deal of popularity during the last several years.The main impact of this proposed rule would be to increase the number ofllamas and alpacas imported from Chile. This would have an economic impacton those entities in the United States who import these animals for financialgain. Most of these entities are small ones.Currently, llamas and alpacas to be entered into the United States fromChile must undergo an embarkation quarantine prior to entry into the UnitedStates, as well as a 90-day quarantine at the Harry S Truman Animal ImportCenter in Florida. No facility other than the Harry S Truman Animal ImportCenter can be used to import llamas and alpacas into the United Statesfrom Chile. Due to the quarantine costs and the logistical problems associatedwith importations through the Harry S Truman Animal Import Center, thenumber of llamas and alpacas imported has not been sufficient to satisfythe demand for these animals in the United States.If we add Chile to the list of countries declared to be free of rinderpestand foot-and-mouth disease, then llamas and alpacas would be allowed tobe quarantined at any one of USDA's other animal import centers, makingimportations easier.In addition, USDA veterinarians would no longer be required to supervisethe isolation and testing of these animals prior to arrival of the animalsin the United States. These functions would be performed, instead, by Chileanveterinary officials. This change would eliminate the cost of paying USDAfor its supervision services prior to arrival of the animals in the UnitedStates, thus reducing importation costs for importers.These factors would make it possible for importers to import and sell morellamas and alpacas then they have in the past.Thousands of animal importers do business in the United States. We areaware of only 228 who have expressed an interest in importing llamas andalpacas from Chile. Approximately 10 of these are large operations; theremainder are small entities. These entities would benefit economicallyshould our proposed rule go into effect, but these economic benefits wouldbe diffused by several factors.First, the quarantine space available at various import locations in theUnited States would allow only approximately 1,600 llamas and alpacas tobe imported from Chile during the first year following the effective dateof the rule.Second, it is unlikely that this many llamas and alpacas would be importedfrom Chile into the United States, since a number of other countries arealso interested in obtaining these animals. We therefore estimate thatno more than 1,200 llamas and alpacas would be available for export fromChile to the United States in any one year.Third, we expect that most of the llamas and alpacas imported during thefirst several years would be kept by importers for breeding purposes, andnot sold for immediate financial gain.Fourth, we expect that the scarcity and value of these animals in the UnitedStates would diminish steadily as more and more are imported from Chileand other countries.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this proposal contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
