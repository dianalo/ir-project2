Details of the statement issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa began appearing on news wires around 7:55 p.m. EST Wednesday, which was 9:55 a.m. Thursday in Tokyo. By 11 a.m. in Tokyo, the dollar had fallen to 151.90 yen in Japan, down from 154.60 yen in Tokyo Thursday prior to the statement's release and from 153.65 yen in late New York trading yesterday. Two hours later, the dollar had firmed to 152.30 yen, still below its levels before the statement.    The meeting's outcome was &quot;a signal to sell dollars,&quot; said Peter Gloyne, senior trader at First National Bank of Chicago.    A dealer at Daiwa Bank Ltd. in Tokyo added that &quot;Japanese investment trusts and others rushed in to sell dollars.&quot; They &quot;judged that {Mr. Miyazawa} failed to get what he wanted to win&quot; from the conference, he said.    &quot;I don't think there is much substance&quot; to the Baker-Miyazawa reaffirmation of last October's agreement, said Yukuo Takahashi, vice president and chief foreign-exchange trader at Chemical Bank in Tokyo. In the Oct. 31 agreement, Japan lowered its discount rate and announced tax revisions in exchange for an agreement that Washington wouldn't &quot;talk&quot; the dollar down further.    &quot;I don't think the U.S. is serious about stopping the decline&quot; in the dollar's value, Mr. Takahashi said.    In Chicago, William C. Clyde, a trader for Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, said: &quot;It's so mushy, there's nothing solid in it at all. It makes it look like Miyazawa flew all the way over here and got nothing, which makes the dollar look more feeble than if he had stayed home.&quot;    A Bank of Tokyo dealer said market participants who had bought the dollar in the expectation that the Japanese discount rate would be cut were selling the currency Thursday because they believed that Mr. Miyazawa didn't offer a rate cut during the meeting. There had been speculation that the Japanese minister would offer to cut the discount rate if Mr. Baker would pledge in return to take steps to stem the dollar's decline.    Nonetheless, it is still widely expected in Japan that the central bank will cut the discount rate soon, probably by the end of the month. The rate, which the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions, is currently 3%, a record low.    Several dealers said, however, that an interest-rate cut, which might make the yen less attractive by reducing the yields available on investments in that currency, would have little impact on the dollar. They said the dollar's current level already took into account a possible rate cut.    &quot;Everybody is anticipating that a discount rate cut is coming,&quot; said Chemical Bank's Mr. Takahashi.    Despite the dollar's fall Thursday, not everyone in the market was ready to express disappointment about the statement. Shingo Kato, general manager of the international treasury department at Sumitomo Bank, said that &quot;the outlook could change&quot; depending on what details of the meeting emerge over the next few days.    Even before the Baker-Miyazawa announcement, currency traders in the U.S. were saying that they expected nothing significant enough from the meeting to slow the dollar's decline.    &quot;It would take something of real substance to reverse the dollar's downward trend. If it's just a lot of rhetoric, I think dealers will go after selling the dollar again,&quot; Arthur C. Agostini, vice president and chief foreign-exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said prior to the end of the meeting.    With that skepticism in the background, the dollar eased from its intraday highs to end narrowly mixed in New York trading yesterday. It had strengthened early in the day as speculators closed out short, or oversold, positions in the dollar.    In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker repeated his warnings about a too-rapid decline in the dollar. But his remarks didn't have the same impact as in the past, when Mr. Volcker sparked more lasting dollar rallies. &quot;People are wondering whether it matters what Volcker says because he isn't the one controlling the purse strings of the Fed's intervention activity. And he himself is a short-timer,&quot; said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign-exchange manager at European American Bank, New York.    Mr. Volcker's term expires Aug. 1, and there has been speculation that he won't be reappointed.    Mr. Volcker noted that he said several months ago that he believed the dollar was reasonably close to proper competitive levels and said he continued to hold that view. Mr. Volcker added that he and Reagan administration officials are in agreement that there's a limit to how far the dollar should fall.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                           New York    Home Mkt.
