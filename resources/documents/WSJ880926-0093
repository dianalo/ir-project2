Bombardier's aerospace division, Canadair, said the Airbus order is its largest parts contract.    An agreement in principle was reached early last year for Canadair to supply the components to Aerospatiale S.A., of France, a member of the Airbus Industrie consortium. But final approval had been held up because of a dispute between Canada and France over fishing rights off Newfoundland.    Although the dispute remains unresolved, industry analysts said the contract had to be signed soon in order for Aerospatiale to meet delivery dates for aircraft on order.    The contract's value is based on projected sales of 600 of the wide-bodied, long-range jet aircraft over 16 years, with first deliveries of the components scheduled for the last quarter of 1989. Canadair's portion represents about 4% of the total value of the aircraft.    Canadair said it will be the single supplier for several large airframe components. Canadair, formerly a Canadian government-owned concern, is best known for its Challenger executive jet.    Jacques Plenier, Aerospatiale's director, aircraft division, said he expects that sales will eventually reach 1,000 aircraft, and the order may be expanded. Currently, there are 71 confirmed orders and 37 options for the Airbus A-340, and 12 orders and 29 options for the Airbus A-330.    Stephane Solis, a research analyst at Midland Doherty Ltd.'s Montreal office, estimated that the contract would boost Bombardier's annual sales by an average C$75 million. The transportation-manufacturing company reported sales of C$1.46 billion for fiscal 1988, ended Jan. 31.    The Canadian federal and Quebec provincial governments agreed to provide loans totaling C$78.5 million, or about 50% of the one-time engineering costs. </TEXT></DOC>
