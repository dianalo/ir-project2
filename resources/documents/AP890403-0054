ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A witness on Monday quoted the late CIADirector William Casey as saying President Reagan had designatedOliver North to handle the Nicaraguan Contras' military needs inthe event of a congressional ban on official U.S. aid.   Vincent Cannistraro, a defense witness in North's trial, saidCasey made the statement in the spring of 1984 during a meeting atthe CIA attended by CIA official Duane Clarridge; the CIA stationchief in Costa Rica, Joseph Fernandez, and a Contra leader who wasnot identified.   The witness said at the outset of his testimony that he wasknowledgeable about activities of the CIA in support of the Contrasin the two years before the ban on aid went into effect and heintimated, but never said, that he was with the CIA at the time. Hesaid that in September 1984 he went to work for then-NationalSecurity Adviser Robert McFarlane and had an office next door toNorth's.   It had become obvious, Cannistraro said, that in the fiscal yearstarting in October 1984 Congress would cut off funds for theContras.   ``He, Bill Casey, speaking on behalf of the president of theUnited States, wanted to assure the freedom fighters that the U.S.government would find a way'' to support them after the ban tookeffect, Cannistraro testified. ``He said Colonel North would not besubject to those restrictions.''   Casey died in 1987.   North maintained in congressional testimony that he acted in thebelief that the ban applied only to intelligence agencies and notthe National Security Council where he was an aide.   Reagan told the Tower Commission on Jan. 26, 1987 that ``he didnot know that the NSC staff was engaged in helping the Contas.''   Charges against North include allegations that he concealed fromCongress and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III his efforts onbehalf of the Contras.   At a subsequent meeting attended by North and Contra leaderAdolfo Calero, Cannistraro said, ``there was more specificdiscussion that Colonel North would be responsible at the WhiteHouse after October 1984 _ the only one dealing with the Contras onparamilitary support.''   Cannistraro was asked by U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell whohad given authority for that arrangement, and he quoted Casey ashaving said earlier that ``he had discussed this with the presidentof the United States and agreed with the president this is how itshould be handled.''   Earlier Monday, a Texas woman who contributed more than $2million to help the Nicaraguan guerrillas asserted firmly, and attimes indignantly, that North never directly asked for or receivedmoney from her while he was a White House aide.   ``That was a lie,'' Ellen Garwood testified when told of afund-raiser's earlier testimony at North's trial that she may havesigned a $75,000 check in North's office. She said North diddescribe ``desperate'' Contra needs to her, but the fund-raiserdidn't ask for the money until after they had left.   Mrs. Garwood was the second defense witness. She followed formerMarine Corps commandant Paul X. Kelley, who testified that hereluctantly extended North's tour at the National Security Councilthree times after high administration officials persuaded him thatNorth was needed there.   Also Monday, the Supreme Court refused to scuttle North's trialor block the trials of two of his co-defendants, former NationalSecurity Adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim.   The three had sought dismissal of all charges, arguing thatgrand jurors and grand jury witnesses were exposed to the highlypublicized congressional testimony they had given under a limitedgrant of immunity from prosecution.   The justices did not give a reason for rejecting the argument.However, in a separate case last week, the court ruled that federalcriminal defendants who fail to persuade a judge to throw out theirindictments because of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannotappeal before they are convicted.   Mrs. Garwood said she had met North a half dozen times and thathe had briefed her on the Contra fight on Aug. 23, 1985, before shesigned a check.   ``Colonel North showed me a map of Central America. ... He said,`This is a desperate situation for the freedom fighters. I'm notasking you for money. As a member of the government and theNational Security Council, I cannot ask you for money,''' shetestified.   Mrs. Garwood, who lives in Austin, Texas, said she left North'soffice in the White House complex with fund-raiser Carl Channell enroute to a hotel, across a small park.   ``Mr. Channell asked me for money after we left,'' she said.``We were probably a half block away from the hotel. He asked, `Canyou give $75,000 to help the situation?' I wrote a check for thatamount.''   When he testified March 8, Channell was asked whether she signedthe check in North's office.   ``Or very shortly thereafter, an hour at the most,'' Channellsaid. When the question was asked a second time, Channell said, ``Ithink it was right there in that office.''   Mrs. Garwood said her father, then a State Department official,had worked on the Marshall Plan that helped save Greece and Turkeyfrom communism after World War II.   ``I felt if Greece and Turkey were threatened, how much more thepeople of Nicaragua,'' she said.   Mrs. Garwood told of a second contribution, of $32,000, that shemade after a meeting with North and rebel leader Calero at a Dallasairport.   ``While Colonel North was present, did Channell ask for money?''asked defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan.   ``No, he never did. Colonel North wouldn't have allowed it.''   In April 1986, Mrs. Garwood met with Reagan ``after lunch tohave Sanka'' on a trip to Washington which resulted in her giving$2 million to the Contras, largely through donations of stockcertificates.</TEXT></DOC>
