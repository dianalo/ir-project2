The report says the U.S. Department of Energy, which owns theplant, and Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the privatecontractor that runs it, should work harder to eliminate potentialworker health hazards at the facility's Feed Materials ProductionCenter.   The 37-year-old plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati,processes uranium for use in the government's nuclear weapons.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, partof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, issued thepreliminary report last week on the basis of a December inspectionconducted at the request of labor unions at the plant.   Its final report is not due out for three more months, butWestinghouse says it has already responded to the institute'sfindings by making some rule changes at the plant.   The report said plant employees sometimes leave portableair-breathing equipment lying out in areas containing loose andradioactively contaminated dust, which could get into therespirators and ultimately into workers' lungs.   ``Given the fact that many surfaces in the plants where we mademeasurements are radiologically contaminated, it is imperative thatworkers store their respirators in a clean location when not inuse. This practice should prevent inadvertent ingestion ofradiation-contaminated materials,'' wrote the industrial hygienistswho prepared the report.   Many surfaces in the plant are contaminated with radioactivesubstances from the plant's years of service and require cleanup,the federal hygienists said.   They said they found Westinghouse technicians who violatedcompany regulations and created a potential health hazard bysmoking, eating and drinking while handling and countingradiological samples.   ``Surely, such a practice needs to stop immediately,'' theinvestigators wrote.   They also urged improving workplace ventilation in some areas ofthe plant. And they recommended that the Department of Energyimprove its supervision of worker health and safety by assigning ahealth physicist to the plant.   The investigators lauded Westinghouse, however, for improvingworker health and safety since taking over operation of the plantin January 1986 from the previous contractor, National Lead of Ohio.   Westinghouse spokesman Pete Kelley said the report made no majorcriticisms of his company.   Westinghouse has responded to the federal report by banningsmoking, eating and drinking in the radiological sampling area,Kelley said. Leaving respirators in potentially contaminated areasis a violation of Westinghouse policies, he added.   The spokesman also noted that Westinghouse has increased thestaff of health physicists since it took over the plant's operation.</TEXT></DOC>
