A key distinguishing feature of this algorithm is that whenappropriately parallelized, the relaxation factor interval (0,2) is notreduced. In a previously proposed parallel SOR schemes the substantiallyreduced relaxation interval mandated by the coupling terms of the problemoften led to slow convergence. The proposed parallel algorithms are appliedto finding the least 2-norm solution of linear programs. Efficiency ofthe algorithm is in the 50 to 100 percent range as demonstrated by computationalresults on the CRYSTAL token-ring multicomputer and the Sequent Balance21000 multiprocessor.</TEXT></DOC>
