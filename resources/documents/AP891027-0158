Anderson, a journalist who was37 years old when pro-Iranian kidnappers shoved him into a car andsped away, became 42 on Friday _ still in captivity, still with noprospect of freedom.   Staff members of the Associated Press bureau in Beirut, whereAnderson was chief Middle East correspondent, held a sad butresolute birthday party, as they do each year.   Lebanese newspapers published letters to him from family,friends and colleagues. Television stations broadcast a videotapeof his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome, born three months after he waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   The three-minute tape showed Sulome singing ``Happy birthday toDaddy,'' blowing out candles on a birthday cake and reading aletter she wrote telling the father she has never seen that sheloves him.   Likewise in the AP office, staffers sang to their boss, ``HappyBirthday, dear Terry!'' Thirty journalists invited for the occasionjoined in.   The party, complete with a cake and candles, was held inAnderson's office, which his colleagues call ``Terry's room.''   It remains as he left it, as if he might walk in at any time,except for one wall covered with the 14 photographs of Andersonreleased by Islamic Jihad, the group that holds him, and a few ofSulome.   A small color photograph of his elder daughter, Gabriel, playingwith her dog rests on his metal desk. She was 10 when her fatherwas abducted.   The Arabic-language An-Nahar and As-Safir and theFrench-language L'Orient Le Jour published the letters to Andersonin English, in hopes his captors would allow him to read them.Released hostages say Anderson _ the longest-held of the 18 Westernhostages in Lebanon _ has been given occasional access tonewspapers and television.   ``In honor of your birthday on Friday, we will be in Washingtonwith other hostage families to mark another sad year in which youhave been denied your freedom,'' his sister, Peggy Say, wrote tohim.   ``We do our very best for you, Terry, but we come together onanother birthday with feelings of frustration and defeat.   ``We simply don't know what to do anymore. Our ceremony inWashington is called a Mass of Hope, and we will all pray togetherthat a solution will be found soon to end the terrible ordeal.''   She told her younger brother: ``A resolution has been passed bythe House and Senate, making October 27 National Hostage Awarnessday. Church bells will toll all over the United States at noon onthat day, a message of caring and spiritual support.''   Mrs. Say assured Anderson he has not been ``abandoned orforgotten.''   ``Thousands still pray for you every day and your family andfriends continue to work for your freedom,'' she wrote.   The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson said: ``Pleasebelieve that not a day passes when we do not think of you and prayfor you. We realize that a simple wish of happy birthday today ispainfully inadequate.   ``On this day, we and millions of Americans are joining togetherto believe that your next birthday, your 43rd, will be celebratedin the light and the love of your family and friends.   ``As always, our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we wishyou and the others Godspeed home.''   From the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, to which Andersonbelonged in 1979-81, came a 33-foot birthday scroll signed by 59journalists, including former colleagues in Tokyo.   On Thursday, the club's press freedom committee issued astatement saying it had sent a message to President Bush, PresidentHashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and leaders of Lebanon, Syria and thePalestine Liberation Organization requesting greater efforts to gethim released.   ``The international press community in Japan is particularlysaddened and concerned that the nightmare continues daily for ourcolleague, a respected and conscientious journalist,'' the messagesaid.   ``We appeal to you to accelerate and intensify negotiations tofree Terry and other hostages being held in Lebanon.''</TEXT></DOC>
