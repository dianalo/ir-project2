The Bank Board said this was its largest liquidation ever.    The Bank Board said all 36 offices of the thrift will be closed today and will reopen as Riverside on Monday.    FirstSouth had $1.5 billion in deposits in 100,000 accounts. The Bank Board said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will infuse an undisclosed amount of cash, notes and other assets into Riverside.    The Bank Board said it closed FirstSouth because the thrift was insolvent. In late 1982, FirstSouth began heavily soliciting high-cost brokered deposits and jumbo certificates of deposit and its assets grew to $1.8 billion at the end of 1985 from $360 million in June 1982, the Bank Board said.    The Bank Board said most of the funds were invested in speculative land acquisition, development and construction loans, &quot;characterized by reckless and imprudent underwriting practices.&quot;    FirstSouth's lending was concentrated in a group of 13 borrowers who own or control more than half of the thrift's stock, the Bank Board said. The regulators attributed most of FirstSouth's loan losses to loans to major holders who had more than 40% of FirstSouth's portfolio of unsecured, commercial and commercial real estate loans.    Riverside has entered a contract with Dixie Management Corp., New Orleans, to manage day-to-day operations, the Bank Board said. </TEXT></DOC>
