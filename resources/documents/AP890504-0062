Thousands also demonstrated in Shanghai and Nanjing fordemocracy and press freedom while several hundred took to thestreets in Changsha. Three hundred journalists from the state-runpress joined the march in Beijing.   Students plowed into Tiananmen _ China's symbolic seat of power_ throughout the day.   By mid-afternoon, more than 70,000 people, about half of themstudents, packed the 100-acre expanse in a collage of chanting,flag-waving and singing.   Red and white banners calling for freedoms unheard of in Chinasince the Communists came to power 40 years ago flapped in the wind.   Bystanders, lining the streets by the thousands, had applaudedand cheered the demonstrators as they marched along the 10-mileroute to the square.   It was the sixth time in three weeks that students have made thepilgrimage to demand fundamental reforms of China's autocraticpolitical system.   ``If this continues, China has hope,'' said one onlooker.   Thousands of workers ignored government warnings that they wouldbe fired if they attended the march, said one government employee.   ``This is the first time in 40 years such a big movement fordemocracy has occurred. I'll just show up at work tomorrow and seewhat happens,'' he said.   About an hour before the protest ended and students left thesquare, their leaders announced that students' two-week old classboycott would end Friday.   At least 55 schools participated in today's march, includingsmall delegations from more than 10 schools outside Beijingincluding Hong Kong's Chinese University.   In a statement read at the square, student leaders reiteratedtheir demands for a dialogue with the government. They had calledtoday's march after authorities on Wednesday refused to recognizetheir newly formed union and open up a dialogue with democraticallyelected student representatives.   The government has called the student demands ``naive andimpulsive'' and called the students' United Association of BeijingUniversities illegal.   Police today put up far less resistance than during lastThursday's protest, when 150,000 students and supporters marched tothe square in Communist China's biggest demonstration ever.   But outside Beijing Normal University, thousands of studentscame up against a wall of several hundred police and there was muchpushing and shoving during which police grabbed protesters' hairbefore the students broke through.   Students and 1,000 police collided again in front of the BeijingHotel when protesters from colleges in the eastern part of the citymoved toward the square. After several tries, they too plowedthrough police lines.   Students walked hand-in-hand down Beijing's broad boulevards.Some wore red headbands reading, ``Mom, I'm not wrong.''   ``Rise ye who refuse to be slaves,'' a group of studentsbellowed, singing the Chinese national anthem, as they passed theCommunist Party headquarters at Zhongnanhai.   ``Down with bureaucracy,'' others chanted.   The headquarters was the scene of a dramatic stand-off betweenstudents and hundreds of police two weeks ago. Thursday, only fourguards stood at the gates.   By early afternoon, police presence had all but vanished fromTiananmen. A banner reading, ``The world is for all,'' was hungover a huge portrait of Sun Yat-sen, who led China's firstrevolution in 1911. The portrait was erected earlier this week inthe square for annual May Day celebrations.   ``Every country demands democracy,'' said a teacher from theCentral Academy of Industrial Arts. ``Democracy is developing here,too.''   Three hundred journalists from the state press held anunprecedented protest at the official Xinhua News Agency, callingfor a free press. Some said they had been locked inside theiroffices and had to sneak out to take part.   The group later joined the student march, carrying bannerssupporting Qin Benli, the editor of a liberal Shanghai newspaper,the World Economic Herald. Qin was sacked last week after his paperwas critical of the government.   ``Our mouths cannot say what we want them to,'' said one banner.   As the protest ended, student leader Wu'er Kaixi urged studentsto continue their efforts to inform citizens about their movement.   Students gathered contributions from the crowds and gave outpamphlets explaining their movement.   ``We need the support of the people!'' yelled one young man asbystanders stuffed bills into his box. ``Without the people, we cando nothing.''   In Shanghai, about 7,000 students gathered near Communist Partyoffices with banners calling for democracy. Witnesses saidonlookers were kept from the protest. In Nanjing, about 1,000university students marched to the provincial governmentheadquarters, another witness said.   And in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, about 300 studentsmarched in sympathy of the Beijing rally, an American teacher said.   In contrast to last week's march, when students were angered bythe government's opposition to their demands for democracy andfreedom, today's march had an air of defiant celebration.   ``Today is a holiday, and we are here to remember May 4th,''said one student.   On May, 4, 1919, Beijing University students launched a campaignfor science and democracy, showing intellectuals for the first timetheir power to lead the masses and affect policy.</TEXT></DOC>
