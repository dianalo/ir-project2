The official Soviet news agency said prosecutor Alexander Sboyevsummed up his case on Monday and Tuesday and that defense lawyerswill take the floor ``after a short interval.''   Churbanov was first deputy interior minister before Brezhnev diedin 1982. He is accused of accepting more than a million dollars inbribes to protect a criminal network that extended throughout thesouthern republic of Uzbekistan.   The trial of Churbanov and eight other defendants has been thecenterpiece of a recent campaign aginst the Brezhnev era, whose18-year rule in the Soviet Union is portrayed as a time ofcorruption and stagnation.   Churbanov, now 51, married Brezhnev's daughter Galina in 1971 andalmost at once began rising rapidly to the upper echelons of theinterior police force.   ``The state prosecutor regarded the bribe as a maliciousinstrument of corrupted consciousness, which become simply monstrousin the hands of law enforcement bodies,'' Tass said.   ``The defendants held key posts in Soviet law enforcement bodieswhose duty it is to fight against injustice, embezzlement, statedeceit and, of course, bribery in all its forms.''   Churbanov was accused of accepting $1,133,000 in bribes, butSboyev suggested a reduction to $675,000 in the amount of moneyChurbanov allegedly took since it could not be proven that he hadaccepted the rest of the money.   Sbobyev also recommended reducing the sum of bribes allegedlyaccepted by Khaidar Yakhayev, a co-defendant who also faces 15 yearsat hard labor.   The prosecutor recommended sentences for the seven otherco-defendants ranging from six to 13 years in hard labor camps.   He asked that all property of the defendants be confiscated.</TEXT></DOC>
