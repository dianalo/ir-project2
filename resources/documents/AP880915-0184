The melee started when riot police stopped about 600 studentsand dissidents from marching off the campus of A-ju University inSuwon, 25 miles south of Seoul, the Korean news agency Yonhapreported. It said four students were arrested.   Protesters shouted slogans opposing a government ban on whatthey called legal demonstrations when the Olympic Games open inSeoul Saturday.
