Moody's emphasized that recently announced steps, togetherwith the shipment of important new products, &quot;should resultin improved margins near term.&quot; IBM's financial structure issound, it added.   &quot;Important to the evaluation of IBM's credit quality willbe an appraisal of the company's ability to show consistentand predictable performance, given the ongoing turbulentdynamics of the computer industry,&quot; Moody's said.   IBM enjoys a rare top triple-A rating for its senior debt,while convertible subordinated debt is rated double-A-1.   Other ratings under review include senior debt at IBMCredit Corp. and senior debt at IBM International FinanceN.V., a funding arm for IBM World Trade Corp. The reviewdoesn't affect IBM's Prime-1 commercial paper ratings.   Loss of a triple-A bond rating would make borrowingsomewhat more costly, because IBM presumably would pay higherinterest. It also would affect IBM's leasing business, whichcurrently can offer interest rates in financing packages thatare more favorable than its competitors'.   Other ratings concerns recently also have been lookingclosely at IBM. In August, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said ithad changed its official outlook on IBM to &quot;negative&quot; from&quot;stable.&quot; However, Sandamp;P hasn't formally put IBM on itsCreditWatch list for a possible downgrade.   Yesterday afternoon, Sandamp;P affirmed its triple-A rating onIBM, but reiterated that the outlook &quot;remains negative,&quot;reflecting &quot;Sandamp;P's concern over the general deterioration ofthe market environment in the computer industry, coupled withIBM's decline in profitability from the high levels of themid-1980s.&quot;   Sandamp;P added that it expects profitability will improve &quot;as anew generation of high-margin mainframes ship in volumethroughout next year.&quot; Sandamp;P also said IBM's recentrestructuring moves &quot;will allow the company to improve itsrelationship with its customers and its timeliness to marketwith new products, as well as to improve profitability.&quot;   It cautioned, however, that &quot;failure to record progress inrestoring profitability to triple-A levels would result in alower rating.&quot;   Duff andamp; Phelps Credit Rating Co. earlier this yeardowngraded IBM's rating to double A-plus from triple-A.   IBM's shares have been under pressure in recent daysfollowing discussions with analysts on steps it is taking toboost revenue and cut costs.   IBM was quoted at $88.625, up 87.5 cents, in late tradingyesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, after trading below$85 following its recent announcements. Last week, IBM saidit planned to divide its business into increasinglyautonomous pieces, and it previously indicated it will cut20,000 jobs next year. It also forecast that revenue wouldgrow about 6% next year, less than many analysts hadexpected, prompting several to lower their earnings estimatesfor 1992.   In expressing disappointment at Moody's statementyesterday, IBM said: &quot;We made steady progress in improvingour financial results through 1990; our 1991 results havebeen adversely affected by weak world-wide economicconditions, competitive pressures and transitions within ourproduct line.&quot;   IBM said it has taken significant actions that will resultin improved financial performance and provide consistentearnings momentum. &quot;For example, that portion of our revenuethat is less subject to year-to-year fluctuations --software, rentals, financing and services -- has grownsignificantly from 32% of our total revenue in 1985 to 45% ofour revenue through the first nine months of 1991. We believethis adds another layer of financial stability to ourresults.   &quot;IBM continues to maintain a strong balance sheet andprovide sufficient cash flows to cover interest obligationsand dividend payments. We believe that the impact of Moody'saction on our world-wide financing requirements will beminimal. We are confident that our industry remains anattractive investment and of our ability to achieve an 18%return on equity within the next three years or so.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
