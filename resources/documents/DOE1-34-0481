However, in order to maintain comparable noise levels and similarlow contrast resolution capabilities, the dose given to the patient mustbe increased. Several modern high-resolution scanners with acquisitionand display matrices of u to 512 x 512 have been compared. Each systemwas evaluated by setting up standard techniques used clinically. Particularemphasis was given to techniques which required excellent high and lowcontrast resolution capability. The three benchmark techniques evaluatedwere as follows: studies of the sella to evaluate microadenomas of thepituitary; the thorax to look for calcium flecks in lung nodules andthe lumbar spine to evaluate epidural metastases in the spinal canal.</TEXT></DOC>
