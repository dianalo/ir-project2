Rothschild Lays Off 150 WorkersAfter a Loss of $44 Million This Month---By Steve SwartzStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> REARNINGS (ERN)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., jolted by a $44 million loss this month, laid off 150 people and said the market's disastrous plunge has cost it about a quarter of its net worth.    The firm said it lost slightly more than $44 million from risk arbitrage, in which the firm bets its own money on takeover stocks and other speculations. The firm also had some losses making markets in over-the-counter stocks, but some of these losses were offset by profits in other areas of the firm, such as government bond dealing.    L.F. Rothschild, whose own stock has plunged sharply amid speculation that it was in serious financial straits, said its capital is about $80 million above the minimum levels required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, the reported loss is very serious, said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. Mr. Long said the biggest problem caused by the loss is that it calls into question L.F. Rothschild's ability to absorb further losses should the market continue to plunge.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, L.F. Rothschild closed yesterday at $4.625 a share, down $1.75.    The firm isn't connected to a similarly named securities firm, Rothschild Inc.    L.F. Rothschild added that it will stop underwriting municipal bonds and that it would sharply scale back its trading risks, particularly in risk arbitrage. The 150 people to be dismissed represent 7.5% of the firm's 2,000-person work force.    L.F. Rothschild also reported a net loss of $6.3 million in the third quarter. In last year's third quarter, L.F. Rothschild had a loss of $5.4 million. The latest quarter includes an extraordinary charge of $2.3 million for a tax benefit recorded in the first quarter that the company is no longer eligible for because it has slipped into the red for the year.    The quarterly results also include a $2.1 million provision to settle lawsuits stemming from the firm's role as an underwriter of the financially-troubled Washington Public Power Supply System. Revenue increased sharply in the third quarter to $147 million from $74.8 million.    The $44 million loss dropped L.F. Rothschild's equity capital, or net worth, to about $135 million. Total capital, including borrowings, is more than $250 million, the firm said.    Wall Street professionals say L.F. Rothschild is far from alone in recording large risk arbitrage losses, though many firms haven't been willing to quantify their losses. An official at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. said the firm had lost &quot;a lot of money&quot; in risk arbitrage, but the official stressed that the loss didn't impair the firm's capital position.    Another small arbitrage firm, Domestic Arbitrage Group Inc., Pompton Plains, N.J., closed its doors over the weekend because of heavy trading losses, the National Association of Securities Dealers said.    L.F. Rothschild has been undergoing a restructuring since two of its principals, Thomas I. Unterberg, who had been chairman and chief executive officer, and A. Robert Towbin, formerly vice chairman, left the firm in a policy squabble with other senior executives late last year.    Since then, under co-chiefs Robert Schoenthal and Francois Mayer, the firm expanded fixed-income trading, particularly in mortgage-backed securities. L.F. Rothschild also moved into asset management and expanded its retail brokerage operation.    The firm said about 65 of the layoffs would come from municipal finance, trading and sales units. In dropping out of underwriting, the municipal department will concentrate on buying and selling for retail clients, the firm said.    The remaining layoffs were spread throughout the firm, but won't affect 500 retail employees or 500 computer operators and other support personnel. Among those laid off were 12 people in the 50-employee London office, nine -- including some analysts-- in equity research, eight in the mortgage area and seven in corporate finance.    &quot;We have taken steps to protect the firm so we can be resistant toward any further great weakness in the markets,&quot; Mr. Mayer said. </TEXT></DOC>
