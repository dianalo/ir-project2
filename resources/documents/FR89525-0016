The existing ADalso currently offers an optional terminating action, which allows removalof the requirement to operate the third IRS in the attitude mode if thedeficient FMS navigation computers are replaced with specified computers.This action would require accomplishment of the terminating action, whichis now optional, and expand the applicability of the AD to all aircraftwith the specified deficient computers, regardless of the number of IRS'sused. This action is prompted by the potential of error in operation ofthe third IRS in the attitude mode, erroneous replacement of the specifiedFMS computers with deficient FMS computers, and erroneous installationof third IRS in combination with deficient FMS computers. This condition,if not corrected, could result in aircraft navigation outside the assignedairspace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received no later than July 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send comments on the proposal in duplicate to the FederalAviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Transport AirplaneDirectorate, ANM-103, Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 89-NM-44-AD,17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168.

That AD also provided an optional terminating action, which, ifinstalled, allowed the third IRS to be operated in the navigation modeon all flights, including those with an intended crossing of the 180 degreemeridian, if the deficient FMS navigation computers were replaced withother specified navigation computers.That action was prompted by an incident where an operator, whose aircraftwas equipped with certain dual Honeywell, Inc., Sperry FM-800 FMS navigationcomputers and triple IRS's, reported an FMS indicated position jump aftercrossing the 180 degree meridian. Such an FMS position jump, if not corrected,could cause the aircraft to be navigated outside its assigned airspace.AD-89-02-10 was issued to provide an iterim basis upon which airplaneswith the deficient computers could continue to operate. At the time ofthe issuance of that AD, the FAA was concerned with, and still is concernedwith, the aircraft's vulnerability to the navigation position jump as aresult of certain errors. The errors considered likely are: (a) An operationalerror of not selecting the third IRS to the attitude mode for a 180 degreemeridian crossing; (b) after use of the optional terminating action, amaintenance error by replacing specified FMS computers with deficient computers,and not reimposing the required operating limitation; and (c) an installationerror by adding a third IRS to an installation already using deficientcomputers.Honeywell, Inc., has established an FMS navigation computer modificationand reidentification program, which includes computer component changes,retesting and reidentification. The FAA has reviewed this program and foundit to be acceptable in correcting the unsafe condition addressed by thisAD action.Since the position jump remains possible because of likely errors, an ADis proposed which would revise AD 89-02-10 to: (1) Require accomplishmentof the terminating action, which is now optional, and which is applicableto any aircraft with the deficient FMS computers and three IRS's by requiringreplacement of the deficient computers with specified computers; and (2)require replacement of the deficient FMS computers with specified computerson all aircraft, regardless of the number of IRS's used.There are approximately 34 Avian Marcel Dassault Mystere-Falcon 900 seriesairplanes, 1 British Aerospace Model BAe-125-800A series airplane, 27 CanadairModel CL-601 series airplanes, and 59 Gulfstream Model G-IV series airplanesin the worldwide fleet that are or have been equipped with the subjectFMS navigation computers. It is estimated that 20 airplanes of U.S. registrywould be affected by this AD, that it would take approximately 4 manhoursper airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average laborcost would be $40 per manhour. Honeywell has offered to accomplish thesechanges and test procedures without cost to operators. Based on these figures,the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,200.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
