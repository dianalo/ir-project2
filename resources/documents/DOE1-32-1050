The connectionwas achieved through redrilling one well and additional fracturing operations,and progress was made toward developing a detailed understanding of thefractured region through a variety of reservoir interrogation methods.Other accomplishments during the fiscal year included improvement ofthe high-temperature, inflatable, open-hole packer used to isolate sectionsof the uncased wellbore in collaboration with the Baker Corporation andthe design and fabrication of a high-temperature borehole acoustic televiewerin a cooperative program with a research institute in West Germany. Progresswas also made in techniques for the collection and analysis of microseismicdata. Reservoir-engineering activities and geochemical studies, as wellas the more routine support activities, continued in FY85. 18 refs.,15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
