Wall Street investment banks are handing over theircomputerized stock-trading technology to big institutionalinvestors -- making it easier and faster for these clients tobuy and sell shares using program-trading strategies.</LP><TEXT>   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., a leader in high-tech trading, hasoutfitted more than 40 of its institutional clients withsoftware packages and personal computers hooked directly intoits sophisticated stock-trading system.   Bear Stearns Cos., Salomon Brothers Inc. and Jefferies andamp;Co., among others, are also equipping dozens of pensionfunds, mutual funds and money-management firms with advancedprogram-trading systems. &quot;It's sort of like the arms race,&quot;says Nick Davidge of Davidge Data Systems Corp., which buildscomputerized trading systems for Wall Street firms.   The result: Big investors can routinely place orders tobuy or sell, say, $250 million worth of shares of all thecompanies in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, and havethe trades completed electronically. &quot;This is a tremendouslypowerful tool for institutions to trade hundreds ofsecurities simultaneously,&quot; says Sheldon Johnson, a MorganStanley managing director.   Why are brokerage firms easing their grip on theirnormally closely-guarded computer technology? It's becausetheir biggest customers are demanding more control over theirstock trades.   The computer linkups simplify trading baskets of stocks,an investment tactic increasingly common with biginstitutions today. Instead of telephoning their brokers withlists of dozens or hundreds of stocks to buy and sell,traders for these big investors can type lists into personalcomputers provided by the brokerage firms.   Wall Street executives insist that the proliferation ofhigh-tech trading systems won't increase stock-market swings.They say that so far, few institutional investors use thebrokerage trading systems to perform index arbitrage, a morecontroversial form of program trading that has been blamedfor contributing to stock-market volatility.   Institutional money managers like the increased tradingfirepower. &quot;There's no better way to trade 500 stocks,&quot; saysChris A. Hynes, vice president of Boston-based State StreetBank andamp; Trust Co., of the electronic trading systems providedby brokerage firms. &quot;It gives you a lot of control.&quot;   Adds Michael E. Schroer, head of research for RenaissanceInvestment Management Inc. in Cincinnati: &quot;There is noquestion that you will see this kind of equipment in theoffices of many, many investment managers.&quot;   Some of the trading systems provided by Wall Street willcheck a client's lists of stocks for potential problems,flagging those trades that might be tricky to complete at thedesired prices, for example. Sometimes the computers willsuggest dividing the trading program into pieces, calledslices or waves, that can be executed with less price impact.   Then, with the press of a button, the buy and sell ordersenter the trading system of the brokerage firm providing thecomputer hookup and go on to the floor of the New York StockExchange or other markets. Advanced systems allow investorsto keep track of their orders as the trades are executed andtype in instructions to instantly change or cancel orders.Details of completed trades are flashed back to theinvestor's computer screen, often within 30 seconds forroutine trades.   Jefferies soon will introduce an advanced electronicsystem called Quant-Ex that can track an investor's differentstock portfolios and offer buy and sell recommendations, aswell as providing links for electronic execution of trades.&quot;Now you're talking about a complete computer trading roomsitting on your desk without the air-conditioning and raisedfloor,&quot; says Nunzio Tartaglia, head of a Lexington, Mass.,money-management firm who has tested the Quant-Ex system.   The electronic trading systems are well suited for tradinglong lists of stocks as part of indexing and other&quot;quantitative&quot; investing strategies now popular with biginvestors. Indexing involves buying and holding a group ofstocks intended to mimic the movement of a market benchmark,such as the Sandamp;P 500 index. Changes in these benchmarksrequire indexers to periodically buy or sell baskets ofstocks simultaneously.   To keep this business from going elsewhere, Wall Streetfirms specializing in institutional trading are looking totechnology for ways to keep it.   There's nothing new in brokerage firms spending heavily todevelop computer systems for trading and analysis. Butcustomers in the past have had to call their brokers to getaccess to those systems, which added to clients' costs andraised worries about keeping their trading plansconfidential. &quot;Anytime you give a call to a trading desk andlevel with them, you are scared that the news will get outand people will raise their prices,&quot; says Renaissance's Mr.Schroer.   Thus, institutions welcomed moves a few years ago by ahandful of brokerage firms to start equipping them withtrading terminals. These barebones terminals, connected withthe Big Board's SuperDot electronic trading system also usedby small investors, became known as &quot;dumb DOT&quot; systems;clients could only punch in orders to trade one stock at atime, and the systems didn't provide trading analysisinformation.   Many of those terminals remain in use, but Wall Streetfirms now are rushing to provide &quot;smart DOTs&quot;: personalcomputers or workstations loaded with analytical and tradingsoftware.   Another reason for Wall Street to share its tradingtechnology is that big investors have been finding ways tobypass their brokers. One is through so-called crossingnetworks, where institutional buy-and-sell orders are matchedelectronically without the help of brokers or exchange marketmakers. These trades can cost as little as a penny a share,although only a small fraction of orders submitted end upwith a match.   By contrast, the trading links provided by brokerage firmsroute orders to exchange trading floors, where completing atrade is almost a certainty. The brokerage firms chargecommissions of about three cents a share, half the averagefor other institutional trades. &quot;We know we save executioncosts,&quot; says Carl Wilberg, principal investment officer ofthe California Public Employee Retirement System, a user ofMorgan Stanley's systems.   Costs are also less for the Wall Street firms, whichprovide the computers and software, usually for free, inreturn for a promise of trading business. &quot;You have a lotmore volume going through {the brokers}, and they don't haveto pay a lot of traders to handle it,&quot; Mr. Wilberg says.   Some Wall Street traders worry, however, that the newtrading systems put too much information in the hands ofcustomers, reducing the need for the traders themselves. &quot;Thereal issue is whether {the electronic trading systems} willbe allowed to penetrate the block-trading process, wherethere is very little value-added and a lot of excess jobs,&quot;says one high-ranking Wall Street trader.   But even large users of the trading links think that suchsystems have their limits. &quot;There is a lot of {trading}business that it still makes sense to use more traditionalmeans for,&quot; says Mr. Hynes of State Street Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
