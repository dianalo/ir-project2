In a briefing for reporters, Charles E. Yates, the ATandamp;T vice president leading ATandamp;T's new Systems Integration division, said initially ATandamp;T will sell telemarketing, data networking and network management applications. ATandamp;T initially is targeting the financial services, manufacturing and distribution industries, Mr. Yates said. Companies increasingly are installing custom phone and data networks that enable them to do business faster and more productively.    The division, which has 200 to 300 employees, will coordinate with ATandamp;T's computer, large business, network operations and Bell Laboratories units to sell, design and install networks that include custom software, phone and computer equipment from ATandamp;T and other vendors. ATandamp;T also expects to sell consulting, installation and maintenance services, Mr. Yates said.    In forming the division, ATandamp;T is signaling its intent to compete with such firms as Electronic Data Systems, a unit of General Motors Corp., and Computer Sciences Corp. But Mr. Yates said ATandamp;T will work with those firms on joint projects if required.    ATandamp;T's Data Systems division has a continuing relationship with EDS to do systems integration work that tries to use ATandamp;T computers, Mr. Yates said. That relationship will continue to report to ATandamp;T's Data Systems group, he said. ATandamp;T's other main systems integration project, its bid for the government phone network FTS 2000, will remain with ATandamp;T's Federal Systems group.    Mr. Yates wouldn't state his division's revenue goals. He said his group has a number of customers including banks, state governments and retailers.    Mr. Yates also indicated that, if necessary, ATandamp;T would make acquisitions to bolster its systems integration business. Adelie Corp., Cambridge, Mass., a recently purchased mainframe software house that writes telemarketing applications, reports to Mr. Yates. </TEXT></DOC>
