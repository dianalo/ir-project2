The lawsuit, filed in 1978 in a New York federal court, related to a policy established by the insurance company in 1976 and 1977 that lowered the retirement age of its employees below 65. The insurer neither admitted nor denied guilt in the settlement, which was reached with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.    Under terms, the EEOC will distribute Home's lump-sum payment among certain former employees. The company also will begin monthly &quot;enhancement&quot; payments to 160 claimants that include credits for lost pension and Social Security benefits. The EEOC said, &quot;We calculate that eligible claimants will receive a total of $3 million over a period of several years in monthly enhancements.&quot;    Home characterized the settlement as &quot;an equitable resolution to the conflict.&quot; It said the settlement won't affect future earnings, because it had previously established reserves for the settlement. </TEXT></DOC>
