But the radio station sponsoring the event said the show will goon whether the city likes it or not, on private land if need be.And besides, how many undesirables are going to show up at suppertime on a week night? Even if there are free hot dogs?   The City Council in the north-central Iowa town of 230 peoplevoted 4-1 Friday to prohibit radio station KRIT in Fort Dodge,about 20 miles from Woolstock, from holding a two-hour concert atthe park Tuesday night to observe the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.   In 1969, a long list of leading rock groups attracted more than500,000 people to a dairy farm in the Catskills of New York state,actually about 45 miles from Woodstock.   KRIT officials said they were inspired to hold the concertbecause Woolstock is just a letter away from Woodstock, but despitethat similarity they said the town really doesn't have to fear itwill be overrun.   Woolstock officials said they didn't want to take a chance.   ``We're not an anti-social town,'' said Councilman Norval Story,who voted with the majority. ``We like to have these gatherings.But we were kind of concerned about the element that might come in.The drug problem is bad enough as it is.''   Story and Woolstock Mayor Kenneth Spellmeyer said the eventcould have been sponsored at the park if KRIT had given the town alittle time to plan. Instead, they said, town officials learned ofthe event in newspaper accounts last week.   ``I think they're blowing it up a little,'' said KRIT newsdirector Amy Alberts.   ``Look, it's from 6 to 8 p.m., no alcohol will be allowed andit's in a fairly remote area on a Tuesday night, so you're notgoing to have that many people,'' she said.   Instead of Jimi Hendrix or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, themusical talent is Scott Dohrmann of Barnum and Kevin Lind of FortDodge, both guitarists.   ``They're the most wholesome guys in the whole world,'' Ms.Alberts said. ``Sure, there will be music from the '60s and a soundsystem, but there won't even be any drums.''   ``And there can't be all that many people. If anybody has towork the next day, they certainly aren't going to drive too far.It's Tuesday night, after all.'' However, there will be theattraction of free hot dogs and soft drinks, courtesy of KRIT.   Dorhmann does not have a telephone listing and no one answeredthe telephone at Lind's residence.   As for the failure to notify town officials in advance, Ms.Alberts said the radio station didn't know it needed to ask forpermission. Besides, she said, the town didn't have to do anything.   ``It's up to KRIT to do all the planning. It was our event. If afamily were planning a reunion in the Woolstock city park, it's thefamily that puts it together,'' she said.   Ms. Alberts said the radio station is determined to hold theevent regardless of whether it has the blessing of the Woolstockcouncil.   ``This is going to happen no matter what,'' she said. ``Beforethe council met, an area farmer called us and said he suspectedthey would vote it down. He said we could use some of his land.   ``And we got a call from a person in Woolstock who said he had abig lot where we could hold it.''   She said radio officials will visit the proposed sites and makea decision on where to hold the show by Monday morning.</TEXT></DOC>
