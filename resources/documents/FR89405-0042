The Order dismisses with prejudice the administrative proceedingsfiled against the Respondents. Although I agree with the ALJ's recommendation,I do not do so for the reasons stated. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>On June 29, 1988, the Department charged the Respondents with some 10 violationsof the Export Administration Act. On March 24, 1989, a request by the Departmentto withdraw the charging letter was denied by the ALJ. In its request,the Department stated that it did not expect to reissue the charges inthe case. In the March 31, 1989 Order, the ALJ based his recommendation that thecharges be dismissed with prejudice on an inference that the conduct ofthe counsel in the matter had been less than diligent and that the proceedingswere intentionally drawn out by Agency counsel. Based on my review of therecord, I am unable to agree with this characterization of the proceedings.I do, however, believe that as a matter of fairness the charges in thismatter should be dismissed with prejudice. The Department has requestedthat the charges be withdrawn; it has agreed with the ALJ's recommendationto dismiss the charges; and, it has stated an intent not to reissue chargesin this case. Based upon this, I see no justifiable reason why these proceedingsshould be allowed to continue. <ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>Having examined the record, and based on the facts before me in this case,I hereby affirm the ALJ's recommendation to dismiss with prejudice thismatter. This constitutes final agency action on this matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 28, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary For Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Order to Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the matter of Renee Inbar, individually and doing business as,International Processing Systems GmbH, Respondent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In a charging letter dated June 29, 1988 Respondents were accusedof committing some 10 violations of the Export Administration Act. ThroughCounsel an answer was timely filed. Discovery followed, and by mid-November1988, because there had been no response to an Order issued in early October,a schedule for the adjudication was fixed. Based in part upon the representationthat a stipulated record was likely, an extension was granted. On March2, 1989 Agency Counsel filed the exhibits list and summary of witnesses'testimony as called for in the modified scheduling order issued on December19, 1988. Here again the Respondent intention to waive a hearing was expressed.Respondents' Counsel did not make his filing and was held to be in defaultfor such omission. A week later a renewed schedule was announced allowingwritten submissions by both Parties. Respondents' Counsel protested thechange particularly to the written submissions on the record in lieu ofthe hearing. However he has continued to be in default for failure to makethe preliminary filing of exhibits and expected testimony. While the representationof his initial misunderstanding was accepted his continuing failure wasnot excusable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On March 23, 1989 Respondents' then current motions to restructurethe proceedings were denied as was Agency Counsel's request for an extensionto make the filing called for in the Order of March 14, 1989 which setthe schedule for written submissions. Counsel were both advised that afterreceipt of the evidentiary materials, which would have been readily availableif they were prepared for hearing, consideration would be given to establishinga post-submission schedule for final presentations and adjudication.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On March 24, 1989 Agency Counsel filed a ``Request For Leave to WithdrawCharging Letter'' which was denied. Agency Counsel has failed to make thewritten evidentiary submission due on March 24, 1989. The time for AgencyCounsel to submit that ``paper case'' in support of the allegations inthe Charging Letter has passed and the record lacks substantive materialsupon which either a default or on-the-record adjudication may be based.Agency Counsel has therefore failed to prosecute the case. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The conduct of both Counsel in this matter has been less than diligent.They have consumed over 8 months and have apparently done little or nothing.The facts of the case were apparently developed and available in a U.S.District Court proceeding in which Respondents were acquitted. The inferenceto be drawn from the present state of the record is that the Agency hashad no case, but has drawn out the proceeding at substantial expense toall involved, including Respondent and this Tribunal and when called uponto show its hand it has folded. Unfortunately this does not appear to bea singular instance of the Agency attempting to blackjack respondents intosubmission. By refusing to follow the agreed upon Administrative Conferencerules respecting notice and assessment of penalties, an ``in terrorem''atmosphere is created which is well calculated to compel parties to compromisewithout respect to fault. If Agency Counsel had done any homework on thiscase his evidence would have been ready to present. The list in his PreliminaryPositions on Issues and Procedures should have been complete respectingevidence. Unfortunately game playing instead of preparation appears tobe Agency Counsel's mode. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In his Request for Leave to Withdraw the Charging Letter, Agency Counselspecifically reserved the right to recharge these Respondents, despitethe fact that the alleged violations all took place over four and a halfyears ago. It is time to end, not suspend, these proceedings. It is notappropriate to have a Damocles sword over Respondents for some time, atthis late date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The inference to be drawn from the Agency action here is that therewas not substantial justification for this proceeding and the Respondentsare the prevailing parties. From the record before me, it appears thatif the Equal Access to Justice Act applied to these proceedings the Respondentwould be entitled to receive an award of attorney's fees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrative proceedings under the Export Administration Actagainst Renee Inbar, individually and doing business as International ProcessingSystems, GmbH are <T3>DISMISSED </T3>with prejudice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> So Ordered, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Hugh J.
