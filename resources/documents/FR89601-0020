The Commissionanticipates that in fiscal year 1990 it will experience a significant deficitcreated by a trend of traffic growth revenue inadequate to absorb costincreases due to inflation and other factors. The proposed increase isnecessary to comply with the requirements that tolls be set to producerevenues sufficient to cover all costs of maintenance and operation ofthe Panama Canal, including capital for plant replacement, expansion andimprovements. In addition, certain revisions to the rules of measurementof vessels for use of the Panama Canal are also proposed. This advancenotice of proposed rulemaking announces the availability from the Commissionof an analysis showing the basis and justification for the proposed changes,solicits written data, views, or arguments from interested parties, andsets the time and place for the public hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments must be received on or before June 22,1989; a public hearing will be held on July 6, 1989, Washington, DC at9:30 a.m.; requests to present oral testimony or notice of intention topresent, at the hearing, data supplementary to any material already submittedmust be received on or before June 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments and requests to testify or present supplementarydata at the hearing may be mailed to: Michael Rhode, Jr., Assistant tothe Chairman and Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, 2000 L Street NW.,Suite 550, Washington, DC 20036-4996; copies of the Commission's analysisshowing the basis and justification for the proposed changes are availablefrom the Commission (at the above address); or from the Office of FinancialManagement, Panama Canal Commission, Balboa Heights, Republic of Panama(Telephone: 011-507-52-3194); the hearing will be held in The Westin Hotel,Sulgrave Room, 24th andamp; M Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20037.Oral presentations should be limited to 20 minutes.

The rates oftolls for use of the Panama Canal were last increased on March 12, 1983,also by 9.8%. the rates placed in effect at that time have proven adequateto provide, in the aggregate, sufficient revenues to cover all operatingand capital costs of the Canal through 1988, but the Commission has recordedminor deficits in the last two fiscal years.While the deficits have been minor, they point to a trend of traffic growthrevenues inadequate to absorb cost increased due to inflation and otherfactors. Commission projections indicate that this trend will continueand, in fact, worsen despite management efforts to reduce costs and increaseproductivity to the maximum extent possible. This growing imbalance betweeninflation and traffic growth underlies the more serious loss projectedfor this year and the clear need for placing a toll-rate increase in effectin fical year 1990.In addition to the toll rate increase, certain revisions are recommededto the ``Rules of Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal.'' Theseproposed changes are designed to simplify the Commission's measurementprocedures and bring them in line with industry standards. These amendmentswould have a minimal impact on the amount of tolls collected annually.The proposed changes would amend 35 CFR Parts 133 and 135 as follows:(a) Amend andSection; 135.285 to increase the size limitation from 30 to34 inches on manholes serving water ballast spaces.(b) Amend andSection;133.34 to eliminate the requirement that fuel carriednot exceed 125 percent of the engine room for obtaining the ballast rate.(c) Amend andSection;135.352 to eliminate the requirement to separately measurethe portion of engine room space dedicated to propulsion power for purposesof calculating the 125 percent factor above. Section 1604 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 3794,establishes the procedures that the Panama Canal Commission must followin proposing a toll rate increase or changes in the rules for measurementof vessels. Those procedures have been supplemented by regulations in 35CFR Part 70, which in addition, provide interested parties with instructionsfor participating in the process governing changes in the rates of tollsor rules of measurement. The statute and regulations require this advancenotice of proposed rulemaking in order for the Commission to announce theproposed changes and afford interested parties an opportunity to submitwritten data, views or arguments and participate in the public hearingon July 6, 1989. A written analysis is also made available to the publicshowing the basis and justification for the changes. All pertinent data, views or arguments presented in writing, or orallyat the hearing, will be considered, along with other relevant information,before the Commission publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> and forwards a complete record and its finalrecommendation to the President of the United States. In considering theproposal, the President has the authority to approve, disapprove, or modifyany recommendation of the Commission. The final rule, approved and publishedby the President, shall be effective no earlier than 30 days from the dateof publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking does not constitute a ``majorrule'' as defined in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291, dated February17, 1981. Analysis of the proposed toll increase indicates that it willnot (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2)cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions, or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. A review of the environmental effect of the proposed increase in the ratesof tolls and the proposed measurement rule changes concludes that the proposalsare not major Federal actions which will have a significant effect on thequality of the environment of a foreign nation; therefore, pursuant toExecutive Order 12114, dated January 4, 1979, an environmental analysisis not required. Furthermore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act is inapplicable,since this regulation is one relating to ``rates'' or ``practices relating''thereto (5 U.S.C. 601 (2)). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 35 CFR Parts 133 and 135 </ITAG>Panama Canal, Vessels.Accordingly, it is proposed that 35 CFR Parts 133 and 135 be amended toread as follows. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 133_TOLLS FOR USE OF CANAL </ITAG>1.

Spaces that would otherwise qualifyas water ballast except that they are also used for fuel for the vessel'sown use shall be regarded as part of the vessel's fuel space as definedin andSection;135.390 of this part. (b) Tonnage of tanks may be obtained by using liquid capacity times theconversion factor with one-sixth off for frames in case of peak tanks andone-twelfth off in case of wings or deep tanks when they cannot be readilymeasured.6. Section 135.352 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;135.352 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of phrase ``space occupied by engine rooms''. </ITAG>The space occupied by engine rooms is defined as that occupied by the engineroom itself and the boiler room, together with the spaces strictly requiredfor the working of the engines and boilers. In addition to those, includedare the spaces taken up by the shaft trunks in vessels with screw propellers,the spaces which enclose the funnels, and the casings necessary for theadmission of light and air into the engine room to the extent that suchspaces are located below the upper deck (as defined in andSection;andSection;135.61through 135.63 of this part) or below a deck with openings. These are usuallydesignated as tonnage openings, which may be so closed as to permit thecarriage of cargo or stores under the deck or a portion thereof. This definitionalso covers donkey-engine and boiler spaces when the donkey-engine andboiler are situated within the boundary of the main engine room, or ofthe light and air casing above it and when they are used in connectionwith the main machinery for propelling the vessel. When the shafts of screwpropellers pass through open spaces not enclosed within tunnels, the spacesallowed in lieu of tunnels must be of reasonable dimensions suitable forthe vessel in question. When a portion of the space within the boundaryof the engine or boiler room is occupied by a tank or tanks for the storageof fresh water, lubricating oil, or fuel, including settling tanks, thespace considered to be within the engine room shall be reduced by the spacetaken up by such tanks. Installations not strictly required for workingof the engines or boilers but that would otherwise qualify as a deductionunder andSection;andSection;135.271 through 135.285 of this part may be leftin and included in the engine room measurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 23, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael Rhode, Jr., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant to the Chairman and Secretary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-12620 Filed 5-31-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3640-04-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
