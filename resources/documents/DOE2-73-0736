The social needs of a typical village, theenergy requirements associated, the availability of local energy sourcesand the techno-economic viability of different systems are considered.The required energy to be supplied is about 1.5 and 2.5% of the nationaltotal estimated for electrical and thermal uses, respectively. Even thoughthe proposed alternative systems are techno-economical viable, a strongdevelopment program could only satisfy 7 to 10% of the electrical demandand 14 to 20% of the heat demand.</TEXT></DOC>
