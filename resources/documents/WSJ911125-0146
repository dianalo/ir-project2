Both sides generally agree that the subsidies should betrimmed by 30% to 35% over five years. But they are still atloggerheads over what should be the years for which thesecuts will be based and, in the case of export subsidies,whether the cuts should apply to budgetary allocations or toexport tonnages. How such details are resolved could mean adifference of as much as four million tons in the amount ofgrain that the EC can unload on the world market by 1997,U.S. negotiators say.</LP><TEXT>   The Bush administration is still hoping for a breakthroughby Dec. 20 in this current round of talks under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, but it already is cautioningvarious U.S. industries that the gains may be more modestthan had been anticipated. &quot;We cannot expect absoluteperfection in multilateral negotiations where you have tohave broad support,&quot; a senior U.S. trade official said.   The EC Commission also continues to believe an accord ispossible by the end of the year, although a spokesman saidFriday that negotiators had encountered &quot;real difficulties&quot;last week. EC officials said the U.S. still is asking thecommunity to make greater concessions on agriculture than thestrong European farm lobby will be willing to accept.   Commission trade officials are hemmed in by a fairly rigidnegotiating mandate, and hard-line EC countries such asFrance believe that Brussels already has gone too far inaccommodating the U.S. For the EC to make furtherconcessions, there might have to be a political push from thehighest level, similar to Mr. Bush's intervention on Nov. 9.This could mean a special summit of EC leaders devoted toGATT sometime next month, or at the very least a discussionof the issue at the Dec. 9-10 summit on political andeconomic union in Maastricht, the Netherlands.   The serious nature of the situation was highlighted by thedecision to call a meeting Saturday of the EC commissionerswith main responsibility for the GATT talks. Officials saidthe commissioners had expressed concern about the pace of theGeneva negotiations but gave no other details.   The current GATT talks, the most ambitious everundertaken, are intended to bring the agricultural andservices trade under global rules for the first time, expandtrade in other fields, and save governments billions ofdollars in subsidies.   GATT in recent weeks has come closer to an accord tostrengthen the protection of patents, copyrights and otherintellectual property. But while the U.S. has smoothed theway for India, Brazil and other developing nations to acceptthe pact, it's still embroiled with the EC in a parochialdispute over whether European wine-producing regions such asChampagne and Burgundy have the exclusive right to the use oftheir names in wine labeling. The U.S. said it won't agree toany GATT rule that would force California wine makers to giveup the use of such names.   In his Nov. 9 meeting with EC leaders in The Hague, Mr.Bush gave the stalled GATT talks a much-needed lift bylowering the overall U.S. goals on farm subsidies. But lastweek's bilateral talks in Geneva broke down over certainthorny details, including those involving base years andexport tonnage. The U.S. wants to start counting the cutsfrom 1986-88, which would give it credit for variousreductions in farm supports instituted by the 1985 U.S. farmbill. However, the EC prefers a base period closer to 1988-91to protect a jump in its subsidies that started in 1986.   The U.S., moreover, wants the proposed cuts in exportsubsidies to apply mainly to export volumes rather than tobudget allocations alone. U.S. negotiators worry that anabrupt fall in world grain prices could negate any suchbudgetary cuts and leave the world market with a hugeoverhang of subsidized grain.   The EC, however, wants to focus on budget allocationsbecause it plans to slash domestic price supports as part ofits overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy. EC officialsargue that a deal on export volumes wouldn't give thecommunity credit for the price reductions, which are expectedto translate into lower export credits. &quot;The U.S. wants tosee us cut back substantially on world markets,&quot; an ECofficial said.   The U.S. and EC did generally agree to replace existingagricultural import quotas with a system of tariffprotection, but they continue to bicker over how thesetariffs are to be scaled down after domestic markets areopened. For the U.S., the worry is how to sell the system tosugar growers, peanut farmers, dairy producers and othercommodity groups that have been under import protection foryears.   The U.S. also remains deadlocked with the EC over certainprovisions of a proposed GATT agreement on the servicestrade. The EC wants freer access to the U.S.telecommunications market, but the U.S. won't allow thatuntil certain European countries dismantle their owntelecommunications monopolies and open their markets to U.S.vendors.   The U.S. and the EC are together in insisting that anyservices agreement should allow GATT members to bar or limitthe entry of financial-service companies from countries thatfail to open up their own markets. But developing countriessuch as South Korea, India, Thailand and Singapore and somefrom Latin America are resisting that proposition.   Olin Wethington, assistant Treasury secretary forinternational affairs, warned that the U.S. won't &quot;accept anyagreement that gives other countries a free ride into ourmarket.&quot;   The Japanese are somewhere in the middle of this dispute.They have proposed language that would allow the U.S. to denya country all the benefits of a servicestrade treaty if itkeeps out U.S. financial institutions. But that penalty wouldbe so harsh that the U.S. probably would never invoke it. TheU.S., instead, wants an approach that would limit anyretaliation for unwarranted barriers in thefinancial-services industry to that industry alone, and notto have the dispute affect other industrial sectors.   ---   David Wessel contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
