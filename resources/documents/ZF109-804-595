 In this case, plenty.andP;  The Progress relational databasemanagement system (RDBMS) and fourth generation language (4GL) from ProgressSoftware Corp. based in Bedford, Mass., has many of the buzzword attributesthat are becoming synonymous with progressive development tools in the '90s.andM;Progress comes with portability across different hardware and operatingsystem platforms, support for several network protocols and windowinginterfaces, a client-server network architecture, and the ability toconcurrently access multiple databases (even those created by other RDBMSs).andO;It also comes with end-user computing and prototyping tools, ANSI-SQL and astructured 4GL.andP;  That's quite a list.andM;Progress is a powerful tool for developing applications.andP;  It supports verylarge databases (even in excess of 5 billion bytes); and its securityfeatures are good.andP;  Progress features referential integrity to preventaccidental deletion of files and records and an automatic crash recovery incase of a system or hardware failure.andP;  (I actually simulated a crash, andwhen I restarted Progress discovered that all my incomplete transactions hadbeen backed-out.)andM;Database administrators will be happy to know that backups can be performedduring the day while the database is available for processing.andM;The heart of the system is as it should be: a comprehensive and easy-to-usedata dictionary.andP;  The data dictionary contains validation rules for fieldvalues, prompting messages for the person entering data in the database andplenty of default attribute values to speed up the defining process.andM;I found defining a database and writing a program in the Progress 4GL tomaintain it fairly painless.andP;  The ability to code ANSI-SQL along withProgress' 4GL statements (even in the same procedure) made the programmingexercise even smoother.andP;  An experienced programmer should not have muchtrouble programming a Progress application after spending a few days with thelanguage tutorial that Progress supplies with the complete system.andM;I liked the optional query and report generating facility, called Fast Track.andO;This component could let me quickly prototype an application with a client.andO;For example, I could design a report for a database extract and run it toshow the user what the output would look like.andP;  Then I could revise thereport specifications and resultant output on the spot to the user'ssatisfaction.andM;After I had completed my Progress application, I could hand it over to theclient with Fast Track to allow him or her to elaborate on it by creatingadditional reports and queries.andM;There are a number of different Progress configurations that you canpurchase.andP;  These configurations include a complete Application DevelopmentSystem for programmers, a Query/Report version for end-users, and a Run-timeversion for turnkey installations.andM;The documentation is very clear and attractively laid out.andP;  The completeApplication Development system comes with 11 soft-covered manuals thatcontain tutorials and reference materials.andP;  The Query/Report version would besuitable for an end-user and comes with a Fast Track tutorial and user'sguide.andM;A single application developed under Progress can run on differentminicomputer, microcomputer and workstation platforms including Vax/VMS, Unixand PC-DOS.andP;  The application would only need to be re-compiled andlink-edited on the appropriate machine.andM;There are several products like Progress on the market aimed at organizationsthat want to integrate the computer usage of departments with disparatesoftware and hardware.andP;  These products are also aimed at value-addedresellers (VARs) and small to medium-sized organizations which need todevelop applications that will easily adapt to changes in requirements and inthe available technology.andM;Progress' major competitor is the widely-advertised Oracle RDBMS.andP;  Oraclecalls itself the largest database company in the world.andP;  Perhaps inrecognition of this, Progress' latest release (version 6), includes gatewaysto allow users to access relational databases developed by other RDBMSsincluding Oracle.andM;One major drawback of Progress for larger organizations, however, is thatthey cannot use Progress to integrate mainframe systems with local ones.andO;Unlike Oracle, Progress will not run on a mainframe; and according toProgress, there are no plans to allow for that degree of portability.andM;An advantage that Progress has over Oracle, however, is the Progress 4GL.andO;Progress users can develop an entire application in the Progress 4GL withoutresorting to lower-level languages such as PL/I or C.andP;  Some Oracle users maywish to exploit this advantage by purchasing Progress as a companion productto Oracle.andM;Progress does not work with Microsoft Windows 3.0.andP;  It supports only X-basedwindow managers like Motif, OpenLook, and Presentation Manager.andM;Progress could be attractive for the small- or medium-sized organization thatwants a powerful and tremendously flexible DBMS.andP;  Larger installations may beinterested in using its 4GL and gateways to other RDBMSs.andM;Progress is priced according to the platform that it is to be installed on,and the facilities included.andP;  For example, the complete ApplicationDevelopment System including the Progress 4GL/RDBMS and Fast Track rangesfrom $1,800 for a single user PC DOS installation to $228,000 forinstallation on a Vax 6000.andM;Bev Biderman is co-ordinator of development services for Admissions/AwardsData Service at the University of Toronto.andP;
