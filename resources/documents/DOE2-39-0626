For a system of N spins, we show thatthe time for two configurations to meet increases like log N when thetwo configurations belong to the same valley and exponentially with Nwhen the two configurations belong to different valleys. The slope ofthis exponential growth gives a measure of the barrier height.</TEXT></DOC>
