In a straight party-line vote of 9-7, the panel rejected President Reagan's nomination of Dorothy Strunk, a former House Labor Committee staff member, to be assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health.    The post of assistant secretary, which has been vacant since the end of last year, is the top job at the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. The agency has been under considerable fire from critics who say it has failed to carry out its mine-safety enforcement responsibilities.    After the vote, Labor Secretary William Brock said he'll seek &quot;another qualified individual&quot; to head the agency. He said committee Democrats &quot;put partisan politics ahead of the best interests&quot; of the agency and of miners by rebuffing Ms. Strunk, whom he called an &quot;exceptionally qualified woman&quot; for the job.    The nomination of Ms. Strunk, 39 years old, was opposed by the United Mine Workers union and by Senate Labor Committee Democrats, led by Chairman Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.). Opponents said she isn't qualified to head the agency.    Mr. Brock, who lobbied hard for the Strunk nomination, yesterday sent Sen. Kennedy a letter threatening to pull Alan McMillan, a longtime department official and well-regarded acting assistant secretary for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, from the agency if Ms. Strunk weren't confirmed by the Senate. Mr. McMillan has been running the agency since David Zegeer resigned.    Mr. McMillan would be Ms. Strunk's deputy if she became chief, Mr. Brock said, but otherwise he'd be needed elsewhere. Mr. Brock also said a new assistant secretary should have the right to pick a deputy.    Ms. Strunk, a coal miner's daughter, has been a House Labor Committee clerk, House Ways and Means Committee office manager, and a senior staff member for the labor panel. </TEXT></DOC>
