Lance Wilson, Pierce's one-time executive assistant, told a Housesubcommittee Friday that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment rightsbecause the conduct of panel members convinced him he would notreceive a fair hearing.   Wilson said attacks last month by several panel members after hefailed to appear as scheduled ``made it clear that the subcommitteemembers have prejudged me and have no intention of affording me afair and evenhanded hearing.''   Wilson's lawyer, Raymond Banoun, lashed out at subcommitteeChairman Thomas Lantos, other panel members and its staff, saying ina separate letter that all had made knowingly inaccurate statementsabout Wilson during televised hearings, which Banoun called a``charade.''   Attempts to reach Lantos, D-Calif., and subcommittee stafferswere unsuccessful.   There was no answer at the subcommittee office when the Wilsonand Banoun letters were obtained late Friday. Lantos' home office inSan Mateo, Calif., said the Democratic congressman was on vacationand unavailable for comment.   Wilson was Pierce's top aide for several years and after leavingthe agency invested in several projects that received lucrativesubsidies from HUD. His successor as Pierce's executive assistant,Deborah Gore Dean, appeared before Congress in May but refused toanswer questions, also asserting her Fifth Amendment rights.   The subcommittee, in recess until after Labor Day, has beeninvestigating influence-peddling, mismanagement and fraud at HUDduring the Reagan administration.   Testimony and other evidence indicates that former HUD officialsand prominent Republicans received special treatment from the agencythat helped them reap millions of dollars in government financingand subsidies.   The hearings and other sources of information also have shownthat HUD's internal controls were so poor that millions of dollarscannot be accounted for and that the total of Reagan-era fraud mightsurpass $2 billion.   Wilson, a senior vice president at Paine Webber, had beenscheduled to appear before the subcommittee July 28 but asked for acontinuance because Banoun had to undergo emergency surgery threedays before.   Lantos refused to grant a continuance and ordered Wilson toappear without counsel or with another attorney. Wilson refused, butLantos nonetheless called him to the witness table at the hearing,then launched into a lengthy attack on him when he failed to appear.   Lantos said Wilson had ``joined a lucrative fraternity of formerHUD employees'' that had ``cashed in so spectacularly on moderaterehabilitation programs.''   Other panel members joined in criticizing Wilson, and thecommittee later issued subpoenas requiring Wilson to produce myriadrecords of his HUD-related dealings by Friday.   Banoun, in the letter to Lantos, said the chairman and thesubcommittee members and staffers had ignored Wilson's right tocounsel and instead grandstanded for the television audience.   ``You went through the charade of calling Mr. Wilson to thewitness table in front of live television cameras knowing all alongthat he had courteously informed you that he would not appear,''Banoun said in the letter.   ``The conduct of certain members of the subcommittee and of itsstaff in dealing with Mr. Wilson ... have made it abundantly clearthat they have adversely prejudged Mr. Wilson and have no intentionother than to publicly vilify him in order to achieve their ownpersonal motivation,'' the letter said.   ``This fact is further buttressed by the vindictive subpoenasissued to Mr. Wilson.''   Banoun said the subpoenas included demands for numerous documentsthe subcommittee has access to and a demand that he appear beforethe panel Sept. 27 _ an appearance that would be a month later thanWilson sought when he asked for the continuance.   ``This raises a question as to the urgency which prompted thedenial of his initial request for a short continuance,'' Banoun'sletter said.</TEXT></DOC>
