Varig airlines President Helio Smidt did not rule out thepossibility of pilot error.   ``I would be very happy if human failure could be ruled out,'' hetold reporters Thursday. ``But we do not want to jump toconclusions.''   The pilot, Cesar Garces, 32, did not speak with the press afterarriving in Brasilia on Wednesday.   Sixteen survivors of the Sunday night crash left the hospital onThursday. Of the 35 survivors treated at the Brasilia Base hospital,21 now have been released and two remain in the intensive care unit,a doctor said.   Reports conflicted on the number of dead. Air force officialsreported 10 dead. A Varig spokesman listed 11 deaths.   The Boeing 737-200 vanished Sunday night on the last leg of aflight between Sao Paulo and Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon River.   After six scheduled stops, the plane took off from Maraba at 5:25p.m. for what was supposed to be a 41-minute flight to Belem.   But the plane strayed far off course, circled above densetropical jungle for three hours, then crash-landed near Sao Jose doXingu, in north-central Mato Grosso state, with just 15 minutes offuel left, authorities said.   Brazilian investigators reached the crash site on Wednesday andbegan a search for the plane's flight registers, which log flightpatterns, pilot conversations and other data.   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sent five expertswho arrived Thursday in Brasilia, the capital, and later left forthe crash site. Americans involved in the investigation include anadviser from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and threeexperts from the Seattle-based Boeing Co.   The local press reported Thursday that a malfunction in theplane's navigational system was possible, but experts reportedlysaid the pilot could have used a magnetic compass in the instrumentpanel.   Surivivor Epaminondas de Sousa Chaves, 36, said Wednesday thatsoon after takeoff from Maraba, the pilot ``began heading southeastinstead of north.''   ``Thirty minutes later the pilot told us to prepare for thelanding, but I know the area well and I thought it was strange tosee that we were flying above a river with waterfalls and smallislands,'' said Chaves.   At least three other survivors interviewed by The AssociatedPress agreed with Chaves' account.   Two other survivors, Rita de Cassia and Elza Gasparim, said theplane at one point descended as if it were going to land, thenpulled up sharply after dark forest cover was sighted below.   Chaves said the pilot announced over the intercom, ``Pray to Godand pray that we will find a place to land. There are only 15minutes of fuel left.''   The plane's belly clipped the top of the 100-foot-high trees, theaircraft ``seemed to bounce,'' then smashed through the forestcover, ripping off both wings but leaving the fuselage nearlyintact, he said.   The plane ripped a hole 300 feet by 120 feet in the jungle, butdid not explode, Chaves said.</TEXT></DOC>
