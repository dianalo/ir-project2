Mindful of the water's treachery that killed 33 of itsneighbors, the city relocated three miles inland behind aprotective hump of hills. Its fishing fleet destroyed, its civicconsciousness turned inland to the road to Anchorage and thepromise that the trans-Alaska oil pipeline would pump new life intothe community.   A half-dozen inlets and mountain ridges to the east, the city ofCordova suffered far less. The quake did milder damage, shakingdown the Million Dollar Bridge, a railroad trestle being convertedto carry highway traffic.   The loss ended attempts to link the fishing village to the land.That was just fine for many Cordova residents who believe theircollective soul is tied to the blue waters of Orca Inlet and therich herring and salmon schools in Prince William Sound.   Twenty-five Good Fridays later the Exxon Valdez ran aground andripped its hull on Bligh Reef, a hardluck spot close to theepicenter of the 1964 earthquake.   The resulting spill of 10.1 million gallons of oil has had avery different impact on the two cities.   Valdez has been the focus of world concern about the oil spill,receiving full-page newspaper apologies from Exxon. It's become aboom town, its hotels and restaurants crowded with oil people,military and media. Exxon has rented an office building and will bea presence for the years the cleanup will take, pumping money intothe local economy.   ``This means millions for us,'' said Jan Buccini, a Valdezcabbie who says his payday is triple that of pre-spill days. ``Thistown is going to grow.''   But Cordova, which fought against the trans-Alaska pipeline andthe tankers it brought to Prince William Sound, is in shock. Ananticipated $12 million herring harvest has been canceled andfavorite fishing grounds are cesspools. Cordova got no officialapology and little money from Exxon.   ``We're devastated,'' said Linden Colour O'Toole, who hashandled an emergency hotline since the oil spill. ``People arescared and hurt. They're afraid the world has forgotten about us.''   In normal times, Cordova would be a busy place. Its 1,200-boatmarina would be crowded with gill netters, seiners and supportships. The canneries would be going and the half dozen bars onFirst Street would be bustling. There'd be money in everyone'spocket after the long winter's hibernation.   But instead the town is quiet. The bars are empty and flags flyat half mast. The marina is half filled; many of the boats are inthe sound warring with the oil slick.   ``No fishing, no business. No business, no economy. No economy,no Cordova,'' said Bob Van Brucklin, who owns a bar, laundry, moteland warehouse.   Many people attend meeting after meeting, worrying at the futurewhile trying to deal with working on the cleanup for Exxon.   ``The problem with the fishermen is we're used to going out anddoing our own work,'' said Jerry McCune, president of the CordovaDistrict Fishermen United. ``Now we have to take Exxon jobs and sithere and wonder what's going to happen to the salmon fishery.''   The adults aren't the only ones hurting. Cordova's children, useto otters and killer whales in the inlet and bald eagles in thesky, have been traumatized by the spill's carnage.   Linden O'Toole told of her 3-year-old son seeing a box of dead,oiled birds brought in by a fisherman. ``He kept saying, `I want togo `safe' the birds. I want to go `safe' the birds,''' she said.   Whatever happens now, the future of Valdez is assured by the800-mile oil pipeline that fills tankers like the Exxon Valdez. Taxrevenue from it provides 92 percent of the city's $31 millionbudget, a budget 10 times that of Cordova.   The fishermen of Cordova opposed the pipeline.   Some of the ``old-towners,'' the pre-earthquake Valdezresidents, share Cordova's concerns. Pat Day, whose family hasfished for four generations, fears the effects of the spill and isfrustrated by the attitude of some fellow townspeople.   ``What I hear is, `nature will take care of it,''' said Day. ``Ithink she probably will, but it will take 30 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
