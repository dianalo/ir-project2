It will not result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more. There will be no major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions, and it will not havesignificant effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith the foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Thisproposal would provide official slaughtering establishments with voluntaryalternate procedures for use during slaughter operations, by permittingapproved methods of injecting compressed air to facilitate head skinningand the removal of hides and foot hair.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C.601). The proposal would relieve a current regulatory restriction withrespect to the use of air injection into carcasses and parts of carcasses.If promulgated, it would provide all official slaughtering establishmentswith voluntary alternate procedures for use during slaughter operations,by permitting approved methods of compressed air injection without imposingadditional requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Requirements</ITAG>This proposal would require that establishments who wish to test new proceduresfor the use of air, submit requests to FSIS for approval. (This paperworkrequirement will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget forapproval.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this proposal.Written comments should be sent to the Policy Office. Please include thedocket number that appears in the heading of this document. All commentssubmitted in response to this proposal will be made available for publicviewing in the Policy Office between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday throughFriday.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 310.13 of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 310.13)provides, in part, that carcasses or parts of carcasses shall not be inflatedwith air. The original intent in disallowing the use of air was to aidin the prevention of adulterated carcasses or parts of carcasses. In particular,the insanitary use of injected air may contaminate the carcass or partor mask abnormal conditions. Section l(m)(4) of the Federal Meat InspectionAct (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601(m)(4)) provides that any carcass, part thereof,meat or meat food product is adulterated ``if it has been prepared * ** under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated withfilth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. * * *''If the air were unclean or if there were a contaminated injection procedure,the carcass might become contaminated. Additionally, it was felt that thepresence of air in subcutaneous tissues could mask an abnormal conditionsuch as a gas-producing bacterial infection. Section l(m)(8) of the FMIA(21 U.S.C. 601(m)(8)) provides that any carcass, part thereof, meat ormeat food product is adulterated ``* * * if damage or inferiority has beenconcealed in any manner; * * *'' Such adulteration could occur by fillingout hollows in the animal carcass to make the animal appear of better quality.Thus, FSIS prohibited the use of air to inflate carcasses or parts of carcasseson the basis that the air may be used in an insanitary manner or may maskabnormal conditions, resulting in product adulteration under the FMIA.Recently, several establishments requested permission to use injected airfor hide removal. FSIS determined, at that time, that if establishmentscould demonstrate that the use of air would result in wholesome, unadulteratedmeat products, such additional procedures could allow more efficient dressingoperations for slaughter establishments. Therefore, FSIS has permitted,on an experimental basis and under close FSIS monitoring, various usesof air during the dressing operations at several establishments. Theseuses included:(1) Compressed air injected into cattle feet to facilitate the removalof hair from feet intended for human consumption.(2) Compressed air injected into the skull of an animal in conjunctionwith a captive bolt stunner to aid in holding the animal still during thebleeding operation so that fewer injuries to establishment employees wouldoccur.(3) Compressed air injected under the skin of cattle heads to facilitatehead skinning prior to the use of a down hide-puller.(4) Compressed air injected into the abdominal cavity of swine to facilitatethe skinning operation and to minimize the loss of body fat.Many cattle slaughter establishments are currently requesting authorizationto use air injection for hide removal. These establishments wish to accomplishthree things: first, reduce equipment and carcass damage by reducing theamount of tension which must be applied to remove the hide from the headand neck with a down hide-puller; second, prevent damage to the hide inthe removal process; and third, reduce contamination of the head when thehide is removed intact.The above described uses, after field testing, were found to be acceptable.The sanitary injection of air did not mask abnormal carcass conditionsand did not contaminate carcasses or parts. Microbiological testing hasproven that air injection can be sanitary. The Agency now believes thatair injection can be performed in a sanitary manner by a procedure thatincludes air filtration and injection needle disinfection. Air filtrationwould consist of not less than two stages. An initial stage of filtrationwould occur at or near the use point and would consist of an aerosol orcoalescing filter, capable of filtration to not more than 0.75 micron,for the removal of oil and water. A subsequent stage of filtration wouldoccur at or near the point of needle hose attachment to the air line andwould be a particulate filter, capable of filtration to not more than 0.3micron. The injection needle would be disinfected by placement in waterthat is not less than 180 anddegrees;F. for at least 10 seconds immediatelyprior to each injection. Therefore, the Administrator believes it is nowappropriate to propose to amend the Federal meat inspection regulationsto approve the use of injected air as listed in the cited examples.The proposed rule would allow permanent approval of only the compressedair injection activities in the examples listed above. Any official establishmentinterested in the use of air for other than the proposed approved methodswould be required to submit a request for experimental testing of any unapprovedprocedure to FSIS for approval, prior to its use. These requests must statethe purpose of the use of air, a detailed description of the procedure,and evidence that the procedure can be performed in a sanitary manner.Final approval of an acceptable new proposed method would be obtained bymodifying, through rulemaking procedures, the Federal regulations to includethe new method.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 310</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Meat inspection, Post-mortem inspection.For reasons set out in the preamble, Title 9, Part 310 of the Code of FederalRegulations is proposed to be amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 310_POST-MORTEM INSPECTION</ITAG>1.

In any situationwhere the Administrator finds a submitted procedure to be unlikely to resultin wholesome, unadulterated meat product, the Administrator shall sendwritten notification to the establishment of the denial of such approval.The establishment may re-submit for evaluation a testing procedure thathas been denied, provided that modifications have been made to addressthe original reason for denial. The estabishment also shall be affordedan opportunity to submit a written statement in response to the notificationof denial. In those instances where there is a conflict of facts, a hearing,under applicable rules of practice, will be held to resolve the conflict.(iii) Final approval of an acceptable new proposed method shall be effectuatedby modifying, through rulemaking procedures, the Federal regulations toinclude the new method. Uses for which approval is granted are:(A) Compressed air injection of cattle feet to facilitate removal of hairfrom feet intended for human consumption;(B) Compressed air injection to facilitate hide removal, especially ofthe head; or(C) Compressed air injection into the skull in conjunction with a captivebolt stunner to hold the animal still for dressing operations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The method of compressed air injection shall be a sanitary procedurethat includes air filtration and injection needle disinfection.
