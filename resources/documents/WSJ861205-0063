While angry legislators appear likely to slash, or possibly end, aid to the Contras, Israel so far appears unscathed despite President Reagan's statement that the U.S. ally played an active role in secretly selling the arms to Iran and helped funnel some of the proceeds to the Contras. (Israel confirms its part in the arms sale to Iran but denies emphatically it had anything to do with the Contras.)    Take Sen. Larry Pressler, the South Dakota Republican. He supported aid for the Contras last summer but now says he is so angered by the White House's lack of candor that he won't vote for aid to the rebels &quot;for a long time.&quot; He has kinder words for Israel, though: &quot;I've always known the Israelis carried out secret operations for us. I think everyone knows they are our closest allies.&quot;    Israel has long realized that its most important constituency in Washington isn't the White House, but Congress, which approves $3 billion a year in American aid grants to Israel that don't have to be repaid. Israeli officials have expressed concern that this carefully nurtured relationship could be damaged if Israel is seen as circumventing Congress, which banned aid to the Contras in 1984 and reopened the flow only last summer. The diversion of money to the Contras apparently occurred during the congressional ban.    But early indications from American politicians suggest that Israel doesn't have much to fear -- unless more damaging information about its precise role emerges.    &quot;It's the administration that's supposed to uphold American law, not foreign governments,&quot; says Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D., Conn.), a pro-Israel member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who opposes Contra aid. &quot;Should we expect that the ayatollah wouldn't take the arms because it violates U.S. law?&quot; he asks.    And Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), who rejects as &quot;illogical and impossible&quot; the U.S. government's official explanation that only two presidential aides were aware of the Iran-Contra connection, has no trouble accepting the official Israeli explanation that Jerusalem didn't know money was going to the Nicaraguan Contras. &quot;I haven't seen any evidence that (the Israelis) were doing anything but transferring money to an account (in Switzerland). They had no knowledge of what it was for,&quot; he says.    Indeed, Israel's supporters, scanning the horizon for signs of trouble, have found only one congressman who publicly criticized Israel. Rep. Nick Rahall, a relatively obscure West Virginia Democrat, issued a press release calling for a probe of Israel's role in &quot;aiding the president and his cronies and flouting the will of Congress.&quot; He conceded, however, &quot;There will be eyebrows raised and a question here and there asked, and somehow an explanation will be found that will put it in the framework of an ally helping another ally and that will be the end of it.&quot;    Pro-Israel members of Congress defend Israel's role in providing arms to Iran. They contend that, because of Israel's dependence on American aid, it can't say no when the U.S. asks for a favor. &quot;I don't see how it hurts Israel if it serves as middlemen in an operation at the request of the United States,&quot; says Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.).    Mr. Solarz and other pro-Israeli congressmen concede that Israel's political position could worsen if new revelations arise. Indeed, some in the pro-Israel bloc worry that their friend President Reagan may be setting Israel up to take the blame in the secret Contra operation.    Mr. Reagan said in a recent interview with Time magazine, &quot;Another country was facilitating those sales of weapons systems. They then were overcharging, and were apparently putting the money into bank accounts of the leaders of the Contras.&quot; The administration named Israel as the intermediary when it disclosed the Iran-Nicaragua connection last month.    Already, some press reports have indicated Israel wasn't merely carrying out a U.S. request to sell arms to Iran, but may have suggested the idea. And reports from Jerusalem claim Amiram Nir, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's counter-terrorism adviser, was aware that funds were being funneled to the Contras. Yesterday, three Israeli newspapers reported that Israel had for years helped the U.S. administration skirt congressional restrictions by supplying arms to the Contras in a program coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council.    Israeli officials vehemently deny these charges. &quot;Israel has no connection with the Contras in Nicaragua,&quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres insisted this week.    Some critics of Israel maintain that the Iran affair could be a watershed. &quot;I think there's a real lesson in Israel subverting American policy,&quot; says David Sadd, executive director of the National Association of Arab Americans. &quot;It shows that Israel's interests are different from ours, that they are a foreign country and there are times when our interests differ,&quot; he says.    But Jerusalem has tremendous clout on Capitol Hill. Congress gives Israel the largest share of U.S. foreign aid and thwarts the White House by regularly blocking arms sales to Arab states.    One reason that Congress is favorably disposed toward Israel is that nation's enormous political influence. There are more than 70 pro-Israel political action committees that make contributions to lawmakers. Together, these groups can pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into congressional races.    Even Mr. Sadd of the Arab-American group concedes, &quot;I don't think we will ever see the dramatic kind of shift that would say, OK, we'll limit or cut the aid to Israel. The political apparatus is too entrenched for that to happen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
