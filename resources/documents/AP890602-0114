(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A defense consultant and a former Navyengineer received 26-month sentences today for their roles in abribery scheme to obtain secret bid information to help two privatecompanies obtain lucrative Pentagon contracts.   Consultant William A. Parkin, 65, and former Navy seniorengineer Stuart Berlin, 51, were also fined $25,000 apiece by U.S.District Judge Claude Hilton for their roles in the scheme to helpTeledyne Industries Inc. and Hazeltine Corp. obtain contracts.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica acknowledged at theseparate sentencing proceedings that both Parkin and Berlin hadfully cooperated with the Justice Department's continuinginvestigation of Pentagon procurement fraud.   But Aronica said that the receipt of bribes by Berlin ``isperhaps the most serious offense that a government official cancommit. ``It is a violation of the public trust. It is a corruptionthat is motivated by nothing more than his own greed.''   Berlin's defense attorney, Leonard Greenbaum, noted that Berlinhad actually received less than $5,000 in the conspiracy because hewas ``shortchanged at the outset'' by Parkin and others.   Berlin, whose voice cracked during a brief statement to thejudge, called his crime ``the worst mistake that I ever made in mylife.''   Aronica said that Parkin played a key role in the briberyconspiracy because he dealt directly with the defense contractors.Aronica noted that Parkin expected to obtain $272,000 in illegalconsulting fees to buy information from Berlin that would help thetwo firms bid on government contracts.   Parkin's role ``as front man and the individual to whom themoney was to be paid kept the conspiracy afloat,'' Aronica said.   Nine days after sources say he tried to commit suicide with anoverdose of sleeping pills, Parkin, 65, pleaded guilty on March 27to charges he indirectly paid bribes to Berlin for information tohelp his corporate clients get lucrative contracts.   After his guilty plea, Parkin was a star witness against twoTeledyne Industries Inc. executives who were convicted in April ofconspiracy in connection with the scheme to obtain insideinformation on a contract to provide radar test gear to themilitary.   Berlin, 51, also testified at the trial, admitting that he tookthousands of dollars of bribes from defense consultants in returnfor information that would help private companies bid on lucrativecontracts.   Parkin and Berlin could have faced maximum possible sentences of25 years in prison fines up to $750,000 for their crimes.   Parkin, himself a former Navy employee, admitted he took $50,000bribes during a 10-year period when he worked for the governmentbefore 1983.   The two pleaded guilty to participating in a bribery scheme withanother defense consultant, Fred Lackner of Los Angeles, to provideinside information to Teledyne, based in Newbury Park, Calif., andHazeltine Corp., a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis.   Berlin was to share $55,000 of the consulting fees that thecompanies paid to Parkin for his efforts to obtain contracts,according to testimony at the trial of the Teledyne executives.   Eugene R. Sullivan, and George H. Kaub, the Teledyne executives,were each convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud in connection withthe effort to obtain bid information on a radar-detection contract.They are scheduled to be sentenced next week.   Lackner is scheduled to be sentenced July 14 for his guiltypleas to conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud in the scheme to bribeBerlin.   Teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making falsestatements and agreed to pay a $4.3 million fine. The company alsoforfeited $4 million in future profits from an Air Force contract.</TEXT></DOC>
