In the wake of preliminary negotiations that began Friday, Japan is sending Makuto Kuroda, vice minister of trade, here to meet with senior officials of the U.S. trade representative's office. The two sides are expected to discuss additional steps Japan could take to enforce the bilateral semiconductor trade accord signed last summer. But officials said Japan is unlikely to be able to act in time to stave off at least a temporary imposition of the 100% tariffs President Reagan ordered on certain Japanese electronics products beginning April 17.    Meanwhile, U.S. officials disclosed that the administration is considering making those tariffs retroactive to March 31, the day the retaliatory U.S. tariffs were published in the Federal Register. The purpose would be to thwart any attempts by Japanese companies to rush their products to the U.S. to beat the April 17 deadline.    U.S. officials said the Customs Service directed its field offices to require importers to post bonds on any goods shipped after March 31 sufficient to cover any penalty tariffs that may be imposed on April 17. If the April 17 tariffs aren't made retroactive, or if a particular product ends up exempted from the retaliation list, the bonds would be returned. The decision won't be made until close to April 17, but U.S. officials said it's becoming increasingly likely the tariffs will be made retroactive.    The semiconductor accord called for Japanese chip makers to stop dumping -- selling their products below the cost of production or fair market value in Japan -- both in the U.S. and in third-country markets. In addition, Japan agreed to allow U.S. semiconductor producers a larger share of its domestic market.    The U.S. contends Japan hasn't lived up to either provision. As a result, Mr. Reagan said March 27 he would retaliate. </TEXT></DOC>
