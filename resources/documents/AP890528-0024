The report, issued by a Georgian commission that looked into theApril 9 clash that left 19 dead, was circulated among deputies tothe new Soviet parliament, which met during the weekend.   The report calls for the parliament, the Congress of People'sDeputies, to condemn the incident and determine who exactly wasresponsible.   ``Otherwise,'' the report said, ``a shadow will be laid acrossthe Soviet government as a whole.''   The report gives a horrifying account of troops' behavior in the4 a.m. clash with protesters. It also supports claims of Georgianactivists who accused soldiers of extreme brutality.   Soldiers ``blocked crossings, surrounded citizens and beat themwith clubs and shovels. They did not spare hunger strikers, girls,old women, doctors and Red Cross workers. They pursued people whowere running away and beat the wounded even more, tearing them fromthe hands of medical personnel,'' the report says.   ``We come to the conclusion that the action taken ... carriesthe signs of a punitive operation _ a planned mass massacre,committed with special cruelty,'' the commission reported.   The panel, sponsored by the Georgian parliament, also saidGeorgian television announced a curfew the day after the clash onlyfour minutes before it went into effect, so many residents werecaught on the streets unaware. One young man was shot and killedfor violating the curfew.   It said the Soviet media distorted coverage of the clash and itsaftermath and it blamed local leaders for ``complete isolation fromthe people.''   A medical subcommittee's findings repeated widespread criticismof the Defense and Interior Ministries for not telling doctors forseveral days exactly what sort of gas was used to controlprotesters.   Western doctors who conducted autopsies have said the gases,described as suffocants, caused some of the deaths.   Also, more than 4,000 people have required treatment, mainly forpoisoning, and diagnosis and treatment would have been much easierif authorities had acknowledged earlier that they used a chemicalagent, the report said.   A Soviet magazine recently carried an interview with Georgianchief Prosecutor Vakhtang Razmadze, who said representatives of theCommunist Party, the government and the military attended themeeting at which the decision was made to use troops to break upthe demonstration.   They included Georgian party chief Zhumber Patiashvili, wholater resigned, General Igor Rodionov, the regional militarycommander, who is now a deputy at the Congress, and a deputynational defense minister.   The account was consistent with a claim made Thursday byPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Congress. He said he andother Politburo members found out about the decision to bring introops only hours after the damage was done.   Protests began in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, in early April inresponse to demands by the Abkhazian minority in northwest Georgiato have their area transferred to the Russian republic.</TEXT></DOC>
