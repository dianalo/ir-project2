Kerry as a Leftist DemonBut He Says He's Just a Mainstream Politician---By David ShribmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The demonization of John Kerry has begun.    The chairman of the Conservative Caucus has taken to describing him as &quot;the consummate political opportunist of the left.&quot; The publisher of Conservative Digest characterizes him as &quot;the most extreme member of the Senate.&quot; Other conservatives call him the &quot;senator from Managua.&quot;    By most measures, Sen. John Kerry, 43 years old, isn't a leading figure in the Senate. He is a freshman lawmaker who, because he so often stands in the shadow of Edward Kennedy, is sometimes known as the other senator from Massachusetts. His name appears on a smattering of bills, but he hasn't accounted for an astonishing legislative output. He's hardly ever on television and isn't usually quoted in newspapers outside his own state.    But in the past several months, as the conservative establishment has reeled under the effects of the Iran-Contra affair, John Kerry has emerged as the leading magnet for criticism from the right. &quot;We feel,&quot; says Richard Viguerie, a New Right leader and a conservative fund-raising specialist, &quot;that he is a very dangerous radical.&quot;    The transformation of Mr. Kerry from lawmaker to symbol accelerated last year when, as the leadership's second choice, he was selected as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the party's formal campaign and fund-raising effort to retain control of the Senate in next year's election.    &quot;These people are out to get a target,&quot; says Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.). &quot;Maybe Ted Kennedy has worn out and they need a new one.&quot;    With the fading of Mr. Kennedy from presidential politics and with the retirement of the other prominent Massachusetts liberal Democrat, former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Mr. Kerry has become a favorite target of conservatives. As the newest bogeyman on the political scene, he's playing the role for conservatives that Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) often plays for liberals.    And yet Mr. Kerry is far more important as a symbol to the right than as a voice for the left.    While Mr. Kerry's press clippings from liberal journals have been modest, he makes regular appearances in the organs of the right. In a piece that described him as &quot;the most peculiar man in the Senate,&quot; Conservative Digest last month accused Mr. Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran who returned to become an outspoken critic of the war, as being &quot;as far to the left as he was when he appeared on the national scene as a disaffected veteran making excuses for the Vietcong.&quot; It added that he &quot;spat his poison to the hosannas of the usual Communists, kooks and America Lasters.&quot;    The conservative Washington Times newspaper accused him of covering up evidence that the Sandinista government of Nicaragua was involved in drug smuggling -- a charge he calls &quot;contrived and fraudulent.&quot; Human Events, the conservative weekly, describes him as &quot;radical Sen. John Kerry.&quot; Even at a luncheon last week at the New Republic magazine, he received a hostile reception from foreign policy hardliners.    Mr. Kerry has, to be sure, given the right some ammunition. He and Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), both freshly elected, traveled to Managua in 1985, met with Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, and returned to Washington carrying the message that Mr. Ortega was willing to consider a cease-fire. They were swiftly branded as Sandinista sympathizers by lawmakers who resented the effrontery of the freshmen's trip. &quot;Everybody thought they were being taken,&quot; says one Democrat.    Now Sen. Kerry is one of the most outspoken critics of the Nicaraguan Contras -- &quot;far from being freedom fighters,&quot; he said of them in a speech at Harvard last summer, &quot;they are engaged in their own brand of terrorism with bullets that are directed against innocents, against children&quot; -- but he has been careful to call for a Central America free of Soviet bases and Cuban and Russian military advisers. He has criticized the Sandinistas for their repression against the church and the press.    &quot;I do get disturbed when I read these things,&quot; Mr. Kerry says. &quot;My thinking has been so mainstream, so attached to traditional American values, that it all surprises me.&quot;    Even so, Conservative Digest publisher William Kennedy argues that Mr. Kerry &quot;is constantly taking a pro-Sandinista, pro-Communist position&quot; and says, &quot;I'd like to know why he thinks everything the Contras do is bad.&quot; Thomas Winter, the editor of Human Events, adds: &quot;He's one of the most visible defenders of the Sandinistas at a time when so few defend them.&quot; But the force of the fury from the right surprises Mr. Kerry, who repeatedly uses the word &quot;mainstream&quot; to describe his positions, especially his support for the Gramm-Rudman legislation to eliminate the federal budget deficit and his drive for increased enforcement of the federal tax code.    &quot;I am really tired of having my patriotism impugned by this crowd,&quot; says Mr. Kerry. &quot;I have fought and bled for this country. I voted for a $300 billion defense budget last year.&quot;    Conservatives, however, have never forgiven Mr. Kerry for his leadership of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, his criticism of the conduct of the war and his involvement in an incident that led to the return of veterans' medals, though not to the return of his own.    &quot;A lot of the leaders who are emerging in the conservative movement are from the Vietnam generation,&quot; says Howard Phillips, the chairman of the Conservative Caucus. &quot;They have the highest contempt for him.&quot;    Sen. Kerry's Democratic colleagues sometimes fault him for his vanity and his ambition, but they argue that the ferocity of the attacks against the Massachusetts lawmaker is unjustified.    &quot;He's not a radical or a revolutionary,&quot; says Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. &quot;He works pretty well within the system.&quot;    Earlier this decade, the National Republican Senatorial Committee routinely sent out fund-raising entreaties warning that &quot;Ted Kennedy could control the Senate&quot; if the GOP lost its majority, which it retained until last November's election. Now conservatives are warning that they are monitoring Mr. Kerry's activities and may base fund-raising appeals on the need to limit his influence.    &quot;We're going to use his statements,&quot; says Mr. Viguerie. &quot;He is really committed to the radical leftist agenda, and he'll become a real lightning rod. Conservatives will respond. He'll become a household word, and causes he espouses will automatically get opposition from conservatives and Republicans.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
