The pizza restaurant chain ended the merger agreement with Pizza Inn Acquiring Corp., under which shareholders were to receive $12.50 for each share of Pizza Inn stock, or about $38 million. The management group was unable to get financing for its leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Under the agreement with Pantera's, a St. Louis-based pizza restaurant operator, Pizza Inn shareholders would receive about $14.50 in cash and Pantera's stock for each Pizza Inn share. The transaction is valued at about $48 million. Pizza Inn has about 3.3 million shares outstanding.    Pizza Inn stock closed yesterday in American Stock Exchange composite trading at $13 a share, up 12.5 cents.    The Pizza Inn directors extended the agreement to enable directors to consider a definitive agreement with Pantera's at a board meeting today, Pizza Inn said.    Pantera's, which would become the nation's fourth-largest pizza restaurant operator in buying Pizza Inn, said it also extended the agreement to allow for Pizza Inn's vote. In addition, Pantera's received a &quot;highly confident letter&quot; from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., indicating a strong possibility that the investment banker can arrange financing for the transaction, Pantera's said. </TEXT></DOC>
