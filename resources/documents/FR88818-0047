The finalrule implementing Amendment 5 went into effect on January 14, 1988 (52FR 47572, December 15, 1987). Several provisions contained in Amendment5 relating to escape vent panels and reporting requirements were omittedfrom the proposed (52 FR 28028, July 27, 1987) and final rule. This proposedrule was developed to implement these omitted provisions. The regulations implementing Amendment 5 require that all lobster trapsused in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) have a minimum of twoescape vent panels that meet certain specifications. The amendment alsospecified that the two panels should be placed opposite each other in thetrap. This latter provision was omitted from the proposed and final rules.Based on at-sea trials conducted by NMFS, escape panels of the size andconfiguration described in the FMP were judged by the Council to be themost compatible with the management goals and needs of the fishery. Tocomply fully with the intent of the FMP regarding the configuration ofescape vent panels, this proposed rule would amend the regulations to requirethat the panels in each trap be placed opposite each other. All permitholders in the NWHI lobster fishery have been advised of the escape ventconfiguration recommended in the FMP and of NMFS' intent to amend the regulationaccordingly. Amendment 5 also provided for a number of changes in FMP reporting requirements.The permit application form and daily catch log report were amended toadd information requests needed for management of the lobster fishery.The requirement for an annual processor's report was eliminated and theTrip Processing and Sales Report was replaced by the Lobster Report forTransshipment and Sales. All of the proposed changes in reporting requirements,as approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the PaperworkReduction Act, were incorporated in the final rule except for the proposedLobster Report for Transshipment and Sales. The final rule provided forcollection of transshipment and sales data on the daily catch report, butdid not provide for replacement of the Trip Processing and Sales Reportwith the Lobster Report for Transshipment and Sales as provided in Amendment5. The new report is structured to provide information on the amount of lobstersand their incidental catch sold or transshipped to points within or outsideof the State of landing. The revenue information generated by this reportis needed to define the economic profile of the fishery for future managementdecisions. The proposed new reporting form is less confusing than the original formand better reflects the current structure of the fishery. Accordingly,the proposed rule would amend the regulatory text to require use of thenew Lobster Report for Transshipment and Sales, in place of the formerTrip Processing and Sales Report. An additional technical change is proposed to replace the words ``CenterDirector'' with the words ``Regional Director'' in andSection;andSection; 681.4(b)(2)(xxi)and 681.5(b)(2)(x) to accurately reflect management responsibility. The word ``unobstructed'' is proposed to be added to the description ofcircular holes in escape vent panels in andSection; 681.24(c)(1) to clarifythe Council's original intent in Amendment 5 to the FMP.The measures proposed in Amendment 5 were presented at a public informationmeeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on April 29, 1986 and at a public hearingin Honolulu on May 18, 1987. All lobster fishery permit holders have beenkept apprised of the issues contained in Amendment 5 and have been requestedto offer comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that thismeasure is necessary for the conservation and management of the crustacianfishery of the western Pacific region and that it is consistent with theMagnuson Act and other applicable law. The Council prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the originalFMP. An environmental assessment (EA) was also incorporated into Amendment5. The measures proposed to be implemented by this rule were included inAmendment 5, so the Assistant Administrator has concluded that this actionfalls within the categorical exclusion identified in the environmentalreview procedures in NOAA Directives Manual 02-10 at 5(b)(3)(a). Consequently,no additional environmental document has been prepared. A copy of the amendment,incorporating the EA, and the FMP's EIS can be obtained from the RegionalDirector at the above address. The Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA determined that thisrule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis underExecutive Order 12291. The present action will not have a cumulative effecton the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in a major increasein costs to consumers, industries, government agencies, or geographicalregions. No significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or competitiveness of U.S.-based enterprisesare anticipated. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This is because the industry has already anticipated theproposed action to incorporate in the regulations requirements for escapevents and reporting which were approved under Amendment 5 but inadvertentlyomitted from the proposed and final rules for the amendment. There areapproximately 40 permit holders in the fishery, although only a small percentageof them actually fish. All permittees were advised and were fully awareof the requirements for escape vents to be placed opposite each other duringthe rulemaking procedures in 1987. In addition, the sold manufacturer oftraps began producing traps with vents placed opposite each other in November,1987. As a result, a majority of the industry has already complied withthe vent requirements, and most, if not all, traps now have escape vents.Conversion of those few traps which have not yet been converted would notimpose a significant cost on the industry. The burden associated with the revised reporting requirement will be thesame as that reported in the final rule implementing Amendment 5 to theFMP. The replacement of the Trip Processing and Sales Report with the newLobster Report for Transshipment and Sales will not significantly changethe burden hours, while providing data essential for the management ofthe fishery. The annual reporting burden for all fishermen was erroneouslyreported as 54 hours in the classification section of the final rule toAmendment 5 but actually had been calculated and approved by OMB as 48hours, or 4 hours per fisherman (each of the 12 vessels fishing will incura burden of 10 minutes per report for each of their 24 trips per year).This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement at andSection;681.5 subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. This requirement has beenpreviously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underControl Number 0648-0193. The Council has determined, and the appropriate State and territorial governmentoffices have found that the measures established in Amendment 5, includingthe measures implemented by this proposed rule, are consistent to the maximumextent practicable with the approved coastal zone management programs ofHawaii and the territories of American Somoa and Guam. The proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 681</ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 15, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
