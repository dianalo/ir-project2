But the judge's order doesn't affect the leadership of the local union, which prosecutors contended was corrupt in a civil lawsuit filed last October. The government still seeks the appointment of a trustee to run Local 359 of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.    Officials at the union couldn't be reached for comment.    Federal Judge Thomas P. Griesa will choose the administrator from two lists, one submitted by the U.S. attorney's office and the other by the defendants in the suit.    Judge Griesa's order grew out of the October civil suit, which was the government's first attempt to control the operations of an entire commercial center allegedly dominated by organized crime. The market is in lower Manhattan.    The federal racketeering complaint alleged that organized crime, through the union, has dominated the market and extorted money from market businesses by threatening disobedient employers with labor problems, work stoppages, theft or other punishment. Defendants in the suit were the union and 28 alleged members and associates of the Genovese crime family.    Last Friday, 25 of those defendants signed a consent agreement -- without admitting to any allegations in the government's complaint -- that bars them from having further dealings with the market. Three defendants who didn't agree to consent judgments were ordered by default not to participate in the fish market. Neither judgment may be appealed. </TEXT></DOC>
