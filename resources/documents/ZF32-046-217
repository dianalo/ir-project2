(DEC,Maynard, MA) and QMS (Mobile, AL) both offer heavy-duty printers with TCP/IPnetwork interfaces.andP;  Directly connecting printers to networks also improvesprinter throughput by allowing processing to occur at faster networktransmission speeds, instead of squeezing data through comparatively slowparallel or serial ports.andM;&quot;Printers will almost all end up with network interfaces because they offerthe flexibility of placement and better throughput, especially for colorgraphics,&quot; says Joe Murray, a product marketing manager with Tektronix'sColor Printing Division (Wilsonville, OR).andM;&quot;The market will evolve to direct network printing,&quot; agrees Balaban.andM;The next step will be using chip technology to develop internal cards forhigh-end printers.andP;  &quot;Networks have a maximum data capacity,&quot; Balaban says.andO;&quot;With the overhead associated with TCP/IP, you don't get 10Mbps throughput.&quot;andM;Even though a direct network connection is the most efficient way to print ona network, companies should consider whether the network can handle theadditional traffic that printing large files over the network will create,Ells says.andP;  In some cases, locally connected printers may be a better option.andM;FASTER THAN ETHERNETandM;An interface that's faster than the Ethernet might be the answer, shesuggests.andP;  &quot;Printer vendors are looking for faster interfaces, faster thanEthernet and much faster than parallel attachments,&quot; Ells says.andP;  &quot;They'relooking at the SCSI interface because that would give you higher input.&quot;andM;&quot;SCSI has substantial throughput, but it's limited in transmission length,&quot;says Abe Litman, DEC's marketing  manager  for  PrintServers.andP;  &quot;Fasterinterfaces  will come.andP;  I'm not convinced that with an 11 to 30 ppm [page perminute] printer [SCSI is] mandatory.andP;  There's enough bandwidth on Ethernet tohandle the print loads for that class of printer, even when they're complex.andO;andlsqb;If you have a lot of large and complex jobs] maybe you need a directlyattached printer rather than one that's going over the network.&quot;andM;Whether the interface is Ethernet or SCSI, &quot;data compression will become moreimportant,&quot; Murray says.andP;  (Adobe Systems PostScript level 2's use ofcompression technology is expected to help speed up graphics printing.)andM;SMARTER PRINTERSandM;While the trend is toward direct-connect printers, users also are demandingmore intelligence in their printers.andP;  &quot;Making the physical connection is onlyhalf the battle,&quot; says Marty Kennedy, a product manager at QMS.andP;  &quot;If youdon't do all the aspects of managing the memory on your printer and doing thespooling, you have accomplished only half [of the job].&quot;andM;Users need more control of the print functions, and they're only beginning toget it.andP;  &quot;From the time the user requests a print job to the time it'sfinished, we need to have the ability to manage that job.andP;  andlsqb;That includes]changing priorities, font servicing, redirecting [print  jobs], and findingout the current status [of jobs],&quot; Bazaar says.andP;  &quot;Most common spoolingutilities in the Unix platform are deficient in these areas.andP;  That's whereprinter vendors are going to develop something on their own.andP;  All of the datathat you would like to have to manage a remote printer could become availablewith SNMP [Simple Network Management Protocol].&quot;andM;Print servers also can provide management functions.andP;  &quot;Print servers haveprimarily been print spoolers on networks,&quot; says Bill Gott, a senior industryanalyst at InfoCorp (Santa Clara, CA).andP;  &quot;They haven't managed the printfunctions.andP;  We're seeing some movement of print servers toward taking controlof the print function, approaching what a user sitting in front of theprinter would have, as well as some added functions such as record keeping.&quot;andM;PRINT SERVER IN A BOXandM;Companies that offer TCP/IP print servers include Microplex, Emulex, MiLANTechnology (Mountain View, CA), and Xyplex (Boxborough, MA).andP;  Tektronix alsooffers a print server for two of its color printers (see sidebar on page 129,&quot;Tektronix Offers TCP/IP Options&quot;).andM;* Microplex offers the M200 NetPrint print server for Ethernet networksrunning TCP/IP.andP;  The M200, which supports thick and thin Ethernet, has oneparallel and two serial ports.andP;  It uses a 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor toimprove spooling throughput.andM;Its parallel port can sustain data rates of 50,000 characters per second.andO;Using direct memory access allows &quot;the M200 to output to the printer at theparallel rate.andP;  It can send as fast as the cable will accept it,&quot; saysBalaban.andM;The serial ports each operate at up to 38Kbps.andP;  All three ports can outputdata simultaneously.andP;  One serial port acts as a console port, which enables apersonal computer or terminal to configure the print server's parameters,load IP addresses, and perform diagnostics.andM;TCP/IP and host software handle connection setup and communication for datatransfer.andP;  The print server's communication drivers interface to Unix 1pd forhost spooling and allow multiple-host access to printers.andP;  Microplex offersdrivers for SCO Xenix, Unix, and Sun OS.andM;* Emulex offers three print servers that run on TCP/IP and LAT networks.andP;  ThePerformance 3000 has two built-in serial ports and four slot that canaccommodate serial or parallel ports.andP;  The six ports can simultaneouslyaccept an aggregate through put of 60,000 characters per second.andP;  It supportsthick and thin Ethernet.andP;  The base unit with two serial ports costs $2,595.andO;Port packs for the additional slots cost $200 each.andP;  Fully configured withsix ports, the P3000 costs $3,395.andM;The Performance 2504, which costs $1,850, bas one parallel port and fourserial ports for printers or terminal servers.andP;  The Performance 2501 is adedicated print server with single port that can support a 35 pp printer.andO;The P2501 is scheduled to ship this month and will be approximately $1,200.andM;* The Esprint TCP/IP network print server from MILAN has one parallel and oneserial port.andP;  &quot;This box is our attempt to try to make printing simpler,faster, and more affordable on Unix networks,&quot; says Dan Eakins, a vicepresident at MILAN.andM;Using a 16-bit Intel 186 processor, Esprint offers 30KBps sustained TCP/IPtransfers through its parallel port.andP;  The Esprint, scheduled to ship thismonth, costs $899.andP;  It supports thin, thick, and 10BaseT Ethernet.andP;  A networkuser can print files over the network under Unix print utilities such as lprand lpd.andP;  The box contains nonvolatile RAM for storing its IP address and asoftware-loadable EPROM.andM;* The Maxserver 1400, a print server from Xyplex, supports transparentsharing of printers between and LAT hosts.andP;  The MX-1400, which costs $1,895,has two serial and two parallel ports.andP;  It can be managed using SNMP.andM;Xyplex also offers a Network Printer Card (NPC), which plugs into a slot onthe company's Maxserver LANBus communications chassis.andP;  The NPC has oneserial, one parallel, and one RS-232 port.andP;  It is priced at $995.andM;Both Xyplex products use TCP/ IP to send files from Unix workstations toprinters.andP;  They each require the company's MultiProtocol Communication Serversoftware kit, which costs $200.andP;  The software includes C source code for aprinter output filter that can be customized for Unix hosts.andP;  The systemsadministrator downloads the software from a Unix, VMS, or Ultrix host to theprint server.andM;The print servers also require client software.andP;  VMS hosts include thenecessary client support.andP;  Xyplex provide Shared Printer software for Unixworkstations.andM;THE SOFTWARE APPROACHandM;FTP Software (Wakefield, MA) offers a software-only print server, whichhandles print requests from an lpr or equivalent client that complies withUnix BSD 4.x.andP;  &quot;PC/LPD uses TCP/IP as a transport to accept print files andto respond to questions about what's going on at the printer,&quot; says BruceCampbell, FTP's director of marketing.andM;Printers connected to the print server accept lpr, lpq, and lprm commands.andP;  Auser can spool print files on a dedicated PC or on a Unix machine, while pageprocessing happens on the print server.andP;  The print server can accept eightsimultaneous connections using its default setting, or it can be configuredto accept more connections if it has sufficient memory.andM;PC/LPD runs across bridges, gateways, and routers.andP;  Its users can controlindividual printers, each printer's queue, and print server operations.andP;  Theyalso can  access operating data, such as printer operation statistics andprint queue lists.andP;  The software can display more than 30 error messages.andM;PC/LPD, which costs $400 per PC, requires a dedicated IBM PC, AT, PS/2, orcompatible machine with a supported network interface card, DOS 3.1 orhigher, a 20MB hard disk, and 640KB RAM.andP;  The software supports more than 70Ethernet, 10BaseT, Token Ring, X.25, and Starlan adapters.andM;HIGH-END PRINTERSandM;While FTP's print server offers a lowend TCP/IP printing choice, DigitalEquipment's PrintServer family offers elegant high-end options.andM;DEC has been a leader in printer-sharing technology.andP;  Its PrintServerprinters can be shared across heterogeneous networks, including Unix, VMS,MicroVMS, and Ultrix networks, as well as PC, OS/2, and Macintosh networksthrough DEC's Pathworks.andM;&quot;Digital Equipment is pushing the concept of network printing and printmanagement across the network and integrated within the systemsapplications,&quot; Gott says.andP;  &quot;The DECnet system and applications that operatewith that system are making a strong case for integrating applications,server, peripherals, and the network.&quot;andM;The turbo PrintServer 20, which costs $19,495, is a 20 ppm departmentalprinter with duplex capabilities.andP;  The PrintServer 40 plus is a 40 ppmprinter with a MicroVAX CPU.andP;  Prices for the PrintServer 40 plus start at$39,900.andP;  Both printers support paper sizes up to 11-inch by 17-inch and havea resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi).andM;PostScript software, with 29 standard typefaces, handles page composition.andO;PrintServer software manages the print functions, providing the communicationbetween a computer requesting a print job and the printer.andM;All PrintServer printers support TCP/IP, but only the PrintServer 20simultaneously supports both TCP/ IP and DECnet.andP;  A network administrator hasto choose TCP/IP or DECnet when booting the PrintServer 40 plus.andP;  Bothprinters directly support thick Ethernet and twisted-pair cable, as well asthin Ethernet through a transceiver.andM;Typically 20 to 40 users share a PrintServer, depending on the printing load.andO;The workstation requesting a print job spools the job and maintains a printjob queue.andP;  The printer takes one job at a time, composing its pages intobit-mapped images before printing them.andP;  The printer communicates with theworkstation sending the job; for example, it notifies a user when a job issuccessfully completed or if a problem exists, such as the printer is out ofpaper.andM;The PrintServer software, which contains the printer's intelligence, has hostand client components.andP;  The host software, which resides on a dedicated ornondedicated workstation, downloads information into the PrintServer to giveit intelligence.andM;The host software also provides error logging, supplies the centralizedprinter usage accounting, and reboots the printer  for example, after a poweroutage.andP;  Usage information, which can be used for charging departments,includes jobs, users, and CPU time.andP;  The software license allows a company toinstall a copy of the host software on one CPU and one backup CPU.andM;Because queue management happens on the host computer, QMS's Kennedy says,processing can be slow.andP;  &quot;The PostScript conversion on the host spends CPUcycles on translation, [resulting in increased] overhead,&quot; he says.andM;The client software allows a workstation to send print jobs directly to aPrintServer.andP;  Some VAXs, including those running Ultrix 4.0, do not requireclient software.andP;  Separate client versions are offered for Unix BSD, Ultrix,and VMS.andP;  The client software includes translators for nonPostScript files,but this function requires that the user know what data type files containand how to set up print queues.andM;The client software license is issued per printer with no limit on the numberof users.andM;ANOTHER HEAVY-DUTY OPTIONandM;QMS also offers a heavy-duty printer that can connect directly to networksthrough an optional built-in interface for DECnet or TCP/IP.andP;  Because theEthernet card is built in, the QMS-PS 2000 appears as a node on an Ethernetnetwork.andM;&quot;We provide host software to make it a transparent fit into thatenvironment,&quot; says Kennedy.andP;  &quot;The biggest Ethernet benefit is fast datatransfer to the printer.andP;  The host never has to stop sending the data.&quot;andM;The PS 2000, a 20 ppm printer, has multiple active ports and automaticemulation switching.andP;  Serial, parallel, and AppleTalk ports are standard.andP;  Anoptional DECnet or TCP/IP interface costs  1,995.andP;  All four interfaces can besimultaneously active; a user-configurable input buffer allows any interfaceto accept print data while another interface is being used.andM;Although the host still spools files, the printer can offload them faster.andO;&quot;Whatever host you're using doesn't have to spend its CPU cycles managing theprinters,&quot; Kennedy says.andP;  &quot;The System 2000 has a dedicated daughter card, aseparate CPU, IMB of RAM, and IMB of ROM just handling network traffic.&quot;andO;Approximately 20 to 50 jobs can be queued in the printer at a time.andP;  Anoptional hard disk with a scheme for virtual memory adds local spooling andcaching capabilities.andM;The PS 2000 costs $15,995 for the base unit and more than $20,000 withoptions.andP;  QMS plans to add Token Ring, EtherTalk, and IBM 3270 support laterthis year.andM;This 300 dpi printer uses a MIPS R3000 RISC-based internal controller with8MB RAM and optional 40MB or 120MB SCSI hard drives, which are priced at $995and $1,795, respectively.andP;  The printer also ships with a 1.44MB, 3.25-inchfloppy drive to load fonts or emulation into RAM or on to a hard disk.andP;  Anadd-on unit with a duplex option and 1,000sheet feeder costs $3,495.andM;PostScript, PCL 4, HewlettPackard Graphics Language, and DEC LN03+ arestandard languages.andP;  A total of 45 PostScript typefaces are resident.andM;CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUNandM;Although  departmental  printers, such as the QMS PS2000 and the DECPrintServer, might seem prohibitively expensive at first glance, companiesneed to consider the long-term costs of buying, installing, and maintaininglower-cost printers attached to workstations.andP;  The direct-connect printersmay be cheaper in the long run and may help solve many of the problemscurrently plaguing network printing.andM;Shared Printers Gain ShareandM;Although lower-end, work-group printers, such as the Hewlett-Packard LaserJetIIIsi, are growing at a higher percentage rate, high-end, TCP/IP-orientedprinters are experiencing good growth, says Bill Gott, a senior industryanalyst at InfoCorp (Santa Clara, CA).andM;Last year, 85 percent of 15 to 30 page per minute (ppm) printers were shared;in 1992, 95 percent of these printers will be shared.andP;  Gott forecasts that59,000 15 to 30 ppm printers will ship this year and that 12 1,000 will shipin 1992, with a 67 percent compound annual growth from 1991 to 1996.andM;He has revised and increased his forecast based on factors such as anincreased emphasis on networks and network printing, price reductions,improved printer performance-including direct network interfaces, heavierduty cycles, and higher paper capacity to handle multiple-user printapplications.andM;The Unix environment is balanced between impact printers-such as dotmatrix-and nonimpact printers-such as laser, says Barbara Ells, a seniorconsultant at MWA Consulting (Palo Alto, CA).andP;  Impact printers are usuallypersonal, as are nonimpact printers under 6 to 8 ppm.andP;  Printers above 8 ppmare typically shared.andM;&quot;The Unix marketplace is 5 percent of the PC marketplace,&quot; says Ells.andP;  &quot;It'sgrowing faster, but it's a much smaller base.&quot;andM;Tektronix Offers TCP/IP Opt onandM;Although color printing adds a lot of traffic to the network, the cost ofcolor printers make them prime candidates for shared devices.andM;Tektronix's Color Printing Division (Wilsonville, OR) connects its Phaser IIDXN and Phaser II PXN thermal wax color printers to TCP/ IP and LAT networks.andO;Each printer connects to a thick or thin Ethernet network through an externalbox that acts as a print server.andM;&quot;Our printer understands the lpd daemon a layer below lpr; it understands lprcommands and talks the TCP/IP protocol,&quot; says Joe Murray, a Tektronix productmarketing manager.andP;  &quot;It's like having a protocol converter box.andP;  Keeping itat that simple level allows you to put a color printer anywhere on thenetwork.&quot;andM;The 4511 network interface box has a nine-pin connector and a coax connectorthat attaches to the printer's parallel port.andP;  Because the box understandsTCP/IP and the Unix lpr command, a system administrator does not have todownload this information.andP;  A floppy disk formatted in DOS is used to loadnetwork addresses in the box.andM;Both printers are compatible with workstations running Unix BSD 4.3 or ATandamp;T'sUnix System V with lpr extensions.andP;  They have 300 dpi resolution and a I ppmspeed.andM;The Phaser II DXN can handle simultaneous input from its parallel and SCSIinterface ports.andP;  The DXN has 5MB to 13MB of memory, a Motorola 68020processor, and support for 16.7 million colors; a multiplexer with threeparallel ports is optional.andM;The Phaser II PXN can automatically switch among its parallel, serial, andAppleTalk ports.andP;  The PXN has 6MB to 10MB of memory, supports an unlimitednumber of colors, has a Motorola 16MHz 68020 processor, and is compatiblewith Color PostScript and HewlettPackard Graphics Language.andP;  An external SCSIhard drive is optional.andP;  The Phaser III DXN costs $11,995, and the Phaser IIPXN costs $10,995.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
