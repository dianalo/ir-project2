Prior to its participation in the coagulation cascade, factorV is converted to factor V/sub a/ by thrombin generating a heavy chainand a light chain, and these two chains are held together by calciumions. A connecting region originally located between the heavy and lightchains is liberated during the activation reaction. In a previous study,a cDNA of 2970 nucleotides that codes for the carboxyl-terminal 938 aminoacids of factor V was isolated and characterized from a Hep G2 cDNA library.This cDNA has been used to obtain additional clones from Hep G2 and humanliver cDNA libraries. Furthermore, a Hep G2 cDNA library prepared withan oligonucleotide from the 5' end of these cDNAs was screened to obtainoverlapping cDNA clones that code for the amino-terminal region of themolecule. The composite sequence of these clones spans 6911 nucleotidesand is consistent with the size of the factor V message present in HepG2 cells (approximately 7 kilobases). The cDNA codes for a leader sequenceof 28 amino acids and a mature protein of 2196 amino acids. The aminoacid sequence predicted from the cDNA was in complete agreement with139 amino acid residues that were identified by Edman degradation ofcyanogen bromide peptides isolated from the heavy chain region and connectingregion of plasma factor V. The domain structure of human factor V issimilar to that previously reported for human coagulation factor VIII.Two types of tandem repeats (17 and 9 amino acids) have also been identifiedin the connecting region of factor V. The present data indicate thatthe amino acid sequence in the heavy and light chain regions of factorV is {similar_to} 40% identical with the corresponding regions of factorVIII.</TEXT></DOC>
