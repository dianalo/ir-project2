(management).andO;Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Topic:     Market AnalysisIndustry AnalysisMicrocomputersOS-2UpgradingUser NeedsTrends.andO;Person:    Gassee, Jean-Louis (resignation, retirement, etc.).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Aandgt; Prompt Rumors, Bits, and Bytes with Andrew M. SeyboldandM;80386 PricingandM;Over the past few weeks, I have noticed more and more advertisements for80386-based clones at increasingly lower prices.andP;  Case in point, Fry'sElectronics in Santa Clara recently offered an 80386 system complete with EGAmonitor and video card, 2MBs of RAM, and a pair of floppy disk drives for$1686.andP;  No hard drive was included but there is a choice of drives rangingfrom 40MBs to over 100MBs at very reasonable prices.andM;Pricing this system with an 80MB hard drive, the total system price is stillunder $3000 for a 20 MHz, zero-wait state machine.andP;  This is not the only suchad I have seen recently, just one of the more aggressive ones.andP;  Of course,the 80286 and 8088 systems are coming down faster than you can follow.andO;However, it is very evident that list prices in the 80386 and 80386SX areaare meaningless at this point in time and, in fact, you can make some prettygood deals on even the top brands of machines.andM;Apple dealers are also following with lowered prices.andP;  Recently, my realestate broker purchased an SE with 40MB hard drive for right around $2200which included two MBs of RAM and the extended keyboard.andP;  While on a recenttrip to Toronto, I saw an ad for a Macintosh Plus at a 24% discount level inthe local paper.andP;  This was not the only Macintosh product listed at so deep adiscount.andP;  When a dealer is making so little per unit you wonder what makesthem willing to sell systems at that discount level.andM;Clearly, the reports in the paper of this being a soft year for computervendors may be leading to this deep discounting.andP;  A recent report in BusinessWeek claims that overall growth in the PC market will be around 5%.andP;  Thisincluded a little over 10% growth in the North America hardware marketcoupled with a much slower growth in peripherals and software for theaggregate of the 5%.andP;  The same article also acknowledged that growthoverseas, especially in Europe, would be several points higher than thatlisted for us here.andM;The article also cited several industry people as saying that part of theslowdown is due to market saturation and partly due to people waiting to seewhich new operating system to implement and what new software is availablefor it.andM;I can agree with the wait and see attitude which they blame for some of theslowdown, but I do not believe that market saturation has anything to do withit.andP;  I do not, for a moment, believe that the PC industry has reachedanywhere near saturation.andP;  Saturation means a PC on every desk in everycompany in the US and most of the rest of the world.andP;  It means laptops beingcarried by 30% of the traveling public, handheld computers by 20% or so, andmany, many users with more than one system available to them on a dailybasis.andM;Software lags behind...andM;It is common knowledge that software development lags behind hardwaredevelopment.andP;  It is also general knowledge that DOS, Windows, Desq View, andOS/2 with Presentation Manager are confusing users.andP;  Apple, for its part, isworking on a new operating system which will make the Macintosh systems evenmore friendly and useable, but they do not have a very good product mix,especially on the low-end of the spectrum.andM;Now, if you add in the delays that we have all encountered in the area ofnetworking and the high price of outfitting a computer to run OS/2, you beginto see what might be causing a lot of this slowdown.andM;If you are a corporate buyer, you can identify with all of the above.andP;  If youare within the industry, you should try and look at things through a buyer'seyes and then through those of an &quot;average&quot; user.andM;On the Intel side you have to make the following decisions: Which CPU fitsour needs?andP;  Which video system (EGA or VGA)?andP;  What amount of memory?andP;  How biga hard disk?andP;  Which bus architecture system (AT, EISA, or MCA)?andP;  How much doI spend for speed versus performance and how do I know that what the usersare telling me they need is really what they need?andP;  How do I know, as abuyer, that the additional power of an 80386 running at 25 MHz will make anoticeable difference in the output of the user who has requested it?andO;Especially if they have asked for upgrades and gotten them over the course ofthe last two or three years?andM;How, as a buyer, do I weigh all of these factors and make a decision?andP;  Isn'tit easier to give the industry some time to stabilize a little more and adopta wait and see attitude?andM;The end-userandM;If I am an end-user, how do I justify upgrading my machine in terms of harddisk drive and memory to run an operating system which has no robust offeringof software?andP;  How do I feel about spending more money for more and morehardware and software with an industry that has continually promised me moreand more ease of use, more and more function, and not really delivered?andP;  Howlong do I have to wait to get the promises fulfilled, and how much do I haveto spend to get it?andP;  Since my systems now work and permit me to get workdone, doesn't it make more sense to wait for a half or full year and see whatshakes out?andP;  Does it not make economic sense to hold onto what I have and tosee if the industry can get it all together?andM;I would have to say, &quot;Yes.&quot;andP;  Further, this is an industry which delights inoffering many, many choices to users.andP;  How do we expect first time users tomake sense out of what they read and hear?andP;  How do we expect them to comparean Apple Macintosh with a Tandy 1000 with DeskMate, a Compaq 80386 runningDOS 4.01 and its (ugh!!) shell, and an IBM model 70 running OS/2 and verylittle else?andM;Yes, the industry is making strides, and yes, we are getting closer to whatwe have all been wanting.andP;  But pick up any copy of InfoWorld or PC Week andtry and make sense out of what is there.andP;  I do not mean simply the news aboutnew products, I mean the rumors, stories in advance of product announcements,and the speculation of staff writers and industry analysts alike (ourselvesincluded).andP;  How is anyone supposed to make sense out of all of this?andM;Yes, I know, I have said a dozen times, if it will be productive for you andyou can afford it today, buy it today.andP;  Yes, I know that I have said that an80386 based system is &quot;safe&quot; and when configured with a minimum amount ofmemory should not become obsolete for many years.andP;  I also know that manyothers are saying the same thing.andP;  Why, then, are buyers not heeding ourcomments and going out in droves to discover the secrets and promisedincreased productivity of computing?andM;I believe that many, many potential first and second time buyers are afraidof the fast pace that our industry exhibits to the outside world.andP;  I believethat they would rather hesitate for a little longer than to make a jump whichwill cost them time, money, and frustration.andP;  I also believe that many ofthem are still not convinced that they can become productive without havingto become computer literate.andP;  Remember, this new set of users I am talkingabout is the one with members who are willing to become computer capable butnot computer literate.andP;  They will spend just the time and energy to learnwhat they believe they will have to learn to become truly productive.andM;And, a user once burned or discouraged is a hard buyer to re-attract.andP;  Inpart, I have to lay some of the blame on the advertising departments of thevendors as well as their advertising agencies.andP;  Look at the type of ads youguys are putting out.andP;  If I follow the most recent Apple Macintosh ads forexample, I can purchase a system and become a desktop presentation,publishing, spreadsheet, and word processing expert overnight.andP;  This is justnot ture and you all know it.andP;  You still need to learn how to use thecomputer.andP;  You still need to have some skills and be able to figure thingsout.andP;  And, you still need to spend hours learning how to do things.andM;Yes, getting a Macintosh up and running is easy.andP;  Yes, getting a Windowsbased PC up and running is easy (if it has been pre-installed for you).andP;  Butno, it is not easy to figure out how to make things work.andP;  As a case in pointI will now pick on Claris and SmartForm Designer.andP;  I recently decided to useSmartForm Designer to build a new invoice form for our office.andP;  OK, I loadedSmartForm Designer, found a form I could modify in the library, learned howto import an EPS file into it (encapsulated post script-we have our ASCIIlogo in an EPS file) and then made the form &quot;smart&quot; by referring to themanual a few times and by using things I have already learned about theMacintosh.andM;The next step in this process is to save the form and then use SmartFormAssistant to start filling it out.andP;  I saved it as a SmartForm file, loadedsmartForm Assistant and could not, then, read the file.andP;  I tried &quot;Save as&quot;figuring I had to do something to save it in a special format, no luck.andP;  ThenI tried to find some special 'build' or 'output' or 'something' command underany and all of the command bars which would lead me in the right direction.andO;No luck.andM;OK, so then I opened the manual.andP;  I read the table of contents in theSmartForm Designer, searched the index and could find nothing even resembling&quot;saving a form&quot; for use by SmartForm Assistant, exporting, setting up theform for use, saving the form for use etc., etc., etc.andP;  So, I then triedreading the SmartForm Assistant manual, again, nothing.andP;  I wonder if it canbe done?andP;  I will call Claris upon my return from this strip (I am, onceagain, in an airplane) and find out what I am doing wrong.andP;  However,regardless of what it is, I can assure you that it is neither intuitive noreasy to find, yet it is one of the most important operations in the process.andM;Can you imagine buying an SE, running back to your office, setting it up andloading SmartForm Designer?andP;  Spending an hour or two building this reallynice looking form and getting very excited about how good your company isgoing to look on paper, and then find out that you cannot get it importedinto the second part of the program to make use of it?andP;  Bot, back goes thatmachine!andP;  Call me when you think you really have a machine I can use!andM;By the way Apple, since I am picking on you, you interface is good, it iseasy to use, but your developers just do not think anything at all aboutconformity.andP;  Yet, common actions are common, like erasing a file, opening anew one, or getting a file (although I wish that the selection menu bar wouldshow me in gray all of the files on the disk where I am looking, and the oneswhich can be read, in black.andP;  It is really unnerving to pull up an open boxonly to find NO files listed at all and wonder what the heck is going on).andM;Anyway, once I got back to my office I finally found out how to use theSmartForm I had created with SmartForm Assistant.andP;  You just tell the SA thatyou are creating a NEW file from the menu and then select the invoice youhave created with SmartForm Designer.andP;  Boy, that makes sense to me, I alreadyhave  a file so instead of opening it, I do a new.andP;  Of course, in any otherapplication, a 'new' means to start from the very beginning.andP;  I guess thatonce you get used to it, it might make sense, only why do I have to spendseveral hours of my time trying to find out how to do this?andP;  I have beenusing a Macintosh for all six years of its existence and never haveencountered such a requirement.andP;  Am I really dense or is it not intuitive?andM;However, there is hope.andP;  Apple's System 7.0 (see last month's column) isgoint to be great and should arrive this summer.andP;  I have seen some veryinteresting things in the Intel world that would make me go to a graphicaluser interface.andP;  It is almost as if the existing versions of products likeWindows and OS/2 PM were precursors to what end-users will really be able toget.andP;  If some of these products make it out the door before this year is overit might not be such a bad year after all.andP;  One can only hope.andM;A Black Day for AppleandM;While I am on Apple's case, I am going to have to comment about the recentreported resignation of Jean-Louis Gassee.andP;  I will not comment about AllanLoren since I only know of him by reputation and have had no dealings withhim, only word of mount comments about the type of person he was at Apple.andO;Jean-Louis, on the other hand, has always been very accessible to all of theanalysts and has always had time to talk to us (at least to me) about productdevelopments, directions, and the general sense of what computing is and whatit should be.andP;  He has a vision, this man.andP;  He is driven and he has many very,very good ideas.andM;The true politics in this re-organization will probably remain a mysteryuntil someone breaks ranks and writes yet another Silicon Valley novel.andP;  Iwas very upset to hear about Jean-Louis's pending resignation.andP;  He is, to myway of thinking, one of the main reasons Apple has been able to continue tobe innovative.andP;  I do like and respect John Scully but I am very tempted tothink that in his drive to become the Lee Iacocca of the Computer industry hefound that having the Vince Lombardi of the industry as his next in command,or even on his team, somewhat slowed his progress.andP;  Usually two very visibleand intelligent people in a single company splits the media's attention.andM;Again, I do not have anything but respect for John at this point, but I thinkhe make a mistake by letting Jean-Louis go, and, in fact, not putting him incharge after Loren's demise.andP;  Oh, well, I do not run Apple and am not privyto all that has gone on and is now going on, but still, the industry willmiss having Jean-Louis in Cupertino, and I am sure that Apple will feel theloss also.andP;  To Jean-Louis, I wish you success wherever you end up.andP;  BonChance!andM;Apple BashersandM;When a company such as Apple or even IBM starts to make news which is notvery positive, there is a tendency in the trade to get involved in companybashing.andP;  It is always easy to sit on the sidelines and take shots at acompany which is having some trouble as well as to spout forth with all kindsof reasons that the writer sees as the cause of these problems.andP;  I do notbelieve that this kind of reporting is healthy for anyone.andP;  It really onlyserves to make the writer feel as if he or she knows how to cure the ills ofa company that he or she is not directly involved with.andM;Recent articles regarding Apple's problems have mentioned John Scully ashaving made more than his share of management mistakes, others have said he'snot paying attention to the company and its direction, and on and on.andP;  Iwould like to make a few comments myself, not about people specifically, butabout the dilemma that Apple has to be dealing with.andP;  I am not offeringsolutions, but only a glimpse of an area in which I see Apple's weakness anda hope that there is a product on the drawing board to bridge this gap.andM;The Apple II product line was the main reason Apple was able to achieve thegrowth level they had early on.andP;  The introduction of the Apple III system didnot help them, nor did the Lisa.andP;  In fact, the Lisa was a machine before itstime.andP;  Apple, however, stuck it out and got it right.andP;  Not that the firstMacintosh products were &quot;right,&quot; but they were the start of what has now cometo be regarded as one of the easiest computers to use and one that sets thestandards that all of the other companies are aiming for.andP;  Apple has donewell in its quest to penetrate the business market, and I believe that maybethe next batch of products out of the chute will help them gain furtherground in this marketplace.andM;While they were busy getting product into the mainstream of corporations,IBM, Tandy, and others were starting to pay attention to the educationmarket, a stronghold for the Apple II products.andP;  Apple failed to shore up itsproduct offerings in this area, primarily due to the lack of a local areanetwork product as educational institutions moved from computer labs towardscomputerized classrooms which are networked.andM;What Apple did do, however, was to start a standardization between optionsthat are add-ons to both the Apple II and Macintosh product lines.andP;  What theyneed to do now is to solve the &quot;cross-over&quot; product problem which willsatisfy the existing Apple II user base and yet provide a growth direction onthe low-end for the Macintosh.andM;If you take a look at the Macintosh product offerings, it is very evidentthat there is a gaping hole in the $1,500 to $2,500 list price category.andO;This is the area in which the competition is placing lots and lots ofsystems.andP;  You will notice that I mentioned list prices.andP;  This puts theeducational price of the product squarely into the $1000 price range which iswhere it needs to be.andM;But, the Macintosh Plus does not compete in this area because it is not anopen machine and does not support color, nor does it run Apple II software.andM;But what if Apple were to include an Apple II compatible chip in a low endMacintosh, along with the Macintosh guts?andP;  Next, of course, you would buildthis Macintosh as an open system with slots.andP;  Maybe you would put color videoon the motherboard, or maybe you would make it available inexpensively as anoption.andP;  In any event, what you would end up with is a low-end Macintoshwhich would also run Apple II software and would be priced so as to attractthe home and educational buyers.andP;  Networking, while an issue, can be solvedin several different ways (See below).andM;Of course, the problem that Apple has with introducing this type of machineis the same one that IBM and others had to wrestle with: How do you build andsell such a product without impacting your high-end business products?andP;  IBMhad to do a lot of soul searching in order to release the Model 25 system.andO;They did spend many along hours and sleepless nights trying to find a way toget the product to market without hurting the sales of their other products.andO;Maybe, you just have to m ake it the best you can and assume that it willimpact some of your higher end-sales but that it will also bring non-Applebuyers into the fold in enough numbers so as to make up for the loss thehigher priced units.andM;Anyway, I believe that this box is needed in Apple's product line and Ibelieve that the issue of networks can be handled in several different ways.andO;First, of course, if the new box is designed to run System 7.0 software (seelast month's column) it will already include many of the features that are inother networks.andP;  It will not be a fully functional network for education, butit will permit file sharing and device sharing.andP;  It will, however, form abasis from which other vendors can work.andP;  The new DayneNet network products,for example, could be easily adapted to work with this new box.andP;  I reallylike the Dayna approach and the price point of the product makes itcompetitive with others in the educational marketplace.andP;  Dayna's entireproduct is built on Novell's operating system and can run over LocalTalk aswell as Ethernet and it can mix and match these two networks, an idealsituation for a school complex where classroom wiring could be LocalTalk andthe backbone could be done in Ethernet.andM;I also believe that many other companies would rally around this new productfor networking products.andP;  Also, many of the educational software developerswould be willing to port their products over to a networked system of AppleIIs and Macintoshes.andP;  After all, they are always looking for a way toincrease their own revenues and if they see a concerted effort in theeducational market by Apple they will jump on the opportunity.andM;Schools, for the most part, have not been into mixing and matching differenttypes of computers.andP;  Who can blame them?andP;  Every time we do this in thecorporate world we have to solve problems over and over again.andP;  Courseware isdesgiend to run on a single platform and the general rule of thumb is that ifit runs on Apples you stay with Apples, if it runs on IBMs and the clonesthen you pick and choose the best possible deal you can on the hardware andthe network.andP;  I do not believe that it would take much for Apple, with aDaynaNet connection, to be able to tap into existing IBM educational networksand convince the software vendors to write software which runs on bothplatforms.andP;  Again, all of these observations are made as an outsider,obviously, and are not based on any internal Apple information or advancedlooks at what they are doing in this regard, but rather on sitting back andlooking at the problem from this vantage point.andM;I hope that Apple will get back into the home and educational market with abang.andP;  there is a need for them to be in this market and as the &quot;new&quot; homemarket starts to heat up it is important for them to play in it.andP;  One of thethings that strikes me is the number of people who hear about what is goingon at Apple and just shake their heads.andP;  Apple, after all, is one of thoserare companies that we can all identify with.andP;  They have been able to blend asub-culture with a serious business environment and make it work.andP;  I hopethat it continues.andM;On to other things....andM;Last months column about Radio frequency usage for local area networks, aswell as the mention of it in my MIS week column, touched off some realsparks.andP;  The ink had not even dried on the MIS week piece when my phone beganto ring off the wall.andP;  However, most of the questions raised had to do withthe confusion over the recent IBM/Motorola new company and RF modem deal(ARDIS) and the comments I had made.andP;  It is easy to get confused for sure.andO;The entire radio spectrum above 800 MHz contains many different types ofradio service.andP;  This is the area where cellular telephone services are, wheremore and more police and fire departments communicate, where severaldifferent types of private shared radio systems exist, including trunkedradio, shared interconnect system, repeaters with dispatch services, the newARDIS system, and the new segment allocated for just about anything for useby anyone without a license requirement.andP;  It is in this last section of thefrequency spectrum that the in-house local area network systems will operate.andO;The ARDIS system users will be using a totally different segment of the samebasic frequency band and will have to be licensed.andM;I hope that this information, as well as that contained in my ARDIS story,will help to clarify the situation.andP;  It does get most confusing when peoplesimply refer to the 800 MHz band, and do not realize that there are many,many different services operating in this portion of the spectrum.andM;TravelingandM;Once again I am on the road.andP;  Nothing new about that except that this time Iam headed for Houston for the Toshiba Challenge, a product introduction inthe backyard of Compaq.andP;  I feel strange heading for a Toshiba announcementand sitting here typing this column on my Compaq LTE/286.andP;  However, at themoment, this is my machine of choice.andP;  I do wish I had received the 40MB harddrive with this unit, but I have really become addicted to using it.andP;  I findthat I am using it not only on these trips but also in my day-to-dayactivities as well.andP;  I have installed IBM's Current on it and trasfer all ofmy scheduling files onto it when I leave the office each day.andP;  The 386 systemthat I have at home is gathering dust because I use this little one at home,plugged into a bigger monitor.andP;  It saves having my files on three separatemachines, and since I carry the LTE with me, I always have most of my fileswith me.andM;The batteries last longer than Compaq claims in the specifications, but Istill carry two with me.andP;  You never know when one will give up the ghost andhaving the other one along insures that I will have enough battery for almostany length of trip.andP;  Now I need to get another battery charger.andP;  The one Ihave only charges batteries in the computer so I have to change the batteryeach night while I am at the hotel.andM;Mark Eppley made available a new box that Traveling Software sells.andP;  I willget a chance to use it on this trip.andP;  It is small enough that it fits into mybriefcase along with my spare battery and laptop phone kit, and it looks likeit should solve most of my telephone interconnect problems.andP;  What is thisthing?andP;  It is called the MO fone and it plugs into a telephone in a differentway than most such interface devices.andP;  Instead of havvng to find an RJ-11wall jack, or taking the phone apart, the MO fone plugs into the unit betweenthe handset and the handset jack on a standard phone (this means that it willnot work with a pay telephone).andP;  This little box has a number of switches andconnectors on it.andP;  It addition to the handset plug and cable to plug into thephone, there is a standard RJ-11 jack to connect it to your computer modem.andO;The three switches are labelled Voice-Data, D, E, and C, and polarity.andM;If you follow the easy to use directions you are instructed to unplug thehandset, plug the MO FONE into the handset jack on the phone and the handsetinto the MO FONE jack marked Handset.andP;  You set the D-E-C switch to E and younow can use your hotel room phone just as you normally would.andP;  The Polarityswitch is only used when you first hook up the phone, and only for carbontype microphones (most hotel phones and most older types of home phones).andO;You then listen to the dialtone in the DATA mode and change the polarityswitch to the position in which the tone is the loudest.andM;The switch marked D, E, C is for choosing the proper type of interface forthe phone you are using.andP;  The instructions give a listing for 17 differenttypes of phones and the proper switch settings for each.andP;  In addition, theytell you how to decide which position to try for phones not listed (I thinkwe will add these switch settings to our Hotel Data Base on the bulletinboards).andM;The next set of instructions furnished with the unit go through a typicaldialing sequence from your computer and should be very easy to follow.andP;  Ifenough of these gadgets find their way into use, I hope that some of themodern software packages will fully support it.andP;  For now you have to set upthe software just to the point of autodialing, and either autodial or dialthe number from your phone (a combination of this also works so that you candial any access numbers specific to the hotel on your regular telephone andthen have the computer autodial the balance of the number).andM;If the phone handset is hardwired, the gadget even comes with a clip adapterand instructions for taking the telephone apart and making the devicefunction in this manner.andP;  The price for this handy MO FONE is $99.00 and isavailable from Traveling Software.andP;  Telephone order number is 1-800-343-8080.andO;The device is actually made by some folks in San Diego, CA, and theirtelephone number and address are furnished in the instructions for technicalassistance.andP;  I have added this gadget to my CP+ Road Warrior pack (See Vol.andO;8, No.andP;  1) and now think that i am set for almost every type of telephone wemight encounter.andP;  Thanks, Mark!andM;Actually, I did use this device in my hotel in Houston.andP;  It was simple toinstall and even easier to configure and get to work.andM;I plugged it in according to the directions, set up Mirror to make a call toMCI mail by dialing the 1-800 number, reached over to the phone and dialed 9for access, and then had the computer dial the rest of the number.andP;  What Ifound was that it is easier to let the computeandless; dial the number once beforegoing off hook, pressing ESC, and then typing GO at the command line (thisworks with CrossTalk also).andP;  Once I dialed the '9' on the house phone, Imerely pressed the Enter key and the computer dailed into MCI for me.andP;  Onceconnected, with the switch in the DATA mode I was able to send and receivedata without a hitch.andP;  Not only that, but since the Four Seasons Inn at thePark in Houston does have RJ-11 jacks I tried it both ways.andP;  Sending dataworked better with the MO FONE--no errors, and my phone worked all of thetime for my regular voice uses.andM;Speaking of TelephonesandM;As any of you who has dailed into our BBS system lately (408-737-7862) know,we have changed the software to that made by Mustang Software (Wild-cat).andO;This is a great package and we have had a lot of help from Chuck Metz andRick Dexter in setting it up.andP;  We have made a lot of progress and plan to addmore and more functions all the time.andP;  Through the generosity of Jim Buttonof Button Software, we have been added to the shareware BBS list and aregetting tons of really great software in house.andP;  It is somewhat timeconsuming to check it all for viruses and put it up on the system, but we areadding it as fast as we can.andP;  Please bear with us and I know that you willfind what we are doing is beneficial.andP;  We already have a lot of the sharewarestuff up and running.andM;SharewareandM;I have become a big supporter of shareware lately.andP;  I have tried a number ofthe packages that we have received and find that everything from very simpleutilities to full-blown programs are very useful.andP;  I would like to ask thateach of you that downloads any of this shareware and plans to make use of itsends in the fee requested by the author.andP;  This money is NOT to be sent tous, but directly to the person or company listed with each package.andP;  Thesepeople have spent a great deal of time and effort developing these packages,so if you use them, please pay for them.andM;One of the reasons that I like shareware so much is that it is a great way tofind out if a specific program will function for you and do what you needdone before you have to pay for it.andP;  With the high price of software and thelarge selection available, this makes things nice.andP;  I have a decidedadvantage over you in that I get most of the commercial software sent to meand get to review it to see if it does what it says it will.andP;  However, layingout several hundred dollars for a package only to find out that it fallsshort of your expectations is not a pleasant experience.andP;  Several years ago,I saw a survey where people were asked how many packages they had purchasedbefore selecting the one that they presently used.andP;  It seems to me that theaverage response was something like 2.1 packages.andP;  That's a lot of money tohave sitting on shelves and not getting used.andP;  Maybe some of the big vendorsshould release preview packages into the Shareware channels and provideinformation on how to get the shrink-wrapped package once a user has had timeto llok at it and see that it meets his needs...just a thought.andM;Next MonthandM;Next month I hope to be able to talk about some of the really great newsoftware we have in house, and hopefully Dayna will deliver DaynaNet to me sothat I can get it up and running also.andP;  As usual, there are a hundred thingsI have not written about.andP;  Scads of software and hardware products arewaiting for one of us to get to them.andP;  And many industry happenings have beenleft out.andP;  Still, I hope that what I do have time to look at and comment onis beneficial to you.andP;  If there is something specific you would like me tolook at or write about, please contact us at the numbers listed on themasthead.andP;  I try and log onto the BBS system every day and answer all of mymail.andP;  I do log onto MCI everyday and not as often on AppleLink, IBMLink,Compuserve and Prodigy, but I do get on often enough to be able to respond toyour comments and questions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
