Sitting on a bench in his back yard, Mr. Bell surveysElmwood, a picturesque tobacco and livestock farm that looksas if it came off the set of &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; His houseis a fine old Kentucky home: a stately mansion, circa 1820,of red brick adorned with tall white columns. Black anguscattle graze out front, eating Kentucky bluegrass. Theproperty of orchards, fields and hilly countryside stretchesas far as the eye can see.</LP><TEXT>   But beyond the far hillside, one mile away, a dynamiteblast disrupts Mr. Bell's serenity and cracks his windowpanes. There, Toyota Motor Corp. assembles its popular Camrysedan. It is a world of seemingly endless blacktop andbuildings, and it is growing ever larger: The blasting is tomake way for a doubling of plant production by 1993.   &quot;People worry that we're becoming a Toyota town,&quot; says thesoft-spoken Mr. Bell. &quot;Their presence affects so many thingsyou couldn't have predicted.&quot;   Toyota's influence in this conservative Southern townextends far beyond its sprawling, 4,000-employee plant. Cityand county officials zip around town in Camrys donated byToyota. The local high school sends all seventh- andtenth-grade classes on field trips to the plant. Townsfolkgather at the Cardome community center, a historic mansionthat Toyota donated $1 million to renovate, while teenagerscongregate at the Center of Town, a hangout Toyota alsohelped restore.   For all the good will that Toyota has tried to engender,though, its actions have stirred deep resentment in manypeople. Residents fear that Georgetown, population 12,910,where thoroughbreds gallop behind plank fences and oaks shadeGreek Revival homes, is losing its small-town identity. Jobsand new prosperity have brought bitter debates overdevelopment. And farmers have seen their political powerovershadowed by new players: the Japanese and Americanmanagement at the plant.   But some townsfolk, it turns out, were also a bit naive.They wanted the benefits that Toyota would provide, butdidn't want anything to disrupt their traditional life.What's more, some residents criticize Toyota for bringing toomuch growth, while their neighbors assail it for not bringingenough.   &quot;Toyota is definitely molding that little town,&quot; saysRichard Florida, a professor at Carnegie Mellon Universitywho has studied the auto maker. &quot;It's very important toJapanese companies to create a family, to align companyinterests with community interests. They're trying to createa whole social environment that reinforces the company'svalues. The question is, `Can you do that in America?'&quot;   The answer to that question, no doubt, is yes, forcompanies have created company towns in the U.S. forgenerations. But Toyota isn't just another company: It's aJapanese one. Besides demonstrating how a big corporation candramatically change a small rural community, Georgetown'sstory highlights the deep-seated suspicions, both historicaland economic, that many Americans still harbor for theJapanese.   During the last few years, Japanese companies have built ahuge industrial network in six Midwestern states -- Ohio,Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee --creating some 100,000 manufacturing jobs. Whether auto,steel, chemical or tire manufacturers, the companies chose tosettle in middle America. They wanted to steer clear of bigcities and their often-fractious unions; some also sought toavoid minority labor pools, though Toyota has recruited manyminorities for its plant. Generally, though, the companiesfigured they could cultivate more support in isolated, ruralcommunities.   The Japanese presence, however, has in some casesunleashed a backlash. In Lafayette, Ind., where Subaru andIsuzu jointly operate an auto plant, residents staged angryprotests when the city council renamed a street after thetown's sister city in Japan. The street in question fronted acity park commemorating World War II veterans. The councilwas forced to reverse its decision, changing &quot;Ota City Drive&quot;back to &quot;Cherokee Drive.&quot;   No one has taken to the streets in Georgetown, whereToyota has assembled cars since 1988, but talk on Main Streetoften turns angry. &quot;Toyota will take this town and never firea weapon,&quot; says Carl Mitchell, a lifelong resident. &quot;Whateverthey want, they get.&quot;   Toyota officials say they aren't engaging in socialengineering. Still, acknowledges James Wiseman, a Toyotaspokesman, &quot;image is important.&quot; The auto maker conductsregular polls to keep track of local sentiment. It takes outads extolling itself as a good neighbor. Notably, most of thecompany's contact with the town takes place through Americanmanagers it has hired, such as Mr. Wiseman and Alex M.Warren, a senior vice president. And it is often the Americanmanagement that comes up with the strategies Toyota uses toingratiate itself.   Georgetown has become a mecca for job seekers across thisdepressed state, which collects roughly $20 million fromToyota in taxes each year. &quot;Toyota has brought new vigor tothis region,&quot; says Frank Shoop, owner of a new autodealership on Cherry Blossom Way, the four-lane highwayleading to the Toyota plant. &quot;People in Kentucky viewGeorgetown as the land of milk and honey.&quot;   Locals felt the same way at first. When former Gov. MarthaLayne Collins helicoptered into town on Dec. 12, 1985, toannounce that Toyota had chosen Georgetown as its U.S.manufacturing site, there was euphoria. Signs in windowsproclaimed, &quot;Oh, what a feeling]&quot;   But the mood darkened when Kentuckians learned that Gov.Collins had given Toyota incentives totaling $140 million,mainly for worker training, purchase of the 1,600-acre plantsite and improvements there. Other car makers have been wooedto the region with similar incentives, including GeneralMotors Corp. with its Saturn project. But the huge size ofthe Toyota package caught people off-guard. And townofficials also worried that the deal didn't provide forincreased revenue to offset the services they would have toprovide.   Against this backdrop, the city council appointed a newmayor, Tom Prather, a former car dealer who quickly forged arelationship with Toyota's Mr. Warren. The two were soonmeeting weekly for long breakfast talks. The meetings yieldedsignificant concessions for the town. Toyota, which says itstotal investment in the auto plant is approaching $2 billion,agreed to be annexed by Georgetown and let the town collectpayroll and other taxes. They will net the city about $1.5million this year, almost a quarter of its budget.   Toyota's largess didn't stop there. It agreed to pay theScott County school system more than $15 million over 20years. And at the dedication of the plant in 1988, Fujio Cho,Toyota's top ranking executive in Georgetown, presented themayor with 10 new white Camrys. The company has also madegrants to a horse race track, a childrens' museum, anorchestra and a variety of social welfare groups. &quot;When weneed something, we call the Japanese and they provide it.It's not healthy,&quot; frets Stanley Duttenhofer, a merchant.   The town's annual budget has tripled in six years, to $6.7million. The previous mayor was a part-timer who was paid$7,200 a year and drove a school bus on the side; MayorPrather earns $40,400. The police department has swelled to29 people from 16, despite almost no increase in crime. Allofficers have their own police vehicles now, and theirfirepower has been upgraded to 14-shot semiautomatics. &quot;Weseem to be searching for ways to spend money,&quot; complains ClayMcKnight, a county attorney.   There have also been trips to Japan for the mayor andother city officials, with Toyota paying for accommodations.School Superintendent John Herlihy Jr. has gone twice, andsays Toyota also includes him in its major functions. &quot;Theysaid, `You're important. You need to be there,'&quot; he says.&quot;All I ever heard from U.S. businessmen is that we didn't doour job.&quot;   The company has bought materials for the high school andsupports vocational training for dropouts. Just its presencehas an effect on academic life: At the Scott County HighSchool north of town, students study Japanese. &quot;I figured Imight have to work for a Japanese company someday,&quot; saysJustin Holmes, a student with shaggy blond hair.   Toyota says it worries about having too much influenceover Georgetown, and tries to police itself. Its philanthropyis decided by a special committee and there's a policyagainst political donations. &quot;We don't want Georgetown to bea company town,&quot; says Mr. Warren. &quot;We don't want to dominatethis city.&quot;   Dominate or not, change has certainly been coming to thisgenteel, heavily Baptist community. Georgetown is a placewith 46 churches, one for every 280 people, and is in a drycounty. But now it also has the &quot;Osaka Health Spa,&quot; marked bya red neon sign on a rundown building a block behind cityhall. It's reputed to be a massage parlor, though no oneseems to know who runs it and its clientele is American, notJapanese. The county has tried unsuccessfully to shut itdown.   Another small sign of the changes since Toyota opened:Grocery stores now have Japanese food sections, with tempurabatter mix and baked bean curd cakes.   Most of the 170 or so Japanese who work at Toyota, as wellas the top American managers, live in urban Lexington 15miles to the south. Mr. Cho, however, lives in Georgetown.Kaoru Fujioka, wife of another Toyota manager who lives inthe small town, says that &quot;it's difficult to make contact&quot;with local residents. &quot;At first everybody was kind, but maybethey think I have a big problem with English. Sometimes Ithink some people don't like me.&quot;   But it's the industrial sprawl across the countryside thatconcerns many. &quot;What will happen to the bluegrass isquestionable,&quot; says Mary Wharton, a retired biologyprofessor. &quot;This area prides itself as the horse capital ofthe world, but in 15 years it probably won't be.&quot;   Toyota says it abides by all environmental regulations.But the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this monthfor the first time cited Scott County for failing clean-airstandards, largely because of auto-plant emissions. Andbecause the plant rests on porous limestone, there's concernthat treated industrial wastes it discharges into streamscould affect the ground water that feeds the bluegrass.   New wealth has disrupted what was once a simple place.Some land values quadrupled almost overnight, as speculatorsfrom as far away as Texas and Florida snapped up options todevelop parcels. &quot;The piranhas descended upon us,&quot; says MarkSmith, a local developer.   Infighting over land -- what to do with it and how to getit -- has pitted neighbor against neighbor and even splitfamilies. Consider the Price clan, which was dividedfour-to-one over selling most of its 1,175 acres of farm landto Toyota. The holdout was the family patriarch, Milton&quot;Shorty&quot; Price, who fought the Japanese in the South Pacific,losing the sight in one eye. &quot;He didn't want them here and Idon't blame him,&quot; says his wife, Louise, speaking for herpartly paralyzed husband. He was overruled. &quot;I hope thosethistles grow back again, up through the concrete&quot; of theformer farm land sold to Toyota, his wife says.   For local merchants, Toyota's arrival and the prosperityand higher property values it brought has meant higher rentsand new competition. Loraine Cannon, the owner of Flair, adowntown clothing store, says her rent has more than doubledto $450 a month, while a new outlet mall nearby sells&quot;cheaper at retail than I can buy at wholesale.&quot; Her store, afixture on Main Street for 16 years, will close at year end.&quot;I can't recall a single Toyota customer that has shoppedhere,&quot; she says.   At the same time, some developers are angry that propertyvalues haven't risen enough. Lots of housing was built, buthomes sat unsold because people didn't move to Scott Countyin the numbers predicted. Instead, 80% of the 4,000 Toyotaworkers live outside the county. Zoning restrictions alsohampered development.   &quot;People call it the boom that wasn't,&quot; says StephenMooney, a planning consultant who quit after citizensdisagreed on how the community should grow.   Dozens of public hearings were held as a struggle eruptedbetween farming advocates who wanted to limit growth andprogrowth industrialists who supported Toyota. It has beenfurious and frequent: over whether to establish agriculturalbuffer zones to control growth; over whether to merge countyand town governments; over whether to build a new interstatehighway encircling Georgetown to relieve congestion.   &quot;Toyota is not the villain, but it was the catalyst for alot of these problems,&quot; says Kay Bell, Cecil Bell's wife, whosits on the planning commission. Though Mrs. Bell says sheisn't nostalgic for the quiet days before Toyota, she muses:&quot;It would be nice if there weren't as much fractionalism asthere is now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
