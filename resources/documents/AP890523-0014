Judge Stephen F. Eilperin has promised a ruling today onAlabama's bid to extradite the 17-year-old, identified only by theinitials O.M. The youth is charged with arson and murder in the May1988 firebombing of a Gadsden, Ala., apartment that killed14-month-old Tamel Jackson.   Regardless of how he rules, Eilperin has promised to stay hisorder until next week to give the losing side a chance to challengethe decision before the D.C. Court of Appeals.   The youth's attorney, Gerald Fisher, argued at a hearing Mondaythat the district must apply legislation passed by the City Counciloutlawing the death penalty to the interstate agreement governingjuvenile extraditions.   But Paul Alper, assistant corporation counsel for the districtgovernment, said the council's ban on capital punishment did notchange the city's obligation to enforce the interstate agreement.   Eilperin said a ``major problem'' with the defense argument wasthat O.M. is not threatened by the death penalty if he is tried asa juvenile. And if Alabama decides to try the boy as an adult,Eilperin said, he would be obligated under the Constitution toapprove the extradition, regardless of the ban on capitalpunishment.   But Fisher said Alabama authorities cannot certify O.M. fortrial as an adult, which would subject him to a possible deathsentence, unless he first is returned to the state.   O.M. has been fighting extradition since he was arrested bydistrict authorities in December. His uncle, Yul Devoe Guice, 31,was arrested by Alabama authorities soon after the bombing andcharged with murder and arson.   The boy's grandmother, Alice Guice Thomas, testified at ahearing last month that O.M., who is black, cannot get a fair trialfrom the white authorities of Etowah County, Ala., because thecounty's law enforcement officials have a longstanding vendettaagainst her family.   But Alper argued that the fairness of the Alabama judicialsystem was not at issue in the case. He said district officials``would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in Alabamaattempted to pass judgment on our system of justice.''   Alper also contended that if the district refused to enforce theinterstate agreement on juvenile extraditions in this case, thenation's capital would quickly turn into ``a haven for fleeingfugitives.''</TEXT></DOC>
