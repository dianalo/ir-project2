The line shapes of bothsystems became increasingly anisotropic as the temperature was lowered.The cyclooctatetraene rings in uranocene were found to be rotating ata frequency greater than 100 kHz down to 90 K. The (C{sub 5}H{sub 5}){sub3}UCl molecules were found to be reorienting rapidly above 220 K, butbelow 140 K the NMR spectra were characteristic of a rigid lattice withno rotation of the cyclopentadienyl rings. The spectra of both compoundscould be simulated by assuming an axial paramagnetic shift tensor andan orientation-dependent line width. Comparison of the experimental shifttensor with that calculated for a point dipolar interaction revealeda large and very anisotropic paramagnetic shift for uranocene due tounpaired spin transferred into the ligand orbitals. The shift was largewhen the magnetic field was along the 8-fold symmetry axis of the moleculeand nearly zero perpendicular to the axis. It appears conclusive thatthe contact shift in uranocene is not isotropic at all. A similar anisotropyin the contact shift associated with the cyclopentadienyl rings is evidentalso in the results for (C{sub 5}H{sub 5})UCl. The average solid-stateshift of uranocene agreed with the solution shift, within experimentalerror, but the solid state shift of (C{sub 5}H{sub 5}){sub 3}UCl was42 ppm greater than the solution shift at 298 K, indicating a differencein molecular geometry between the crystalline state and solution. 32references, 8 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
