Theredevelopment of the wharf area no longer makes it possible to launch recreationalboats from the wharf. In addition, routine docking space is no longer availableas the wharf serves as the normal moorings for a number of commercial passengervessels. Overlaying this area is an existing regulatory restriction previouslyenacted due to the narrow channel, numerous bridges, and a sharp bend inthe river. Recreational boaters add to the congestion and increase therisk and likelihood of a marine casualty because they feel they can transitthe canal area and turn around without violating the current regulation.The impact of the proposed action will be to further clarify the existingregulation allowing passage through the McAlpine Lock but precluding entranceof recreational boaters no intending to transit the lock. It will reducecongestion and the risk of a marine casualty in this constricted passageway.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before September 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be mailed to Commanding Officer, U.S.Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, Room 360, 600 Martin Luther King Jr.Place, Louisville, Kentucky 40202-2230.

Suire, Project Attorney, SecondCoast Guard District, 1430 Olive Street, St. Louis, Missouri, 63103-2398.<T3>Discussion of Proposed Regulations: </T3>As a result of the redevelopmentof the Louisville, Kentucky wharf it is no longer possible to launch recreationalboats in the area. There is no longer sufficient space available for recreationalboaters to dock at the wharf on a routine basis since this is the normalmoorings for a number of commercial passenger vessels, including the ``ZacharyTaylor II'', The ``Belle of Louisville'' support barge. This area is alreadya restricted area, 33 CFR 62.100, for approaching tows and large commercialvessels due to the narrow channel, numerous bridges, and a sharp bend inthe river. Some recreational boater as are of the opinion that they cantransit the canal and turn around therein. This adds to the congestionand increases the likelihood of a marine casualty. The existing regulationstates, in part, that it applies to ``passage through the Louisville andPortland Canal.'' The intent was to allow passage through the McAlpineLock, whereas interpretation of the current wording has added to the alreadyserious congestion. This proposal will clarify the original intent of theexisting regulation and it will remove the exception for launching anddocking of pleasure of fishing craft within the restricted area or at theLouisville Kentucky wharf.<T3>Economic Assessment and Certification: </T3>The proposed regulationsare considered to be non-major under Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulationand nonsignificant under Department of Transportation policies and procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this proposalis expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.The change will merely extend the restricted area to include recreationalboaters since the operation of commercial vessels and large tows are alreadyaddressed within the existing regulations. By including recreational boatersin the regulation, congestion and the likelihood of marine casualty willbe lessened, thus potentially saving lives and property, and allowing morevessels to transit the area efficiently and safely.Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the CoastGuard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 162</ITAG>Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Security measures, Vessels,Waterways.<T3>Proposed Regulations: </T3>In consideration of the foregoing, the CoastGuard proposes to amend Part 162 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulationsas follows;1.
