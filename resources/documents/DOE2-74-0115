<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0115 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report contains information on the coastal breeding distributionand abundance in the contiguous United States of 56 species (and theGreat White Heron, now considered a subspecies of the Great Blue Heron)of colonially nesting waterbirds in the orders Procellariiformes, Pelecaniformes,Ciconiiformes, and Charadriiformes. The primary source of populationdata was a series of regional atlases of coastal waterbird colonies published(or being published) by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in its formerFWS/OBS series, now renamed the Biological Report series. Other datawere gleaned from the literature and from survey results published byother federal, state, and private organizations and individuals. In manyinstances the summaries presented here constitute the first attempt toprovide a nationwide overview of the coastal breeding populations ofsome of these species. We also have provided a general review of thenesting habitat use and have tried to indicate, where appropriate, geographicalvariation in habitat choice or use by each species. For each speciesdiscussed, this report contains a map showing the abundance of the speciesin the US Fish and Wildlife Service's 1:250,000-scale coastal map regions.For all but five of the species, it contains a population summary tableand a colony-size frequency distribution table. For each state and coastalmap region, the tables provide the estimated number of nesting birdsand the number of colony sites censused. Mean colony size and colony-sizefrequency data are also provided on a state-by-state basis.</TEXT></DOC>
