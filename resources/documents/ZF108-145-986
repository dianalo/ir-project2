D. Hirsch and other educators who want to shiftemphasis from acquiring skills to learning facts.andP;  He says children are notvessels into which you pyour facts; they actively construct knowledge andmodels of the world.andP;  Kids learn by doing, and educational software shouldlet them build and run models.andP;  He have several examples of projects whichfill the bill: the Geometry Tutor developed at Carnegie Mellon; Thinker Toolsfrom Bolt, Beranek, and Newman; and Boxer from UC Berkeley.andM;Soloway likes these programs because they provide multiple, linkedrepresentations of the same phenomena.andP;  For example, with Thinker Tools, aphysics simulation is shown as data points and as animated objects.andP;  He alsodescribed Kid's Net, a nationwide project in which kids are gatheringacid-rain data and sending it to a central location for analysis.andP;  Solowaylikes systems in which kids to things.andP;  He likes shop classes.andP;  He likessynthesis.andM;Programming, like a shop class, involves doing and synthesis, and Soloway hasbeen working on tools for teaching programming in high school.andP;  He is workingon a multirepresentational environment for program editing in which studentsfocus on modular design and synthesis, not code.andP;  Code appears in one window,as with a conventional editor, but other windows show other representationsof an evolving program--goals, plans, procedure libraries, a procedurehierarchy diagram, and so forth.andP;  He wishes to shift the focus from the codeto the design.andP;  He is working toward a design editor as opposed to a programeditor.andP;  A design editor reifies the design, and Soloway's students talkexplicity about goals and design alternatives, as well as the code.andM;Pamela Samuelson, visiting professor of law at Emory University in Atlanta,organized a plenary debate on &quot;Protecting User Interfaces Through Copyright.&quot;andO;The debate format was a mock trial pitting Jack E. Brown, the lead attorneyin Apple's look-and-feel copyright suit with Microsoft, against Thomas M.S.andO;Hemmes, who represents Mosaic software, a defendant in a Lotus 123look-and-feel case.andP;  I was struck by the extent to which they spoke ofeconomic issues like encouragement of innovation and ease of capitalformation rather than strictly legal issues.andP;  There was no winner or loser inthe debate, but comments and questions from the audience seemed slantedagainst Apple's attempt to seek protection, perhaps because they believed theMacintosh interface derived from work at Xerox.andP;  The audience cheered whensomeone asked whether copyright law allowed company &quot;A&quot; to seek protectionagainst someone copying an interface they had copied from company &quot;X.&quot;andM;Samuelson confirmed my impression by conducting a written survey of the CHI'89 audience.andP;  The vast majority felt the protection of commands andlook-and-feel was inappropriate.andP;  These were not the views of ivory-toweridealists--the majority of the respondents were working on commercialproducts.andP;  Samuelson concludes that the CHI community strongly opposesprotection, stating that no one would have believed the survey results hadthey been more one-sided.andP;  Samuelson is a law professor but is not afraid totake lawyers to task.andP;  She feels that many in the legal community assume thatprotection of intellectual property is good and fosters innovation.andP;  Sincethe people at CHI are the ones who are supposed to be motivated byprotection, she seriously questions that assumption.andM;Samuelson is hopeful these survey results can influence legal thinking.andP;  Theymay be considered by the judge in the suit between Lotus and PaperbackSoftware, and she will also present them to a National Research Councilworkshop on Intellectual Property Challenges in Software.andP;  This workshop maybe influential in formulating new law for software.andM;Personal computing has seen a recent rash of lawsuits.andP;  Tandy filed a suitclaiming that Toshiba violated a patent on portable-computer design in whicha hinged display folds over the keyboard.andP;  (My understanding is that a patenthas to be on something non-obvious--maybe some piano company has that patentnailed down).andP;  Information International filed suits against Adobe and Apple,claiming that the outline fonts in the PostScript page-description languageinfringe on their patent on conversion of character outlines to bitmaps.andO;Refac Inc. is claiming royalties on all spreadsheet programs due to a patenton the algorithm for determining cell-evaluation order.andP;  With the advent ofmultimedia products, we may also see suits over the rights to images, music,and data.andM;These attempts at legal protection have engendered protest.andP;  The FreeSoftware Federation, including MIT's Marvin Minsky, an ACM Turing Awardwinner, has picketed Lotus for suing competitors over the look and feel of123, and anonymous persons at Apple have publicly distributed parts of theMacintosh operating system source code in retaliation for Apple's litigation.andM;Both debaters at CHI '89 made reasonable points, and a simple satisfactoryanswer for all is impossible.andP;  I hope designers continue to do the best workthey can, without undue attention to legal challenges.andP;  Standard interfacesare good for users, and Lotus has protection for their investment in 123without protecting its look and feel.andP;  Lawsuits get attention, but they arisein a miniscule fraction of all products.andP;  The legal system or a license cansettle the few conflicts that do arise.andM;Paper and Panel SessionsandM;Nearly all of the papers and panel sessions related to personal computing.andO;The following are some that caught my eye.andM;Drama and Personality in InterfaceandM;Design.andP;  Much of this panel session centered around anthropomorphic agentsand characters.andP;  Perhaps the strongest pro-agent position was made by BrendaLaurel, who feels that agent personality will convey useful information inshaping interaction with programs.andP;  She also argued that interface designerscan learn useful lessons from dramatists.andP;  As she acknowledged, however,there is controversy regarding agents.andP;  Some feel that they are silly (realprogrammers type command lines) or misleading.andP;  For example, KnowledgeNavigator, an Apple video tape of an imaginary system of the future, wascriticized as being misleading because it promised too much.andP;  Among otherthings, it depicts a jaunty, command-interpreting agent--sort of aCOMMAND.COM with a bow tie.andM;Bat Brushes.andP;  What is a &quot;bat?&quot;andP;  It is a flying mouse.andP;  Colin Ware and CurtisBaxter have experiemented with a 3Space Isotrac, an input device manufacturedby MacDonald Douglas that encodes six-hand position and orientationparameters: x, y, and z coordinates; roll; azimuth; and elevation (see Figure1).andP;  Ware and Baxter experiemented with various ways of using a bat tocontrol &quot;brush&quot; size, position, color, and sensitivity to hand motion in apaint program.andP;  They found that users can control x, y, z, and rolindependently, but azimuth and elevation are harder to control independent ofhand translation.andP;  Users who were artists were not completely comfortablewith the various methods of position control but were enthusiastic about theease of changing colors.andM;Screening and Sorting Mail.andP;  Do you waste time reading irrelevant electronicnews and mail, while having the nagging feeling that you may be missingsomething important on an unexamined distribution list?andP;  Tom Malone and hiscolleagues have been working for several years on the Information Lens, asystem for filtering and classifying incoming messages based onuser-specified rules (e.g., move messages on the want-ad list with the wordcar in the subject field to my urgent folder).andP;  The CHI '89 paper onInformation Lens, by Mackay, Malone, Crowston, Rao, and Cord, describes theway it was used at a corporate test site.andP;  Users with and without computerbackgrounds find it easy to specify screening and sorting rules, and mostfind it worthwhile.andP;  Similar rule-based mail handling agents may appear inPC-based mail systems soon.andM;User Interface Shoot-out.andP;  Representatives from Apple, NeXT, Sun, and theOpen Software Foundation were invited to defend the proposition that theirswas the best user interface.andP;  Apple's representative, Tom Erickson, stressedthat the Mac interface is not best because it has the neatest looking widgetsor the simplest scroll bars but because it has wide understanding and supportamong users and developers.andP;  His comments reminded me of the longevity ofFortran.andP;  Someone from the audience commented that the &quot;shoot-out&quot; seemedlike four candidates in a one-party country, differing only superficially.andM;Hypertext in the Real World.andP;  Anyone who is thinking of building a hypertextapplication would be interested in reading Robert Glushko's paper on hisexperience in adapting a multi-volume, printed engineering encyclopedia toCD-ROM.andP;  This is an excellent case study with many valuable lessons.andO;Building on his experience with the engineering encyclopedia, Glushko hasprepared a tutorial entitled &quot;Turning Text into Hypertext,&quot; which he willoffer at CHI '90.andM;Sketching with a Draw Program.andP;  Bitmapped paint programs alow flexibility indrawing and sketching but do not create manipulable objects.andP;  Draw programsare object-oriented, but sketching some shapes can be awkward.andP;  For example,interlocking jigsaw objects like these: would be difficult to draw.andP;  PatrickBoudelaire and Michele Gangnet presented a paper describing extensions to aconventional draw program in which the sketch of a quickly drawn,multi-element object can be cleaned up by operations like trimming awaydangling edges, drawing its outline, or cutting or punching it with acookie-cutter-like contour.andP;  With their system, the objects shown above couldbe quickly created by cutting the outer shape with a contour.andP;  They alsopresented a paper on this work at SIGGRAPH '89.andM;Computers for the People.andP;  In a panel session, J.D.andP;  Eveland described afield study he did in collaboration with Tora Bikson.andP;  They gave homecomputers and electronic-mail accounts to a group of employees old enough toretire and recent retirees at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.andO;These people and a control group without email were asked to prepare a reporton the transition to retirement.andP;  Eveland and Bikson followed the groups fora year.andP;  The group with computers was able to make good use of them.andP;  Theyevolved a different social structure and produced a different report than thecontrol group.andP;  This experiment put computers in the hands of people whootherwise would not have them.andP;  It reminded me of the early days of personalcomputing, with the idealistic dream of computing power for all--of thePeople's Computer Company, Bob Albrecht's walk-in computer center for kids,card-table booths at the first Computer Faire, and Steve Wozniak giving awaycopies of the schematics for the Apple I at Homebrew Club meetings.andP;  Who elsein the community could benefit from access to home computers and emailaccounts?andM;There were many other interesting papers and sessions.andP;  For example, JefRaskin described a two-part cursor that shows both the points of nextinsertion and deletion.andP;  Experimental user-interface management systems weredescribed by researchers at Lockheed and Brigham Young University.andP;  Twoexperiments showed the efficacy of combining voice and gesture for inputcommands, and researchedrs from the University of Colorado reported on expertsystems for kitchen layout which incorporate hypertext help and an intuitivegraphical interface where the user moves sinks and appliances around on afloorplan.andM;Commercial ExhibitsandM;CHI '89 had only a few commercial exhibits, but this allowed for more time tospend with each exhibitor.andP;  And the visits were relaxed.andP;  My favoritecommercial exhibit was Freestyle, Wang's multimedia mail system.andM;Freestyle is a suite of hardware options and programs to supportcollaboration between users of networked PCs.andP;  The minimum Freestyleworkstation is an AT-compatible PC equipped with Wang's digitizing tablet,stylus and Freestyle software.andP;  By typing a hotkey, the user can interrupt aDOS session, run Freestyle, then return to DOS at will.andP;  Wang provides asnapshot utility to transfer an image of the DOS screen (perhaps a page froma spreadsheet) into the Freestyle environment.andM;Once in Freestyle, you can annotate the screen image by writing, typing orspeaking, storing it, or sending it to someone else.andP;  You can do the samewith scanned or FAX pages or those sent by others.andP;  For example, someonecould send you a travel request, and you could sign and return it, approvingthe expenditure.andM;Showing Freestyle at CHI was appropriate because it has several uniqueinterface characteristics.andP;  For one, the annotations may be played back asanimation rather than just viewing the final result.andP;  You could record asession in which you drew a diagram, thinking out loud as you went along.andO;When someone played the session back, they would not merely see the finaldiagram; they would see it drawn while you spoke.andP;  These sessions may bestopped, started, or fast-forwarded.andM;The look and feel is also unusual.andP;  Instead of the typical multi-windowdisplay, you either view a single desktop (Figure 2) with relatively largeicons representing your phone, file cabinet, trash, in-box, out-box, printer,stapler, staple-remover, scanner, &quot;pads&quot; of blank paper, copier, folders, anddocumens or a document page.andP;  The primary transaction unit is the page, andwhen you are working on a page, it fills the entire screen.andM;The stylus/tablet interface is smooth.andP;  Unlike a mouse, a stylus iscontrolled by the fingers, making precise control for writing and drawingpossible.andP;  Control functions like selection, dragging, and scrolling are donewith the stylus and pop-up menus.andP;  To signal confirmation, you tap the stylustip on the tablet, and the pencil metaphor is extended by erasing with theback end of the stylus.andM;Freestyle is a bureaucrat's dream--effortlessly shuffling forms from one deskto another for initials--and voice-drawing sessions add a significantdimension to electronic mail.andP;  Still, I wonder how well Freestyle will sell.andO;It is expensive.andP;  A tablet and software for a minimal workstation is over$2,000, and the network server software is $795.andP;  With a voice input board,scanner, FAX, full-page display, and a printer, the price is over $14,000.andO;Using Freestyle is fun, but those are not toy prices.andM;Perhaps it can be justified in niche applications, and with some developmenttools, Freestyle could be integrated into customvertical applications or usedin an R-and-D environment.andP;  Even if it turns out to be a commercial pioneer,with arrows in its back, Freestyle deserves the design excellence award itreceived at the 1989 Hannover Trade Fair.andM;If You Missed ItandM;If you missed CHI '89, you can still get copies of the proceedings andconference video tapes from ACM.andP;  The video tapes show demonstrations of 20research and commercial systems in five categories:andM;(1) Education and training (2 demos, 19 minutes) including a system foraphasic peopleandM;(2) Computer support of cooperative work (4 demos, 28 minutes) includingWang's FreestyleandM;(3) Computing environments (4 demos, 51 minutes) including Carnegie Mellon'sAndrew systemandM;(4) Interface technology (4 demos, 24 minutes) including IBM's Paper-Like forhandwritten writing and gestures.andM;(5) Sound and light (6 demos, 58 minutes) multimedia applications includingMIT's Illustrated Anatomy Glossary.andM;If all of this sounds interesting, you might plan a trip to next year's CHI,which will be in Seattle during April 1-5, 1990.andM;If you have comments or questions, please email or call the author atInternet: 1press@venera.isi.edu or (213) 475-6515.andM;Further reading on some of the CHI '89 topics:andM;Eveland, J.D., and Bikson, T.K.andP;
