WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush has a problem with women voters,and Dan Quayle's blond good looks and youthful charm aren't enoughto help him out, analysts of women's voting trends say.   The gender gap, the difference between political preferences ofmen and women, has been nettlesome for the Republican presidentialcandidate this year. Polls show a significant lead for Democraticnominee Michael Dukakis among women voters.   Bush advisers, some GOP delegates, and the vice presidenthimself cited an appeal to women as one explanation for theselection of the Indiana senator as Bush's running mate.   ``We need the female vote. He'll do the trick,'' said SharonEstrada, a delegate from Billings, Mont. ``He's very cute.''   But the suggestion that Quayle is attractive to female voters _based on physical appearance rather than issues _ sparkeddisagreement and even outrage among some women.   ``Oh, come on _ that's stupid,'' said Delaware delegate LynnGlaze, who led a futile effort to add support for the Equal RightsAmendment to the GOP platform. ``Women will vote on the economicissue, on the day care issue. They're not going to vote for someonebecause of his looks.''   ``This is not a screen test _ this is about an election,'' saidJane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's Campaign Fund, thelargest women's political action committee.   ``It appears like the Republicans are attempting to woo thewomen's vote rather than win it. It's a sad strategy,'' she said.   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., warned that the gender gap is ``themajor threat George Bush's campaign faces.''   Dukakis has enjoyed an advantage among women over Bush that isas large as 32 percentage points in a Harris poll taken in lateJuly. Other polls in the last six weeks have shown Dukakis' leadamong women to be at least 12 percentage points.   The Dukakis campaign believes the figure currently is about 18points, said Nikki Heideprim, Dukakis' adviser on the women's vote.   Republican analysts saw the selection of Quayle, the 41-year-oldconservative Indiana senator, as a choice that carried appeal tohis generation of young adults born after World War II, and towomen voters.   ``I think he will be someone who will help the ticket with allthe voters, and particularly women voters of that generation,''said Bush pollster Robert Teeter.   At his first news conference with Quayle, Bush cited both thosefactors as well. He called Quayle ``a running mate who has recordof strong appeal to young people and to women voters in his statebecause of his record.''   Nancy Neuman, president of the League of Women Voters, said Bushunderestimated women voters if he believed Quayle would helpimprove the GOP ticket's support among women because of hisappearance.   ``Do you think anybody would have said that about GeraldineFerraro?'' she said, referring to the 1984 Democratic nominee forvice president. ``It's sexist.   ``The idea that somebody's telegenic and gorgeous and that's whypeople will vote for him is patronizing,'' Neuman said.   Political analysts say they believe the gender gap is driven bydifferences in the way women and men feel on key issues,principally economic and social ones.   Democratic polltaker Mark Mellman says the gender gap isbecoming institutionalized _ that women tend to identify more withthe Democratic Party.   ``The fact the Bush people would even think the looks of acandidate would be important, I think shows how profound theirmisunderstanding is of the nature and sources of their problem withwomen voters,'' Mellman said.   Quayle has been an opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment and isa fierce opponent of abortion. He supports Bush's plan for taxcredits to low-income families for child care, beyond the existingchild care credit, and opposes national standards for day care.   Quayle, his supporters point out, won a landslide re-electionwith 61 percent of the vote over a female opponent in 1986. Heshowed strength among both women and men voters, although hisopponent ran an underfinanced campaign.   Quayle has been popular with middle-aged and older women as acampaigner in Indiana. He frequently hugs an elderly woman oraccepts a peck on the cheek when working the crowds at county fairsand parades.   After his selection, Quayle said, ``Women ought to resent thesuggestion that they would vote for somebody on looks. That is aninsult to women. I think it's absolute nonsense. It is demeaning towomen.''</TEXT></DOC>
