(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inmates at a medium-security stateprison released their last two hostages today, ending athree-day-old prison riot in which they seized eight hostages andcaused $2.5 million damage.   ``For all practical purposes, it's over,'' prison spokesmanJerry Massie said in Oklahoma City as corrections officials inStringtown examined the freed hostages. About 10 inmates who hadtaken hostages were checked and loaded on a bus for transfer toother prisons, officials said.   Shortly after the bus pulled out of the prison parking lot at11:20 a.m., an Oklahoma Highway Patrol tactical team packed up itsgear and began leaving, about 59 hours after the uprising started.   Although investigators said they were told that a body was foundinside a dormitory building, a county medical examiner said no bodywas found.   Corrections Director Gary Maynard said a total of 51 inmateswere to be moved out of the medium-security prison and would betaken to the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center or to theOklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.   Maynard, speaking at a news conference before leaving OklahomaCity for an inspection of the Stringtown correctional center, saidinvestigators will begin interviewing inmates today.   Maynard said as far as corrections officials know now, the riotwas not racially motivated. He admitted, however, that a disputeabout theft of property reported as the cause of the riotapparently ``involved black and white inmates.''   Prison spokeswoman Anita Trammell said 30 to 35 inmates who werenot involved in the hostage taking and remained in their cellsduring the standoff remained inside the prison.   ``They will be contained, stripped, fed and watered,'' she said.``We are going to determine who participated in the hostagesituation _ who set fires.''   The last two hostages were freed after officials agreed earliertoday to televise the inmates' surrender. None of the Oklahoma Citystations showed tape of the inmates' surrender, although they didcut into their programs with live reports.   Ronnie Scott, a corrections officer, was freed about 10 a.m.Thirty minutes later, Sgt. Harold Yoder was released. Both men wereundergoing medical examinations, but Massie said they wereapparently fine.   Separate groups of inmates had held Yoder and Scott, Massie said.   Eight hostages were initially taken in the riot that beganFriday night.   The tentative agreement to free the last two hostages wasreached early this morning in negotations involving the inmates,prison officials and legislators.   Officials also agreed to a demand from the approximately 20inmates that three state legislators the convicts met with Sundaywould witness today's surrender, Massie said.   The agreement was reached after a guard held with the otherssince the uprising began was released late Sunday, officials said.   One inmate and one guard sustained minor injuries during thetakeover of the overcrowded, medium-security Mack AlfordCorrectional Center.   Under the agreement, the inmates were to let the hostages goafter a bus arrives to take them away, then come out of thedormitory where they have been holed up since late Friday, Ms.Trammell said.   The bus to take the inmates to another prison arrived outsidethe center at 8:20 a.m. but did not immediately enter the prisongrounds.   In exchange for food and the earlier meeting with the threestate lawmakers, the inmates late Sunday released prison Capt.Lewis McGee.   ``He's tired; he's in good health. He's glad its over with,''Ms. Trammell said. She said the other hostages also were thought tobe unharmed.   Authorities gave the convicts soft drinks, ice cream andcigarettes at their request, said corrections spokeswoman JoyHadwiger. Temperatures in the area Sunday were in the low 90s.   The inmates also demanded restoration of electricity andmeetings with reporters and an American Civil Liberties Unionattorney who has helped prisoners, Ms. Trammell said. Officials didnot say if those demands would be met.   In addition to corrections officers, an 18-member Highway Patroltactical unit and as many as 40 other patrol officers kept watch onthe prison.   On Sunday afternoon, two inmates took one hostage, Yoder,outside for less than 10 minutes and talked to officers through afence. Yoder was used as a shield by inmates who worked to close ahole in the fence cut by prison officials to help other inmatessurrender, she said.   She said the hostage-takers told the 30 to 35 other inmateslocked in the occupied south dorm that their lives would be indanger if they tried to leave. Ms. Trammell said, however, thatthose inmates said they didn't feel like hostages.   The insurgents hung sheets with messages written on them fromthe roof of the two-story south dormitory.   The first sheet said ``White Power.'' A second said, ``DOC WillNot Respond to Demands. They Have Lied to You the Public andPress.'' A third requested help from news reporters.   Of the three guards held Sunday, one was white, one black andone an American Indian. Five guards were released unharmedSaturday. A guard who was not taken hostage and an inmate sustainedminor injuries.   Most of the prisoners who were routed from dormitories weretransferred to other prisons.   Ms. Hadwiger said 150 were being held in a gymnasium area of theprison awaiting relocation.   The prison, located about 130 miles southeast of Oklahoma City,had 652 inmates when the rebellion began but an operationalcapacity of 492, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
