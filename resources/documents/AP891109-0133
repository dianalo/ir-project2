Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's Director of International Affairs, saidthe Washington office would seek to persuade the Bushadministration to impose additional economic sanctions againstSouth Africa.   Mbeki told reporters the Bush administration, in marked contrastto its predecessor, believes the existing sanctions have alreadyforced the South African government to liberalize its policiestoward the country's black majority.   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said recently thatwhile the administration opposes harsher sanctions at this time, itwould be willing to consider them if no progress is made towardblack-white negotiations in South Africa by next summer.   Mbeki said the Bush administration differs with its predecessoron another point. ``Clearly the Bush administration has moved awayfrom the notion that the South African government must be pacified,pampered, pleased,'' he said at a news conference.   While Bush's meetings with prominent anti-apartheid leaders suchas Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Albertina Sisulu are important,Mbeki said, ``the greatest contribution Bush could and should makeis further sanctions.''   The sanctions were imposed in 1986 by Congress, after itoverrode a veto by former President Reagan.   The ANC opened a similar office in Moscow last year, and alreadyhas about 40 representatives abroad, Mbeki said.   Mbeki, whose father Govan Mbeki was one of seven top ANCofficials released from prison last week after 25 years incaptivity, said the United States appears committed to pushing foran end to the racial discrimination policies in South Africa.   He said the ANC had been encouraged by administration officialsto open its office here ``because they know we are central to thesolution of the South African problem.''   The ANC is concerned the United States may let up pressure onnewly elected President F.W. De Klerk, who has been liberalizinghis government's policies toward blacks but has rejected givingthem the vote and maintains wide powers of arrest and censorship.   If that turns out to be the case, Mbeki said, ``we have toresurrect'' the pressure.   Conservatives in Congress contend the ANC is funded by theSoviet Union and that its armed wing is supplied by the Sovietbloc. Mbeki said there would always be ``those who don't like us''but that the question of Soviet support was ``not an issue'' withthe administration.   In 1987, then-Secretary of State George Shultz met with ANCleader Oliver Tambo. Regular meetings have been conducted with thegroup's representatives ever since.</TEXT></DOC>
