Nevertheless, Deluxe shares have struggled recently, closing yesterday at 22 3/8, down 1/4 for the day and not far from the stock's 52-week low of 20. Analysts expect the company to post its first quarter of lower profit in more than 10 years when it reports second-quarter results in the next 10 days or so; the company declines to estimate earnings.    But these days some investors and analysts are becoming avid buyers of Deluxe shares. They say the stock has been pounded down enough.    &quot;If you're going to buy a stock like this, you've got to be able to buy it when there are some problems,&quot; contends John W. Rogers Jr., the head of Ariel Capital Management, Chicago. &quot;Otherwise, you'll never be able to buy it cheap enough.&quot;    Deluxe's earnings are expected to be hurt in the next few quarters as a result of several recent moves. The St. Paul, Minn.-based concern has embarked on a hefty plant-rebuilding program designed to make its check-printing facilities the industry's most advanced.    The new machines, which will be able to print checks in one pass rather than two, are likely to cut costs by requiring reduced staffing. Yet Deluxe has held to its no-layoffs policy. As a result, costs haven't declined as quickly as some analysts, such as Goldman Sachs's Eric S. Philo, would like. &quot;I was expecting to see more in the way of productivity improvement than we have seen so far,&quot; he says, adding that he rates the stock a &quot;hold.&quot;    In addition, Deluxe is still working to digest several acquisitions, the largest of which is Current, a mail-order seller of greeting cards. The seasonal nature of Current's card business is hurting Deluxe as the parent isn't likely to reap the benefits until the greeting-card business picks up again in the Christmas quarter.    The company estimates that 70% of Current's profit and revenue come from fourth-quarter business, so Deluxe expects to post strong numbers for that period.    As Deluxe works those businesses out of the doldrums in the next couple of quarters, as many analysts expect, the core questions will again center on the company's check-printing business. Deluxe controls more than half of that business in the U.S., and checking contributes 75% of the company's revenue, analysts estimate.    While higher-tech minds have touted a checkless society featuring debit cards, the U.S. consumer has continued to write checks. Michael A. Hamilton, who follows Deluxe for Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood in Minneapolis, says an account holder writes an average of 25 checks a month, up from 18 or so in the late 1970s.    He cites the proliferation of NOW accounts at banks, the breakup of the Bell system, a rise in catalog sales and increased family mobility. It all adds up to a rise in the number of checks bought by households.    Meanwhile, the check-printing business has consolidated: Five players now control about 90% of the market. The issue for investors is whether Deluxe can lead price increases in the next several years.    Deluxe hasn't had much trouble raising prices in the past. About a year ago, Mr. Hamilton recalls, the Dallas bank MCorp tried to slash the price it would pay for checks, asking Deluxe to trim 20% from its prices. Deluxe balked and a competitor stepped in to accept the contract, startling investors.    But the move wasn't followed by other major banks. So the bullish analysts expect Deluxe and others to raise prices slightly, and for Deluxe to increase its unit growth by 3% to 5%.    Another area of interest to investors is the company's recent purchase of Deluxe Data Systems, the largest U.S. clearinghouse for automated teller machines. The business's unit volume has grown about 60% in the past year, while prices have slipped about 40% to roughly seven or eight cents per transaction, Mr. Hamilton says.    Deluxe is hoping to expand the data-systems business into point-of-sale machines, although that area has proved to be a tough one for other companies to turn a profit.    Analysts project that Deluxe will earn $1.70 to $1.80 a share this year before a roughly four-cent-a-share gain from changes in accounting rules. Last year, Deluxe posted operating income of $1.54 a share.    But they also expect the company to show a decline in second-quarter profit from last year's 39 cents. That's just fine with Ariel's Mr. Rogers, who says he's had his eye on Deluxe stock for seven or eight years but always found it too pricey.    &quot;Too often people overreact to a bad quarter,&quot; he asserts. &quot;I'm planning to buy more after the earnings announcement.&quot;    ---   Deluxe   (NYSE; Symbol: DLX)   Business: Check printing   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Sales: $948 million   Net income: $148.5 million; or $1.74 a share*   First quarter, March 31, 1988:   Per-share earnings: 40 cents vs. 35 cents   Average daily trading volume: 228,064 shares   Common shares outstanding: 85.1 million   *Includes nonrecurring gain of $16 million related to sale of Data Card Corp. stock</TEXT></DOC>
