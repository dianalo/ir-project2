This second human immunodeficiency virus -- called HIV-2 -- is not merely a new strain but a distinct new member of the HIV virus family, the report said. Genetic analysis shows it to be almost 60% different from HIV-1, a troubling fact that allows nearly half of people infected with HIV-2 to escape detection under the AIDS blood tests currently in use at blood banks and clinics in the U.S. and abroad.    The report, by Mireille Guyader, Marc Alizon, Luc Montagnier and their colleagues at the Pasteur Institute, is scheduled for publication today in the British scientific journal Nature.    The HIV-2 virus was isolated from 20 AIDS patients from Guinea Bissau and other countries of West Africa, as well as from Europe. Although transmitted, like HIV-1, by sexual and blood contact, it shares only 42% of the genes of its sibling virus HIV-1. This indicates a common evolutionary origin, the scientists said, but a divergent history. Indeed, the HIV-2 virus shares more genes with the monkey AIDS virus (STLV-3) than with the original human AIDS virus.    &quot;The evolutionary potential of these viruses is therefore striking,&quot; the report concluded, &quot;and we must therefore ask whether other HIVs can emerge as long as a favorable epidemiological situation is provided.&quot;    &quot;The fact that these two viruses have been detected in Africa in a short period of time -- HIV-1 in Africa 10 years ago and HIV-2 in West Africa two years ago -- suggests the two epidemics arose due to favorable conditions,&quot; Francois Clavel, a co-author of the report, explained in an interview. &quot;Lots of people from the villages of Central Africa have moved to the big cities, where sexual promiscuity is greater. That's the reason for amplification of these viruses.&quot;    &quot;Now it must be determined how many patients in the United States are infected with HIV-2,&quot; Dr. Clavel explained. &quot;It seems to be limited mostly to West Africa. We've found some patients in Europe, but it's very small.&quot;    Pasteur Diagnostics, a corporate offshoot of the Pasteur Institute that manufactures test kits, is already at work on an AIDS blood-test kit that would include antigens, or virus proteins, found in both HIV-1 and HIV-2, Dr. Clavel added.    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta is starting to do a study in conjunction with Seattle-based Genetic Systems to screen blood serums for HIV-2 in an effort to learn more about whether the new virus is present in the U.S., said Patricia N. Fultz, chief of CDC's animal model studies. Genetic Systems is a unit of Bristol-Myers Co., a New York-based health-care products concern. &quot;Eventually, to keep our blood supply clean, we may have to screen for both viruses,&quot; Ms. Fultz said.    That doesn't appear imminent, however, according to a top medical official of the American Red Cross. Gerald Sandler, associate vice president of the American Red Cross, which collects about 12 million units of donated blood a year in the U.S., said, &quot;We've been following reports of the limited cross-reactivity (the extent to which the two viruses test in the same ways) of the U.S. and African viruses. (But) we have no evidence that these new African isolates are present in the U.S. For that reason, we are not contemplating screening for it.&quot;    &quot;With a virus so rare, it might not be necessary to introduce 12 million tests each year in the United States at a cost of more than $100 million,&quot; Dr. Sandler said, suggesting alternate means of excluding donors at risk for HIV-2. In the case of malaria, for example, he said eliminating blood donors recently returned from malaria-infested countries has proved effective.    While the new African virus may complicate future blood-screening, it won't necessarily hamper the search for drugs to treat AIDS. Said Dr. Clavel, &quot;For drug therapy, these viruses clearly belong to the same family and replicate in the same way.&quot;    &quot;Their regulatory genes are similar,&quot; he added, as is the critical gene for reverse transcriptase, an enzyme needed for AIDS virus to reproduce. AZT, an AIDS drug now being sold by Burroughs-Wellcome Co., and similar drugs act by inhibiting that enzyme. Burroughs-Wellcome is the U.S. unit of London-based Wellcome PLC, a pharmaceuticals concern.    Vaccine development may be a different matter, however. Most vaccines now under development seek to spark an immune response by using proteins found on the envelope, or outer coat of the virus. And the outer coats of HIV-1 and HIV-2 are 60% different, Dr. Clavel said. Therefore, it will be necessary to search for &quot;patches of homology&quot; or sameness, on those coats if a vaccine is to protect against both AIDs viruses, he said.    Still, HIV-2 may have a silver lining in its properties for animal research, said Ms. Fultz of the CDC. HIV-2 infects rhesus monkeys, unlike HIV-1, which apart from humans, can only infect rare and expensive chimpanzees. &quot;Rhesus monkeys are smaller, cheaper, easier to work with and more plentiful than chimps,&quot; she explained. This should enable expansion of tests to try out many more potential vaccines, she noted. &quot;We're excited about the rhesus monkey model.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
