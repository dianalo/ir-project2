(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fourth body was found Saturday asauthorities continued a top-to-bottom search of the wreckage of ahotel that was swept by fire as residents slept.   Ten tenants were still unaccounted-for in the fire that hit theFontana Hotel before dawn Friday.   ``We believe there are more victims inside,'' said police Capt.Rocco DeLeo. ``What we are doing is getting details from relativesof people who we believe are missing and getting the physicalcharacteristics of these persons.''   One hundred and one of the 102 rooms were rented out, but no oneis sure exactly how many people were in the hotel at the time ofthe fire, said Olimpia Mihai, one of the Fontana's owner-managers.Estimates of the number of inhabitants has ranged up to 150; theregistration records were burned in the fire.   As federal, state and city teams launched a top-to-bottomsearch, a crane was brought in to help pick apart the gutted ruinsof the hotel.   Investigators broke off their search at sundown Saturday andplanned to return Sunday morning with specially trained dogs tosearch for bodies, said Miami Beach police Detective Jim Hyde.   With the cause still a mystery, U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnsonissued a search warrant at the request of the U.S. Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to preserve any evidence that mightbe needed later in court. The bureau conducts arson investigations.   Mayor Alex Daoud said fire officials told him Friday that arsonwas strongly suspected, but Fire Chief Branaird Dorris said tenantshad mentioned a water leak, which raised the possibility of anelectrical short.   ``Whenever you have a serious loss of life, and a substantialloss of property damage and money, a warrant is routine,'' Hydesaid Saturday.   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, who donned a hard hat to inspectthe three-story hotel, said the purpose of the warrant was tolegally preserve any possible evidence.   He played down the significance of his visit, saying: ``Youshouldn't judge the importance of any particular investigation bywhat officials are there.''   Asked when the death toll would be known, Robert Creighton, ATFagent in charge of the Florida office, said: ``We may have that intwo days. It all depends on what we find.''   Names of 14 residents who had not been seen since the fire wereprovided by surviving tenants.   The four bodies found so far _ two women, a man and a fourthperson whose sex wasn't immediately determined _ were tentativelyassumed to be among the 14 missing, Hyde said.   ``We're bringing our total of unaccounted-for people to ten,''Hyde said. ``Again, this is an approximate `guesstimate' based oninformation we were given by residents of the hotel.''   Twenty-one hotel residents were taken to three area hospitalsFriday, and five remained hospitalized in good condition Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
