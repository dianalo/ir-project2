In a drifting plasma the upstream-downstreamasymmetry of the main cone is suitable for diagnostics of plasma drifts.The evaluation of electron temperature from the interference patternis discussed in terms of the low-temperature-low-drift-approximation(LTLDA) and by comparing with numerical kinetic theory calculations.In this way the range of applicability of this method is extended abovethe LTLDA. In a beam-plasma situation, the downstream resonance coneexhibits a new interference pattern, which can be attributed to resonantparticle effects. The upstream resonance cone is only slightly affectedand is found still applicable for T/sub e/ and n/sub e/ diagnostics.As a result of the comparison with numerical calculations, in which theactual distribution function is used, the downstream interference patternis proposed to be useful as a diagnostic method for obtaining the meanbeam energy. The waves generated by the beam plasma interaction are analyzedby digital cross-correlation techniques. They are found to be Whistlerwaves propagating obliquely to the magnetic field direction at the resonancecone angle.</TEXT></DOC>
