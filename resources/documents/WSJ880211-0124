BHP plans to effectively buy back some of its shares from Elders and financier Robert Holmes a Court, its two biggest shareholders. BHP and Bell have called shareholder meetings to consider the plan, but Elders hasn't. The stock exchange said it has asked a state supreme court to direct Elders to comply with exchange rules by calling a meeting.    The KUWAIT INVESTMENT OFFICE, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, said it raised its stake in BRITISH PETROLEUM CO. to 19.27% from 19.24%. The office has called its holding a long-term investment.    N.V. PHILIPS said it will eliminate between 250 and 300 jobs at four facilities in the Netherlands as part of a continuing cost-cutting program. The big Dutch electronics group said it will cut jobs at factories supplying a division that makes up &quot;a relatively large part&quot; of the company's professional products and systems group. Philips's Dutch labor force has been reduced by 30%, to about 70,000 employees at the end of 1987. The cutbacks were related to severely squeezed profit margins in the Netherlands, a spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
