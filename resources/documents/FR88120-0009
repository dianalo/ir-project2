Background </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 29, 1982 (47 FR 4406), FDA publisheda proposed rule containing general provisions applicable to the classificationof radiology devices and individual proposed regulations to classify 73devices. FDA has withdrawn the proposals to classify 2 of the 73 proposeddevices (September 17, 1982; 47 FR 41139) because FDA's Center for DrugEvaluation and Research regulates the radionuclide generator as a radiopharmaceuticaldrug, and the automatic contrast medium injector is essentially the sameas, or is included in, the angiographic injector and syringe that has beenclassified into class II as a cardiovascular device (21 CFR 890.1650).As to the remaining 71 proposed regulations, in this final rule FDA isclassifying 59 devices, as follows: 13 devices into class I, 44 devicesinto class II, 1 device into class III, and, depending upon its intendeduse, 1 device into class I or class III. FDA is postponing classificationsof certain versions or all versions of 14 devices, as described below under``D. Devices Not Being Classified at this Time.'' FDA provided a period of 60 days, later extended to 90 days (March 19,1982; 47 FR 11879), for interested persons to submit written comments onthe proposed regulations. The comments received and FDA's responses arediscussed below. Classification of medical devices in commercial distribution is requiredby section 513 of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-295)(the amendments) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)(21 U.S.C. 360c). The effect of classifying a device into class I is torequire that the device continue to meet only the general controls applicableto all devices. The effect of classifying a device into class II is toprovide for the future development of one or more performance standardsto assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. The effect of classifyinga device into class III is to require each manufacturer of the device tosubmit to FDA a premarket approval application that includes informationconcerning safety and effectiveness tests for the device. For a class IIIdevice not considered a new drug before the amendments that either wasin commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that is substantiallyequivalent to a device that was in commercial distribution before thatdate, each application for premarket approval must be submitted to FDAon or before July 31, 1990, or within 90 days after promulgation of a separateregulation requiring premarket approval of the device, whichever occurslater. Devices that FDA previously regarded as new drugs, or newly offereddevices that are not substantially equivalent to a device that was in commercialdistribution before the amendments, are classified by statute into classIII and already are required to have in effect an approved applicationfor premarket approval. See section 520(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360j(1)).The preamble to proposed regulations described the development of the generalprovisions and the proposed regulations classifying radiology devices andthe activities of the Radiology Devices Panel, an FDA advisory committeethat makes recommendations to FDA concerning the classification of radiologydevices. In April 1985, H.R. 2177 (99th Cong., 1st Sess.) was introduced in theU.S. House of Representatives. The bill was a legislative proposal of theDepartment of Health and Human Services. Among other things, the bill wouldhave (1) amended the act to eliminate the statutory category of class II,(2) and the establishment of a performance standard one of the severalgeneral controls that may be made applicable to a device, and (3) streamlinedthe procedure for establishing standards set out in section 514 of theact. If legislation comparable to this bill becomes law, there will betwo categories of devices, class I (general controls) and class II (premarketapproval, currently class III). Class II devices would be redesignatedas class I devices. Because this legislation included transitional provisionsthat translate classifications under the current law to classificationsunder the proposed law, FDA is continuing its issuance of classificationrules under the current law. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. FDA's Priorities for Establishing Performance Standards </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 23, 1985 (50 FR 43060), FDA publisheda notice, ``Policy Statement; Class II Medical Devices,'' announcing itspolicy for setting priorities for initiating proceedings to establish performancestandards for medical devices classified into class II. Under the amendments,FDA is required to establish performance standards for class II devices.At this time, however, FDA does not have the resources to establish performancestandards for all of the devices already classified (or being classified)in class II. Under the amendments, FDA is using the regulatory controlsof class I to regulate a device classified into class II until a performancestandard is established under section 514 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360d) forthe class II device. In that notice, FDA announced it will consider the following factors whensetting priorities for establishing performance standards for class IIdevices. A. The seriousness of questions concerning the safety and effectivenessof the device; the risks associated with use of the device; the significanceof a device to the public health; and the present and projected use ofthe device. b. The recommendations of FDA's advisory committees. c. The impact of an FDA guidelines or recommendation. d. The effect of a Federal standard or other regulatory controls underan authority other than the act. e. The impact of voluntary standards. f. The impact of activities authorized under the general controls provisionsof the act. g. The effect of dissemination of information and education efforts. h. The sufficiency of voluntary corrective actions. i. Valid scientific evidence developed since classification. j. The existence of a petition for reclassification. k. The impact of any other factors that affect a device's safety or effectiveness.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Changes in the Name of the Radiology Device Advisory Committee</ITAG>FDA has periodically reorganized its advisory panels for device classification.Most recently, on April 14, 1984, FDA established the Radiologic DevicesPanel (the Panel) (see 49 FR 17446; April 24, 1984). The new panel performsthe same functions with respect to radiology devices as did its predecessors,the Radiologic Devices Panel (1982-1984), the Obstetrics-Gynecology andRadiologic Devices Panel (1978-1982), and the Radiological Devices ClassificationPanel (1976-1978). Also, the charter for the new panel has been amendedto include the functions of the Medical Radiation Advisory Committee. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. Devices Not Being Classified at This Time </ITAG>FDA is postponing classification of certain versions or all versions ofthe 14 AC-powered radiology devices listed below, to give the agency timeto review additional data on the safety of electrically powered devices.Although FDA proposed to classify these devices into class II, it now isconsidering placing them in class I. When FDA does classify the devicesnot being classified at this time, it plans to use the same docket numbers.Note that, as a result of postponing classifications of certain versionsof two proposed thermographic devices and classifying other versions ofthese two devices in this final rule, each of these devices is countedtwice_once as a device with classification postponed and also as a devicenow being classified. FDA proposed to classify the AC-powered telethermographic system (andSection;892.1450) into class II for certain intended uses and into class III forother intended uses. The agency is postponing the classification of thisdevice intended for adjunctive diagnostic use and, in this final rule,is classifying the device intended for use as a sole diagnostic screeningtool. FDA proposed to classify the AC-powered versions of the liquid crystalthermographic system into class II or class III, depending upon the intendeduse of the device. FDA is postponing the classification of the AC-poweredversions of the device intended for adjunctive diagnostic use. In thisfinal rule, FDA is classifying all non-AC-powered versions of the deviceand is classifying the AC-powered versions of the device intended for useas a sole diagnostic screening tool. Further, in this final rule, FDA is codifying classifications of the telethermographicsystem and the liquid crystal thermographic system in 21 CFR Part 884_Obstetricaland Gynecological Devices, because FDA believes this part to be a moreappropriate place to publish these classifications in the Code of FederalRegulations.The 14 devices whose classifications are being postponed are listed below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,p8,8/9,i1,xs51,r25,10</C>  <H1>Section No. </H1><H1>Device </H1><H1>Docket No. </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1. 892.1100 <D>Scintillation gamma camera </D><D>78N-2743 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2. 892.1110 <D>Positron camera </D><D>78N-2744 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3. 892.1130 <D>Nuclear whole body counter </D><D>78N-2745 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4. 892.1300 <D>Nuclear rectilinear scanner </D><D>78N-2750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5. 892.1320 <D>Nuclear uptake probe </D><D>78N-2752 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6. 892.1330 <D>Nuclear whole body scanner </D><D>78N-2753 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7. 892.1350 <D>Nuclear scanning bed </D><D>78N-2754 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8. 892.1410 <D>Nuclear electrocardiograph synchronizer </D><D>78N-2760 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9. 884.2980 (formerly 892.1450) <D>AC-powered telethermographic system </D><D>78N-2762 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10. 884.2982 (formerly 892.1480) <D>AC-powered liquid crystal thermographic system </D><D>78N-2763 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11. 892.1640 <D>Radiographic film marking system </D><D>78N-2773 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12. 892.1890 <D>Radiographic film illuminator </D><D>78N-2795 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13. 892.1900 <D>Automatic radiographic film processor </D><D>78N-2796 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14. 892.1970 <D>Radiographic ECG/respirator synchronizer </D><D>78N-2803</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">E.

The purpose of publishing a proposed regulationand soliciting comments is to enable the agency to determine whether itsproposed classification of a device was correct. After reviewing the commentssubmitted on a proposed regulation, the agency may be persuaded that itsproposed classification is incorrect. Persons interested in the classificationprocess should, therefore, anticipate that in a final regulation a devicemay be placed in a class different from the one originally proposed. Thispossibility was specifically identified in the proposed general regulationfor radiology devices (see 47 FR 4406; January 29, 1982). Persons who disagreewith the final classification of a device may petition for reclassificationof the device under Subpart C of Part 860 (21 CFR Part 860).<ITAG tagnum="84">F. List of Radiology Devices</ITAG>The list below shows for each radiology device the section of the Codeof Federal Regulations at which classification of that device is beingcodified, the docket number of the corresponding proposed classificationregulation, and the classification of each device in the final rule. Thelist includes the radiology devices for which final classifications arebeing postponed. For each of these devices, the section number of the Codeof Federal Regulations is in parentheses, the name of the device is identifiedwith footnote \1\<NOTE/> and no classification is provided. See ``D. Devices Not BeingClassified At This Time'' for a description of FDA's reasons for postponingclassifications of these devices. The names of six devices on the listwhose final classifications are different from the classifications proposedfor these devices are identified by an asterisk (*).

Summary of Comments on Classifications and FDA's Responses</ITAG>1. In FDA's proposed regulations, FDA proposed to classify most of theradiology devices into class II. Comments argued (arguments la through1h) that FDA should classify into class I many of the radiology devicesthat it proposed be in class II. FDA's responses to each of these argumentsfollow:1a. Some comments said that electrical shock from devices was not a significantrisk to health. These comments said that electrically powered radiologydevices should be classified into class I instead of class II as proposed.FDA currently is reviewing additional data on safety of electrically powereddevices. The agency is postponing classifications of those AC-powered radiologydevices it proposed be in class II, if FDA believes that the general controlsof class I alone are sufficient to control all risks to health presentedby the AC-powered devices, including the risks of electrical shock. Thus,FDA tentatively agrees that it should consider classifying certain AC-powereddevices into class I. However, as to those devices for which FDA believesthat the general controls of class I alone are insufficient to controlany risks to health presented by an AC-powered radiology device in additionto the risk of electrical shock, FDA believes that they should not be classifiedinto class I. Accordingly, FDA is postponing classifications of the 14proposed radiology devices listed earlier in this preamble under ``D. DevicesNot Being Classified At This Time'' while the agency reviews additionaldata on safety of electrically powered devices. Also, in this final ruleFDA is classifying certain AC-powered devices into class II or class IIIto control risks to health other than electrical shock presented by thesedevices.1b. Some comments said that voluntary standards exist for many radiologydevices. The comments requested that FDA classify devices subject of suchvoluntary standards into class I, instead of class II as proposed.FDA disagrees with the comments. FDA classifies devices using statutorycriteria in section 513 of the act. These statutory criteria do not includereliance on voluntary standards. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 23, 1985 (50 FR 43060), FDA publisheda final policy statement regarding class II devices. This statement identifiesthe factors that FDA takes into account in setting priorities for initiatingproceedings to establish performance standards under section 514 of theact for class II devices. Among the factors FDA considers is the existenceof an adequate adhered-to voluntary standard. FDA's final policy statementdoes not include a provision for reliance on voluntary standards, nor doesit provide for promotion of such standards. See ``B. FDA's Priorities forEstablishing Performance Standards'' at the beginning of this preamble.1c. A comment said that, when FDA classifies a device into class II, thisconstitutes a formal determination by FDA that without a performance standardthere is not reasonable assurance that a device is safe and effective.The comment said that many devices that FDA proposed be in class II shouldbe classified into class I until a mandatory standard is available. Thecomment suggested that, when a mandatory standard is available for sucha device, FDA could change the classification of the device to class II.FDA agrees that classification of a device into class II is a formal determinationby FDA that a mandatory performance standard is necessary (in additionto the requirements of general controls) to provide reasonable assuranceof the safety and effectiveness of a device. However, FDA disagrees thatthe agency could classify a device that meets the statutory criteria forclass II into class I until a mandatory performance standard is availableand then place the device into class II. Such a temporary classificationis unnecessary because the act provides that, until a standard for a classII device is established under section 514 of the act, the device may bemarketed subject only to the general controls of the act. Thus, the actprovides for the same marketing conditions that would apply if FDA temporarilyclassified a proposed class II device in class I.1d. Several general comments stated that FDA proposed to classify too manyradiology devices in class II and requested that FDA place more devicesin class I.FDA agrees that certain of the devices that it proposed to classify inclass II should be in class I. These devices are identified earlier inthis preamble under ``E. Changes in Classifications of Devices.'' FDA'sreasons for making these changes are provided below in paragraphs 3 and15. FDA's reasons for classifying other radiology devices into class IIas proposed are provided in FDA's responses below to comments on specificdevices. In ``A. Background'' above, this preamble describes the Departmentof Health and Human Services' legislative proposal to amend the act toeliminate the statutory category of class II. 1e. Some comments argued that FDA proposed to classify too many radiologydevices in class II, because FDA failed to weigh probable benefit againstprobable risk during its preparation of proposed classification regulationsfor radiology devices. The comments requested that FDA place more devicesin class I. These comments said that FDA's proposed regulations unfairlyrequired manufacturers to prove that their devices do not present healthrisks. FDA disagrees with the comments' argument that the proposed classificationsof certain radiology devices into class II are unfair and unreasonable.FDA also disagrees that it failed to weigh the probable benefits from theuse of devices against the probable risks of these devices. FDA believesthat the criteria it uses to determine the safety of a device, which criteriaare found in section 513(a)(2) of the act and in 21 CFR 860.7, are requiredby law and are reasonable. Further, FDA believes that any risk of injury or illness is unreasonablewhen no evidence is available of probable benefit to the health of thosepersons for whose use the device is intended. This conclusion is supportedby the legislative history of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub.L. 94-295). In its report, the House Committee on Interstate and ForeignCommerce explained the meaning of ``potential unreasonable risk'' as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The phrase `presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury'has two significant features. First, the requirement that a risk be unreasonablecontemplates a balancing of the possibility that illness or injury willoccur against benefits from use. Second, the risk need only be a potentialone. The risk may be one demonstrated by reported injuries or it may simplybe foreseeable. The fact that a device is being marketed without sufficienttesting is an adequate basis for the Secretary's conclusion that the devicepresents a potential unreasonable risk to health.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">H. Rept. 94-853, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 36 (1976). Further, the following language in 21 CFR 860.7(d)(1) describes the criteriaFDA uses to determine the safety of a device: <ITAG tagnum="21">There is reasonable assurance that a device is safe when it has beendetermined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that the probable benefitsto health from use of the device for its intended uses and conditions ofuse, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafeuse, outweigh any probable risks. The valid scientific evidence used todetermine the safety of a device shall adequately demonstrate the absenceof unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of thedevice for its intended uses and conditions of use. </ITAG>1f. As is clear, Congress contemplated imposition of the burden of proofof safety on the manufacturer. Some comments said that most of the radiologydevices that FDA proposed be in class II should be in class I because manufacturers'compliance with the general controls of class I, such as the requirementsof the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations (21 CFR Part820), would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectivenessof the devices. It is unnecessary, the comments argued, to establish performancestandards for these devices. FDA disagrees that manufacturers' compliance with general controls wouldprovide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectivness of many ofthe radiology devices that FDA proposed be in class II. FDA believes that,for certain devices, performance standards to control biocompatibility,electrical safety, sterility, radiation emission, or other characteristicssometimes are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of such devices. Also, FDA believes that certain devicesshould be classified into class III under the relevant statutory criteria.1g. A number of comments requested that FDA classify more radiology devicesinto class I, because classifying such devices into class II would slowdevelopment of new devices. FDA disagrees with the comments. Classification regulations have littleimmediate impact on device development because they apply only to alreadydeveloped and marketed products. See the discussion under ``N. EconomicImpact'' later in this preamble. 1h. Some comments requested that many devices that FDA proposed be in classII instead be placed in class I because these devices are intended foruse by health care professionals, and establishment of mandatory performancestandards for these radiology devices is unnecessary. FDA disagrees with the comments. The agency bases its classifications ofdevices on characteristics of the devices themselves under criteria establishedin the statute. FDA's classifications are intended to assure that the radiologydevices being used by health care professionals perform as intended, andotherwise provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectivenessof devices. FDA's criteria and process for classifying devices are describedearlier in this paragraph.2. Some comments argued that several diagnostic X-ray systems or componentsof diagnostic X-ray systems that are listed below and that FDA proposedto be in class II are adequately regulated by the performance standardfor diagnostic X-ray systems and their major components (21 CFR 1020.30through 1020.32) promulgated under the Radiation Control for Health andSafety Act of 1968 (RCHSA) (Pub. L. 90-602, 42 U.S.C. 263f). The commentsnoted that all of the risks to health identified in the proposed regulationsare addressed by the performance standard for such devices. The commentsalso argued that additional standards issued under section 514 of the actwould be unnecessary, duplicative, and would not improve the safety andeffectiveness of such devices. These comments recommended that FDA classifythe radiology devices listed below (all of which are subject to the performancestandards in 21 CFR 1020.30 through 1020.32 and 21 CFR 1040.10) in classI rather than class II.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,p8,8/9,i1,xs36,r50,6</C> <H1>Section No. </H1><H1>Device</H1><H1>Proposed rule: FR page No.</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">892.1600<D>Angiographic X-ray system</D><D>4423</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1610<D>Diagnostic X-ray beam-limiting device</D><D>4424</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1630<D>Electrostatic X-ray imaging system</D><D>4424</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1650<D>Image-intensified fluoroscopic X-ray system</D><D>4425</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1660<D>Non-image-intensified fluoroscopic X-ray system</D><D>4425</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1670<D>Spot-film device</D><D>4426</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1680<D>Stationary X-ray system</D><D>4426</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1700<D>Diagnostic X-ray high voltage generator</D><D>4427</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1710<D>Mammographic X-ray system</D><D>4427</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1720<D>Mobile X-ray system</D><D>4428</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1730<D>Photofluorographic X-ray system</D><D>4428</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1740<D>Tomographic X-ray system</D><D>4428</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1750<D>Computed tomography X-ray system</D><D>4429</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1760<D>Diagnostic X-ray tube housing assembly</D><D>4429</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1830<D>Radiologic patient cradle</D><D>4430</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1860<D>Radiographic film/cassette changer</D><D>4432</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1870<D>Radiographic film/cassette changer programmer</D><D>4433</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1880<D>Wall-mounted radiographic cassette holder</D><D>4433</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5780<D>Light beam patient position indicator</D><D>4441</D></ITAG></ITAG>FDA believes that performance standards under section 514 of the act arenecessary (in addition to those under the Radiation Control for Healthand Safety Act) to control the risks to health presented by the 19 deviceslisted above that were identified in the proposed regulations (47 FR 4406at the page numbers shown above). FDA also believes that sufficient informationis available to establish such standards. Accordingly, FDA is adoptingthe proposed regulations for the devices listed above with minor clarifyingchanges.3. A number of comments requested that FDA classify the 13 devices listedbelow in this paragraph into class I instead of class II as proposed, arguingthat the risks to health presented by these devices are adequately controlledthrough the licensing requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) and the Agreement States. ``Agreement States'' are those states whichhave entered into an effective agreement with the NRC or its predecessor,the Atomic Energy Commission, under section 247b of the Atomic Energy Actof 1954, as amended (73 Stat. 689).FDA agrees in part and disagrees in part with these comments, as shownbelow in responses 3a and 3c.Response 3a.

NRC and agreement statesensure that sources are encapsulated, sealed, and accurately calibrated.Sealing of sources and compliance with CGMP's provide adequate assuranceof safety.

In addition, the radionuclide brachytherapy sourceis intended to be occasionally implanted in the human body. Section 513(d)(2)(B)of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(d)(2)(B)) requires that FDA classify all implantsinto class III unless the agency determines that, for a particular implant,premarket approval is unnecessary to provide reasonable assurance of itssafety and effectiveness. FDA believes that insufficient evidence of safetyand effectiveness is now available to classify into class I any radiologydevice intended to be implanted. Therefore, performance standards undersection 514 of the act are necessary for all three devices to control therisks to health identified in the proposed regulations for these devices.FDA also believes that sufficient information is available to establishsuch standards. Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposed regulations forthe three devices listed above with minor clarifying changes.4. Other comments requested that FDA classify the 11 devices listed belowinto class I instead of class II as proposed, arguing that the devicescould safely be placed in class I, because voluntary standards exist forthese devices.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,p8,8/9,i1,xs36,r50,6</C> <H1>Section No.</H1><H1>Device</H1><H1>Proposed rule; FR page No.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1310<D>Nuclear tomography system</D><D>4415</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1540<D>Nonfetal ultrasonic monitor</D><D>4421</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1550<D>Ultrasonic pulsed doppler imaging system</D><D>4422</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1560<D>Ultrasonic pulsed echo imaging system</D><D>4422</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1570<D>Diagnostic ultrasonic transducer</D><D>4423</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5050<D>Medical charged particle therapy system</D><D>4438</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5300<D>Medical neutron radiation therapy system</D><D>4438</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5700<D>Remote controlled radionuclide applicator system</D><D>4439</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5710<D>Radiation therapy beam shaping block</D><D>4439</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5730<D>Radionuclide brachytherapy source</D><D>4440</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5750<D>Radionuclide teletherapy system</D><D>4440</D></ITAG></ITAG>FDA disagrees with the comments for the reasons given in paragraph 1b.See also the discussion at the beginning of this preamble under ``B.

Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposed regulations forthe 11 devices listed above with minor clarifying changes.5. Yet more comments requested that FDA classify the 14 devices listedbelow into class I instead of class II as proposed, arguing that theseelectrically powered devices do not present a significant risk to healthfrom electrical shock.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p8,8/9,i1,xs36,r50</C> <H1>Section No.</H1><H1>Device</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1170 <D>Bone densitometer.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1200 <D>Emission computed tomography system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1220 <D>Fluorescent scanner.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1310 <D>Nuclear tomography system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1540 <D>Nonfetal ultrasonic monitor.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1550 <D>Ultrasonic pulsed doppler imaging system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1560 <D>Ultrasonic pulsed echo imaging system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1570 <D>Diagnostic ultrasonic transducer.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1620 <D>Cine or spot fluorographic X-ray camera.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1630 <D>Electrostatic X-ray imaging system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1640 <D>Radiologic film marking X-ray system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1770 <D>Diagnostic X-ray tube mount.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1820 <D>Pneumoencephalographic chair.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5700 <D>Remote controlled radionuclide applicator system.</D></ITAG></ITAG>FDA believes that 13 of the devices listed above present risks to healthin addition to the risk of electrical shock that require establishmentof performance standards. Except for the radiologic film marking X-raysystem (andSection; 892.1640), FDA believes that all of the devices listedabove are intended for use during application of radiation to the bodyfor diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. FDA believes that performance standardsunder section 514 of the act are necessary to control the risks to healthpresented by these devices. FDA also believes that sufficient informationis available to establish such standards.In the case of the radiologic film marking X-ray system (andSection; 892.1640),FDA is not aware of any currently marketed system which uses other thana visible light source to place identification information on X-ray film.Thus, the radiation risk to health identified by the panel no longer exists.Accordingly, FDA is postponing classification of the device, as it presentsonly the risk of electrical shock. The agency will repropose to classifythis device as the radiologic film marking system with clarifying changesin its identification. See ``D. Devices Not Being Classified at This Time.''However, FDA is adopting the proposed regulations for the 13 other deviceslisted above with minor clarifying changes.6. Some other comments requested that FDA classify the two devices namedbelow into class I instead of class II as proposed, because, the commentssaid, classification into class II would inhibit the development of newphantoms by increasing development costs: andSection; 892.1370 <T3>Nuclear anthropomorphic phantom </T3>and andSection; 892.1420 <T3>Radionuclide test pattern phantom.</T3>As to the comments' request that the two devices be in class I, FDA agreesbut not for the reasons given by the comments. (See paragraphs 1g and 3a.)7. Some comments requested that FDA classify the three devices listed belowinto class I instead of class II as proposed, arguing that the RCHSA performancestandard (21 CFR 1020.30 through 1020.33) and the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration's (OSHA) standards regarding safety in the workplaceprovide adequate regulatory control of the safety of the devices. The commentssaid that section 514 standards for the three devices would be unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p8,8/9,i1,xs36,r50</C> <H1>Section No.</H1><H1>Device</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5840 <D>Radiation therapy simulation system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5900 <D>X-ray radiation therapy system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.5930 <D>Therapeutic X-ray tube housing assembly.</D></ITAG></ITAG>FDA disagrees with the comments. FDA has recognized the importance of thesafety and effectiveness of the radiation therapy simulation system andhas amended the diagnostic X-ray equipment performance standard specificallyto exclude this device from radiation safety performance requirements thatare inappropriate or that would hamper the effectiveness of this device.The accuracy of the simulation, which includes accurate positioning, determinesthe effectiveness of the subsequent therapy, which was the concern of thePanel. Improper function of this device may result in excessive patientexposure and tissue damage. The comment mistakenly states that the RCHSAstandard addresses this risk. The RCHSA performance standard at 21 CFR1020.30 through 1020.33 does apply to a radiation therapy simulation system,but this standard only addresses radiation safety and does not assure thatthe radiation therapy simulation system is safe and effective for its intendeduses. FDA believes that a performance standard under section 514 of theact is necessary for the radiation therapy simulation system. The RCHSA performance standard does not apply to the other two devicesnamed above: The X-ray radiation therapy system and the therapeutic X-raytube housing assembly. Further, the OSHA standards do not control the safetyand effectiveness of the three devices regarding application of radiationto patients. For these reasons, FDA believes that a performance standardunder section 514 of the act is necessary for each of the three devicesto provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of thedevices and to control the risk to health of excessive radiation from improperfunction presented by the devices. FDA believes that sufficient informationis available to establish such performance standards. Accordingly, FDAis adopting the proposed regulations for the three devices listed abovewith minor clarifying changes. 8. A comment said that the radionuclide dose calibrator (andSection; 892.1360)is not a medical device and should not be classified. FDA disagrees with the comment. FDA believes that the radionuclide dosecalibrator meets the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the act(21 U.S.C. 321(h)), because it is intended for medical purposes. Radionuclidedose calibrators are used to determine the dosage strength of a radionuclidebefore the radionuclide is administered to a patient. Therefore, a radionuclidedose calibrator is a component, part, or accessory to a medical deviceand is, thus, itself a device as defined by section 201(h) of the act.Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposed regulation for the radionuclidedose calibrator with minor clarifying changes. 9. A comment requested that FDA classify the nuclear anthropomorphic phantominto class I instead of class II as proposed, because many different versionsof the device are being used, and the device is intended for use with otherdevices that emit radiation throughout a large range of frequencies. Unlike the comment, FDA believes that it would be possible to establisha performance standard for the device under section 514 of the act. However,FDA has decided that such a standard would be unnecessary. FDA is classifyingthe device into class I rather than class II, for the reasons providedin paragraph 3a.  10. Section 892.1480; Liquid crystal thermographic system_non-AC-poweredand AC-powered. If the device is intended for adjunctive use in diagnostic screening fordetection of breast cancer or other uses, FDA proposed that the devicebe classified as follows: If non-AC-powered, class I; if AC-powered, classII. If the device (non-AC-powered or AC-powered) is intended for use alonein diagnostic screening for detection of breast cancer, FDA proposed thatthe device be classified into class III.10a. Some comments requested that (1) the non-AC-powered device be classifiedinto class I as proposed if it is used in diagnostic evaluations as anadjunct to other clinically accepted techniques and (2) the non-AC-powereddevice be classified into class II instead of class III as proposed ifit is used alone in diagnostic evaluations. These comments gave no reasonsfor the suggested change in classification. FDA agrees that the general controls of class I by themselves would providereasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the non-AC-poweredliquid crystal thermographic system if the device is intended for diagnosticuse as an adjunct to other generally accepted diagnostic procedures. Thus,FDA agrees that the device should be placed in class I if it is intendedfor adjunctive diagnostic use for various conditions or uses, e.g., inthe diagnosis of breast cancer if the device is intended as an adjunctto clinical physical examinations including breast palpation and X-raymammography. However, FDA disagrees that the non-AC-powered liquid crystal thermographicsystem should be classified into class II if it is intended as a sole diagnostictool (including screening tool) for diagnosis of breast cancer and otherdiseases. If the device is intended to be used as a sole diagnostic tool,FDA believes that the device cannot be classified as a class II devicebecause there is insufficient information for the establishment of performancestandards to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectivenessof the device. 10b. One comment suggested that FDA not classify the liquid crystal thermographicsystem in Part 892 with radiology devices because the device does not emitradiation. FDA agrees that, for the reason given in the comment, the device shouldnot be codified in Part 892. In this final rule, FDA is codifying the classificationof certain versions of the device in 21 CFR Part 884_Obstetrical and GynecologicalDevices (andSection; 884.2982). FDA also is postponing classification ofthe AC-powered version of the liquid crystal thermographic system intendedfor certain uses. See ``D. Devices Not Being Classified At This Time.''When FDA classifies the proposed but postponed versions of the device,the agency will codify its classification in Part 884 using the same docketnumber. 10c. Comments said that the risk to health of electrical shock is not asignificant risk for the AC-powered device. These comments said that theAC-powered and non-AC-powered versions of the device should be placed inclass I because no meaningful differences in risks to health exist betweenthe non-AC-powered and AC-powered versions of the device. FDA tentatively agrees that it is unnecessary to establish performancestandards under section 514 of the act to control the risk to health ofelectrical shock presented by the AC-powered version of the liquid crystalthermographic system intended for certain adjunctive uses. Thus, FDA ispostponing classification of the AC-powered version of the device if itis intended for certain uses, and the agency is considering classifyingthe device intended for these uses into class I. See ``D. Devices Not BeingClassified At this Time.'' For the reasons provided below, FDA disagreesthat the proposed device should be classified into class I for all intendeduses. 10d. Several comments stated that the efficacy of thermography in earlydetection of breast cancer can be significantly influenced by the degreeof expertise and experience of the users. These comments said that thedevice should be in class I because the skill of the users assured safeand effective performance of the device. FDA disagrees with the comments. Under the statute, FDA classifies devicesbased on attributes of the devices, including adequacy of labeling fortheir intended uses. Although user skill may enhance results obtained foruse of a device, in determining the safety and effectiveness of a devicefor purposes of classification, FDA assumes that the users possess averageskills. 10e. One comment requested that FDA classify both the non-AC-powered andthe AC-powered versions of the liquid crystal thermographic system intoclass I for all intended uses instead of into class I, class II, or classIII as proposed, depending upon certain intended uses of the device. Thecomment said that classification of the device, if it is intended for useas the only screening tool in the early detection of breast cancer, intoclass III would essentially eliminate its use.FDA disagrees with the comment. Classification of a preamendments deviceinto class II or class III under section 513 (c) and (d) of the act (21U.S.C. 360c (c) and (d)) has no immediate impact on the commercial availabilityof the device. For each device classified into class II or class III underthese sections of the act, FDA must publish an additional proposed andfinal regulation allowing further public comment before the agency canestablish a performance standard (21 U.S.C. 360d) or require premarketapproval (21 U.S.C. 360e) for the device. See the discussion later in thispreamble entitled ``N. Economic Impact.'' Further, the essential purposeof the classification procedures provided by Congress is to provide reasonableassurance of the safety and effectiveness of devices. Continued commercialavailability of devices is not one of the criteria that FDA may considerwhen classifying devices.10f. Some comments recommended that the liquid crystal thermographic systemintended for consumer use, whether over-the-counter or prescription, beclassified into class III. FDA agrees with the comment. The agency is unaware that anyone has evermarketed the liquid crystal thermographic system for diagnostic use byconsumers. If such a device were considered for marketing for diagnosticuse by consumers, it would not be substantially equivalent to the preamendmentsdevice subject to the proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, FDA believes thata liquid crystal thermographic system intended for diagnostic use by consumerswould be a new, not substantially equivalent device, classified by statuteinto class III. Further, before testing a liquid crystal thermographicsystem with such new intended uses on humans for purposes of gatheringdata to submit to FDA to obtain premarket approval, manufacturers shouldobtain from FDA an investigational device exemption for the device as specifiedin 21 CFR Part 812.10g. Other comments indicated that FDA's statements in the proposed regulationsabout the unacceptably high levels of false-negative and false-positiveresults from using the liquid crystal thermographic system for diagnosingbreast cancer were not accurate. One comment said that the false-negativerate for breast cancer detection using thermography is less than the false-negativerate using X-ray mammography. Another comment said that the high false-positiverate for breast cancer detection using thermography is of greater significancethan the false-negative rate.Some comments stated that the device should be in class I instead of classIII when it is intended only for screening and detection of breast cancer.The comments stated that there is adequate evidence to show the safetyand effectiveness of the device for this intended use. The comments submitted(or cited) a number of published studies to support their requests thatthe device be in class I.FDA acknowledges the importance of both the false-negative and the false-positiverates when evaluating the efficacy of any cancer detection method. FDAis concerned that (1) based upon a false-negative thermogram, a woman maynot seek proper medical attention, and (2) a false-positive result maycause a woman to lose faith in medicine and not participate in furtherroutine clinical screening programs for cancer. Therefore, both the false-negativeand the false-positive rates are important in evaluating the safety andeffectiveness of thermographic devices. FDA has reviewed the data submittedand cited by the comments and other data and available information andhas observed no scientific consensus regarding the safety and effectivenessof thermography when used alone in diagnosis of cancer. Based upon availabledata, FDA believes that thermography in the detection of breast canceris appropriate only as an adjunct to other clinically accepted independentscreening techniques, i.e., a clinical physical examination including palpationand X-ray mammography. Thermography may be useful to detect breast temperaturevariations which may be indicative of abnormalities. But its effectiveness,when used alone in the specific detection of breast cancer, has not beendemonstrated.To summarize, FDA is adopting the proposed regulation for the nonelectricallypowered liquid crystal thermographic system intended for adjunctive usein diagnostic screening for detection of breast cancer or other diagnosticuses without a change in classification of the device from that proposed.Although FDA tentatively agrees that the AC-powered version of the liquidcrystal thermographic system should be placed in class I if it is intendedfor adjunctive diagnostic use, for the reasons given above in paragraph10c, FDA is postponing classification of the AC-powered version of thedevice if it is intended for adjunctive diagnostic use.FDA believes that there is insufficient information to determine whetheror not the general controls of class I by themselves are sufficient toprovide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the non-AC-poweredor AC-powered liquid crystal thermographic system intended for use as thesole diagnostic tool in screening for breast cancer or other conditionsand that insufficient information exists for the establishment of performancestandards to provide such assurance. FDA believes that this device, whenused as the only screening tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer or otherconditions, is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of humanhealth. Because of the potential for high levels of false-negative andfalse-positive test results, the device presents a potential unreasonablerisk of illness or injury. Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposed regulationclassifying the nonelectrically powered and the electrically powered liquidcrystal thermographic system intended as the only screening tool for thediagnosis of breast cancer or other conditions into class III with clarifyingchange in the identification of the device. 10h. FDA recognizes that the liquid crystal thermographic system is beingcommercially distributed for use in a wide range of diagnostic applicationswhere variations in skin temperature may occur, such as (a) peripheralvascular disease, (b) musculoskeletal disorders, (c) extracranial cerebralvascular disease, (d) abnormalities of the thyroid gland, and (e) variousneoplastic and inflammatory conditions. FDA believes that the liquid crystalthermographic system (non-AC-powered and AC-powered) intended for adjunctiveuse in diagnostic screening for breast cancer or other uses is a preamendmentsdevice. FDA believes that this preamendments device, if intended for useas the sole screening tool in diagnostic screening for breast cancer orother uses, has been substantially altered and has undergone a major changeor modification of its intended use (see 21 CFR 807.85) and is not substantiallyequivalent to the liquid crystal thermographic system in commercial distributionon the enactment date of the amendments.Because FDA believes that the liquid crystal thermographic system is beingcommercially distributed while intended for a new use, i.e., use unaidedin diagnostic screening, FDA is codifying the statutory classificationof the new device into class III for such new use. See andSection; 884.3(b).Accordingly, the regulation classifying this class III device states that,as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, an approval undersection 515 of the act is required before this device may be commerciallydistributed. 11. Section 892.1450; Telethermographic System_AC-powered. If the device is intended for adjunctive use in diagnostic screening fordetection of breast cancer, FDA proposed that the device be classifiedin class II. If the device is intended for use alone in diagnostic screeningfor detection of breast cancer, FDA proposed that the device be classifiedin class III.11a. One comment suggested that FDA not classify the telethermographicsystem in Part 892 with radiology devices because the device does not emitradiation.FDA agrees that, for the reason given in the comment, the device shouldnot be codified in Part 892. In this final rule, FDA is codifying the classificationof one version of the proposed device in 21 CFR Part 884_Obstetrical andGynecological Devices (andSection; 884.2980). FDA also is postponing classificationof the telethermographic system intended for certain uses. See ``D. DevicesNot Being Classified At This Time.'' When FDA classifies the proposed butpostponed version of the device, the agency will codify its classificationin Part 884 using the same docket number.11b. Some comments on the proposed regulation said that the device shouldbe placed in class I for all intended uses, because the risk to healthof electric shock is not a significant risk for this device. FDA tentatively agrees that it is unnecessary to establish performancestandards under section 514 of the act to control the risk to health ofelectric shock presented by the telethermographic system. Thus, FDA ispostponing classification of the telethermographic system, if the deviceis intended for certain uses, and the agency is considering classifyingthe device intended for these uses into class I. See ``D. Devices Not BeingClassified At This Time.'' For the reasons provided below, FDA disagreesthat the proposed device should be classified into class I for all intendeduses.11c. Several comments stated that the efficacy of thermography in earlydetection of breast cancer can be significantly influenced by the degreeof expertise and experience of the users. These comments said that thedevice should be in class I because the skill of the users assured safeand effective performance of the device.FDA disagrees with the comments. Under the statute, FDA classifies a devicebased on attributes of the device, including adequacy of labeling for itsintended uses. Although user skill may enhance results obtained from useof a device, in determining the safety and effectiveness of a device forpurposes of classification, FDA assumes that users possess average skills.11d. One comment requested that FDA classify the telethermographic systeminto class I for all intended uses instead of into class II or class IIIas proposed, depending upon certain intended uses of the device. The commentsaid that classification of the device into class III if it is intendedfor use as the only screening tool in the early detection of breast cancerwould essentially eliminate its use. FDA disagrees with the comment. Classification of a preamendments deviceinto class II or class III under section 513 (c) and (d) of the act hasno immediate impact on the commercial availability of the device. For eachdevice classified into class II or class III under this section of theact, FDA must publish and additional proposed and final regulation allowingfurther public comment before the agency can establish a performance standard(21 U.S.C. 360d) or require premarket approval (21 U.S.C. 360e) for thedevice. See the discussion later in this preamble entitled ``N. EconomicImpact.'' Further, the essential purpose of the classification proceduresprovided by Congress is to provide reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of the devices. Continued commerical availability of devicesis not one of the criteria that FDA may consider when classifying devices.11e. Some comments recommended that the telethermographic system intendedfor consumer use, whether over-the-counter or prescription, be classifiedinto class III.FDA agrees with the comment. The agency believes that the telethermographicsystem intended for diagnostic use by consumers has never been marketedand that, if the device is intended for diagnostic use by consumers, itwould not be substantially equivalent to the preamendments device subjectto the proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, FDA believes that a telethermographicsystem intended for diagnostic use by consumers would be a new significantrisk device. Before testing a telethermographic device with such new intendeduses on humans for purposes of gathering data to submit to FDA to obtainpremarket approval, manufacturers should obtain from FDA an investigationaldevice exemption for the device as specified in 21 CFR Part 812. 11f. Other comments indicated that FDA's statements in the proposed regulationsabout the unacceptably high levels of false-negative and false-positiveresults from using the telethermographic system for diagnosing breast cancerwere not accurate. One comment said that the false-negative rate for breastcancer detection using thermography is less than the false-negative rateusing X-ray mammography. Another comment said that the high false-positiverate for breast cancer detection using thermography is of greater significancethan the false-negative rate.Some comments stated that the device should be in class I instead of classIII when it is intended only for screening and detection of breast cancer.The comments stated that adequate evidence exists to show the safety andeffectiveness of the device for this intended use.

FDAis concerned that (1) based upon a false-negative thermogram, a woman maynot seek proper medical attention, and (2) a false-positive result maycause a woman to lose faith in medicine and not participate in furtherroutine clinical screening programs for cancer. Therefore, both the false-negativeand the false-positive rates are important in evaluating the safety andeffectiveness of thermographic devices. FDA has reviewed the data submittedand cited by the comments and other data and information available andhas observed a lack of scientific consensus regarding the safety and effectivenessof thermography when used along in diagnosis of cancer. Based upon availabledata, FDA believes that thermography in the detection of breast canceris appropriate only as an adjunct to other clinically accepted independentscreening techniques, i.e., a clinical physical examination including palpationand X-ray mammography. Thermography may be useful to detect breast temperaturevariations which may be indicative of abnormalities. Thermography's effectiveness,when used alone in the specific detection of breast cancer, has not beendemonstrated.To summarize, although FDA tentatively agrees that the telethermographicsystem should be placed in class I if it is intended for adjuctive diagnosticuse, for the reasons given above in paragraph 11b, FDA is postponing classificationof the device if it is intended for adjunctive diagnostic use. Further,FDA believes that there is insufficient information to determine whetheror not the general controls of class I by themselves are sufficient toprovide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the telethermographicsystem intended for use as the sole diagnostic tool in screening for breastcancer or other conditions and that insufficient information exists forthe establishment of performance standards to provide such assurance. FDAbelieves that this device, when used as the only screening tool for thediagnosis of breast cancer or other conditions, is of substantial importancein preventing impairment of human health. Because of the potential forhigh levels of false-negative and false-positive test results, the devicepresents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Accordingly,FDA is adopting the proposed regulation classifying the telethermographicsystem intended as the only screening tool for the diagnosis of breastcancer or other conditions into class III with clarifying changes in theidentification of the device.11g. FDA recognizes that the telethermographic system is being commerciallydistributed for use in a wide range of diagnostic applications where variationsin skin temperature may occur, such as (a) peripheral vascular disease,(b) musculoskeletal disorders, (c) extracranial cerebral vascular disease,(d) abnormalities of the thyroid gland, and (e) various neoplastic andinflammatory conditions. FDA believes that the telethermographic systemintended for adjunctive use in diagnostic screening for breast cancer orother uses is a preamendments device. FDA believes that this preamendmentsdevice, if intended for use as the sole tool in diagnostic screening forbreast cancer or other uses, has been substantially altered and has undergonea major change or modification of its intended use (see 21 CFR 807.85)and is not substantially equivalent to the telethermographic system incommercial distribution on the enactment date of the amendments.Because FDA believes that the telethermographic system is being commerciallydistributed while intended for a new use, i.e., used unaided in diagnosticscreening, FDA is codifying the statutory classification of the new deviceinto class III for such new use. See andSection; 884.3(b). Accordingly, theregulation classifying this class III device states that, as of the enactmentdate of the amendments, May 28, 1976, an approval under section 515 ofthe act is required before this device may be commercially distributed.12. Section 892.1820; Pneumoencephalographic chair; proposed class II.A comment on the proposed regulation requested that FDA classify the deviceinto class I instead of class II, arguing that the adjustment of the tensionof the restraint straps to prevent constriction of the patient's bloodvessels is under control of the medical staff while the device is in useand that structural or control mechanism failure is not a significant hazardfor this device.FDA believes that, whether or not the comment is correct, the agency mustclassify the device into class II because the Panel cited additional risksto health, i.e., electromechanical malfunction or difficulties in administeringcontrast agents, in addition to the risk of vascular constriction. FDAbelieves that the identified risks would be minimized by establishing aperformance standard for the device and that general controls alone areinsufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectivenessof the device. The agency also believes that sufficient information isavailable to develop a performance standard for the device. Accordingly,FDA is adopting the proposed regulation classifying the pneumoencephalographicchair with minor clarifying changes.13. Section 892.1850; Radiographic film cassette; proposed class II.Some comments on the proposed regulation requested that FDA classify thedevice into class I instead of class II as proposed, arguing that the riskto health of misdiagnosis from poor contact of the radiographic film withthe intensifying screen would be minimized if the user of the device employedreadily available quality assurance tests.FDA disagrees with the comments. Data collected by FDA indicate that significantdifferences in patient exposure can result from the choice of cassetteused in a radiographic examination (Refs. 1 and 3). The aluminum equivalenceof cassette front panels range from 0.06 to 1.7 millimeters. These thicknessesresult in X-ray transmissions ranging from 98 to 61 percent of the incidentbeam and a worst-case difference in exposure to the patient of 1 to 1.6.In addition to direct exposure differences, the differences between cassettescan result in degradation of image quality and increased repeat rates.The agency believes that this information provides both a basis for anddata to support development of a standard for the device. Accordingly,FDA is adopting the proposed regulation for the radiographic film cassettewith a minor clarifying change.14. Section 892.5770; Powered radiation therapy patient support assembly;proposed class II.A comment on the proposed regulation requested that FDA classify the deviceinto class I instead of class II, arguing that the risk to patients fromfailure of the device's structural integrity or control mechanism is nota significant risk.FDA disagrees with the comment. FDA has received reports of patients beinginjured due to failures of this device. FDA believes that a performancestandard is necessary for the powered radiation therapy patient supportassembly to control the risk to patients' health from trauma resultingfrom failure of the structural or control mechanisms of the device. FDAalso believes that sufficient information is available to develop a performancestandard for the device. The agency further believes that general controlsalone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of the device. Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposedregulation for the powered radiation therapy patient support assembly witha minor clarifying change.15. Section 892.6500; Personnel protective shield; proposed class II.Some comments on the proposed regulation requested that FDA classify thedevice into class I instead of class II, arguing that performance standardsare unnecessary to control the risk to health of excessive radiation exposureof patients from improper function of the device. The comments said thatexposure to unnecessary radiation is a potential hazard but that unnecessaryradiation exposure is unlikely to result from improper functioning of thedevice. The comments further stated that manufacturers' adherence to therequirements of the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulationsand testing by users before acceptance of the devices would provide a reasonableassurance of the safety and effectiveness of the personnel protective shield.One comment argued that the establishment of performance standards forall of the various kinds of shields encompassed in this generic type ofdevice would not be cost effective.FDA agrees with the comments. The general controls of class I alone forthe personnel protective shield, particularly the requirements of the CGMPregulations in 21 CFR Part 820, would provide reasonable assurance of thesafety and effectiveness of the device. The personnel protective shieldis intended to protect the patient, the operator of radiation emittingmedical devices, or other persons from any unnecessary radiation. The amountof shielding required varies (a) with the levels of radiation emitted,and (b) with the distance between the radiation source and the person beingprotected. FDA believes that users of radiation-emitting devices are essentiallyresponsible for the amount and placement of shielding needed to preventunnecessary or excessive radiation exposure from these devices. FDA nowbelieves that the general controls of class I would provide reasonableassurance that the personnel protective shield is constructed properlyand that it is unnecessary to establish performance standards for the deviceunder section 514 of the act. Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposedregulation for the personnel protective shield with a change in classificationfrom class II to class I and minor clarifying changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">H. Exemptions For Class I Devices</ITAG>16. The various panels reviewing radiology devices recommended that FDAexempt the five radiology devices listed below from certain requirementsof the act. In the preamble to the proposed regulations, the agency providedits reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with the panels' recommendationsregarding exemptions (47 FR 4406 at 4410 and 4436).In response to the panels' recommendations, FDA proposed that the firstfour radiology devices listed below be exempt from most requirements ofthe CGMP regulations (21 CFR Part 820) and the requirement of premarketnotification (section 510(k) of the act and Subpart E of 21 CFR Part 807).FDA proposed to classify the radiographic intensifying screen into classI with no exemptions.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p8,8/9,xs50,r10</C> <H1>Section No. </H1><H1>Device</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1840<D>Radiographic film.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1920 <D>Radiographic head holder.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1940 <D>Radiologic quality assurance instrument.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1950 <D>Radiographic anthropomorphic phantom.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">892.1960 <D>Radiographic intensifying screen.</D></ITAG></ITAG>However, as stated in the proposed rule, the agency has determined thatexemption of manufacturers of any device from andSection;andSection; 820.180and 820.198 of the CGMP regulations would not be in the public interest.Moreover, compliance with these sections is not unduly burdensome for devicemanufacturers. The complaint file requirements of andSection; 820.198 ensurethat device manufacturers have adequate systems for complaint investigationand followup. The general requirements in andSection; 820.180 concerningrecords ensure that FDA has access to complaint files, can investigatedevice-related injury reports and complaints about product defects, candetermine whether the manufacturer's corrective actions are adequate, andcan determine whether an exemption from other sections of the CGMP regulations,if one has been granted, is still appropriate.FDA has determined that no device that is labeled or otherwise representedas sterile will be exempted from the device CGMP regulations. A steriledevice must be subject to all of the CGMP regulations to ensure that manufacturersadequately reduce the bioburden (number of microorganisms) on the deviceand its components during manufacturing processes. This reduction is accomplishedthrough adherence to a comprehensive quality assurance program, as is requiredby the CGMP regulations, including adequate environmental controls, trainedpersonnel, appropriate maintenance and calibration of sterilization equipment,recordkeeping concerning lot sterility, strict packaging and labeling controls,and other quality assurance measures.16a. Exemptions from CGMP regulations.Many general comments on the proposed regulations for radiology devicesrequested that the agency grant all of the exemptions that the panels hadrecommended.FDA agrees that it should grant to the manufacturers of three of the fiveradiology devices listed in paragraph 16 above an exemption from most requirementsof the CGMP regulations, as FDA proposed (andSection;andSection; 892.1920,892.1940, and 892.1950).FDA disagrees that the agency should grant to manufacturers of the radiographicintensifying screen an exemption from the CGMP regulations. FDA believesthat, in order to control the risks to health that may result from unnecessaryradiation exposure from repreated radiographs or loss of diagnostic informationdue to the use of a substandard product and thereby to provide reasonableassurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, this device shouldbe subject to all of the requirements of the CGMP regulations.FDA now believes that radiographic film should not be exempt from CGMPrequirements because of wide variations in the amount of X-rays transmittedto patients and in the image quality produced by various types of filmwhich is affected by the manufacturing process.Accordingly, FDA is adopting the proposed regulations classifying the radiographichead holder, radiologic quality assurance instrument, and radiographicanthropomorphic phantom into class I with the exemptions from CGMP thatwere proposed.16b. Exemptions from premarket notification procedures.Many comments requested that FDA grant the exemptions from premarket notificationprocedures in section 510(k) of the act and Subpart E of 21 CFR Part 807that the panels had recommended.In this final rule, FDA is granting the exemption from the requirementof premarket notification for manufacturers of each of the four radiologydevices that were proposed (andSection;andSection; 892.1840, 892.1920, 892.1940,and 892.1950). Elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, FDA is proposing to grant an exemption fromthe requirement of premarket notification for six additional class I radiologydevices. In that proposed rule, FDA explains its recently developed policyon granting such exemptions.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Minor Changes or Clarifications</ITAG>Occasionally, the agency has made minor changes in the name of a generictype of device or its identification to clarify the final regulation. Also,the agency is adding new andSection;andSection; 884.3 and 892.3 in SubpartA of each part to explain the various effective dates for premarket approvalrequirements for devices classified into class III. FDA also is addinga new paragraph in the classification regulation for each device classifiedinto class III to declare, where applicable, the effective date of premarketapproval requirements for the device.<ITAG tagnum="85">J.

A manufacturer who submits a premarket notification submissionfor a device under Part 807 cannot show merely that the device is accuratelydescribed by the section title and identification provision of a regulationin this part but shall state why the device is substantially equivalentto other devices, as required by andSection; 807.87.(c) To avoid duplicative listings, a radiology device that has two or moretypes of uses (e.g., use both as a diagnostic device and a therapeuticdevice) is listed in one subpart only.(d) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of FederalRegulations are to Chapter I of this Title 21, unless otherwise noted.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 892.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.</ITAG>A device included in this part that is classified into class III (premarketapproval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown inthe regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approvalunder section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted undersection 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the actconsists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarketapproval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product developmentprotocol (PDP) for the device.(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before theenactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantiallyequivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act,FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiringsuch approval, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Sucha regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective duringthe grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on thelast day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifiesthe device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirementfor premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classifiedinto class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributedwithout FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completeda PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b)of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A)of the act applies to the device.(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercialdistribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketedthat has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA musthave issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for thedevice before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified.If FDA knows that a device being commerically distributed may be a ``new''device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or otherreasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device intoclass III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a classIII device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the actbefore commercial distribution.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Diagnostic Devices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 892.1170</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Bone densitometer.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Identification.</T3> A bone densitometer is a device intended for medicalpurposes to measure bone density and mineral content by X-ray or gammaray transmission measurements through the bone and adjacent tissues.
