The eight branches of MerchantsBank will reopen today asoffices of Bank of Boston Corp., the state's largestcommercial bank. Bank of Boston said it paid the FDIC $7million for MerchantsBank's $340 million in deposits.</LP><TEXT>   The failure of MerchantsBank, a Massachusetts-charteredcooperative bank, marks the second insolvency at aBoston-area financial institution in the past three weeks.Late last month, federal thrift regulators took control ofHome Owners Savings Bank in Burlington, Mass.   Douglas Clark, the FDIC official put in charge ofMerchantsBank after Massachusetts regulators declared thebank insolvent Friday afternoon, said the agency will selloff the bank's assets. Mr. Clark said recent financialstatements indicate MerchantsBank had negative net worth ofabout $11.3 million. But he said agency officials must nowre-examine the value of the assets, comprised mainly of realestate loans. &quot;I suspect the {ultimate} loss will be greaterthan $11.3 million,&quot; Mr. Clark said.   Mr. Clark and Andrew Calamare, Massachusetts commissionerof banks, said MerchantsBank represented substantially all ofthe assets of Merchants Capital.   John Lakian, chairman and largest shareholder of MerchantsCapital, couldn't be reached to comment on the governmentaction, which came after the close of stock market trading onFriday.   MerchantsBank stock, which has barely traded in recentweeks, remained at six cents a share Friday on the nationalover-the-counter market.
