The key index of 30 premier stocks slid 37.80 points to1,965.85, its lowest closing level since it closed at 1,961.54 onFeb. 11. Most of the slippage occurred early in the session.   Losing issues outstripped gainers by about 7-to-1 on the NewYork Stock Exchange, with 1,363 issues declining, 238 advancing and367 unchanged.   Big Board volume totaled 176.72 million shares, up from 131.2million Tuesday.   Wall Street's fear of higher interest rates were aggravated byan announcement from big banks that they had raised their key primelending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, the first rise sincethe October crash.   Hauntingly similar jitters about rising interest rates were abig factor behind the crash _ and those memories are still fresh inthe minds of nervous investors.   In addition, higher interest rates, by raising the cost ofborrowing, tend to dampen companies' expansion plans andinvestments.   ``The major problem with the stock market has been the rise inrates,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first big bank to raise the keyrate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a baserate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, includingsome types of mortgages.   ``It clearly hit a raw nerve ... this market was clearlyvulnerable,'' said Monte Gordon, vice president and director ofresearch for Dreyfus Corp.   The hike in the prime came against a background of growingedginess about the outlook for interest rates.   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson reportedlysuggested that there could be an internationally coordinated boostin rates.   Lawson, who was quoted in an interview with the Wall StreetJournal's overseas edition Wednesday, noted that a coordinatedeffort by West Germany, Japan and other leading nations to hikeinterest rates ``is certainly possible'' following the FederalReserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S. inflation.   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed thatthe Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks.
