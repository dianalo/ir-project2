Smith, directorof the Automated Systems Division, who came to the FTC last April.andP;  Thedocument transfer software lets FTC lawyers send documents to other PCworkstations on the LAN or to the Prime network print server, to which asmany as 100 printers are attached, she said.andM;&quot;When lawyers come on board at the FTC, it's really a very tidy set ofcapabilities they have.andP;  Once they get their feet on the ground in their workand they can start using these capabilities, they really have a lot of nicetools through automation here at the agency,&quot; Smith said.andM;Automatic Phone MailandM;The E-mail and phone mail systems complement each other, she added.andP;  Butoverall, E-mail has had a less dramatic effect on the way the FTC's lawyersand administrative officials conduct their business than PBX/phone mail has,Proctor said.andP;  Phone mail &quot;is easier, faster and more convenient for mostpeople.&quot;andM;Proctor's Rolm 400 desktop machine, for example, has a digital display thattells him who within the FTC is calling on the system and who is beingcalled.andP;  After three rings, his phone is configured to switch automaticallyto the phone mail option, or voice mailbox.andP;  Callers can leave up tofour-minute messages.andM;FTC personnel also use phone mail for sending a message to several people atonce.andP;  Proctor's phone, for example, is set up to distribute voice messagesto a list of voice mailbox extensions, in much the same way that E-mailmessages are distributed.andM;&quot;Typically, it takes a long time for important information from the GeneralServices Administration to filter out,&quot; and phone mail helps the FTC toovercome that problem, he said.andM;Another feature of PBX/phone mail that Proctor is eager to use more is theguest mailbox facility.andP;  The FTC Rolm system administrator can set up guestmailboxes for people in other agencies, whose only requirement is aTouch-Tone phone.andP;  Instead of a physical extension, guests are assigned alogical number that gives them all the features of a phone mail extension,once they access it by dialing into FTC's main Rolm switch.andM;&quot;We're really just at the very beginning of using it for this application,&quot;Proctor said.andP;  But it holds the promise of improving his contacts with otheragency officials.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
