The political leaders arriving here this weekend come fromeconomies undergoing widely divergent pressures. As a result,economists expect that a common perception of the world'seconomic problems -- let alone an agreed-to approach tosolutions -- will be elusive.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're farther away from each other than we thought we'dbe a few years ago,&quot; says Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. economist PaulJackson, adding that he expects a &quot;bland communique&quot;endorsing a few broadly defined economic virtues. Indeed,this year's summit will be less a meeting of a close-knitclub than a reunion of far-flung friends telling one anotherof separate perils and adventures.   The Group of Seven consists of the U.S., Germany, Japan,France, Britain, Italy and Canada. A look at the economiccircumstances among the seven nations explains why attitudeswould differ on matters such as how to balance the promotionof economic growth and the fighting of inflation.   The U.S. sees the glimmer of an economic recovery at homeand wants the rest of the world to join in a campaign toensure that it's robust and durable. Britain, which hassuffered the deepest recession of any of the summit seven, isstill looking for signs of hope. Germany, which is pouringmarks into the reconstruction of its crumbling eastern wing,isn't worried about economic growth but has a growing dreadof inflation.   Apart from purely economic matters, the summit seven comewith separate attitudes toward the most pressing question onthe agenda -- how to prevent economic disintegration in theSoviet Union. Here, geography is all-important. NearbyGermany and France are pressing for concrete promises ofWestern aid. Distant America and Japan want the troublednation to restructure itself first.   The divergence is understandable. Mayhem in the SovietUnion translates to immigrants and instability in Europe,particularly Germany, which will accept all ethnic Germanswho want to move and which remains host to more than 300,000Soviet troops.   The greatest split in economics and attitudes is betweenthe U.S. and Germany. According to David Mulford, AmericanTreasury undersecretary for international affairs, &quot;we havesubstantially overcome the inflation threat.&quot; As a result, headds, &quot;the summit should emphasize the importance ofsustaining the kind of growth we had for the last ten years.&quot;   By contrast, Germany's future growth will be assured bythe massive restructuring job in the former East Germany.More worrisome to officials in Bonn and Frankfurt is theprospect that inflation will surge along the way. Labor costsand import prices are rising by nearly 5% this year -- thefirst time in a decade both have risen in tandem. Inaddition, the inflationary effects of giving East Germans oneDeutsche mark for every Ost-mark they held may still filterthrough.   Following is a summary of economic conditions in each ofthe seven nations:   The U.S.: Relieved by the conclusion of the Gulf War and aseries of interest rate cuts, America has begun to swing outof its recession. It's also subdued inflationary pressures:Consumer prices rose at annual rate of only 2.8% for thefirst five months of 1991, and economists expect inflation tohover between 2% and 3% for the next several years. Still,U.S. officials fear a puny recovery. High debt levelsthroughout the economy leave companies and consumersreluctant to borrow and banks hesitant to lend. Citing the$300 billion federal deficit, American Express Bank notedthat the debt-to-gross national product ratio in the U.S. isabout 20%, up from 15% during the 1970s. That plus fragilityamong U.S. financial institutions cloud growth prospects.Meanwhile, the dollar has risen 21% against the Europeancurrencies this year, a move central bankers haven't beeninclined to thwart.   The summit host is enduring the most wrenching economicconditions of the seven. Despite government promises ofrecovery in the second half, few signs have emerged. Baseinterest rates of 11% continue to push businesses to fireworkers or shut down. Unemployment is expected to rise forthe next year, possibly passing the three million-personthreshold. Britain's commitment to Europe's exchange-ratemechanism links the pound to the mark at a median rate of2.95 marks, and limits the scope and timing of furtherinterest rate cuts. Political uncertainties about the nextgeneral election have recently shaken the pound, therebyadding to the difficulty of cutting interest rates. The mainpositive trend is that retail inflation is down to 5.8% froman 11% peak last fall.   Doomsayers, including former Thatcher government adviserBill Martin, doubt there'll be a recovery as such. Mr. Martinjust predicted &quot;five years hard labor&quot; for the U.K. economy,with almost no growth -- unless the government realigns thepound in the ERM. That would allow for more British exportsand faster cuts in interest rates. The Major governmentinsists it will stick to current policies.   Germany: Europe's economic engine is central to G-7negotiations but is preoccupied with problems uniquelyGerman. The much-underestimated task of incorporating aravaged eastern wing has turned this traditional supplier ofworld capital into a user of world capital. Germany's publicdeficit will be at least 150 billion marks ($82.7 billion)this year. Interest rates remain high to attract the neededfunds and to keep the spending from overheating the economy.After 4.5% real growth last year, the German engine isslowing to levels of about 2.8% this year.   Inflation is the chief worry. Indirect taxes are rising tohelp pay for the eastern rebuilding, and wage settlementshave been unusually high. The dollar's surge of about 21%against the mark this year makes U.S. imports more costly.Meanwhile the prospect of civil war in Yugoslavia-and moreominously, disintegration in the Soviet Union-would weakenthe mark further. The Bundesbank's response to this mix ofinflationary pressures will be to hold to current interestrates, and if necessary to raise them.   Japan: The economy, which grew at a 5.6% rate last year,is slowing to an estimated growth rate of 3.5% this year andnext. Fixed business investment, which hit a 20-year high ofnearly 20% last year, is slowing also. Although inflation isconsidered to be stable at 2.3%, the central bank isn'texpected soon to repeat last month's cut in the officialdiscount rate. The Bank of Japan remains concerned about arelatively tight labor market and asset price inflation.Japan's much-watched current-account surplus shrank to $35.8billion last year, but is on the rise again. It's expected tocome in a $41 billion this year and $52 billion in 1992,according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment.   The Japanese want the summit to show top-level support forthe trade talks, and extreme caution toward the Soviets.   France: The country may have managed to get by with only afew months of economic stagnation -- no lasting recession ofthe sort the English-speaking economies have suffered. CreditLyonnais predicts that strong export performance will pushoverall economic growth to 2% for this year. Manufacturingoutput picked up in March and April, and business surveyshave indicated greater confidence. In addition, France isexpected to post a lower inflation level than Germany's 4% to4.5% in coming months.   At the summit, the French will support a relativelygenerous attitude toward the Soviets, backing in particularmore liberal Soviet borrowing rights from the European Bankfor Reconstruction and Development. France may balk atanything but the most vague endorsement of the trade talks.Cuts in farm subsidies hurt hundreds of French farmers.   Italy: The Italians may also manage to escape a sharprecession. The OECD predicts that the economy will grow at arate of 1.7% this year, increasing to 2.7% next year.Inflation, stuck at around 7%, remains a problem. Inaddition, the Italian budget deficit is a perennial andmassive problem. Government borrowing is rising to 10.7% ofthe economy this year, from 10.1% in 1990.   Canada: After a year-long recession, with unemploymentrising above 10%, the economy seems to be bottoming out. Theupswing in the U.S., together with improved confidence amongCanadian businesses, are expected to yield improvements inthe second half. Inflation expectations remain a problem inthe economy, though the government is given a fair chance ofmeeting inflation-reduction targets of 3% by the end of 1992and 2% by the end of 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
