He said Chinese officers recently tested a Chinook CH-47Dhelicopter on the Tibetan plateau at more than 15,000 feet high.   A Boeing spokesman in Philadelphia, where the company'shelicopter division is based, said Boeing rented a C-5 cargo planefrom the U.S. Air Force to ship the helicopter to Tibet in earlyAugust.   ``The Chinese interest is very encouraging,'' said companyspokesman Robert Togerson. ``The helicopter met or surpassed theirspecifications.''   The spokesman for the prospective purchaser, Poly TechnologiesInc., which handles weapons deals for the Chinese military, saidChina would decide in September whether to buy the helicopters.   He said the military had so far only considered the Boeing model.   A spokesman for Boeing in Beijing said the helicopters sell forabout $15 million each.   ``If completed it would be one of the largest direct sales ofmilitary goods between the United States and China,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   The largest U.S.-China military contract was signed in August1987 with Grumman Corp., of Bethpage, N.Y., and is worth $245million. The avionics firm contracted to upgrade the electronicssystem of China's F-8 fighter jet.   The Chinese military spokesman, who identified himself only asKang, said China would use the helicopters for military purposes``inside China.''   He said the copters were being considered as part of a programto develop a rapid deployment force for the Chinese military.   The Boeing spokesman in Beijing said the Chinese also could usethe helicopters to add an airborne wing to their army.   The CH-47D is the latest version of the CH-47, the U.S. Army'sprimary medium-lift helicopter. Boeing says that its main use isfor rapid deployment of tactical units in combat.   The helicopter can carry up to 44 combat-equipped soldiers andhas a top speed of 174 mph and a cruising speed of 161 mph.   Kang said the helicopter tests in Tibet had nothing to do withrecent unrest in the area. Tibetan activists rioted in Lhasa lastautumn and again in March. More than 30 Tibetans and Chinese policewere killed.   A Western military analyst in Beijing said he did not think thehelicopters, if purchased, would be used to quell domestic unrest.   ``The Chinese traditionally test helicopters for high-altitude.Over one-third of the country is mountainous,'' he said. Beforebuying 24 medium-sized Blackhawk helicopters from the American firmSikorsky Co. several years ago, China also tested them in Tibet, hesaid.   Western military analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said the prospective purchase would be consistent with Chinesemilitary reforms designed to create a more professional army.   The analysts pointed to China's poor showing in its brief warwith Vietnam as an example of China's need to modernize itsmilitary. China has shifted its military focus from preparednessfor all-out war to training for limited conflicts.   ``These types of conflicts need a speedy response,'' said onediplomat. ``The Boeing helicopters could be useful.''   In June, China announced the formation of the ``First Platoon''_ an airborne force trained in rapid response techniques.   Today's official China Daily reported several military regionsrecently completed exercises in north and south China to upgradetheir ability to respond rapidly to ``local conflict.''</TEXT></DOC>
