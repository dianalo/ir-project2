In other words, much radiographic work is being donethe way it was over 50 years ago. Significant advances in automationhave changed the face of manufacturing, and industry has shared in thebenefits brought by such progress. The handling of parts, which was onceresponsible for a large measure of labor costs, is now assigned to roboticequipment. In nondestructive testing processes, some progress has beenachieved in automation - for example, in real-time imaging systems. However,only recently have truly automated NDT begun to emerge. There are twomajor reasons to introduce automation into NDT - reliability and productivity.Any process or technique that can improve the reliability of parts testingcould easily justify the capital investments required.</TEXT></DOC>
