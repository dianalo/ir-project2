After all, this would only make it easier for politicians and economic forecasters to dine on their feet. That's an easy feat right now. Also, which do you use to &quot;put your best foot forward&quot; -- the larger foot, or the smaller one?    Think of the effect on football. Where do you place the 50-yard line? First and 10 -- what? Third and inches -- which kind?    Where will this end? Like you, I believe that we should put our foot down and say enough is enough. Those recommending this change are a bunch of heels. Obviously, I'm with you, heart and sole.    Joseph Leff   Overland Park, Kan.   ---   If Congress did deal with the measure of length known as the foot in the same way it deals with the measure of monetary value known as the dollar, the country would now be suffering from &quot;legal-length&quot; laws that allowed people who had contracted to pay so many &quot;feet&quot; of some commodity to discharge their obligations by delivery of an ever-decreasing length of that commodity. Members of Congress would benefit from such laws by receiving campaign contributions from those who used the &quot;legal-length&quot; dodge to cheat on their contractual duties. And there would be endless debates among economists and other pundits on what the &quot;real&quot; cause of &quot;foot inflation&quot; actually is.    The evident absurdity of a congressional license to change the length of the foot is no greater than that of the license Congress (or, worse, the Federal Reserve System) now exercises to change the value of the dollar from day to day -- usually downward. Certainly, the Founding Fathers saw the connection, which is why (as the Journal observes) they placed the &quot;coinage power&quot; in the same clause of the Constitution in which appears the &quot;weights and measures power.&quot;    The Founders, however, not only indicated that the monetary unit should be a standard (that is, somehow fixed), but also told us what that standard is by explicitly referring to the &quot;dollar&quot; in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. A dollar was not an abstract unit, but a specific coin, historically determined to contain 371 1/4 grains (troy) of pure silver, as specified in the Coinage Act of 1792. Gold was to be valued in &quot;dollars,&quot; at the market exchange rate between it and silver (then about 15 to 1).    So, constitutionally, a dollar is a fixed unit and a commodity -- an exact weight of silver, unalterable save by constitutional amendment. There having been no constitutional amendment since 1792 dealing with this subject, one can only wonder how Congress thinks it can do what it does to the dollar, and why the American people let it get away with such chicanery.
