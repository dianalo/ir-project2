The 6 million Quebecois, who have struggled for two centuries topreserve the ``difference'' between their province and the rest ofCanada, want that linguistic and cultural distinction acknowledgedin the constitution.   Some English-speaking Canadians find the idea repugnant. Thedisagreement over a constitutional amendment to address Quebec'sconcerns has led to renewed fears that the province might opt forindependence and go it alone.   Canada's new constitution was approved in 1982 over Quebec'sobjections. It applies in the province, but the lack of unanimityleft what McGill University law professor Jeremy Webber calls ``arankling sore.''   To remedy the problem, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and thepremiers of all 10 provinces met in April 1987 at a governmentretreat called Meech Lake, near Ottawa. They agreed on aconstitutional amendment that addressed Quebec's five main concerns.   A three-year deadline was set for ratification by provinciallegislatures, and all gave their approval except Manitoba and NewBrunswick. Newfoundland's legislature ratified the Meech Lakeaccord, but withdrew the approval after a change of government.   It's all off unless unanimous ratification is achieved by June23.   ``What we are doing now is completing what was done in 1981 and1982,'' said Gil Remillard, Quebec's minister for intergovernmentalaffairs.   Despite frequently heated debate and constant press coverage,few people seem to have read the Meech Lake agreement or know whatit contains. The only part virtually everyone is familiar with, andwhere the major controversy lies, is the section that calls Quebeca ``distinct society.''   That would oblige the Supreme Court to take Quebec'sdistinctiveness into account when considering specific laws whoseconstitutionality was being challenged. It is an enormouslysignificant symbol to French-speaking Quebecois.   Mulroney has said recognizing Quebec as a distinct society``simply confirms the obvious. Quebec is different, and thatdifference is very much worth conserving in the interest of allCanadians.''   Opposition is of two basic kinds: anti-French feeling that isdifficult to measure, and the belief that Canada is one country andthe rules should be the same for all.   The concept of a single Canada is ``a strong argument,'' saidWebber, the McGill professor. ``That kind of position has a lot ofreal gut appeal, even among those who are very favorable to theFrench fact in Canada.''   Premier Frank McKenna of New Brunswick, trying to break theimpasse, proposed a ``companion resolution'' to Meech Lake that nowis the subject of parliamentary committee hearings.   It mainly involves the four other points in the agreement: therole of the provinces on immigration, allowing provinces to opt outof federal shared-cost programs, requiring annual conferences ofthe prime minister and provincial premiers, and the formula foramending the constitution.   Quebec says it will not accept changes in the accord or discussrelated issues until it is approved.   ``If Meech Lake doesn't pass, that means our five points havebeen rejected,'' Remillard said, adding that Quebec's governingLiberal Party was studying what action to take in that event.   ``There are people who will feel profoundly affected if itdoesn't pass,'' he said. ``There will be consequences.''   The widespread sentiment in Quebec and elsewhere is that a dealwill be made before June 23, perhaps to accept the accord as is andconvene a constitutional conference to devise companion measures.   Remillard said a meeting of the prime minister and premiersprobably would be held this month.   Polls indicate nationalist sentiment in Quebec is growing.   ``Quebecois feel they were humiliated in 1982 and that theycannot submit to a second humiliation, but nobody has an interestin separation, except maybe the Parti Quebecois,'' said VincentLemieux, a political scientist and analyst at Laval University inQuebec.   Businessmen in Quebec, always strongly federalists, support theMeech Lake accord, but Guy Boulanger, vice president of the QuebecChamber of Commerce, said they were ready to take the separatistroad if the agreement was rejected.   ``The businessmen of Quebec want to do business,'' he said. ``Wehave talked enough. The time has come. We don't want a breakup ofCanada. That's the last thing we want, but we are ready to livewith it.''   Little passion is evident in the nationalist sentiment.Interviews with a range of Quebecois indicated few really wantedseparation from Canada and that it would be calm if it occurred.   Neither the provincial nor national government wants separation.As Mulroney put it: ``What is at stake is enormous, and what is indispute is modest.''</TEXT></DOC>
