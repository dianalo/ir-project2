Basic features of the Smalltalk-80 languageare described including messages, objects, classes, and inheritance.A simulation control framework for Smalltalk-80 is explained using asimple example. Smalltalk-80 language appears to have a number of featuresthat makes it unique when compared to traditional simulation languages.A comparison of Smalltalk-80 with the traditional simulation softwareconcludes the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
