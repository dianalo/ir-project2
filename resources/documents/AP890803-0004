(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Even the captain of an eavesdroppingSoviet spy ship seemed impressed by the first successful launch ofthe Navy's deadly new Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine.   ``My best regards to the skipper of the sub,'' the Sovietcaptain radioed after the 44-foot missile roared away from the USSTennessee, burst to the surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warheadto a target far down the Atlantic tracking range on Wednesday.   The message was radioed to the launch support ship RangeSentinel. Earlier, the Range Sentinel had warned the Russiantrawler not to get too close.   ``We're not going to interfere with the launch,'' replied thecaptain of the Soviet ship, and he stayed about 2{ miles away, justoutside the security zone.   For years, Soviet spy ships have observed most launchings fromCape Canaveral.   Greenpeace U.S.A. activists who oppose nuclear weapons at seahalted the launch attempt last Friday by sailing ships into thesecurity zone and refusing to leave, arguing they were ininternational waters. They stayed away Wednesday, saying they hadmade their point.   Following the 11 a.m. launch, Rear Adm. Arlington Campbell,commander of Submarine Group 6, told reporters on the RangeSentinel: ``As far as we can tell from our telemetry, it was atotally nominal launch. From all indications, everything has beensuccessful.''   The Navy did not disclose how far the warhead section traveled.   Each of the $23.7 million missiles is designed to propel as manyas 12 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 milesaway.   The results were far different from those of the Trident 2'sfirst submarine launch on March 21, when the missile cartwheeledout of control and exploded just four seconds after it was launchedfrom the Tennessee.   Investigators reported that failure was caused by a faultymechanical linkage responsible for moving the rocket motor nozzlesback and forth to control direction. The system was redesigned.   ``We had one failure at sea,'' Campbell said. ``But these areproduction evaluation missiles. We're here to learn. They getimproved so they are right when they are actually deployed.''   The Navy plans seven or eight more underwater tests over thenext few months. If all goes as planned, the Navy will send theTennessee on operational patrol next March with 24 of thenuclear-tipped missiles.   Before the Trident 2 was taken to sea, the Navy conducted 19flight tests from a land launch, rating 15 of them successful.</TEXT></DOC>
