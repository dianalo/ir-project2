This year it shouldhave been celebrating a new legitimacy as Germanyrediscovered nationhood.   But West Germany's mainstream parties have stolen itsthunder.</LP><TEXT>   German nationhood is no longer an issue for theRepublicans alone, and the rush toward reunification hasdeflated the nationalist party's bid for political leverage.Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, or CDU,and other important parties now embrace German unity with azeal previously heard only at the Republicans' beerhallrallies, albeit more delicately and with greater effect.   Voters are turning away from the Republicans' bluntlaw-and-order rhetoric and its haunting visions of a greaterGermany. Demoralized and split into bickering camps, theparty is being written off as a contender in nationalpolitics.   Indeed, the party's death knell may have been soundedFriday with the resignation of Chairman Franz Schoenhuber,who complained that the party he founded had been taken overby &quot;a small clique of extremist functionaries&quot; that he feltunable to oppose. Otto Lambsdorff, head of Chancellor Kohl'sjunior coalition partners, the Free Democrats, commented:&quot;The remains. . .of this party will soon scatter themselvesinto the wind.&quot;   The Republicans burst onto the national scene with astartling 7.5% vote in the January 1989 city-state electionsof West Berlin, where social tensions played to the party'santi-immigrant themes. Alarm grew in Bonn again last Junewhen the upstarts captured 7.1% of the West German nationalvote for the European Parliament. Germany's Europeanneighbors and Israel expressed concern over the party'spopularity.   The center-right Christian Democrats were battered in thepolls as conservative voters flocked to the brash Republicansin state and local elections, handing upset victories to theleft-of-center Social Democratic Party, or SDP. TheRepublicans hoped to win more than 5% of the vote in nextDecember's national ballot, enough for parliamentary seats.Worried CDU leaders talked of coalitions with the Republicanson the state level.   All that has changed. In the key May 13 elections in thebig states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony,accounting for 40% of the West German electorate, theRepublicans fell woefully short of the minimum 5% requiredfor representation. Pollsters say the party would be lucky tomuster 2% of a national vote now.   The relief in Bonn is audible. During a televisedpolitical roundtable analyzing the May election results, theonly point on which CDU Chairman Kohl and SDP ChairmanHans-Jochen Vogel could agree was the demise of theRepublicans.   Paradoxically, many West Germans, including Republicansupporters, lately have been thinking twice aboutunification. Estimates that unity will cost West Germanshundreds of billions of marks over several years have evensent some conservatives scurrying to the Social Democrats,who have been urging a slower approach to unification.   &quot;Unification has become a two-edged sword for us. We'velost a lot of wind from our sails,&quot; concedes Centa Hirsch,the Republicans' national manager.   The Republicans, described by senior SDP politicianJohannes Rau as &quot;a mixture of prejudices brewed into apolitical soup,&quot; have tried to regain the initiative. Theyassert that German unity should reinstitute the borders of1937, which include large parts of what is now Poland and theSoviet Union. This drew a deafening silence from anelectorate already fretting about the Kremlin's reaction tolosing East Germany.   Meanwhile, West Germany's preoccupation with unificationhas overshadowed other issues that earned the Republicanspoints: tough anti-crime reforms and airtight immigrationlaws to keep &quot;Germany for Germans.&quot; In addition, the Kohlgovernment, trying to regain right-wing voters, last yearswitched interior ministers and clamped down on immigrantswith a series of tougher asylum laws.   Before he quit, Republican Chairman Schoenhuber, acharismatic, hard-hitting speaker who referred frequently tohis wartime service as a Waffen-SS sergeant, had blamed theparty's poor showing in the elections and in polls on ahostile news media and left-wing smear campaign. On themorning after the Republicans' May 13 setbacks, Mr.Schoenhuber declared that the political winds would shiftagain, and &quot;the votes will go to those who have had asnootful of socialism in all its forms.&quot;   Admittedly, the Republicans' press has been less thanfavorable. But the media hasn't had to look hard formaterial.   Mr. Schoenhuber's wartime escapades with the Waffen-SSwere vividly described in his memoir, &quot;I Was There.&quot;Anti-Semitic remarks by one regional party boss was followedby another's assertion that anti-nuclear protesters were scumbelonging in labor camps. Yet another gained a reputation asa bully for personally manhandling dissenters at partymeetings.   Hounded by the commercial press, the Republicans took astab at setting the record straight with its own Credomagazine. But the venture backfired after Die Zeit, anational newsweekly, drew attention to the fact that Credowas advertising videos for sale featuring Third Reichnewsreels of Adolf Hitler and other Nazi bigwigs.   &quot;Things can't go on like this,&quot; said the Republicans' Ms.Hirsch. &quot;Voters from the far right aren't enough. We can'tget into the big parliaments without mainstream voters. Andthey are being alienated by some of our front-line people.&quot;   As the party split into rebellious factions, Mr.Schoenhuber tried to weed out radical firebrands. His primetarget was the Bavarian party chief, Harald Neubauer. Mr.Neubauer, co-publisher of Credo magazine, was seen as aleading candidate to eventually replace Mr. Schoenhuber, whois 67 years old. After Mr. Schoenhuber resigned Friday, partyheadquarters in Munich said his former deputy, Johanna Grund,56, would replace him until a new party leader is chosen.   If the Republicans have one last shot, it would beOctober's state election in Bavaria, an arch-conservativestronghold long dominated by the Christian Social Union, theBavarian sister party of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats. TheRepublicans confidently set a goal of polling 15%. But arecent Munich newspaper poll put their statewide backing atless than 3%.</TEXT></DOC>
