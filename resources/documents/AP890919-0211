Computer security firms and companies that supply anti-viralsoftware say they have been deluged by calls since word of the``Datacrime'' virus was spread widely last week by the news media.   ``Frankly, the virus isn't all that important a virus, yet thisphone is ringing off the hook,'' Ross Greenberg, a New Yorker whomakes a virus protector called Flu-Shot Plus, said late last week.   ``The alarms that are going off absolutely staggered me,'' saidWinn Schwartau, president of American Computer Security IndustriesInc. in Nashville, Tenn. He said several government agencies andFortune 500 companies had contacted him about the virus.   Greenberg said he has received maybe a half-dozen reports of thevirus since it surfaced earlier this year. The Computer VirusIndustry Association of Santa Clara, Calif., has received sevenreports, chairman John McAfee said Monday.   In contrast, there have been thousands of reports of otherviruses. Far more people will be hit on Oct. 13 by the less harmfulbut more widespread Jerusalem virus, also known as the PLO or Fridaythe 13th virus.   ``I'm more worried about spilling a cup of coffee on my keyboardthan I am about the Datacrime virus,'' Greenberg said.   Computer viruses are pieces of software written by anonymousprogrammers that make copies of themselves and spread from onemachine to another through infected floppy disks, office networks orphone links such as computer bulletin boards.   The Datacrime virus attacks the hard disk data-storage devices ofIBM-compatible personal computers that use Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOSoperating system. It wipes out the directory section, making itimpossible for the disk's contents to be read.   The virus is triggered when an infected program is used anytimeafter the computer's internal clock passes Oct. 12, the traditionaldate for Columbus Day. It is also known as the Columbus Day orIcelandic virus.   The virus was found lying dormant in computers by people whonoticed that some of their programs had swollen inexplicably.Infected programs were turned over to experts who dismantled thevirus and found out how it worked and when it would be triggered.   Computer security experts say the best thing computer users cando to protect themselves from the Datacrime or any other virus is tomake backup copies every day of everything they want to save.   ``People should make backups the way they brush their teeth inthe morning, like a basic part of hygiene,'' Greenberg said.   Users can limit their exposure to viruses by staying away frombootleg software while being cautious in their use of computerbulletin boards and networks. But viruses have even been found innew, store-bought software in a few rare instances.   Several companies make software that scans programs for knownviruses, but those scanners won't pick up viruses they don'trecognize.   Other programs stop a machine cold and alert the user when aprogram tries to do something unauthorized, such as writing on anoff-limits portion of the hard disk. The latest versions allow usersto ``teach'' them to give fewer false alarms, which can be a majorannoyance.   Once an infected program is found, the usual course is to eraseit and write over it with zeroes so it can't be resurrected by aclever programmer. Some companies say they can delete a virus whilesaving the infected program, while others say that approach isunreliable.   ``It's absolutely impossible for anybody to say we have a fix forthis,'' said Pamela Kane, president of Panda Systems of Wilmington,Del.   PC Magazine earlier this year gave its top ratings to Greenberg'sFlu-Shot Plus, a $10 program distributed through computer bulletinboards, and Certus from FoundationWare Inc. of Cleveland, whichcosts $189.   The small group of people making virus detection or eradicationsoftware also includes Panda Systems, the Computer Virus IndustryAssociation, McAfee's own Interpath Corp. and Raymond Glath's RGSoftware Systems Inc. in Willow Grove, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
