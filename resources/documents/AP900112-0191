He told a news conference Solidarity Prime Minister TadeuszMazowiecki will visit Prague later this month and Vaclav Havel, thenewly elected president of Czechoslovakia, will visit Warsaw soonafter.   ``We should turn away from the formalism which dominated ourrelations in the past. There is a political necessity to eliminateall barriers,'' Dienstbier said.   Dienstbier met with Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski,Mazowiecki and President Wojciech Jaruzelski. He placed flowers atthe grave of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidarity priestmurdered by security police in 1984.   Skubiszewski told Dienstbier their meeting represented animportant moment in the history of the two countries. ``Weassociate great hopes both with the new authorities ofCzechoslovakia and with you as a minister,'' he said.   Dienstbier said he discussed improvement of economic ties,relaxation of travel regulations between the two countries, andenvironmental pollution.   He said Czechoslovak and Polish economic experts will gather inPrague next week to work out ways to improve economic cooperation.   Dienstbier, sworn in Dec. 10 as a member of the firstnon-communist government in Czechoslovakia in 41 years, arrived inWarsaw on Wednesday.   Poland's first non-communist government since World War II wasapproved by parliament on Sept. 12.   Dientsbier, Havel and other activists from Charter 77, the mainhuman rights group in Czechoslovakia, and members of the nowdisbanded Polish Committee for the Defense of Workers or KOR, begana tradition in 1978 of meeting along the border between the twocountries.   Dienstbier evoked that tradition as one element which allowedboth nations to remove the authoritarian system that dominated allforms of public and political life for over four decades.   A proposal to form a confederation between Czechoslovakia andPoland was discussed but Dienstbier said his government wasinterested in the fastest possible building of one Europe and notin creating new political blocs.   In Prague, the state CTK news agency said Thursday a group ofCzechoslovak historians asked parliament speaker Alexander Dubcekto investigate alleged preparations for communist militaryintervention against Poland in 198O.   Dubcek, elected parliament speaker on Dec. 28, 1989, led the``Prague Spring'' Communist reforms in Czechoslovakia that werecrushed by a Soviet-led invasion of five Warsaw Pact countries inAugust 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
