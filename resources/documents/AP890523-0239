Traders reported more dollar selling from the Federal Reserveand central banks in Britain and Japan, but they said that onceagain the market ignored the intervention.   ``The market is sort of catching its breath here ... but there'sstill very strong sentiment behind the dollar even though we'reseeing a pause right now,'' said William P. Sterling, aninternational economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.   The slight retrenchment of the dollar against some keycurrencies helped push up most interest rates in the credit marketsand weaken stock prices, analysts said.   Gold prices were mixed in the United States, although overseasthey regained some of the steep losses that stemmed from Monday'sdollar rally. A troy ounce of gold fell $2.65 to a late bid priceof $361.85 a troy ounce, according to the Republic National Bank ofNew York.   The dollar started out strong in overnight trading, closing atanother recent high in Tokyo, but fell against most currencies inEurope and was mixed in the United States from profit-taking andamid speculation that Japan and the United States might be changingtheir credit policies.   Traders speculated that the Bank of Japan would soon raise itsdiscount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to commercialbanks, and that the Fed might ease U.S. rates, both to stem thedollar's rise.   The market was also rife with rumors about a possible newcurrency stabilization initiative by the United States and its sixmajor trading partners, known as the Group of Seven.   The dollar rose sharply on Monday, smashing the 2-mark level forthe first time in 2{ years and hitting a 1{-year high vs. the yen,due largely to perceived weakness among the G-7 in foreign-exchangepolicies.   ``The dollar cannot turn around until there are policy changeson either side of the water,'' said Ronald H. Holzer, chiefcurrency dealer with Harris Trust andamp; Co. in Chicago. ``Until thenwe'll be trading off the rumors.''   But Fed governor Robert Heller said inflation remained ``a keyfactor to be considered in monetary policy-making,'' and he gave nogave indication the central bank was considering easing credit todepress the dollar.   On Tuesday, the government reported that durable goods shot up2.9 percent in April, the best showing in four months and furtherindication of the economy's strength.
