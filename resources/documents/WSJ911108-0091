The Peoria, Ill., heavy-equipment maker told workers atfactories in the Illinois towns of Aurora and East Peoria notto report for shifts beginning after 12:01 a.m. CST today.</LP><TEXT>   About 2,400 auto workers struck the company at selectedlocations earlier this week, after lengthy talks betweenCaterpillar and the UAW's about 16,000 workers collapsed.   The company complained yesterday that the union'sselective strike was &quot;designed to inflict maximum damage tothe company.&quot; Caterpillar, in what amounts to a corporatetit-for-tat, added that it &quot;selected facilities that will putmaximum pressure on the union with minimal additional harm toCaterpillar and the majority of our employees.&quot;   A spokesman denied the company was shuttering the plantsbecause of shortages generated by the UAW's strike at otherplants. He said it's &quot;possible&quot; the company will attempt tocontinue operating the East Peoria and Aurora facilities withsalaried workers.   &quot;We hope today's action will convince UAW leadership toresume bargaining and negotiate an agreement that makes sensefor Caterpillar,&quot; the company said. Caterpillar saidoperations at other UAW-represented plants will continue.   The earlier contract expired Oct. 1., although the unioncontinued to work while the talks were under way.   In a release issued from the union's Detroit headquarters,the UAW blasted Caterpillar's &quot;mean-spirited&quot; action as a&quot;cruel and shameful subterfuge to reduce bloated inventoriesbuilt up by management in anticipation of a strike.&quot;   The struggle between Caterpillar and the union is beingwatched closely because of what they may portend about thefuture of &quot;pattern bargaining,&quot; a long-traditional procedurein which one employer negotiates with a union, and othercompanies in the field use that contract as a template inreaching their own pact.   The union reached agreement with Caterpillar competitorDeere andamp; Co. in mid-October, but Caterpillar has maintained itneeds a different agreement to make it competitiveinternationally.   Union officials couldn't be reached yesterday for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
