(Micro Mephisto) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Jillette, Penn.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>SPELL-CHECKERS ARE our key to freedom of speech.andP;  Wait, hear me OUt on thisone.andM;You know Prodigy-the COMputer service that was in the news a while ago fordeciding that certain subscribers' messages should not be read by othersubscribers? The messages they banned either trashed Prodigy policies ordealt with special sexual habits that Prodigy found icky.andM;Censorship is everyone's favorite word nowadays (OK, it's not everyone'sfavorite word-David Letterman is still fond of spackle, and I have a weaknessfor metonymy*).andP;  But censorship has been thrown around much too freely inthis whole Prodigy thang.andM;My dictionary defines censorship this way:  Censorship-n.andP;  1.andP;  the act orpractice of censoring.&quot;andM;That's a big help, right? But maybe it's my dictionary.andP;  In my dictionary,cat looks like this: &quot;Cat-n.andP;  1.andP;  a small domesticated carniv...andP;  wait aminute, you know what a cat is, don't be stupid!&quot;andM;I've made it a pretty snotty dictionary.andM;Anyway, good old capitalism mill easily take care of the Prodigy style ofcensorship.andP;  Prodigy's new slogan should be: &quot;Prodigy-We give you lots ofadvertisements for Sears AND we read your personal mail!&quot;andM;Reading private mail is a goofy, insulting habit, but if Prodigy does it andnot the government, it's not censorship.andP;  It's just time to sign up for GEnieor CompuServe.andM;Spell-checking mill be our savior.andP;  To most people, it's just a utilitariantool, but it can be a creative tool as well.andP;  If used properly, it'll turndull prose into highbrow literature.andP;  It can turn mailing labels into shortbursts of free verse.andP;  And it can defend against censorship from the peopleat Prodigy.andP;  Here's how.andM;The next time your spell-checker finds a misspelled word, look at thecomputer's first guess, option &quot;a.&quot; If it's not the word you had in mind, Ibet it's a more interesting choice.andP;  Try it.andM;For instance, if you ran Danielle Steel's sloppily typed first drafts througha spell-cheeker and kept hitting &quot;a,&quot; you might end up with James Joyce.andO;(The nightmare of many literature Ph.D.'s is that running the published formof Ulysses through a spell-checker would yield Passion's Promise.)andM;So take a look at your personal supplementary dictionary.andP;  If you're anythinglike me (and I think you're exactly like me-I feel we're really starting tobond on these back pages), you've added your last name, your company's name,&quot;Uma,&quot; and every obscenity known to 2 Live Crew.andM;Delete all the obscenities from your dictionary.andP;  It'll be worth it.andP;  That'sit, all the work is done.andP;  Now, when we want to type something that thepowers that be don't want us to type, we can just use dirty words.andP;  Thesewords aren't in the dictionary that came with the spellchecker, and youdeleted them from your personal dictionary, so the spellchecker flags them.andO;When it does, you hit &quot;a.&quot;andM;Soon we'll all learn what the &quot;a&quot; words stand for and we can talk like adults...andP;  even on Prodigy.andM;And don't worry about the censors catching on-they're stupid as shiite.andM;* If you don't believe metonymy is a great word, the next time you're at aparty with Edwin Newman and he calls you a taboo word for genitalia, say,&quot;Metonymy, right, Ed?&quot; It'll bring down the house.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
