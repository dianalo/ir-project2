The Bourse clearing house said access to the contract, based on the CAC 40 index of French stocks, will be limited at first to member firms trading for their own accounts. This restriction will help them prepare for the opening of the new contract to other investors later and will allow them to better hedge stock portfolios they hold for the purpose of market-making.    Rules of the new market will set the value of each contract at 200 times the CAC 40 index, which was created in June to cover 40 French blue chip stocks and is based on end-1987 equaling 1,000. The CAC 40 closed Thursday at 1,327.75, which would put the value of one contract at 265,550 francs. The index is to be updated every 30 seconds.    Price moves for the futures contract will be based on increments of 0.1 point, or a face amount of 20 francs, the clearing house said. Daily price fluctuations will be limited to 50 points, or 10,000 francs a contract, while initial margin deposits will be set at 20,000 francs a contract. Settlement will be in cash.    The market will be structured to offer four different contracts at all times, with the shortest one expiring at the end of the current month. There also will be contracts expiring at the end of each of the two following months, plus a longer-dated contract set to expire at the end of the following quarter.    Thus in January, there would be a January contract, a February contract, a March contract and a June contract.    The clearing house said it will reserve the option to modify its initial margin requirements and daily limits in response to changing market conditions. </TEXT></DOC>
