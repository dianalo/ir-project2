This muonic helium slows down like a heavyproton through a series of ionization collision with the surroundingmolecules. On the other hand, before the kinetic energy becomes smallerthan the appropriate threshold, as a consequence of several reactions,the ({alpha}{mu}) ion can be stripped and the muon can be made availableagain for the cycle of the fusion reaction. The reactivation efficiencyare calculated using the several theoretical model for the cross sections,and the isotope and density effects of the target elements are studied.Due to the comparatively large mass of {mu}/sup -/ meson, the {mu}/sup-/ meson transfer for a tritium has large cross section than deutronor hydrogen (proton) in the low energy. At high energy region, the crosssection for tritium is smaller than the deutron or hydrogen, but thestripping process is mostly due to the ionization process instead of{mu}/sup -/-meson transfer process in this high energy region. Thus,the reactivation efficiency for tritium target becomes about 10-20% higherthan the dueteron or proton target. The authors' calculation for thetransfer cross section is based on the Born approximation which is notso accurate for the low energy region and the present status of the crosssection evaluation in low energy is not satisfactory. This requires morecareful study.</TEXT></DOC>
