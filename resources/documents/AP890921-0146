A Trump Shuttle plane was to leave Friday morning, laden withtons of supplies, including clothing, air mattresses and water.   ``We're going to load it up with as much as we can get on theairplane,'' said Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle. CityCouncil President Andrew Stein and Luis Miranda, the mayor's adviserfor Hispanic affairs, will accompany the shipment.   Stein, noting the 1.5 million New York-area residents of PuertoRican descent, said, ``We are going to strengthen our ties andrelieve the suffering for those who are in need. ... In assistingthem, we will be assisting our neighbors as well.''   The hurricane destroyed or damaged homes of an estimated 129,000people on Puerto Rico.   Pop music stars were joining in the fund-raising effort, which onSunday includes a telethon on the Spanish-language networkTelemundo, a marathon show at a South Bronx theater and a concert atNassau Coliseum on Long Island.   ``My office has received hundreds of calls, and to my surprise,the majority of calls are from English-speaking people,'' said theRev. Ruben Diaz, executive director of the Christian CommunityBenevolent Association, which is coordinating some events.   ``We have a saying in Puerto Rico that you know who your friendsare when you are in need,'' he said. ``People without knowing ushave come forward and are volunteering to help. It's beautiful.''   Along with three banks accepting donations for disaster aid inPuerto Rico, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York asked itschurches to collect money this weekend for relief work throughoutthe Caribbean. The hurricane also struck the Virgin Islands,Montserrat, Guadeloupe and Antigua.
