The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 150.16points at 23962.07. The index lost 266.43 points Thursday.   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose357.10 points to 24319.17.

Among rumors spread quickly on the market Friday afternoonwas that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fled to Libya, whichlater proved unfounded.   Futures indexes turned upward around the same time therumor was spread, helping push up stock prices. But observersattributed the midday recovery of stock prices more totechnical factors than to the rumor.   Yoshio Ogawa, general manager of stock trading at NikkoSecurities, said a small number of investors and dealersbought stocks in response to the rumor.   &quot;But as the Nikkei fell below 23,500 points {Fridaymorning}, investors shared the perception that the marketdeserves to see some rebound,&quot; he said.   &quot;To take profit whenever it's possible&quot; was the stanceinvestors in general maintained, said a trader at Dai-IchiSecurities, noting that institutional investors remained coolto the rumor as they had been hurt when they bought onunfounded Iraq rumors in the past.   Sentiment was damped from the morning because of theovernight plunge on Wall Street and a late surge of oilprices, sending stock prices down midmorning.   The Nikkei index declined as low as 23,405.71 points inthe morning session, marking its lowest level this year. Thelevel compares with the previous intraday low of 23,547.27points posted Aug. 24 and the lowest daily close this year at23,737.63, on Aug. 23.   Traders predict the market will continue to see selling byinvestors reducing positions.   Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment research at NomuraSecurities, said stock prices are under sell pressure due tothe market's internal factors.   Such factors include approaching midyear book closings bymany financial institutions, as well as the expiration of theSeptember futures contract on Sept. 13, he said.   Selling by institutions was increasingly noticeableFriday, reflecting their concern about their midyear accountclosings at the end of September, traders said.   Due to growing expectation that the market is unlikely torecover soon and help improve their performance, fundmanagers were selling to avoid further losses, they said.   An official at a life insurance company said his company'sseparate account funds started to buy Friday. But many otherlife insurance companies are still maintaining a sellingstance.   Sell pressure is also expected to be strong next week asmany investors are likely to unwind their September futurescontracts ahead of the expiration, rather than rolling themover to December.   Nikkei Shimbun Inc. announced at a news conference lateFriday that the publisher of the economic daily compiling theNikkei index since 1949 will examine the possibility ofreplacing some of the issues included in the index, which isbased on 225 selected stocks.   The company said it will decide over the next two monthsif such replacement or any other changes are necessary tomake the index reflect stock price changes more accurately.   Ending higher Friday were high-technology shares, whichbounced up from their sharp losses on the previous day.   Kyocera gained 260 yen ($1.85) to 7,350 yen, while TDK wasup 170 yen to 5,630 yen.   On the other hand, Thursday's winners, such as gold miningcompanies and Tokyu Group shares, fell back Friday onprofit-taking.   Sumitomo Metal Mining declined 20 yen to 1,550 yen andMitsui Mining lost 39 yen to 921 yen.   After poor overnight results from New York and Tokyo,London opened easier. The release of U.S. unemploymentfigures for August had little effect on Wall Street'sperformance, which was led higher by the oil sector in thewake of firmer spot crude prices. Traders said London'sturnaround in the closing hours of trading was largely due toWall Street's positive lead.   &quot;A lack of business has been the main problem,&quot; one tradersaid. The highest volume levels Friday were recorded in thethird-line, lesser capitalized stocks.   Speculation that the pound might enter the exchange-ratemechanism of the European Monetary System over the weekendwas quashed early in the session, leaving inflation acontinuing concern for the U.K. economy and U.K. equityinvestors, traders said.
