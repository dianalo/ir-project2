TheFlorida panther originally ranged from eastern Texas eastward through Arkansas,Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and parts of Tennesseeand South Carolina.Because of persecution, mainly through hunting and trapping, and habitatlosses which started with the early settlers and have continued, the onlyknown viable population of the Florida panther is found in the Big CypressSwamp/Everglades region of south Florida. An estimated population of 30to 50 animals is all that remains.Because the Florida panther is listed as an endangered species under theprovisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, a recoveryplan has been prepared and was approved by the Fish and Wildlife Servicein 1981. In conjunction with the plan's approval, the Florida Game andFresh Water Fish Commission initiated several of the important pantherstudies identified as high priority needs in the plan. As a result of thesestudies, as well as other studies being conducted by the National ParkService, a great deal of information concerning the panther's habitat requirements,food habits, reproduction, population size and density, health conditions,etc., is becoming available. To better utilize and incorporate all of thecurrent information into the recovery effort, the original recovery planhas been revised and was approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service on June22, 1987.The recovery objective as specified in the revised Florida Panther RecoveryPlan is to achieve three viable, self-sustaining populations within thehistoric range. Only one population now exists according to the informationwhich is currently available.Consequently, population reestablishment through successful reintroductionswill be crucial to achieving recovery for the Florida panther. The revisedrecovery plan contains a detailed outline and narrative section which addressescaptive breeding and reintroduction plans for the Florida panther (pages39 to 44). The process initially involves the use of nonendangered surrogatecougars as part of a feasibility study. This study is designed to testtwo different reintroduction techniques: the translocation and releaseof wild caught adults or subadults (two males and three females) into thereintroduction area, and the release of properly conditioned captive-raisedoffspring into the area. The two techniques, which will be tested separately,are scheduled to begin in June 1988 and extend for at least 1 year each.The animals will be sterilized and fitted with transmitter collars forintensive monitoring purposes. The feasibility study is being conductedby the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. The experimental reintroductionarea consists of approximately 1,180,800 acres comprised of Osceola NationalForest, Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, and adjacent private/corporatelands in Baker and Columbia Counties in Florida, and Charlton, Clinch,and Ware Counties in Georgia. The area was selected by the Florida Gameand Fresh Water Fish Commission after a comprehensive evaluation and rankingprocess of potential reintroduction sites in north and central Florida.A decision on the actual reintroduction of Florida panthers will not bemade until a thorough examination and review of the results of the feasibilitystudy and other relevant data. It is anticipated that this decision isat least 3 to 4 years away. In addition, any reintroduced Florida pantherswould be designated and classified as nonessential experimental, as providedfor under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordancewith the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C.4371 <T3>et seq.</T3>), National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR1500-1508), other appropriate Federal regulations, and Fish and WildlifeService procedures for compliance with those regulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
