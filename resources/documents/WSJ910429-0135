Reilly stepped intorelative obscurity in the publishing world when he left hispost as president of Macmillan Inc. to take the helm ofupstart K-III Holdings Inc.   Last week, he stepped back into the limelight with a $650million bid for News Corp.'s Murdoch Magazines unit. Ifsuccessful, K-III, 75%-owned by leveraged buy-out specialistsKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., may finally be closing in onhis goal of becoming a formidable publishing powerhouse,adding consumer magazines to a growing stable of educationaland trade publishing businesses.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, most of K-III's moves have been decidedly lessglamorous and low-profile. But the company has spent morethan $1 billion on properties that range from children'sbooks and encyclopedias to trade magazines with names likeNational Hog Farmer and Ward's Auto World.   In an interview, Mr. Reilly, 52 years old, said he plansto use the Murdoch magazines as a core for additionalpurchases, countering industry speculation that he will selloff some of the titles. Murdoch's eight magazines include NewYork and Seventeen and the race-track newspaper Daily RacingForm. And he said K-III is weighing a public offering as partof its expansion plans, a move other KKR-financed concernshave used. &quot;Our goal is to build a mothership with the sizeof a Macmillan,&quot; said Mr. Reilly.   Mr. Reilly is credited with much of Macmillan's success inthe 1980s, selling off non-publishing operations such asretail book stores and organ factories while acquiring moretrade magazine and book operations. By 1988, Macmillan hadgone from about $400 million in revenue to more than $1billion. With KKR's backing, Mr. Reilly attempted to takeMacmillan over in 1988 but lost to a $2.7 billion bid fromRobert Maxwell's Maxwell Communications Inc. The acquisitiondid net Mr. Reilly about $40 million personally from hisMacmillan stock holdings.   Mr. Reilly stayed on to run Macmillan for a year, but atthe same time formed K-III along with Kohlberg Kravis andother former Macmillan executives to purchase certainMacmillan assets. That arrangement was short-lived; althoughK-III acquired Macmillan's book club and trade magazineoperations, a K-III bid for Macmillan's Berlitz unit wasrejected. Mr. Reilly resigned to run K-III exclusively afterMr. Maxwell, in his words, decided Mr. Reilly couldn't &quot;servetwo masters.&quot;   At K-III, Mr. Reilly is coming into his own after years ofserving behind some larger-than-life executives. At W.R.Grace andamp; Co., he became assistant to J. Peter Grace, companychairman, after serving as head of the home center, sportinggoods, and textile divisions. In 1980, he joined Macmillan,working in the shadow of Edward P. Evans, Macmillan's formerchairman and chief executive. Mr. Reilly was even able tojuggle his own ambitions with Mr. Maxwell, starting up K-IIIHoldings with the British publisher's initial blessings.   A former Army paratrooper who graduated from theUniversity of Notre Dame and Harvard Business School, Mr.Reilly is described by associates and former colleagues asjocular and gregarious, with a knack for making people feelat ease and a reputation as a straight talker. Yet he is alsoknown as a meticulous planner. &quot;He carefully prepares forspeeches and never wings anything, even though it looks likehe is,&quot; said David Adler, a former Macmillan vice president.&quot;I came in working for Maxwell but ended up wanting to workfor Reilly.&quot;   While many in the industry have speculated that KKRpartner Henry Kravis has a particular interest in the glitzymagazine field, Mr. Reilly says he has full control of theK-III operation. &quot;In my experience {with Kravis}, there'snever been any intervention,&quot; says Mr. Reilly. &quot;KKR is veryinvolved with the acquisitions, but when it comes tooperations, we only see each other at quarterly boardmeetings. That's the great strength of KKR: They know whatthey know and know what they don't know. And they don't knowpublishing.&quot;   What KKR does provide are the deep pockets necessary tofinance a media acquisition in the current tough environment.Insiders at K-III say that of the $650 million purchaseprice, about 40% is equity from KKR's investment partnershipsand 60% is cash borrowed from a consortium of banks thatbacks KKR acquisitions. The price represents about 10 timesthe $65 million cash flow of the nine publications, amultiple far below what top-flight publications were sellingfor in the late 1980s.   But the magazine business is in far worse shape today. Anadvertising slump has squeezed profits at New York and NewWoman, while Premiere and European Travel and Life remainunprofitable after several years. Racing Form is highlyprofitable, but now it faces its first competition in yearsfrom Maxwell's Racing Times. Soap Opera Digest has becomemore profitable since its acquisition in 1989, but itstwo-year-old sister publication, Soap Opera Weekly, is onlybarely profitable.   Mr. Reilly says the advertising environment for magazinesmay not get better until 1992, but he says the group's cashflow -- earnings before interest and taxes -- can be improvedimmediately by automating production of the magazines. Whilecost cuts will be sought, he says, no layoffs are planned.   Mr. Reilly depends heavily on the talents of a triumviratethat was formed at Macmillan. The &quot;III&quot; in K-III stands forMr. Reilly plus Charles G. McCurdy, 35, K-III's president whowas the financial whiz behind Macmillan's expansion; andBeverly C. Chell, 48, the vice chairman and general counsel,the position she also held in the 1980s at Macmillan. Thethree own the 25% of K-III not controlled by Kohlberg Kravis.   Mr. Reilly may bring in an outside executive to operatethe consumer magazine group, and there may be othermanagement changes and defections. Last week, for example,European Travel and Life lost its publisher and co-founder,Carl Portale, to Hearst Corp.'s Harper's Bazaar, where hewill be the magazine's first new publisher in 13 years. Mr.Reilly takes it in stride. &quot;He {Mr. Portale} went for themoney. But we are able to offer inducements others can't,&quot;Mr. Reilly says. Traditionally, KKR companies spread equitystakes among 20 or 30 top executives.   Mr. Reilly has already moved to reassure staffers at theMurdoch magazines. On Friday, as word of the plannedacquisition spread, and at the suggestion of News Corp.Chairman Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Reilly met one-on-one withMurdoch's editors and publishers. &quot;He seemed to listen,&quot; saidone editor, adding, &quot;He said he won't sell off magazines andwants to build a publishing company.&quot;   But although a novice in the world of consumer magazines,Mr. Reilly said he wouldn't hesitate to make changes ifnecessary, such as replacing an editor. &quot;Business has to dowith results,&quot; Mr. Reilly says. &quot;If the circulation of themagazine is in a free fall, there is something wrong with theeditorial, and something will be done.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
