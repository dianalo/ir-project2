Derr was elected to succeed George M. Keller as chairman and chief executive officer, effective Jan. 1.    The choice of the 52-year-old Mr. Derr, currently one of two vice chairmen at Chevron, was widely expected. Mr. Keller, 64, will take mandatory retirement at age 65 after more than seven years at the head of the fourth-largest U.S. oil company.    Mr. Derr's move to the top spot isn't expected to prompt major changes at San Francisco-based Chevron. His most striking assignment at the company has been his supervision of the merger with Gulf Corp. following the $13.3 billion acquisition in 1984. The integration of operations is considered a textbook example, drawing on the advice of dozens of committees composed of employees from both companies.    The strapping, 6-foot-3-inch Mr. Derr, who trained as a mechanical engineer and holds a master's degree in business administration, has spent most of his career in staff positions at Chevron's head office. Urbane, though perhaps less gregarious than Mr. Keller, a well-known industry spokesman, he is said to value management by consultation, as evidenced in the committee structure of the Gulf merger.    Mr. Derr began his career at Chevron in 1960 in an MBA development program that led to a number of headquarters assignments. After a two-year stint at the company's El Segundo, Calif., refinery, he returned to staff work in 1969 as assistant to Harold J. Haynes, then president of Chevron, and its chairman and chief executive from 1974 to 1981.    In 1972, at the age of 36, Mr. Derr became the youngest vice president ever at Chevron. In 1979, he became president of Chevron U.S.A., the company's principal domestic unit, and he was elected a Chevron director in 1981. Mr. Derr has been a vice chairman since 1985.    His presumed rival for the chairman's seat was J. Dennis Bonney, 57, the company's other vice chairman. However, Mr. Derr was widely expected to get the nod, having moved into senior positions more swiftly than Mr. Bonney, who wasn't named a director until 1986 -- five years after Mr. Derr -- and wasn't elected as vice chairman until about a year after Mr. Derr. Mr. Bonney has principally been responsible for the company's foreign operations, while Mr. Derr has concentrated on the domestic side.    Under Mr. Keller, Chevron has faced some of its most challenging times, ranging from the heady days of $28-a-barrel oil in 1981, when the company's most pressing task was to invest wisely its burgeoning cash flow, to the dog days of 1986, when oil prices slumped to $10 a barrel and survival seemed the main concern.    With the 1984 purchase of Gulf, Chevron acquired proven reserves of oil and natural gas for about $3 a barrel. But it also acquired a massive mound of debt and faced the daunting task of selling billions of dollars of assets. Long-term debt and leases nearly doubled to more than $13.5 billion. Employment surged from 40,000 people to more than 79,000. Proven reserves of crude more than doubled to 4.1 billion barrels.    Under Mr. Keller's direction, Chevron sold dozens of Gulf operations for a total of more than $5 billion. Long-term debt and lease obligations were slashed more than 50% to $6.26 billion at the end of 1987. The number of employees fell 35% to 51,700.    A genial man, Mr. Keller encouraged executives to put aside Chevron's past closed-mouthed ways. His tolerance of critics allowed annual meetings to run for hours, as holders expressed views on everything from the company's policy in Angola to its operations at a local refinery. </TEXT></DOC>
