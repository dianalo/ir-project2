 But awindow system does not a graphical user interface make.andP;  The industry hasn'tbeen giving enough attention to the tools necessary for actually creatinggraphical user interfaces.andP;  Those tools come under the catch-all heading ofuser interface management systems (UIMSs).andM;A UIMS can be any number of things--a screen painter, an interface layouttool, an interface customization facility.andP;  We can give you a workingdefinition, and we're on the lookout for products that take on the shades ofthat definition, products like DataViews from VI Corporation (Amherst,Massachusetts).andM;A WORKING DEFINITION.andP;  A UIMS is not a user interface, but a means ofcreating graphical front ends for new and existing applications.andP;  With it,you design only the interface, and then create links to the application.andO;Since programming directly with a window system or toolkit can be complex,taxing exercise, a UIMS automatically generates user interface code as youpaint the screen.andP;  Ideally, a UIMS should be portable, both in terms ofmultiple window systems support and modularity.andP;  You should be able to borrowinterface functions from other applications--a plug-and-play approach.andP;  Inaddition, a UIMS should provide testing, prototyping, and evaluationfunctionality.andP;  In other words, you should be able to test and refine thebehavior of a user interface before actually binding it to the program.andP;  It'smore than just testing the way the interface looks and interacts with theuser; it's also making sure that deleting a button or menu item doesn't causeany unforeseen repercussions that could potentially ruin an application.andM;A WORKING EXAMPLE.andP;  Sometimes, it's best to describe a technology by lookingat an actual instance of it.andP;  DataViews provides developers an interactive,graphical development environment for building GUIs.andP;  The product consists oftwo components: DV-Draw, a menu-driven graphics editor, and DV-Tools, alibrary of C subroutines that display and manage graphics, objects, anddrawings created with DV-Draw.andP;  You also use DV-Tools to bind DV-Draw objectsto data and operations within the application.andM;Paint, Not Code.andP;  DataViews' graphics editor is fairly thorough andstraightforward.andP;  It comes with your basic drawing primitives (e.g.,andO;rectangles, lines, circles, etc.) as well as predefined input object (e.g.,andO;menus, buttons, switches, toggles, check boxes, etc.) and practicalpredefined graphics (e.g., scales, meters, and a whole bunch of assortedgraphs) (see Illustration).andP;  DV-Draw will even accommodate animation--albeitsimple animation.andP;  You can develop additional objects with DV-Tools, but, ofcourse, once you're in DV-Tools, you're into programming.andM;Protability.andP;  DataViews is conceptually device-, hardware-, window system-,and operating system-independent.andP;  In addition, via DV-Tools, it can help youintegrate existing commercial software packages.andP;  DataViews also lends itselfto a modular approach to interface development.andP;  Since the interfaces youdesign are completely independent of applications, it's simple to plug in a&quot;used&quot; interface function.andM;DataViews also provides templates to guide you through the design of specificlook and feel-like Mac or NextStep.andP;  Preferably, you'd like to be able topick the appropriate style from a menu, and the system would automaticallybang out the right conventions and interface code.andP;  But we haven't seen anyreally good UIMSs that do that.andP;  Apparently, it's no small task.andP;  Thecomplexities of individual window systems are simply too demanding for thiskind of flexibility.andP;  However, representatives from VI Corporation plan tomenu-ize custom interfaces to some degree in the next release.andP;  We presume,though, that this capability won't be very extensive.andM;Prototyping.andP;  DataViews makes a valuable prototyping tool.andP;  After designing ascreen, you set up variables and ranges that affect the interface you'vedesigned.andP;  For example, let's say you're building a monitoring applicationthat notifies the user with a visual alarm when data reaches a prespecifiedvalue.andP;  And you set it up so that, by mouse-clicking on the alarm, the usercan view a chart of the data.andP;  With DataViews, you can execute the interfacebefore binding it to data with a Preview mode.andP;  If you decide the chart iswrong, you exist out of Preview mode back into DV-Draw to edit it.andM;FOR PROGRAMMERS ONLY.andP;  The problem with UIMSs today (including DataViews) isthat they're still developers' tools.andP;  They haven't yet evolved to wherethey'd be suitable for end-user programming.andP;  While the graphics editingelement of DataViews is simple enough, linking the interface to anapplication isn't.andP;  DV-Tools are programmer's tools.andP;  We looked at themanual.andP;  Heavy stuff.andM;Too heavy, perhaps, even for some developers.andP;  DataViews is great as long asyou stay within the confines of its predefined subroutines and as long asyou're not dealing with very complex applications.andP;  DataViews holds a lot ofinformation--attributes of an interface object (e.g., a graph), links ofattributes and data (e.g., having the graph pop up when a critical value isreached), attributes of attributes (e.g., changing the color of that graph,moving it, or including some animation), links of attributes of attributes todata, attributes of attributes of attributes...andP;  You can go layers deep, andit can get scary.andM;VI Corporation is targeting developers of command and control applications,CAD/CAM, network and process monitoring, instrument simulation, and financialanalysis.andP;  And the company has designed its product with these customers inmind.andP;  In other words, there's not much need to go beyond the scope of theproduct.andP;  Developers of different types of applications (perhaps office andmanufacturing applications) may need to look elsewhere.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
