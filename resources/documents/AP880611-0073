It also claimed that Afghanistan had made forays into itsairspace and territory.   ``The allegations made by the Kabul side were rejected, and apoint by point reply has been handed over to the United Nations,''said a Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The Pakistani official said the reply ``emphasized ... thatPakistan cannot be held responsible'' for guerrilla actions againstthe Kabul government inside Afghanistan.   ``Pakistan is also not expected to prohibit the legitimatepolitical activity of the Afghan refugees who represent asubstantial segment of the Afghan population,'' the spokesman said.   The United Nations sponsored an accord calling for withdrawalfrom Afghanistan of the Soviet troops helping the Afghan governmentin its 10-year-old war with anti-communist guerrillas.   Pakistan, Afghanistan, United States and the Soviet Union signedthe accord in Geneva on April 14.   Afghanistan repeatedly has charged that Pakistan is violatingthe agreement, which took effect May 15, by continuing to armguerrillas. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made thesame charge at the United Nations on Friday and said the UnitedStates, which supports the guerrillas, is partly to blame.   In addition to the United States, China and Pakistan have armedthe guerrillas during their struggle to oust the Afghan government.   Shevardnadze said as a result of the alleged violations, theSoviet Union may be obliged to review the nine-month schedule towithdraw its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan.   The Pakistani spokesman also said there had been air and groundviolations of Pakistan territory by the Afghan government andcalled this ``a serious breach'' of the Geneva accord. It did notelaborate on the alleged intrusions.   The Pakistani statement was given to the U.N. mission forAfghanistan and Pakistan in Islamabad. The mission undertakesinspections when it receives complaints of violations of the accord.   It has offices in Islamabad and Kabul.   Nearly 3 million Afghan refugees fled to Pakistan following theSoviet military intervention in Afghanistan in December 1979. Thebulk of the refugee population remains in Pakistan because of thefighting.</TEXT></DOC>
