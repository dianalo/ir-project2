By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.   But the court upheld California rulings that denied visitationrights to a man, identified only as Michael H., who says he is thefather of a 7-year-old girl, Victoria, born to a woman identified asCarol D. at a time when Carol D. was married to another man.   At issue was the constitutionality of a California law, similarto laws in many other states, that creates a presumption ofpaternity in favor of a woman's husband if a child is conceived andborn during their marriage.   Four high court members said men in similar circumstances toMichael H. have no constitutional right to a hearing wherevisitation rights could be won.   Four justices voted to strike down the California law, saying itinfringed on Michael H.'s constitutionally protected ``liberty.''   The key 9th vote was cast by Justice John Paul Stevens who votedto uphold the law, but said Michael H. had been ``given a fairopportunity to show that he is Victoria's natural father, that hehad developed a relationship with her, and that her interests wouldbe served by granting him visitation rights.''   Stevens, saying he was willing to ``assume'' that Michael H. andothers in similar circumstances have a right to a judicial hearingto establish paternity, said the California law does not violate theright because Michael H. received a chance to prove paternity andget visitation rights.   ``Because I am convinced that the trial judge had the authorityunder state law both to hear Michael's plea for visitation rightsand to grant him such rights if Victoria's best interests sowarranted, I am satisfied that the California statutory scheme is(constitutional),'' Stevens said.   Michael H. filed in a state court in Los Angeles a ``reversepaternity'' lawsuit in 1982, seeking to have himself declaredVictoria's father. His lawsuit was dismissed.   In upholding the dismissal, a state appeals court said the statelaw presumption of fatherhood in Carol D.'s husband, identified incourt records as Gerald D., was based ``upon a determination by thelegislature as a matter of overriding social policy that ... thehusband is to be held responsible for the child and the integrity ofthe family unit should not be impugned.''   Michael H. said he had enjoyed a father-child relationship withVictoria and that blood tests show a better-than-98-percent-chancethat Victoria is his biological daughter.   Michael H.'s appeal said that Victoria was born as a result of anaffair Carol D. had while she was married to Gerald D.   The appeal also said that Carol D. and Victoria moved to theVirgin Islands to live with Michael H. for several months in 1982after she and her husband were estranged.   Court records indicate that Carol and Gerald D. later resumedliving together.   Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy,wrote that Michael H. had no constitutional right to a judicialhearing to establish paternity.   Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshalland Harry A. Blackmun said he did have such a constitutional right.   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.</TEXT></DOC>
