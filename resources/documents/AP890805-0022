After weeks of intense wrangling and a last-minute legislativeshowdown, the Senate approved the Sandamp;L bill without a roll call.Shortly after midnight, the House then sent the package to Bush ona narrow 201-175 vote, with most of the chamber's ruling Democratsvoting against.   Bush is expected to sign the 1,000-page legislation, which wouldoverhaul the thrift industry.   One of the biggest hangups on the Sandamp;L bill was its impact on thefederal deficit and Bush's plan to keep the $159 billion cost``off-budget.'' Bush won a compromise from theDemocratic-controlled Congress by threatening a veto.   The Senate also gave voice vote approval and sent to Bush a billtemporarily adding $70 billion in new borrowing authority to theTreasury's current credit limit of $2.8 trillion.   The interim debt bill, which would expire Oct. 31, was approvedearlier in the week by the House. The bill is needed because apermanent debt ceiling increase to more than $3 trillion has boggeddown in the Senate, and without more borrowing authority thegovernment would default on its obligations this month.   The permanent debt bill is expected to become a legislativevehicle for a variety of amendments in the Senate after Congressreturns next month for its fall meeting.   Earlier Friday, the House ignored threats of a possible veto andpassed a $286.5 billion military spending bill that would slashbillions of dollars from Bush's strategic weapons programs.   The bill, approved 312-105, would cut $1.8 billion from StarWars, strictly curtail production of the B-2 bomber and eliminateall funds for the Midgetman nuclear missile, the advanced tacticalfighter and cruise missile.   Also Friday:   _The Senate approved an $18.4 billion spending bill for fiscal1989 operations of the Treasury, Postal Service, and othergovernment agencies.   The bill was approved only after a controversial amendment torestore Oliver North's military pension was put off until the fall,when it will be taken up as a separate bill.   Among the items in the spending bill is $200,000 to remodel theVice President Dan Quayle's official residence, to betteraccommodate his young family.   The measure contains $5.5 billion for the Internal RevenueService, $300 million more than this year, and $1.3 billion for theCustoms Service, $100 million above 1989 spending.   It also aims to prevent credit card companies from joining withcharities to seek business, and thus taking advantage of subsidizedmail rates.   Another part of the bill would suspend for one year enforcementof a tax law designed to encourage companies to give healthinsurance to low-level workers. Business groups have complainedthat the requirement is expensive and time-consuming.   _The House ethics committee announced it will conductpreliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill.;Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif.   Lukens was convicted in Ohio on a misdemeanor charge ofcontributing to the unruliness of a child for having sex with ateen-age girl.   Two former aides to Bates have filed a complaint alleging hesexually harassed female members of his staff.   Three Democrats filed a complaint against Savage after newsreports said a Peace Corps volunteer complained the congressmanfondled her while he was traveling in Zaire.   _Sen. David Durenberger, D-Minn., said the Senate ethicscommittee has decided to proceed with its investigation of his bookcontract that an opponent claimed was used to circumvent limits onoutside income.   _The Senate, in a bill reacting to the Exxon Valdez disaster,voted 99-0 to increase industry's financial liability for oilspills, create a nationwide system to clean up such accidents andestablish a $1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages.   _The House and Senate approved and sent to Bush a bill providing$895 million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by thedrought and other weather-related problems.</TEXT></DOC>
