The FTC has asked both parties for more informationinvolving the deal, which includes the 24-hour all-businesscable channel, in a motion filed late Thursday to U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Francis G. Conrad in New York under theHart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act. The FTC asked for a 20-daywaiting period once the new information is received. JudgeConrad hasn't yet ruled on the motion and couldn't be reachedfor comment. CNBC, or the Consumer News and Business Channel,is a unit of General Electric Co.'s NBC Cable division.</LP><TEXT>   In the 11-page FTC motion, the commission said theproposed transaction would &quot;eliminate&quot; CNBC's onlycompetition in the cable business news programming arena. TheFTC said another consideration was whether launching anotherall-business cable channel would be &quot;difficult. Thus, thetransaction must be carefully scrutinized for the possibilityof anti-competitive results.&quot; FNN declined comment and NBCsaid the FTC request was just routine.   The motion is the latest in a series of twists in theattempted sale of FNN, which is 47%-owned by New York-basedInfotechnology Inc.   On Feb. 25, CNBC said it signed a definitive agreement topurchase the media business assets of FNN and would merge thetwo entities. The last-minute bid scuttled an agreement inprinciple for FNN to sell its media business to a partnershipbetween Group W Satellite Communications -- a division ofWestinghouse Electric Co. -- and Dow Jones andamp; Co., whichpublishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine.   FNN filed for bankruptcy court-protection on March 1. OnMarch 7, Judge Conrad set parameters for a competing bid inthe FNN sale. Any new bid must be submitted by March 25 andJudge Conrad set April 3 as the hearing date on thetransaction and the date that final bids would be considered.Among the conditions, any new bid must be at least $10million over the $105 million submitted by CNBC.   In an interview Friday, Peter G. Skinner, senior vicepresident at Dow Jones, said the FTC motion doesn't affectthe Group W-Dow Jones partnership plan to resubmit a bid.&quot;We're in the process of considering whether to revise ourbid and we confirm our commitment to want to buy FNN and runit as an independent network.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
