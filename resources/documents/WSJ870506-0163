A spokesman for the utility said the company hasn't determined what effect the reductions will have on earnings.    The spokesman said also the company believes the reduction is &quot;much more than is appropriate or warranted,&quot; and that the decision probably will force it to seek a rate increase that would be effective in 1988. He said Baltimore Gas had submitted data to the commission indicating that a reduction in the range of $8 million to $10 million was justified.    A public service commission spokesman said the reduction was ordered after a nine-month study because Baltimore Gas's tax rate will fall to 34% from 46% for the 1987 tax year, and because of the &quot;significant improvement in the nation's financial markets, resulting in a decline in interest rates.&quot;    The spokesman said the commission believes the lower rates will allow Baltimore Gas to achieve &quot;a sufficient amount of revenue to meet its debt obligations and to fairly compensate stockholders without unduly burdening its ratepayers.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Baltimore Gas shares closed at $30.25, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
