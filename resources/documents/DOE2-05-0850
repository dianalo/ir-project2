<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0850 </DOCNO><TEXT>Monte Carlo applications have traditionally been limited by the largeamounts of computer time required to produce acceptably small statisticaluncertainties, so the immediate benefit of vectorization is an increasein either the number of jobs completed or the number of particles processedper job, typically by one order of magnitude or more. This results directlyin improved engineering design analyses, since Monte Carlo methods areused as standards for correcting more approximate methods. The relativelysmall number of vectorized programs is a consequence of the newness ofvectorized Monte Carlo, the difficulties of nonportability, and the verylarge development effort required to rewrite or restructure Monte Carlocodes for vectorization. Based on the successful efforts to date, itmay be concluded that Monte Carlo vectorization will spread to increasingnumbers of codes and applications. The possibility of multitasking provideseven further motivation for vectorizing Monte Carlo, since the step fromvector to multitasked vector is relatively straightforward.</TEXT></DOC>
