The study, the most comprehensive of its kind in Japan, will alsorecommend ways to improve the condition of the forests, YutakaKawanaka of the Forestry Agency said in a statement today.   Acid rain results from the mixture of rain and sulfur dioxide,nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants that enter the atmospheremainly as emissions from factories and electric power plants. Thestudy will begin April 1, 1990 and take samples from 1,200 locationswithin the nation's forests, Kawanaka said.   Until recently, Japan paid little attention to acid rain and thedamage it has caused. The United States and Europe have beenstudying the problem for some time, although critics say they havetaken few steps to stop acid rain.   ``Damage caused by acid rain has been negligible in Japan becausewe have rich, thick soil that is hard to acidify, whereas soil inEurope and the United States is thin and easily acidified,''Kawanaka said. ``Also, coniferous or evergreen trees, including thefir prevalent in Europe, are more easily damaged than thebroad-leaved deciduous forests we have in Japan.''   However, Japan's Environmental Agency recently reported theresults of a five-year survey that concluded that acid rain has beenfalling all over Japan. It did not specify whether damage has beendone.</TEXT></DOC>
