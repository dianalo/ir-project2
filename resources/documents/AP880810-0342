DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An attorney who was a central figure in theso-called ``Yuppie Five'' insider trading ring has been sentencedto four months in prison, by a judge who also contended the lawyershould be disbarred.   ``You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and helpto create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' U.S.District Judge John Keenan said before sentencing attorney MichaelDavid on Tuesday.   David pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminal countsfor his part in an insider trading scheme with three other WallStreet professionals and an investor.   The five, who all have pleaded guilty to various charges, allwere in their 20s at the time of the indictment.   David has admitted stealing clients' confidential corporateinformation from the law firm he once worked at and passing it onto the others.   The case was unrelated to insider trading cases involving IvanF. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine.   David, 30, of Manhattan, the last of the ``Yuppie Five'' toplead guilty after Keenan denied his pre-trial motions in late1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraudand obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Comnmissioninvestigation.   Defense attorney Darrell Fennell asked for leniency, saying thatDavid, once an associate at the the prominent New York law firm ofPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, faces disbarment andhas been driving a cab to support himself.   Visibly irritated, Keenan countered: ``I don't think anyoneshould confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's aprivelege!''   ``The very least he should face _ as far as I'm concerned _ isdisbarment,'' said Keenan.   Fennell said David was not a ``classic'' insider trader becausehe had not traded on the secret information he stole and did notmake any illegal profits.   But assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr., said Davidwas ``trying to make contacts and get a job in the arbitragecommunity.'' Arbitragers speculate on the stock of corporationsthat are potential merger or takeover targets.   David, dressed in a dark gray suit, told Keenan before sentencewas imposed that he regretted his conduct, and asked the judge foran opportunity ``to help rebuild my life as I have tried to do.''   Keenan sentenced David to four months in prison and four yearsprobation, and said he would have imposed a longer jail term if notfor David's cooperation with federal investigators.   Lowenson said David had cooperated extensively for almost twoyears with federal investigators and would be an importantgovernment witness if there were any future trials arising from theprobe.   Keenan did not impose a fine but David faces civil penalties ofbetween $50,000 and $150,000 under an SEC consent agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
