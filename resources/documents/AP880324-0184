Nicaragua denied its troops crossed the border.   A Foreign Ministry communique said a total of nearly 460Sandinistas crossed the border late Tuesday. An ``energeticprotest'' was filed with Nicaragua over the incident, it said.   It said 300 heavily armed Sandinistas entered about 8 p.m.Tuesday in the San Andres de Bocay region in Olancho province,where Sandinistas chased Contras back across the border last week.It is about 150 miles east of this capital city.   At the same time, 50 Nicaraguan soldiers entered at the villageof Pico Espanol in El Paraiso province. The village is about twomiles from the Nicaraguan border.   The statement, read to The Associated Press by telephone, didnot say if there were any confrontations in the areas or whetherthe troops were still believed to be inside the country.   In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, a Defense Ministry spokesmanwas asked about the report. ``That's negative,'' he said, speakingon condition of anonymity.   A Honduran military official had reported the new incursion onWednesday.   ``We don't know the purpose of this new entry and violation ofour country, but the situation is being studied by the highcommand,'' the official said.   ``It's a matter of small armed groups of Sandinistas. Because ofthat, the state of alert continues for all combat units of thearmed forces,'' said the source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The location was given as the San Andres de Bocay region inOlancho province, but no other details were available.   In Washington, a government source speaking on condition ofanonymity, said there had been unconfirmed reports that anestimated 300 Sandinista soldiers had entered Honduras.   The reported incursion did not affect peace talks then under waybetween top Sandinista and Contra officials in Nicaragua, eventhough both sides said their forces would stop fighting during thetalks. Late Wednesday, the talks produced an accord calling for a60-day cease-fire beginning April 1.   Earlier Wednesday, Pentagon officials in Washington had saidthat unless the military situation in Honduran changes, theapproximately 3,200 U.S. troops sent to Honduras last week wouldreturn home early next week.   The U.S. troops were ordered to Honduras as a show of forceafter 2,000 Sandinsta soldiers allegedly chased Contra rebels fromNicaragua into Honduras.</TEXT></DOC>
