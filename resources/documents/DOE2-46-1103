As the experiment,pellet of pig dung dried to 20% water content was burnt in the boilerto generate 40{sup 0}C hot water for floor heating of the pigsty. Forgenerating electricity by wind power, 2 generators were connected inparallel, rated power of which were 22 Kw. In case of burning the pigdung pellet, 40% of the energy was consumed for drying the pellet, only18% was applicable for floor heating though it was sufficient for theheating. Concerning the generation of electricity by wind power, 30%of required energy for infrared heating was supplied at generating efficiency10%. It was concluded that, for economical operation, at least scaleof 8000 pigs were neccessary to be competitive with the cost of classA heavy oil, and that the installing cost of the generator should becut to 1/10-1/5 for competing with cost of city electricity.
