Mr. Keating warned that Australia's budget success isn't enough to head off other economic perils. Specifically, he said interest rates are likely to remain high as the government tries to rein in an overheated economy, and he predicted Australia's big trade deficit would grow.    &quot;This government isn't prepared to countenance a premature fall in interest rates,&quot; Mr. Keating said in his budget message for the year ending June 30. &quot;Rates cannot and should not fall until it is economically responsible.&quot;    Among the economic clouds on the horizon, Mr. Keating said, is an expected increase in Australia's already hefty A$130 billion foreign debt -- much of which is owed by the private sector -- as the country's payments deficit widens. And he indicated that inflation probably won't fall significantly in fiscal 1990.    Mr. Keating forecast that economic growth will slow to 2.8% in the current year from an estimated 3.3% in the year just ended, though some treasury officials believe the latest estimate may have to be raised.    The budget news produced a lukewarm response from financial analysts. &quot;The government is concerned to portray a vision of {economic} growth slowing down and that in turn points to improvement in inflation and the current-account deficit,&quot; said Els Termaat, an economist at investment bank Fay, Richwhite Australia Ltd. But implicit in the government's forecasts, she said, is that any improvement &quot;really won't happen till next {fiscal} year.&quot;    The crux of Australia's economic problems is its foreign debt. Each monthly current-account deficit adds to the foreign debt and pushes up debt-servicing costs. &quot;It feeds on itself,&quot; said Andre Morony, chief economist at Bankers Trust Australia Ltd. Australia's goal must be to start posting trade surpluses so that it can cut its foreign debt and debt servicing costs, economists say.    Mr. Keating said that tight monetary policies will slow demand for imports and help curb the burgeoning current-account deficit. Still, he said the current-account gap is expected to widen to A$18.5 billion in the current year from A$17.4 billion last year.    Even though the federal government plans to repay around A$1.75 billion of its foreign debt, the nation's total foreign debt this year is expected to balloon to nearly A$150 billion because of the current-account deficit. </TEXT></DOC>
