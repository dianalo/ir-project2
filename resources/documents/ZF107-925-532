Alongside will be &quot;significant portions&quot; of IBM's AIXoperating system, networking Streams technology from Mentat Inc, and the BSD4.4 network file system code from the University of California at Berkeley.andO;The aim is to create an operating system composed of modular elements with asmall secure micro-kernel, a set of extensible server processes andtransparent shared libraries for backward compatibility.andP;  And the move awayfrom any dependence on ATandamp;T code is highlighted in the latest set of writtenmaterial from the Foundation, which avoids any mention of the Unix trademarkthroughout, and therefore does not have to credit ATandamp;T as the trademarkholder.andP;  The Mentat contribution will be its Portable Streams Environmentsoftware, a fully compatible superset of ATandamp;T Streams which is also availablefor other environments, including VAX/VMS, Novell's NetWare 386 andintelligent network boards, with OS/2 and other operating systemimplementations in progress.andP;  Over and above Streams as implemented in UnixV.3, Portable Streams Environment supports fully asynchronous input-output,and scheduling and synchronisation mechanisms that, according to the company&quot;allow real-time and multiple CPU operating systems to exploit Streamscapabilities more fully&quot;.andP;  The product was developed &quot;entirely from ATandamp;T'spublicly available Streams specifications&quot;.andP;  The new plan means that theFoundation will be in a competitive position with ATandamp;T's Unix System V.4.1(the secure version) and V.4.2 (the multi-processing version) by the end of1990.andP;  There is apparently some question among Foundation members as towhether the description of the two next releases of ATandamp;T Unix have changedover the last months, and whether these versions were once called Unix SystemV.5.andP;  The forthcoming Unix roadmap expected from Unix International shouldfinally set this in concrete.andP;  According to an Hewlett-Packard spokesman,there was a lot of fear after the Foundation's Monte Carlo meeting in Maythat it would take two years to complete OSF/1, because of the AIX problem.andO;But intensive work since then has cut the timescale down to this latestschedule.andP;  Because of press reports that Hewlett wants to get out of theFoundation, the company has been getting a stream of calls from other membersasking whether it it is true.andP;  Hewlett said it would like to squash therumours, but without disrupting the peace talks now in progress.andP;  Accordingto Glen Osaka, manager of Open Systems Software Planning, Hewlett stillprefers the notion of OSF/1 over System V.4 because of the modularity of thekernel, which enables different parts to be selected for differentapplications.andP;  - John Abbott</TEXT></DOC>
