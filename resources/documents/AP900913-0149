Military post offices collect the mail and then turn it over topostal officials for delivery in this country.   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank had said Wednesday that hisagency was prepared to accept and deliver mail, without stamps,from personnel serving in Operation Desert Shield.   But, on Thursday, the Defense Department said letters withoutstamps cannot be accepted until Congress and President Bush approvethe action. The plan has passed the Senate and is pending in theHouse.   The House had appeared poised to approve the plan overwhelminglyuntil Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., offered an amendment stipulatingthat money to pay for the free mail would come from appropriationsfor free franked mail by members of Congress.   Ridge's proposal was rejected on a voice vote. He then demandeda roll call vote, and because the House had already agreed to holdno more recorded votes this week, the members postponed actionuntil next week.   Pentagon spokesman Glen Flood said ``current law does notauthorize free mail for deployed forces in situations short ofhostilities. We hope the full Congress takes action soon, but as ofright now free mail is not authorized. We hope that changes.''   Advised of the Pentagon decision, the Postal Service said thatits announcement of free mail from troops in Saudi Arabia ``wasmade in the spirit and intent of proposed legislation.''   ``The Postal Service stands ready to accept and deliver servicemen and women's free mail when received,'' the agency said.</TEXT></DOC>
