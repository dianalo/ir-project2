The government will present draft bills on the right ofassociation and assembly to parliament next month, governmentspokesman Gyoergy Marosan said Thursday.   According to the official news agency MTI, Justice MinisterKalman Kulcsar said the right of association bill would allowindividuals and legal entities to set up ``political parties, tradeunion, interest representations and other social organizations.''   However, he said another law still being drafted would regulatethe establishment of political parties, the news agency reported.   This law will determine the status of political parties and willprobably be included in the new constitution, the agency said. Thenew constitution is not expected to be ready before 1990.   There has been extensive debate in Hungary in recent weeks overwhat some communist leaders and political analysts in Hungary see asthe inevitable development of a multi-party system.   The media have carried comment by a wide variety of people on howviable a multi-party system would be under certain conditions.   Kulcsar reportedly said if the law on associations is approved byparliament it would amount to the recognition of a multi-partysystem.   But the leading role of Hungary's only political party, theHungarian Socialist Workers' Party, will remain until the newconstitution is adopted, the news agency reported.   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland each have small partiesthat are formally independent of the ruling communist party.However, these small parties have virtually no voice in theirpolitical systems.   A second draft bill, permitting the right of assembly, wouldregulate the holding of demonstrations.   Kulcsar said any planned assembly or demonstration must bereported to authorities three days in advance ``to maintain order.''Police would only have the right to ban an assembly ``if there isintention to commit a crime, or violation of the rights and freedomsof others,'' the news agency reported.   However, Kulcsar said in the event of a ban, an appeal could belodged, which would have to be handled in three days.   The government passed a resolution allowing conscientiousobjectors to work at an alternative service doing mostly manuallabor for 36 months. Mandatory military service lasts 18 months.   Hungary would be the second Soviet bloc country to introduce analternative service after Poland.   It was not clear from the agency report who would be entitled todo an alternative service. So far only Jehovah's Witnesses andmembers of the Church of Nazarene have been permitted to withdrawfrom military service on grounds of religious belief.</TEXT></DOC>
