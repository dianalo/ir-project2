For the quarter, Quick andamp; Reilly earned $4.2 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $3.4 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The latest quarter included a $3 million reserve for unsecured debits, which the company said it is &quot;vigorously pursuing.&quot; Revenue increased 49% to $28.2 million from $18.9 million.    In addition, the company increased its quarterly dividend 9% to six cents a share and declared a special year-end dividend of 12 cents a share. Both dividends are payable April 1 to stock of record March 1. In 1987, the company paid a special year-end dividend of 10 cents a share.    Leslie C. Quick Jr., chairman, said the firm expects &quot;calendar 1988 volume to be below 1987,&quot; but &quot;anticipates satisfactory performance in terms of profits and margins.&quot; He declined to be any more specific.    For the nine months, Quick andamp; Reilly's earnings rose 20% to $13.4 million, or $1.42 a share, from $11.1 million, or $1.17 a share, in the fiscal 1987 period. Revenue increased 24% to $79.3 million from $64 million. </TEXT></DOC>
