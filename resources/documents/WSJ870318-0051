The figures were disclosed in the FDIC's unaudited financial statement, approved by the agency's board yesterday. The FDIC insurance fund, which backs deposits of $1.5 trillion at 14,800 banks, had reserves of $18.2 billion on Dec. 31, according to the statement.    At the end of 1985, the insurance fund had a $1.4 billion surplus after a $1.6 billion provision for losses. It ended the year with reserves of $17.9 billion.    Last year, 138 federally insured banks failed, a post-Depression record. So far this year, 44 banks have failed, nearly double the number at the same time last year. FDIC officials, however, don't expect failures to continue at that rate, and Chairman William Seidman has predicted that as many as 150 banks could fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
