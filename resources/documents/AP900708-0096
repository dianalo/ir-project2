The announcement was foreseen a year ago when Bush decided toseek new controls on the sources of acid rain, an issue Canada hasbeen complaining about for a decade.   Both houses of Congress have passed different versions oflegislation requiring utility smokestacks to reduce extensivelyemissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, the principal rawmaterials causing acid rain.   Environmentalists monitoring the economic summit welcomed theannouncement and said it was inevitable.   In a session before the summit officially begins Monday, Bushand Mulroney set an informal timetable for talks to begin on an airpollution agreement.   William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, will meet with his counterpart, Robert de Cotret, inOttawa, Canada, on July 16, the leaders said. Formal negotiationsshould begin shortly after that, they said.   ``I think this day will be long remembered in the history of ourrelationship for the significant departure it constitutes from pastpositions,'' Mulroney said. He and other Canadian leaders have beenrebuffed in the past in their attempt to prod the United Statesinto curbing pollutants.   A White House announcement said the talks with Canada wouldcover monitoring of emissions, exchange of information andsettlement of disputes.   Scientists on both sides of the border agree about half the acidrain falling in eastern Canada originates from emissions generatedby utilities and smokestacks in the United States. Because of windpatterns, about a quarter of the acid rain falling in theAdirondack Mountains of New York States originates in Canada.   Former President Reagan argued that not enough was known toconclude that acid rain was a serious problem; Canada said marinelife in as many as 14,000 lakes is in jeopardy.   Environmentalists, meanwhile, denounced what they said was thefailure of the seven summit nations to live up to the rhetoric oflast year's meeting in Paris in which they pledged to protect theworld's environment.   The leaders agreed in 1989 to end production of chemicals thatdestroy the earth's protective ozone layer, said George T.Frampton, president of The Wilderness Society.   ``The reality is that our forests are being cut just as fast asthey were a year ago, Frampton said. ``Carbon dioxide and othergreenhouse gases are being emitted into the atmosphere at just thesame high volume, or even greater, than that of a year ago.Population growth and ocean pollution have continued unabated.''   An environmental coalition of 150 groups is keeping a scorecarddesigned to hold governments accountable by publicizing theirrecords, Frampton said.   The environmentalists have already ranked the countriesattending the summit.   West Germany was rated top, followed by France, Britain, Canada,the United States, Japan and Italy.   The countries were ranked based on their policies on conservingenergy and reducing the threat of global warming; protectingbiological diversity such as that found in tropical forests,abating pollution of the oceans, controlling population growth,helping the cleanup of Eastern Europe and helping develoing nations.   Germany's high score was ``the best of a bad lot,'' said JayHair, executive vice president of the National Wildlife Federation.</TEXT></DOC>
