A message from the Greenpeace vessel Gondwana at King GeorgeIsland said the Soviet official had at first refused to do anythingabout the accumulation of waste at the Bellingshausen base on theisland, about 600 miles from the southern tip of South America.   ``The result of this action is a small but significant stepforward for the protection of the Antarctic,'' said Maj DePoorter,the Belgian leader of the Greenpeace mission in a message to theorganization headquarters in Britain.   Martin Leeburn, Greenpeace's spokesman in London, said theSoviets reversed their stand after more than 20 Greenpeace memberscollected rubbish from around the Soviet station and sent a protestto the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Institute in Leningrad.   He said the protest reported 40 bags of garbage had beencollected and returned to the leader of the Soviet station with ademand that the rubbish be removed and disposed of properly.   Ms. DePoorter, in her report, said that on Sunday the Greenpeacemembers began to demonstrate as the Soviet resupply ship, AkademikFyodorov, anchored offshore. Greenpeace said the Soviet vessel hasa cargo capacity of more than 5,000 tons and was scheduled to leavethe station empty.   Leeburn said that after a ``brief confrontation,'' the Sovietofficial, who was not identified, ordered his personnel to load thegarbage aboard the ship for removal from Antarctica.   Ms. DePoorter said in her message that the Greenpeace expeditionwas told by the Soviet station leader on Friday that none of therubbish accumulated around the base over many years would beremoved.   She said, ``The rubbish consisted of food scraps, empty bottles,all sorts of glass receptacles, cans, old radio equipment, doors,windows, beds, drums with rotten food, rusty propellers, enginesand piles of plastic ... all scattered over about 200 meters(yards)`` and half covered by snow.   Leeburn said the Gondwana went to King George Island to check onthe operations of the various stations. Garbage and other debrisdoes not decay in the cold and becomes a threat to the purity ofthe wilderness and its wildlife, he said.   He said the Greenpeace group reported the Bellingshausenstation, established in 1968, has a normal complement of about 29people and twice as many in summer, ``which is now.''   ``The Soviet station has no waste treatment plant, it burnsrubbish in open pits and sends nothing back to the Soviet Union,''he said.   Greenpeace said eight countries are active on King George Island_ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Poland, the Soviet Union, SouthKorea and Uruguay.</TEXT></DOC>
