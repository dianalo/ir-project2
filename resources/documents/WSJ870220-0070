The company cited a loss at the Hill andamp; Knowlton public relations unit, sharply lower operating profit at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency and operating losses in countries where tax benefits aren't currently available.    In the year-earlier period, JWT earned $8 million, or 81 cents a share. The company had said it expected to report a fourth-quarter loss. Revenue rose 6% to $176 million.    JWT has long had financial problems largely because of soaring costs, analysts say. But analysts nonetheless didn't expect the weak fourth-quarter results and many were predicting a profit.    For the year, JWT reported that profit dropped 69% to $5.9 million, or 60 cents a share, from $19.4 million, or $1.97 a share. The year-ago figures are restated for the pooling of interests of the Gray andamp; Co. unit that Hill andamp; Knowlton acquired last October. Revenue for the year rose 11% to $641 million.    The 1986 earnings include charges for severance payments, acquisition costs, and write-downs of European operations, and provisions for duplicate leases, bad debts and relocation costs. These charges totaled about $12 million before tax in 1986, including almost $11 million in the fourth quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
