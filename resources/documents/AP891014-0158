(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder forced a frownand gave his audience of college students a parody of the questionshe and Republican J. Marshall Coleman have heard dozens of times intheir campaign for governor.   ``Can it really be taking place here in Virginia?'' Wilderasked, his voice mocking the astonished tones of an outsider. ``Arethey really going to do that there? What sort of poison have theypoured in the water down there? What are those people drinking?''   Wilder, the state's 58-year-old lieutenant governor, andColeman, a 47-year-old former attorney general, are deadlocked inpolls on the state's most expensive battle for governor _ $20million and growing.   If Wilder wins on Nov. 7, he would become the first blackelected governor of any state.   Yet strikingly, in a campaign that has captured nationalattention because a black man is vying for the top office in theflagship of the Confederacy, both candidates have avoided more thanpassing mention of race. The chief issues have been abortion andcrime.   Nonetheless, race has had a major impact on the campaign, saysLarry Sabato, a University of Virginia government professor _ it'sjust been the opposite of what was expected.   ``Clearly, Wilder's race is a net plus for him,'' Sabato said.``It gets him loads of free and favorable national publicity. Itproduces national money. It insulates him from many charges.   ``And it's a status symbol for upper- and middle-class suburbanwhites to vote for him. It's objective proof that they're notracist,'' the professor said.   Coleman says Virginians see the contest ``just as two candidatesrunning for office.'' Standing in the shadows of the Blue RidgeMountains where he spent his youth, he said Wilder wants to takethe state back ``to the days of higher taxes, high interest ratesand high inflation.''   Wilder also portrays Coleman as a ``turn the clock back''candidate who wants to return to the time when abortions wereillegal and progress was measured by the bulldozers of big-moneyreal estate developers.   To get where they are, both candidates have beaten the odds.   Wilder became Virginia's first black statewide officeholder andthe highest-ranking elected state official of his race in thecountry when he won the No. 2 office in 1985. That was after 16years in the Virginia Senate, where he was the first black sinceReconstruction.   Coleman was the only Republican to become attorney general thiscentury and, when he won the post in 1977 at age 34, its youngestoccupant ever. After he lost the 1981 race for governor to DemocratCharles S. Robb, Coleman was written off by his party, but hescored a comeback by winning the state's first GOP gubernatorialprimary in 40 years.   The current governor, Democrat Gerald L. Baliles, is barred bythe state Constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.   A Richmond Times-Dispatch poll published Oct. 1 found 42 percentfor Wilder and 40 percent for Coleman, with the remainderundecided. The poll's margin of error was four percentage pointseither way.   Partly because of the primary, the campaign has passed $20million in fund-raising. Coleman has pulled in $8.2 million _ morethan a third of it from real estate developers in fast-growingnorthern Virginia, a point that Wilder has used against him _ toWilder's $4.8 million. But Coleman spent much of his war chest inthe primary. As of Oct. 1, Wilder had $1.6 million in the bank toColeman's $925,000.   Wilder, who is expected to get nearly all of the approximately17 percent black vote in the state, has tried hard not to alienatemoderate whites, who gave Democrats the top state offices in thelast two elections while voting solidly for Republicans RonaldReagan and George Bush.   When a Labor Day college fraternity gathering of 100,000 blackyouths in Virginia Beach erupted into riots, he refused to joinother black leaders who accused the resort city's leaders of beinghostile to minority visitors.   Coleman has said he will not concede the black vote and will notlet Wilder use race as a shield to hide behind what Coleman calls aliberal voting record.   Wilder has made Coleman's anti-abortion views the focus of atelevision ad and has pressed the GOP contender on whether he wouldsign legislation restricting abortions. He also says Coleman, whosesupport from evangelical conservatives helped him win the primary,would make abortion a litmus test for appointees, a charge Colemandenies.   ``He has been seeking to exploit a very emotional issue and todistort my record,'' Coleman said in a televised debate last week.``I think that issue now should be put to rest.''   Last week, Coleman countered with his own TV commercialdepicting Wilder as insensitive to women for having introduced abill in 1972 that would have allowed defense attorneys tointerrogate rape victims 13 and under about their sex lives. Wilderpress secretary Laura F. Dillard said Wilder submitted the bill fora constituent and did not support it or vote for it.   Coleman has tried to make Wilder appear soft on crime byresurrecting a 12-year-old vote against a ``cop killer'' deathpenalty bill. The Republican has also played up his endorsement bythe state's Fraternal Order of Police, an endorsement Wilder won in1985. Wilder said he supports Virginia's capital punishment law.   The only black governor in U.S. history was Pinckney B.S.Pinchback of Louisiana. He became lieutenant governor in 1871 andmoved up to the post of acting governor for six weeks in 1872-1873after the governor was impeached.   In recent years, major parties have nominated two blackpoliticans for governorships. In 1982 and 1986, Los Angeles MayorThomas Bradley ran as California's Democratic candidate forgovernor, losing both times to Republican George Deukmejian. In1986, Michigan Republican William Lucas failed to unseat DemocraticGov. James J. Blanchard.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, Oct. 17</NOTE></DOC>
