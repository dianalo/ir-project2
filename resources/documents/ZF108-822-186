 The company saysthat due to hardware enhancements in the ES/9000, ES/3090-9000T, and 3090180J, 200J, 280J, and above, DB2, can provide up to a 37% reduction inelapsed time and up to a 62% reduction in CPU time for DB2 queries using sortrunning under MVS/ESA Version 3 Release 1.3 and DB2 Version 2 Release 3.andO;Hidden among its enterprise data strategy, the following announcements arealso to be found: a new version of Query Management Facility; new softwaretool called Data Propagator MVS/ESA; an SAA application that provides a newnatural language query, SAA LanguageAccess, and a new release of IMS/ESA DB.andO;Using IBM's SAA Distributed Relational Database Architecture announced inJune (CI No 1,460), customers can distribute data between DB2 systems underMVS, and SQL/DS relational databases under VM, regardless of where the datais stored.andP;  Users will need only to request the data and their system willretrieve it automatically, giving customers wider and more efficient use ofdata on VM and MVS.andP;  DB2 and SQL/DS have implemented Remote-Unit-of-Workbased on the distributed architecture.andP;  In addition, this architecture willprovide the basis for distributed remote unit of work support for the SAAOS/2 Extended and AS/400 database managers when (when indeed) distributedsupport to multiple database systems is available in those SAA environments.andO;This means that users or application programs can access information inrelational databases from any SAA or non-SAA system that fully implements thearchitecture in its enterprise.andP;  Meanwhile, Data Propagator MVS/ESA, isdesigned to help IMS/ESA DB and DB2 coexist.andP;  It does this by ensuring thatdata remains current and consistent on a DB2 database when it is changed onan IMS/ESA database, without user intervention.andP;  The system has the option tomake all changes immediately or at user-controlled intervals.andP;  This shouldcomplement existing IMS production applications with DB2 relational databasesfor decision-support query and reporting, and the data can be kept as currentas desired.andP;  New distributed retrieval functions in Query Management Facilityprovide transparent access to distributed relational data on DB2 and SQL/DSdatabases, regardless of their location.andP;  Support for two new QueryManagement Facility operating environments, CICS/MVS and CICS/ESA were alsoannounced.andP;  The new IBM SAA LanguageAccess natural language query productenables users to request information in simple English, rather than inprogramming commands.andP;  With SAA LanguageAccess, business professionals withlittle data processing training or experience can enter a request in theirown words.andP;  IBM SAA LanguageAccess then translates the request into SQLlanguage for Query Management Facility which then retrieves the informationenabling the advanced reporting, graphics and other functions of the facilitycan be used.andM;VM now part of SAA, MVS has APPCSAA ImagePlus has been enhanced as the OS/2version of the ImagePlus Workstation provides a co-operative processingfront-end to SAA ImagePlus MVS/ESA and SAA ImagePlus System/400 and whenimplemented to SAA customer user access guidelines, provides a new level ofend user interaction.andP;  Furthermore, operating systems are restructured tobetter support SAA co-operative processing: MVS/ESA includes Advanced Programto Program Communications and the SAA Communications Interface VM/ESA is nowa full SAA system with all host SAA Common Programming Interface elements.andM;SystemView has three parts, stands adjacent to AD/Cycle, belongs to SAAIBMtook the opportunity to flesh out its SAA strategy further.andP;  This includedthe release of SAA Common Communications Support through new SAA Data BaseManagers for System/370 and System/390 for Distributed Relational DatabaseArchitecture, Distributed Data Management, Formatted Data Object ContentArchitecture, and Character Data Representation Architecture all announcedearlier this summer (CI No 1,460).andP;  But the prima donna as far as SAA wasconcerned was SystemView which is an architecture to manage the enterprisecomputing environment - like AD/Cycle and SAA it is not itself a product, itis a concept.andP;  However SAA encompasses both AD/Cycle and SystemView whichcould both be described as processes within the SAA architecture - AD/Cycleto develop SAA, SystemView to manage the SAA environment once it isdeveloped.andP;  At present SystemView has three dimensions for: the end user,applications and a repository.andP;  In terms of the end user, Common User Accessis standard via OS/2 and Presentation Manager on programmable workstations.andO;As for applications IBM intends to have architected interfaces defined andimplemented to conform to SystemView standards.andP;  At this point all it has,however is SAA Asset Manager/MVS which is an automated businessadministration product, and SAA Delivery Manager, providing a means ofcustomising, controlling, and delivering programs and files from an MVS or VMhost processor to IBM OS/2 programmable workstations.andP;  Consequently, mostapplications are coming from software partners such as Legent Internationalwhich, according to international marketing director Graham Burton, has beenworking with IBM for seven months to ensure that products such as AutoMatemirror the SystemView strategy.andP;  The repository is still a rather shadowypart of SystemView with an as yet undefined relational data model.andP;  However,the Information System must access a single database via SAA SQL and the datamodel between SystemView and AD/Cycle should be consistent.andP;  As forSystem-View encompassing a heterogenous multi-vendor environment, Burtonthinks such a reality is many miles down the road, and IBM has not publiclyaddressed the technical practicalities of this reality at all.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
