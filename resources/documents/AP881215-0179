Manuel Antonio Noriega, the de facto ruler of Panama,the U.S. ambassador says.   Bush ``will not be disposed to abandon the pressure for changeand democracy in Panama ... no matter what Noriega might want,''Ambassador Arthur Davis told a dinner Wedneday night of the AmericanChamber of Commerce and Industry of Panama. The embassy released hisremarks Thursday.   Davis said the United States would end sanctions when Noriegaresigned as as commander of the Panamanian military, a position heuses to control the country.   ``The beginning of political stability only can be achieved ifNoriega relinquishes power,'' Davis said.   Noriega is under U.S. indictment on charges of drug traffickingand money laundering. He denies the accusations.   ``In 1988, we have observed in Panama a progressive deteriorationof human rights, a growing disdain for justice and respect for laws,the unconstitutional ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle, andthe loss of confidence in the economy,'' Davis declared.   He said the government nominally led by President Manuel SolisPalma was unconstitutional. Noriega arranged Delvalle's dismissal bythe National Assembly on Feb. 26, after Delvalle had tried to firethe general.   Davis said U.S. sanctions were not to blame for Panama's economiccrisis and were not meant to hurt the Panamanian people.   ``The Panamanian economy cannot begin its recovery unless thepolitical crisis of this country is resolved in a satisfactorymanner for all Panamanians,'' he said.   Economic sanctions, which which forbid U.S. operations to paytaxes to Panama, ``are doing what they were created to do: they'repreventing cash from reaching the hands of an illegal regime,''Davis said.   Noriega claims Washington seeks an excuse to violate the 1977treaties under which control of the Panama Canal will be given toPanama on Dec. 31, 1999. Davis said canal security can be guaranteedonly with ``genuine progress toward democracy and a civilian andconstitutional government in Panama.''   Davis said presidential elections scheduled for May 7 would beworthless if Noriega remained in his post.   ``As long as Noriega clings to power, we don't believe that theelections can be accepted by Panamanians as the product of anauthentic process,'' he said.   Most opposition parties take a similar position, arguing thatsufficient election and press guarantees do not exist. Thegovernment has closed three newspapers, three radio stations and atelevision station.</TEXT></DOC>
