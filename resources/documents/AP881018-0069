Leaders from the country's two largest republics, Serbia andCroatia, clashed openly as the party's 162-member Central Committeemet today for a second day to discuss personnel and policy changes.   ``The way out of the crisis is not in extraordinary measures butin a change of behavior,'' President Raif Dizdarevic told thesession, referring to unspecified actions he threatened to takelast week if workers continued to stage mass rallies fueled byeconomic and ethnic problems.   ``The lack of unity in the leadership, multiplying of late, is agreat danger for the country,'' he added. ``Yugoslavia isfront-page news all around the world, unfortunately in a negativeway.''   Dizdarevic spoke to the country's top leaders, includingCommunist Party chief Stipe Suvar, who planned to end the CentralCommittee session today with a vote of confidence in 10 members ofthe 23-member ruling Politburo.   Josip Vrhovec, one of nine members of Yugoslavia's federalpresidency, attacked Serbian party chief Slobodan Milosevic, whosesupporters have dominated the rallies.   Using a statement Milosevic allegedly made to an Austrianweekly, Vrhovec _ who is from the republic of Croatia _ demandedthat Milosevic use his influence to stop the denunciations ofCommunist Party leaders in the media and at the protests.   Milosevic countered that he had never made the statement orgiven any interview to foreign media. Vrhovec apologized.   Kosovo's Communist Party leader, Katjusa Jasari, told themeeting the only way to solve the problems of her backward southernprovince was for the ethnic Albanian majority to unite with theSlav minority in confronting economic problems. The Slavs claimthey are harassed by the ethnic Albanians.   During Monday's session, Suvar backed a market-oriented economicreform program being considered by Parliament to fight the 217percent annual inflation rate and $21 billion foreign debt.   Milosevic on Monday launched an impassioned defense of the massrallies that have fanned ethnic unrest and party disunity.   Marko Orlandic, the party chief of the southern republic ofMontenegro, said 10 members of the Politburo are expected to facetoday's vote of confidence, including party chief Suvar. Orlandicsaid the 10 will need at least two-thirds of the Central Committeevotes to retain their seats on the ruling body.   The confidence vote will be conducted by secret ballot, he said.   It will not apply to the four Presidium members who announcedprior to the current Central Committee that they would resign, hesaid.   It also does not apply to nine members of the 23-man ruling bodywho hold their seats as party leaders of Yugoslavia'a six republicsand two provinces, and the armed forces.   Milosevic, who has antagonized non-Serbs, is among those exemptfrom the vote of confidence.   Milosevic is trying to extend Serbian control over hisrepublic's two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.   But Milosevic insisted Monday that ``Serbia has no claims to theterritory of other republics. It does have claim to territory inits own republic.''   Milosevic's drive has brought him into unprecedented openconflict with Suvar and the Communist Party chief of the northernrepublic of Slovenia, Milan Kucan. The three men are Yugoslavia'smost important communist leaders.   On Monday, Kucan lent unreserved support to Suvar's appeal forunity and economic reform to ease social tensions.   The economic reform program has been worked out by thegovernment under Premier Branko Mikulic, who survived a vote ofconfidence in May but came under severe criticism Monday forfailing to control the economic crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
