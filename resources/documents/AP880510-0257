Michael S. Dukakis in his campaign for the 1988Democratic nomination for president:      Three decades ago, the Soviet Union launched the first satelliteinto space. It was called Sputnik; and many said that it spelledthe end of America's technological and economic leadership in theworld.   We could have accepted that judgment. We could have sat back andsettled in and gone along as we were. Making excuses. Taking iteasy. Living in the past.   Instead, we elected a new president. John Kennedy awakened oursense of possibility. He rekindled our idealism. He gave usconfidence. And he raised the stars and stripes so high theyliterally reached the moon.   And when John Kennedy accepted the Democratic nomination in1960, he said that ``today, our concern must be with the future.For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways willnot do.''   Today, as in 1960, we're in a battle for the economic future ofAmerica. And now, as then, the old ways simply will not do.   This fall, the Republican Party is going to be asking Americansto keep things as they are. But I say we have to change. And I saywe must change. I say we must make change work for us, not againstus.   Because during the past seven years, I've seen too many peoplethrown out into the streets after decades on the job.   I've listened to too many people who work hard from dawn tomidnight every day and still can't pay their bills.   I've talked to too many students who have the skills and theenergy and the ambition to go to college but not the money.   I've read too many stories about how America is supposed to bein decline; about how our children will have to settle for asecond-rate economy and a second-class future.   I don't buy that.   We Americans aren't about to write off a whole generation ofyoung people.   We're not about to accept an America where all we do is flipeach other's hamburgers and take in each other's laundry for $3.35an hour.   We're not about to sit on the sidelines while our neighbors arethrown out of work and America's home towns are boarded up and leftto die.   As a New Englander, I've seen what happens when good, decent,hard-working people lose their jobs. I've seen what happens totheir families and to their communities. I saw it in Lowell andHaverhill, Mass., when the textile mills and shoe factories myparents had worked in when they first came to this country pulledup stakes and headed south. I saw it when carpenters andbricklayers and ironworkers had to leave their homes and familiesand travel hundreds of miles to find construction work in otherstates.   Over the past decade, in communities all over Ohio and Indianaand throughout the Midwest, we've seen the same kind of pain andagony and uncertainty that we lived through in New England duringthe '50s and '60s and early '70s.   We see people struggling to make ends meet. We see communitiesstruggling to rebuild in the face of changing technology and toughforeign competition.   We see governors like Dick Celeste, and mayors and communityleaders throughout this region struggling to create a bright futurefor their citizens.   That's why this election is so important.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
