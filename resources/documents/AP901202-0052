The Iraqi leader also said Iraq does not posses nuclear arms,and he defended the holding of foreign hostages.   The interview, with the French network Antenne 2, was the firstSaddam has granted to a foreign television network since the U.N.Security Council last week adopted a resolution authorizing forceagainst Iraq if its troops remained in Kuwait as of Jan. 15.   The Iraqi president repeatedly refused to respond to questionsabout a possible Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, which his forceshave occupied since Aug. 2.   But in the interview, taped in Baghdad Saturday, Saddam said hewas ready to talk with U.S. officials if they came ``in a spirit ofdialogue'' and did not set preconditions.   He said the holding of an estimated 3,000 Western hostages was``one of the means that we think is capable of preventing war.''   He said if the United States wanted the hostages freed, itshould pledge that it will not resort to force prior to March 25.   The Iraqi president had offered earlier to free all the hostagesbetween Christmas and March 25 if nothing happens to mar ``theatmosphere of peace.''   The Antenne 2 interviewer asked Saddam about the chances of warin the region. ``Fifty-fifty,'' the Iraqi leader replied.   Elaborating on that, he cited the U.S. offer to send Secretaryof State James A. Baker III to Baghdad for talks.   ``If they want to make this meeting a raal path toward dialogue,then we are closer to peace,'' he said.   ``But if they want to make this meeting nothing other than aformal exhibition for the American Congress, the American people orinternational public opinion, simply to give themselves goodconscience to say, `There, we've tried to dialogue with Iraq,without Iraq renouncing its positions' - in that case, we're closerto war.''   Saddam denied that his government possessed nuclear weapons, butsaid he would let the world know if that were the case.   ``But we don't possess nuclear arms,'' he said.   U.S. officials have raised the possibility of Iraq developingnuclear capability in coming years, and said that would be onereason to move against Saddam.</TEXT></DOC>
