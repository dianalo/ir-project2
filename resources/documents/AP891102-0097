The Vietnamese-backed government forces fired Soviet-made 130mmcannons and 122mm rockets into Thmar Puok in western Battambangprovince on Wednesday, according to the resistance group led byCambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   It said 55,000 civilians live in Thmar Puok, one of severaltowns the guerrillas captured in early October along Route 69 inthe province, which borders Thailand.   No mention was made of casualties in Wednesday's shelling, butthe group said one civilian was killed and eight wounded whengovernment forces last shelled the area Oct. 23.   The guerrillas seized Thmar Puok as part of their advance toSvay Chek, the only big town blocking the way to the government'smilitary center of Sisophon, 25 miles south of Thmar Puok.   On Wednesday, the official Phnom Penh radio said governmentforces launched operations to clear Route 69 and that the enemy wasrouted in one village in the area.   But a resistance official, Abdulgaffar Peang-Meth, said Thursdaythat Svay Chek ``is strangled and our forces have blocked off allthe access routes. Svay Chek will fall like a ripe fruit when thetime comes.''   Abdulgaffar said few guerrillas have been killed in the battlefor Svay Chek, but many have been wounded by artillery shelling andland mines.   Abdulgaffar is the main military analyst of the Khmer People'sNational Liberation Front. The front and Sihanouk's forces, bothnon-communist, are joined with the Communist Khmer Rouge in aguerrilla coalition fighting the government Vietnam installed inCambodia after invading in late 1978.   All three groups have made significant battlefield advancessince late September, when Vietnam staged what it called thewithdrawal of its last troops from the country.   Cambodia's official SPK news agency said Thursday thatauthorities had instituted a nighttime curfew in Battambang, andnot martial law as reported by a Thai newspaper a day earlier.   The Khmer Rouge guerrilla army has said it is advancing on theprovincial capital at Battambang, the country's second-largestcity, after taking the nearby strategic town of Pailin on Oct. 22.   SPK, monitored in Bangkok, said the reported threat of a KhmerRouge attack on Battambang was merely propaganda to boost the KhmerRouge's standing at the United Nations. The General Assembly issoon to debate the issue of Cambodia's seat at the world body, nowheld by the guerrilla coalition.   The fall of Pailin has heightened fears of the return of theKhmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of people when itruled Cambodia for thre years until Vietnam's invasion ousted it in1978.   Vietnam said it completed pulling its troops out at the end ofSeptember, but guerrillas say many of the soldiers have remained.</TEXT></DOC>
