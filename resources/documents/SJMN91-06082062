Gary Shilling of Springfield, N.J. Rates could drop as much as 2 percentagepoints, he predicts.;    Interest received from municipal bonds, which aredebt issued by state and local governments and public agencies andauthorities, generally is exempt from federal tax. Interest from municipalbonds issued in a resident's state also is exempt from state and local taxes.;   However, interest earned on some municipal bonds issued for industrialdevelopment or &quot;private purposes,&quot; such as parking facilities, may be taxablefor investors subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.;    Financialexperts advise sticking with bonds with high-quality &quot;A&quot; ratings from Moody'sand Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. In most cases, yields on those bonds are onlyslightly lower than those of poor quality. Some bonds are insured by privatecompanies, which can boost ratings but lower yields by 0.1 to 0.5 percentagepoints.;    Generally speaking, the risk of default is small. It's estimatedthat less than 1 percent of the tax-exempt securities issued since theDepression have defaulted on principal and interest payments.;   Nevertheless, Ed Maurer, vice president of the municipal bond tradingdepartment at First National Bank of Atlanta, advises sticking close to home.;   &quot;That way, you can better track an area's stability, potential for growthand its tax and revenue base,&quot; he said.;    Municipal bonds are not onlysubject to credit risk but interest-rate risk as well, particularly if thebonds aren't held to maturity. Investors selling bonds when rates rise couldsee the value of their bonds decline.;    Because of that, experts say it'sprudent to stick with bonds maturing in 10 years or less.;    Maurer suggestsa &quot;laddered&quot; maturity, or buying bonds that are due each year for 10 years andreinvesting the proceeds in bonds maturing 10 years later.;    But thatstrategy works best for those with at least $100,000 to invest. Municipalbonds usually are issued in denominations of $5,000.;    For those withconsiderably less to invest, municipal bond funds or unit investment trustsare good alternatives, said Sheldon Jacobs of the No-Load Fund Investor,Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Minimum investments generally are $1,000.;   Municipal bond funds provide diversification and professional management, headded.;    Miller, of Carnegie Funds Management, particularly likes theno-load Vanguard Municipal Bond Fund-Insured Long-Term Portfolio(800-662-7447), with a current 30-day average yield of 6.62 percent.;    DavidMurphy, who manages two municipal bond funds at Boston-based FidelityInvestments, recommends funds invested in bonds maturing in 10 years or less,including his own no-load Fidelity Limited Term Municipals (800-544-8888),yielding 6.27 percent.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Cox News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910322  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  535  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 22, 199100082062,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
