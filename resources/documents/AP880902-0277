The agency said it had cut the proposed penalty in half becausethe St. Paul, Minn.-based company voluntarily disclosed theviolations immediately after they occurred.   The agency said it was not disclosing the chemicals in questionand the dates of the violations because 3M was entitled to keepthat information confidential.   Federal law forbids manufacturing, importing and commercial useof chemicals not on EPA's approved list unless the agency is given90 days notice to review the new chemical.   3M has 20 days to answer EPA's charges. In St. Paul, companyspokesman Mark Fenner said he was unable to comment because he hadnot been made aware of the accusations.</TEXT></DOC>
