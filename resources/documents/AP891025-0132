The trade embargo against the nation of 3 million was imposed byPresident Reagan on May 1, 1985. It bars imports from Nicaragua andbans U.S. exports to that country except to support the Contrarebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It alsoprohibits Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the UnitedStates.   In related developments, Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIsaid the United States protested as recently as today to the SovietUnion about continued shipments of East-bloc arms from Nicaragua toleftist rebels in El Salvador.   Baker, briefing reporters on Bush's upcoming trip to Costa Rica,also said the president would not meet with Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel Ortega this weekend during a celebration of a century ofdemocracy in Costa Rica.   ``I doubt that he would refuse to speak if spoken to, but he'snot going to be meeting with him, and not going to be extending anycourtesies,'' said Baker.   He also said Bush was likely to use the gathering in Costa Rica,to be attended by 19 heads of state, to further ``keep up thepressure'' for the ouster of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegafrom power and to talk about the war on drugs.   The secretary said the administration continues to have concernthat in the upcoming Nicaraguan elections, ``the opposition partiesthere will not be given adequate and sufficient access to the mediato make the election free and fair.''   ``Nicaragua clearly continues to ship arms'' to leftist rebelsin El Salvador, Baker said, citing ``the fact that a truck wasstopped here at the Hunduran border a day or so ago that hadEast-bloc arms in it.''   ``It is a major problem that we have called to the attention ofthe Soviet Union, and called to their attention as recently astoday,'' Baker said.   The Soviet Union has denied any role in such arms shipments.   ``We've had an extended dialogue with the Soviet Union about theimportance of using their influence to stop that kind ofactivity,'' Baker added. ``The Soviets told us they are going touse their best efforts to do that.''   Baker said he was willing to give the Soviets the benefit of thedoubt, since Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze hadrecently been in Nicaragua. ``It would appear to me the Nicaraguansare telling them one thing and doing something else,'' he said.   Baker said a prerequisite for such a meeting was for Ortega tofirst meet with ``the Nicaraguan resistance,'' the contras who havebeen supported by both the Reagan and Bush administrations.   ``We think he ought to meet with his own people before he meetswith us,'' Baker said. ``He has continued to refuse to do that.''   Bush, in a six-month report to Congress on the status of theNicaragua embargo, said ``the trade sanctions are an essentialelement of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in Nicaraguaby diplomatic means.''   The Bush administration wants to see Ortega's government votedout of office in the election next Feb. 25, and contends thatelection preparations unfairly benefit the ruling Sandinistas.   ``The policies and actions of the government of Nicaraguacontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to thenational security and foreign policy of the United States,'' Bushsaid.   ``I do not believe that current conditions in Nicaragua justifylifting the trade sanctions,'' he wrote. He added that if Ortegaholds fair elections and implements democratic reforms, as hepromised in a regional agreement with other Central Americanpresidents, ``the emergency that prompted the imposition of thetrade sanctions would largely be resolved.''</TEXT></DOC>
