Whether it is biting or not, itshould be said,'' Su Shaozhi said in a telephone interview. He saidhe has not been officially criticized for the speech, in which healso declared Marxism in China to be in a state of crisis.   Su gave the speech in December at a forum called by the CommunistParty Propaganda Department.   On Dec. 26, before the Propaganda Department barred the speechfrom publication, the World Economic Herald published it. The papersaid Monday that it had not suffered any political repercussions anddenied rumors that its editor, Chen Benli, had been fired.   ``There is a rumor that (Chen) will leave his job, but there hasbeen no official announcement,'' an editor who identified himselfonly as Su said in a telephone interview. Su is a common name and hewas not related to Su Shaozhi.   However, the editor said that ``many scholars have held meetingsto discuss'' the speech, and many people have come to the paper totalk to editors about it. The Herald has a reputation for publishingmore daring views than other state-run newspapers.   Su Shaozhi, 65, was fired in 1987 as head of the Chinese Academyof Social Sciences' Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung Thought ResearchInstitute. He and several other intellectuals were accused of notbeing socialist enough and of being too fond of Western-styledemocracy.   Su was allowed to continue his reseach at the institute and kepthis party membership. But in his speech he criticized treatment ofothers who were stripped of their jobs and party membership in 1987and previously.   ``Since the (People's Republic) was established, we have had 34mass criticisms of natural scientists,'' he said. ``Not one of theattacks has been correct. Science and culture have suffered seriousdamage.'' He said the purges violated constitutional guarantees ofacademic freedom and the scientific spirit.   ``One of the reasons academic freedom has not been achieved issome leaders in theoretical circles call themselves Marxists butactually use simplified, dogmatic and ossified ideas from the '30sand '40s to decide what is right and wrong,'' he wrote.   Asked in the interview who he referred to, Su named Hu Qiaomu andDeng Liqun, elderly conservatives who were forced later in 1987 tostep down from their main party posts.   ``They continue to have influence,'' Su said. But he saiddogmatic interpretation of Marxism, including an emphasis on classstruggle and centralization of authority, began with revolutionaryleader Mao Tse-tung.   Since Mao's death in 1976, the party has acknowledged he mademistakes and dropped his emphasis on class struggle. But itcontinues periodic campaigns against liberalism.   Su favors a freer interpretation of Marxism that would allow forgreater democracy and more private ownership.</TEXT></DOC>
