The study assessed poverty rates under a variety of hypotheticaldefinitions and found the reported 1986 poverty rate of 13.6 percentwould have been 2 percentage points lower using a definition thatexcluded income taxes and payroll taxes but included non-cashgovernment benefits not factored into the current standard.   The study also concluded that without Social Security, nearlyhalf of the elderly would fall below the poverty line. For 1986, thepoverty line was $5,701 for a single person, $5,255 for a single,elderly person, and $11,203 for a family of four.   The study was the first of a series of experimental reportscompiling benefit and tax data that previously had been handled inseparate reports.   It also was the first time the Census Bureau had estimatedmonetary values to recipients of non-cash benefits such as Medicareand Medicaid.   The government's current definition of income includes all cashpre-tax income except capital gains, including government benefitssuch as Social Security, veterans' benefits, unemployment andworkers' compensation insurance and public assistance.   Some liberal groups have protested the use of pre-tax income fordetermining the poverty level, saying it failed to take into accountwhat the individuals had left over after paying taxes.   Conservatives, on the other hand, argued that non-cash benefits _such as Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, school-lunch and rentsubsidies _ should be included as income when determining thepoverty level, because these programs enhance the quality of therecipients' lives.   Using the current definition, the overall national poverty ratein 1986 was 13.6 percent. Among whites it was 11 percent, amongblacks 31.1 percent and among Hispanics 27.3 percent.   If the definition were amended to include non-cash benefits andcapital gains, the overall poverty rate in 1986 would have been 11.6percent, the Census Bureau reported. Among whites it would have been9.4 percent, among blacks 25.8 percent and among Hispanics 23.5percent.   The new study listed hypothetical poverty rates under a varietyof possible income definitions, including one used in the privatesector: income excluding cash-paid government benefits such asSocial Security while adding employer-provided health benefits.   Comparing the poverty rate among the elderly using the currentgovernment standard and the private-sector formula shows thestriking effect of Social Security.   Using the government formula, 12.4 percent of those over 65 yearsold lived in poverty in 1986. Under the private-sector definitionthat excludes Social Security, the poverty rate for that age groupwas 48.5 percent.   In addition to assessing the effect of various governmentprograms and definitions of income on poverty, the study listed anindex of income concentration under each experimental definition.   Under the official definition of income, the Census Bureaureported that aggregate household income in 1986 was $2.75 trillion,with a median household income of $24,897. The index of incomeconcentration showed that the bottom 20 percent of householdsreceived 3.8 percent of total income while the top 20 percentreceived 46.1 percent.   If all government benefits were subtracted from the incomedefinition and employer-paid health benefits were included, 52.4percent of all income was received by the top 20 percent ofhouseholds and just 1 percent by the bottom 20 percent.   The effect of taxes on poverty varied depending on the type ofhousehold, the study said.   Among married-couple families, for example, subtracting taxesfrom the current income definition increased the poverty rate from9.4 percent to 10.6 percent among whites, from 15.8 percent to 18.5percent among blacks and from 23.8 percent to 26.6 percent amongHispanics.   In single-parent, female-headed households, subtracting taxesincreased the poverty rate among whites from 47.4 percent to 49.9percent. For blacks, it increased from 64.7 percent to 67.9 percentand for Hispanics, the rate increased from 65 percent to 68.5percent.   Income definitions that included all government benefits, on theother hand, produced sizeable reductions in the poverty ratesalthough some groups still were characterized by high rates.   For example, the poverty rate in single-parent, female-headedhouseholds dropped from 49.9 percent to 34.2 percent among whiteswhen government benefits were counted in the income definition.Among such households headed by blacks, the rate dropped from 67.9percent to 49.7 percent; by Hispanics from 68.5 percent to 47.7percent.</TEXT></DOC>
