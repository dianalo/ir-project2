(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The stepchildren who kept the fate of AndreiD. Sakharov known to the world during his years of internal exile inthe Soviet Union are scrambling to prepare for his first visit tothe West.   Sakharov is expected to arrive in Boston on Sunday for a two-weektrip to receive medical treatment, meet a granddaughter born hereand promote the International Foundation for the Survival andDevelopment of Humanity.   The 67-year-old Nobel laureate is a member of the board ofdirectors of the foundation, formed in January by Soviet andAmerican scientists and educators to foster arms control,environmental protection, international development and human rights.   Sakharov is expected to travel without his wife, Yelena Bonner.But he will start the trip by visiting two of her children who livein Boston suburbs.   ``We have started to prepare food for him, but we don't knowexactly what he'll want,'' Mrs. Bonner's son-in-law, EfremYankelevich, said Thursday. ``There's a lot to be done, especiallypreparing his schedule.''   Yankelevich said Sakharov will go to Massachusetts GeneralHospital for a cardiological examination and possible implantationof a heart pacemaker, a procedure that usually requires a two-dayhospital stay.   From Boston, he plans to travel to New York and Washington, butthe dates of his visits to those cities remain uncertain, relativessaid.   Yankelevich said Sakharov hopes to be in Washington on Nov. 15,when the Soviet physicist is expected to receive the $50,000 AlbertEinstein Foundation Peace Prize for 1988.   But the personal highlight of the trip, Yankelevich said,probably will be Sakharov's first meeting with Alexandra Semyonova,the 4-year-old daughter of stepson Alexei Semyonov and his wife,Elizaveta Alekseyeva.   Sakharov went on hunger strikes to win permission from Sovietauthorities for his wife to come to the United States for medicalcare and for Miss Alekseyeva to come here to marry Semyonov.   For his defense of human rights in the Soviet Union, Sakharovreceived the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. Five years later, in January1980, he was banished to Gorky, a city closed to Westerners.   His wife also was banished there in August 1984. Both werereleased in December 1986 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.   Sakharov is expected to be accompanied during part of his visitby Yevgenii Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy ofSciences, and Roald Sagdeev, director of the Soviet Space ResearchInstitute.   Velikhov is chairman of the International Foundation for theSurvival and Development of Humanity, which is headquartered inMoscow and has offices in Washington and Stockholm, Sweden. Sagdeevis a foundation director.   The foundation is about to embark on a worldwide fund-raisingdrive with a goal of about $10 million for the first year, said itsAmerican vice chairman, Jerome Wiesner, president emeritus of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.   Wiesner said the foundation's purpose is to support research on``what I call the modern diseases of the world _ generated bytechnology, population growth, nuclear weapons and so on _ thatrequire cooperation by a number of countries in order to dosomething about them.''   The foundation's first board of directors meeting outside of theSoviet Union is scheduled for Nov. 13-17 in Washington. Sakharov isexpected to attend at least part of the five-day session.   Other American board members include Armand Hammer, chairman ofOccidental Petroleum; the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritusof the University of Notre Dame; Robert S. McNamara, a former U.S.secretary of defense; and John Sculley, chief executive officer ofApple Computer Inc.   Gina Cella Harty, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said it isthe first non-profit, non-governmental international organization tooperate with full legal status in the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
