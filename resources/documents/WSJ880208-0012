The announcement, which may come as early as today, would be the first public step by the department since it created a much-publicized special bank-fraud task force last year to investigate potential wrongdoing at two dozen high-flying Texas banks and thrifts. The investigation involves loans and land deals among about 400 Sandamp;L owners, managers, borrowers and real-estate developers.    The 40-member federal task force is looking into, among other things, violations of federal banking laws including conspiracy to violate banking laws and filing false financial statements. The probe also covers phony sales of undeveloped land several times in a day involving a series of Sandamp;Ls and their customers to inflate land prices and thrift profits.    It is thought that federal prosecutors have obtained arrangements with a handful of less prominent individuals under investigation who will plead guilty to lesser felony counts. In return, these individuals will agree to give information to the task force about some of the most prominent targets in the probe. Two federal grand juries here are hearing testimony.    A top Justice Department official said the announcement would be &quot;a major step in our efforts&quot; in Dallas and involves &quot;a number of significant people.&quot;    &quot;There are a number of people out there who are exposed to criminal prosecution,&quot; said Marvin Collins, the U.S. Attorney here. &quot;Some are more realistic and came in early to cut their losses.&quot;    He added that these agreements usually involve cooperation with federal efforts to prosecute others. Mr. Collins declined to identify the individuals or describe their pleas. No one would name the financial institutions involved. </TEXT></DOC>
