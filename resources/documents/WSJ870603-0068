The campaign -- polling day is June 11 -- had been moving along smoothly and relatively uneventfully until President Reagan told interviewers in Washington that the Labor Party's non-nuclear defense policies add up to &quot;grievous errors.&quot; That did it.    &quot;Reagan Attack on Labour Defence Plans,&quot; shouted the Daily Telegraph's main headline. &quot;President Reagan gate-crashed the election last night,&quot; said the lead front-page paragraph in the Daily Express. Left-wing and right-wing politicians joined in denouncing American &quot;interference&quot; in British affairs.    The &quot;American factor&quot; had been ticking away all along, just waiting to explode. The three big parties -- the Conservatives, Labor, and the Alliance of the Liberals and Social Democrats -- all argue over Britain's independent nuclear deterrent and the future of the U.S. bases here. Labor, which is pledged to a nuclear-disarmament policy that includes closing the U.S. bases, accuses Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of being too close to President Reagan. Moderates in Mrs. Thatcher's own party worry about giant American corporations swallowing British companies. Scholars deplore the &quot;brain drain&quot; of their best and brightest to American universities.    And ordinary Britons still grumble that after American jets bombed Libya, American tourists stayed home for fear of being attacked by revenge-seeking terrorists in London hotels and Cotswolds bed-and-breakfasts. They resented what they viewed as cowardice by some Americans. They still do, in vast numbers.    How, then, stands the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Britain and its former colony?    To find out, The Wall Street Journal joined with Market andamp; Opinion Research International Ltd. to conduct what turned out to be lively discussions with British voters in Shepperton, a comfortable, middle-class town in Surrey, west of London, and in Cambridge, the intellectual, high-tech university town, north of London. The conclusions expressed by these voters tally neatly with the bare-bone statistics in public-opinion polls on the subject.    And the conclusions?    That the &quot;special relationship&quot; is especially touchy these days, perhaps pricklier than ever, with Britons almost universally appalled by President Reagan and uncertain about America's ability to govern itself or reach a sensible accommodation with the Soviet Union. They worry that America has become superpatriotic under Mr. Reagan and paranoid about Soviet ambitions. One out of three Britons, the polls show, sees the U.S. and Soviet Union as equal threats to world peace.    And as for the general run of Americans, Britons see them as brash, noisy, childlike and prone to wander confusedly along London streets in gaudy checked trousers -- their traditional view of Americans. About the best these Britons can say about Americans is that they are friendly and that America is a more open society than Britain, generally free of class and economic barriers.    Even so, says Robin Speed, a computer programmer in Cambridge, Britons &quot;pride themselves in not being like Americans.&quot;    &quot;The only good thing to come out of America is Doris Day,&quot; comments Terry McDermot, the production manager at an engineering firm near Shepperton. He appears to be serious.    To all but one or two of the 32 Britons joining in the discussions, President Reagan is the great American enigma.    &quot;I find it quite astonishing that a B-grade actor could become president,&quot; says Paul Brown, a Cambridge postgraduate researcher. &quot;I don't think people like Reagan should be considered for that job,&quot; says Rose Gill, a Shepperton housewife. &quot;It could never happen here.&quot; &quot;He comes across as a dimwit,&quot; says Isabel Hooper, a Hertz agent at Heathrow airport.    Even those Britons who participated in the four discussion groups and may not be planning to vote for Mrs. Thatcher admire the way they think she handles President Reagan. &quot;She talks down to Reagan a lot,&quot; says John Rooke, a Shepperton schoolteacher. &quot;She pats him on the head,&quot; says Patricia Buffin, an executive secretary from Shepperton.    They worry that Mr. Reagan may not be able to hold his own in disarmament discussions with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev. And, asked which of the two they trust more, they say the Russian.    &quot;Most people would go for Gorbachev,&quot; says Joan Illston of Shepperton. &quot;Gorbachev is a particularly skilled politician,&quot; says Craig Gold, a bank clerk. &quot;Gorbachev could eat Reagan for breakfast,&quot; Miss Hooper says.    Given their distrust of Mr. Reagan and their suspicion that America itself has moved to the right, many Britons worry about the American nuclear arsenal based on British soil.    &quot;I think {Americans} have a hysterical hatred of communism,&quot; says a Cambridge supermarket designer who asked that his name not be used. &quot;I think it is appalling.&quot;    &quot;They have got their missiles in this country, but we haven't got any in theirs,&quot; Mrs. Gill says. &quot;They can set them off here, and we get blown up.&quot;    &quot;We really don't know whether the Americans could push the button or whether they would have to refer to the British government,&quot; Mrs. Buffin says. &quot;That is one thing that worries me -- that they could be a bit trigger-happy.&quot;    (Speaking in the House of Commons in 1983, Mrs. Thatcher said the British-American agreement had been &quot;jointly revised&quot; in view of the opening of U.S. cruise-missile bases here. She said no nuclear weapon &quot;would be fired or launched from British territory without the agreement of the British prime minister.&quot;)    Many of these British voters still think about the American invasion of little Grenada, a Commonwealth island nation in the Caribbean, and the bombing of Libya by American planes based in Britain.    &quot;They just invaded that little island,&quot; Mrs. Buffin says. &quot;We weren't told about that. They just went bang-bang.&quot;    Americans are &quot;immature,&quot; says Mr. Brown, the Cambridge researcher. &quot;It is like something out of the Wild West. Cowboys shooting up the bad guys.&quot; He believes that the American attack on Libya was &quot;basically terrorism, of a quality no better or no worse than the Libyans.&quot;    Others have mixed feelings.    &quot;I didn't agree with the Libyan bombing,&quot; says Eric Pizzey, a British Airways inspection controller. &quot;But looking back on it now, I think it had to be done.&quot;    &quot;There's no way I'd have tried something like that,&quot; says Eric Clouston, a Cambridge University scientist, &quot;but it did seem to cut back terrorism.&quot;    In the biggest upheaval during Mrs. Thatcher's eight years in office, she lost two cabinet ministers last year over the question of whether an American company or a European consortium should rescue Westland Group PLC, Britain's only helicopter manufacturer. The Americans were chosen.    &quot;In practical terms,&quot; the supermarket designer says, &quot;I think there is more to be gained in a European partnership because of the distance and the accessible market. There is more commonality.&quot;    Adds Mr. Clouston, the scientist: &quot;I think the advantage of a European link is that they {Europeans} tend to be more along the lines of British industry, where there is some kind of loyalty to the area. . . . The impression you get of the Americans is that once they come over here, they just do what they can to employ people and get orders and that sort of thing. The allegiance really is just to make money for their company.&quot;    Many Britons worry that the U.S. doesn't think about them much anymore.    &quot;From the U.S. point of view, what happens in England doesn't really affect Americans,&quot; says a Cambridge scientist who asked that he not be named. &quot;I don't think they would be interested in the election unless the {fascist} National Front or the far left were winning.&quot;    &quot;I don't suppose most ordinary Americans even think about Western Europe,&quot; Mr. McDermot says.    &quot;Except when it affects their business,&quot; chimes in Mr. Pizzey.    Given such feelings, many of these Britons are skeptical that the U.S. would come to Britain's aid if Western Europe came under attack.    &quot;I think they are prepared to sacrifice Western Europe,&quot; says Mr. Gold, the bank clerk. &quot;We will be the launching pad for their missiles,&quot; adds Paul Tinham, a heating and air-conditioning repairman.    The British view of America seems to be drawn from American television shows (&quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot; are popular here), old Hollywood movies, stories told by friends who have visited &quot;the States,&quot; and a clutter of other impressions.    Of course, many Britons -- but less than a third of this sample -- have been to the U.S. The longer the visits, it seems, the more penetrating and sympathetic the view of America (with the possible exception of the Cambridge intellectuals).    But whether they have been there or not, most Britons see America as &quot;big,&quot; &quot;fast,&quot; &quot;materialistic&quot; and &quot;obsessed with money.&quot; &quot;We get our views from the soaps on the telly,&quot; says Richard Peacock, a Surrey policeman. &quot;We think most Americans live in $40 million ranches with swimming pools.&quot;    &quot;My true opinion of the country,&quot; the supermarket designer says, &quot;would be that it is the difference between being the U.S. and being yogurt. Yogurt is a live culture, and I really don't see anything coming out of America that I hold much store by. It is a very negative and insular society.&quot; He hasn't visited the U.S.    &quot;I do admire America,&quot; says Mrs. Buffin, who has visited the U.S., &quot;but the word 'culture' doesn't seem to go with it.&quot;    The only American novelist that Mr. Rooke, the schoolteacher, could name was Harold Robbins.    It is Britain, the group agrees, that has culture and history. &quot;We've got a heritage, and they haven't,&quot; says Charles Hickman, a British Telecom engineer.    But Mrs. Buffin makes a final point, a positive and generous one. &quot;America,&quot; she says, &quot;is freedom. If it wasn't for America, I don't think, quite honestly, there would be any freedom.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
