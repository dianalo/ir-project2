 It is attractive because ittends to magnify profits from investment.andP;  But it can also magnify lossesfrom investment.andM;In a leveraged investment, fixed financing costs increase the effect that achange in gross earnings has on earnings per share.andP;  When times are good, aleveraged investment--either a fixed-interest loan or a preferred-stockagreement--brings in more money than is paid out to lenders.andP;  When times arebad, leverage causes problems because small profits are used up by payingguaranteed returns to lenders.andM;This worksheet and the XY graph it generates illustrate the effects offinancial leverage.andP;  The worksheet calculates the impact of three kinds offinancing--common-stock, preferred-stock, and debt--on any investment.andP;  Youcan compare the results on a graph that plots earnings before interest andtaxes (EBIT) against earnings per share (EPS).andM;If you're not familiar with the concept of financial leverage, read &quot;HowFinancial Leverage Works&quot; on page 66.andP;  If you are familiar with financialleverage, build the worksheet and graph by following the instructions on theopposite page.andP;  Then use the balance of this articles as a guide to enteringdata, understanding the calculations, and interpreting graphic output.andM;MODEL INPUTandM;To adapt the worksheet in figure 1 to your own investment needs, follow theseguidelines for entering data:andM;Range C.4..C8: In these cells enter values representing a rance of estimatesof earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).andP;  The worksheet accepts fiveestimates.andP;  When you make these entries, use estimates that cover a range ofpossibilities, from low to high.andP;  In the example, the EBIT estimates areevenly spaced at $150,000 intervals.andP;  However, you do not need to use evenintervals.andP;  When 1-2-3 and Symphony plot the graph, they automatically scalethe graph's X axis to whatever EBIT values you enter.andM;Cell C9: Required funding, which is entered in this cell, is the amount ofmoney you need to raise.andP;  You can raise money from common stock, preferredstock, or debt.andP;  The common-stock alternative lets you test profits with noleverage.andP;  Preferred-stock funding and debt are leverage tools.andM;Cell C10: The common-share price in cell C10 is where you enter the price pershare at which new shares of common stock will be sold.andP;  For  soleproprietorship or for a partnership, use $1 as the common-share price.andP;  Ifyou're exploring financial leverage for a sole proprietorship, you do notneed to enter anything in cells C11..C13.andP;  If you're exploring financialleverage for a partnership, use the preferred-stock category to entercontributions made by partners who receive a preferential return on theirinvestment.andP;  The worksheet treats a partnership as if it were apreferred-stock agreement.andM;Cell C11: The preferred-dividend rate in this cell is the annual return towhich preferred investors are entitled.andP;  For example, if an investor gets an8% preferred return on his investment, enter .08.andM;Cells C12 and C13: Sometimes a preferred investor receives an additionalreturn called a kicker.andP;  This return is usually calculated as the percent ofEBIT over a base amount.andP;  In this case, enter the base amount in cell C12,and enter the percent as the preferred-stock kicker rate in cell C13.andP;  Forexample, suppose that a preferred investor receives 10% of the amount bywhich EBIT exceeds $100,000.andP;  In that case, enter 100000 in cell C12 and .1in cell C13.andM;Cell C14:  The debt-interest rate is the annual interest rate that you pay onthe loan if you borrow the money.andP;  In the example, this rate is 9%.andM;Cells C15 and C16:  Debt agreements can also have kickers.andP;  When this is thecase, the lender receives a percentage of the excess profits.andP;  For example,if a lender would receive 50% of the amount by which EBIT exceeded $300,000,you would enter 300000 in cell C15 and .5 in cell C16.andM;Cell C17:  To calculate taxes, you must enter a marginal-income tax rate.andP;  Inthe example, the marginal-income tax rate in cell C17 is 34%.andM;Cell C18:  You enter in the cell C18 the number of shares of stockoutstanding before receiving financing.andP;  In the example that number is50,000.andP;  For a sole proprietorship or for a partnership, enter the dollarvalue of the sole proprietor's or the partners' investments prior to seekingthe required financing.andP;  More on this in a minute.andM;UNDERSTANDING THE FORMULASandM;The model calculate EPS, or the earnings per dollar of investment in apartnership or sole proprietorship, over a range of profits.andM;The first financing method, common stock, provides no leverage.andP;  Common-stockcalculations are in range B24..F29.andP;  The remaining profits for common-stockholders are calculated by subtracting income taxes from EBIT.andP;  Income taxesare calculated by multiplying the marginal-income tax rate in cell C17 by therange of EBIT values in row 24.andP;  To calculate EPS, the model divides theremaining profits listed in row 27 by the total number of common shares thatwill be outstanding after financing.andM;The model calculates the total number of shares by adding the number of newshares to the current number of shares.andP;  It calculates the number of newshares by dividing the required amount of financing, in cell C9, by the priceof a common share, in cell C10.andM;The next set of calculations, in range B35..F42, is for preferred-stockfinancing.andP;  Here's how they work.andM;First, income taxes are calculated by multiplying the marginal-income taxrate in cell C17 by the EBIT amounts.andP;  Next, the preferred dividend iscalculated by multiplying the required amount of financing, in cell C9, bythe dividend rate of the preferred stock, in cell C11.andP;  The model assumesthat the preferred dividend is paid, or at least is accrued, regardless ofthe EBIT.andM;The preferred-dividend kicker is calculated by multiplying thepreferred-stock kicker rate in cell C13 by any excess in EBIT over thepreferred-kicker base.andP;  The excess is calculated by an @MAX formula.andP;  Itreturns either the value of EBIT minus the preferred-kicker base or zero,whichever is greater.andM;The remaining profits in row 40 are calculated by subtracting the incometaxes, the preferred dividend, and the preferred kicker from EBIT.andP;  Tocalculate EPS, the model divides the remaining profits in row 40 by the totalnumber of common shares in cell C18.andP;  Because no new common shares are issuedin preferred-stock financing, the total number of common shares hasn'tchanged.andM;The calculations for debt financing in range B48..F57 are similar to thecalculations for preferred-stock financing.andP;  The interest on new debt iscalculated by multiplying the required amout of financing, in cell C9, by theinterest rate on the debt, in cell C14.andP;  The debt-interest kicker iscalculated by multiplying the debt-kicker rate in cell C16 by any excess ofEBIT over the debt-kicker base.andM;An @MAX formula returns either EBIT minus the debt-kicker base or zero,whichever is larger.andP;  The pretax income is calculated by subtracting the newinterest and interest kicker amount from the EBIT.andM;Income taxes are calculated by multiplying the tax rate for marginal incomein cell C17 by the pretax incomes in row 52.andP;  The model gets the remainingprofits in row 55 by adding the pretax incomes in row 52 to the income taxesin row 53.andM;To calculate EPS for the debt-financing model, formulas divide the remainingprofits in row 55 by the total number of common shares in cell C18.andM;INTERPRETING THE GRAPHandM;The graph in figure 2 provides insights into the effects of financialleverage.andP;  The three plotted lines show the effect on earnings per share ofthree financing methods over a range of EBIT values.andP;  The top line representsthe most profitable financing method at a given level of EBIT.andM;In the example, common stock provides the most profitable financing methodwhen EBIT is zero to almost $200,000.andP;  When EBIT is between $200,000 and$500,000, debt financing produces the greatest profitability.andP;  Above$500,000, preferred-stock financing proves the most profitable.andP;  At theintersection of lines, the profit levels of two financing methods are equal.andM;The vertical distance between plotted lines indicates the effect of aleveraging method on EPS.andP;  For example, at an EBIT level of $150,000,financing with preferred stock instead of common stock decreases the EPS byalmost $1.andP;  This is an example of negative financial leverage produced bypreferred stock.andM;At an EBIT level of $300,000, however, preferred stock and common stockproduce the same EPS.andP;  This is neutral financial leverage.andP;  Note that at the$300,000 level debt financing increases EPS by almost $1.andM;The slope of each line indicates how sensitive EPS is to changes in EBIT.andO;The steeper the slope, the greater the sensitivity.andM;This is illustrated by the slope of the preferred stock and debt lines fromEBIT amounts of $300,000 to $600,000.andP;  Over this range, a given change inEBIT results in a greater change in EPS in preferred-stock financing than indebt financing.andM;Financial leverage is a two-edged sword.andP;  It can magnify profits but it canalso increase losses.andP;  This worksheet and graph can help you examine theimpact of financial leverage as a financing method.andP;  As you examine variousfinancing situations, remember that investment performance is crucial to thesuccessful application of any leveraging strategy.andM;Stephen L.
