Activists in Bir Zeit said they would observe the anniversary byreading the Palestinian independence proclamation over a mosqueloudspeaker and marching military-style under the Palestinianflags, which Israel has outlawed.   The army closed schools in the Gaza Strip, arrested allegedagitators in West Bank raids and called in reinforcements to helpquell anticipated riots.   Soldiers sealed off the Gaza Strip, searching for Palestiniangunmen who killed an Israeli soldier Monday evening and woundedanother. The Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas, or Zeal, claimedresponsibility for the attack.   Late Tuesday, a Palestinian was shot by soldiers and later diedfrom a chest wound at Ramallah Hospital in the West Bank, doctorssaid. The body was snatched from the hospital, apparently byrelatives, they said.   Israel radio identified the Palestinian as Odah Hussein Ziyad,18, from the Kalandia refugee camp five miles north of Jerusalem.The army confirmed the death but said it was checking to see ifsoldiers were involved.   Also in the West Bank, Manweh Bakry, 45, of Nablus, died ofchest wounds suffered in a Sept. 14 clash with troops. The deathsraised to 615 the number of Palestinians killed by soldiers orcivilians in the 23-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.Forty-one Israelis have also died in the violence.   At least 16 Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing clasheswith Israeli troops throughout the West Bank and Gaza StripTuesday, Arab sources said.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the attack on the soldierscould signal plans to increase the use of guns and explosives. ThePalestine Liberation Organization has urged its followersrepeatedly not to use firearms, recommending non-violent protestand civil disobedience instead.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir began a visit to the UnitedStates, where he will meet with President Bush on proposals forpeace talks with Palestinians.   Palestinian flags of black, white, green and red hung fromtelephone poles and power lines throughout the West Bank and Gaza,which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle EastWar. Pictures of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat were pasted onbuildings.   Children in Gaza City handed out flowers and balloons in theflag colors. Arab motorists honked their horns and flicked onlights as they drove down Omar Al Mukhtar Street, the mainthroroughfare, witnesses reported.   Firework rockets streaked across the sky in the early evening,leaving red and blue trails.   Rabin warned Palestinians against taking part in thefestivities, declaring on army radio: ``Be it the unfurling of aflag, or the throwing of a stone or illegal gatherings, all stepswill be taken against these things.''   In Bir Zeit, a town of 3,000 people, flags and pictures adornedlamp posts, telephone poles and even the top of a cross on theRoman Catholic Church, Our Lady of Guadeloupe.   Yusef, a 26-year-old activist who would not give his last name,said women's committes planned to dance the ``dabka,'' atraditional Palestinian folk dance, in the streets on theanniversary of the independence declaration Nov. 15, 1988, at ameeting of the Palestinian Nationl Council in Algiers.   Students from Bir Zeit University, which the army closed earlyin the uprising, posted an invitation in a coffee shop to a``Photography exhibit on the Palestinian state.''   ``Despite the pain of so many dead and wounded, this is a momentof joy,'' said Mahdi Abdel Hadi, a Palestinian leader in Jerusalem.``It shows that we can change and lead our own history.''   ``How can I celebrate with so many people killed and wounded?''said a gasoline station attendant, who would not give his name.``People will try to celebrate, but I think the army will suppressthem.''   In the West Bank security sweep, soldiers detained 58Palestinians suspected of uprising activities, Arab reporters said.   On Monday evening, Palestinians fired 28 shots at an Israelipatrol jeep, killing Cpl. Sarul Trechtenboit, 42, and criticallywounding another soldier, an army spokesman reported.   Trechtenboit, who leaves four children, was the first soldierkilled in Gaza since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Eightsoldiers are among the 41 Israeli victims of the violence.   Israel radio said an anonymous caller claimed responsibility forthe attack in the name of Hamas, which opposes the PLO policy ofseeking a negotiated settlement with Israel. Hamas also has beenblamed for the kidnap-murder of two soldiers who disappeared whilehitchhiking earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
