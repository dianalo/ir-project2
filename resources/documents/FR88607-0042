Customshas been allowing a method of marking known as ``major supplier marking''for containers of orange juice since February 1, 1987. Marking requirements,and the applicability of major supplier marking, are being extended toother fruit juices as of June 7, 1989, by another Customs document publishedin today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Major supplier marking stipulates that if aprocessor obtains 75 percent or more of its imported concentrate from onesource country, only that source country need be disclosed. Otherwise,if no single source accounts for 75 percent or more of the concentrate,than all source countries must be disclosed.Customs has been asked to consider whether major supplier marking providesthe level of information to consumers that was contemplated by the countryof origin marking laws, as codified in the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.Because of comments submitted in response to a prior <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice addressing the marking of apple juiceand other fruit juices made from concentrate, and because of concerns thathave been raised regarding public health, Customs has declined to considerfurther the merits of major supplier marking. The comments submitted indicatedthat major supplier marking may not provide adequate information to consumersof imported apple juice because of the wide variety of sources and thefrequency of the changes in those sources. The public health concern alsoraises potential issues regarding major supplier marking of fruit juices.Customs has been told that certain pesticides, banned in the U.S. becausethey can cause illness, may be reaching the U.S. because the pesticideswere used on foreign fruit which is the source of imported concentrates.If major supplier marking for fruit juice concentrate were not allowed,and all countries of origin of fruit juice concentrate are listed on juicecontainers, it is alleged that the Food and Drug Administration would bebetter able to trace imported concentrate that may contain pesticides,and that consmers could better protect themselves from potential healththreats.Accordingly, Customs is now proposing that all fruits made from foreignconcentrate be required to be labeled to indicate all actual sources ofconcentrate contained in the particular package of juice. If the proposedrule is adopted, all fruit juice concentrate processors, including processorsof orange juice, will no longer be allowed to use major supplier marking.Written comments are invited on this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before August 8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments (preferably in triplicate) should be submittedto and may be inspected at the Regulations and Disclosure Branch, Room2324, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC20229.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>John Doyle, Office of Regulationsandamp; Rulings, (202-566-5765).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2> <ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In a ruling dated September 4, 1985 (C.S.D. 85-47, 19 Cust. Bull. No. 39at 21), the Customs Service held that containers of orange juice in frozenconcentrated or reconstituted forms which contain foreign concentrate mustbe labeled to comply with the country of origin marking requirements ofsection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304). The rulingwas based on the determination that the foreign concentrate which is importedinto the U.S. and used in the production of frozen concentrated or reconstitutedorange juice is not substantially transformed after undergoing furtherprocessing in the U.S. involving blending with other batches of orangeconcentrate; addition of water, oils, and essences; pasteurization or freezing;and repacking. In <T3>National Juice Products Association</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> CIT Slip Op. 86-13 (Jan. 30, 1986), the Court ofInternational Trade held that C.S.D. 85-47 was substantially valid.  On March 19, 1986, Customs held in Ruling No. 729410 (C.S.D. 86-19, 20Cust. Bull. No. 33 at 17) that orange juice containers would meet the markingrequirements if only the major foreign sources of the imported productwere listed (``major supplier marking''). Under current practice, majorsupplier marking permits an orange juice processor that obtains 75 percentor more of its imported concentrate from one country to disclose only thatsource. If there is no one source country supplying 75 percent or moreof the imported concentrate, all foreign countries from which the concentrateis derived must be disclosed.  Noting that orange juice imports are principally from a single countryand that sources of supply remain constant, Customs permitted major suppliermarking of orange juice based on the conclusion that in most cases suchmarking would be both accurate and informative. Customs believed that inthese circumstances major supplier marking would serve the statutory requirementthat the ultimate purchaser be informed of the country of origin, notwithstandingthat the origin of a minority portion of the concentrate might not be disclosed.Customs also believed that this approach would facilitate compliance withthe marking statute by eliminating the need to identify and disclose thenames of those countries that supply a very small quantity of orange juiceconcentrate.On June 25, 1986, Customs published T.D. 86-120 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 23045), informing the public that frozenconcentrated and reconstituted orange juice products containing importedconcentrate were required to bear lables marked for country of origin byFebruary 1, 1987. The notice of the decision announced that Customs hadconsidered the comments submitted in response to an earlier notice, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 3, 1986 (51 FR 7285), and that requiringcountry of origin marking for these products was consistent with the courtdecision in <T3>National Juice Products.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Other Fruit Juices</ITAG>On July 30, 1986, Customs announced in a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice (51 FR 27195) that the principles setforth in C.S.D. 85-47 and supported by the court in <T3>National Juice Products</T3> were to be applicable to containers ofother fruit juices containing imported concentrate as well as to thoseof orange juice. In other words, imported fruit juice concentrate whichis imported into the U.S. and used in the production of reconstituted fruitjuice is not substantially transformed after undergoing further processingin the U.S. involving blending with other batches of concentrate, additionof water, oils and essences, pasteurization or freezing, and repacking.Accordingly, pursuant to the notice, all frozen concentrated or reconstitutedfruit juices made from imported concentrate and so processed will be requiredto be marked to indicate the country of origin. In addition, the noticeannounced that the certification requirements set forth in andSection;134.25,Customs Regulations (19 CFR 134.25), would be applicable. The notice soughtpublic comments for the purpose of establishing an effective date. Another document, published in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> discusses the comments that were received concerningthe establishment of an effective date and sets forth the effective date.Because major supplier marking has been allowed for imported orange juiceproducts, and because processors of other juices reasonably may have expectedthat major supplier marking would apply to them as well, Customs, for reasonsof fairness, states in that document that the juice processors may meetthe marking requirements by using major supplier marking. However, whilemajor supplier marking has been approved for the time being, Customs hasbeen urged by comments received in response to the July 30, 1986, noticeto question whether major supplier marking adequately meets the requirementsof the marking statute.<ITAG tagnum="84">Major Supplier Marking</ITAG>Many of the comments received in response to the July 30, 1986 notice discussedthe feasibility of major supplier marking for fruit juices, other thanorange juice, made from imported concentrate. Most of the comments concernedthe apple juice. These comments stated that apple juice concentrate isimported in large quantities from many countries, that the relative quantitiesimported from these countries vary greatly from year to year and seasonto season, and that processing in the U.S. often requires that apple juicefrom a variety of sources be blended to achieve desired characteristics.Because of these factors, many commenters on behalf of the domestic appleindustry stated that marking that lists the name of a single country thataccounts for the origin of 75 percent of a product and does not list allcountries from which the product in a particular container is derived ismeaningless. On the other hand, because of the same factors, many commenterson behalf of the processors of apple juice concentrate claimed that majorsupplier marking is as informative for apple juice concentrate as it isfor orange juice concentrate, and that it would be economically prohibitiveto require containers of apple juice concentrate to be marked to indicateall sources of concentrate or juice within a container.The U.S House of Representatives Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigationsof the Committee on Energy and Commerce has urged Customs to adopt specificcountry of origin marking of fruit juice containers for public health reasons.The subcommittee has told Customs that a number of pesticides banned inthe U.S. are routinely applied to crops overseas, particularly in developingcountries. The subcommittee pointed out that listing of all countries oforigin of juice concentrate on juice containers would facilitate bettermonitoring and tracing of imported juice and juice concentrate and wouldallow consumers to protect themselves from potential health threats. <ITAG tagnum="84">Uniformity of Marking for all Fruit Juices </ITAG>Although many of the comments received by Customs address the adequacyof major supplier marking with respect to apple juice products, the samequestion clearly applies to other juice products as well; that is, whetherthe origin disclosure made by major supplier marking satisfies the requirementsof the law. Moreover, the public health concerns raised with respect toapply juice are equally applicable to other fruit juices. Accordingly, Customs proposes to require that all fruit juices made fromforeign concentrate, including orange juice, be labeled to indicate allactual sources of concentrate contained in a particular package of juice.For example, if a can of juice contains a blend of concentrate from threeforeign countries, all three countries must be indicated on the label.This proposal encompasses all fruit juice concentrate which undergoes processingin the U.S. similar to the processing described in C.S.D. 85-47; <T3>i.e., </T3>blending with other batches of concentrate; addition ofwater, oils, and essences; pasteurization or freezing; and repacking. Ifthe proposed rule is adopted, processors of apple juice and other fruitjuices, including those of orange juice, that use imported concentratewould no longer be allowed to use major supplier marking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>All public comments submitted on this issue will be considered before afinal determination is reached regarding the method of marking that willbe required for fruit juices. Customs will consider any written commentstimely submitted.
