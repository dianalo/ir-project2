The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessmentof the proposed action ``Environmental Assessment by the Office of NuclearReactor Regulation Relating to the Expansion of the Spent Fuel Pool, FacilityOperating License No. NPF-57, Public Service Electric and Gas Company,Hope Creek Generating Station, Docket No. 50-354,'' dated June 5, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Environmental Assessment</ITAG>The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handlingand Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel'' (NUREG-0575), Volumes1-3 (1979), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storageof spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflectsthe advantage of continued generation of nuclear power with the accompanyingspent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommendedevaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis.For Hope Creek Generating Station, the expansion of the storage capacityof the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiologicaleffects or non-radiological environmental impacts beyond those assessedin the Commission's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in December1984 related to the operation of Hope Creek Generating Station, and inthe Safety Evaluation Report issued October 1984 in support of a licenseamendment concerning storage capacity.The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expandedspent fuel pool is estimated to be less than one percent of the total annualoccupational radiation exposure for this facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facilityrelative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based on thisassessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiologicalor non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action and thatthe issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significantimpact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared forthis action.For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applicationfor amendment dated October 26, 1988, (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storageof Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575), (3) the FES for HopeCreek Generating Station dated December 1984, and (4) the EnvironmentalAssessment dated June 5, 1989.These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at thePennsville Public Library, 190 S.
