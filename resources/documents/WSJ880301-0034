Dandamp;N said it is dropping its suit against Seligman andamp; Associates, a Southfield, Mich., group led by Irving R. Seligman and Scott J. Seligman. In return, the Seligmans agreed they won't increase their Dandamp;N holdings to more than 10% before Feb. 21, 1990. They also agreed not to raise their stake beyond 15% between Feb. 21, 1990, and Feb. 21, 1991, provided Dandamp;N stock trades at or below $17.50 a share during that year, Dandamp;N said. Dandamp;N shares closed yesterday at $8.625, up 25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.    The group also agreed to vote its stock in line with the majority of other stockholders, not to solicit proxies, and not to resell 5% or more of their holdings to any one group or individual. Dandamp;N agreed to reimburse the group for legal costs up to the amount Dandamp;N spent on the litigation.    Dandamp;N had charged the Seligman group wanted to take control of the bank, contrary to statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
