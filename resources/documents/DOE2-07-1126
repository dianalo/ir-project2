The contrast agents usedwere loversol 320 (MP328) (30 patients), Iopamidol 370 (30 patients),and 76% meglumine diatrizoate (30 patients). The hemodynamic and electrocardiographiceffects of Ioversol and Iopamidol were virtually identical and significantlydifferent from those of diatrizoate. Changes in LVEDP after left ventriculographywere as follows: Ioversol, 3.8 +- 1.0 mm Hg; Iopamidol, 4.4 +- 1.2 mmHg, and diatrizoate, 9.5 +- 1.5 mm Hg. Maximum QT prolongations aftercoronary arteriography were as follows: Ioversol, 6.6 +- 2.0 msec; Iopamidol,3.2 +- 1.8 msec; and diatrizoate 40 +- 3 msec. Adverse reactions wereas follows: Ioversol, zero; Iopamidol, zero; and diatrizoate, four. Ioversoland Iopamidol are equivalently safe angiographic contrast agents superiorto diatrizoate.</TEXT></DOC>
