The Models A300and A300-600 are similar with respect to this area. This condition, ifnot corrected, could lead to separation of the rear passenger door andsubsequent rapid decompression.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-6024, dated August3, 1987, which describes procedures for the inspection of the rear passenger/crewdoor; and Service Bulletin A300-53-6019, dated September 18, 1987, whichdescribes procedures for modification of the door frame structure. Accomplishmentof the modification terminates the need for the repetitive inspections.The DGAC has classified both service bulletins as mandatory, and has issuedFrench AD 88-061-083(B) addressing this subject.The airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated in theUnited States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the Federal AviationRegulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since these conditions are likely to exist or develop on airplanes of thismodel registered in the United States, an AD is proposed that would requirerepetitive inspections of the rear passenger/cargo door, and modification,if necessary, in accordance with the service bulletins described above.It is estimated that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 9 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD to U.S.operators is estimated to be $1,080.The regulations set forth in this notice would be promulgated pursuantto the authority in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C.1301, <T3>et seq.</T3>), which statute is construed to preempt state law regulatingthe same subject. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it isdetermined that such regulations do not have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this document(1) involves a proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order12291 and (2) is not a significant rule pursuant to the Department of TransportationRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); andit is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of smallentities because of the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($360).A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is containedin the regulatory docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend andSection; 39.13 ofPart 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
