CFTC officials already are being whipsawed by some critics who say the agency and the Chicago Board of Trade should have moved sooner to stave off the squeeze last month in the soybean pit -- and, at the same time, by others who contend they should have let the squeeze play out. &quot;It may prove to be that the cure was worse than the disease,&quot; says Sen. Christopher Bond (R., Mo.) in a letter to CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm.    The CFTC is also under mounting pressure to take enforcement action against Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. for allegedly trying to corner the market. Some major traders are calling the Italian grain merchant a reckless cowboy and warning of further market chaos if Ferruzzi isn't penalized by the CFTC and disciplined by the exchange.    The Ferruzzi affair, coming on the heels of 46 indictments in the government's investigation of fraudulent futures trading in the Chicago markets, has deepened widespread distrust of the CFTC and the futures industry's system of self-regulation.    The credibility of the agency, never known for regulatory ardor, is at stake as never before. And the outcome of the investigation will influence the shape of market-reform legislation, as well as the scope of CFTC's regulatory powers.    &quot;The CFTC has got to deal with this matter, and promptly,&quot; says Commissioner Fowler West. &quot;We have to find a way to discourage people from taking the whole system to the brink.&quot;    Pressure on the agency is particularly intense from Farm Belt lawmakers, many of whose constituents suffered heavy losses after the exchange forced Ferruzzi to sell contracts for the delivery of more than 20 million bushels of soybeans. The big selloff caused a plunge in soybean prices.    &quot;I know who lost -- every farmer in Iowa,&quot; asserts Rep. David Nagle (D., Iowa). &quot;It's important to know who won.&quot;    Ferruzzi is depicting itself as the biggest loser of all in a public relations campaign guided by Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc., and appears to be winning some sympathy. Many foreign traders and soybean producers agree that Ferruzzi's massive holdings were economically justified; the Board of Trade stepped in, they maintain, to protect U.S. traders from defaulting on obligations to deliver to Ferruzzi. The exchange insists it had to act to ensure an orderly market.    Other than jawboning and imposing trading limits on large commercial traders, it isn't clear what power the CFTC has -- or is willing to exercise -- to deter squeezes. For one, the agency has brought only five price-manipulation cases in its 15-year history. Moreover, in a case two years ago the commission adopted such a narrow interpretation of price manipulation that &quot;it's difficult for us to find a manipulation,&quot; says Commissioner West. &quot;Hell, it's virtually impossible.&quot;    This situation isn't likely to sit well with those members of the Senate and House agriculture committees who favor a more aggressive CFTC, nor with major traders who are familiar with Ferruzzi's dealings.    &quot;It was a classic squeeze,&quot; says one trader. &quot;If there's no action, people will get the impression they can . . . get away with it. This goes to the fabric of the regulatory system.&quot;    This trader, who insists on anonymity, blames Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, a Milan-based conglomerate, for what happened in the Chicago soybeans pit. &quot;That Italian has a gigantic view of himself as conqueror of the world,&quot; he asserts. U.S. regulators must bring him in check, he says, adding: &quot;The market relies on firmness, integrity and rationalityand having a cowboy out there is bad news.&quot;    David Swanson, chief executive officer of Ferruzzi-controlled Central Soya Co., which has processing plants in Indiana and Ohio, takes sharp issue with such a characterization of his boss, describing Mr. Gardini as a &quot;dynamic&quot; and &quot;visionary&quot; businessman who &quot;certainly stands large on the international stage.&quot; Mr. Swanson also denies that Ferruzzi sought to corner the market.    &quot;We didn't own one more bean than we needed,&quot; he says.&quot;We simply were trying to hedge the legitimate and bona fide interests of our company.&quot; It would be &quot;ridiculous&quot; for Ferruzzi to attempt squeeze, he adds. &quot;We need the Chicago Board of Trade.&quot;    At a hearing Sept. 8, the Senate Agriculture Committee will ask CFTC officials for their assessment of what happened. &quot;Charges of market manipulation are always serious,&quot; says Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) in a letter to Mrs. Gramm. &quot;If anyone has broken the rules . . . they must be discovered and punished.&quot;    Lawmakers also will demand a full report on the CFTC's response to the so-called emergency in the soybean market. It still isn't clear whether the agency acquiesced to the Board of Trade's liquidation order or forced the exchange's hand in the closing days of the July soybean contract. Some House members are unhappy with Mrs. Gramm, the CFTC chairman, claiming she was initially less than forthcoming about the agency's role.    The most pressing issue facing Congress and the CFTC, however, will be how to prevent another market crisis.    &quot;Whether you call it a squeeze or a corner, you're talking about somebody jerking the market around,&quot; says Mr. West, the CFTC commissioner. &quot;We need to find a way to move earlier.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
