Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House GovernmentOperations Committee, criticized the deletion Thursday anddescribed it as the Bush administration's price for supporting thepay-ethics package.   House members voted 252-174 Thursday to raise their pay by morethan $30,000 a year over the next 13 months _ to above $120,000annually _ while eliminating acceptance of honoraria and limitingother outside income. Federal judges and top executive branchofficials also would get higher pay.   The procurement law, which took effect in July, was largely aresponse to a Defense Department procurement scandal involvingpayoffs and leaks of inside information to contractors andconsultants.   The procurement legislation prohibits contractors from offeringgratuities to federal employees and makes it illegal for governmentofficials to solicit or accept gifts.   The law also prohibits the disclosure of sensitive informationand establishes a two-year period after government employment,during which procurement officials are barred from working on thecontracts they handled.   ``Now, in the middle of the night, the president has exacted therepeal of this provision as the price for much-needed pay reform,''Conyers said. ``We have given the procurement process back to thosecompanies that have brought us Operation Ill Wind (the name givento the Pentagon investigation) and similar scandals.''   The reforms passed by the House includes provisions to curbexcessive free travel, food and lodging on trips sponsored byspecial interest groups.   ``The principal issue ... is the public perception that suchtrips often may amount to paid vacations for the member and hisfamily,'' the bipartisan House ethics task force that wrote thereforms said in a report Thursday.   The House package would end acceptance of honoraria in 1991except when the money is given to charity. But congressionalwatchdogs have long recognized that fully paid trips to aconference at Hilton Head Island, S.C., can be worth more than the$2,000 per speech a lawmaker could earn addressing the gathering.   The package would prohibit acceptance of travel, lodging andfood expenses for more than four consecutive days for trips in thecontinental United States, and seven consecutive days (excludingtravel days) for foreign travel.   The language would allow the House ethics committee to grantwaivers, and permit the member to accept expenses for one relative.There currently are no time limits on such trips.   The ethics package has a broad range of other provisions,including a limit on earned outside income of 15 percent of salarystarting in 1991 and a prohibition on receipt of gifts fromnon-family members of more than $200 a year, beginning Jan. 1, 1990.   The House ethics committee _ formally the Committee on Standardsof Official Conduct _ would divide into separate subcommittees toinvestigate a case and conduct a trial phase. In 1993, the packagewould end a perk that allows House members who were in office in1980 to keep leftover campaign money when they retire. Newcategories of financial disclosure would be established.   These reforms come with strings attached, because Congress wouldreceive annual, automatic cost-of-living increases based on aneconomic index. Also, none of the reforms would take effect unlessthe full pay raise voted Thursday actually goes into effect.   Congress could, if it chooses, repeal some or all of the raisenext year. The bulk of the increase doesn't become effective untilJan. 1, 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
