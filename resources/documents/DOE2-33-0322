In these reactorssolar cells are manufactured on the basis of the so-called Metal OrganicVapour Phase Epitaxy process (MOVPE). The control and monitoring of thisprocess are realized with UNIX and VME-bus. The acquired software hasbeen developed in own account and is written in C. After a short introductionand consideration of the process technique the development of the processautomation is discussed in detail. Two strong MOVPE reactors have beenconstructed with which (fundamental) research can be carried out on improvementof efficiency of (Al)GaAs solar cells and numerous other interestinglayer structures, which can be of importance for (opto)-electronics.8 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
