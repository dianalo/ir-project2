Periodic tests of power systemcomponents can result in improved power system availability and safetyto personnel at reduced cost. However, it is necessary to be aware ofthe available tests and their limitations. This paper presents this informationin light of recent research results, and suggests the use of negative-sequencemonitoring for incipient failure prediction.</TEXT></DOC>
