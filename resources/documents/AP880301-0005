Reagan told the American Legion convention that ``preventing theconsolidation of a pro-Soviet regime on the American mainland is acrucial test of national security.''   On the eve of today's scheduled House Rules Committeeconsideration of a humanitarian aid package, he seemed resigned tothe fact there will be no immediate vote for military aid.   ``Some say they're willing to support some type of humanitarianaid, but are doing everything they can do disband the freedomfighters,'' Reagan said. ``But there's nothing humanitarian aboutasking people to go up against Soviet attack helicopters armed onlywith boots and bandages.''   Reagan used the American Legion address to remind Congress ofhis intentions as he prepared to leave for the summit with NATOpartners in Brussels, Belgium. He is concerned about possibleshowdown votes on Contra aid, first in the Rules Committee andlater in the week on the House floor.   The committee is weighing a $30.5 million Contra aid bill,sponsored by Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., and other Democrats, whichwould provide no military assistance.   A rival Republican bill would be in much the same form as the$36.2 million piece of legislation that Reagan had sought earlierthis year, except there would be no money contained in the bill fora military escrow account.   In an attempt to win enactment of the $36.2 million measure inearly February, Reagan told Congress he would consult with leadinglawmakers before releasing the $3.6 million in an escrow fund formilitary use. The House defeated the bill by eight votes. It waspassed in the Senate, but the vote was only symbolic.   The CIA's authority to carry out airlifts of supplies to therebels expired at midnight. Reagan did not mention this Monday. Buthe did say that ``whatever package emerges from the Congress mustinclude a provision for expedited procedures that would allow us torequest official military aid to the freedom fighters should thepeace process break down.''   Reagan said that since the $36.2 million Contra aid package wasdefeated, the Sandinistas have been ambivalent about promisedreforms, causing Cardinal Obando y Bravo to suspend peace talks hehas been mediating.   ``Unless the freedom fighters remain a viable force, the peaceprocess will remain what it was before _ an empty charade, draggingendlessly and fruitlessly on while the Soviets continue themilitary buildup on the American mainland,'' Reagan said.   Reagan told his audience that if all assistance is stopped, therebels ``will be picked off one by one'' by the leftist Sandinistaregime in Managua.   ``Are we going to cut them off now and leave them defenselessagainst the Sandinistas? If we do, who will ever trust in theUnited States again? How can we remain a world power if we gain areputation for pulling the plug on the people that placed theirtrust in us?''</TEXT></DOC>
