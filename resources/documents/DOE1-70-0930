<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-70-0930 </DOCNO><TEXT>The accelerator program at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) isfocussed on increasing e/sup +/e/sup -/ luminosity in the 10 GeV center-of-massenergy region of the upsilon resonances. We have recently installed ''micro-beta''inserts using permanent magnet quadrupoles, and are using a detailedcomputer simulation of CESR to study luminosity limitations related tothe beam-beam interaction. We have also tested a low emittance latticewhich is compatible with future operation of an undulator x-ray source.Research on superconducting RF cavities at Cornell is aimed at raisingaccelerating fields to a level at which superconducting RF could be anattractive option for TeV energy electron linacs. 11 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
