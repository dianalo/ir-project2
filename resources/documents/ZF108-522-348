(MITi) in Washington, D.C.andM;Readware works not only in English, but also in Spanish, French, Russian,German, Hebrew, Swedish and Arabic.andP;  It enables users to pose questionsregarding a text to their standard IBM or compatible computer in any of theseeight languages (no matter what the language of the text they are referringto).andP;  The queries can be worded in any form -- poor grammar and misspellingsare overlooked.andP;  Readware scans the material at a rate of 1,000 pages persecond and highlights passages in the text relevant to the query.andM;Readware Technologies Inc. (RTI) of Vancouver, has obtained the worldwidemarketing rights to the software.andP;  It is now being used in the U.S.andP;  Libraryof Congress, and the U.S.andP;  Department of Justice.andP;  Readware recently landed amajor contract with the Walter Reed Military Centre, which plans to implementthe Textbook of Military Medicine on CD interactive and use Readware as thesearch engine.andP;  As well, the Centre for Environmental Enterprise in Victoriais using the product for managing its information.andM;Called the Research Assistant, the product consists of a compiler andread-only media.andP;  The compiler processes ASCII text in all languages.andP;  Oncethe text is compiled, users can ask questions about it.andM;Readware plans to tackle the market first by concentrating not on productsales, but on the development of &quot;The Information Factory,&quot; a network ofcentres which will provide services such as scanning, compiling to Readwareformat, document analysis, document handling, assembly services andconsulting.andM;With the growth in service industries, Readware president John Fellows feelsthe service approach is a good place to start.andP;  Other planned marketingmethods include marketing of information packaged under Readware, productlicensing to corporate, government and educational markets, professionalinformation publishers, original equipment manufacturers and verticalsoftware developers.andM;Readware is unlike any other text query tool.andP;  The patented program is basedon the theory Letter Semantics, founded on the principle that every word of anatural language is a combination of alphabetic letters, every single letteris a message in itself and every way of combining letters is a moresophisticated message.andP;  Readware researchers believe there is a relationshipbetween words and the events they describe.andM;Ewell and Adi spent ten years mapping the meaning of letters in the Arabiclanguage, testing their theories on the Koran, the holy scripture of Islam.andM;What the MITi researchers eventually discovered was that words in anylanguage have a similar morphology that can be mapped into a matrix ofmeaning.andP;  &quot;The matrix is the cornerstone of the program.andP;  It defines allsituations those letters could work in,&quot; said Fellows.andM;Semantic matchesandM;The reason Readware can handle multilingual inquiries, says Fellows, is theprogram takes your query and makes &quot;merely semantic matches based on breakingdown the fundamental stems of the query and matching that result with thecompiled text.andP;  It doesn't reorganize information and bring it back to youthe way a database program would.andP;  It doesn't deduce anything; it only givesyou back what's there.&quot;andM;But neither does the program rely on exhaustive databases, inferential logic,programmer rules or strict query protocol.andP;  Given a simple, or even a verycomplex question, the program can be adjusted much like a stereo equalizer,to filter out responses that are not relevant to a user's needs.andM;Better than mostandM;The program can also be used simply for key-word searches and is better thanmost programs of this type since it tolerates error.andP;  The program also flagsreferences that are not exact word matches, but related in meaning.andP;  Thisoften leads to serendipitous discoveries of information.andM;The Information Factory, which will be set up within six months, will providecustom indexing of unstructured files, intelligent achieving and customizedhypertext formatting for navigating large text bases and archives.andM;These services provide a means to quickly navigate a large text baseaccording to specific information needs.andP;  &quot;The program puts everyone on alevel playing field,&quot; said Fellows.andP;  He hopes it will become a widespreadtool for the dissemination of information.andP;  &quot;If the product's potential isrealized, it could be revolutionary.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
