The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposesto establish two new routine uses for DOE-5, ``Personnel Records of FormerContractor Employees;'' DOE-33, ``Personnel Medical Records;'' DOE-35,``Personnel Radiation Exposure Records;'' DOE-43, ``Personnel SecurityClearance Files;'' DOE-71, ``The Radiation Accident Registry;'' DOE-72,``The Department of Energy Radiation Study Registry;'' and DOE-73, ``TheUS-DTPA Registry.'' The first new routine use would permit the disclosureof records maintained in these systems to independent researchers for purposesof conducting epidemiological studies of current and former workers atDOE facilities. Independent researchers who have had their proposals reviewedby the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), and have been certified by NASas appropriate to receive this information, may be granted access to recordsmaintained in these systems. Currently, access to records is permittedonly for health hazards evaluations and epidemiological studies of workersconducted by DOE contractors and other Federal and state agencies. Thisnotice will permit disclosure to independent researchers or records maintainedin these systems that are necessary for epidemiological studies of workersat DOE facilities.The second routine use proposed by the Department for these systems orrecords will permit the disclosure of records maintained in these systemsto members of an advisory committee who will review and evaluate the Department'sepidemiological program.The Department also proposes to delete death certificates from the listingof categories of records maintained in DOE-72, ``The Department of EnergyRadiation Study Registry.'' The Privacy Act only applies to records thatpertain to living individuals. The death certificates, therefore, are notsubject to the Privacy Act and should not be included as part of the systemof records. Moreover, since the death certificates were obtained pursuantto confidentiality agreements with state agencies, the documents are notagency records because they are not under the control of the DOE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received by December 18, 1989.

DOE, therefore, is establshing routine used to provide independentresearchers access to records maintained in these systems for purposesof studying whether there are any health effects from occupational exposureto chemical, radiation, and physical hazards to current and former workersat DOE facilities and to members of any advisory committee appointed toreview and evaluate the conduct of the Department's epidemiological program.The Privacy Act provides that a record may be disclosed, without the priorwritten consent of the individual to whom the record pertains, pursuantto a routine use. A routine use, with respect to disclosure of a record,is a use which is compatible with the purpose for which the record wascollected. It has been determined that the proposed routine uses are compatiblebecause the records are maintained for purposes of either assessing workers'health and safety or conducting health and mortality studies. Since theproposed routine uses will provide access to the information to conductepidemiological studies of current and former workers at DOE facilitiesand to evaluate the Department's epidemiological program, the informationwill be used in accordance with the purposes for which the informationwas collected and maintained.The text of the system notice is set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on November 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles R.
