The interference due to bulk uranium has beenremoved by passing the sample through a cation exchange column beforeirradiation. The synthetic reference was analysed in order to assessthe accuracy and precision of the method. Consequently, the method isshown to be suitable for application to routine analysis of uranium sampleduring purification.</TEXT></DOC>
