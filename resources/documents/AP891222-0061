No pickup.</UNK><DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Romania's embattled leadership declared astate of emergency Friday as a popular revolt spread throughout thecountry, Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency reported fromBucharest.   Tanjug's report said the situation in the country that PresidentNicolae Ceausescu has ruled with an iron fist for 24 years was``dramatic.''   Some reports said Ceausescu was preparing to flee the country.   Troops reportedly killed at least 13 people in Bucharest onThursday in a crackdown on thousands of demonstrators who jeered aspeech by Ceausescu.   Various news agencies said Defense Minister Vasile Milea hadcommitted suicide. The British Broadcasting Corp. said he hadblamed himself for the nationwide unrest that was touched off bythe weekend massacre of hundreds of protesters in the western cityof Timisoara.   New protests reportedly occurred in Bucharest Friday morning,and Tanjug said security forces opened fire. There were no reportsof casualties.   Tanjug said protesters began gathering at 9:00 a.m. in thecapital, chanting ``join us, join us,'' as they marched through thestreets.   Later Friday, the Bulgarian state news agency BTA reported fromBucharest that the army had withdrawn from the streets and thatsoldiers were ``fraternizing with the people.'' It said that allpolice in front of the Intercontinental Hotel _ the scene ofprotests Thursday _ had withdrawn.   The massive unrest, reported in at least eight cities, indicatedRomanians have been caught up in the pro-democracy movementssweeping Eastern Europe and are no longer willing to tolerateCeausescu's repression and the harships he has forced on them.   There were reports of a general strike in Timisoara andsimilarly unconfirmed reports that a major factory in Bucharestwhich employs some 20,000 people had gone on strike on Friday.   Austrian television quoted Romanian exiles as saying Ceausescucould possibly be leaving the country and heading for exile inChina.   Western reports, citing witness accounts, said planes were seenbeing loaded at Bucharest airport with goods, indicating Ceausescuand his family could be preparing to leave.   Ceausescu declared a state of emergency in the Timisoara regionlate Wednesday, but the nationwide declaration indicated the unresthad spread to other parts of the country.   Romanian Television announced a special program on Friday andradio was playing military music, Hungarian Radio said.   A presidential decree said the state of emergency was necessarybecause of ``the serious violation of public order throughterrorist acts, vandalism and destruction of public assets,'' theBBC said, quoting Hungarian Radio.</TEXT></DOC>
