President Reagan launched his search Wednesday for Edwin MeeseIII's replacement and one of his first steps in the process was tomeet with the departing attorney general.   A lightning rod of controversy because of his conservativepolicies and his personal legal problems, Meese announced Tuesdayhe would be gone in a few weeks. He declared himself vindicated byan 830-page report on his official conduct compiled by independentcounsel James McKay, although he acknowledged he had not yet seenit.   The report has not been released by a special federal court.While sources have said the report recommends against a criminalindictment, its conclusions on Meese's ethical conduct remainunclear.   While no names of possible successors were volunteered at theWhite House, senators made sure that a steady list of possibilitieskept drifting from Capitol Hill to the White House.   Some lawmakers made telephone calls to administration officials.Others allowed their message to be carried by news reporters. Allagreed that the window for confirmation would be short.   Majority Democrats control the Senate schedule. Recesses alreadyare scheduled during the two national political conventions in Julyand August, and Congress might adjourn early during thepresidential campaign.   Two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, rankingRepublican Strom Thurmond and Democrat Dennis DeConcini, suggestedformer Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada as Meese's successor.Laxalt was considered the president's closest Senate ally beforeretiring.   Tom Loranger, a spokesman for Laxalt, quoted the former senatoras saying, ``There is absolutely no truth to the rumors about mygoing to the Justice Department.'''   Laxalt's secretary at his Washington law office, Janene Assuras,said her boss was ``not interested'' in the job, but didn't knowwhat he would do if Reagan asked.   DeConcini, of Arizona, also recommended former House Republicanleader John Rhodes from his home state.   Thurmond, of South Carolina, also had other suggestions: formerDemocratic Attorney General Griffin B. Bell, who served under JimmyCarter; and Reagan's first attorney general, William French Smith.   Responding to a reporter's question, Thurmond said formerTransportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole ``would make an excellentattorney general.''   Her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., suggestedthat former White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. andWashington lawyer Judith Richards Hope, daughter-in-law of comedianBob Hope, would qualify.   Baker resigned as chief of staff, effective June 30, to returnto private law practice in Tennessee. Mrs. Hope's nomination tosucceed Robert H. Bork on the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia has not yet been acted upon by the Senate.   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah and a Judiciary Committee member,favors acting Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen, of SaltLake City. A newcomer to the department, Christensen's confirmationhearing for the deputy's job is set for July 27.   Conservative Republican Sen. Steve Symms of Idaho rcommendedEugene Thomas of Boise, president of the American Bar Associationin 1986-87.   ``He doesn't have any scars and has an impeccable record,''Symms said.   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., suggested a homestate judge,Sol Wachtler, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. Histerm on the state court expires in January 1999.   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said Wednesday thathe believed Meese has ``weighed in'' on the question of hissuccessor.   Interviewed on Cable News Network, Meese was asked what kind ofperson he thought should succeed him.   ``I don't think anybody would be a clone of anybody else,'' hesaid. But Meese said he hoped the person selected is ``someone whosubscribes to the principles of Ronald Reagan and hisadministration.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded thatadministration officials had no contingency plan to find areplacement, even though Meese indicated some time ago he mightleave before the end of the administration.   ``We had an attorney general up until yesterday,'' Fitzwatersaid. ``We don't compile lists for positions where they're alreadyfilled.''   Fitzwater had said earlier that Meese told Reagan ``some timeago that he might want to leave before the end of theadministration. The president left the timing up to him.''   Reagan ``briefly discussed'' a successor for Meese with WhiteHouse chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and general counsel A.B.Culvahouse, the spokesman said.   If a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the timeMeese leaves, Fitzwater said, the administration probably wouldinstall Solicitor General Charles Fried in the job on an actingbasis.</TEXT></DOC>
