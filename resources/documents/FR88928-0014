This action is a result of the July 12, 1985, rulemaking inwhich EPA disapproved SIPs of states which failed to comply with the provisionsof 40 CFR 51.305 (visibility monitoring) and 51.307 (visibility NSR). EPAalso incorporated these Federal plans and regulations into the SIPs ofthese states.The Governor of North Dakota submitted a SIP revision for visibility protectionon January 26, 1988.

(``Mandatory Class I Federal areas''(hereinafter Class I areas) are certain national parks, wilderness areas,and international parks, as described in section 162(a) of the Act, 42U.S.C. 7472(a), 40 CFR 81.400-81.437.) Section 169A of the Act specificallyrequires EPA to promulgate regulations requiring certain states to amendtheir SIPs to provide for visibility protection.On December 2, 1980, EPA promulgated the required visibility regulationsat 45 FR 80084, codified at 40 CFR 51.300 <T3>et seq. </T3>The visibility regulations required the states to submittheir revised SIPs to satisfy these provisions by September 2, 1981. (See45 FR 80091, December 2, 1980, codified at 40 CFR 51.302(a)(1).) That rulemakingresulted in numerous parties seeking judicial review of the visibilityregulations. In March 1981, the court stayed the litigation, pending EPAaction on related administrative petitions for reconsideration of the visibilityregulations filed with the Agency.In December 1982, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed suit in theU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (<T3>EDF </T3>v. <T3>Gorsuch, </T3>Number C82-6850 RPA) alleging that EPA failed to performa nondiscretionary duty under section 110(c) of the Act to promulgate VisibilitySIPs. A negotiated Settlement Agreement between EPA and EDF required EPAto incorporate Federal regulations in states where SIPs were deficientwith respect to visibility monitoring (40 CFR 51.305) and NSR (40 CFR 51.307).However, the Settlement Agreement allowed each State an opportunity toavoid Federal promulgation if it submitted a SIP by May 6, 1985. NorthDakota was one of the states that did not meet this deadline. Final promulgationof Federal visibility monitoring and NSR regulations for all states, includingNorth Dakota, having deficient SIPs was published on July 12, 1985 (49FR 28544), and became effective August 12, 1985.On January 26, 1988, North Dakota submitted a SIP revision to EPA whichupdated its SIP, and added new regulations and revised various State regulations.Although the submittal contained various SIP revisions, only visibilityprotection for Class I areas is addressed in this action. Chapter 6, ``AirQuality Surveillance'', of the SIP was amended to include new section 6.10``Visibility Monitoring''. Also, North Dakota's ``Air Pollution ControlRules'' of the SIP was amended to include new Chapter 33-15-19 ``VisibilityProtection''. Included in the subject SIP amendments are plans and regulationswhich would replace the Federal provisions for visibility monitoring (40CFR 51.305) and NSR (40 CFR 51.307).<ITAG tagnum="84">Affected Areas</ITAG>The following areas in North Dakota are Class I areas where visibilityis an important value:<ITAG tagnum="21">Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Monitoring Strategy</ITAG>Under 40 CFR 51.305, all states with visibility protection areas are requiredto have a monitoring strategy for evaluating visibility in any Class Iarea by visual observation or other appropriate monitoring techniques.The purposes of this requirement are: (1) To generate data for evaluatingvisibility impairment trends, (2) to determine potential impacts of newsources, (3) to assess the effectiveness of the visibility protection program,and (4) to identify major contributing sources. These requirements canbe adequately addressed by determining the background visibility protectionareas and documenting the extent of any visibility impairment that canbe attributed by a source or small group of sources.Visibility impairment is the human perception of the effects of naturalor man-made conditions which reduce visual range or contrast, or changecoloration (49 FR 42671, col. 1, para. 2, October 23, 1984). Thus, a visibilitymonitoring program should identify these effects, as well as differentiateman-made effects from natural conditions. The program could generate varioustypes of data, such as reports from human observers, photographs, and/orautomated instruments. The minimum data collection technique that 40 CFR51.305 requires is visual observation. However, other more objective techniquesare available. (See ``Interim Guidance for Visibility Monitoring'', Officeof Air Quality Planning and Standards, November 1980 (EPA 450/2-80-082).)The goals of the North Dakota visibility program are: (1) To determinethe background visibility conditions, (2) to identify and remedy any existingvisibility impairment, and (3) to prevent future impairment of visibilityin Class I areas. In order to carry out these goals, North Dakota willassemble and evaluate any visibility data supplied by the Federal LandManagers (FLMs), collected by the State, and compiled by any appropriatesource through the visibility NSR program. North Dakota's visibility monitoringstrategy meets EPA criteria as outlined in 40 CFR 51.305.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Source Review</ITAG>States are required by 40 CFR 51.307 to review new major stationary sourcesand major modifications prior to construction to assess potential impactson visibility in any Class I area, regardless of the air quality statusof the area in which the source is located. That is, sources locating inattainment areas (hereinafter Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)stationary sources) and nonattainment areas must undergo visibility NSR.(See 40 CFR 51.307(a) and (b)(2), respectively.) These requirements ensure:(1) That the visibility impact review is conducted in a timely and consistentmanner; (2) that the reviewing authority considers any timely FLM analysisdemonstrating that a proposed source would have an adverse impact on visibility;and (3) the public availability of the permitting authority's conclusion.There are two parts to Visibility NSR: PSD major stationary sources andmajor sources in nonattainment areas. Because there are no nonattainmentareas in North Dakota, only the Visibility NSR requirements for PSD stationarysources are applicable at this time.For all PSD stationary sources:(1) The State must notify the FLM in writing not more than 30 days afterreceiving a permit application or advance notiifcation of application froma proposed source that may impact a visibility protection area.(2) This notiifcation must take place at least 60 days prior to the publichearing on the application and must contain any analysis of the potentialimpact of the proposed source on visibility.(3) The State must consider any analysis concerning visibility impairmentperformed by the FLM and received not more than 30 days after the notification.(4) If the State does not concur with the FLM's analysis that adverse visibilityimpairment will result from the proposed source, the State must provide,in its notice of public hearing on the application, an explanation of itsdecision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained.(5) The State must have the ability to require a permit applicant to monitorvisibility in or around the visibility protection areas.Items 1 through 5 for PSD stationary sources are the procedural steps invisibility review as defined in 40 CFR 52.27(d). (The provisions of 40CFR 52.27 were proposed in 49 FR 42670, October 23, 1984, and finalizedin 50 FR 28544, July 12, 1985.)Chapter 33-15-19-02 of the North Dakota Air Pollution Control Rules requiresany emission permit applicant to demonstrate that emissions from the proposedsource will not adversely impact visibility in a Class I area. The demonstrationmust be reviewed by the FLM, and any determination by the FLM must be consideredby the North Dakota Department of Health (Department) in its decision togrant or deny the permit. The permit will be denied for sources provento cause a potential impact. The SIP commits to the notification timeframe requirements of the FLM.Chapter 33-15-19-02-4 allows the Department to determine independentlyif there is an adverse impact to visibility in Class I areas if the Departmentfinds that the FLM's analysis does not satisfactorily demonstrate thatan adverse impact on visibility will result in a Class I area due to emissionsfrom a proposed source.<ITAG tagnum="84">FLM Coordination</ITAG>Under section 165(d) of the Act, the FLM is given an affirmative responsibilityto protect air quality related values which includes visibility in ClassI areas. The visibility regulations allow the FLM the opportunity to identifyvisibility impairment and to identify elements for inclusion in monitoringstrategies. The FLM must maintain these areas consistent with congressionalland use goals.The State of North Dakota has accorded the FLM (through the National ParkService (NPS) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)) opportunities toparticipate and comment on its Visibility SIP and regulations. Commentsby the NPS and the FWS were considered and incorporated where applicable.The State recognizes the expertise of the FLM in monitoring and in conductingnew source applicability analyses for visibility. The FLMs will be giventhe opportunity to comment on any visibility monitoring plan containedwithin a proposed permit to construct or operate a PSD stationary source.Additionally, North Dakota will give the FLMs the opportunity to commenton the State's visibility monitoring program on an annual basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA hereby approves the revisions to the North Dakota SIP for visibilitymonitoring and NSR because the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307,and the criteria discussed in 50 FR 28544 (July 12, 1985) are met. (SeeOctober 23, 1984 (49 FR 42670), for additional information.) The revisionswere submitted by the Governor on January 26, 1988. The submittal willreplace the Federal plans and regulations of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 inthe North Dakota SIP.EPA finds good cause exists for making the action taken in this noticeimmediately effective because the implementation plan revisions are alreadyin effect under State law or regulation and EPA's approval poses no additionalregulatory burden.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective 60 days from the date of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice unless, within 30 days of its publication,notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective November28, 1988.Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709, January 27, 1981.)Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuitby (60 days from publication). This action may not be challenged laterin proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See 307(b)(2) of the Act.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Particulate matter, Incorporation by reference.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Planfor the State of North Dakota was approved by the Director of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 1, 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
