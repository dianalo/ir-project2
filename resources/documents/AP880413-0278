Chairman Stephen M. Wolf has acontract paying $575,000 a year and a bonus worth more than $6.5million to replace stock options he formerly held at TigerInternational Inc., documents show.   According to documents filed with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the bonus is part of the Allegis stock plan offered toWolf when he was hired in December from Tiger, where he had servedas chairman and chief executive officer.   Allegis, the parent company of United Airlines, plans to changeits name next month back to UAL Inc., after recently shedding itshotel and rental car businesses.   Under the stock plan, Wolf has the right after Aug. 8 to be paidthe difference between the market price of the 590,000 Tiger shareshe had options on and a base price of $3.32 a share.   Tiger stock closed Tuesday at $14.75 a share on the New YorkStock Exchange, making the deal worth $6.7 million currently.   Allegis, the SEC filing says, ``recognizes that its compensationof (Wolf) must take into account at least a portion of the value''of his former Tiger stock options.   Besides the salary and bonus, Wolf is entitled to another annualbonus, an option to purchase 250,000 shares of Allegis stock andretirement benefits that give him credit for 22 years of service,the SEC filing says.   When asked Tuesday about the contract and any possible laborfriction because of its price tag, Allegis spokesman Joe Hopkinsdeclined to comment other than to confirm that the deal had beenmade.   Allegis is currently in contract negotiations with its flightattendants, who already have rejected the company's request forconcessions in exchange for a 4 percent wage increase over 42months.   Pat Friend, chairwoman of the United branch of the Associationof Flight Attendants, was in negotiations Tuesday and didn't returnphone calls requesting comment.   But F.C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United pilots union, said thesize of Wolf's contract wasn't a surprise.   ``We've always found it curious that management can alwaysjustify reducing costs everywhere but their own wallets,'' he toldthe Wall Street Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
