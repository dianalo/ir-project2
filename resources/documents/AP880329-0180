(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fiery evangelist Jimmy Swaggart wasordered Tuesday not to preach from the pulpit or his televisionshow for at least a year while he is rehabilitated from ``moralfailure'' that reportedly included paying a prostitute to pose nude.   In announcing its decision, the Assemblies of God eldersdisregarded a more lenient three-month suspension recommended bythe church in Louisiana. The national church included provisionsfor two years of rehabilitation and counseling to begin whenSwaggart has agreed to rehabilitation in writing.   Louisiana district officials refused comment, as did the JimmySwaggart Worldwide Ministries in Baton Rouge, La. But a spokesmansaid Swaggart's ministry would have a statement Wednesday.   Swaggart is the latest evangelist to be forced from the pulpit.His accuser, Marvin Gorman, was forced from the Assemblies of Godwhen he admitted to an immoral act with a woman. And Jim and TammyBakker were forced from their PTL ministry in a scandal thatincluded a sexual encounter between Bakker and young femalefollower.   ``It is hoped that Jimmy Swaggart will agree to this program ofrehabilitation and that such program will be redemptive andrestorative in the life and ministry of our brother,'' the Rev. G.Raymond Carlson, the church's general superintendent, said in astatement.   People approved by the church would supervise therehabilitation, Carlson said. He provided no other details.   ``If he does not accept, then the Executive Presbytery wouldtake action to dismiss him,'' Carlson said at a news conference.   Under the terms of rehabilitation, Swaggart would be barred fromhis pulpit for at least a year and would have to stop distributingvideotaped services that have enabled him to build a worldwidecongregation.   ``He will not be in the pulpit and he would not participate inthat kind of ministry _ he would not address his congregation, perse,'' Carlson said at the news conference. ``I believe we areasking him to be absent from television ministry.''   Church officials say Swaggart confessed to them in detail butthey have refused to make his transgression public. Reports havelinked him to a prostitute who says he paid her to pose naked.   Carlson said he called Swaggart on Tuesday to inform him of thechurch's decision, but the two did not discuss whether Swaggartwould accept rehabilitation.   ``He thanked me,'' Carlson said. ``He expressed thanks, and Ihad prayer with him over the telephone.''   Swaggart has 30 days to appeal to the 13-member ExecutivePresbytery, which serves as a board of directors and which set theterms of rehabilitation.   Church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said church elders, who havebeen grappling with the case since Swaggart stepped down from hispulpit Feb. 21, are unlikely to change their decision.   The Louisiana district had recommended that Swaggart be barredfrom preaching for three months. National officials say every otherAssemblies minister who has confessed to moral failure has beenbarred from preaching for at least a year.   The Louisiana district refused requests from the ExecutivePresbytery to reconsider, and apparently also questioned thenational leadership's authority to determine discipline.   H. Maurice Lednicky, a general presbytor and president of theAssemblies Central Bible College in Springfield, said the questionof authorities was the focus the presbytors meeting Monday andTuesday.   In the end, the 232-member General Presbytory, an oversightbody, decided that the Executive Presbytory had authority todiscipline Swaggart, said Carlson, a member of the ExecutivePresbytery. The presbytors later endorsed, on a voice vote, theterms of rehabilitation.   Robert S. King, a member of the Louisiana District Council fromLafayette, said he disagreed with the decision.   ``I feel his (Swaggart's) ministry is unique and much depends onit. I feel God has forgiven him, he has asked God and men toforgive him and we ought to forgive him. Ought to restore him tothe pulpit quickly,'' he said.   But Lednicky and other general presbytors in Springfield saidthey supported the Executive Presbytery. ``I think it helps notonly the ministers but the general public to feel that there isintegrity,'' he said.   Frank Martin, a general presbytor representing the Tennesseedistrict, said the decision ``showed mercy.''   After Swaggart's tearful confession to an unspecified sin, DebraMurphree, who has a record of arrests on prostitution charges, saidhe paid her to pose naked in a hotel room.   In a related development, the National Religious Broadcasters onFriday recommended terminating Swaggart's membership, theorganization's executive director said Tuesday. Termination doesn'tbecome final until approved by the group's board of directors,which meets next February.   `If they can't show the code and the logo like the GoodHousekeeping Seal of Approval on their programs it should affecttheir donations,'' said the Rev. Benjamin L. Armstrong, executivedirector of the 1,400-member organization.</TEXT></DOC>
