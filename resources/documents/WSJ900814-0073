It is onlyhis opinion.   And I disagree with him.</LP><TEXT>   What the Supreme Court seems to be saying in its latestruling on the First Amendment is not that free speech shouldbe shackled but rather that published opinions rendered onanother ought to be based at least on some semblance of fact,regardless of who is doing the rendering -- journalist,lawyer, securities analyst, banker, whoever. In layman'slanguage this means there's now some litigable limit on howloosely one's good name and reputation may be trashed inpublic. Somehow that strikes me as a fair attempt to rein inFirst Amendment abuses.   In other words, I would contend that most of us &quot;wuzhelped]&quot; not robbed by the court's decision.   Fraser P.
