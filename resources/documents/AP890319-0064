Then guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front attacked, bombing power poles and exchanging firewith National Guard troops on the rocky edges of this little town of3,600.   The fighting went on for nearly five hours, residents said,ending only two hours before the polls opened at 7 a.m.   The guerrillas had promised not to attack polling places orpeople who wished to vote, but even so the early turnout was light,poll officials said. Many blamed it on fear.   ``There is no question that the intimidation of the FMLN isworking,'' U.S. observer William Doherty said. ``The people arefrightened.''   One of the worst cases of nerves belonged, by his own admission,to Luis Flores, 33.   ``I am afraid,'' said Flores, a supporter of the rightistRepublican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, and an alternate memberof the local election board.   The guerrillas have denied that they threatened poll workers withdeath, but Flores and others said he was singled out.   ``They said: `Luis Flores, we know your turf. Expect us. We arecoming for you,''' he recalled tensely as mortars thudded in thedistance.   A few blocks away, on the hilly edge of town, repairs were underway on modest homes pocked by bullets or damaged by bombed utilitypoles, a favorite rebel target.   A man patching bullet holes in his front door was asked if he wasgoing to the polls.   ``If I have time after this,'' he said grimly, gesturing at hisplane and saw.   Worshippers leaving Palm Sunday mass streamed past polling placesin the own square. Few stopped to vote.   San Sebastian, which lies in San Vicente province, was only oneof the theaters of battle on El Salvador's election day.   The pattern was similiar elsewhere, with bombs and bulletssetting nerves on edge in the hours before the voting began.   San Sebastian, 30 miles east of the capital, reported nocasualties. In Ilobasco, in Cabanas province about 35 milesnortheast of San Salvador, there was death. But people stillstreamed to the polls.   The bodies of two recently killed guerrillas, a teen-age girl anda young man, lay on concrete slabs in the small open pavillion atthe town cemetery that serves as the morgue.   People crowded around for a glimpse of the fly-specked bodies.The two were killed in combat, townspeople said. A few blocks away,they lined up at 71 polling tables in a central plaza.   Despite fighting that raged from about 1 a.m. until about 4 a.m.,the city of 70,000 was not intimidated, Mayor Juan Antonio RodriguezTorres said.   ``We are not afraid to vote,'' he said. ``We are all here.''   Rodriguez, an Arena supporter, said no election workers hadresigned, despite threats broadcast on rebel radio and flyersscattered in the streets earlier in the week.   He said none of the officials were singled out by name as Floreshad been in smaller, more vulnerable San Sebastian.   Flores said none of the San Sebastian workers had resigned. Buthe was badly shaken that the guerrilla had taken the unusual step ofsingling him out.   ``I am afraid they are going to kill me,'' he said. ``Do you knowhow one would get to the United States?''</TEXT></DOC>
