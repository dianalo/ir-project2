The review covers one manufacturer and one third-country resellerin Hong Kong of this merchandise to the United States and the period May20, 1986 through November 30, 1987. The review indicates the existenceof dumping margins during the period. We determined that we were unable to verify adequately the manufacturer'stotal sales to the United States; and we were unable to verify recordsof payment for the merchandise exported to the United States by AmerportH.K., the third-country reseller. As a result, we used the best informationavailable for cash deposit and appraisement purposes. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> April 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Linda L.

Two importers requested in accordance with andSection; 353.53a(a)of the Commerce Regulations that we conduct an administrative review. Wepublished a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrativereview on January 27, 1988 (53 FR 2262). The Department has now conductedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classifiedsolely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Imports covered by the review are shipments of POS cooking ware includingtea kettles, which do not have self-contained electric heating elements.All of the foregoing are constructed of steel and are enameled or glazedwith vitreous glasses. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiableunder item 654.0815, 654.0824, and 654.0827 of the Tariff Schedules ofthe United States Annotated. The merchandise is currently classifiableunder HTS item 7323.94.00. HTS item numbers are provided for convenienceand Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers the shipments of one manufacturer in the PRC, China NationalLight Import and Export Corporation, Shanghai Branch (``CSLI''), and onethird-country reseller in Hong Kong, Amerport H.K., who exported the POScooking ware to the United States and the period May 20, 1986 through November30, 1987. Verification was conducted at Amerport H.K. from September 28through September 30, 1988, at CSLI from October 5 through October 9, 1988,and at Amerport U.S. from February 23 through 24, 1989. CSLI does not maintain journals or ledgers that are product specific. However,to verify total sales to the United States, CSLI provided copies of certainhandwritten accounting statements that purportedly represented the totalsales of enamelware products, which included POS cooking ware. Upon testingthe accuracy of these accounting statements, we found that they did notcontain a complete listing of U.S. sales. Based on our findings, we determinedthat we could not verify CSLI's total sales to the United States. During the verification in Hong Kong, the Department attempted to verifythe records of payment for the POS cooking ware exported by Amerport H.K.to the United States. Amerport H.K. claimed that these documents were maintainedby Amerport U.S. and not by Amerport H.K. As a result, the Department conducteda verification at Amerport U.S. At this verification Amerport U.S. claimedthat there was a misunderstanding because the records of payment were locatedat Amerport H.K. Prior to verification in Hong Kong and the United States,we sent verification outlines to both firms. These outlines stated thatthey were required to provide documentation such as records of payment,accounts receivable ledgers, cash receipts journals, etc. Because Amerportdid not provide the data, we were unable to verify the records of paymentfor sales and we were unable to complete the document traces normally employedfor verifying these payments. As a result, the Department used the best information available for bothCSLI and Amerport H.K., which was the rate published in the antidumpingduty order (51 FR 43414, December 2, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the followingmargins exist for the period May 20, 1986 through November 30, 1987:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,9</C> <H1/><T3>Manufacturer/Third-Country Reseller</T3><H1>Margin (Percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">China National Light Import and Export Corp., Shanghai Branch<D>66.65</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">China National Light Import and Export Corp., Shanghai Branch/AmerportH.K.<D>66.65</D></ITAG></ITAG> Interested parties may request disclosure and/or an administrative protectiveorder within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requesta hearing within 8 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, willbe held 35 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter.Prehearing briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may besubmitted not later than 25 days after the date of publication. Rebuttalbriefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in thosecomments, may be filed not later than 32 days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review,including the results of its analysis of any such comments or hearing.The Department has indications that there may be an agreement of reimbursementof antidumping duties between certain parties. Any reimbursement of dutiesto the importer is to result in an equivalent decrease in United Statesprice pursuant to 353.55 of the Commerce Regulations, and a consequentincrease in dumping duties. The Department, in its assessment instructions,will advise the U.S. Customs Service to investigate the <T3>bona fides </T3>of any certificate of non-reimbursement of duming dutieswhich may be filed by the importer. Id no such certificate is filed priorto the liquidation of each customs entry where dumping duties are finallyassessed, Customs will be instructed to double the amount of dumping dutieson each such entry, to account for reimbursement. The Department will issueappraisement instruction directly to the Customs Services. Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, a cash depositof estimated antidumping duties based on the above margins shall be required.For any further entries of this merchandise from a new exporter, not coveredin this administrative review, whose first shipments occurred after November30, 1987, and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm, a cash deposit of66.65 percent shall be required. These deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of porcelain-on-steelcookware from the People's Republic of China entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the finalresults of this administrative review.
