Only {gamma} ray emitting radionuclides were investigated. Thoseparts of vegetables normally considered inedible, for example coarseouter leaves, foliage or roots, can account for between 50% and 97% ofthe total radionuclide content. Washing of the edible parts of vegetablescan reduce the levels still further, although the efficacy is dependenton both the radionuclide and the vegetable type. These normal domesticprocedures can reduce intakes of recently deposited radionuclides onvegetables by about an order of magnitude. The results have implicationsfor the scope of monitoring programmes that might follow any future accidentalrelease. They also reinforce very strongly the requirement for measurementson edible parts rather than whole samples as a direct input to dose evaluation.These results further suggest that there is no need to revise the generalassumptions made in accident consequence models regarding losses of activitybetween harvest and consumption. However, more rigorous assessments ofdose should take account of vegetable type and probable means of preparation.</TEXT></DOC>
