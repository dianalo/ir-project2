(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. and Soviet negotiators, meetingunder the splendor of the snow-capped Rocky mountains, reached amajor breakthrough Friday on a treaty to slash long-range nuclearweapons arsenals.   They also neared completion of a separate accord that would openSoviet underground nuclear tests to on-site American inspection andvice versa, senior U.S. and Soviet officials reported. A Sovietofficial said a ``general framework'' for a pact had been naileddown, which if made final could end a deadlock on the ratificationof 15-year-old test ban treaties.   The breakthrough on strategic weapons came during an arms controlsession between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in a mountain lodge overlookingJackson Lake.   There, Shevardnadze informed Baker the Soviets had dropped theirdemand for completion of a treaty to limit space-based defenses _Star Wars _ before a separate pact to slash long-range bombers,missiles and nuclear submarines could be implemented.   ``I am not aware of any statement like that in the past,'' said aU.S. official who demanded anonymity.   ``The Soviets have shifted,'' he said.   Since the United States refused to yield to Soviet demands totrim its space-defense program, known popularly as ``Star Wars,''completing a treaty to reduce strategic weapons 30 to 50 percent wasimprobable.   Former President Ronald Reagan's summit meeting with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Iceland in 1987 fell apart over thedispute, which is known within the arms control community as``linkage.''   The shift in Soviet position was announced this way by the seniorU.S. official at a briefing for reporters:   ``In response to a question from Secretary Baker, Mr.Shevardnadze said they had dropped their linkage between completingan agreement in START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) and achievinga defense-in-space accord.''   The U.S. official repeated the statement thrice for emphasis. Hestressed a treaty to slash strategic weapons could be implementedeven without an agreement on U.S. and Soviet defenses.   ``This looks like a positive development,'' the official said.   He stressed President Bush intended to go ahead with the U.S.Strategic Defense Initiative launched by Reagan.   ``The President's commitment to that program is verywell-known,'' the official said.   Reagan announced the program in March 1983. From the outset theSoviets sought to stifle it.   But since 1987 the Soviets had said they were willing to permitsome Star Wars tests. The offer is under discussion at the talks inJackson Hole.   A Soviet spokesman, Boris Malakhov, said there would be no Sovietresponse to the American comments before Shevardnadze spoke at ajoint news conference today.   In another development, The Washington Post said in Saturdayeditions that the letter carried to President Bush by Shevardnadzefrom Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev called for an accelerationof meetings of foreign ministers aimed at a treaty on conventionalarms in Europe by the end of next year.   The inspection agreement would send scores of American inspectorsto the Soviet test site at Semipalatinsk to ensure that detonationsthat are part of the Soviet nuclear weapons program are within legallimits. It would also bring Soviet inspectors to the U.S. test sitein Nevada.   Scientists from both countries have monitored some of eachother's recent explosions as a test.   The current ceiling under unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties is aforce of 150 kilotons, or 150,000 tons of TNT. The bomb thatdestroyed Hiroshima in 1945 exploded with a force now estimated atabout 13,000 tons of TNT.   The Soviet official, who briefed reporters on the daylongBaker-Shevardnadze talks on condition that he not be identified,said that the two sides still had to decide the range of the smallblasts that could be excluded from inspection. The U.S. position isto have all tests between 50 and 150 kilotons subject to inspectionwhile the Soviets wanted to set the range between 75 and 150kilotons.   There would be no bar to underground explosions smaller thanwhatever floor is decided upon.   Tests in the atmosphere and in the ocean are banned by a 1963treaty.   The new agreement could pave the way for Senate ratification ofthe 1974 and 1976 treaties, which critics had contended did notcontain adequate safeguards against violations. In fact, formerPresident Ronald Reagan accused the Soviets in two reports toCongress of cheating _ charges the Soviets flatly denied.   The agreement clears the way for American use of a newsophisticated technique that measures the speed of destruction of acoaxial cable in a vertical hole near the blast, the so-calledCORRTEX technique.   Until now, measurements have been undertaken with seismicmethods, measuring the ground motion resulting from the blast _ justlike measurements of earthquakes.   The Soviet official said the agreement gives the two sides theoption on which method to use and his government still prefers theseismic approach.   ``The general framework has been agreed on,'' the Soviet officialsaid.   The other two tentative accords, announced during the lunchbreak, provides for advance notice of military exercises and anagreement in principle for ``trial verification'' of each other'sstockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons, according to the Sovietbriefer.   Some of those arms, such as cruise missiles carried aboardsubmarines and surface warships, are hard to track. This has slowedcompletion of a treaty to slash stockpiles of bombers, missiles andsubmarines by 30 to 50 percent.   The Soviet official said there were still differences over whichweapons to expose to inspection. He said the United States wasconcentrating on Soviet mobile missiles, while the Soviets wanted tocheck on a broader range of arms and factories.   Still, the headway on arms control reflected a generally goodatmosphere.   Not all went smoothly, though. One U.S. official, who alsorequested anonymity, said Baker had complained to Shevardnadze about``tremendous increases'' in Soviet bloc weapons shipments toNicaragua and Cambodia.   Posing for pictures at the start of two days of talks, Baker andShevardnadze looked over a meadow with the snow-dusted Grand Tetonmountains just beyond.   Two moose grazed in the sun-lit flats at the base of the peaks.   Baker joked that the animals had been chained to provide abucolic backdrop.   ``Yes, I notice that the moose are tied,'' the Soviet ministerreplied. After the two men left the terrace, the moose bolted intothe woods at the approach of television cameramen.   Baker, meeting with Shevardnadze in a lakeside lodge, said hehoped a new openness between the superpowers would lead to ``somesteps that are unprecedented.'' The nuclear test agreement wouldfall into that category.   Shevardnadze shared in Baker's upbeat mood as the two spokebriefly to reporters.   ``I would like especially to emphasize,'' he said, ``that it ishigh time for us to move from mutual understanding to mutualaction.''   Baker and Shevardnadze are scheduled to meet through Sundaymorning, when, after a fishing expedition, they will fly on an AirForce jet to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, whichopens on Monday with a speech by President Bush.   Shevardnadze addresses the assembly on Tuesday.   The talks here were also designed to narrow a time frame forBush's first summit meeting with Gorbachev sometime next year.   Shevardnadze, asked to comment on Bush administration statementsthat a summit would be held sometime next year, said, ``We'll bediscussing this today.''</TEXT></DOC>
