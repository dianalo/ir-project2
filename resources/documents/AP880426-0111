A Swiss Foreign Ministry statement made it clear that despiteU.S. opposition the Swiss government would accept Sayid MohammadHussein Malaek as ambassador.   The four-sentence statement followed a meeting between U.S.Ambassador Faith Ryan Whittlesey and State Secretary EdouardBrunner at which both sides presented their views in the case.   ``Thus, both sides consider the question as settled,'' it said.   ``We agree that the question is settled but we remaindisappointed,'' said Michael Korff, a U.S. Embassy spokesman.   In a separate press statement, Mrs. Whittlesay said ``allaspects of the recent press reports concerning the U.S.government's interest'' in Malaek were reviewed at today's meeting.   ``We have no intention of allowing our disappointment in thismatter to complicate the excellent relations that continue to existbetween the United States and Switzerland,'' the statement said.   Switzerland has been representing U.S. diplomatic interests inIran since Washington severed ties with Iran following the November1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Fifty-two Americanswere held hostage by Iranian militants for 444 days.   The Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper said Monday that Brunnerplanned to reiterate at his meeting that Switzerland does not havesufficient evidence to reject Malaek, who presented his credentialsMarch 22.   The newspaper said the ``Americans failed to present the Swissauthorities with a dossier compiling the evidence allegedlyincriminating Malaek.''   Korff said Friday that Malaek's role as one of the leaders inthe hostage-taking was so well known that fou Western countriesrefused to accept him as envoy.   The Neue Zuercher Zeitung said Korff was referring to Britain,Canada, Japan and the United States. Citing Swiss sources, it saidthe Canadians told the Foreign Ministry that they cannot recall anyrequest by Malaek for accreditation. In Britain, the IranianEmbassy is headed by a charge d'affaires who does not requireaccreditation. The newspaper said there was also ``no substantialinformation from Tokyo.''</TEXT></DOC>
