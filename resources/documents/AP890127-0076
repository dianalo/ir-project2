Eliasson inspected cease-fire lines in the region and wasscheduled to fly by helicopter to Baghdad later for meetings withsenior Iraqi leaders, including Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, U.N.officials reported.   Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador and Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar's special emissary, said before leaving Tehran:``It is very important to create a new momentum to speed up thetrend of future peace talks.   The negotiations began Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-sponsoredcease-fire in the 8-year-old gulf war took effect.   The talks ended in deadlock Nov. 11 after several sessions, withboth sides accusing the other of obstructing progress.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inCyprus, quoted Eliasson as saying at Tehran airport that his fourdays of talks with Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, Foreign MinisterAli Akbar Velayati and other officials were ``very useful andfruitful.'' He did not elaborate.   IRNA quoted Musavi as blaming Iraq for the deadlock by refusingto withdraw from territory Iran claims the Iraqis captured in aseries of offensives before the cease-fire took effect AUg. 20.   Before leaving Iran, Eliasson inspected the southern front linewith Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Lavasani, IRNA said.   The agency said the envoy was taken to an area where Tehran saidthe Iraqis captured several hundred Iranians after the Aug. 20cease-fire. Eliasson also saw three burning oil wells which theIranians said the Iraqis set afire.   ``After this visit, effective steps will be taken by thesecretary-general to secure the release of our prisoners and inhelping us extinguish these oil wells,'' IRNA quoted Lavasani assaying. He did not elaborate.   U.N. officials in Baghdad said Eliasson's talks were aimed atexploring possibilities for resuming the peace talks. No date hasbeen set for a new round of negotiations.   The talks have stalled on Iraq's insistence that a 1975 treatydrawing the southern border between the two countries down themiddle of the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway is invalid.   Before the treaty, the border ran down the eastern, Iranian bankwhich meant the Iraqis effectively controlled the waterway, theirmain outlet to the Persian Gulf. Iran insists the treaty is still inforce.</TEXT></DOC>
