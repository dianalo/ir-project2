A tough period of bargaining was expected to begin shortly onforming a new government, with the country's three major partieswidely divided over economic policy and the presence of U.S.military bases.   The result of Sunday's election could be another life forAndreas Papandreou's Socialists, who were felled in June's vote duein part to a banking scandal that has led to the former primeminister being indicted.   A government dominated by the Socialists would almost certainlyinclude Communists.   With 98 percent of the vote counted, New Democracy, led byConstantine Mitsotakis, had 46.3 percent for 148 seats in the300-seat Parliament.   That was three more than it won in June but three short of thenumber needed to control the government after eight years ofSocialist rule and a brief coalition administration.   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, won 40.7percent of the vote for 128 seats, a gain of three. TheCommunist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress got 10.8 percentof the vote and 21 seats, a loss of seven.   The other three seats went to independents _ a leftist backedjointly by PASOK and the Coalition, a Greek-Moslem and anenvironmentalist for the first time in Greece's political history.   ``Without a doubt, our political life is entering a difficultphase,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference on Sunday. e wasexpected to receive a presidential mandate within 48 hours to tryforming a new government.   After the June election, his party joined with the Communist-ledCoalition of the Left and Progress in an unusual alliance to launchinvestigations of scandals under Papandreou.   That administration resigned last month after Parliamentindicted Papandreou on charges of involvement in themultimillion-dollar banking scandal and of ordering wiretapping ofthe telephones of his friends and foes.   Papandreou has denied the charges.   ``It gives us special satisfaction that after the Juneelections, we have had such a significant rise ... despite theunbelievable barrage of attacks against us and despite the factthat we were out of the government,'' he told reporters on Sunday.   The leftist Coalition's loss of seven seats in Sunday's pollsuggested their supporters were unhappy about the alliance withconservatives.   The Communists vowed before the election that they would notwork with the conservatives again. However, they also said theywould not support the Socialists with Papandreou as leader.   After the Socialists' strong showing, it seemed certain thatthey would insist on keeping Papandreou in place.   The Athens Stock Exchange today reflected disappointment in theelection results.   ``Every stock opened lower this morning, apparently reacting tothe economic uncertainty we are in store for,'' said a brokerspeaking on condition of anonymity.   The daily Kathimerini newspaper, which supports theconservatives, called for ``a repeat of the successfulcooperation'' between New Democracy and the leftist Coalition.   Mitsotakis, 71, campaigned on promises to cut the government'sheavy role in the economy and strengthen ties with NATO and theUnited States. He accuses the former Socialist government ofruining the economy.   Papandreou, 70, promised to boost pensions and other benefits.He said he would hold a referendum before approving any new basetreaty with the United States.   The Coalition wants to remove U.S. bases from Greece and favorsa strictly controlled economy.   The inconclusive elections in June ended a 15-year period ofstable government dominated by Papandreou and another charismaticpolitician, pro-Western Constantine Caramanlis, who founded NewDemocracy in 1974.   Sunday's was the sixth election since the return to democracyafter the 1967-74 military dictatorship.</TEXT></DOC>
