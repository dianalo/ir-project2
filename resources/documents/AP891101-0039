Gorbachev, but he can beexpected to raise a number of issues. Here are some likely topics:</TEXT><TEXT>   EASTERN EUROPE: The two men must understand each other's plansand motives in dealing with the sweeping changes under way inEastern Europe. Gorbachev has said he will not intervenemilitarily, but some Westerners fear the situation could veer outof control, or that conservatives could topple Gorbachev and crackdown.   The government formed in Poland by the Solidarity trade union isseeking $1 billion in Western cash over the next five months toassist reforms that would dismantle the socialist economic systemthere. Hungarian reformers have scrapped that nation's CommunistParty and are preparing for multi-party elections and otherreforms. Refugees continue to flee East Germany, and protests thereare growing, raising questions about a possible reunification ofGermany. The government in Czechoslovakia is beginning to comeunder pressure to reform.</TEXT><TEXT>   STRATEGIC ARMS CONTROL: The Soviets have opened the door formajor progress toward a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by removingtheir condition that Washington agree in advance not to deploy StarWars defenses. But at a foreign ministers' meeting in September,the Soviets stressed they would pull out of a START accord if theUnited States breaks the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, whichbars space-based defenses.   The United States also dropped its call for a ban on mobilemissiles, another major impediment to START.   The two sides are divided over limits on submarine-launchedcruise missiles, how to count air-launched cruise missiles, and howto verify the reductions.   The proposed START pact calls for 30 percent to 50 percent cutsin superpower arsenals, to about 6,000 warheads apiece.</TEXT><TEXT>   CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL: Multilateral negotiations in Viennaare making progress toward cutting the conventional armies of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. Bush hasproposed allowing 275,000 U.S. and Soviet troops to remain inEurope; the Soviet proposal is 350,000. Both sides have agreed tolimit each alliance to 20,000 tanks, entailing a reduction of morethan half in Soviet bloc tanks. The two sides are divided over howmany tactical aircraft to allow. Other issues involve verificationand maneuvers.</TEXT><TEXT>   TRADE ISSUES: As part of his reform program, Gorbachev has beenpressing the United States to allow a wider range of business andfinancial transactions, but so far Bush has been cautious.Gorbachev wants the United States to allow Soviet participation inthe International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. He also wants Bush to waive provisions of theJackson-Vanik amendment that block the Soviet Union from mostfavored nation trading status as long as the Kremlin restrictsemigration. Although Jewish emigration is headed for all-timehighs, the administration is waiting until the Soviet parliamentenacts liberal immigration laws.</TEXT><TEXT>   CHEMICAL ARMS CONTROL: At the United Nations in September, Bushproposed that the superpowers cut their chemical weapon stocks by80 percent as a stimulus to 40-nation talks aimed at eliminatingthat class of weapons. The Soviets countered with a proposal thatthe superpowers dispose of all chemical weapons. But White Houseofficials later acknowledged that Bush planned to continuemanufacturing a new generation of so-called binary weapons whiledestroying older chemicals.</TEXT><TEXT>   REGIONAL ISSUES: Bush administration officials have complainedthat the Soviets have not reduced their military aid toKremlin-backed regimes facing domestic opposition, including thosein Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cambodia and Angola.   On Afghanistan, the administration says that after the Red Armypulled out last February, Soviet arms deliveries rose. Sovietofficials responded that the United States had violatedinternational accords that prohibit the shipment of arms acrossPakistan into Afghanistan.   On Nicaragua, the administration has said that although theSoviet Union may have stopped direct shipments of arms to theSandinistas, the Kremlin has made indirect shipments via Cuba ofarms worth about $350 million so far this year.   On Cambodia, the Soviet-backed Vietnamese government claims tohave withdrawn all its forces, ending an 11-year occupation, but aninternational conference last July failed to produce a formula fora new government. A government installed by Vietnam remains inpower battling the communist Khmer Rouge, backed by China, andnon-communist opposition forces, backed by the United States andThailand. Washington has withheld diplomatic recognition of Vietnampending a solution.   On Angola, the two leaders may try to solve the impasse that hasdeveloped following the collapse of a cease-fire between theKremlin-backed government and U.S.-backed guerrilla forcescommanded by Jonas Savimbi. Savimbi agreed to the cease-fire lastJune, but broke it a few weeks later. The Angolan government hascomplained that the United States has not granted it diplomaticrecognition, although about half of an estimated 50,000 Cubantroops there have withdrawn.   On the Middle East, Bush may ask Gorbachev to use his influencewith Soviet allies in the region _ Syria, Iraq and especially thePalestine Liberation Organization _ to promote a U.S. proposal fornegotiations between Israel and Palestinians in Israeli-occupiedlands. Israel has balked at the inclusion of PLO representatives.</TEXT></DOC>
