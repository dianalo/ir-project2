Electromagnetic immunity is very attractive for both data transmissionand sensing applications, particularly in the region of the engine compartment.Fibre optics will have their greatest impact where their use enablesengine parameters previously inaccessible to be monitored. This paperdiscusses the application of fibre optics to various aspects of internalcombustion engine monitoring including combustion sensing and in-cylinderpressure measurement. Analysis of intensity of the light emitted fromcombustion of the fuel in the cylinder allows a number of parametersof combustion to be measured and experimental results are presented.Fibre optics provide a remote sensing ability which allows the detectionand processing electronics to be mounted in a less hostile environment.A fibre optic pressure sensor is described that offers a simple low costdevice providing another useful combustion parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
