Kohl's comments came after leaders of his conservative ChristianDemocratic party gathered to assess the damage done in Sunday'selections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.   The chancellor's party was ousted from power in the state forthe first time in 38 years, losing nearly 10 percent of the vote.   But the election was a decisive victory for the oppositionSocial Democrats, who won 54.8 percent of the vote after they hadlost ground in a string of state elections over the past 18 months,according to the unofficial figures.   The results were the best-ever posted by the Social Democrats inSchleswig-Holstein, giving the party 46 of the 74 seats in thestate's parliament, an increase of 10 seats from the previouselection.   Unofficial results showed the Christian Democrats won 33.3percent of the vote and 27 seats, down from 33 seats.   Sunday's vote was called to break the stalemate in the state'sgovernment that followed an inconclusive election in September 1987.   In that contest, the Christian Democrats polled 42.6 percent ofthe vote, while the Social Democrats got 45.2 percent.   ``The clashes that occurred from time to time certainly did nothelp us,'' said Kohl, speaking of the in-fighting within histhree-party federal coalition in Bonn.   The chancellor also told reporters that a principal cause of theunexpectedly large loss was ``the deep shock that lingered'' fromthe Barschel affair, one of the biggest domestic scandals to hitWest Germany in recent years.   Uwe Barschel served as the Christian Democratic governor inSchleswig-Holstein until he resigned last fall after news of apolitical dirty tricks campaign surfaced in the West German media.   Barschel was found dead in a Geneva hotel room in October, andauthorities ruled his death an apparent suicide.   Meanwhile, the youth wing of Kohl's Christian Democrats calledon the chancellor to reshuffle his Cabinet as a means of offsettingthe Schleswig-Holstein election loss.   ``A freshening-up of the coalition with younger people isurgently called for,'' Christoph Boehr, head of the Youth Union,was quoted by the Bild newspaper as saying.   After meeting with Christian Democratic leaders, Kohlacknowledged to reporters that his party had suffered a ``seriousloss'' in the state elections.   But the chancellor said he was convinced the coalition wouldcontinue to be popular and predicted it would be re-elected in the1990 federal elections.   Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, head of the ChristianDemocrats in Schleswig-Holstein, said at the same news conferencethat he had no intention of resigning his party position because ofthe election debacle.   The liberal Free Democratic party _ the junior party in Kohl'sgoverning coalition _ also posted losses, falling from 5.2 percentof the vote in September to 4.4 percent Sunday.   The loss was decisive, because the Free Democrats failed to winthe minimum 5 percent of the vote. Under West German law, a partymust win at least 5 percent of the vote to take any parliamentaryseats. As a result, the Free Democrats lost all four of theirplaces in the parliament.   The environmental Greens party also failed to win parliamentaryseats after receiving only 2.9 percent of the vote _ well below the3.9 percent it won in September.   It will be several days before the results, based on returnsfrom polling stations, are verified and declared final under WestGerman law.   Political analysts say the Social Democratic majority assuresthat the state governor's post will go to Bjoern Engholm, theparty's candidate for the position.   The election turnout was 77.4 percent, up slightly from 76.6percent last September.</TEXT></DOC>
