CARNEGIE andamp; CO., in a bid to defuse mounting controversy, said it would be willing to sell the 20% stake in POST-OCH KREDITBANKEN it has agreed to take in exchange for its brokerage unit.    Carnegie also said it would be willing to forego the voting rights of the newly issued shares in PKbanken, the Swedish state-controlled bank, to help make the proposed 2.7 billion-krona ($459.9 million) transaction more politically acceptable.    Meanwhile, the Swedish government agreed to hold a parliamentary vote on the sale by early summer.    Yesterday's developments followed two weeks of debate over whether the government -- which recently has moved to stem a spate of large corporate acquisitions in Sweden and to control the country's booming capital markets -- should get into the brokerage business, and over whether Carnegie should become the largest private shareholder in PKbanken. Carnegie is controlled by financier Erik Penser, who is criticized in some quarters for moving out of Sweden to avoid high taxes and for his interest in Bofors AB, a unit of his Nobel Industrier Sverige AB group. Bofors has been investigated for arms-smuggling and bribery.    Questions also have been raised over whether the government may have been charged a high premium for Carnegie's brokerage unit. </TEXT></DOC>
