Early indications were that Schrack was right. Students driftedaway from schools or prepared to sit out the day under the watch ofhastily hired substitutes.   ``We're going to be stuck in a gym. All we're gonna do is sitand vegetate,'' complained 15-year-old Hamilton High Schoolfreshman Maureen Lim as teachers marched in front of the buildingin West Los Angeles.   United Teachers-Los Angeles, representing 22,000 teachers, isdemanding a 21 percent pay hike over two years and more controlover classrooms. Although district administrators said schoolswould remain open with substitute teachers, union President WayneJohnson called that ``a joke, at best.''   Johnson, who joined picketing teachers at Hamilton High, saidinformal talks would be held again today with the district, but noformal negotiations had been set.   ``I'm hopeful that it won't go more than two or three days,'' hesaid of the strike. ``There's still a possibility that mighthappen, but that depends on the board.''   Signs carried by picketing teachers read ``We Deserve Better''and ``We Need Equal Say and Fair Pay.''   Attendance figures for the district's more than 600 schoolsschools were still being taken early today, so the effect ondistrict-wide attendance could not immediately be determined.   The first picket lines formed at about 2 a.m. when about 30teachers marched in front of district warehouses in an attempt toblock Teamsters union drivers from delivering food later thismorning.   ``For too long teachers and students have been at the end of thepecking line instead of at the front where they should be,'' saidone of the pickets, Leo Hildebrand, a fifth grade teacher atGarvanza Elementary School.   By 6 a.m., picket lines were forming in front of schools.   ``Enough is enough,'' said teacher Carole Rosen-Kaplan, one ofabout 30 pickets at the Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, asection of the suburban San Fernando Valley. ``We've taken all theinsults we're going to take.''   Board of Education President Roberta Weintraub, speaking for themajority on a deeply divided school board, said the district wouldnot budge from what she termed one of the best contract offers forteachers in the nation.   ``The lines on this issue have been clearly drawn and the ballis in the union's court,'' she said.   The strike deadline was pushed up two weeks, from May 30 to May15, when Superintendent Leonard Britton refused to authorize payfor teachers who failed to turn in final grades.   About 500 hastily hired substitutes and another 500 credentialedadministrators lined up to teach the district's 594,000 students.   Johnson ridiculed the plans, saying, ``The district can'tprovide enough substitutes on a normal day.''   With five weeks remaining before summer vacation, the strikethreatened to create havoc at the schools, with high absenteeism,large and unruly classrooms, and students' final grades determinedby substitutes.   The school year ends June 23 for students and June 26 forteachers.   ``We are really hoping we can keep our schools open as safely aspossible, and to that end, of course, the district will be workingnight and day,'' Weintraub said.   Teachers stood by their demands for higher pay and more say inhow schools are run.   United Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents 22,000 of the32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, has been locked in acontract battle with the district for more than a year.   The union has been adamant in its demand for a 21 percent payincrease over two years and the elimination of unpaid, non-teachingduties such as school yard supervision and after-school meetings.It also seeks to give teachers more influence in how theirclassrooms are run.   The district has offered teachers a 21.5 percent pay raise overthree years _ with the possibility of more money if an anticipatedincrease in state revenue materializes.   The sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District, with astudent body that speaks 85 languages, is second in size to NewYork City and hasn't been struck by teachers since a 23-day walkoutin 1970.   Los Angeles teachers' salaries start at $23,440 and can go ashigh as $43,319. Administrators' salaries range from $37,000 to$95,600.   The average U.S. teacher salary is $29,567, according to theNational Education Association. Average salaries range from $20,480in South Dakota to $41,693 in Alaska.   The New York City school district, the nation's largest, paysteachers from $23,000 to $45,800.</TEXT></DOC>
