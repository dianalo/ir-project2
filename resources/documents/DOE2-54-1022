Theground electrodes may have arbitrary separation, number, geometric configurationand resistance although examples are restricted to linear, periodic groupings.The ground electrodes are replaced by ground-point current sources. Interactionsbetween the ground electrodes and the measurement array are describedby a matrix equation, and the ground-point current source magnitudesare found by performing a matrix inversion. The potential at a fieldpoint due to the ground-point current sources and the measurement-arraycurrent sources is then readily found and compared to the undisturbedfield-point voltage to produce normalized resistivity profiles. Resultsare presented for the pole-pole, the Schlumberger and the dipole-dipolearrays. In general, the effect of large structures, such as power lines,is to produce effects of only a few percent on traverses parallel andnormal to the structure. 9 refs., 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
