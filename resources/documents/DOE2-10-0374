For the high corrosive character of the environmentalconditions in pipes containing acid gas these cutting ring pipe connectionsare made of X10CrNiMoTi1810. However, the occasional failure of suchconnections demonstrates that it is not sufficient only to change thematerial to cope with these conditions. Based on the analysis of failurereasons a novel cutting ring with geometry, working principle, materialand surface treatment specially chosen for this usage was developed andtested. Besides, this ring agrees in its outer dimensions with the appropriateGerman standards (DIN) to enable its usage in standard pipe connectionelements.</TEXT></DOC>
