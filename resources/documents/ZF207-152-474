Wilson, director of son corp. of America's Optical StorageTechnology Group in Park Ridge, N.J.andP;  Within two years several systems shouldbe installed with users enjoying the results of the systems, he said.andO;Agencies still have a narrow view of what optical technology is and think ofoptical technology in generic terms, Wilson said.andM;With the different diameters, form factors, and read and write methodsavailable, users can choose from nine different technologies, Wilson said.andO;&quot;Diameter is important, but the technology is essentially the same whenconsidering an application,&quot; he said.andM;Agencies do not have to worry that if they invest in 12-inch writeonce/read-many times technology that it will be made obsolete by 5-1/4-inchtechnology, Wilson said.andP;  The capacity of the 12-inch always will be aboutsix times greater, and that will never change because it is a function of thediameter of the disk, he said.andM;While 12-inch media is good for archiving massive amounts of data, the5-1/4-inch media is well-suited as a distribution media and has a lower entrycost for agencies without a great deal to invest in an image system pilot oroperational system, Van Schoor said.andM;Cygnet has been working with Mitek Systems Inc., San Diego, to create aTempest version of Cygnet's Series 5000 5-1/4-inch jukebox, which is expectedto be released by July, Van schoor said.andM;Optical disks have proved themselves to be an inexpensive way to store largeamounts of data, but in a few years a new technology could be cheaper andbetter, Hooton said.andP;  As long as data can be dumped from the optical media toa new system without anything being lost, agencies should not worry about themedia form, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
