The planet Venus is the brightest ``star'' in the sky, and willbe visible in the southwest as night falls.   It will be shining close to the thin crescent moon, making for adramatic view, reports Sky andamp; Telescope Magazine.   Millions of people went outdoors to watch a similar event in thespring of 1988, according to the popular astronomy magazine.   At sunset, the planet will appear to the right of the crescentmoon. Also visible should be Saturn, to the upper left, though itwill be much fainter.   With luck, the magazine adds, viewers may be able to observe thephenomenon of ``earthshine.''   That is the reflected light from the Earth brightening thenormally dark portion of the moon so it becomes visible, althoughnot as bright as the crescent portion which is lighted by sunlight.   Because the dark section of the moon glows dimly gray when thisoccurs, it has been called ``the old moon in the new moon's arms.''   Though Venus and the moon look close together at this time, theyare really more than 65 million miles apart.</TEXT><NOTE>Congresswoman: Moslem, Christian Leaders Pledged Help For Hostages</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Moslem and Christian leaders want to work forthe freedom of Western hostages held by extremists in Beirut, saysan Ohio congresswoman who defied the State Department with anunsanctioned trip to Lebanon.
