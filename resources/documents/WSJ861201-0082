GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/01/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FORGN LATAM AFRIC MDESTEXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   For six years, President Reagan pursued an activist and often covert foreign policy. Now the excesses of his administration's actions may force him to settle for an overt and probably passive program during his remaining time in office.    Last week's disclosure that profits from the secret sale of American weapons to Iran were used to finance the Nicaraguan Contras, violating the spirit and perhaps the letter of U.S. law, has infuriated Congress and even angered members of the administration who were left in the dark.    The outcry could kill the chances of further support for the Contras. It also jeopardizes other secret administration operations embodied in the so-called Reagan Doctrine, including support for guerrillas battling Angola's Marxist government.    The Iran incident leaves the administration with other self-inflicted wounds. Mideast diplomacy is in shambles. The disclosure that Israel acted as the middleman in the Iranian arms sales confirms the darkest suspicions of moderate Arabs that American actions in the region are closely coordinated with Israel. Further, the appearance that no one is in charge at the White House -- and the reality that Democrats are in charge in Congress -- could convince the Soviet Union to write off Mr. Reagan and await his successor.    As the administration tries to pick up the pieces, an angry Congress is insisting on closer control over the making of foreign policy and almost certainly will rein in the administration's foreign policy adventurism.    &quot;This is like throwing a bone to a starving dog,&quot; says Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. &quot;Congress will latch on to it and see it as a major opportunity for oversight. I think out of it will come some recommendations and possibly legislation designed to prevent this fiasco from happening again.&quot;    The administration's problems are compounded by the Republican loss of the Senate. During the past six years, GOP Senate leaders frequently saved the White House from its tendencies to dismiss the advice of its own domestic allies, bypass Congress and rely on President Reagan's charisma to carry the day.    For example, Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), the outgoing chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, convinced the White House to withdraw a Mideast arms sale that was doomed. He also persuaded the president to belatedly join Congress, and many in his own administration, in calling for the end of Ferdinand Marcos's dictatorship in the Philippines.    &quot;I don't know whether the White House appreciated what friends they had&quot; in Congress, says Sen. Lugar. Now, &quot;it's a new ballgame, and I think the president has to recognize that,&quot; he adds.    Congress cut off aid to the Contras in 1984 after it learned about a Central Intelligence Agency effort to sow mines in Nicaraguan harbors. After much presidential persuasion, lawmakers this year approved $100 million in aid for the Contras. But an irate Congress now might reduce that or reject new funding because the administration countenanced the transfer of funds from terrorist-sponsoring Iran to the Nicaraguan rebels    &quot;The last thing the Contras needed was to have (AyatollahRuhollah) Khomeini tied to them,&quot; observes James Schlesinger,a former cabinet officer in both Democrat and Republicanadministrations.   Guilt by association also could kill a covert program approved by Congress that funnels funds to Jonas Savimbi, a guerrilla leader fighting the regime in Marxist Angola. Mr. Savimbi relies heavily on support from South Africa, and lawmakers, looking for excuses to slap down the administration, could attack the program. &quot;Aid to Savimbi will be forced to become overt, and a Congress that has overridden the president's veto on South African sanctions is likely to take a somewhat jaundiced view of South Africa's ally,&quot; says Mr. Schlesinger.    In the Mideast, the U.S. committed the sin of not notifying its moderate Arab friends that it was selling arms to Iran even as it was preaching a tough anti-terrorism sermon to other nations. The result is a severe loss of credibility for Mr. Reagan and the perception that he is losing clout at home.    President Reagan's best chance of repairing his presidency may be to push for an arms agreement with the Soviets. But this would require compromising his &quot;Star Wars&quot; defense plan, and conservatives will argue strongly against this.    Meanwhile, &quot;the floodgates have been opened,&quot; says Fred Dutton, a former State Department official and now a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia. &quot;Water runs uphill to the (Capitol) Hill on this one. We could be in for months of investigations and hearings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
