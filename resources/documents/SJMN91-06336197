The peasants rail, quaff Pastis and chew on theirGitanes. The sun will shine, and Provence is still Provence.;   But thecliche-ridden style that made Englishman Peter Mayle's &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;and its follow-up, &quot;Toujours Provence,&quot; runaway best-sellers is only part ofthe picture.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PROVENCE PLEASURESMAKE GORDES YOUR JUMPING POINT FOR SOUTHERNTOURING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Destination: France; See also related article on page 7T of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;And hey, we're still people here -- this is a viable town with a school,church and small-town shops,&quot; says Lynda Mazet, who owns a tophotel-restaurant, the Bastide, in Gordes, not far from Mayle's territory inMenerbes. &quot;Our men don't all lug baguettes and wear berets.&quot;;   Some nativesand many expatriate settlers around this southern area, known variously as theVaucluse or the Luberon, were furious at Mayle's first book, claiming itbrought busloads of gawkers, and queries to every other farmer about sellinghis property.;   Though already something of a tourist haven with a certainamount of souvenir-hawking, Gordes is a charming base for touring the region.;  Plenty to do;   Its stunning views, interesting art museum, refurbishedancient houses and curious beehive historic structures offer lots ofdiversion.;   It's no secret that an international array of artists, writersand celebrities have made the Luberon their country-hideaway since it was&quot;discovered&quot; after World War II by artist Marc Chagall.;   Some of thedenizens relaxing in the area include Englishman Barry Sainsbury of groceryfamily fame, American artist Joe Downing from Horse Cave, Ky., and Americanpublishing tycoon John Fairchild. .;   Visitors to Gordes can hardly miss theRenaissance chateau leased by painter Victor Vasarely to show off his work asa complement to the monumental Vasarely museum in Aix-la-Provence.;   Countrymarket enthusiasts should spend a Tuesday morning in Gordes, when farmers,artisans and caterers of the Luberon set up shop on the central square.;  Besides jewelry and pottery, you can revel in the veritable mosaic of olives,succulent jams, condiments, honey and olive oils.;   Real country fare;   Andtry a sample of country specialties from Francois Moussu, who regularly toursthe region's markets, offering adventurous fare such as &quot;rooster in beer&quot; stewor preserved tripe in wine, made by him at his own farm.;   Antique buffsshould catch the flea and antiques market at nearby Isle-sur-la-Sorgue onweekends.;   Les Bories, just outside Gordes, is a village of restoredbeehive-like limestone structures apparently used since time immemorial tohouse shepherds and their flocks. This group is supposedly 14th-century, andthe restored huts look spartan uncomfortable.;   Just a few kilometers away isSenanques Abbey, a moving Provencal site. Set in a desolate hollow under theLuberon mountains, the Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century (andlately restored) offers a special magic if you arrive around sunset and hearechoes of the monks intoning vespers with singing cicadas as background.;  Besides Menerbes, with its spectacularly perched cemetery looking like theprow of a ship, there are other high points -- at Roussillon, Lacoste andBonnieux. Roussillon is a riot of pinks, ruddy reds and ochre, a stage set ofa village carved from its native stone. Lacoste is notable for a craggy ruin,once the stomping ground of the Marquis de Sade.;   Hiking is a favoriteactivity, and hiking maps are obtainable through the Gordes Syndicatd'Initiative (tourist office).;   Touring here you're bound to work up ahearty appetite, and the region has plenty of bistros and restaurants tosatisfy.;   Among the most picturesque and very best is Lynda Mazet's Bastide.Hanging precariously over a ravine below the town square, the hotel in aconverted old gendarmerie offering stunning views.;   After a hefty investmentof over $3 million by the Mazet family three years ago, the wreck that hadbeen pock-marked by bullet holes since resistance fighting in World War II wasturned into a luxurious hostelry.;   The chef, Alain Soliveres, has gained anenthusiastic following with his seasonal food based on local produce andingenuity. Some recent delights included cream of pumpkin soup with gratedfresh truffles and sauteed shellfish with butterfly pasta.;   Also in Gordes,&quot;Le Victuailler,&quot; mainly a catering establishment, gets kudos for intriguingdishes.;   Patrick Payet's Le Tonneau in Goult offers charm in an antique,farm-tool decor.
