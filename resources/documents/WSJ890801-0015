The holders of other foreign hostages in Lebanon threatened to kill another American unless the clergyman is released.

A spokesman for Premier Shamir called the claims about Higgins &quot;odious,&quot; but said Israel remains ready to trade Moslem prisoners for hostages.    ---   Cambodian peace talks appeared stalled in Paris amid accusations against the Khmer Rouge.
