Three unexploded bombs were found and a firebomb was hurled at apolice station today, after the blasts at the dormitory early thismorning and late Thursday night.   The violence occurred as 26,000 police officers were mounting amassive security operation for the Tuesday coronation.Representatives from more than 150 countries are to attend,including Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles.   Although scores of strategically located buildings or thoserelated to the imperial household, city utilities and other likelytargets have been singled out for special attention under thesecurity operation, police dormitories were not included in thelist.   ``I feel a very strong anger at the violent outrage of theultra-leftist groups,'' Tachio Ohori, head of the MetropolitanPolice Department, told Japanese reporters in a hastily arranged,predawn news conference called after he inspected the blast site.   ``With all the strength of the department we hope tosuccessfully carry out security for the upcoming coronation,'' hewas quoted as saying in several major newspapers.   No group claimed responsibility as of this evening. Japaneseradical groups generally take several days to issue suchstatements.   Officer Hiroshi Aoki, 48, died almost immediately after thefirst blast at 11 p.m. Thursday at the dormitory in a Tokyodistrict known for its numerous nightspots. The second bomb wentoff about five minutes later. Officials said earlier that the bombsexploded two hours apart.   A Metropolitan Police Department official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity, said the injured included four otherofficers, the dorm's cook and another civilian.   The official said the type of explosives and other details ofthe blasts, separated by about two hours, were under investigation.Both bombs had been placed near a garbage collection area insidethe dormitory complex, officials said.   Along with the dormitory blasts, police reported finding twomore bombs near another police dormitory about an hour after thefirst blasts, and at a public restroom elsewhere in the capitalearly today.   In central Japan, a Molotov cocktail was lobbed at a policestation before dawn. No injuries were reported.   Leftist radicals, including the 5,000-member Chukaku-ha, orMiddle Core Faction, have repeatedly vowed to use violence to``destroy'' the coronation and other related ceremonies. Theyconsider the emperor a symbol of Japan's militarist past and opposestate funding of the enthronement.   Last month police announced they would increase the securitydeployment to 32,000 by busing in reinforcements for the coronationday. On Wednesday it was revealed that they are considering afurther increase of thousands more.   ``We have not made a final decision, but an increase is beingconsidered because of the increasing difficulty of the situation,''a National Police Agency official said.   Metropolitan Police Department officials today also refused tocomment on whether the thousands will be added.   Leftist radicals have been particularly active in anti-imperialactivities since the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in February lastyear.   Although police mobilized 32,000 officers in Tokyo to guard thatceremony, the Chukaku-ha set off a bomb along the funeralprocession route. The bomb exploded before the procession arrived,and no one was injured.   Over the past month, police have announced uncovering allegedplots by the Chukaku-ha to jam television broadcasts of thecoronation and fire rockets at a tunnel along a train route theemperor is to travel later this month.   The radical group is believed to have mortar-style weapons witha range of 4 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
