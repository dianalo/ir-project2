Dillon Securities Inc. and Lyle R. Haas, Spokane, Wash., were disciplined for failing to to prepare accurate net capital computations. The firm was fined $20,000 and Mr. Haas, $10,000. They have appealed the sanctions to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Leumi Securities Corp. and Zvi Amit, a registered principal, New York, were each fined $15,000; without admitting or denying the allegations, they consented to findings that they failed to maintain the appropriate amount in a special account for the exclusive benefit of customers.

Most of the individuals cited couldn't be reached, or declined comment.    Mr. Sargent called the NASD's allegations &quot;a trumped up deal&quot; involving claims that he was selling unregistered stock. He said the transaction involved $130,000 for a mining project raised from 20 to 25 investors who were offered loan repayments or stock in the mine. He said he didn't respond to NASD reporting requirements because the self-regulatory body &quot;chose to ignore the facts I gave them in a previous situation.&quot;    Mr. Schwabe said, &quot;I'm no longer in that industry and I don't plan to pursue a career in it.&quot; He added that full restitution, with interest, was made, &quot;which is unusual.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
