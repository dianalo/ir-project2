<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-40-0395 </DOCNO><TEXT>Measurements of the dynamic performance of eight different digitizersare presented and analysed to show the types and magnitudes of errorto which each digitizer is prone. The impact of these errors on the measurementsof fast single-shot transients, such as front chopped impulses with times-to-choppingin the range of 500 ns (the fastest covered by the standards) to a fewns, is examined. The suitable range of application of each digitizeris deduced. This presentation is intended to aid others in selectingsuitable digitizers for recording fast transients such as occur whenswitching gas-insulated HV apparatus, when measuring zinc oxide arrestercharacteristics, and when testing the compatability of instrumentationto pulsed electromagnetic fields. 17 refs., 12 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
