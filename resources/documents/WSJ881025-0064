Since last January, premiums for many health-care plans have increased between 10% and 30%. Looking ahead to the next 12 months, a survey of 14 major insurers by Noble Lowndes, a benefits-consulting firm in East Orange, N.J., shows they expect premiums to jump an average of 22%.    Some increases will be &quot;in the 40% to 50% range,&quot; predicts David Brenneman, vice president at Noble Lowndes. &quot;What's worse is that some insurers are offering rates that are good for only three months. Normally, rates are good for 12 months.&quot;    Says Marie Dufresne, a senior vice president in the New York office of Hay/Huggins Co., a benefits-consulting company: &quot;This year was a killer, and I don't expect it to be much different next year.&quot; Although benefits managers claim they are reluctant to push costs on to workers, health-industry economists say companies may have little choice.    &quot;We've been looking for painless solutions,&quot; says Jon Gabel, associate director for research and statistics at the Health Insurance Association of America, in Washington, D.C. Now, he says, &quot;there has to be more cost sharing.&quot; Adds Gail Jensen, assistant professor of health economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago: &quot;Firms seem to be doing everything but what has proven to work: cost sharing.&quot;    Indeed, the measures companies have adopted in recent years to contain health costs have produced mixed results. A look at those measures, as well as several other issues, helps explain why insurance premiums will rise again in 1989. -   OUTPATIENT SERVICES: For many companies, growth in outpatient services remains the biggest obstacle to controlling health costs. In recent years, employers have been able to reduce hospital expenditures by closely monitoring patient admissions and by giving workers incentives to have minor surgery in outpatient clinics. But the incentives have worked too well: Employers say the number and cost of outpatient claims have exploded. The bill for cataract surgery in some clinics is now $4,000 -- twice the cost of the same procedure in some hospitals, says Theodore J. Nussbaum, a partner at the accounting firm of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, New York. At Northwestern National Life Insurance Co. in Minneapolis, spending for outpatient services among its clients has jumped almost 70% since 1983, while spending for hospital services has increased only 27%.    HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS: HMOs have long been promoted as less expensive alternatives to doctors in traditional fee-for-service practices. But in a recent study by Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby Inc., a New York management consultant, less than 25% of 163 surveyed companies said their HMOs helped reduce health costs. Part of the problem, benefits managers say, is that HMOs usually siphon off a company's youngest, healthiest workers. This drives up the cost of traditional health plans, which are left with relatively older workers. Meanwhile, the crowded HMO industry is facing a shakeout, leading some HMOs to raise prices in attempts to survive.    COST SHIFTING: Some hospitals and doctors are submitting inflated bills to traditional corporate health plans to offset cutbacks in payments from Medicare and managed-care plans. &quot;Obviously, if you cut down on hospitals' inpatient days, they've got to make it up someplace else,&quot; says Reezin Swilley, director of benefits at BellSouth Corp. in Atlanta. Corporate health plans, he says, &quot;are a convenient place to tag some increases.&quot; Hewitt Associates, a benefits-consulting firm in Chicago, estimates that cost shifting alone is responsible for one-third of the annual increase in some companies' medical bills.    TECHNOLOGY: &quot;We have expensive {medical} procedures now that we didn't see two or three years ago,&quot; says David Scherb, director of employee benefits at PepsiCo Inc. in Purchase, N.Y. He cites increased claims for the multiple operations frequently required by premature babies. The procedures increasingly include so-called heroic measures, such as costly organ transplant operations.    OTHER FACTORS: A growing number of state-mandated benefits also are helping push premiums higher, economists say. Forty states, for example, now require underwriters to include coverage for alcohol treatment in their health plans, says Prof. Jensen at the University of Illinois. Big jumps in premiums also can be traced to insurers who failed to increase policy costs adequately in the mid-1980s.    Will more cost sharing solve these problems? Not entirely, some industry professionals say. &quot;It clearly makes sense to have the employee have some stake&quot; in paying for medical care, says William Custer, an economist at the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. But &quot;there are limits to what you can do. By lowering the total compensation to the worker, you're either going to lose good employees or be unable to hire them. Or, if you're dealing with a union, the union isn't going to permit it.&quot;    Still, even small payments out of employees' own pockets can help change attitudes about medical expenses, benefits managers say. At Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. in Toledo, Ohio, many employees now pay an up-front fee of between $5 and $25 when they visit a clinic or hospital. &quot;It's something that makes the employee stop and think: 'Do I need this service?'&quot; says Robert Sears, the company's director of health care management.    ---                    Placing the Blame   Insurance carriers estimate a 21.5% increase in medical-benefit costs next year. They figure that nearly 33% of that increase is due to medical inflation. Cost shifting .................................... 29.5% Utilization ...................................... 16.3% Technology ....................................... 11.2% Catastrophic cases ................................ 8.8% Malpractice ....................................... 1.4% Medical inflation ................................ 32.6%                    Definition of Terms   Medical inflation: Anticipated increases in prices of services covered by typical indemnity plan.   Cost shifting: Shifting of costs by hospitals and doctors to private sector from public sector.   Utilization: Anticipated increases in use of outpatient and inpatient services.   Technology: Additional costs from use of latest and best equipment and technology available.   Catastrophic cases: Increased claims due to transplant operations, AIDS, premature infants, etc.   Malpractice: Reflects increases in malpractice premiums and use of &quot;defensive&quot; medicine.
