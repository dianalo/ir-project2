Lotus has lost market share inthe spreadsheet market in recent years, and its newestspreadsheet, 1-2-3 for Windows, has been widely criticized.   Lotus, which in the past has been tightlipped aboutmarket-share information, said that its market-share lossesin the spreadsheet market haven't been as large as widelyreported. It said that based on industry data from theSoftware Publishers Association, a trade group, it captured63% of spreadsheet revenue in the first three quarters ofthis year.   That would be down narrowly from 65% last year and 70% in1989, but well above the 50% level it captured in the firsthalf of this year. Robert Weiler, senior vice president ofsales and marketing, said the gains reflected a strong thirdquarter in which Lotus sold nearly one million copies of its1-2-3 spreadsheet world-wide.</TEXT></DOC>
