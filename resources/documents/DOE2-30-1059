Early efforts were entitledde minimis and were aimed at establishing a philosophical basis and radiationdose limits. The main objectives of the more recent work on exemptionare (1) to illustrate a method for developing practical radiologicalcriteria, (2) to establish generic criteria, and (3) to determine thepracticability of the preliminary exemption principles. The method usedto develop the criteria relies on models to evaluate the potential radiationexposure pathways and scenarios for individuals and population groupspotentially present following the unrestricted release of materials.This paper describes the assessment methods, presents the generic results(expressed in terms of the limiting concentrations of selected radionuclidesin municipal waste), and provides a comparison with recent regulatoryefforts in the US for considering selected wastes as being Below RegulatoryConcern (BRC). 17 references, 4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
