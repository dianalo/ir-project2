Tom Harkin,D-Iowa, said as the Senate approved the budget late Friday night.``In the way the district spends its own money, the Congress neednot be intervening.''   The bill was sent to President Reagan for his signature lessthan an hour before midnight, when the new fiscal year began.   In approving the city's $3.2 billion fiscal year 1989 budget,the House and Senate added an amendment that would freeze the $537million federal payment for the District's budget and prevent thecity from spending its own money if Medicaid-funded abortions areperformed on women whose lives are not threatened.   The spending bill also would allow Georgetown University to goback on its agreement to allow gay student associations to meet oncampus and apply for student government funds.   The Roman Catholic school had reached an agreement with the gaygroups in March after the District of Columbia Superior Court andCourt of Appeals upheld a finding by the city's human rights officethat Georgetown was discriminating against gay groups. Georgetownofficials have said that they will not go back on their agreementwith the student groups, regardless of what Congress decided.   Walter Fauntroy, the non-voting Democratic delegate to Congressfrom the District, was angered by the intrusion into local affairsand said he would encourage city officials to disobey theabortion-funding prohibition to trigger a congressionally mandatedshutdown of city government. Such a move would leave Congress withthe responsibility of governing the nation's capital.   ``You will forgive me, having respected you for 18 years, if Isuggest to my mayor and people that work for this (city) governmentthat maybe it's time to end this facade,'' a tearful Fauntroy toldhis House colleagues in a meeting where the final touches were puton the budget. ``If Congress wants to decide every little detail,maybe it's time to do that.''   David Clarke, chairman of the District of Columbia Council,concurred with Fauntroy, saying, ``I believe it is time for thepeople of the District of Columbia to take to the streets to defendtheir constitutional rights.''   The abortion measure, offered by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.,toughens current legislation, which allows the city to use locallygenerated funds for abortions, and restricts federal funds for useby rape and incest victims, women suffering through ectopicpregnancies, or when the mother's life is threatened.</TEXT></DOC>
