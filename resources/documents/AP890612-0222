A 60-year anniversary _ he started hoofing onstage at the age of3 _ is cause for retrospection, and Davis was in a reflective mood.He also has a new autobiography, ``Why Me?'' (Farrar, Straus,Giroux, $18.95), an update of his 1965 memoir, ``Yes, I Can.'' Hetalked openly about his years of excess as he sat at the bar of hisHolmby Hills home. Uncharacteristically, he was nursing a soft drink.   ``I created my own monster,'' he said. ``Nobody put a gun to myhead and said, `You have to go over the top.' So I had to deal withit. Once I had created this thing, I didn't like who I was.   ``I didn't realize it at the time, and it took a bunch of yearsof self-analysis. I've never gone to a shrink _ I'm not proud ofthat statement. But there were no places for me to go, there was noBetty Ford's or this or that. I had to do it myself.   ``I miss booze,'' he admitted. ``There ain't no sense of melying. Bourbon and Coke _ oh, man, please! A bloody Mary on theplane, that was it! I would get on the plane and before it took offI had two bloody Marys. Or two salty dogs. Man, I'm ready. It cancrash now, I don't care.   ``I always had to have the sip before I walked on the stage. Thatwas my reinforcement. I used to watch the guys go to the bathroom,not knowing they were going for a hit. I never did that. I'd justsay, `Bartender, may I have some more of this?'''   Davis quit drinking a dozen years ago because of cirrhosis of theliver. He told of sitting on a hospital bed while his doctorprepared to drain his bloated belly. ``If it comes out cloudy,that's it: The bell's rung,'' said the doctor. He watchedbreathlessly and saw that the fluid was _ clear.   But by the time he kicked the booze, his career was on the skids.``I had messed up so much in Vegas and Tahoe and other places thatit was hard to get the bookings,'' he recalled.   His salary was cut because of his unreliability. ``I'd get on thestage and I didn't know whether I did 40 minutes or an hour and 40.''   After the boozing stopped, he played the Las Vegas Desert Inn forfour weeks with a full orchestra. The trade realized that SammyDavis Jr. was back.   His career may have been repaired, but his finances were not. Oneday Internal Revenue Service agents arrived at the Davis house toannounce that it was being placed on lien. His income tax billamounted to $2 million. His friends offered to help; Frank Sinatrawas ready to write a check. So was casino owner Bill Harrah.   ``No,'' said Davis. ``Thank you very much, but I got to get outof it.'' He reached a longterm agreement to repay the governmentfrom his earnings.   ``Why Me?'' tells the whole story: the constant touring as a kidwith his father and Will Mastin; the endless racial taunts;membership in Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack; the violent reactions to hisromance with Kim Novak and his marriage to May Britt; the 1954 carcrash that cost him an eye; the connections with the Kennedys,Richard Nixon and Martin Luther King; the enduring marriage to histhird wife, Altovise.   Davis seems to remember everything, but of his show businessbeginning 60 years ago, he is uncertain: ``It gets confusing. Idon't know what they've told me about and what the reality is.   ``I do remember wearing long pants. I couldn't have been morethan 4 or 5. My dad and Will Mastin passed me off as a 44-year-oldmidget. I had a rubber cigar in my mouth and they would treat melike an adult. That was the only way we could get around the childlabor laws. There was something called the Gerry Society that wasstrict on kids working.   ``It worked for a couple of years until they got wise to us. Dadand Will got busted when we were playing a burlesque house on 42ndStreet. Burlesque in those days was the poor man's Ziegfeld.''   The major regret of his childhood was missing an eduation.   ``I didn't have one day of formal education,'' said Davis. ``Inever sat in a classroom in my life. That's the one strict thing Ihave with my kids: Get an education. Most of them went to juniorcollege, but at least they went. My daughter, Tracy, went to threejunior colleges; she's a professional go-to-schooler.''   At 63, Davis is riding high. Earlier this year he made his firstscreen appearance in a long time, drawing good reviews in ``Tap''with Gregory Hines. He recently returned from a five-week sold-outtour of Europe with Sinatra and Liza Minnelli. He mused about howwell behaved the three of them were:   ``The only thing that upset the tour was Liza and her dog. (Shehas been fined $2,000 for bringing her dog into Sweden illegally.)We were all having dinner one night, and I said to Liza, `Now canyou imagine the three of us 15 years ago? They wouldn't havementioned the dog. We would have created so much tumult that the dogwould have been 27th on the list!'''   In ``Tap'' and on the tour, Davis danced with his oldtime vigor,an amazing feat for a man who underwent hip reconstruction 18 monthsago.   All those years of pounding stage floors caught up with him inhis late 50s. Unable to withstand the pain, he underwent a ``patchjob'' to reconstruct the hip in 1985. He resumed performing, but thepain returned. In January 1988 he returned to Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter for an operation that replaced the femur with a prosthesisand rebuilt the hip socket.   ``I was off for 10 weeks,'' he said. ``I stayed in the hospitalan extra nine days because I wanted to be ambulatory when I camehome. I went from a walker to crutches to a cane. I had therapy,which is the key to recovery. It started the day after the operation.   ``Now I'm back and dancing. I can't dance the way I once did. ButI don't think any cat can do anything the way he used to do at 20.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, June 23-25</NOTE></DOC>
