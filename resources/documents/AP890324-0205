Among the most frequently cited examples:   _ Some chains encourage doctors to routinely perform simplediagnostic tests, such as strep screens on all people with sorethroats, when there is little indication patients have diseases theyare being tested for. The tests typically cost about $20.   _ Chest X-rays to check for pneumonia are routinely given topeople with coughs and bronchitis, even though most have simplecolds. Costs vary across the country but are often in the $50 range.   _ Many chains give doctors bonuses for amassing big patientbills. One doctor said his chain gave physicians 40 percent of everybill that went over $60.   _ Doctors are often encouraged to prescribe antibiotics topatients who don't need them, so customers will feel they havegotten their money's worth. When the clinics sell the drugs theyalso prescribe, this of course further raises profits. At onewalk-in chain, one of every four patients bought medicines and paidan average of $8.60 per prescription.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 2</NOTE></DOC>
