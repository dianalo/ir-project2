 Andthe market's middlemen aren't content to just sit back quietly licking theirwounds.andM;Publicly, executives for the leading distributors express concern thatcost-plus franchisors such as Intelligent Electronics and MicroAge areincreasingly invading their turf.andP;  Privately, they acknowledge they have hadpreliminary talks with the Big Three hardware makers -- IBM, Apple and Compaq-- aimed at persuading them to take their products through traditionaltwo-step distribution.andM;And the outcome of those discussions holds enormous implications for thechannel and customers.andM;Abandoning a royalty-based approach has paid big dividends for MicroAge.andP;  Atthe end of fiscal 1989 last September, the chain boasted a network of 362stores.andM;By the end of the March quarter, the Tempe, Ariz., company was servicing morethan 660 locations.andM;Only about a third of that base is core franchisees, buying the bulk of theirproduct from MicroAge corporate and bearing the company's nameplate.andP;  Thebalance uses MicroAge as a distributor under the Apple Affiliates and IBMIndustry Remarketers programs.andP;  And all stores now pay additional fees forany value-added services they pick up from corporate.andM;A recent Smith Barney report estimated that the sites added by MicroAge thisyear will generate some $200 million in revenues, or a brawny 80 percent ofthe totel sales gain projected by the Wall Street firm.andM;A Bear, Stearns analysis suggested that the Apple Affiliates program alonecontributed nearly a quarter of MicroAge's revenue during the first threemonths of fiscal 1990.andM;Companies such as Ingram Micro D and Softsel/Microamerica would like to sharein the windfall by distributing hardware from the Big Three.andM;Since the vendors now overlook their onetime requirement that stores buyingthrough a franchisor bear the headquarter's name, and the fact that cost-plusfranchisors have even less control than they once did over the look andapproach of affiliates, there's even less justification for blockingdistributors.andM;Ingram Micro D and Softsel/Microamerica are primarly worried that franchisorsare selling non-franchised affiliates' products other than Apple and IBMhardware.andP;  That, of course, is the distributors' bailiwick.andM;And these $2 billion companies bring considerable benefits to the table.andM;As JoeAnn Stahel, president of market-research firm StoreBoard, notedrecently, manufacturers gain tremendous cost efficiencies by mass-shipping toa centralized location.andM;Distributors also assume total credit risk, another significant benefit forthe vendor.andM;A decision by the Big Three to push their products through the distributorchannel would pose a serious challenge to the fast-track growth of thecost-plus franchisors.andM;Few would argue that these resellers can compete with the distributor's corebusiness -- distribution.andM;And in many instances, distributors are already benefiting dealers andstreamlining the delivery process.andP;  Customers often receive a product sold bya reseller directly from the distributor for installation by the dealer or byinternal personnel.andM;The move would also make hardware more attractive to service-intensive,non-price and delivery-oriented resellers.andM;Consider Softmart.andP;  Already authorized to sell IBM hardware as a Token-Ringinstaller, the company simply chooses not to because of low margins and highinventory costs.andM;With a distributor bearing the inventory expenses, Softmart could sell thetotal solution, including software, hardware, installation and integration.andM;That would simplify life considerably for customers who, today, mustnegotiate separate agreements for the hardware and software.andM;And when you cut through all the fog, that's what distribution efficiency isall about.andM;Not achieving buying discounts by purchasing through a cost-plus franchisor,but speeding the solution to the customer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
