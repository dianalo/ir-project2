The Democratic presidential candidate urged the captors to``create a breakthrough of better understanding'' and join all theworld's people in rebuilding Lebanon, which has been ravaged by war.   ``One of the tragedies of your long war had been the kidnappingand disappearance of thousand of Lebanese,'' Jackson said in anaudio and video message. ``My heart goes out to these victims ofwar and their families. There are also American and Europeanvictims: Terry Anderson, Terry Waite and others are now the prisonsof a war that they did not start and cannot end.   ``But their captivity has reminded us that none of us is freeuntil all of us are free. I appeal to you from the depths of myheart and soul to let them go. Their release could create abreakthrough of better understanding,'' he said.
