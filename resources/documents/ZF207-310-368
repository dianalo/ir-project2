 On the onehand, many believe that new plants and increased use of automation andinformation systems are the only ways manufacturers can remain competitive ina worldwide market.andP;  They feel that far too much effort is spent onjustifying CIM--effort that would be better spent actually implementing it.andO;CIM's payback, this group contends, is over the long term and cannot bemeasured with normal economic models.andP;  On the other side of the debate,others, while agreeing that CIM can provide manufacturers with thecompetitive spark, insist that cost justification fuels that spark.andM;In order to gather such cost-justification data, you should consider severalfactors.andP;  First, the total cost of a CIM investment, including the cost tomaintain and operate a new CIM program, can be measured and evaluated as abusiness case.andP;  So can the benefits.andP;  But, to do so, users need to adopt adifferent outlook, applying traditional economic tools in ways that they maynot be accustomed to.andM;A financially sound business case for CIM in your company should detail theexpected success of the project.andP;  It should also outline a plan specifyinghow to validate that success before the project is actually implemented.andO;This gives the scheme credibility with your management and provides theimplementation team with a much better understanding of refinements andmodifications for the next CIM launch.andM;You should avoid the single champion approach to CIM.andP;  This champion oftenrelies on faith as the only justification for investments in hardware andsoftware.andP;  Although there are examples of CIM projects that have beensuccessfully implemented on faith alone, they usually are the result of thechampion's determination and ability to stay with the undertaking all the waythrough to the end.andP;  In today's volatile and merger-driven businessenvironment, reliance on a single person may well lead to disaster.andM;In ordr to cost justify CIM projects, many managers fall back on factorycost-accounting techniques that have been used by manufacturing firms formore than 30 years.andP;  Over the last three decades, these systems havemetamorphosed into rather complicated automated systems designed to reportthe financial status of a company.andP;  In most cases, these systems are notintended to provide detailed cost data at the component level for decisionmaking.andP;  Members of both academia and business point out that newcost-accounting practices are needed to help manufacturing companies moreaccurately determine product cost.andM;While it would be a good idea to redesign your cost systems so that theybetter reflect product cost, this is not always possible.andP;  Nevertheless,there are still things you can do to achieve the same end.andP;  Start by makingthe best possible estimate of the actual resources consumed in the productionprocess.andP;  If indirect resources, like product engineering or materialmanagement, are a significant element of the product cost, include them asdirect estimates of that cost.andP;  This method is frequently referred to as&quot;direct costing.&quot;andM;One manufacturing company that put this approach to work found it paid off.andO;Reviewing the product cost of a particular component, the company observedthat inbound transportation and product handling seemed to be more expensivethan the estimated labor and material needed to produce the component.andP;  Usingthe direct-costing method to derive an estimate, the manufacturer concludedthat it could produce the component in house by adding processing equipmentthat had the appropriate degree of automation.andP;  By coupling the process withthe assembly line, it was able to eliminate the pricey inbound freight,simplify material handling and minimize inventory costs.andM;Keep in mind that your estimate does not have to look like other factory-costdocuments produced by the cost system.andP;  But it does need to identify allapplicable costs in a clear manner that will be easy to present to managementfor their approval.andP;  Once you have identified these costs, the implementationteam can then pinpoint CIM benefits.andM;When embarking upon a CIM cost-justification effort, view CIM for what itis--a collection of tools and techniques that together can reduce cost,improve quality and compress time.andP;  If your company focuses only on directlabor as the raison d'etre for CIM, you will certainly overlook otheropportunities for major savings.andP;  This will end up making it very difficultto justify CIM programs.andM;Direct labor as a percentage of total product cost has been shrinking overthe last 15 years.andP;  Inventory, engineering and transportation are much moreproductive candidates for big cost savings.andP;  In addition, costs and benefitsnormally considered to be intangibles, such as quality and market share,should also be converted to cash flow and incorporated into your CIMcost-justification exercise.andP;  Improved process controls and data analysisthrough on-line data collection are but a few examples of how technology canimprove product quality.andM;In many cases, it's a good investment of time to have representatives fromyour sales marketing and other relevant divisions document what they sees asthe expected benefits and cash-flow improvements from CIM.andP;  In this way, yougain CIM support outside manufacturing and engineering circles.andP;  Themeasurement steps just described should enable your company to generate moreaccurate business cases that justify a CIM project.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
