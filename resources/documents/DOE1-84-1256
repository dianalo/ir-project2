Its depthU/sub V/(E) and radius R/sub V/(E) are extrapolated from positive tonegative energy by using a previously developed iteration procedure basedon the dispersion relation which connects the real and imaginary partsof the mean field. It is shown that these extrapolated values are quitestable with respect to changes of the main input of the calculation,namely a set of empirical optical-model potentials. Near the Fermi energythe potential radius R/sub V/(E) has a characteristic energy dependence.The calculated potential V(r; E) is the sum of a Hartree-Fock type contributionV/sub HF/(r; E) and of a dispersive contribution {Delta}V(r; E) whichis due to excitations of the /sup 208/Pb core. If V/sub HF/(r; E) isassumed to have a Woods-Saxon shape, {Delta}V(r; E) is found to be surfacepeaked, even at energies as large as 30 MeV at which in the case of neutrons{Delta}V(r; E) has a Woods-Saxon shape. The energy dependence of V(r;E) is characterized by the effective mass m/sup */(r; E), whose dependenceupon r and E is calculated. The spectroscopic factors of single-particleexcitations in /sup 207/Tl and /sup 209/Bi are calculated from the ratiobetween m/sup */ and its Hartree-Fock type approximation. (orig./HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
