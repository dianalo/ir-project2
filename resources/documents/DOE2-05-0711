Someof the findings of an investigation into knock-free performance of ahydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine with the addition of a diluent-carbondioxide are presented. The effects of carbon dioxide on the suppressionof knocking in the hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine and on the improvementin the knock limited power output are described.</TEXT></DOC>
