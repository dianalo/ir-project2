JOFFEE EARNED BIG FEES and great satisfactiongiving legal advice to Time Inc. on its purchase of WarnerCommunications Inc. last year. He found his reward, however,fighting building permit battles and small-claims contractdisputes for no fee at all.   Mr. Joffee, a 47-year-old partner in the prestigious NewYork law firm of Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, is also an activeboard member of the Jericho Project, a nonprofit organizationdedicated to helping homeless people recovering from alcoholor drug abuse find shelter and jobs. Started seven years agoas an outreach program of three Episcopal churches, Jerichotoday operates on an $800,000 annual budget, providing jobcounseling and subsidized rent for 59 people in a scruffyManhattan welfare hotel.   Lawyer Joffee joined the group in 1985, attracted by itsefforts to rehabilitate instead of simply house those withsubstance-abuse problems. His firm, like many others,encourages pro bono, or free, work by members on behalf ofthose who can't afford legal services. But the Harvard Lawgraduate has gone the extra mile, giving about 20% of hisprofessional time to Jericho and other causes. Hiscontribution to Jericho alone could equal about $28,000 ayear in legal fees, based on what partners in firms ofCravath's stature command from corporate clients.   &quot;Even though Bob's own workday is full, he has time forus,&quot; says Gene Estess, Jericho's executive director and aformer Wall Street options trader. If Mr. Joffee is away,Jericho staffers simply leave a message on his answeringmachine. &quot;We couldn't operate without him and we couldn'tafford to pay for his legal and business advice,&quot; says Mr.Estess.   Even during last year's lengthy high-pressure tangle ofnegotiations and court battles -- as Time fought a hostilebidder and completed the $14 billion acquisition of WarnerCommunications -- Mr. Joffee had time for Jericho. However,he concedes he briefly had to delegate some of the Jerichoload to two associates. &quot;I don't think we let anything fallbetween the cracks at Jericho,&quot; he says.   Mr. Joffee's major Jericho challenge since late 1988 hasinvolved plans to convert a five-story former Harlem hotelinto a permanent Jericho residence for 56 people. He handleda legal dispute with the first architect over paymentschedules and oversaw the yearlong eviction proceedings of aliquor store from the old structure.   He has also dealt with about six state and city agenciesto complete the facility, with occupancy now scheduled forOctober. (Even with the resources, skills and perseverance ofan advocate like Mr. Joffee, the project fell eight monthsbehind schedule, snarled in red tape that he had to unravel.)   His current legal work for the group is hardly materialfor an &quot;L.A. Law&quot; script. For instance, he is working on aconduct code to spell out how both employees and residents atthe new facility can be lawfully tested, on a regular basis,for use of drugs and alcohol without violating their privacy.In addition, he is studying such weighty matters as Jericho'sliability for, say, lost or scorched clothing should Jerichoopen a laundromat business on the ground floor of the rebuiltHarlem structure.   Mr. Joffee is also continuing to search for new Jerichoboard members. Over a business lunch, he recently convinced afellow corporate lawyer to sign on; at a cocktail party/fundraiser for Jericho at his apartment he persuaded a successfulpsychiatrist, who has an apartment in the same building, tobecome a board member.   &quot;Helping those less lucky than myself is very satisfying,&quot;says Mr. Joffee. &quot;In some way it pays back for the luck I'vehad in my life.&quot; Students in his high school must have sensedsomething: The class of '61 voted him most likely to succeed.</TEXT></DOC>
