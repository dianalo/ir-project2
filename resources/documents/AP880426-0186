A bipartisan group of 187 House members has written Secretary ofState George P. Shultz opposing the sale of advanced U.S. equipmentin light of the Saudis' recent secret purchase of missiles fromChina that could devastate Israel. In the Senate, 58 members are onrecord against the deal.   But State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the Saudishad given assurances the missiles would not be nuclear-armed andhad decided to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty.   Under the accord, states without nuclear weapons agree not tomake or acquire them.   ``We have not changed our view that the AWACS maintenancepackage is critical to our gulf policy,'' Redman told reporters.``The Saudi AWACS operation provides important support for the U.S.mission in the gulf, including protection of U.S. Navy personneland equipment.''   American warships are protecting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oiltankers in the war between Iran and Iraq. A number of clashes withIran resulted above the Strait of Hormuz, through which cargoespass.   The area is patrolled by U.S. radar planes, with the Saudi AWACS_ or Airborne Warning and Control System _ aircraft confined to thesouthern region, State Department officials told members ofCongress last week in a secret briefing.   In the south, U.S. forces are under threat of Silkworm anti-shipmissiles Iran purchased from China.   The decision to sell new equipment to the Saudis sets the stagefor a debate May 9, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee isdue to hold a hearing on the nomination of Walter Cutler to beambassador to Saudi Arabia.   The missiles China sold to the Saudis are capable of carryingnuclear or chemical warheads and have a range of about 1,600 miles.They add to Israel's security concerns that were heightened lastyear when Syria obtained missiles from the Soviet Union that alsocould rocket Israeli population centers with deadly chemicalweapons.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said 186 other House members hadsigned a letter he wrote urging Shultz to withdraw the proposedsale.   Redman said Shultz had not replied yet. But, the spokesman said,``we expect to go forward with the formal notification in the nearterm.''   When that step is taken, the deal will go through unless boththe House and Senate vote to reject it within 30 days.   ``The Saudis have assured us that their missiles would not benuclear-capable,'' Redman said. ``By adhering to the NPT (NuclearNonproliferation Treaty), Saudi Arabia would further obligateitself not to develop or acquire nuclear devices.''   The spokesman said the State Department was concerned about theproliferation of missiles throughout the Middle East and PersianGulf _ not just with the Saudi purchase from China.   ``We remain fully committed to providing the necessary supportto Saudi Arabia for the continued operation of the AWACS,'' Redmansaid. ``It is in the national security interest of the UnitedStates to conclude this deal.''   Schumer said signing the nonproliferation treaty ``is certainlya welcome move.'' But, he said, ``it does not diminishcongressional concerns.''   The New York congressman said ``the Chinese missiles, evenwithout nuclear warheads, pose a real threat to the security of theentire region, in part because they are easily equipped withchemical warheads.''   He added: ``The fact that the missiles were acquired under acloud of deceit only heightens our concern.''   Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was expected to announce a break indiplomatic relations with Iran in response to Iranian attacks onshipping in the gulf   According to an informed source, who requested anonymity, theSaudi council of ministers took the decision at a meeting Mondaynight.   Saudi Arabia, like most of the Arab countries, supports Iraq inits war with Iran.   The United States, already protecting 11 Kuwaiti oil tankersflying the U.S. flag, may extend the protection to neutral shipping.   Shultz confirmed Monday at a news conference in Brussels that adecision was under consideration. He and Redman declined to saywhether the request for broader U.S. involvement in the tanker warhad come from the Saudis.</TEXT></DOC>
