Fadlallah, who advises the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, spoke at theBir el-Abed mosque in the Shiite Moslem slums of south Beirutduring Ashoura ceremonies commemorating the most revered Shiitesaint, Imam Hussein bin Ali, grandson of the prophet Mohammed.   Shiites held Ashoura parades Friday, trampling Israeli andAmerican flags inscribed ``Death to Israel, Death to America.''   Eight Americans and eight other Western hostages are held inLebanon, most of them by radical Shiite groups believed associatedwith Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God.   Fadlallah's statement seemed to corroborate an offer madeearlier this month by the captors of Joseph Cicippio after theysuspended plans to kill the American hostage.   They said they would free Cicippio if Israel released 450 Arabprisoners and allowed 55 Palestinian deportees to return to theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israel has offered to exchange Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aHezbollah-affiliated cleric kidnapped July 28 in southern Lebanon,and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three Israelissoldiers held in Lebanon and the Western hostages. Hezbollah hasrefused to negotiate.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater calledFadlallah's comments ``interesting'' and said the Bushadministration hopes ``it signals their desire to release thehostages.''   ``We would like to lower our voices a little and let theseissues play out for a few days and see what happens,'' he said.   Parades marking the Ashoura holiday were held in south Beirutand in towns in eastern and southern Lebanon with predominantlyShiite populations.   The Ashoura holiday commemorates the killing of the saintHussein by Moslem armies after a 10-day siege at Karbala, now partof Iraq. The battle was part of the fight over succession toMohammed that eventually split Islam into Sunni and Shiite branches.   About 10,000 men, women and children participated in southBeirut. Most were dressed in black and beat their heads and chests.   Ahead of the marchers were loudspeaker vans covered with blackcloth and portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranianrevolutionary patriarch who died in June, and his successor, AliKhamenei.</TEXT></DOC>
