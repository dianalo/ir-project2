EPA believes that this substance may be hazardousto human health and that the uses described in this rule may result insignificant human exposure. A requirement to notify EPA at least 90 daysbefore commencing significant new uses will provide EPA with the opportunityto evaluate the intended uses and, if necessary, prohibit or limit thoseactivities before they occur. This rule was proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52443).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Authority</ITAG>Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determinethat a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA mustmake this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors,including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a useof a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) ofTSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days beforethey manufacture, import, or process the substance for that use.Persons subject to this SNUR must comply with the same notice requirementsand EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under section 5(a)(1)(A)of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submissionrequirements of section 5 (b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized bysection 5(h) (1), (2), (3), and (5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action undersection 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities on which it has receiveda SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requiresEPA to explain in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> its reasons for not taking action.Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a final SNUR aresubject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). Theregulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. Personswho intend to import a chemical substance are subject to the TSCA section13 import certification requirements, which are codified at 19 CFR 12.118through 12.127 and 127.28. Persons who import a substance identified ina final SNUR must certify that they are in compliance with the SNUR requirements.The EPA policy in support of the import certification appears at 40 CFRpart 707.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Applicability of General Provisions</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 5, 1984 (49 FR 35011), EPA promulgatedgeneral regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs (40 CFR part 721, subpartA). On July 27, 1988 (53 FR 28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPApromulgated amendments to the general provisions. The general provisionsare discussed in the two documents in detail, and interested persons shouldrefer to those documents for further information. These general provisionsapply to this SNUR, except as discussed in this preamble and as set forthin andSection; 721.557. On August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgatedthe ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use noticesto submit certain fees to EPA are discussed in detail in that <T4>Federal Register</T4> document.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of This Rule</ITAG>The chemical substance which is the subject of this rule is identifiedas mixture of 1,3-benzenediamine, 2(or 4)- methyl-4,6 (or 2,6)-bis (methylthio)-,and is listed as such on the TSCA inventory. It was the subject of PMNP-86-1322. EPA is designating the following activities as significant newuses of the substance: Use other than for industrial uses; any method ofdisposal of the uncured substance other than by incineration; productionat an aggregate volume of the substance greater than that permitted thePMN submitted under the terms of the consent order, without performingthe toxicity testing required in that order; and manufacturing, importing,or processing without establishing a program whereby (1) persons who maybe exposed dermally to the substance wear gloves, eye protection, and protectiveclothing, and persons who may be exposed by inhalation wear a NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health approved, category 19C airsupplied respirator, (2) potentially exposed individuals are informed ofthe possible hazards and required protective equipment, and (3) containersof the substance which may be distributed in commerce are labeled. Thisrule requires persons intending to manufacture, import, or process thesubstance identified in this rule to submit a signficant new use noticeto EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process thatsubstance for the significant new uses described above.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Background Information on P-86-1322</ITAG>On July 18, 1986, EPA received a PMN which EPA designated as P-86-1322.EPA announced receipt of the PMN in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 12, 1986 (51 FR 28875). The PMN submitterinitially claimed the following as confidential business information (CBI):chemical identity, production volume, and process information. The PMNsubmitter withdrew the confidentiality claim for chemical identity whenit submitted a Notice of Commencement of Manufacture under 40 CFR 720.102.For purposes of clarity, the substance will be referred to by its specificname and PMN number. The PMN submitter currently intends to manufacturethe substance for use as a chain extender for polyurethane cast moldedelastomer production, polyurethane reaction injection molding elastomers,polyurethane foams, polyurethane coatings, adhesives, polyurethane sealants,polyurethane/epoxy co-polymers, chemical intermediate, epoxy coating, epoxycomposite matrices, or epoxy tooling resins.The Agency proposed a SNUR for this substance which was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52443). No publiccomments were received by the Agency during the 60-day period followingthe date of publication of the proposed rule. The background of the PMNand the reasons for proposing the SNUR are set forth in the preamble tothe proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Objectives and Rationale for the Rule</ITAG>To determine what would constitute significant new uses of P-86-1322, EPAconsidered relevant information about the toxicity of the substance, likelyexposures associated with possible uses, and the four factors listed insection 5(a)(2) of TSCA. Based on these considerations, EPA wishes to achievethe following objectives with regard to the significant new uses that aredesignated in this rule:1. EPA wants to ensure that it will receive notice of any company's intentto manufacture, import, or process P-86-1322 for a significant new usebefore that activity begins.2. EPA wants to ensure that it will have an opportunity to review and evaluatedata submitted in a significant new use notice before the notice submitterbegins manufacturing, importing, or processing P-86-1322 for the significantnew use.3. EPA wants to ensure that it will be able to regulate prospective manufacturers,importers, or processors of P-86-1322 before significant new use of thatsubstance occurs, provided that the degree of potential health and environmentalrisk is sufficient to warrant such regulation.Given EPA's concerns about P-86-1322, EPA believes that unrestricted manufacture,import, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of thesubstance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. Basedon test data on the structural analogues 2,4-diaminotoluene and 2,6-diaminotoluene,EPA has determined that any significant exposure may present a risk ofcancer and chronic organ and systemic effects to workers.EPA believes that the data described in this preamble and in the preambleto the proposed rule are sufficient to support the conclusion that thesignificant new uses of P-86-1322 present a potentially significant increasein the magnitude of exposure. Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA does not requireEPA to make either a ``may present'' or a ``will present'' risk findingwith regard to satisfying the requirements for a significant new use. Thestatute imposes the requirement that EPA provide for a ``considerationof all relevant factors.'' EPA believes that a reasonable qualitative assessmentof these factors was incorporated in the preamble of the proposed rulepublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52443).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Recordkeeping</ITAG>To ensure compliance with this rule and to assist enforcement efforts,EPA is requiring, under its authority in sections 5 and 8(a) of TSCA, thatin addition to meeting the requirements in andSection; 721.17, the recordsdescribed in andSection; 721.557(b)(2) be maintained for 5 years after thedate of their creation by persons who manufacture, import, or process P-86-1322.These recordkeeping requirements would apply to all manufacturers, importers,and processors, including small manufacturers, importers, and processors,because the small business exemption of section 8(a) of TSCA is not applicablewhen the chemical substance which is the subject of the rule also is thesubject of a section 5(e) order. EPA considered omitting these specificrecordkeeping requirements, but believes compliance monitoring for thisSNUR would be made more difficult without them.<ITAG tagnum="85">VII. Applicability to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of theFinal Rule</ITAG>When determining that a use is a significant ``new'' use, EPA intends thatthe use not be currently ongoing. In this case, P-86-1322 has recentlyundergone premanufacture review. The notice submitter has sent EPA a Noticeof Commencement of Manufacture and the substance was added to the Inventoryon June 22, 1987. The section 5(e) order prohibits the notice submitterfrom undertaking the activities which EPA is designating as significantnew uses. Therefore, EPA concluded that these uses are not presently ongoing.However, since the chemical substance identified in this SNUR has beenadded to the Inventory, it may be manufactured, imported, or processedby other persons for a significant new use as defined in this rule.EPA believes that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best serve by designatinga use as a significant new use if it is not ongoing as of the proposaldate of the SNUR rather than as of the promulgation of the final rule.If uses begun during the proposal period of a SNUR were considered ongoing,any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a proposed significant newuse before the rule became final. This would make it extremely difficultfor EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements.Thus, persons who began commercial manufacture, import, or processing of P-86-1322 for a significant new use between proposal and promulgationof this rule must cease that activity before the effective date of thisrule. To resume their activities, these persons must comply with all applicableSNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, includingall extensions, expires.EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the commercial activities ofpersons who manufacture, import, or process for a proposed significantnew use prior to promulgation of a final SNUR, has promulgated a new andSection;721.45(h) (July 27, 1988, 53 FR 28354) to allow for advance SNUR compliance(i.e., compliance prior to the date of promulgation).<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Determining When Use Is Designated in This Rule</ITAG>EPA has designated a significant new use at production volumes which areconfidential. EPA believes it is appropriate to keep this information confidentialto protect the interest of the original notice submitter.Therefore, EPA will only reveal the production volumes described in andSection;721.557(a)(2)(iv) to a manufacturer or importer who has shown a <T3>bona fide</T3> intent to manufacture or import the substance. To establisha <T3>bona fide</T3> intent, the person must submit the information requiredunder andSection; 721.11. EPA will make a determination as to whether theperson has established a <T3>bona fide</T3> intent to manufacture or import the substance. If theperson has established a <T3>bona fide</T3> intent, EPA will inform the person of the productionvolumes which would constitute a significant new use.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Test Data and Other Information</ITAG>EPA recognizes that, under TSCA section 5, persons are not required todevelop any particular test data before submitting a significant new usenotice. Rather, persons are only required to submit test data in theirpossession or control and to describe any other data known to or reasonablyascertainable by them.However, in view of the potential health risks that may be posed by a significantnew use of this substance, EPA suggests potential SNUR notice submittersconsider conducting tests that would permit a reasoned evaluation of thepotential risks posed by this substance when utilized for an intended use.EPA believes that the results of a 2-year rodent bioassay and a 90-daysubchronic study would adequately characterize possible cancer and chronichealth effects, respectively, of the substance. The TSCA section 5(e) consentorder negotiated with the PMN submitter prohibits the submitter from exceedingspecific production limits without completing these studies. Under theconsent order, the PMN submitter is required to submit each study at least12 weeks before it reaches the respective production volume limits. Theorder contains detailed procedures for dealing with situations where theresulting data are invalid or equivocal, or show that the substance willpresent an unreasonable risk of injury under the exposure limitations inthe order. This SNUR uses the same production volume limits as the consentorder; those production volume limits are defined as a significant newuse.EPA believes it is likely that the PMN submitter will conduct the 2-yearrodent bioassay and 90-day subchronic study before reaching the productionvolume limits and before any other person who would be subject to thisSNUR would reach the limits in the SNUR. Accordingly, before beginningto conduct either study a person subject to this SNUR should contact EPAto determine whether the required study has already been produced. Thesestudies may not be the only means of addressing the potential risks. SNURnotices submitted for significant new uses without such test data may increasethe likelihood that EPA will take action under section 5(e).EPA encourages persons to consult with EPA before selecting a protocolfor testing the substance. As part of this prenotice consultation, EPAwill discuss the test data it believes necessary to evaluate a significantnew use of the substance. Test data should be developed according to TSCAGood Laboratory Practice standards at 40 CFR part 792. Failure to do somay lead EPA to find such data to be insufficient to evaluate reasonablythe health effects of the substance.EPA urges SNUR notice submitters to provide detailed information on humanexposure that will result from the significant new uses. In addition, EPAencourages persons to submit information on potential benefits of the substanceand information on risks posed by the substance compared to risks posedby substitutes.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Economic Analysis</ITAG>EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new usenotice requirements for the manufacture, import, distribution in commerce,use, processing, and/or disposal of this chemical substance. EPA's completeeconomic analysis is available in the public record.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control numberOPTS-50569A). The record includes basic information considered by EPA indeveloping this rule. EPA will supplement the record with additional informationas it is received. The record now includes the following:1. The premanufacture notice.2. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of receipt of the PMN.3. The section 5(e) consent order.4. The proposed SNUR.5. The economic analysis of this rule.6. The toxicology support document.7. The engineering support document.8. The exposure support document.A public version of this record containing sanitized copies from whichCBI has been deleted is available to the public in the TSCA Public DocketOffice from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.The TSCA Public Docket Office is located in Rm. NE-G004, 401 M St., SW.,Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore, requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determinedthat this rule is not a ``major rule'' because it will not have an effecton the economy of $100 million or more and it will not have a significanteffect on competition, costs, or prices. While there is no precise wayto calculate the total annual cost of compliance with this rule, EPA believesthat the cost will be low. EPA believes that, because of the nature ofthe rule and the substance involved, there will be few significant newuse notices submitted. Furthermore, while the expense of a notice and theuncertainty of possible EPA regulation may discourage certain innovation,that impact will be limited because such factors are unlikely to discouragean innovation that has high potential value.This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA has determinedthat this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small businesses. EPA cannot determine whether parties affected by thisrule are likely to be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receivefew SNUR notices for the substance. Therefore, EPA believes that the numberof small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantial evenif all the SNUR notice submitters were small firms.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisrule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012 to thisrule. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 8 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief,Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 721</ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Significant new uses.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
