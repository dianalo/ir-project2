Sheinberg munched melon,berries, and a bran muffin, but he didn't eat any nails.   The MCA Inc. president's reputation for toughness makes the menu worth noting.    &quot;We've had many business arguments over time,&quot; says producer Martin Starger, who has nonetheless remained a close friend. &quot;He's one of the toughest negotiators that one ever wants to sit with.&quot;    Mr. Sheinberg may have to be. It is widely assumed that the lanky, gray-haired, 51-year-old lawyer will eventually succeed MCA's legendary chairman, Lew R. Wasserman. And when that day comes, Mr. Sheinberg will need toughness aplenty if he is faced with fending off corporate raiders and other suitors who may want to take over and possibly dismember his asset-rich company.    Speculators apparently have already moved into the stock, spurred by Mr. Wasserman's June 24 surgery to remove polyps from his colon. Since then MCA shares have soared, rising $4.875 on Friday to close at $62. On June 24 the stock closed at $49.    The thinking is that without Mr. Wasserman, who is 74 years old and controls more than 15% of MCA's shares, the entertainment and real estate concern based in Universal City, Calif., might be a likely takeover target valued at perhaps $70 or $80 a share, analysts say. MCA has roughly 76 million shares outstanding.    Only last week MCA adopted an anti-takeover measure that analysts say was designed mainly to prevent so-called greenmail, in which a company buys back its stock from an unwanted suitor at above-market prices.    &quot;This company has such valuable assets that people will be looking to buy the whole thing and/or break it up,&quot; says Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Group.    Mr. Sheinberg won't answer specific questions about the takeover speculation and stock activity, saying, &quot;My view of long-term strategy is, the first thing you have to do is make sure you're here tomorrow. MCA is a long-term oriented company.&quot;    It is a company run by a pair of lean, strait-laced, iron-willed individualists who by all accounts get along well, perhaps partly because Mr. Sheinberg shares the traits of his longtime mentor.    Besides having a reputation as being hard-boiled, Mr. Sheinberg is also known as a intensely private man who is devoted to his wife, actress Lorraine Gary, and two sons, and is abstemious in his personal habits.    &quot;There aren't that many people who know me,&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;I don't have that many friends.&quot;    Mr. Sheinberg is highly regarded for his keen intellect, yet admits he hasn't time to read books despite his company's success at publishing such works as &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; by Anne Tyler, through its paperback division.    &quot;He's pretty much a workaholic,&quot; says talent agent John Gaines, a longtime friend.    Friends say Mr. Sheinberg likes an occasional practical joke and manages to look rumpled despite his expensive suits, which he can easily afford given his compensation. Last year that included $559,000 in cash plus stock now valued at $7 million, the latter to be vested over several years.    Some in the industry criticize Mr. Sheinberg for meddling too much in MCA's film-production business, and last year Frank Price, who was chairman of MCA's motion picture group, resigned after a series of disagreements that were aggravated by some costly flops.    Although tough-minded, Mr. Sheinberg is regarded as a fair man who keeps his word. He inspires loyalty in friends such as Steven Spielberg, whom Mr. Sheinberg gave his first professional directing job. Mr. Sheinberg himself says he takes pride in never being a bully, and protests that he is a much nicer guy than his repute.    &quot;Lew Wasserman used to be known as the toughest guy in town,&quot; he says. &quot;Through some horrible transformation, Lew has become the kindly fellow and now I'm the toughest guy around.&quot;    But the reputation doesn't entirely displease Mr. Sheinberg, who agrees that &quot;you can't run over me, and you can't overpower me.&quot;    Mr. Starger recalls that, as producer of the Broadway musical &quot;Starlight Express,&quot; he negotiated MCA's investment in the production with Mr. Sheinberg, who put aside their longstanding relationship during the talks.    &quot;The friendship is there,&quot; Mr. Starger says. &quot;But it's forgotten in those meetings.&quot;    Mr. Sheinberg almost spent his career as a professor. A top student at Columbia University's law school, he missed being first in his class by a hair's breadth and became a law professor at University of California at Los Angeles in 1958.    But he says success as an academician in those days would have meant a more peripatetic life for his family, and he wanted to stay in Los Angeles. Capitalizing on a fascination with radio in his youth, Mr. Sheinberg joined the legal department of an MCA unit in 1959, and has been with the company ever since. He became president of MCA in 1973.    MCA has been the subject of takeover rumors for some time. Several times in the past it has discussed possible mergers, most recently with RCA before that company was acquired by General Electric Co. But speculation flared anew after Mr. Wasserman's surgery. Mr. Wasserman was released from the hospital Wednesday, and Mr. Sheinberg says he is recovering nicely.    Mr. Wasserman's connection with MCA goes back even further than Mr. Sheinberg's. Carrying on for the late Jules Stein, who founded the company as a small talent agency, Mr. Wasserman built MCA into a leading movie and television production company that also gets substantial revenue from records, toys, publishing, retailing, broadcasting, and other operations, including its studio tour.    MCA also has valuable land holdings consisting of 420 well-situated acres in Universal City, which is surrounded by Los Angeles, and another 414 acres near Orlando, Fla.    Last year MCA earned $155.2 million, compared with $150 million in 1985, but earnings per share were $2.02 in both years. Revenue rose 16% to $2.44 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
