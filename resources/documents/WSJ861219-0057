The rating concern said it was taking the action because the Washington, D.C.-based telecommunications company's efforts to restructure &quot;produced a degree of financial leverage that is no longer commensurate with its previous ratings.&quot; The downgrading covers MCI subordinated notes, subordinated debentures and convertible subordinated debentures.    MCI has said it plans to take a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of $500 million to $700 million for equipment write-downs and costs associated with laying off 15% of its workers. MCI also plans to buy back as many as 15 million of its 283.2 million common shares outstanding, subject to market conditions.    The cost-cutting moves could &quot;result in an improvement in (MCI's) cost structure,&quot; Moody's said. But the moves &quot;could also result in a degree of financial risk not expected at the higher rating level,&quot; Moody's said. The rating service added that it doesn't expect &quot;any significant reduction in the degree of risk&quot; to occur in the next several years.    William E. Conway Jr., senior vice president and chief financial officer, disagreed with the rating concern and said Moody's has &quot;an unnecessary degree of focus on the balance sheet.&quot; He added: &quot;I continue to believe that the steps we've taken make MCI a stronger company rather than a weaker company.&quot;    Moody's said, however, that MCI's balance sheet isn't its only concern. It also noted that MCI's success has been &quot;tempered&quot; by the strength of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the market leader. &quot;In the past year,&quot; Moody's said, &quot;ATandamp;T has solidified its position as not only the carrier of choice in the long-distance industry, but also, more important, as the carrier of choice to the larger, more sophisticated, profitable accounts.&quot;    Moody's said these factors &quot;limit MCI's ability to make the most cost-efficient revenue gains, and thus slows its effort to reach the critical mass necessary to improve operating margins.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
