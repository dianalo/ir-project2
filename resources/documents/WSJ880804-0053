September delivery copper rose 1.55 cents a pound to 91.25 cents, after dropping to the lowest levels in two months Tuesday.    According to William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York, reports that the Japanese have resumed buying copper in London helped contribute to the price resurgence.    &quot;They may have begun to feel that current price levels are attractive,&quot; said Mr. O'Neill.    The rumors helped offset recent pricedepressing elements such as low seasonal demand for copper and anticipation of supply increases, which have encouraged aggressive technical selling, Mr. O'Neill said.    Fred Demler, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, said there also were reports that the Chinese were buying copper in London.    Mr. Demler said return of the spot position in London to a more normal discount to the three-months position -- in contrast to the premium it had enjoyed as recently as several weeks ago -- indicates a lot of copper moved to London recently.    As a result, Mr. Demler said, U.S. producer inventories of copper have declined. Citing American Bureau of Metal statistics, Mr. Demler noted that producer stocks, after peaking at 77,000 tons in March, were down to 25,000 tons at the end of June.    U.S. copper consumers, he said, have let their copper supplies decline to 52,000 tons June 30, compared with 73,000 tons at the end of March.    &quot;Consumers have become kind of complacent,&quot; Mr. Demler said. &quot;They bought copper when there was panic demand at the end of last year and carried those supplies into March. Since then, the supply situation has improved somewhat, as compared with the year end, and premiums being asked by dealers have also declined, so they've been in no hurry to build up supplies again.&quot;    The Peruvian strike situation has also affected the market, according to analysts. Yesterday, the Tintaya mine in Peru was reported to have declared force majeure, or the inability to make shipments of copper, Elder's Mr. O'Neill said. There was a later report that the force majeure had been rescinded, but that development couldn't be verified, he said.    The Tintaya mine produced about 57,000 tons of copper last year, according to Mr. Demler. Other mines are on strike in Peru, cutting output by about 11% from a year earlier, when they produced 392,000 tons of copper, he said. Peru is the world's sixth-largest copper producer.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The three-day-long price rebound faded amid forecasts for chances of rain today and tomorrow. Corn futures prices were mostly lower and soybean futures prices turned mixed. Freese-Notis Weather Inc., Des Moines, Iowa, is predicting that one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch of rain will fall on portions of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. Significant rainfall could temporarily weaken the recent heat wave, but extremely hot conditions are expected over much of the Midwest next week. After the close of trading yesterday, the National Weather Service's six-to-10 day forecast called for much above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in the three states. Wheat futures prices rose because the Agriculture Department agreed to subsidize the sale of 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to China. In recent weeks, the Agriculture Department is widely believed to have rejected subsidy requests by several nations as part of a campaign to trim its export expenses.    SUGAR: Futures prices continued their volatile swings, falling yesterday to erase Tuesday's gains. The October delivery contract dropped 0.75 cent a pound to 11.51 cents. On Tuesday that contract gained 0.63 cent. An analyst said reports that China had bought sugar in the world market prompted the heavy buying late Tuesday after the market had fallen 1.10 cents in earlier trading. &quot;However, the business failed to be confirmed and prices then plunged again&quot; yesterday, he said. The analyst said the market was now trading on technical signals rather than on fundamentals. &quot;The result has been wild price gyrations, with strong rallies and corrections that are twice as strong,&quot; he said. The market, he noted, has been unable to sustain gains over 12 cents a pound for more than a day. Yesterday, the October contract traded as high as 12.19 cents before falling back.    INTEREST RATES: Debt futures ended little changed from Tuesday's closing levels in thin, uninspired trading. One dealer said nervousness ahead of the refunding announcement that wasn't made until after yesterday's close and the key U.S. employment data, to be released Friday, kept participants from establishing fresh positions. The Treasury said late yesterday that next week it will sell $11 billion of three-year notes and $11 billion of 10-year notes. September U.S. Treasury bond futures yesterday ended 1/8 lower at 87 3/8, having traded between 87 5/32 and 87 11/16. Participants said the lack of fresh news and the summer doldrums also discouraged price action. Meanwhile, the employment data appears to have moved onto center stage, and traders seem content to let interest rate futures fluctuate within this range until that information is released.    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: The mixed performance in the grain markets bouyed cattle futures prices. A drop in grain prices signals lower livestock feeding costs, which would ease pressure on drought-stricken farmers to sell their cattle. Hog futures prices, meanwhile, slumped amid speculation that the heat wave is damping consumer demand for pork. </TEXT></DOC>
