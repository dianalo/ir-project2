In Manila, an attacker hurled a grenade into the city's crowdedmain post office, killing at least one person and injuring 18,police and hospital sources said. It was not immediate known if theattack was related to the coup attempt.   Mrs. Aquino, addressing a rally of more than 100,000 peopleFriday, appealed to Filipinos to unite against those who would``destroy our democracy.''   The rebels, who began the coup bid Dec. 1 with attacks inManila, were taking their last stand at Cebu City, 350 miles southof Manila. About 400 rebels led by Brig. Gen. Jose Commendadorcontrolled the Mactan air base.   Commendador told reporters Saturday, ``Surrender is out of thequestion.'' An aide said Commendador was ``waiting word fromManila,'' but he did not elaborate.   Rebel and loyal troops faced each other at a bridge linkingMactan island to Cebu, the Philippines second major commercialcenter. A 600-member marine battalion was flown to Cebu on Fridayto reinforce loyal units.   The military announced Saturday that three brigadier generalsand at least 12 middle-grade officers would be relieved of theirduties for participating in the uprising.   At least 83 people were killed and more than 580 wounded in theattempted coup. It was the sixth and bloodiest military revoltsince Mrs. Aquino was swept into office in February 1986 by a``people power'' revolution that forced Ferdinand E. Marcos, whohad ruled the Philippines for 20 years, into exile.   In his report on the post office attack, police Lt. Jun Javierof the homicide section said the M-26 fragmentation grenade washurled at an area of the first floor where employees were sellingstamps.   At least 16 injured were taken to the Philippine GeneralHospital and another three to Manila Medical Center. One of themdied, officials said.   Military officials have claimed that the rebels who sought tooust Mrs. Aquino plan an urban terrorism campaign.   Mrs. Aquino told the rally Friday she would not relinquish thepresidency to Vice President Salvador Laurel, who was elected onher ticket but has become a rival. He has suggested they bothresign and call new elections.   ``He cannot wait to be president,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``I willnever give up this position to him.''   She also vowed to investigate whether opposition Sen. Juan PonceEnrile was involved in the revolt.   The rally was at the site where hundreds of thousands ofFilipinos, supporting the civilian-military uprising againstMarcos, filled the streets in 1986 so tanks could not pass.   Friday's crowd was smaller than those in 1986 but appeared to beamong the largest since Mrs. Aquino gained power. Governmentoffices encouraged employees to attend, and participants werebrought by bus from as far away as Angeles, 50 miles to the north.   Mrs. Aquino did not mention complaints by the rebels and othercritics that she has not delivered on promises of social justiceand reform.   She delivered most of the speech in Tagalog, the main Philippinelanguage, using an earthy accent and phrases associated withuneducated Filipinos. Her style recalled the simpicity andfrankness that won millions of Filipinos to her cause in 1986.   Speaking briefly in English, Mrs. Aquino said: ``I want all ofus to unite and to give support to the democratic systems ofgovernment and to go after these people who want to destroy ourdemocracy, who want to destroy our economy, who want to destroy theFilipino people.''   Estimates of the crowd varied widely. Government television said1 million people attended, but reporters put the number at morethan 100,000.   In her remarks about the vice president, Mrs. Aquino said: ``Hekeeps on urging me to resign. What does he think I am, stupid? IfLaurel really loves our country like he always says, then I suggesthe resign so we can use the money from his office.''   The crowd cheered wildly and chanted ``Cory! Cory! Cory!'' whenshe mentioned Laurel and Enrile, whom she fired as defense ministerin November 1986 after a failed coup by his followers.   She said she would appoint a presidential commission todetermine whether Enrile or other opposition figures were involvedin the latest rebellion.   Laurel said in a statement after the speech: ``She has not onlylost control of the nation, she has lost control of herself.President Aquino is herself the principal cause of all six coupsthat have occurred during her term, due to her incompetent, weakand corrupt leadership.''   In Washington, the State Department reiterated U.S. support forMrs. Aquino's government. Spokesman Richard Boucher said thepro-Aquino demonstration was ``one of many signs we have from avariety of people on the political spectrum in the Philippines thatthere is very strong support for democracy and support for thedemocratically elected government, and our support for that, ofcourse, is very firm.''   On Thursday, Laurel predicted attempts to overthrow Mrs. Aquinowould continue until she addressed fundamental problems of povertyand social injustice.   Loyal forces have recaptured most installations seized by therebels, many of whom belonged to elite marine and Scout Rangerunits.   Early Thursday, mutineers ended their takeover of Makati, theManila financial district, after allowing more than 1,800foreigners to be evacuated from hotels and apartments in the area.   On Thursday, the military loaded hundreds of captured onto aprison ship in Manila Bay. Military officials said investigationswould be conducted of those above the rank of captain to determinewhether they would be court-martialed.   They said lower-ranking officers and enlisted men would bereassigned to other units, as has generally been the case afterprevious coup attempts.   Most officers involved in past rebellions have been confined tobarracks. A few have been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison,but remain confined to barracks pending ``reviews'' of theirconvictions.</TEXT></DOC>
