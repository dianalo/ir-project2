The book points out that junkmail has become a colossal environmental problem, fillingdumps with millions of tons of garbage and leveling acres oftrees every year.   But not everybody's copy of the book reads that way. In aspecial printing for members of the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, a leading environmental-action group, the page wasrewritten: &quot;Stop Unwanted Junk Mail.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The accompanying text presents a much milder critique ofjunk mail, pointing out that it can also provide &quot;credibleinformation about important environmental and social issues.&quot;The NRDC rewrote the page because it's a big mailer ofunsolicited material itself.   There, in a nutshell, is a mounting problem forenvironmentalists. Junk mail has indisputably become anenvironmental blight. Last year, Americans received some 63billion pieces of third-class mail and tossed out anestimated 15% of it unopened, according to the U.S. PostalService. Catalogs alone caused the destruction of over 70,000acres of forest, estimated conservatively.   But environmental groups and environmentally orienteddirect marketers are hooked on mail. Like so many mailers,they have become dependent on new technology that lets themcompile mailing lists and pinpoint targets by the millions.And the economics of these operations are inherentlywasteful. In a successful mail campaign, 95% of the lettersgo straight into the garbage.   Environmental groups are only a tiny part of the totaljunk-mail picture. By far, most of the junk mail piling up ingarbage dumps comes from commercial mailers.   Still, environmentalists are feeling particular pressureto respond to the issue and avoid the appearance ofhypocrisy. Some are sending their members apologetic lettersassuring them that they use recycled paper. Environmentalmail-order companies are asking customers how many catalogsthey want each year -- departing from the standard industrypractice of bombarding them with dozens of look-alikecatalogs.   Taking another tack, a few groups are openly defendingjunk mail as an important grass-roots medium.   A recent essay in the Utne Reader magazine by twoGreenpeace USA officers laments the waste of junk mail butsays the home mailbox has become its &quot;sanctuary andlifeline.&quot; &quot;PACS {political-action committees} and`entertainment news' dominate public discourse. . . . Thereis no longer a public square where diverse opinions are airedand tested,&quot; the essay argues. Greenpeace says it will sendout about 33 million pieces of mail this year.   &quot;You can't take an ad on `60 Minutes' to tell about yourlittle magazine,&quot; says Patricia Poore, publisher of Garbage,a New York bimonthly about the environment. Concerned aboutthe junk-mail backlash, she went out of her way in her latestsubscriber pitch to explain how the magazine is trying to cutwaste in its mailings. Among the measures: recycled paper, noenvelopes with plastic windows and no &quot;baubles and trinkets.&quot;   Many junk-mailing environmentalists say the alternativesare equally problematic. &quot;You waste more paper with an ad ina mass-market newspaper,&quot; says Celia Tennenbaum, the NationalAudubon Society's membership-promotion director.   &quot;Telemarketing is more environmentally benign, but thepublic doesn't like it, so you can't use it too much,&quot; saysLinda Lopez, director of membership at the Natural ResourcesDefense Council. She adds: &quot;We don't consider the mail wesend junk mail.&quot;   Unfortunately, it's expensive to be an environmentallysensitive mailer. Recycled paper generally costs 5% to 10%extra. Many nonprofit groups can't afford the technology thatsifts out duplicate names on a mailing list -- and thus theywaste reams of paper with every mailing.   &quot;Our board isn't always willing to pour in money {itconsiders} administrative, and computers come under thatheading,&quot; says Lynn Bowersox, a spokeswoman for the NationalWildlife Federation. The federation is mailing some 60million pieces this year, half of it unsolicited. The groupfinally is investing in mailing-list technology and expectsthe new system will cut a quarter of all its mailsolicitations.   Environmental-catalog companies are also trying to cleanup their junk mail.   Gardener's Supply Co. of Burlington, Vt., last year set upa program to recycle glossy catalog paper, which manyrecyclers won't accept. The company says it has taken inabout 400 tons and is currently recycling more paper than ituses in its own catalogs.   Smith andamp; Hawken Ltd., a gardening-supply catalog thataggressively markets its pro-environment stance, recentlyunveiled a nine-point &quot;Junk Mail Initiative.&quot; The MillValley, Calif., company promises to plant two trees for eachone it uses and offers a $5 gift certificate to customers whosend in duplicate mailing labels.   Its chairman, Paul Hawken, railed against nonprofit junkmail in a recent Whole Earth Review article entitled &quot;TheJunk Stops Here.&quot; &quot;It doesn't matter how `beautiful' thecatalog, how `important' the cause, how many people have beentortured in Iran or the number of panda bears that remain inSouthern China,&quot; he wrote in the magazine. &quot;If you don't wantit, it's junk.&quot;   Nevertheless, both Gardener's Supply and Smith andamp; Hawken --and virtually all other environmental mailers -- help clogmailboxes by selling their names to other mailers. The tradein nonprofit names supports an elaborate structure ofconsultants, ad agencies and list brokers.   Some ads for environmental groups' mailing lists mightsurprise their own members. For example, the NationalWildlife Federation runs large ads calling its mailing list&quot;ideal for reaching responsive, upscale individuals with asocial conscience.&quot;   &quot;Here's an affluent, upscale audience it will really payyou to reach,&quot; trumpets a trade ad for the National AudubonSociety list. &quot;Plus, 33% maintain liquid assets of over$75,000]&quot; It calls the list &quot;reliably responsive for qualityoffers such as publishing . . . fashions . . . gift catalogs. . . upscale general merchandise.&quot;   Many groups don't disclose the fact that they sell theirlists. Some offer members a box to check if they don't wanttheir name sold. But junk-mail critics think the environmentand personal privacy would be better served if the systemwere reversed and the box said: &quot;Check here if you DO wantyour name sold.&quot;   The National Wildlife Federation's Ms. Bowersox, likeothers who make money from their lists, says the practicehelps raise extra funds for environmental work. Says theAudubon Society's Ms. Tennenbaum about list selling: &quot;We'vebeen doing this for years, and we don't get complaints.&quot;   A rare group organization that doesn't sell its list isthe EarthWorks Group, publisher of the &quot;50 Simple Things&quot;series of environmental books.   &quot;Direct mail is not the biggest problem in America -- theozone layer is disappearing, and the air is unbreathable inmost cities,&quot; says John Javna, the group's founder. &quot;But ifthere's no recourse for something as direct and irritating as{junk mail}, how are we ever going to solve the largerproblems?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
