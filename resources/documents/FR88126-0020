Thestandards, policies, standard specifications, guides, and references (publications)that are approved by the FHWA for application on all Federal-aid highwayprojects are listed in 23 CFR Part 625. The standards, policies, and referencesfor pavement design are contained in Part 626 and are generally cited inandSection; 625.4(a)(11). Part 626 currently approves and incorporates byreference the publication entitled the ``American Association of StateHighway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Interim Guide for Designof Pavement Structures, 1972,'' Chapter III Revised 1981 for applicationon Federal-aid projects. On May 7, 1986 (51 FR 16830), the list of publicationscontained in Part 625 was revised and updated. In order to accurately reflecta publication list which differentiates between publications establishingFederal standards and publications containing guidance and informationmaterials, a new section entitled ``Guide and references'' was added toPart 625. For those publications that provide informational and guidancematerial only, the incorporation by reference was withdrawn and the publicationcitation was placed in the new guide and reference section. By the May7, 1986, final rule, an additional publication entitled ``Guidelines onPavement Management, AASHTO 1985'' (Management Guide) was added as a referenceat andSection; 625.5(a)(7). To be consistent with the May 7, 1986, policyon reference citations, the FHWA proposes to add the 1986 publication entitled``AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures'' (1986 Guide) to andSection;625.5, ``Guides and references.'' The AASHTO views the Management Guideand the 1986 Guide as informational and guidance materials and not as technicalpolicies and standards. The FHWA shares this view and proposes to revisePart 626.The primary reasons for development of the 1986 Guide by AASHTO include:To incorporate the latest available research findings on design concepts;to include the latest design methods for pavement rehabilitation; and toprovide a more definitive and complete document on pavement design. The1986 Guide presents a wide range of pavement design principles and methodologiesand addresses the many geographical, environmental, and climatic factorswhich influence the preparation of pavement designs. In addition, the 1986Guide includes the latest technical data on pavement factors such as reliability,soil support/erosion, drainage, layer coefficients, traffic volume, etc.Because of the number of regional and technical factors that are necessarilyinvolved in the preparation and selection of particular pavement designs,the design engineers are provided sufficient flexibility in determiningwhen and to what extent each of the factors is to be used. This flexibilityallows the design engineer to consider design criteria within the contextof local or regional needs, conditions, and past pavement performance.The selection of a particular pavement design is intended to provide apavement that adequately meets the existing and probable traffic needsand withstands environmental conditions in a manner conducive to highwaysafety. The design principles and methodologies contained in the ManagementGuide and the 1986 Guide provide a framework of design parameters whichcan be organized into a system approach to obtain consistent and rationaldesign recommendations. The FHWA's existing policy states that pavement design may be based onother procedures and practices of individual agencies that by past performancehave proved to be satisfactory for the relative conditions. Since the ManagementGuide and the 1986 Guide are proposed to be cited as guidance and informationalmaterial, they will only be used as references for evaluating the adequacyof the pavement design. In order to assure that appropriate standards andprocedures are utilized by the States to protect the Federal investmentin safety and cost-effective pavement life cycles, the FHWA is proposingto revise existing policy. The FHWA is also proposing to require that Statehighway agencies (SHA's) establish a pavement management system (PMS) whichincludes the selection and design of new pavement structures and rehabilitationstrategies. The SHA's would have the flexibility to establish a PMS toinclude methodologies and procedures recognizing the need for local variationsby providing ranges of acceptable values and alternative procedures foruse under varying conditions. The FHWA believes that sufficient guidance and reference material are availableupon which a PMS can be established by the SHA's without undue burdensbeing placed on the State's resources. The SHA's will be able to take advantageof available expertise contained in the Management Guide, the 1986 Guide,other appropriate design guides, and performance experience in the State.It is the intention of the FHWA that if this proposed policy is implemented,the pavement needs of the individual States can be met while maintainingconsistency within geographical areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>This analysis discusses the proposed revisions to 23 CFR Part 626. Section 626.1 <T3>Purpose. </T3>The proposed revision of this section adds the program elements of pavementmanagement and federal-aid funding eligibility to the pavement design purposestatement. Section 626.3 <T3>Definitions. </T3>The current definitions for ``Stage construction'' and ``Ultimate structuraldesign'' would be deleted as unnecessary. Definitions for ``Analysis Period'',``Life Cycle Cost'', ``Low Volume Road'', ``Pavement Design'', ``PavementMaintenance'', ``Pavement Management'', ``Pavement Performance Period'',``Pavement Reconstruction'', ``Pavement Rehabilitation'' and ``PavementStructure'' would be added to define elements of the Pavement Policy. ``Analysis Period'' would be the period of time over which life cycle costsare assessed in the study of pavement design alternatives. ``Life Cycle Cost'' would be all ownership and user costs necessary toprovide a serviceable pavement over the analysis period. These includeconstruction, maintenance, rehabilitation, traffic disruption costs, andsalvage value, etc. ``Low-Volume Road'' would be a road where the structural design is basedon less than 1,000,000 18-Kip Equivalent Single Axle Loads (ESAL's). ``Pavement Design'' would be that portion of the pavement management systemwhich determines the material properties and the load carrying capacityof the pavement structure. ``Pavement Maintenance'' would be the preservation of the pavement structure,including joints, drainage, surface, and shoulders, as necessary for itssafe and efficient utilization. ``Pavement Management'' would encompass all the activities involved inthe planning, design, construction, maintenance, evaluation, and rehabilitationof pavements. A pavement management system (PMS) is a set of tools or methodsthat assist decision-makers in finding optimum strategies for providing,evaluating and maintaining pavements in a serviceable condition. ``Pavement Performance Period'' would be the period of time that a newlyconstructed, rehabilitated or reconstructed pavement will perform beforereaching its terminal serviceability. Also referred to as service life.``Pavement Reconstruction'' would be construction of the equivalent ofa new pavement structure which usually involves complete removal and replacementof the existing pavement structure including new and/or recycled materials.``Pavement Rehabilitation'' would be Resurfacing, Restoration, and Rehabilitation(3R) work undertaken to restore serviceability and to extend the servicelife of an existing facility. This may include partial recycling of theexisting pavement, placement of additional surface materials or other worknecessary to return an existing pavement, including shoulders, to a conditionof structural or functional adequacy. ``Pavement Structure'' would be a combination of a subbase, base course,and surface course placed on a subgrade to support the traffic load anddistribute it to the roadbed.   <T3>Section 626.5 Policy.    </T3>This section is being revised to provide for the requirement of establishinga Pavement Management System (PMS) to be implemented within a reasonablelength of time, not to exceed 4 years from the effective date of this regulation.The PMS would be a procedure adopted by the SHA's which would include planning,construction, maintenance, rehabilitation, and evaluation criteria to assistdecision-makers in finding the optimum strategy for providing, evaluatingand maintaining pavements in a serviceable condition. The procedure adoptedwill provide for a system encompassing current technology and procedures,local conditions, materials, and performance experience.   This section will also be revised to include the citations to the referencepublications discussed above (Management Guide and the 1986 Guide). TheGuide will be recommended for guidance and reference to be used by theSHA's in the adoption of a PMS process. The FHWA will use the Guides andother appropriate criteria as a basis for approval of the SHA's PMS. EachSHA's PMS should be based on the concepts described in the Management Guidewhich includes the following components:   <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Inventory   </ITAG>An inventory of the Federal-aid System with early emphasis on high volumeroads should be established. This inventory should include all necessarydata (materials, structural composition, etc.) to assure that locationand composition of each section of pavement can be readily accessed.  <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Database   </ITAG>There should be a collection, storage, processing, and retrieval of pavementcondition and serviceability data for the Federal-aid System. This datashould not only be adequate to satisfy determinations of need but shouldform the basis of an historical data bank which can be used for establishingcriteria for design, construction, maintenance and/or rehabilitation ofpavements.   <ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Assessment of Pavement Performance   </ITAG>A measurement should be made of the change in condition and/or serviceabilityover time. History of pavement performance indicating the serviceabilityof various materials, structure layers, and pavement composition for usein determining trends and capabilities of various design, construction,maintenance and/or rehabilitation standards should be accumulated.   <ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Network Needs Assessment   </ITAG>There should be an ability to provide current and projected network needswith consideration of budget and other constraints.   <ITAG tagnum="81">(5) Analysis   </ITAG>(a) There should be an ability to provide and analyze performance dataover time for construction, reconstruction and rehabilitation alternatesand strategies.   (b) There should also be an ability to analyze project alternatives andstrategies including cost effectiveness and prioritization with considerationof restraints.   (c) An ability to provide and consider feedback should be included. Reliableperformance data on rehabilitation techniques is necessary in the rehabilitationdesign process.   <ITAG tagnum="81">(6) Design   </ITAG>Design and rehabilitation strategies should be guided by the 1986 AASHTO``Guide for Design of Pavement Structures'' or other practices and proceduresthat based on past performance have proven satisfactory in that locale.  It is recognized that most SHA's are well along in the development of aPMS or have a PMS in operation that includes the basic components listedabove. The FHWA Division Administrator will work closely with those agenciesthat are in the early stages of developing a PMS to ensure compliance withthe 4 year time frame for full implementation.   This section will further be revised to require each SHA to have a comprehensiveprocess for the type selection and design of a new, reconstructed or rehabilitatedpavement structure as part of its PMS. The SHA's are strongly encouragedto use the 1986 Guide in developing their comprehensive process for pavementtype selection and pavement structure design. It will, however, be acceptablefor SHA's to design pavement structures based upon other procedures andpractices that by past performance have proven satisfactory for the pertinentconditions. If a SHA elects to use procedures other than AASHTO, the procedureswill require FHWA approval. The FHWA will check or review pavement designin accordance with procedures approved for use by the SHA. No minimum pavementdesign period (now referred to as the performance period) will be specifiedfor new construction.    The SHA's will be required to perform economic analyses that consider alternatedesign strategies. The principles of economic analyses dictate that alleconomic design strategies be analyzed over the same time period, now referredto as the analysis period. An analysis period of at least 30 years shallbe used for all projects except that a shorter period may be used for low-volumeroads. The minimum 30 year analysis period restarts with each planned projectfor new construction, reconstruction or major pavement rehabilitation work.The analysis period should include an initial performance period plus atleast one rehabilitation strategy. If an existing pavement structure issound and the cost to restore serviceability is minor when compared tothe cost of a new pavement structure or major rehabilitation, a 30 yearanalysis period may not be necessary and an exception may be granted.An engineering and an economic analysis (life cycle cost) of an appropriaterange of strategies shall be performed. For existing pavements the analysisshould include both reconstruction and rehabilitation alternatives. A final revision to this section includes a requirement that each projectinvolving construction of a pavement shall have a skid resistant surface.Pavement rehabilitation and reconstruction projects shall also incorporateother cost-effective opportunities to enhance safety as required by 23CFR 625.2. Section 626.7 Eligibility. This section is being revised to establish criteria to be used in determiningeligibility of proposed projects. The current provisions contained in andSection;626.7,addressing the process of stage construction and Federal-aid InterstateConstruction funding, are being deleted in their entirety. Stage construction,as previously defined, will no longer be used as a funding mechanism. The first revision requires that the design of new and reconstructed pavementsshall be a cost-effective solution based on the approved PMS. This cost-effectivesolution should include an analysis of the life cycle costs. It is essentialthat a SHA have sufficient data to document the life cycle costs and performanceof each pavement type. The second revision requires that the design of rehabilitated pavementsshall provide for a minimum performance period of 8 years and be a cost-effectivesolution. The granting of exceptions is permissible when historical performancedata and economic analyses indicate a lesser performance period would beappropriate. Any type of rehabilitation work may be eligible, providingthat the SHA can document that the proposed design will perform satisfactorilyover the performance period. As a minimum, this documentation should besupported by historical performance data. The third revision requires that pavement maintenance not be eligible.The importance of adequate pavement maintenance of the pavement structure,including incidental items, is recognized as essential to satisfactorypavement performance. SHA's are expected to perform satisfactory maintenancewith their own funds. On April 24, 1985, the FHWA published a notice at 50 FR 16103 outliningthe rulemaking procedures that would be taken to effectuate Federal adoptionof the 1986 Guide, including an independent review by the FHWA and provisionsfor public comment. At the time of the April 24, 1985, notice, only a draftof the 1986 Guide had been completed by AASHTO. Since the publication forwhich the 1986 Guide was prepared to replace was incorporated by referencein Part 626, it was the intention of FHWA at that time to also incorporateby reference the 1986 Guide. As discussed above, the May 7, 1986, finalrule announced a new publication citation policy which would differentiatebetween publications establishing Federal standards and publications containingguidance and informational material. Since the April 24, 1985, notice,the FHWA has determined that the 1986 Guide should be redesignated andplaced in the ``Guide and reference'' section of andSection;625.5 and theincorporation by reference withdrawn. Although the incorporation by referencefor the 1986 Guide is being withdrawn, the FHWA will still consider commentson the contents of the 1986 Guide as well as the Management Guide in theinterests of public involvement and participation. Therefore, summariesof the 1986 Guide and Management Guide are being provided. Copies of theGuides may be purchased from AASHTO, 444 North Capitol Street NW., Suite225, Washington, DC 20001 or copies of the Guides may be inspected in theDocket room as listed in the <T2>``ADDRESS'' </T2>section above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1986 Guide)</ITAG>The following discussion provides a synopsis of the contents of the 1986Guide and, as appropriate, any significant additions, revisions, or deletionsmade to the Interim Guide. The 1986 Guide outlines the procedures and guidelinesfor the structural design and rehabilitation of flexible (asphalt concrete)and rigid (portland cement concrete) highway pavements. The 1986 Guideis divided into four parts. Part I is entitled ``Pavement Design and Management Principles.'' Chapter1 contains a general description of concepts and principles of pavementdesign as applied in the 1986 Guide. Chapter 2 introduces pavement managementprinciples for the organization of design parameters into a systematicapproach to obtain consistent and rational design recommendations. Chapter3 examines the economic aspects of pavement design and rehabilitation.Chapter 4 provides a general description of the concept of pavement designreliability. Chapter 5 is a summary. Part II is entitled ``Pavement Design Procedures for New Construction andReconstruction.'' Chapter 1 deals with introductory, background, and organizationmaterial while Chapter 2 identifies all the design requirements and inputsthat will be required by the design procedure. Chapters 3 and 4 presentthe design methodology for highway pavements and low-volume roads, respectively.Part III is entitled, ``Pavement Design Procedure for Rehabilitation ofExisting Pavements.'' Chapter 1 presents basic introductory, background,and organizational material and Chapter 2 discusses the alternative rehabilitationmethods available and provides a basis for identifying feasible alternatives.Chapter 3 discusses the field data collection program. Chapter 4 discussesthe details of evaluating rehabilitation methods other than overlays whileChapter 5 deals directly with the evaluation of overlay alternatives. Part IV is entitled ``Mechanistic-Empirical Design Procedures.'' The mainobjective of this part is to provide guidelines for use by agencies interestedin developing and implementing improved and comprehensive design conceptsfor both new construction and for rehabilitation of in-service pavements.The major changes which have been included in the 1986 Guide include thefollowing considerations: 1. <T3>Reliability</T3>_The procedure for design of both rigid and flexiblepavement provides a common method for incorporating a reliability factorinto the design based on a shift in the design traffic.2. <T3>Soil support value_</T3>The AASHTO test method T274 (resilient modulusof roadbed soils) is recommended as the definitive test for characterizingsoil support. The soil property is recommended for use both with flexibleand rigid pavement design. 3. <T3>Layer coefficients (flexible pavements)</T3>_The resilient modulustest has been recommended as the procedure to be used in assigning layercoefficients to both stabilized and unstabilized material. 4. <T3>Drainage</T3>_Provision has been made in the 1986 Guide to improveguidance in the design of subsurface drainage systems and for modifyingthe design equations to take advantage of improved performance attributedto good drainage design. 5. <T3>Environment</T3>_Improvements in the 1986 Guide have been made in orderto account for the affects of environmental factors, e.g., forest heave,and swelling soils. Major emphasis is given to thaw weakening and the effectthat seasonal variations have on performance. 6. <T3>Tied shoulder and widened lanes (rigid pavements)</T3>_A procedureis provided for the design of rigid pavements with tied shoulders or widenedoutside lanes. 7. <T3>Subbase erosion</T3>_A method for adjusting the design equations torepresent possible soil erosion under rigid pavements is provided. 8. <T3>Life cycle costs</T3>_Information has been added relative to economicanalysis and comparisons of alternate designs based on life cycle costs.Present worth and/or equivalent uniform annual cost evaluations duringa specified analysis period are recommended for making economic analyses.9. <T3>Rehabilitation</T3>_A major addition contained in the 1986 Guide isthe inclusion of a section on rehabilitation. Information is provided forrehabilitation with or without overlays. 10. <T3>Pavement management</T3>_Background information is provided regardingpavement management and the role of the 1986 Guide in the overall schemeof pavement management. 11. <T3>Load equivalency values</T3>_Load equivalency values have been extendedto include heavier loads, more axles, and terminal serviceability levelsof up to 3.0. 12. <T3>Traffic</T3>_Extensive information concerning methods for calculatingequivalent single axle loads and specific problems related to obtainingreliable estimates of traffic loading are provided. 13. <T3>Low volume roads</T3>_A special category for design of pavements subjectedto a relatively small number of heavy loads is provided in the design section.14. <T3>Mechanistic-Empirical design procedure</T3>_The state of the knowledgeconcerning mechanistic-empirical design concepts is provided in the 1986Guide. While the actual design procedures have not, as yet, been incorporatedinto the 1986 Guide, extensive discussion is provided as to how such methodscould be applied in the future. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of AASHTO Guidelines on Pavement Management (Management Guide)</ITAG>The publication defines the terms associated with pavement management.Both the network and project levels of pavement management activities arediscussed. An approach to improved pavement management is provided as wellas steps for implementing a new or enhanced pavement management system.The FHWA, through this notice of proposed rulemaking, is requesting commentson the proposed policy revision and effect on the Federal-aid highway program,as well as comments on specific elements of the criteria contained in the1986 Guide and Management Guide. A final rule will be issued on the proposedpolicy revision after careful analysis and consideration of public commentsreceived. If at the time of issuance of the final rule, the 1986 Guideor Management Guide contain material not acceptable to the FHWA, such materialwould be noted and excluded, and as required, alternative critieria willbe adopted for use on Federal-aid projects. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291 or a significant regulation under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. The FHWA hasalso determined that the expected impact of these proposed revisions willbe minimal. This determination is based on the fact that the SHA's willbe required to merely formalize the pavement management processes thatare currently being followed. In addition, the basic design criteria forpavement design remains essentially unchanged. The material contained inthe publications ``Guidelines on Pavement Management, AASHTO 1985'' andthe 1986 ``AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures'' is not in facta policy or standard, but simply provides guidance for use at the discretionof the designer. The SHA's will be allowed to continue to use the samebasic pavement design procedures based on past performances. Variationsfrom present practices and technical criteria will not be significant.As stated in the preamble, the preparation of a Pavement Management System(PMS) should not place any undue burdens on the States' resources. As apractical matter, most SHA's have informally been establishing a procedurefor the selection and design of new pavement structures and rehabilitationstrategies. Therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. Forthe same reasons and under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act(Pub. L. 96-354), it is hereby certified that this action, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511),the reporting or recordkeeping requirements that are included in the proposedregulation will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management andBudget.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway,Planning and Construction.
