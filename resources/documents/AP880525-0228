Gorbachev in Moscow thisweekend.   ``I'm fairly confident we will be able to finish the treatyFriday or Saturday,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,D-W.Va., said.   That would mean the treaty could be approved in time to fly theratification notice to Moscow so the president could present it toGorbachev during the May 29-June 2 summit, Byrd noted.   Reagan left Washington on Wednesday for the summit, with athree-day stopover in Helsinki, Finland, en route.   Ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pactrequires 67 votes and is assured because 90 or more senatorssupport the treaty, according to supporters and critics of the pact.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the treaty's chief critic, conceded hehad failed in his attempt to modify the accord, which Reagan andGorbachev signed Dec. 8 in Washington.   ``I'm licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty,'' Helmstold reporters.   Later, Helms admitted, ``I've had no illusions from the verybeginning about the prospects of defeating this treaty.''   The treaty requires elimination within three years of all U.S.and Soviet nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400miles. It would result in the elimination of 867 U.S. missiles inEurope and elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles.   Helms, Byrd and other Senate leaders met behind closed doors towork out an agreement that would end the procedural snarl which hasblocked definitive action on the pact since it reached the floorlast week.   Helms and other critics, using Senate rules designed to protectthe rights of the minority, have stalled action, filing a series ofamendments that were rejected overwhelmingly.   In response, Byrd and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,filed a cloture motion to halt debate. That motion is set for avote Thursday. Approval of the motion requires 60 votes and isassured, meaning the debate would be limited to 30 hours. Thatwould set up a final vote Friday.   The back-stage talks were aimed at setting aside the cloturevote, which also would mean the Senate could avoid the all-nightsession which would be required if cloture were invoked.   Helms said that after the cloture motion was filed, he realized``the ball game was over.'' But he said he still was seekingapproval of some amendments which could be attached as conditionsto the resolution of ratification.   But there was no agreement by late Wednesday afternoon, meaningthe cloture vote was likely to go ahead Thursday morning.   Meantime, the chamber voted 89-9 to reject a Helms amendmentwhich would have abrogated the treaty if the United States foundthat the Soviets had furnished false information. It was the 10thtime the Senate had voted overwhelming rejection of amendmentsoffered by GOP conservatives.   ``The Soviets have cheated (on other treaties), they arecheating now, and they will continue to cheat,'' said Helms.   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the proposal would be a``killer amendment'' that would require the pact to be renegotiatedwith the Soviets.   Dole said the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, ``as do all summits,offers the promise of progress ... and the peril of inflatedexpectations.''   He urged the Senate to ``do our part'' and approve the INF pact,which he noted is ``the first ever to reduce existing nuclearstockpiles and eliminate whole classes of nuclear weapons.''   One unresolved issue in the Senate was the fate of aDemocratic-backed proposal which would require Senate approvalbefore any future president could change how the treaty isinterpreted.   That amendment, added by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,arises from a long-running fight over a separate issue involvingthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Reagan asserts that the White House can unilaterally change theinterpretation of a treaty, a view disputed by congressionalDemocrats.   Many Senate Republicans oppose that amendment, Sen. ArlenSpecter, R-Pa., noted Wednesday.   ``This issue of treaty interpretation is one that will havefar-reaching consequences,'' Specter told his colleagues.   Byrd said Democrats still haven't decided the specific languageof that amendment.</TEXT></DOC>
