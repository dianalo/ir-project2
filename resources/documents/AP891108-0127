(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge who told a divorcee she couldn'tlive with her boyfriend and keep her child is out of touch with thetimes, observed a state Supreme Court justice who said the casereminded her of ``Harper Valley P.T.A.''   Two high court justices on a panel considering an appeal by themother noted Tuesday that it's rare these days for custody disputesto be settled on the basis of alleged misconduct by a spouse after adivorce.   The mother, Judith Roush, asked the court to overturn an order byKanawha County Judge John Hey, who gave her 30 days to marry herboyfriend, move out of his house or give up custody of her14-year-old daughter, Melissa.   Hay issued the order Aug. 23 order at the request of Mrs. Roush'sformer husband, Rodney Dell Roush. They were divorced in January1988.   At the Supreme Court hearing, Justice Margaret Workman saidrepeated court decisions have rejected the notion that cohabitationis grounds for removing a child from a parent's custody.   ``It reminds me of `Harper Valley P.T.A.,''' Workman said,recalling the hit 1968 ballad of small-town moralizing.   Justice Richard Neely said the notion of defining post-maritalmisconduct is impossible in modern society.   ``How do you define misconduct?'' Neely said. ``Nobody in theworld agrees on misconduct.''   The appeal said Hey rejected the recommendation of a courtofficial known as a family law master because Mrs. Roush and herdaughter live with Robert Cain, though he and Mrs. Roush aren'tmarried. The family law master recommended that the girl stay withher mother.   Attorney Larry L. Skeen, who represented Hey at the hearing,noted there's a state law against ``lewd and laciviouscohabitation.'' If the laws of the state on morality are outdated,the state Supreme Court should ``just say they are.''   ``Can you imagine any jury in West Virginia convicting someonefor cohabitating?'' Neely asked.   ``You'd have to pick your jury carefully,'' Skeen said to anoutburst of laughter.   The Supreme Court did not immediately rule.   Mrs. Roush's petition said she earns $80-$100 a week in netincome and cannot afford to maintain an apartment of her own, thesuit said.   Hey was out of his office Tuesday and could not be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
