<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-1079 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using the 27 kG magnetic field produced by a superconducting solenoid,the authors have searched for trapped magnetic monopoles in a magnetitesample from North China. The nuclear emulsion both for low ionizing tracksand heavily ionizing tracks, and the plastic film for heavily ionizingtracks of magnetic monopoles have been scanned. A 90% confidence levelupper limit of 1.8 x 10/sup -26/ monopoles per nucleon in the magnetitesample are obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
