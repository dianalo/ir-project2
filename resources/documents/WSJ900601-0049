The interruption in production has had little impact onworld oil markets because Gabon is the smallest producer inthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, withrecent output of only about 260,000 barrels a day. Outputalso appears to be slowly resuming.</LP><TEXT>   But the disruption is being felt by three major oilcompanies that account for the bulk of Gabon's production:Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, the Royal Dutch/Shell Groupand Amoco Corp. Gabon's crude is particularly attractivebecause it yields more gasoline per barrel than some otherworld crudes.   Industry sources said the most significant impact has beenon the French state-controlled Elf group, which had beenproducing about 101,000 barrels a day in Gabon, a formerFrench colony.   Last weekend, Elf confirmed it had cut output andwithdrawn many employees because of the civil unrest andviolence in the province of Ogooue Maritime and its capitalPort Gentil, Gabon's main port. Some oil-company employees,including several from Elf, were held hostage there for awhile.   Elf didn't fully shut down in Gabon because its facilitiesmust be kept at minimal operating levels to prevent cloggingof pipelines by the waxy, high paraffin-content crudes. Sincethen, Elf said its Gabon unit has resumed production, andLoik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's president, told Paris analyststhat the interruption of production in Gabon shouldn't haveany noticeable effect on 1990 results.   Elf's resumption of output followed an ultimatum by Gabonpresident Omar Bongo that the oil company return to fullproduction or have its operations turned over to othercompanies.   It isn't clear when oil loadings from Port Gentil will beback to normal. But earlier this week Elf's president saidthat the company's output would be restored to normal in 48to 72 hours. Also, according to Dow Jones InternationalPetroleum Report, buyers of Gabonese crude from the Shellgroup, which operates the large Rabi-Kounga field, said theyhad been told cargoes scheduled to load in early June fromGamba, the second-largest oil port, would be delayed by onlyone day.   The Shell group had evacuated non-essential staff andfamilies of expatriates from Gabon last weekend. But thegroup reported a majority of its expatriate employees, about130, remained in Gabon. Still, according to some reports,total oil output in Gabon fell as low as 50,000 barrels aday.   Although average Gabonese output for May probably toppedthe country's official OPEC quota of 197,000 barrels a day,the Oil Daily's Energy Compass estimated that physicalproduction losses are approaching a total of one millionbarrels.   &quot;A drop in the ocean as far as world oil supplies areconcerned, the disruption to oil output and exports fromriot-torn Gabon could, nonetheless, make some small impact onthe relatively tight market in light West African crudeswhich are mostly destined for the U.S.,&quot; the London-basedpublication reported.</TEXT></DOC>
