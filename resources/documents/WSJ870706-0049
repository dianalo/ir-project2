The composer had set up a card table with all these esoteric instruments for me to play. During a quiet moment in the score, the table collapsed and everything crashed to the floor.&quot;    Being a free-lance percussionist has its drawbacks, but it never gets boring. &quot;I like the variety inherent in different musical situations,&quot; says 28-year-old Daniel Druckman, whose recent engagements included working as an extra with the New York Philharmonic, playing contemporary music concerts and recording a dog-food commercial.    Part of that diversity derives from the instruments themselves. Although most percussionists specialize in, say, the timpani or the marimba, they are required to play a vast assortment of sound makers, from wood blocks, cowbells and maracas to Tibetan prayer stones and Coke bottles. &quot;Anything you can strike, shake or rub,&quot; observes Caldwell Titcomb, a professor of music at Brandeis University and author of monographs on the subject, &quot;can be used as a percussion instrument.&quot;    Anything indeed. The 38-year-old Mr. Gottlieb, one of the busiest free-lancers around, has performed a frenzied cadenza on a car chassis, swirled marbles in a salad bowl, and smashed plates in the line of duty.    Free-lancer Jonathan Haas spent two hours combing through a junkyard looking for four anvils that would produce specific pitches when struck with a hammer. He needed them for the American premiere of &quot;Fourteen Stations&quot; by the Romanian-born composer Marius Constant at Merkin Hall two years ago. &quot;The guys who worked there thought I was wacko,&quot; he remembers.    However, locating the anvils was the least of his worries. &quot;Fourteen Stations&quot; is scored for 108 percussion instruments (one player), electric harpsichord, cello, viola, violin, trombone and guitar. &quot;It took 14 months to learn my part,&quot; says the 32-year-old Mr. Haas, the timpanist of the New York Chamber Symphony, &quot;and eight stagehands to help set it up.&quot;    Such monster percussion works are part of an ongoing trend that began in the late 19th century, when symphonic composers began writing parts for the xylophone, castanets, rattles and newly invented celesta. The development of the modern marimba and vibraphone in the early 20th century further expanded the percussionist's arsenal beyond the traditional timpani, triangle and cymbals. More recently, composers have used dozens of exotic, ethnic instruments in their scores.    Others have extended the percussionist's role theatrically, requiring him to burn incense, traipse down concert halls beating a drum and -- a curiously recurring theme -- go mad. In &quot;El Cimarron&quot; (1970), a 75-minute chamber piece about a runaway Cuban slave by German composer Hans Werner Henze, the percussionist leaps athletically around the stage, striking gongs, marimbas and drums with pentup fury. In &quot;Paradigm&quot; (1968), by American composer-conductor Lukas Foss, the percussionist loses control, kicks a gong and hits the music stands of the other players.    &quot;I guess it looks better to go crazy on the drums than on the fiddle,&quot; suggests 36-year-old Joseph Passaro, who has performed both works with Speculum Musicae, the contemporary music ensemble. &quot;It's also less destructive. We don't play 300-year-old instruments which sell in six figures.&quot;    The percussion family has its own ancient, if uneven, history nonetheless. The earliest man-made instruments were probably the phallic-shaped notched bone scrapers used by early Stone Age tribes in their love rituals. In primitive African cultures, the drum was worshipped as a deity. By the time of the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods, timpanists in Western Europe enjoyed the same privileged association with royalty as trumpeters. &quot;They were very conscious of their prerogatives,&quot; says Mr. Titcomb, &quot;and refused to perform with orchestral string players unless stationed, along with the trumpets, on a raised platform or balcony.&quot;    Unfortunately, the strings proved more attractive to composers. While there are eloquent solo passages for timpani in works by such composers as Beethoven, Mahler and Strauss, the bulk of the traditional symphonic repertoire treats the timpani as the rhythmic &quot;heartbeat&quot; of the orchestra and relegates secondary percussion instruments to occasional coloristic effects. &quot;There are cymbal players who have fallen asleep waiting to hit their one big note,&quot; observes Mr. Haas.    By contrast, contemporary composers such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Elliott Carter, George Crumb, Jacob Druckman (the father of Daniel) and Steve Reich treat percussionists as full-fledged musical partners. This has stimulated the founding of specialized percussion ensembles such as Nexus and the Manhattan Marimba Quartet. (The latter will appear in concert at Dartmouth's Hopkins Center in Hanover, N.H., on July 10 and give a pre-performance recital at the Jacob's Pillow Festival in Becket, Mass., the next day.)    Yet today's versatile free-lancers face other problems. Most of them supplement their incomes with studio work, where drum machines and digital sampling techniques have reduced job opportunities for percussionists. Do they ever long for the regular hours and economic security of a full-time symphony slot?    &quot;No way,&quot; declares Mr. Gottlieb, whose colleagues typically describe him as &quot;a phenomenon.&quot; He is too busy working as an extra with the New York Philharmonic, playing bongos, shakers and udo drums (clay pots with holes) on a recent album by rock star Debbie (&quot;Blondie&quot;) Harry, and performing a solo work of his own composition at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival on July 17.    Mr. Druckman, a virtuoso mallet player who demonstrated his impressive skills at his Weill Recital Hall concert with Alan Feinberg last month, says: &quot;A lot of orchestral playing involves sitting out most of a piece and then getting up to execute perfectly. Contemporary music allows me a more active role. On the other hand, symphony musicians regularly perform some of the greatest works ever written. I can't say I do that when I play Broadway shows or dog-food jingles.&quot;    ---   Ms. Jepson frequently writes about music from New York. </TEXT></DOC>
