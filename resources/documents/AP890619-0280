At the same time, administration officials rejected a suggestionby House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., that President Bushintensify his condemnation of the Beijing government in view of therecent death sentences for student dissidents.   ``I think we've said everything we have to say on China. Thepresident's quite clear on that,'' deputy press secretary RomanPopadiuk told a White House briefing.   Overall, the Bush administration maintained its reserve aboutdevelopments in China.   ``The president is quite anxious we not do anything that wouldhurt the Chinese people,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIsaid.   ``The United States has been speaking out. We've been speakingout quite vigorously,'' Baker said in response to reporters'questions.   Popadiuk disputed a report that Bush was appalled by faulty U.S.intelligence reports on China, including an erroneous dispatch thatChinese leader Deng Xiaoping had lapsed into a coma.   The report, in the current issue of U.S. News andamp; World Report,said that Bush _ who headed the CIA in the Ford administration _intended to replace CIA director William Webster by year's end.   ``The CIA is doing a superb job,'' Popadiuk said. ``There is notruth to the article and the president supports Director Webster.''   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that,despite what she called ``a pause in anti-U.S. propaganda over theweekend,'' the situation in China remains ``far from normal.''   ``The department's travel advisory warning Americans againsttravel to China remains in effect,'' she said. ``We are not going tolift our travel advisory.''   Asked if she had any advice for U.S. businesses wanting toreturn, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``We cannot be encouraging Americans togo back to China when we have a State Department policy warningadvising them not to travel in China.''   Both White House and State Department officials said that no newsanctions were planned against the Beijing government _ beyond thehalt in military sales announced two weeks ago by Bush _ despite acall over the weekend by Foley for a more aggressive U.S. stance.   ``The president has spoken very succinctly on this ... how heviews this relationship, how important this relationship is betweenthese two countries. He has ... said he did not want to do anythingto hurt the Chinese people, that that is where we are,'' Ms.Tutwiler said.   Foley, interviewed Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said Bushshould be speaking out more forcefully in opposition to the harshChinese crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents.   The speaker also said the United States should break relationsimmediately with China if the Chinese use violence against the U.S.Embassy in Beijing to seize dissident Fang Lizhi, who sought refugethere two weeks ago.   The U.S. decision to harbor Fang and his wife Li Shuxian hasangered the Chinese leadership, which has accused the United Statesof interfering in China's internal affairs.   Fang remains in the U.S. Embassy, officials said.   Ms. Tutwiler would not comment on whether the State Departmenthad urged Fang's son against a trip to Washington. ``I'm not goingto take responsiblity for somehow maybe getting someone's personalsafety in jeopardy,'' she said.   Ms. Tutwiler also said that tough new restrictions by China onobtaining exit visas for Chinese who wish to leave the country _ dueto take effect on Tuesday _ had produced extremely long lines at thevisa office in Shanghai.</TEXT></DOC>
