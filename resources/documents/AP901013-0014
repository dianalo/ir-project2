(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Marilyn Quayle and her daughter rodeNational Park Service horses in Manassas National Battlefield Parka week ago when the park was officially closed to the public in thegovernment shutdown.   The park superintendent and the vice president's press spokesmanon Friday confirmed an account of the Oct. 6 visit that appeared inthe Fairfax Journal.   The visit occurred when the 22-member park staff was furloughed,as were many workers throughout the federal government. Three lawenforcement rangers were the only staff on duty, and theyaccompanied Mrs. Quayle and her 11-year-old daughter, Corinne, saidpark superintendent Ken Apschnikat.   Apschnikat said he closed the main gates, the visitors centerand two parking lots, but otherwise made no attempt to keep peopleout of the park about 25 miles southwest of Washington. The park isthe site of two famous Civil War battles.   ``It would be very difficult to close the whole park, and I madeno attempt to,'' Apschnikat said.   The 4,345-acre park is crisscrossed by several major highways.Many visitors slipped under gates or climbed over fences. TheQuayles arrived through a back entrance.   The Quayle family frequently visits the park to ride the ninehorses stabled there, which are normally reserved for the rangers.   Dan Quayle's spokesman, David Beckwith, said he saw nothinginappropriate in the visit to the park.   Beckwith said, ``The horses weren't on furlough.''</TEXT></DOC>
