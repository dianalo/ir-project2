The mean monthly acitvityconcentrations of up to 30 radionuclides measured in 1986 and 1987 inBrunswick, Berlin and Skibotn (North Norway) are tabulated. The Chernobylaccident of April 26, 1986, resulted in 1986 in an annual mean Cs-137activity concentration of 2.4 mBq/m/sup 3/ in Brunswick, 8.8 mBq/m/sup3/ in Berlin and 0.3 mBq/m/sup 3/ at Skibotn. In 1987 the Cs-137 concentrationswere just about 1% of these values. Occasionally fresh fission productsfrom other sources were detected as e.g. I-131 in March 1987 (very likelyreleased from a reactor site in Ukraine) and in August 1987 (releasedfrom an underground nuclear test on Novaja Zemlya together with othershort-lived fission products). The effective dose equivalent due to inhalationof fission products is estimated for all three sites and compared withthe Pb-210 inhalation dose.</TEXT></DOC>
