Meanwhile, on the foreign-exchange markets yesterday, the U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed in what traders described as quiet, thin markets.    West German bankers predicted that the new range for monetary growth will be between 3% and 6%, wider than this year's target of 3.5% to 5.5%. The German money supply has expanded quickly this year, growing at a 7.8% annual rate in the first 11 months and a 10% annual pace from July through November, according to the Bundesbank, the German central bank.    The fast growth has posed a policy problem for West Germany, which has resisted U.S. pressure to adopt measures to stimulate its economy. Bonn contends the nation's economy is growing fast enough, and officials argue that the surging money supply prohibits lowering interest rates, a step that Bonn fears could rekindle inflation.    In fact, during a period of a little more than a month, the Bundesbank has raised the one-month repurchase rate on government securities to 4.65% from 4.35%. &quot;They've totally undone the easing they first undertook with the coordinated interest-rate cut of last spring,&quot; said John Lipsky, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc.    Mr. Lipsky questioned whether another year of narrow monetary-growth targets is consistent with Bonn's forecast of 3% inflation-adjusted economic growth for 1987. &quot;It could imply higher interest rates to keep the money supply in that range,&quot; he said.    Jeff Mondschein, a vice president at Merrill Lynch International, said that with higher German rates, &quot;there'd be no incentive to invest in U.S. capital markets.&quot; He noted that the difference in yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds and their German equivalents currently stands at one percentage point, a 10-year low.    &quot;If that differential narrows, it would put tremendous downward pressure on the dollar,&quot; said Mr. Mondschein. That, in turn, would further damage German exports and also make it difficult for the U.S. to fund its large budget deficit.    Thus, Mr. Mondschein and others said they expect the Bundesbank to be flexible in its monetary policy, despite present targets.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 2.0150 West German marks, down from 2.0203 marks Tuesday. It fell to 163.48 yen from 164.03. The British pound declined to $1.4297 from $1.4314.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 163.45 yen from 163.48 in New York yesterday afternoon.    Traders said the dollar was caught between conflicting influences that kept it trading in a narrow range of one pfennig and 0.65 yen. The U.S. currency fell slightly in early New York trading because of a White House announcement that President Ronald Reagan will have prostate surgery in January.    The market didn't react to the Commerce Department's report that the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.8% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter, after accounting for inflation, traders said. The latest figure was down from a previously reported 2.9%, but within market expectations.    Supporting the dollar, said traders, was continued year-end demand for the currency from U.S. multinational corporations seeking to convert foreign earnings.    Slightly higher U.S. interest rates also helped the unit. Three-month Eurodollar rates at one point rose to 6.44% from 6.25% early in Asian markets. By late in New York trading, they had dropped back to 6.31%.    Traders emphasized that markets were thin and would probably remain that way until Jan. 5, the start of the first full week of 1987 trading. They noted that most multinational corporations satisfied their currency needs in early December and that many banks have effectively closed their books for the year.    Martin P. Egli, senior vice president at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co., New York, said that &quot;some big foreign banks had stopped quoting (exchange rates) in preparation of year end.&quot;    Mr. Egli attributed the U.S. interest-rate increases to &quot;window dressing&quot; by banks and some corporations. For example, banks will sometimes increase short-term borrowing at year's end to expand their balance sheet -- both to make it correspond to present budget planning and to report stronger results in their annual reports. The practice can be especially pronounced abroad, where, for instance, interest rates in Switzerland can be pushed up at an annual rate of 30% to 40% for a few days.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $392.20 an ounce, down $1.00. The estimated volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $392.25 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                           New York    Home Mkt.
