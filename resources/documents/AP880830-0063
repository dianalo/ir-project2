The cease-fire at sea is part of the problem,''Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said.   Formal sessions between Foreign Ministers Ali Akbar Velayati ofIran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq have been suspended since Friday. Plansfor a formal session Monday were shelved without explanation, andno formal talks were planned today.   Low-level talks with Iran and Iraq were continuing.   In an interview today, Velayati told The Associated Press thatIran would not grant Iraq any concessions which it had failed towin in the 8-year-old war. He blamed Iraq for lack of progress inthe talks.   Velayati said Iraq was facing many internal difficulties, adding:   ``We think this is the main reason they are looking for someadvantage, some concessions. But if they couldn't get anyconcessions during this long war with a lot of casualties, ofcourse they will not be able to get any concessions or anythingbeyond their legal rights during the peace talks.''   Tehran Radio today quoted Velayati as saying Iraq had raised``unnecessary or out-of-place issues to disrupt the talks.''   In the interview with Tehran Radio monitored in Nicosia, he saidhe hoped Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. Security Council and othernations can pressure Iraq and ``put a stop to this deviating course... or force them to come back to the correct path.''   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar met withrepresentatives of the five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil _ the United States, Britain, China, France and the SovietUnion _ on Monday to brief them on the negotiations.   Giuliani did not comment on the discussions. But diplomatsspeculated that the U.N. chief was hoping the five nations wouldhelp get the talks moving.   Iraq has been insisting on an early reopening of theShatt-al-Arab waterway, which has been blocked by sunken shipssince early in the war. Iran has said clearing the waterway _Iraq's only outlet to the sea _ should come later after a permanentcease-fire and troop withdrawal.   Talks reportedly faltered at the ministerial level because ofthe dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab. Baghdad claims sovereignty overthe entire Shatt-al-Arab. Iran claims rights to half of it. Theissue is central to the talks because the U.N. peace plan calls fortroop withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries.   Perez de Cuellar said today: ``You all think that everything isthe Shatt-al-Arab _ this is not quite true. This is one of thedifficulties we are facing and not the only one.''   Aziz said Monday that it would be impossible to advance to otherpoints until Iran agreed that the cease-fire extended over allPersian Gulf waters.   ``It is a very difficult problem and it cannot be expected thatthis will be resolved in a few days,'' Perez de Cuellar said.   The talks began Thursday to try forge a peace treaty and atimetable for troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange under aU.N.-mediated Aug. 20 cease-fire.   The two countries have in the past often ignored previousagreements on the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, a point of friction sincethe days of the Persian and Ottoman empires.   A Western diplomat trying to settle the question in 1914 calledit ``a phenomenon of procrastination unparalleled in the chroniclesof oriental diplomacy.''   Five days before Iraqi troops invaded Iran in September 1980after weeks of border clashes, President Saddam Hussein of Iraqtore up the latest treaty on the waterway, the Algiers Agreement of1975, during a televised speech.   The agreement between Hussein, then foreign minister, and thelate Shah of Iran set the border between the two nations in themiddle of the 125 mile-long waterway, instead of its Iranian bank _a dividing line in a 1969 agreement.   Velayati said Monday that Iraq could not unilaterally abrogatethe 1975 treaty. But Aziz told reporters that it was ``Iran thatalways abrogated previous agreements, imposing new ones by force.''   ``This reflects the situation in the 17th, 18th, 19th and earlyin the 20 centuries, right up to present times,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
