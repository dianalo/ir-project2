(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Contributors have whittled the $11 milliondebt of the Oral Roberts Ministries down to $2.2 million, with therest expected to be raised by Wednesday, the son of the foundersaid Monday.   ``We haven't quite done it, but we're very close,'' OralRoberts' son and fellow evangelist, Richard, said on his dailytelevision show.   Oral Roberts said March 28 that the $11 million was owed to4,000 vendors and suppliers of the Oral Roberts Ministry, OralRoberts University and the City of Faith Medical Center. He said ifthe money wasn't raised by May 6, graduation day at the university,creditors could begin to dismantle the university and hospital.   He said later the date was extended until Monday because May 6was a Saturday. Monday, his son said on his TV show that creditorswere being asked for a three-day extension.   Mark Swadener, the ministry's chief financial officer, issued astatement saying that while all vendors have not been paid, ``wehave attempted to make some payment to virtually all of them sinceApril 1.''   ``Our vendors generally do not view us in a bad light, but theydo want to be paid,'' the statement said.   Attempts to reach Swadener for further comment were notsuccessful. Ministry workers repeatedly said he could not bedisturbed. Other ministry officials referred callers to Swadener'soffice.   One vendor, the company that provided medical personnel for thehospital, filed a lawsuit last week seeking $17,032 in staffingpayments for the period from Dec. 16 through Feb. 3.   Oral Roberts has blamed ``a spirit of skepticism'' from scandalsinvolving TV evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart for adecline in monthly contributions from $5 million to $2.7 millionover the past two years.   It was two years ago that the elder Roberts made hiscontroversial announcement that he needed $8 million for hismedical school or God would end his life.   Both Roberts and his son have made pleas for money on theirtelevision shows since March 28. They also staged a four-hour,prime-time telethon.   Some cost-cutting moves have been initiated by the ministry.Roberts announced last week that the 4,000-student university isdropping out of NCAA competition to save $500,000 to $1 million ayear. In addition, some television commitments also are beingcurtailed.</TEXT></DOC>
