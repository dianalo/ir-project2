After finishing the fifth round of U.S.-China negotiationsconcerning intellectual-property rights on Sunday evening,Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Joseph Massey said thetalks were at an impasse because China had withdrawnconcessions made in earlier sessions.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They did retract some of the things they had earlier puton the table,&quot; said Mr. Massey. &quot;I think they are under heavypressure from interests in China that benefit heavily frompiracy.&quot;   The negotiations stem from the U.S. belief that China'slaws provide inadequate protection for copyrights andpatents, and are the result of a U.S. investigation ofChina's intellectual-property practices that began in April.   Mr. Massey refused to give details of the negotiations,but he said that there still is substantial disagreement onboth patents and copyrights. The U.S. wants China to modifyits 1984 Patent Law and its 1991 Copyright Law. The patentlaw protects processes, not products. So U.S. makers ofchemicals and pharmaceuticals, among others, say that Chinasteals their products by altering the manufacturing processslightly. On copyrights, the U.S. complaint is that China'slaw leaves almost all movies, plays, books, computer softwareand music recordings unprotected.   On Sunday, Mr. Massey accused China of being &quot;the singlelargest pirate world-wide&quot; of U.S. copyrighted and patentedmaterials. Mr. Massey said that he left the weekend's 10hours of talks with the belief that Chinese negotiators willmodify their position for the next round, which will be thefinal session.   Mr. Massey said that the next session will take placesometime after Jan. 8. U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hillshas announced that unless an agreement is reached by Jan. 16,the U.S. will enact punitive tariffs against Chinese exportsto the U.S. Early this month, the U.S. published a 20-pagelist of products that would be potential targets of thetariffs.   That list, which includes Chinese exports to the U.S.valued at $1.5 billion, includes such products as beer, silkclothing, shoes, pharmaceuticals, jewelry and raw materials.Mr. Massey says the U.S. is trying to target products made bystate-owned factories or Chinese ministries that pirate U.S.products. &quot;We want to pinch the toe in the boot that iskicking us,&quot; said Mr. Massey.   There are other potentially explosive trade disputesbetween the U.S. and China. The U.S. Congress for severalyears has been trying to repeal China's most favored nationtrading status. And the U.S. is investigating Chinesebarriers to U.S. imports. Those talks, if unsuccessful, couldalso lead to punitive tariffs. The U.S. is expected to haveat least a $12 billion trade deficit with China this year.</TEXT></DOC>
