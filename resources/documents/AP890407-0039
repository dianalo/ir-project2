The information is contained in a U.S. government ``admission offacts'' focusing on the Reagan administration's secret assistanceto the Contra rebels at a time when Congress had cut off militaryaid to the rebel force.   In late September 1986, North reported to his boss,then-national security adviser John Poindexter ``on his Londonmeeting with Noriega,'' said a portion of the 42-page admission.   ``Noriega would try to take immediate actions against theSandinistas and offered a list of priorities including an oilrefinery, an airport and the Puerto Sandino off-load facility,''said the admission.   In late August, according to the admission, North toldPoindexter that a representative of Noriega had said the Panamanianleader ``would assassinate the Sandinista leadership for the U.S.government.''   A Panamanian military spokesman on Thursday denied theallegations. Maj. Edgardo Lopez called them ``another cock-and-bullstory of the United States to continue strangling the Panamanianpeople and intensify its defamation campaign against the chief ofour Defense Forces.''   According to the court document, the assassination offer came``in exchange for a promise from the USG (U.S. government) to helpclean up Noriega's image and a commitment to lift the USG ban onmilitary sales to the Panamanian defense forces.''   North told the representative that ``U.S. law forbade''assassinations of foreign leaders and the representative respondedby saying Noriega ``could accomplish many essential things.''   Noriega, said the representative, ``had helped the USG theprevious year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal,'' said theadmission of facts.   British individuals who had run the operation against thearsenal had used a Panamanian civilian ordnance expert, North toldPoindexter, according to the admission.   North told Poindexter that the cost of any operations ``could beborne by Project Democracy,'' the covert private aid network thatNorth had set up with Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, nowco-defendants in the Iran-Contra case.   Poindexter responded that if Noriega had assets in Nicaragua, hecould be helpful. The national security adviser also said that theU.S. government could not be involved in assassination, butPanamanian assistance with sabotage ``would be another story,''according to the admission.   Both the prosecution and North's lawyers have agreed to thewording in the admission of facts. The document was assembled toavoid a protracted legal battle over classified information whichNorth's lawyers want to present in his defense.   The admission is a summary of highly sensitive classifiedmaterial which the government refuses to allow into the courtroom.</TEXT></DOC>
