An unexpected surge in the dollar helped spark the rally, traders said. Also, falling prices of stocks and commodities aroused renewed concern about the economy's health and encouraged investors to seek temporary refuge in Treasury securities.    Early in the day, when the dollar fell, prices of some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds dropped about three-quarters of a point, or about $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. But as the dollar strengthened, Treasury bond prices lurched back up, winding up the day with gains of about a point from late Monday's levels.    The latest 30-year government bond now yields about 9%. That is down from about 9 1/8% Monday and 10 3/8% as recently as Oct. 15. Rates also fell sharply yesterday on short-term Treasury bills, which are especially popular in times of crisis because of their high degree of safety.    The bond rally came as the Treasury sold $9.76 billion of new three-year notes in the first stage of a three-part financing operation this week. The average annual yield was 8.03%, which was what most traders had expected. But it was up from 7.94% at the previous three-year note sale Aug. 11 and was the highest since February of last year.    The three-year notes were highly popular, several traders said. &quot;We saw a lot of folks interested in them,&quot; said S. Waite Rawls III, managing director in charge of securities trading at Chemical Bank. &quot;There's not much risk, and you get a lot better yield than you can on three-month bills,&quot; which were quoted late yesterday at about 5 5/8%.    Still, the volume of bids received by the Treasury was much lower than at the previous sale. The government received $23.27 billion of bids, down from $35.01 billion at the August auction when $9.83 billion of notes were sold.    Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell $9.25 billion of 10-year notes. The notes were quoted in when-issued trading at 8.97% late yesterday. The third and final part of the financing operation is scheduled for tomorrow, with the sale of $4.75 billion of 30-year bonds.    Municipal bond prices also advanced yesterday, although not as much as Treasury issues as traders braced for a $600 million issue of New York City bonds expected soon. Most corporate bonds rose as well.    &quot;There is a whiff of deflation in the air&quot; in the wake of yesterday's sharp declines in stock prices and commodities, said Charles Lieberman, a managing director of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.&quot;Bonds always do well when there is worry about weakness in the world economy.&quot;    Some analysts attributed the bond market selloff and subsequent rebound yesterday to the actions of the Dutch and West German central banks.    Early in the day, rates on some short-term funds in West Germany rose, a move that some traders attributed to Bundesbank policy and that helped depress the dollar and bond prices. But later, the Dutch central bank cut its discount rate a quarter of a percentage point to 4 1/4%, encouraging speculation that the Bundesbank might take similar action soon.    A reduction in official foreign interest rates would help the dollar as well as the bond market, according to many analysts, because the U.S. is so dependent on overseas capital to finance its budget and trade deficits.    &quot;The Dutch discount rate cut was especially surprising because the Dutch typically follow West Germany&quot; in market-related policy moves, said John Lipsky, an international bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. While the Bundesbank still hasn't made it clear it intends to ease credit in the weeks ahead, the West German central bank &quot;may have provided credit to other central banks as they supported the dollar and that would be tantamount to easing,&quot; Mr. Lipsky said.    Whatever the case, speculation is growing that that the Bundesbank, Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve will agree to coordinated interest rate cuts in coming weeks. However, that &quot;may prove to be wishful thinking,&quot; said Mr. Lipsky. &quot;The question now is: After a brief detour, are we headed toward a confidence problem that will push the dollar lower?&quot;    But some analysts say the outlook for stable financial markets is improving. &quot;It's a hasty judgment to say the Louvre accord is dead because the dollar is sharply lower&quot; against the Japanese yen and West German market since mid-October, said Paul McCulley, chief economist at Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association, Beverly Hills, Calif.    The so-called Louvre accord, which was arranged earlier this year to maintain stable exchange rates, &quot;probably will be strengthened because the Bank of Japan, Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve now appear to agree that price stability is a key variable for coordinated monetary policy,&quot; Mr. McCulley said. The absence of inflation pressures, coupled with concern about the stock market collapses here and abroad last month, &quot;should lead to easier credit policies.&quot;    Mr. McCulley said that although the dollar has fallen in the currency markets since October, dollar-denominated commodities prices have also fallen, thus alleviating any inflation pressures. This, he said, &quot;should be a sufficient reason for concluding that monetary policy on a global basis has been too tight.&quot;    The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee met yesterday in Washington D.C. As usual, Fed officials didn't disclose what, if any, changes they made. Many analysts, though, contend that the committee probably voted to ratify its recent credit-easing moves and to authorize additional steps to be implemented later this year if the economy appears weak.    Among the major developments in the credit markets:    --The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose to 98 11/32 from 97 14/32 Monday. At one point early yesterday, it traded as low as 96 5/8. The yield fell to 9.03% from 9.12%. Late last Friday, the issue was quoted at 98 10/32, where the yield was 9.04%.    --The government's 8 5/8% notes due in 1997 climbed to 98 3/32 from 97 21/32, as the yield declined to 8.92% from 8.99%.    --Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds, which fell 7.90 points Monday, rose 10.65 points yesterday to 1243.38. It hovered between 1224.70 and 1246.79.    --Rates on short-term Treasury bill rates fell sharply. The average rate on new 13-week bills declined to 5.61% bid from an average rate of 5.8% at Monday's auction. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills declined to 6.08% bid from the auction average of 6.24%. (On a coupon-equivalent basis, three-month Treasury bills were quoted late yesterday at about 5.72%, down from 5.98% at Monday's auction.)    Among yesterday's large corporate and mortgage-related offerings:    --A $157.2 million issue of Guaranteed Mortgage Corp. collateralized mortgage obligations with yields ranging from 9.19% to 11.05% through underwriters led by Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The issue is a real estate mortgage investment conduit. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $100 million issue of Virginia Electric andamp; Power Co. first and refunding mortgage bonds due November 1994. Virginia Electric is a unit of Dominion Resources Inc. Underwriters led by Prudential-Bache Capital Funding priced the 9 3/8% bonds after competitive bidding at 99 1/8 to yield 9.55%, or 0.76 percentage point more than the Treasury's seven-year note. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of San Francisco Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association mortgage-backed bonds due November 1997. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the 10 3/8% notes at 99.847 to yield 10.40%, or 1.4 percentage points more than the Treasury's new 10-year note in when-issued trading. The issue is expected to receive a triple-A rating from Moody's because of collateral backing the securities.    --A $100 million of Valley National Corp. notes due November 1989. Valley National is a Phoenix, Ariz.-based bank holding company. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the notes at par to yield 9%, or 1.23 percentage points more than the rate on the Treasury's two-year note. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Lomas Mortgage Funding Corp. collateralized mortgage obligations with yields ranging from 9.23% to 11.07% through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The issue is rated triple-A by Sandamp;P. Here are details of the Treasury's auction yesterday of three-year notes:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                          3-Year Notes    Applications                             $23,271,170,000    Accepted bids                             $9,764,885,000    Accepted at low price                                23%    Accepted noncompetitively                   $742,000,000    Average price (Rate)                       99.921(8.03%)    High price (Rate)                         100.000(8.00%)    Low price (Rate)                           99.869(8.05%)    Interest rate                                      8.00%    The notes are dated Nov. 16 and mature Nov. 15, 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
