The crisis has strengthened dramatically the bonds betweenthe U.S. and moderate Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabiaand Egypt, a trend that always makes Israelis wonder aboutAmerica's devotion.</LP><TEXT>   More important, the U.S. now is likely to feel moreobliged to heed those Arab states' pleas to do somethingabout the Palestinian problem. Saudi and Egyptian leaders aresure to argue that their survival in the Arab world isimperiled unless they can demonstrate that their Americanfriends aren't concerned only about guarding oil fields withjet fighters but also about solving Arabs' broader politicalgrievances using diplomacy.   And that could translate into more pressure on Israel fornegotiations over the fate of Palestinians in the West Bankand Gaza Strip.   &quot;Part of the due bill is going to be the desire of thoseArab states we're working with to do something on thePalestinian question,&quot; says Robert Hunter, a NationalSecurity Council adviser on the Middle East under the Carteradministration who is now an analyst at the Center forStrategic and International Studies.   And if the focus does shift toward the Palestinian issuewhen the dust settles, arguments now being used by the Bushadministration to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait may wellcut politically against Israel. &quot;If the U.S. opposes theacquisition of territory by Iraq, it may very well be pushedover time to do more about Israel's occupation of the WestBank and Gaza,&quot; says Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) chairman ofthe House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East.   Sen. William Cohen (R., Me.), ranking Republican on theSenate Intelligence Committee, says &quot;the immediate impact isa positive one for Israel, but in the long run, you're likelyto see a unified Arab effort to bring the focus back to theissue of annexation, including Israel's occupation of Arabland.&quot; Sen. Cohen also says rising oil prices could focusU.S. anger on Israel, and the Arabs could press for a Mideastnuclear arms-control treaty.   And beyond politics, of course, there remains the distinctrisk that Iraq may choose to draw attention away from itsoccupation of Kuwait by launching an attack on Israel,forcing Israel into a fight that could expand into a broadwar with the Arab world.   For the time being, though, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ishanding Israel clear short-term political benefits. It hasdiverted world attention from the search for a solution tothe Palestinian problem -- a search that was creating growingfriction between Israel and the U.S. And the Iraqi move hasadded credence to Israel's longstanding assertion that it isa stable U.S. ally stuck in a &quot;dangerous neighborhood,&quot; Rep.Hamilton says.   There are likely to be some long-term benefits for theJewish state as well. Israel is proving its worth with asteady stream of intelligence for the U.S., which could earnPresident Bush's gratitude. And no matter what the outcome,the Iraqi invasion has cooled the U.S. attraction toPalestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, whohas strongly backed Iraq. Some think these benefits will makethe Iraqi move a net plus for Israel, even after the dustsettles. &quot;One of the things it has done in this country isremind people of the instability of the Arab world andtherefore the strategic importance of Israel,&quot; says GregSchneiders, a Democratic consultant and pollster.   &quot;We have really been the preachers about this Iraqi dangerfor the past 18 months,&quot; Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad saidin an interview. He and other Israeli diplomats here feelcomfortable with Israel's low-profile role; the ambassadorhas seen Secretary of State James Baker twice this weekalready.   But there are a couple of potential flashpoints that couldhave Israel and the U.S. at odds soon, with Israel sorelytempted to raise its profile in the conflict -- against U.S.wishes.   First, Saddam Hussein could &quot;Israelify&quot; his fight bymoving even a token number of tanks or warplanes into Jordan,which separates Iraq from Israel. Israeli leaders haverepeatedly warned, even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, that theentry of Iraqi forces into Jordan would be a &quot;causus belli,&quot;an act that would trigger an Israeli strike at Iraq, Jordanor their forces.   Israel's Air Force commander recently warned both Iraq andJordan that such a move would be &quot;playing with fire.&quot;Israel's leaders consider having Iraqi forces in Jordanunacceptable because they would be in a position for a quickstrike at Israel.   One Israeli official says bluntly that &quot;we want to stayout of it, but once highly important security interests ofIsrael are in danger, I don't think anyone would expect us tostand by.&quot;   President Bush might be distinctly unhappy with anyIsraeli military strike, which could widen or deepen theconflict and color it as a joint U.S.-Israeli assault onArabs. But Israel's hard-line government rarely backs offwhen it is convinced the Jewish state's very survival is onthe line.   Saddam Hussein might also draw Israel into the conflictwith more limited or ambiguous moves. For instance, he couldsend non-combat support units into Jordan, or terrorists intoIsrael itself. If Israel reacted to such lesser moves byhitting Iraq or Jordan, the Arab anger and U.S. irritationmight be even worse.   The second potential for Israeli involvement concernsIraq's growing complex of plants and laboratories dedicatedto producing ballistic missiles and the chemical and nuclearwarheads they would carry. Israel has been itching to destroythese buildings and might use any pretext to do so --including a threatening Iraqi move far from its borders.   The U.S. also sees elimination of the Iraqiadvanced-weapons industry as one goal of its currentconfrontation. But the Pentagon might prefer to do the jobitself, in its own way and at a time of its own choosing,rather than have Israel repeat the daring 1981 air strikethat shattered Iraq's former nuclear-weapons research center.   But even if the standoff with Iraq ends peacefully, therecould be complications for Israel. For starters, SaudiArabia's decision to invite tens of thousands of heavilyarmed U.S. troops to guard the kingdom and Egypt's relatedmove to organize an Arab military force undercut contentionsby Israel's supporters that moderate Arabs would shy awayfrom teaming up openly with the U.S. in a Middle East crisis.   &quot;At first, the Israeli government could take somesatisfaction in these events,&quot; says Samuel Lewis, a formerU.S. ambassador to Israel. &quot;But the demonstration of ourstrategic links to the gulf countries undermines thelongstanding Israeli argument that none of our Arabconnections would ever be useful if they were needed.&quot;   And regardless of whether Iraq or the U.S. prevails in thecurrent showdown, the focus seems likely to shift to thePalestinian question eventually. If Saddam Hussein emergesunscathed, he clearly wants to be seen as undisputed leaderof the Arab world and as champion of the Palestinian cause.Rather than dealing with a moderate over the Palestinianissue, then, Israel would find itself facing the Arab world'stoughest operator. &quot;I think now he'll be more active andenergetic on the Arab-Israeli peace issue because he seeshimself as the Arab leader,&quot; says Richard Murphy, formerassistant secretary of state for the Middle East. &quot;They {theIsraelis} might come to regret not being further ahead&quot; inthe peace process.   And even if the U.S. forces Iraq to back down, the Bushadministration will be under pressure to alleviate Arabdisquiet over the huge U.S. military presence in the PersianGulf by moving on the Arab-Israeli peace issue. &quot;We will beunder some pressure to demonstrate that friendship with theU.S. for a moderate Arab government pays off with a revivalof the peace process as well as checking Saddam Hussein'sambitions,&quot; says William Quandt, a former National SecurityCouncil analyst now with the Brookings Institution.</TEXT></DOC>
