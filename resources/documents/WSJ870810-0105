In fact, the record is quite the opposite. From Charles Carroll's signing of the Declaration of Independence through John Courtney Murray's inspired moral defense of the polis that emerged from it, American Catholics have generally shared Tocqueville's belief in the natural affinity between their faith and the American republic.    Yet almost at the same moment America symbolically vindicated this confidence by putting its first Catholic son in the White House, the nation's Catholic elite had begun what George Weigel describes as &quot;the task of delegitimating the American experiment.&quot; Just how such a complete turnaround could come about within the space of a single generation is brilliantly chronicled by Mr. Weigel in &quot;Tranquillitas Ordinis: The Present Failure and Future Promise of American Catholic Thought on War and Peace&quot; (Oxford University Press, 489 pages, $27.50), arguably the best work on war and peace to come out of the post-Vatican II era. Mr. Weigel agrees that the 20th-century inventions of nuclear weapons and totalitarianism pose new moral problems that were not faced by pre-modern thinkers. But he also argues that abandoning the &quot;moderate realism&quot; that guided the church for some 1,600 years is not the best way to go about solving them.    The &quot;present failure&quot; of the book's subtitle thus is not so much the specific enthusiasms so popular in Catholic circles these days-nuclear arms, Central America, redistributionist economics -- as the sort of shabby thinking that allows the archbishop of Seattle to get away with denouncing the Trident submarines based in his diocese as &quot;the Auschwitz of Puget Sound.&quot; Indeed, the millennialist impatience with practical reasoning in contemporary clerical teaching often gives the impression that morality replaces rather than depends on knowledge. Lost in this unthinking righteousness, says Mr. Weigel, is the larger Catholic perspective on war within &quot;tranquillitas ordinis,&quot; Augustine's definition of a just peace.    The notion of tranquillitas ordinis, Mr. Weigel reminds us, refers to the &quot;dynamic peace of a rightly ordered political community.&quot; It is not merely the static absence of fighting. Drawing heavily on the Jesuit thinker John Courtney Murray, Mr. Weigel concedes that America's experience of freedom bound by constitutional rule is not the sole example of a rightly ordered community -- Augustine, for example, defended Roman rule in his time -- but it is the best history has thus far offered. It is a political system, moreover, where &quot;conflict could be a source of creativity and human progress&quot; instead of an occasion of violence. Such a society has an obligation as well as a right to defend itself. Catholic thinkers who no longer appreciate the virtues of the American arrangement, and the duty to preserve it, became easy prey for the agenda of the radical left.    The catalyst for this &quot;abandonment&quot; of Catholicism's rich heritage on war and peace was the Vietnam War. Using the articles and editorials of the lay magazine Commonweal and the Jesuit weekly America to chart leading Catholic opinion on the war, Mr. Weigel traces the mounting disenchantment with the American polis among the Catholic elite. That disenchantment led many Catholics to adopt an anti-anticommunist posture, and it also fed upon fanciful images of, say, the Viet Cong and the Soviet Union. More recently, this blindness to empirical facts about the nature of the Sandinista regime, says Mr. Weigel, caused the bishops to bungle an opportunity to play a constructive role in the Central American development.    A work of such magnitude, of course, is not without its flaws. For one thing, there is too much repetition of both themes and examples; for another, non-Catholics might find some of the socio-theological jargon rough going. This latter problem is compounded by the title: Like most Latin terms it has the virtue of precision, but it also unfortunately smacks of an inside-the-seminary parochialism bound to circumscribe the audience of a work that deserves a wide hearing. Finally, that Mr. Weigel takes pains to affirm the sincerity of his opponents suggests a feature that has marred so much of the contemporary debate. The best way to acknowledge an opponent's sincerity is to take it for granted by getting on with the argument.    Echoing Karl Rahner's grumble that moral principles do not deliver policy prescriptions like &quot;freshly baked breakfast rolls,&quot; Mr. Weigel argues that they do something far more fundamental: They provide a framework for intelligent discussion between fallible men and women grappling as best they can with greater goods and lesser evils. The author's achievement is that he manages to reconstruct this promising framework from its present tatters.    ---   Mr. McGurn is deputy editorial page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
