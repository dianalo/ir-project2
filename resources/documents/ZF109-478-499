 The speed gained from compiling databasesinto applications is significant and overdue in the Mac market, but ACIUScharges too much for the privilege.andM;By David BeaverandM;Two recent releases from ACIUS Inc., 4th Dimension 2.1 and the 4th DimensionCompiler utility, make 4D an even more powerful development environment forcustom database applications.andM;Version 2.1 is the first major upgrade since 4D 2.0 (see MacWEEK, Nov.andP;  14,1989), though bug fixes have come out of ACIUS at a dizzying rate during thepast year.andP;  The typical user won't notice many of the differences, butdevelopers should be happy.andP;  The upgrade is free to owners of Version 2.0 orlater.andM;It just keeps getting better.andP;  Memory management has been substantiallyreworked in 4D 2.1, and you now can use a database with as little as 512Kbytes of RAM.andP;  Operations are a little slower than they would be in a largerpartition, of course, but keeping a database up and running in MultiFinderwhile you use other applications is now a lot more practical.andM;Another major improvement is in the management of the relationships betweendata tables.andP;  New automatic functions take care of many standardrelational-integrity problems, such as prohibiting deletion of customers withopen orders.andP;  These controls will be a real boon to the developer who has hadto code these restrictions manually in previous versions.andM;ACIUS always has been responsive to developer feedback, and Version 2.1 ischock-full of new features that make 4D development just a little bit easier.andO;For instance, various types of commands in the programming language can bedisplayed in different colors to allow easier debugging, and double-clickshortcuts let the programmer open and close procedures and layouts morequickly.andM;The most important internal change in 4D, however, is support for add-inmodules.andP;  ACIUS already has announced 4D Write, 4D Draw and 4D Calc -- add-inmodules that have the features of low-end, stand-alone applications and arecapable of exchanging data with 4D databases interactively.andP;  These modulesare not yet available, but databases that manage large graphic images orfully formatted documents have great potential.andM;4D Compiler.andP;  More than these new features, the thing developers have beenwaiting for is the 4D Compiler.andP;  A separate product, the 4D Compilertransforms all procedures and scripts in a custom 4D database into fast Macmachine language.andM;The biggest complaint about 4D always has been its performance, and the 4DCompiler makes a big difference here.andP;  But speed is a complex issue.andP;  The 4Ddatabase commands, such as search and sort, have always been compiled, andfor these activities, the bottlenecks are still the speed of your network,your server and your Mac.andP;  The performance improvement you'll see with the 4DCompiler depends entirely on the nature of your application.andP;  If you'rerunning long, complex procedures or processing a lot of data in memory, thedifference can be dramatic; if you have a simple database application, theimprovements may not be large.andP;  Our tests showed that complex, real-worldoperations and reports worked about four times faster when compiled.andM;Application development.andP;  The other major benefit of the 4D Compiler is thecapability to turn a database into a stand-alone application.andP;  The 4DCompiler effectively merges the 4D Runtime engine with your final database,and even gives you your own icon and About information.andP;  The 4D Compiler isquite nice as a development environment and works closely with 4D.andO;Alternately, you can edit and compile a database easily in MultiFinder.andO;After an unsuccessful compile, any procedures containing errors can be openedautomatically, with the error highlighted and explained.andM;There's a whole new art to working with the 4D Compiler, and the environmenthas its quirks and bugs.andP;  Some of these can get a developer in serioustrouble; if you're doing a lot of work in 4D, you'd be well advised to keepclose watch on the ACIUS forum on CompuServe, where you can see what troubleother people have gotten into.andM;Much as we like the 4D Compiler, we can't avoid criticizing ACIUS for theprice.andP;  Yes, we understand the economics of a specialized product like this,but we don't think that such a necessary utility should be priced at so muchmore than the core product.andP;  4D developers we talked with grudgingly acceptedthe price, as well as the unfortunate and unpredictable key-diskcopy-protection scheme, but they weren't happy about either.andM;Conclusions.andP;  There's been a large gap in the spectrum of Mac developmentenvironments between programmable databases like 4D and Omnis and compiledlanguages like MacApp and C. The databases are much easier to program butalso much slower, and we blame this for the Mac's relative dearth of databaseapplications targeted to specific vertical markets.andP;  Version 2.1 and the 4DCompiler help 4D narrow this gap, making it a viable development environmentfor a new class of specialized applications -- a kind the Macintosh reallyneeds.andM;ACIUS Inc. is located at 10351 Bubb Road, Cupertino, Calif.andP;  95014; (408)252-4444.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
