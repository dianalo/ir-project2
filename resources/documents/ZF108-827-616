DEC is also contemptuous of IBM's attempts to haveincreased compatibility within its systems and wonders aloud how an MS-DOSuser gets up to ESA.andM;- o -andM;As for DEC's own mainframe offering the VAX 9000, product marketing managerRich Whitman told Reuters that he has back orders for the machine totalling$400m: he also said that 32% of VAX 9000 sales to date have been intogreenfield sites or had displaced competitive products; however, he declinedto say how many of the things had shipped in the company's first fiscalquarter, simply stating that DEC is shipping &quot;multiple&quot; VAX 9000 210 and 410models each week.andM;- o -andM;US Sprint Communications Co, part of United Telecommunications Inc has woncontracts totalling $127m in value: National Carriers' Buyers Network in theUS has signed a two year $78m deal, American Healthcare Systems has signed upfor a three-year $36m contract, while ITT Corp is paying $10.8m for athree-year agreement and Fireman's Fund Mortgage Corp adds the final $2.2mwith a two-year agreement for that sum.andM;- o -andM;Northern Telecom and its Austrian PBX licensee Kapsch AG have donated a$70,000 Meridian SL-1 system to provide communications services to EastEurope's first Regional Environment Centre which opened in Hungary last week:the SL-1 PBX will handle both voice and data communications, with access tothe public X.25 network, for the Centre which is housed in a 200-year-oldconverted Silk Mill in Budapest, so it may monitor the environment.andM;- o -andM;IBM claims that its PS/2 business has been growing faster than the market asa whole this year, but to keep the pot boiling in the US for the vital fourthquarter, it has launched a Grand Scale Sale promotion that runs out onJanuary 15, 1991, under which it will offer six applications free with PS/2Models 25 through 65, and coupons for discounts on some printers: the sixprograms, which have a total list price of over $600, are the LotusWorksintegrated spreadsheet, graphics, communications, word processing, spellchecking, and database; the Quicken financial management program, whichprints cheques, manages cash, assets and liabilities, generates tax reportsand performs calculations; the PFS: First Publisher 3.0 desktop publishingprogram; the Calendar Creator Plus 3.02 diary program; PGA Tour Golf, a threedimensional simulation of world-class courses on which golf professionalsplay; and Lotus Magellan 2.0 file navigation program for finding your waythrough the other five programs; IBM also is offering a $150 rebate whenusers buy the PS/2 Model 30-286, Model 50Z or Model 60 and an IBM operatingsystem, and a $300 rebate on the Models 55SX or 65SX with operating system;they can also get $75 off a Proprinter or LaserPrinter E, and $150 on the IBMLaserprinter.andM;- o -andM;Sema Group Plc has bought Bredon, Glocestershire-based Panther Systems Ltdfor an undisclosed su: Panther specialises in selling ICL's OMACmanufacturing software product to customers such as parent STC, Racal, GECand ICL itself.andM;- o -andM;General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services Inc, part of General DynamicsCorp has signed with GEC to launch a Japanese communications satellite for anundisclosed sum: the satellite will be launched in April from Cape Canaveral,Florida.andM;- o -andM;Butler Cox Plc shares nosedived to 75 pence, shedding 103 pence after itreported its interims - page 5.andM;- o -andM;US company Laser Computer Inc reckons its going to give IBM a run for itsmoney on the PS/1 line, when Laser launches its Laser Pal 286 later thisweek: Laser spokesman Grant Dahlke reckons Laser Pal will competehead-to-head with the PS/1 but will offer the Ensemble graphical interfacefrom Geoworks, which Dahlke says has the look and feel of a Macintosh; Palwill sell for $2,000, positioning it against the top end PS/1 models - it isbased on the 80286 chip but offers switchable operating speeds of 6MHz and12MHz whereas the PS/1 offers a single speed of 10MHz; Pal may well face morecompetition when Apple introduces its low end Mac models.andM;- o -andM;Looks like the Swiss are taking over at Leica Plc, formerly CambridgeInstruments: Dr Terence Gooding has quit as chairman and chief executive tobe replaced by Dr Stephan Schmidheiny as non-executive charman and MarkusRauh as chief executive of the Anglo-Swiss group.andM;- o -andM;Motorola Inc's shares are being downgraded by analysts who expect a weakeningin the company's semiconductor and comms business due to revised forecastsfor the growth of the chip market next year and the softening US economy -the shares fell 11% to $61.50 on the news.andM;- o -andM;Apple Computer has cut prices on its Mac IIci models by up to 20%.andM;- o -andM;Vets may be sturdy animal medics that do unmentionable things like buryingtheir arms up to the elbow up the rear ends of cows on prime time televisionon this side of the water, but over in the US of A, vets are veteran fightingmen, returned soldiers, whose welfare is looked after by the VeteransAdministration - &quot;Don't forget, hire the vet&quot; ran the advertising pitchbeseeching employers to give jobs to boys back from 'nam - and by allaccounts, the VA looks after them very well: seems that its kindly computersin Washington have a tendency to go on paying their benefits long after theyhave no need of them - the VA computers send the cheques to the bank'scomputer that holds the deceased's account, and the cash is added to thedeparted vet's estate, which can make the fading away of an old soldier avery long drawn out affair indeed - like 10 years in some instances.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
