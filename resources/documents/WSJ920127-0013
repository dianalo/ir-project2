The mugging that ensued cost him a chippedtooth, a broken arm and an injured eye.   Had the jazz bassist been attacked in his nativeCalifornia, it would have rated at most a brief mention inthe local papers. But the bizarre incident happened in asuburb of Tokyo, Mr. Jackson's home for the past six yearsand a city often described as the safest in the world.Attacks on prominent foreigners are so rare that a localEnglish daily, the Japan Times, devoted a lengthy article tothe mugging.</LP><TEXT>   Residents of this city of 8.4 million walk the streetslate at night without a thought of danger. Locks are flimsyby U.S. standards. &quot;Most foreigners in Japan drop the kind ofdefenses you normally have in America,&quot; says the 44-year-oldMr. Jackson, known to jazz fans for years of work withkeyboard artist Herbie Hancock.   There isn't any evidence that Mr. Jackson, anAfrican-American, was attacked because of his nationality orhis race. And while there have been sporadic episodes ofmuggings recently in Tokyo and several attempted kidnappingsoutside schools, there is no evidence of a major crime wave.In fact, statistics suggest that crime has ebbed in the pastfew years.   Yet for many foreigners in Tokyo, the mugging of Mr.Jackson was shocking. For one thing, the attack was only thebeginning of Mr. Jackson's troubles; he subsequently haddifficulties getting a hospital to treat him for his wounds,and a police officer suggested to his Japanese wife, Yoshiko,that she not inform the media of the event. These subsequentincidents touched a nerve, for foreigners frequently find itdifficult to get adequate medical care in Tokyo, and areoccasionally annoyed by a tendency in Japan to sweep certainproblems under the rug.   For another thing, the sequence of events leading up toMr. Jackson's attack demonstrated that when violence doesflare in this tightly controlled society, it can do so with avehemence surprising even to crime-jaded Americans. Theincident began when Mr. Jackson came upon a car full of youngtoughs who had stopped in the middle of a narrow street,preventing his van from passing. A couple of them turned andpointed at Mr. Jackson, laughing. He honked.   &quot;Honking your horn often leads to trouble,&quot; says ToshiMotoyoshi, deputy police chief in Ichikawa. &quot;The guy in frontgets mad. Sometimes, it escalates to murder.&quot; The danger isparticularly great when the car in front is filled withmembers of the young hot-rod gangs known as bosozoku or theolder gangsters known as yakuza.   After Mr. Jackson leaned on his horn, three men got out ofthe car and moved around toward his van. As alarming as thismight have been in the U.S., the possibility of beingattacked &quot;was so far out of my mind, I truly thought it was agame,&quot; like switch-the-driver or some other schoolboy prank,says Mr. Jackson.   Instead, one of the men went for Mr. Jackson's door, andthe six-foot-two, 286-pound jazzman reacted by forcing thedoor out into the man to fend him off. As Mr. Jackson emergedfrom his van, however, he was &quot;cold-cocked from behind&quot; byanother man, he says. Then, as he lay on the ground, one ofhis assailants tore off Mr. Jackson's glasses and poked himthe eyes. Mr. Jackson was beaten about the head with whatpolice say apparently was some kind of club.   Police were alerted to the fracas by a resident at 2:30a.m., but by the time they responded, no one was at thescene.   Mr. Jackson had recovered consciousness and climbed intohis still-idling van. &quot;After that was a blur,&quot; he says, inwhich he managed to drive the couple of kilometers to hisstudio. He collapsed inside, and didn't wake up until late inthe morning. He then went to a nearby private hospital wherehe had once stayed during a bout with pneumonia. There, Dr.Keiko Okuda had Mr. Jackson X-rayed, and placed a splint onhis fractured forearm.   What transpired next is a matter of some debate. Dr. Okudafirst denied and later confirmed that she had told YoshikoJackson that the chief doctor feared for the hospital's imageif police or gangsters should show up. But she insists thatshe said it because she misinterpreted a vague expression ofdisapproval by the chief doctor, whose main concerns in factwere, she says, a lack of beds and of pertinent specialists.The chief doctor, Hideki Okubo, insists for his part that hewouldn't hesitate to admit a patient who had been in a fightif appropriate specialists were on hand. Mr. Jacksoneventually was admitted to a university hospital, and says heis pleased with his treatment there.   But Mrs. Jackson, angered by the encounter at thehospital, told a police detective initially assigned to herhusband's case that she wanted to inform her friends in thenews media about the incident. Mrs. Jackson says thedetective advised against it, because he probably would bedeluged with questions he couldn't answer and she might getunwelcome calls as well. But that only fired up Mrs. Jacksoneven more, and she eventually told the story to a friend atthe national Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which carried a storyon Dec. 18. (The detective has since been transferred, andMr. Motoyoshi says it isn't police policy to discourage anycrime victim from speaking to the media.)   Mr. Motoyoshi says the police are looking into possiblebosozoku suspects, but have no firm leads yet.   Mr. Jackson is expected to make a complete recovery, andhopes to be playing his bass again by April or May.</TEXT></DOC>
