In a lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission charges thethree men and an investment company formed by two of them withunlawful trading in 15 stocks from March 1984 through June 1985 aspart of an international trading ring.   The SEC seeks alleged illicit profits and penalties totaling inthe millions of dollars in the suit filed Monday in U.S. DistrictCourt in Manhattan.   The defendants allegedly received non-public information fromBernhard Meier, who was Levine's account representative at Bank LeuInternational, a Bahamian bank through which Levine ran his 1980-86illegal trading operation.   In some prior cases, people who received inside informationsecond-hand have not been charged. But the lawsuit claims that thethree men ``knew or should have known'' they were using non-publicinformation about pending mergers or takeovers.   The complaint is the first against parties who allegedlyreceived information through Meier, who in 1986 settled chargeswith the SEC and was barred for life from the securities industry.   Levine, a former Wall Street banker, pleaded guilty to violatingsecurities laws and returned $11.6 million in illegal profits inJune 1986. His admissions spawned dozens of civil and criminalscharges in the continuing Wall Street insider trading investigation.   Levine, 36, who made millions trading on inside information onthe stocks of companies targeted for takeovers, was paroled from afederal prison last year. He has said he has formed a privateconsulting firm in mergers and acquisitions.   The defendants are Brian S. Campbell, 32, of New York, whoworked at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. from 1982 to February 1985, and thenat Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. until June 1987; Kevin Barry,33, a former New York corporate lawyer now practicing in upstateNew York; and Carlos Zubillaga, 39, a Venezuelan citizen who workedin Merrill's New York and Caracas offices and resigned in April1986.   Also named is BCM Management Inc., a real estate investmentvehicle formed by Campbell and Barry in 1984.   The complaint details five of the 15 deals, listing $452,175 inalleged illegal profits made by the defendants, friends and familymembers.   Under federal securities laws, the SEC also is demanding threetimes the total in penalties. SEC attorney Therese Pritchard saidunspecified profits were made in the 10 other deals but not listedin the lawsuit.   According to the lawsuit, Meier placed many of Levine's ordersthrough accounts managed by Campbell. It also states that Campbelland Barry had separate stock dealings with Meier.   Campbell also traded securities using inside information throughan account he shared with Zubillaga, the suit claims. The two hadan agreement to split profits and losses on the trades, it says.   The lawsuit also claims that Campbell helped Meier and Levinetry to deceive the SEC after they learned of the government'sinvestigation, providing reports purported to be stock analysesbased on public information.   It also says Meier destroyed documents showing that he hadprovided money used by Campbell and Barry in some real estateinvestments to further the alleged deception.   Barry Fallick, Campbell's lawyer, said his client would ``fullylitigate the matters.'' An attorney for Barry, Michael Pelletiere,declined to comment. SEC lawyers said they would attempt to servethe suit on Zubillaga in Venezuela.   The 15 stocks listed as involved in the alleged illegal tradingare: G.D.
