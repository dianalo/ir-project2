In the past six years, Congresshas forced the Federal Communications Commission to give awayan estimated $30 billion to $40 billion worth of licenses tooperate cellular-phone systems. The winners are a few favoredcorporations and speculators; the losers are the taxpayers.   The cellular-phone industry is booming. The number ofsubscribers could grow from 3.5 million now to 20 million bydecade's end, once car makers decide to install cellularphones as regular features. You'd think Congress would havecharged for these license gold mines by holding an auction.After all, it already charges for mineral, grazing and timberrights. Auctions for offshore oil and gas leases alone havebrought in $55 billion over the past 30 years.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, the cellular lottery scam came about like this.In 1984 Congress abandoned the awarding of cellular rightsthrough arbitrary &quot;public interest&quot; hearings. But its60-year-old theory on the electromagnetic band remains: It'spublic property and can't be sold. Rep. John Dingell,chairman of the House Commerce Committee, pushes throughfrequent amendments barring any use of auctions. So instead,the FCC gives away spectrum space by lottery.   The cellular lotteries led to perverse windfalls for afew, lucky individuals. Rural licenses are now worth upwardof $100 a person. Not surprisingly, some 280,000 applicationsflooded in just for the 428 rural markets. But &quot;applicationsengineering&quot; firms charged only $5,000 for someone to enterevery lottery in partnership with others, and thoseapplicants stood a 50-50 chance of winning part of a license.Some congressional offices kindly helped favored constituentsthrough the maze of paper work.   Of course, most winners have no interest or expertise inoperating a cellular system. They sell their winning&quot;tickets&quot; to large companies building nationwide cellularnetworks. Many lottery winners realized instant windfalls.One couple in Ovid, Michigan, sold a license to McCawCommunications for $4 million, and then won another worth $10million.   Both the Reagan and Bush administrations have pleaded withCongress to end such giveaways to a well-heeled, lucky few.Last year, the Bush FCC proposed using auctions to assign sixcurrently unassigned megahertz of the spectrum to cellularusers. The sales would bring in at least $3.3 billion overtwo years. Congress refused to act, so the FCC recently hadto assign four of the unused megahertz for air-to-groundtelephone users. It will collect zero revenue from them.   Congress may be about to repeat its folly. In June, aHouse committee approved a bill by Rep. Dingell to makeavailable for cellular use 200 megahertz now reserved for thegovernment. The potential revenue from an auction system isenormous, but Rep. Dingell still doesn't think it's worthgiving up political control of the spectrum.   Other countries aren't so foolish. In New Zealand, aleft-wing Labor government recently privatized the spectrumby leasing it to firms on a long-term basis. This giveslessees a virtual property right; they can, for example, usetheir part of the spectrum for whatever use they think best.   It's now clear that the technical justifications forgovernment ownership of the electromagnetic spectrum arespecious and outdated. Congress's cellular-phone giveawaymakes it imperative to begin questioning government controlof the airwaves on basic grounds of fiscal common sense.</TEXT></DOC>
