The Soviet-sponsored government said the soldiers killed at least287 guerrillas, wounded 238 and captured tanks, armored personnelcarriers and ammunition. It gave army casualties as only four dead.   Each side in the 11-year-old war customarily exaggerates theother's losses and minimizes its own.   ``This is our biggest offensive ... since the Soviet troopwithdrawal'' completed Feb. 15, said presidential spokesman SarwarYourish. ``Our aim is to push the rebels toward the Pakistaniborder.''   He said the army drove the insurgents back on the south andsoutheast of Jalalabad, capital of Nangarhar province, which hasbeen under guerrilla siege since March 7.   Jalalabad is 75 miles east of Kabul and 45 miles from Pakistan,where most of the guerrillas are based.   Afghan air force jets bombed rebel positions in and aroundJalalabad for a second day and guerrilla rocket attacks on the citycontinued, Yourish said.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said soldiersadvanced toward a guerrilla base at Torkham, six miles from thePakistani border, after overrunning insurgent positions aroundJalalabad.   The Torkham base at the foot of the Khyber Pass, a major routefor supplies from Pakistan, is a staging area for attacks onJalalabad.   In Pakistan, the guerrilla-run Afghan Information andDocumentation Center acknowledged the loss of some positions nearJalalabad.   An Afghan pilot landed his Soviet-made ground attack fighter inPeshawar, Pakistan, and sought asylum Thursday, Pakistani officialssaid.   A Pakistan air force official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the pilot of the Sukhoi-22 jet ``refused to bombardmujahedeen positions and fled to Pakistan.'' Afghan guerrillas callthemselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.   On Monday, two Afghan helicopters landed in Pakistan and theircrews sought political asylum.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1968 and Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. An estimated115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan when the U.N.-mediatedwithdrawal began on May 15, 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
