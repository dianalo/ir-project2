It was the second day in a row Arab guerrillas from Lebanon haveclashed with soldiers inside Israel. The new attack occurred abouttwo miles from Tuesday's border clash, in which two Israelisoldiers and three Palestinian guerrillas were killed, militarysources said.   It was not immediately clear if the guerrillas infiltratedIsrael today or came with the group that entered from LebanonTuesday.   In Beirut, George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine, one of eight factions in the PalestineLiberation Organization; and the Lebanese Communist Party, headedby George Hawi, claimed responsibility for today's attack.   The army closed roads in northern Israel and ordered women andchildren in the dozen settlements north of Kiryat Shmona to stayindoors while troops searched for the guerrillas by foot andhelicopter, police in northern Israel said.   The guerrillas, armed with light weapons and other handgrenades, evaded troops for three hours until they were discoveredand killed in a nearby dry riverbed, military sources said.   The truck driver, Danny Dahan, was attacked at ``TankJunction,'' where a ruin of a Soviet tank used by the Syrians inthe 1967 Middle East war stands as a memorial, the sources said. Hewas shot in the hand and taken to nearby Safed Hospital where hewas operated on, a doctor at the hospital said.   After the truck attack, Israeli men from the settlements wereordered to take up arms and go to assigned guard posts, said ZviYuval, 37, from Kibbutz Senir about three miles south of theborder. During the search he heard continuous gunfire, includingshots from helicopters, Yuval said in a telephone interview.   ``We fear there will be more attacks this summer. The vegetationis like a jungle,'' giving guerrillas places to hide, Yuval said.   It was the 12th penetration or infiltration attempt since Nov.26, when a lone guerrilla landed a hang glider in northern Israeland killed six soldiers before he was shot to death himself.   Earlier in the day, a U.N. source who spoke on condition ofanonymity said the the army fired artillery and flares early todaynear where the Israeli soldiers and guerrillas clashed Tuesday.   Army radio reported explosions in the area overnight, but itgave no details.   Also today, a 14-year-old Palestinian girl died of woundssuffered a day earlier after Israeli troops opened fire on Arabprotesters in a village in the occupied West Bank, army officialssaid.   The death brought to 174 the number of Arabs killed inanti-occupation unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whichIsrael seized in the 1967 Middle East war. Two Israelis also havedied since the rioting began Dec. 8.   In Syria, Palestinian officials said Yasser Arafat, chairman ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization, plans to escalate the5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. Theofficials spoke on condition of anonymity after Arafat finishedtalks with Syrian President Hafez Assad and headed for Iraq.   In Beirut, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestineclaimed responsibility for the border attack on Tuesday. Thestatement was accompanied by what the group said were photographsof the three slain guerrillas.   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the army's northern command, said theguerrillas had planned to attack Israeli settlements. IsraelTelevision said they had carried a map of settlements in the area.   The army said Tuesday the soldiers spotted the infiltrators'footprints and tracked them. It said the guerrillas hid in thickbushes inside Israel and opened fire when the army unit approached.But an earlier report from a Lebanese police spokesman said theguerrillas were ``apparently ambushed before launching across-border raid into northern Israel.''   In Arab east Jerusalem, most stores remained closed aftermerchants voted Tuesday night to extend a strike through Thursdayto protest the arrest of 14 shopkeepers who violated police orders.   Arab reports identified the dead Palestinian girl as ArishIsmail Daoud Adik.   The reports said two dozen soldiers in five jeeps on Tuesdayentered Kufr Dik, a village 20 miles southwest of Nablus, to breakup a demonstration by teen-agers who blocked roads with stones andhung outlawed Palestinian flags from utility poles.   Troops chased the teen-agers to the yard of the village mosqueand opened fire and Miss Adik was struck by a bullet to the head,the reports said.   The army's chief education officer, Brig. Gen. Nehemiah Dagan,also said today Israeli soldiers commit an average of 200``excessive acts'' against Palestinians in the occupied territorieseach month.   Dagan, in remarks to Israeli educators, did not elaborate onwhat he meant by excessive acts but said he was concerned about howfive months of confrontation with Palestinian protesters wouldaffect young soldiers' moral values.   The soldier ``stands there with a club in his hand and gets arock thrown in his face,'' the daily Hadashot quoted Dagan assaying. ``Two thousand years of life in exile pour into the handholding that club.''</TEXT></DOC>
