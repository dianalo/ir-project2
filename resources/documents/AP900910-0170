Ms. Bhutto called the charges an act of desperation anddeclared, ``We will not take this lying down.'' She said thegovernment was trying to disqualify her and her party from the Oct.24 elections.   She was charged before a special, one-judge court set up inKarachi to try cases of official graft and possibly bar candidatesfrom the voting.   Judge Wajihuddin Ahmed will decide this week whether to acceptthe charges and serve formal notice to Ms. Bhutto. She haspreviously said she will not appear. If she refuses, legal expertssay she could be arrested.   In addition, the caretaker government said it plans to filecriminal charges against her.   Ms. Bhutto on Monday went to file her nomination papers as acandidate representing Lyari, the sprawling slum in central Karachithat is home to 1 million people. But after hearing of the charges,she postponed filing until Tuesday.   Ms. Bhutto won the Lyari seat in parliament in the November 1988election that installed her as the first woman to lead a modernMoslem nation.   Later Monday, she told a crowded news conference at her home onthe Arabian Sea that the caretaker government and the man whoousted her, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, were trying to disqualifyher and her Pakistan People's Party from the elections.   ``We want to take part in the election, and we won't give in,''she said. ``We will not take this lying down, and we won't leavethe field.''   She said the People's Party had formed an alliance with threesmaller centrist parties to fight the election under the banner ofthe People's Democratic Alliance.   ``We might not have been the perfect government, and we mighthave made mistakes,'' she said. ``But compared with the caretakergovernment and the previous government, we were much more honestand competent.''   According to the charges, the 37-year-old former prime ministerabused her power by appointing a consulting firm to oversee a powerproject financed by the Asian Development Bank. She is also chargedwith awarding a lucrative contract to a British company to exportcotton at prices substantially below the international market rate.No other details were given.   If convicted, she could be barred not only from next month'selection but from politics for seven years.   Ms. Bhutto's lawyer, former Interior Minister Aitzaz Ahsan, saidthe charges were ``a political vendetta'' and would be challengedin court.   ``Ishaq Khan is frightened of her popular support and fearful ofvictory. He is desperately seeking to disqualify her to prevent herreturn.''   Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government onAug. 6, citing widespread corruption, abuse of power and politicalincompetence.   The caretaker government, comprised largely of Ms. Bhutto'sopponents, has spent much of the past month trying to portray heradministration as the most corrupt in Pakistan's 43-year historyand to weaken her party's electoral chances. At least five formerCabinet ministers and Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, havebeen charged with corruption.   Despite allegations made daily in Pakistani newspapers, thegovernment has provided no solid proof to back up the claims.   Western diplomats have said Pakistan could lose hundreds ofmillions of dollars in economic and military aid if Ms. Bhutto isvictimized or if the elections are rigged.   Even though she now has been charged, many people are skepticalabout the government's willingness to actually put her on trial.   Although most Pakistanis showed little sympathy when she wasdismissed, a trial could bring back memories of the eventsfollowing the 1977 military overthrow of her father, Prime MinisterZulfikar Ali Bhutto, and his hanging two years later.</TEXT></DOC>
