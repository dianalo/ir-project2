But consumer electronics technologyaccelerated in the 1980s and '90s.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D HEARD EVERYTHING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  AUDIO / VIDEO  </MEMO><TEXT>     Now we have to worry not only about what gadgets to buy, but whether thosegadgets will become outdated before we've had a chance to whittle down thecredit-card balance.;    Brace yourself. Here comes another example.;    Atthe Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Sony showed hundreds ofretailers its latest home entertainment introduction: a new digital musicsystem that's smaller than a CD and will enable you to record music onto2.5-inch discs. It's expected to be available in late 1992.;    Called theMini Disc system, it will use discs that are about half the size ofconventional compact discs. They'll be able to record up to 74 minutes ofmusic, about the same amount that you'd find on a regular 5-inch compactdisc.;    This is the second new audio format consumers can expect within thenext year.;    Philips N.V. of the Netherlands already has announced plans tointroduce its own mini music system, dubbed DCC.;    Both come on the heels ofdigital audio tape (DAT).;    After years of legal wrangling between the musicand the electronics industries, DAT finally was introduced into the UnitedStates, only to be greeted by indifference by consumers, largely because ofits expensive price tag ($1,200 or more for a DAT player).;    So, with thatfailure under its belt, why is Sony launching yet another mini music system?;   &quot;When the Walkman came out, it allowed you to take good sound wherever youwent,&quot; says a Sony spokesman. &quot;But there were some things people wereunsatisfied with, such as disability, stability and the rapid access of acomputer disc.&quot;;    Sony hopes its Mini Disc system will meet those interests.The system is targeted for in-car use and for those who like to take theirmusic on the go. It's small, which is a plus for crowded dashboards. It's alsonot likely to skip, potholes or no, because even if its optical pickup isjolted off track, the unit continues playing for about three seconds byproducing data stored from the disc. After about three seconds, the opticalscanner should be able to get back on track.;    Because it uses disctechnology, the system should sound better than tape, but to the verydiscerning ear, not quite as good as a conventional CD.;    It's far too earlyto know whether the public will find this new music system any more appealingthan its DAT precursor.;    Sony isn't saying how much it plans to charge forits new music system. Philips is expected to charge between $300 and $500.;   Another wild card is what pre-recorded music will be available for the newmusic formats. And that doesn't even get into the confusion factor.;    Withso many formats spinning around out there, consumers are understandablyconfused and skittish about putting down their money for a system that couldbe outdated within a few years.;    &quot;I don't know if there is a market for itor not,&quot; says David Lachenbruch, an editor with TV Digest, a prominentelectronics trade publication.;    For the moment, Lachenbruch says the bestadvice is to do nothing and watch the Mini Disc rollout from afar.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEPHEN ADVOKAT, Knight-Ridder Newspapers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910614  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  26  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  576  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 14, 199100166113,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
