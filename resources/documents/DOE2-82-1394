It has already been ratified by some of the 43 signatorystates. New finds such as the global thinning of the ozone shield, upto 10% depending on latitude and season, are causing some governmentsto press for a tightening of the agreement and an extension of the listof chlorine-containing, longer-living substances which need to be reduced.Scientific and public discussion is now turning increasingly to the farmore difficult subject of 'increased greenhouse effect in the atmospherefrom trace gases'. More difficult, because remedial measures need toreach much more deeply into society. For in order to reduce the additionalgreenhouse effect an equal challenge is demanded of developed and lessdeveloped countries, industry, the energy supply industry and agriculture.The trace gas carbon dioxide (CO/sub 2/) plays a major role, having risenfrom a proportion of 280 millionths in volume (ppm) before industrialisationto 350 ppm now.</TEXT></DOC>
