 Adobe's release of Type I specifications opened the door, andAltsys, creator of a variety of typo-graphical programs for the Mac, marchedthrough that door with Metamorphosis, a $295 font utility.andM;ABOUT-FACE Metamorphosis is a simple program - in both interface andfunction.andP;  It does only one thing: convert the characters of any Type I (thisincludes all Adobe typefaces) or Type 3 font into editable PostScriptoutlines.andP;  You can save converted fonts in three formats: as a Fontographerdatabase, as a Fontographer Type 3 printer font, and as EPS outlines that youcan manipulate in Adobe Illustrator or FreeHand.andM;The program can run on a Mac Plus with only one disk drive, but Altsysrecommends that you use a 68030 machine and a hard-disk drive.andP;  You must alsohave a PostScript printer connected to your Mac.andM;FACE-TO-FACE The interface is like that of FontLiner, a very limitedfirst-genera-tion font-converter program, and it should prove easy to master- even for the dullest of dullards.andP;  When you launch Metamorphosis, an emptywindow called the Font List appears.andP;  You add fonts you want to convert tothe window with the Open Font file or Open Installed Fonts command on theFile menu.andM;Once you've put together a font list, you can set various options before youactually start the conversion.andP;  The All Characters option lets you specifywhether all 256 characters in a given font, including some esotericdiacritical marks and symbols, should be converted.andP;  If the option isn'tselected, Metamorphosis will convert only the font's 128 main alpha-numericcharacters.andM;You can then specify that the program convert the fonts into one, two, or allthree of the supported formats.andP;  The Fontographer Database option creates aFontographer source file, where you can customize the font withinFontographer and then generate Type 3 printer fonts.andP;  Although Fontographeralready lets you create composite fonts that reference Adobe fonts, creatingthe Type 3 source file in Metamorphosis first has its advantages.andP;  The sourcefile lets you edit the actual outlines before you create printer fonts - youcan't ordinarily do this when you create composite fonts.andP;  A practicalexample: Some European languages need to accent the letter j with acircumflex or grave accent.andP;  In a composite font, you can paste the accentover the j but the dot remains.andP;  But you can delete the dot if you work witha Type 3 source file.andP;  The result is a dotless j and a cleaner, moreprofessional look.andM;The Fontographer PostScript option creates Type 3 printer fonts.andP;  The manualsays this lets you use Adobe fonts with programs such as QuarkXPress, but nowthat ATM is out, allowing you to make smooth large-sized screen fonts, thisoption seems irrelevant.andM;The EPS Format option saves the characters of a converted font as editablegraphic outlines in an Adobe Illustrator 1.1 file.andM;Once you've made all your decisions, you must fire up your PostScript printerand select Generate from the File menu.andP;  And then you wait.andP;  Metamorphosisconverts the listed fonts into the formats you've specified and downloads thefonts to the printer, where the actual outline capture takes place.andP;  The newfiles are all placed automatically in a common folder.andP;  You can put theprocess in the background under MultiFinder, as each font can take severalminutes.andM;Metamorphosis displays some minor divergences from the usual Mac interface.andO;Both the Open Font file and Open Installed Fonts commands should include anellipsis, as they lead to dialog boxes.andP;  And you cannot add a font to thefont list by double-clicking on a name in the Select Font dialog box.andM;THE BOTTOM LINE Metamorphosis is a handy tool, both for type designers whoneed to work with Adobe outlines and for artists who want to treat type asgraphics.andP;  But it should have been incorporated into Fontographer rather thanmarketed as a rather pricey stand-alone package.andP;  If you haven't alreadyinvested in Altsys' product line, I recommend that you take a look atLetraset's FontStudio instead.andP;  That fine product is the equivalent ofAltsys' Font-ographer, Family Builder, and Metamorphosis - all rolled intoone.andP;  And you'll save yourself some money: It costs $595, versus $890 for theAltsys triumvirate.andP;  Also, ImageClub is about to introduce Evolution, a typeutility that will do everything Metamorphosis does plus convert Type 3 intoType 1 fonts that will work with ATM.andP;  Slated for release at the end of May,it will cost only $99.andP;  Evolution has been delayed several times, which mayindicate some problems, but look for the product anyway.andP;  Its release willundoubtedly force Altsys to rethink its pricing and add to Metamorphosis'functionality.andM;[As this issue went to press, Altsys announced Metamorphosis version 1.5,which reads Type 1 fonts, as well as Type 3 fonts created with Fontographer,directly from disk.andP;  More importantly, version 1.5 can convert Type 3 fontsinto the ATM-compatible Type 1 format.andP;  The beta version of 1.5 that wastested performed flawlessly.andP;  - GWI</TEXT></DOC>
