Charles Percy fails to mention that since 1981 the Saudis have bought $2.9 billion worth of military hardware from the U.S., and vast amounts from Western Europe, presumably to protect the kingdom and the Gulf shipping lanes from precisely the kind of harassment now inflicted by Iran. Yet hardly any of it has been engaged. Moreover, the U.S. has had to bring over 30 warships to the area, which will cost, according to the Pentagon, a minimum of $200 million, instead of the five to 10 ships that would have sufficed had the Saudis put shore facilities and air bases at the disposal of the U.S. The Navy secretary has complained about the absence of &quot;strategic cooperation from allies in the region.&quot;    But the Saudis have not just failed to cooperate. They have been contributing $750 million a year to Syria -- Iran's ally and proven sponsor of anti-Western terrorism -- to enable it to buy vast quantities of Soviet arms. They have given more than a billion dollars to the Palestine Liberation Organization directly, and withhold a PLO tax from every foreign Arab worker. They have undermined American-Jordanian efforts in the West Bank and have financed PLO activities there. They have opposed every American peace initiative and pressured others, including Jordan, to do so. Unremittingly hostile to the Camp David accords, they have refused to resume diplomatic relations with Egypt and have undermined Egypt's efforts to return to the Arab fold. They have participated in every Arab war on Israel except the 1956 Sinai campaign, and have just rejected Premier Shamir's offer to join a regional peace conference.    It is this pattern, rather than the administration's assurances, which points to the real reason for the staggering Saudi arms buildup. Last February, the Saudi defense minister said that the buildup was &quot;focused on Israel.&quot; He was echoing the late King Khaled, who said 11 years ago, &quot;When we build up our military power we have no design on anybody except those who took away our lands and holy places in Jerusalem, and we know who they are.&quot; Clearly, the Saudis see themselves as the custodians of the Arab arsenal for the next jihad against Israel.    In this context the administration's assurances are hardly reassuring. Unless the Saudis are required to shun terrorists, support the peace process and cooperate in defending the Gulf before receiving more arms, it will not be long before their F-15s join Syria's MiG-29s, also bought with Saudi money, to fight Israel's F-15s in another devastating Middle East conflagration.
