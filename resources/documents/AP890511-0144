Elke Falk, 44, was found guilty of passing more than 200confidential documents to Soviet intelligence agents between 1975and 1985.   The documents included West German intelligence reports,government and Cabinet minutes and information on NATO maneuvers.   Ms. Falk, who pleaded guilty, said she started spying afterfalling in love with a KGB agent who recruited her to work for theSoviets.   In passing sentence, Chief Judge Klaus Wagner said Ms. Falk wasa ``willing spy.''   ``Knowingly and with open eyes, she slipped deeper and deeperinto espionage and caused great damage to'' West Germany, the judgesaid.   But Wagner also praised Ms. Falk's cooperation withinvestigators after her arrest in March 1988, saying she gave ``newand important information about the KGB methods.''   According to the evidence introduced during the trial, Ms. Falkfell in love with a Soviet agent who used the cover name of GerhardThieme. The agent was never caught.   Ms. Falk told the court she met Thieme in 1973 through a``lonely hearts'' newspaper advertisement and considered him ``theman of my life.''   The KGB agent gave her a miniature camera concealed in a lighterand a hair spray can designed to hide films.   Ms. Falk worked in several government offices, including thechancellery and the ministries of transport and economiccooperation.   Judge Wagner said the most valuable intelligence material givento the Soviets came after Ms. Falk moved to the ministry ofeconomic cooperation in 1979.   ``They were not state secrets, but they contained thegovernment's assessment of the international situation,'' he said.   Wagner said the KGB paid for 23 vacations abroad for Ms. Falk,during which she met with her lover, who left West Germany in 1974.   For her 40th birthday, the KGB gave her a gold ring as apresent, the judge said.   The Duesseldorf court also ordered Ms. Falk to turn over to thestate the $5,200 she received from the KGB.   West Germany's counterespionage agency for years has warnedgovernment secretaries about the so-called ``Romeos'' _ communistagents who start relationships with single women working for thegovernment.   In the last major spy scandal to rock the West Germangovernment, 15 communist agents were arrested or disappearedbetween August and December 1985. Among them was Hans-JoachimTiedge, West Germany's counterespionage officer in charge ofcatching East German spies. Tiedge fled to East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
