LaVriha said that although some people think Anderson will notsee the letters, he believes they will be given to him.   ``The world will be watching,'' LaVriha said. ``I think there'sgoing to be some compassion shown.''   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, grew up in Lorain about 30 miles west of Cleveland.   He was abducted in Beirut on March 16, 1985, and faces his fourthChristmas in captivity.   To mark the end of the mail drive, students from the King'sAcademy formed a human chain around the school in Elyria for asilent vigil for Anderson. The vigil lasted four minutes, or oneminute for every year he has been a captive.   Most of the participants wore yellow, the color which has come tosymbolize hope for a welcome home for Anderson.   Julie Pellerite, 15, of Olmsted Falls, said she hoped the vigilwould encourage people to become concerned about Anderson's plight.   The mail will be boxed this weekend and sent to Lebanon throughthe efforts of Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, and the State Department.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say of Cadiz, Ky., said he has receivedmail in the past, often through a newspaper to which Anderson hasaccess. The paper has reported messages received on his behalf andprinted some, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
