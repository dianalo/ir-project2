(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The University of Louisville has softenedits proposed no-smoking rules, bowing to threats of budgetaryreprisals from legislators in a state where tobacco is a $2 billionindustry.   University President Donald Swain said Tuesday the new policy,which takes effect March 1, abandons a provision that all``irreconcilable'' conflicts between smokers and non-smokers beresolved in favor of non-smokers.   The original policy on smoking was drafted last fall but neverwent into effect at the university, where 22,000 students areenrolled. Some legislators had threatened the university with a lossin state support.   ``We've tried to address all concerns, including those of thelegislators,'' Swain said.   ``There was concern within the university that smokers be treatedwith some balance. We were concerned that the previous policy was alittle one-sided.''   Swain said the revised policy directs department heads to discussand settle conflicts with employees.   The policy also drops a ban on smoking in open work areas,directing instead that such areas be separated into smoking andnon-smoking areas or be designated one or the other afterdiscussions with the affected employees.   State Rep. Donnie Gedling, chairman of the Legislature's TobaccoTask Force and an outspoken opponent of the university's earlierproposal, said of the changes, ``I could live with that without anyproblem.''   ``If it's fair to smokers, that's what we want to look at,'' hesaid.   Another key legislator, House Agriculture Committee Chairman ClayCrupper, said any smoking policy was inappropriate for a publicinstitution in a tobacco-growing state. ``I didn't think they neededany regulation,'' he said.   Kentucky, the nation's top burley tobacco producer, had thecountry's highest smoking-related death rate in 1985, the U.S.Centers for Disease Control reported in November.</TEXT></DOC>
