The Directors Guild of America said it was pleased because it staved off rollbacks that producers demanded in the residuals, payments directors get for subsequent use of their work. Producers said they were happy because a new residual formula is tied to the success of productions, thus helping to control Hollywood's battle against runaway costs. The terms are part of a new three-year contract announced yesterday.    But both sides seemed to agree that the producers didn't win the major concessions that they had earlier demanded. &quot;It's probably more a victory for the Guild than the Alliance,&quot; said entertainment lawyer Peter Dekom.    The residual settlement issue could set a pattern for subsequent negotiations with writers and actors.    Negotiators for both the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers agreed to terms yesterday at 6:15 a.m EDT after a marathon session that began Monday night. The directors, who have never struck in the Guild's 51-year history, did walk out briefly early Tuesday morning before they heard about the settlement. Producers said a strike, even a selective one as threatened by the directors, would have resulted in a lockout of all union members.    Separately, the Guild also reached agreement on a new three-year contract with the National Broadcasting Co. unit of General Electric Co., which employs about 165 union members full-time in news, sports and other operations.    But the union still must negotiate contracts with CBS Inc., which employs about 150 full-time guild members, and Capital Cities/ABC Inc., with about 175 full-time union workers. Guild officials said workers for now will remain on the job during those negotiations.    The major sticking point with producers had been residuals, which totaled about $50 million last year. The pact announced yesterday changed only two aspects of those payments, neither of which appeared to be a major concession by the union.    &quot;I don't think it was a victory for anybody,&quot; said Lee Rich, chairman of MGM/ UA Communications Co. &quot;I think all we did is avoid a strike.&quot;    The new pact replaces the flat payments directors got for subsequent showings of hour-long TV shows with a formula based on how much the show is sold for. The formula goes as low as 50% of the current residual, and as high as 50% above it, depending on the price a show brings.    Mr. Dekom, the lawyer, said that if this plan is extended to the other entertainment unions, it will boost the value of hour-long shows in studio libraries by making more syndication economically feasible.    The agreement also changes residuals for cable television shows, imposing a 2.5% residual for pre-1984 shows and a 2% residual for those made later. Previously, pre-1984 shows carried a flat-rate residual, while later shows paid 1.2%.    But the pact doesn't make any changes in residuals for theatrical films, videocassettes, and pay-per-view television.    The Alliance previously insisted that residuals shouldn't have to be paid until a production shows a profit, but the Guild insisted that &quot;Hollywood accounting&quot; would be used to mask profits and eliminate the payments altogether.    &quot;It certainly appears to be a victory for the Directors Guild,&quot; said Ken Orsatti, national executive secretary for the Screen Actors Guild. &quot;They held the line.&quot;    Nevertheless, Alliance's president, Nicholas Counter, said he was happy with the agreement, because residual formulas on hour-long TV syndications and cable television shows were adjusted to vary more directly with the producers' gross.    Mr. Counter said this should make it easier to syndicate the hour-long shows, which lately have faced rough going after their initial run.    The production agreement, which covers such major companies as MCA Inc. and Walt Disney Co., also raises the basic Guild pay by 5% immediately, and by another 5% in 18 months. It also loosens the rules on directors' credits in advertising, which the Alliance says will save money and yield more effective ads.    The agreement with the Alliance, which now goes to the Guild membership for approval, ended a brief walkout against the Warner Bros. unit of Warner Communications Inc. and the Columbia Pictures unit of Coca-Cola Co.    Sources close to the guild talks with NBC said the two sides compromised on several points of dispute. The network won its demand for more flexibility in laying off guild members, for example, but only after it scaled back the scope of the changes. The contract will give union members 3% annual wage increases.    The union is expected to negotiate a settlement first with the American Broadcasting Cos. unit of Capital Cities/ABC and then with CBS. An ABC spokesman said talks with the guild haven't been scheduled. The two networks probably will seek concessions from the union on seniority and work-rule issues, network sources said. </TEXT></DOC>
