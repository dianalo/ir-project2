Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, interviewed on the CBS-TV ``ThisMorning'' program about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)treaty, requiring the destruction of all U.S. and Soviet missileswith a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, said:   ``There are still some issues that senators (Jesse) Helms(R-N.C.), (Malcolm) Wallop (R-Wyo.), (Steve) Symms (R-Idaho) andothers wish to be debated and those will take a good part of thisweek to conclude.''   He added that he thinks action is ``unlikely ... before thepresident leaves for Moscow, but said, ``I think it's stillpossible that the treaty could be ratified while he's there.''   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev beginfive days of meetings Sunday. Reagan leaves for Moscow on Wednesday.   Cohen said failure to ratify the treaty would be a seriousmistake.   ``I think that the treaty is verifiable,'' he said. ``It's inour interest to proceed, and to reject the treaty, I think, wouldjeopardize not only our relationship with our allies but underminethe president's ability to continue to serve as a spokesman forthis country.''   The Senate on Friday crushed a bid by the Republican right wingto tie the treaty to ending Soviet cheating on other arms controlaccords. All five sections of an amendment offered by Symms wereoverwhelmingly rejected and other attempts to change the treatywere rebuffed.   But Senate leaders indicated that ratification before the summitwould be difficult. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,said he may keep the Senate working late into the night this weekand may schedule a Saturday session.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., blamed the conservative GOP senatorsfor the delay, saying they do not want to see a successful summit.   ``The treaty is going to be approved by the Senate. It's just aquestion of whether we do it before or after the summit,'' Bumperssaid on the CBS show. ``I think people who are opposed to thetreaty feel that if it is approved by the Senate before then, thesummit will be successful and they don't want a successful summit.''</TEXT></DOC>
