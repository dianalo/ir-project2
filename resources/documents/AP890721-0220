Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the airline's attorneys werepreparing an appeal of the 3-0 ruling this week by the U.S. Courtof Appeals, which held that the union can seek to compelarbitration over Western Airlines' failure in 1987 to bind Delta toa collective bargaining agreement between the union and Western.   Western was merged into Atlanta-based Delta two years ago. Theruling was seen as favoring unions that have been hurt by airlinemergers.   Berry said the matter also had been addressed in two Californiadecisions in favor of two former Western flight attendants unions.The Supreme Court overturned both rulings and sent them back to the9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, he said.   ``Delta is going to go ahead and appeal this to the SupremeCourt,'' Berry said. ``We really thought the (appeals) courts,knowing what the Supreme Court had done, would have the samefinding.''   Before the merger between the two airlines, AFA negotiated majorwage and work rule concessions covering Western's flight attendants.   In exchange, the union won a clause in the collective bargainingagreement requiring Western to bind any successor or merger partnerto the agreement.   Western refused to arbitrate the union's subsequent grievanceover the alleged breach of contract for failing to bind Delta.</TEXT></DOC>
