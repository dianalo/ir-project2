Leading the agenda in both the House and Senate is legislationlaying out Pentagon spending priorities for the coming year.President Bush will be lobbying House members against an effort toeither freeze production of the B-2 bomber, known as the stealthbecause of its radar-eluding capabilities, or cut the number to bebuilt from eight per year to two.   Meanwhile, a House subcommittee is pushing ahead with itsinvestigation of the scandal at the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment. The House Government Operations housing subcommitteesummoned Lynda Murphy, a former career HUD employee, to testifytoday about dealings with her friend, Deborah Gore Dean, a formertop HUD official.   The administration contends that the stealth bomber, built topenetrate Soviet airspace, is a key to future U.S. nucleardeterrence. But members of Congress wrestling with serious deficitproblems are shocked at its cost _ more than half a billion dollarseach.   Also to be fought is the perennial debate over how much todevote to the administration's ``Star Wars'' Strategic DefenseInitiative and how much money to give to rail-mobile MX missilesversus the single-warhead Midgetman.   At the same time, the House is seeking to complete work on the13 basic spending bills needed to run the government in the nextfiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Congress also is pushing ahead onlegislation from child care to clean air and budget cuts.   Ms. Dean was executive assistant to former HUD secretary SamuelPierce, but numerous witnesses have described her as almost asurrogate Cabinet member who was heavily involved in funnelingdepartment money to well-placed Republicans.   ``Miss Dean has chosen to take the Fifth Amendment, and we verymuch hope that she will change her mind,'' said subcommitteechairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif. ``But we will need to get at herrole, if she's unprepared to testify, through individuals who hadclose contact with her.''   On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold adrafting session to deal with responses to last month's SupremeCourt's decision that burning the American flag is a protected formof political expression.   The panel's subcommittee on constitutional rights completedhearings last week on the issue. Congress is divided over whetherto seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or toaddress the matter through a simple change in the law.   After working behind closed doors most of last week, House andSenate negotiators on a $166 bailout plan for the savings and loanindustry will meet Tuesday with hopes of nailing down a finalpackage.   The major remaining disagreement is how to raise the $50 billionneeded immediately to cover the loss of federally insured depositsin some 500 Sandamp;Ls at or near insolvency because of poor and oftenfraudulent lending.   President Bush and the Senate want to raise the money through30-year private bonds in order to prevent the bailout from swellingthe federal deficit. The House and Democrats would borrow the moneydirectly through the Treasury, but exempt the amount from annualdeficit reduction targets.   The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote as early as Thursdayon the nomination of William C. Lucas to be Bush's assistantattorney general for civil rights at the Justice Department.   The black former sheriff of Wayne County, Michigan, is opposedby many civil rights groups for lack of experience, but Bushcontends he will be a tough enforcer of anti-discrimination laws.   And the House Ways and Means Committee continues work on a taxbill, with members apparently divided almost down the middle on aproposal favored by Bush to reduce taxes on capital gains.   The panel also will try to find a way to change the surtax thatfinances the catastrophic health insurance program for olderAmericans. Higher income retirees who pay most of the cost of theprogram have been lobbying the committee to spread the cost amongall taxpayers, not just older citizens.</TEXT></DOC>
