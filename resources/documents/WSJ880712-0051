Interest in harnessing the sun's power, so strong in the early 1980s, seemed to have died, a victim of the end of the energy crisis.    But these days new solar products are showing up everywhere. Solar power is being used to run automobile battery chargers, patio lights, typewriters, telephone answering machines, even tiny fans built into baseball hats.    And consumers are snapping these products up. &quot;Sales are booming,&quot; says John Schaeffer, who runs Real Goods Mail Order, a Ukiah, Calif., catalog-sales company specializing in alternative-energy goods. Over the past four months, for example, he has sold more than 200 of the hats with the built-in fans, at $21 each.    Currently, the industry's biggest seller is the pocket calculator. Consumers buy over 100 million of them a year, about $1 billion worth. Meanwhile, sales of other products are coming on strong and should reach roughly $400 million in 1988, up from about $300 million last year, according to James Caldwell, president of Atlantic Richfield Corp.'s Arco Solar unit, a leadin g solarpanel manufacturer.    This growth, says Mr. Caldwell, stems primarily from the increasing ability of solar-energy companies to take their technology and put it to use in areas of high consumer interest.    One area where that has happened involves recreational vehicles. At one time, Michael Voigt, a Fountain Hill, Ariz., golf-greens keeper, could only give his RV's 12-volt battery system a single charge before heading out on the road. Invariably, he says, the battery &quot;would conk out right when my wife needed the water pump to do the dinner dishes.&quot; But since installing a solar-powered electric system on the RV's roof, Mr. Voigt says his battery hasn't lost its charge once.    First introduced four years ago, about 50,000 of these solar units have been sold at $100 to $600 each. And with a market of 10 million motor homes now on the road, they are expected to become a mainstay of the fledgling industry.    Solar energy also may find a niche in the automobile business. General Motors Corp.'s Delco Remy division, for example, is developing a solar-powered, &quot;trickle&quot; battery charger. Built into a car's roof or a tail ornament, the charger will feed a tiny but steady flow of power to the battery and keep it from losing its charge in cars sitting idle for lengthy periods.    Generating electricity from the sun takes two or more side-by-side layers of a semiconductor material such as silicon. Sunlight is made up of photons, and when these photons strike the silicon, they are absorbed, knocking loose some of the silicon's electrons. These electrons then flow back and forth from one silicon layer to the other, creating an electric field whose current can be tapped.    Solar energy's revival has been aided considerably by improvements in the industry's basic technology. Take the inverter, the device that transforms the direct current produced by solar panels into the alternating current on which household appliances run. The primary problem was reliability -- the devices kept breaking down. But manufacturers licked that by building the units with solid-state circuitry.    As a result, Ray Harm, a cattle rancher and painter who lives near Sasabe, Ariz. -- and far from any utility line -- can now watch television without fear of losing his picture. &quot;The difference (in technology) between now and five years ago is amazing,&quot; he says.    An inverter, however, is an optional piece of equipment -- and, at $500 to $1,000 each, a costly one. But those who do without must use products that run on direct current. That's why a number of companies, including Emerson Radio Corp. and Panasonic Co., a division of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., have all begun selling direct-current TVs, VCRs, typewriters and telephone answering machines. (The prices are comparable with their alternating-current counterparts.)    Meanwhile, other companies are trying to duplicate the success of the pocket calculator, shoving onto the market such less-than-compelling candidates as solar-powered Christmas tree lights and a solar-powered duck plucker.    Still, a few products do seem to be showing promise. The solar-powered patio light is one example. Last year, Chronar Corp., of Princeton, N.J., sold 140,000 of its version, at $40 to $50 each. So far this year, it has shipped 250,000 patio lights.    Despite such successes, the solar industry's future as a consumer-products giant is by no means guaranteed. The major hurdle it faces is how to lower costs enough to become competitive with electricity supplied through power lines by utility companies. Currently, a kilowatt hour of solar energy costs about 20 cents, while electricity from a utility company averages about half that.    But when parity is achieved -- and proponents predict it should happen by 1995 -- industrywide sales of consumer-solar products could jump to as much as $5 billion annually, according to Arco Solar. </TEXT></DOC>
