Meanwhile, the military commander of the Gaza Strip said violenceis increasing in the Israeli-occupied territory.   In the Gaza Strip, eight Palestinians were shot and wounded inclashes with soldiers, hospital officials said. The army said it wasinvestigating the reports and confirmed two wounded in a West Bankvillage.   At least 558 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops orcivilians since the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupiedterritories began in December 1987. Thirty-nine Israelis have diedin the violence.   Also Wednesday, an opposition member of Parliament asked Israel'sattorney general to ensure that the computerized identity cards arenot used for collective punishment.   The army spokesman said the Arabs detained for crossing intoIsrael without cards were given the choice of paying a $250 fine orspending two months in prison. Israel radio said one Palestinian wasacquitted.   The plastic cards are only issued to Gazans who have paid theirtaxes and passed security checks.   Israel says they are necessary to improve security, butPalestinian leaders say they undercut Arabs' ability to work inIsrael. An estimated 50,000 Gazans hold jobs in Israel.   The cards have sparked a political tug of war, with Palestinianactivists sometimes collecting the cards by force and burning them.   Army radio said over the past four days, an average of 5,000 to10,000 Palestinians have crossed daily from Gaza into Israel, aboutone-quarter the total before the new cards were issued.   The radio said it was unclear whether workers were intimidated byPalestinian activists or were sleeping in Israel instead ofcommuting.   Meanwhile, the army commander for Gaza, Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai,said violence has increased in Gaza and that the uprising haschanged from mass demonstrations to hit-and-run attacks by maskedPalestinians.   The masked youths enforce uprising directives and often killfellow Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel. At least 108Palestinians have been killed in this way.   ``We are meeting them more and more and attacking them more andmore,'' Vilnai said on Army radio.   In a strongly worded letter, Dedi Zucker of the left-wingCitizens Rights Movement called for strict controls ``so that thecards are used for legitimate security purposes and not forcollective punishment and collective sanctions.''   He asked Attorney General Yosef Harish to rule on whether Gazansdenied the new cards by the army could be blocked from enteringIsrael to visit hospitalized relatives or prisoners.   Zucker also asked whether troops could ban entry to Arab workersfrom a village if they wanted to punish the community for activitiesstemming from the 20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, Arab residents said sevenIsraeli security men, disguised as uprising activists arrested twobrothers in a raid Tuesday night.   The brothers were identified as Issam and Samir El Sarougi. Arabreports said Issam had been wanted for anti-Israeli activities thepast year.</TEXT></DOC>
