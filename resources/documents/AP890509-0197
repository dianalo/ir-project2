No arrests have been made and the investigation is continuing,but Cuban paintings and records have been seized from an art dealerhere, said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney DexterLehtinen.   A U.S. Customs Service affidavit said Jerry W. Scott, thespokesman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, brought thepaintings into this country in violation of the Cuban trade embargo.   ``We have a lot of documents, records and other evidence to goover,'' Ms. Cossin said. ``It's not over yet by any means.''   The U.S. Information Agency, for which Scott worked in Havana asthe section's media spokesman, praised Scott's job performance.   ``He's got a good record,'' said spokesman William Reinckens.   Reinckens said no disciplinary action was planned. He said hecould not discuss the merits of the case against Scott, who nowworks in Washington.   In Washington, the State Department refused to comment andreferred calls back to Customs.   The paintings were seized Friday from Ramon Cernuda, owner ofthe Editorial Cernuda art gallery in Miami, after an affidavitsworn by Customs Agent Peter D. Liston was submitted to a federalmagistrate.   Cernuda has said the investigation is prompted by his oppositionto the powerful Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful,militantly anti-Castro lobbying group.   Customs began its investigation following publicity about anApril 1988 auction at the Cuban Museum of Art and Culture in Miamiwhich allegedly involved Cernuda-owned Cuban paintings, Liston saidin the affidavit.   ``Cuban art is being smuggled into the United States forpersonal gain and allegedly to profit members of the Cubangovernment,'' Liston said.   Liston said that by bidding prices up at art auctions andprivate sales, Cuba's government, which holds the largest amount ofCuban artwork, ``realizes the greater economic benefits.''   The affidavit did not distinguish between members of the Cubangovernment or the government. Officials would not comment Tuesdayon that, saying the investigation is continuing.   The probe determined that some paintings had made their way toCernuda from Scott.   The United States has no formal relations with Cuba, butmaintains the Interests Section to handle such things as visas androutine legal transactions.   Liston said that in February 1988 Scott brought 40 paintingsinto Miami International Airport, and failed to declare to Customsinspectors that he was bringing Cuban art into this country inviolation of regulations.   The Cuban provision of the Trading With The Enemy Act prohibitsvirtually all commerce with Cuba after 1963, the agent said.   Scott acknowledged to Liston last April 28 that he had handedthe paintings over to Cernuda, the agent said. Scott then calledCernuda, who confirmed he still had the artworks.   Cernuda also bought paintings from Guido Adriaenssens, whosmuggled about 100 paintings into the United States, the affidavitalleged.   ``This is absurd,'' said Cernuda's attorney, Ted Klein. ``TheU.S. attorney should hang his head in shame for attempting to seizeartwork, which is basically intellectual property that is nodifferent than books or records or motion pictures or magazines.''   Anyone convicted of trading with the enemy could be sentenced toup to 10 years in prison and fined $250,000 for each violation, theU.S. attorney's office said.</TEXT></DOC>
