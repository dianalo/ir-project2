Four main formations have been distinguished within the breccias.The basal formations are in depositional contact over the previouslytectonized and eroded deepest part of the ophiolites. The upper brecciasare dated as middle Maastrichtian, which is the age of the depositionof synchronous serpentinitic olistostromes onto the continental margin.These data suggest that the breccias formed as debris slides from bathymetrichighs on the ocean crust as a result of renewed tectonic activity accompanyingobduction onto the continental margin.</TEXT></DOC>
