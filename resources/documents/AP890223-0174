WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp defended his appeals toliberals and civil rights activists before the Republican Party'sright wing Thursday and invited the conservatives to join in theBush administration.   ``I want you to participate in this administration,'' thesecretary of housing and urban development told the ConservativePolitical Action Conference.   ``Ronald Reagan started the revolution,'' Kemp said. ``I'll betyou right here and now, today, that George Bush, President Bush,will consolidate it, strengthen it, broaden it, broaden its appeal.I hope to bring it into the inner city.''   The meeting is a gathering of more than 40 conservative groups,led by the American Conservative Union and the Young Americans forFreedom, a politically conservative organization for youth.   Kemp, a conservative who had the backing of many in the audiencewhen he ran for the Republican presidential nomination last year,was asked by one conservative supporter about his recent meetingswith civil rights leaders, who are also Democrats. The questionerasked whether he was overlooking conservative blacks who havesupported Republicans in the past.   ``I want to visit with all people,'' Kemp responded.   ``Look, don't worry. Everybody is going to be heard,'' he added.``It's what you do and who you follow and what kind of ideas youexpress that we ought to judge our final results by.''   Kemp met with several black leaders, including the widow and sonsof Martin Luther King Jr., during a tour of Atlanta neighborhoodslast week.   After the meeting with conservatives, Kemp departed for hissecond trip as secretary, touring shelters and programs for thehomeless in Baltimore and Philadelphia.   Kemp also commented on the ethics statement he had signed toaccept the Cabinet position, saying: ``I promised on my ethicsstatement that I would never, ever, ever make any money again in mywhole life. That's what it feels like, almost.''   Kemp's wide-ranging remarks also brought him to the subject ofthe Federal Reserve's monetary policy where the former congressman,an avid advocate of tax cuts and supply-side economics, stoppedhimself:   ``I'm not going to get into Federal Reserve Board policy becausethat's not my portfolio. I lust for that portfolio, but I don't haveit.''</TEXT></DOC>
