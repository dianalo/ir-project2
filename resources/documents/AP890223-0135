The Charter 77 human rights group issued a statement calling forcitizens to oppose ``the lies and injustice ... around all of us.''Former Communist Party chief Alexander Dubcek was quoted as callingfor the release of Havel and all political prisoners.   Also on Thursday, thousands of people attended a rally in aPrague square marking the 41st anniversary of the ruling communists'1948 takeover.   The charges against Charter 77 signatories Vlasta Chramostova andLibuse Silhanova and spokesman Tomas Hradilek were leveledWednesday, the same day a Prague court sentenced two youngeractivists to nine months and one year in jail.   Ms. Chramostova and Ms. Silhanova were charged with approving acrime and attacking state organs, charges that carry a maximum jailsentence of one year, said fellow activist Petr Uhl.   Hradilek was charged with sedition, punishable by up to fiveyears in jail. The charges against Ms. Chramostova and Ms. Silhanovawere based on open letters they wrote Jan. 16 supporting a banneddemonstration the day before and condemning the police violence usedto break it up.   The demonstration was to mark the 20th anniversary of the deathof Jan Palach, a student who set himself afire to protest the 1968Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.   The actions and this week's conviction and sentencing of Havelconstituted one of the biggest crackdowns ever on the human rightsgroup.   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo on Thursday carried alengthy attack on Havel, who despite strong protests from the Westand East bloc was ordered jailed for nine months Tuesday for hisrole in a banned demonstration last month.   Havel, a co-founder of Charter 77, was depicted as the son ofrich parents said to have collaborated with the occupying Nazis inWorld War II and as a man who wanted to restore the bourgeoisdemocracy that existed before the war.   Charter 77 issued a statement to commemorate the death on Feb.25, 1969, of Jan Zajic, a 19-year-old student who also set himselfafire.   ``Let us at least try to react to that now, 20 years later _ nolonger by demonstrating, but each of us in our own place and at ourown discretion,'' said the statement released in Prague and London.   ``Lies and injustice are visible all around us. Everyone of us isa witness to irresponsible, frivolous, self-seekingdecision-making,'' it said. ``Let us not accept it ... Let us pointout every wrong and let us not allow ourselves to be brushed aside.''   The human rights organization, formed in January 1977, was namedfor the document issued by founding members calling onCzechoslovakia to respect civil liberties.   In an interview published in the current edition of theunderground journal Lidove Noviny, former Communist Party chiefAlexander Dubcek denounced the jailing of Havel and others as anaction ``against common sense.''   ``(Recent) demonstrations are thus a direct reflection of thepolicy of the party over the last 20 years ... Socialism is notthreatened by RFE (Radio Free Europe) but by a wrong policy whichignores social needs and the opinions of people...,'' said Dubcek,who was ousted after the 1968 invasion.   In Prague's Old Town Square, Politburo member Miroslav Stepantold a rally that authorities ``absolutely reject the casting ofdoubts'' on the government program.   Stepan's speech was sparsely applauded by a crowd estimated bythe state news agency CTK at 120,000. Western reporters estimatedconsiderably fewer people on the square.   Stepan has been in the forefront of an apparent leadershipattempt to stem mounting dissatisfaction and pressure for reform inCzechoslovakia.   He has met in recent weeks with several of nearly 3,000 artistsand scientists who took the unprecedented step of protesting thedetention of Havel and other dissidents Jan. 16 and the policeviolence used to break up anti-government protests last month.   The effort at dialogue has gone hand-in-hand with the crackdownon known dissenters and stiffened penalties on violating publicorder.</TEXT></DOC>
