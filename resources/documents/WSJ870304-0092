Tonight at 9 o'clock EST, Mr. Reagan will have his latest opportunity to set the record straight on his own role in the Iran-Contra affair, and more than any time before, advisers and supporters say, his credibility is on the line.    Since the story of the arms sales to Iran broke last November, the president has never conceded that he was personally mistaken in the conduct of the policy or that the policy was faulty. Gradually, over the months, he has acknowledged that mistakes were made by his staff in executing the policy. But he has stubbornly clung to the view that the policy itself was worthy and that it wasn't an arms-for-hostages deal.    With the release of the Tower Commission report last Thursday, the president is being urged to speak candidly about his views and his own accountability. &quot;I think he has to admit that the policy was flawed. Secondly, he has to accept responsibility for what happened,&quot; says Wyoming Rep. Richard Cheney, who was President Ford's chief of staff.    Advisers who have seen a draft of the speech say the president will tell the nation that he wouldn't have undertaken the same course of action if he knew then what he knows now. &quot;Whether he says the policy was a mistake or not remains to be seen,&quot; says one adviser.    A review of Mr. Reagan's past statements shows his changing responses to questions raised about his Iran policy.    The president's first public utterance on the subject of arms sales to Iran in connection with freeing American hostages was firm, but wrong. On Nov. 6, in response to questions from reporters during a bill-signing ceremony at the White House, he said reports of U.S. arms sales had &quot;no foundation.&quot;    Seven days later, in a televised speech to the nation meant to quell rising concern generated by evidence that the initial reports were true, he conceded there were arms sales. But he insisted that the U.S. &quot;has not swapped boatloads or planeloads of American weapons for the return of American hostages.&quot;    Whatever weapons had been sent, the president said, were &quot;modest deliveries, taken together (they) could easily fit into a single cargo plane.&quot; Moreover, despite later statements from experts to the contrary, the president stated that all of the arms transferred &quot;could not, taken together, affect the outcome&quot; of the Iran-Iraq War.    At a news conference Nov. 19, President Reagan reiterated that the arms could have been transported in one plane, with &quot;plenty of room left over.&quot; However, former Sen. John Tower, chairman of the investigating panel, said only a giant C-5 transport, the world's largest plane, might have carried the arms in a single flight.    Multiple flights of normal cargo jets were in fact used to carry the thousands of missiles and other gear sold to Iran. Also, in discussing the military help for the Iranians, Mr. Reagan failed to mention that over objections from some experts in the Central Intelligence Agency, he signed a &quot;finding&quot; directing the U.S. to share intelligence with Iran. He later told the Tower Commission he hadn't realized that intelligence was being shared.    Since his first statement on the controversy Nov. 6, and on through his last major address, the Jan. 27 State of the Union message, President Reagan has continued to defend what he has said were the &quot;goals&quot; of his policy, criticizing only the execution. He has repeatedly denied his policy was an arms-for-hostages swap. On Nov. 25, after firing Lt. Col. Oliver North and accepting the resignation of National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter, he nonetheless said, &quot;I believe our policy goals toward Iran were well-founded.&quot; In a Dec. 6 radio address, he defined those goals as simply an effort to &quot;establish a relationship with responsible moderates in Iran.&quot;    In his most candid assessment, in a Nov. 26 Time magazine interview that his aides later said he thought was off the record, Mr. Reagan insisted: &quot;We took the only action we could have in Iran. I am not going to disavow it. I do not think it was a mistake. No, it has not worked out the way we hoped, but I don't see anything I would have done differently.&quot;    Despite the president's claim that the U.S. was dealing only with Iranian &quot;moderates,&quot; a memo written last July by Vice President George Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, specifically noted that Mr. Bush was warned by Israeli counterterrorism expert Amiram Nir that deals were being made with Iranian radicals.    And President Reagan's protestations about not swapping arms for hostages have now been contradicted by the Tower Commission report, which concluded that, &quot;Almost from the beginning, the initiative became in fact a series of arms-for-hostages deals.&quot;    From the time the controversy first erupted, Mr. Reagan's sense of who should shoulder the blame for his Iran-Contra problems has gone through a series of changes. On Nov. 26, in the interview with Time, the president blamed the press. &quot;This wasn't a failure until the press got a tip from that rag in Beirut and began to play it up. I told them that publicity could destroy this, that it could get people killed, they then went right on. . . . This whole thing boils down to a great irresponsibility on the part of the press,&quot; he said.    In that interview, Mr. Reagan praised Col. North, whom he had just fired, as &quot;a national hero,&quot; and Adm. Poindexter as &quot;a fine naval officer.&quot; But at about the same time, the president began to imply that unidentified underlings had strayed in executing his orders, and that he hadn't been fully informed. In a Nov. 25 statement he said that, &quot;In one aspect, implementation of that policy was seriously flawed . . . I was not fully informed.&quot;    On Dec. 6, Mr. Reagan said in his radio address, &quot;it's obvious that the execution of these policies was flawed and mistakes were made.&quot; He nonetheless insisted at the time that contrary to being a failure, the policy resulted in &quot;some notable success: There was some reduction in terrorism, and three or four hostages were released.&quot;    By Jan. 27, as his advisers were urging him to disavow the policy in his State of the Union address, the president repeated earlier statements that &quot;The goals were worthy. I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives. And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity.&quot;    But, still using the passive tense, and not holding himself or anyone else in particular accountable, he added that, &quot;serious mistakes were made&quot; and vowed that &quot;I will get to the bottom of this, and take whatever action is called for.&quot;    As he was pressed by the Tower panel to explain contradictions in his own testimony and that of his aides, Mr. Reagan concluded in a Feb. 28 letter to the commission: &quot;In trying to recall events that happened eighteen months ago, I'm afraid that I let myself be influenced by others' recollections, not my own. . . . My answer therefore, and the simple truth is, I don't remember -- period.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
