The French government denied any deals were struck or paymentsmade.   ``I think it's thoroughly bad,'' said Peter Temple-Morris, theparliamentary specialist on Lebanon for Britain's ConservativeParty. ``No responsible nation and no responsible government _ andI say that directly to the French government and the French people_ should deal with terrorism.''   ``Brazen and cynical,'' added David Owen of the Social Democrats.   In Washington, the Reagan administration reiterated its refusalto deal with kidnappers. ``We hope that deals were not made of akind that we object to in our own policies on terrorism,'' saidWhite House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   French Premier Jacques Chirac, who received credit for therelease four days before facing President Francois Mitterrand inpresidential elections, said after greeting the hostages Thursday,``We have never ceased to act with dignity and honor, conformingstrictly to values shared with other countries, adhering strictlyto the grand principles of our foreign policy, to those of ourfriends.''   Media reports said France agreed to pay Iran the remaining $400million of a longstanding $1 billion loan frozen after the IslamicRevolution in 1979.   Persistent speculation is that Chirac also agreed to temper armssales to Iraq, Iran's enemy in a 7{-year-old war, and increasethose to Iran, along with a direct payment labeled for some otherpurpose. None of this could be confirmed.   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua insisted, ``We have not cededto any claim. We have not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone,not a franc, not a dollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''      Peggy Say, sister of Associated Press correspondent TerryAnderson who has been held hostage since March 1985, said shethinks the United States is doing little to free the hostages. ``Italmost appears the French government places a higher priority onthe lives of their people than the American government does,'' shesaid in Batavia, N.Y.   Despite the government denials, Remy Leveau, professor andMiddle East expert at the prestigious Political Sciences Institute,said he was certain a deal had been struck. Even so, he said itwould not encourage terrorists.      ``This phenomenon has become generalized, and it is with you,whether you pay or you don't pay,'' he said. ``The Americans provedwith Irangate that they are also willing to deal in the end.''   ``This has gotten to be the hotel business,'' he said. ``Francepaid the bill.''   Ivor Stanbrook, another British Conservative Party legislator,directed reproach at Chirac.   ``It is a desperate attempt by Chirac to save hiscandidacy...disgraceful. The consequences for all Europeans in theMiddle East will now be that much more dangerous, and for theFrench they will be dire. It is a desperately foolish thing to havedone,'' he said.   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reaffirmed herdetermination not to pay ransom to the captors of Britons missingin Lebanon. ``We will not in fact pay ransom or make any particularpayment of that kind in order for the hostages to be released,''she told Parliament.   But Mitterrand's campaign manager, Pierre Beregovoy, said thehostages were released ``in conditions that do honor to ourcountry.''   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing NationalFront who ran against Mitterrand and Chirac in last month'spreliminary presidential election and was eliminated from therunoff, called the deal ``a defeat.''   `There is the other side of this, a death and the price that Iwould like to know. There is only one way to deal with terrorists,that used in Ouvea.''   He was referring to the French police raid on Melanesianseparatists holding hostages in New Caledonia. Fifteenhostage-takers were killed, and the 23 hostages were freed.   Abroad, comment ranged from dubious to scathing. The influentialSwiss daily, Tribune de Geneve, editorialized:   ``In freeing (the hostages), Tehran raised stakes to themaximum. What is the price paid by Paris? Very high, mostlikely...not counting eventual ransoms denied officially butinsinuated privately.''   Reporters watched for a possible release of Anis Nacache, heldin a French prisoner for the attempted assassination of formerIranian prime minister Shahpour Bakhtiar.   French papers offered triumphant headlines but subdued comment.The normally iconoclastic and widely read daily, Liberation,limited itself to a signed comment by Marc Kravetz, its foreigneditor.   ``First, the joy, undiluted joy,'' he wrote, adding later:``This liberation is certainly a considerable success for those whoobtained it. Success for shadowy diplomacy and bargaining.   ``Forget money paid to kidnappers, secondary players in theoperation. Iran wanted arms, political concessions, prisonersreleased. We do not know _ will we ever know? _ what was paid.   ``Joy cannot hide the uneasiness,'' Kravetz concluded. ``It isas absurd to deny this happiness as it is legitimate to worry overthe immediate future.''   The influential daily, Le Monde, published Thursday afternoon,did not mention British criticism, and its editorial skirtedforeign comment. But it raised key questions:   What was Algeria's role? Why did Iranian leaders _ and ShiiteLebanese who follow them _ accord to Chirac what they refused aSocialist prime minister two years ago?   And, finally, the question everyone is asking and no one hasanswered convincingly: What was the price?``</TEXT></DOC>
