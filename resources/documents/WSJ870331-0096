The king remains so upset that he is putting off a decision on a trip to Washington that the Reagan administration badly wants him to make in April. Instead, the king is dispatching his prime minister and foreign minister to Washington this week to test whether the U.S. is willing to act on any of a series of proposed steps to mend fences with the Arab world.    &quot;Any suggestions everything is going very well in terms of U.S.-Arab relations is very naive,&quot; says a top official in the Jordanian royal palace. &quot;I don't believe they have ever been at such a low point.&quot; The comments by this official pointedly contradict an assertion by President Reagan recently that American ties to the region are better than they have been in years.    The Reagan administration is pressing King Hussein to visit Washington to demonstrate that the U.S. can work with moderate Arabs despite the scandal over arms sales to Iran. But the king doesn't want to make a trip simply to give the Reagan administration a public-relations boost, Jordanian officials say.    Rather, they say, the king must see real changes in U.S. attitude to justify a trip. Significantly, King Hussein met recently with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian leader agreed to put off his own consideration of a trip to Washington because of unhappiness over both the Iran arms deal and an American proposal to delay but not reduce high interest payments on Egypt's $4.5 billion military debt to the U.S.    Jordan is smarting more than most Arab states over the Iran arms deal. King Hussein had worked personally over the past few years to try to bring Iraq and the U.S. closer. Just four days before the news of the Iran arms sales broke, a visiting U.S. military delegation assured King Hussein that America was working to block arms sales to Iran.    So Jordan is insistent that America make ammends. Specifically, Jordan is asking for clear American support for an international conference on peace in the Middle East; U.S. funding for a development program in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip; a renewed American effort to choke off arms sales from around the world to Iran, and a new international diplomatic effort to end the Iran-Iraq war.    The U.S. has said it is willing to consider the idea of a conference on the Middle East but warns that it sees problems. And while the U.S. is likely to express willingness to discuss the other Jordanian requests, it probably will say its ability to fulfill them generally is limited.    Jordan already has asked the U.S. to start repairing the damage from its arms sales to Iran by selling arms to Iraq, several Jordanian sources say. But the U.S., arguing that it doesn't want to repeat the mistake it made in selling arms to Iran, has declined, they say.    The most important of these issues to King Hussein is the international conference on the Middle East. He has come to believe that such a conference is the only way to settle peacefully the Palestinian issue and to resolve the status of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Gaza strip and Golan heights.    As Jordan envisions it, such a conference would bring together the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the U.S., the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France -- along with Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and a Palestinian delegation, to hammer out a comprehensive, internationally accepted peace agreement. Israel would talk directly to a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and to Syria under the &quot;guidance&quot; of the conference. The conference then would help resolve disputes that arise in talks between Israel and the Arabs.    However, the U.S., among other things, isn't eager for a conference that would draw the Soviet Union into the Middle East peace process, in which America traditionally has been the dominant superpower.    So the U.S. has talked of a much looser international &quot;umbrella&quot; for peace talks, rather than a rigid conference. &quot;There are a number of points on which we don't see eye to eye with Washington at this time&quot; concerning the peace process, said the official in the royal palace. &quot;We hope to see those resolved.&quot;    Of course, it's still far from certain that central players like Israel and the Palestinians could be drawn to the same conference. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opposes the idea of a conference, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres favors it in principle, and Israeli public opinion is split. Meanwhile, Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasar Arafat may have to drop cooperation with Jordan and adopt a more radical position if he is to survive an upcoming PLO convention designed to reunite radical and moderate Palestinian factions. Thus the PLO may soon move farther away from being a peace partner acceptable to others called to the conference. </TEXT></DOC>
