Atlanta won the prize on the fifth ballot taken among theIOC's 86 members, who had gathered in Tokyo. Atlantacollected 51 votes compared with 35 for the runner-up ofAthens, Greece. Athens had been the sentimental favoritebecause 1996 will mark the 100th anniversary of the firstmodern Olympics, which were held in Athens. The othercompetitors were Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Manchester, England;Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto.   &quot;Right now, we're going to sit back and say, `Thank you,'do a little fishing, and get reacquainted with our spouses,&quot;said William Payne, president of the Atlanta OrganizingCommittee and the force behind the city's bid.   That might be all that Atlanta's organizers have time for.By most accounts, the city won the Games for three reasons:its incessant and highly successful lobbying of IOC members;the city's infrastructure, including numerous hotels and oneof the world's largest airports; and the likelihood thatAtlanta will generate a sizable surplus, part of which goesto the IOC.   What the city lacks, however, are many of the basicfacilities needed to stage an Olympics. Atlanta estimates itwill have to spend more than $400 million on new constructionalone, including an 85,000-seat track-and-field stadium,housing for athletes, a swimming and diving site, and avelodrome for bicycling competition.   Moreover, problems that were all but drowned out in theclamor surrounding the city's bid -- including Atlanta'sexploding crime rate and extensive homeless population --will likely resurface as millions of dollars from TV networksand corporate sponsors pour into the Atlanta OrganizingCommittee's coffers.   For instance, within hours of the IOC's decision,Greenpeace Action, a local environmental group, called on theGames' organizers to &quot;tie the growing problems ofhomelessness in Atlanta to the development of the Olympics,&quot;and to &quot;achieve full housing in the city by 1996.&quot;   Perhaps the most difficult task Atlanta's organizers facein the coming months is simply abandoning their role assalesmen and adopting that of developers. &quot;For three years,they've been trying to win friends and influence people,&quot;said John Bevilaqua, a vice president at the Los AngelesOlympics and now president of a sports marketing firm inAtlanta. &quot;Now they'll be working on a dozen fronts: dealingwith environmental impact studies; setting up a securityplan; trying to find 100,000 volunteers -- you name it.&quot;   And while the 1996 Olympics are more than 2,000 days away,Atlanta's organizers may begin to feel some pressure in thenot-too-distant future, according to one individual familiarwith the process.   Barcelona, Spain, the site of the 1992 Summer Olympics,&quot;will become the focus of the world and shelter {Atlanta} abit,&quot; said Peter Ueberroth, head of the 1984 Games in LosAngeles. But &quot;immediately afterward, the time will go quitequickly.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
