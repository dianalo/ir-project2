Normally, the two Lockheed P-3 airborne early warning aircraftuse their high-tech radar to locate drug-ferrying airplanes. Butlast Monday, the mission was different.   One of the planes was assigned to fly the new Customs Servicecommissioner, Carol Hallett, and William Bennett _ director of theOffice of National Drug Control Strategy _ from Savannah, Ga., toTampa, Fla., for a conference.   On the way, Customs Service officials were to demonstrate thecomputerized radar system designed especially for detection ofdrug-smuggling aircraft.   According to an account by Customs Service spokesman DavidHoover, the difficulties began Sunday night when one of the twoaircraft left its base in Corpus Christi, Texas, on a regularsurveillance mission. That plane experienced a failure in the radarsystem and returned home.   Monday morning, Customs launched its other P-3 to pick up theofficials, but a fluid pump in the cooling system failed in flight.The system pumps vital coolant to the radar components, whichcannot be allowed to overheat.   The plane bound for Savannah made an unscheduled landing in NewOrleans in an effort to fix the problem. But to get the part,Customs officials had to fly the plane that was grounded Sundaynight to New Orleans, so the defective part could be switched.   The cooling system in the Savannah-bound plane was fixed, butwhen the radar was turned on, a spark knocked out the componentsthat let the radar run on high power.   So when Bennett and Mrs. Hallett got their tour, the radar wason low power, meaning that it's range was reduced from about 250miles to 80 miles.   ``It was picking up a multitude of targets,'' Hoover said.``There was no perceptible difference in the way the radar worksbetween high and low power.''   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said Bennett ``knew there wassome concern about the radar. But he had a great trip. He enjoyedit. He learned a lot of useful information.''</TEXT></DOC>
