(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three men who held the most powerfuljobs in the West Virginia Senate face stiff prison terms and finesthis week after being snared in a corruption investigation thatswept through the Legislature.   Former Senate President Larry Tucker and former Majority LeaderSi Boettner go before U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. onWednesday. Former Senate President Dan Tonkovich faces sentencingThursday.   The three, all Democrats, are the latest West Virginia publicofficials to fall to investigations by U.S. Attorney Mike Carey.   Carey, 35, also has nailed a House of Delegates member, a topSenate aide and two lobbyists on various corruption charges. And heobtained an indictment of a Charleston-area dog track owner whoallegedly fed some of the corruption with dollars bet at the track.   West Virginia already was reeling from two forced resignationsthis summer. Treasurer A. James Manchin stepped down to avoid astate Senate trial on articles of impeachment after he wasdisgraced over the loss of $279 million in a state investment fund.Attorney General Charlie Brown quit after conceding he changed histestimony during child custody proceedings.   Carey says his work isn't over yet, but he repeatedly hasdeclined to elaborate.   ``These cases do show the system is corruptible, as are mostsystems of government,'' Carey said.   Carey's investigations have caused consternation in theStatehouse, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 30-4 in theSenate and 80-20 in the House.   Senate President Keith Burdette has asked Carey to conclude theinvestigation as soon as possible. ``It makes my job tougher,''said Burdette, who at age 34 took over from Tucker as Senatepresident.   ``It's undermined the public's confidence in state government,''Burdette said. He supports the investigations, however.   ``I think it's a necessary purge of that element of publicofficials in West Virginia,'' said House Speaker Chuck Chambers.   Tucker, 54, who spent 18 years in the Legislature beforebecoming Senate president in 1988, resigned and pleaded guiltySept. 11 to extorting $10,000 from dog track interests. He facesfines of $250,000 and 20 years in prison.   Tucker's plea briefly interrupted the extortion trial ofTonkovich, 43, Senate president from 1984 to 1987, when he left theSenate for an unsuccessful bid for governor. Tucker then became aprosecution witness against Tonkovich.   Tucker admitted that he had pocketed $10,000. The scandal costhim a job as a bank executive vice president.   Three days later, Tonkovich pleaded guilty to extorting $5,000from casino gambling interests in return for help on a bill tolegalize gaming. The bill was not passed.   Witnesses testified that Tonkovich's aide, Bob Cain, had pressedthem for campaign donations. Cain admitted being part of alaundering scheme to get $15,000 in gaming money for Tonkovich.   Cain and track and insurance lobbyist Bonnie Wymer pleadedguilty to federal income tax charges and both testified againstTonkovich. Cain and Wymer were sentenced to probation Thursday.   Last December, state Delegate Bob McCormick was convicted ofextortion. Lobbyist John Vandergrift revealed he paid money toMcCormick for help on a bill, and also said he lavished $160,000 onthe Legislature in three years.   Vandergrift, lobbyist for a group of foreign doctors who soughtto ease restrictions on their obtaining U.S. medical licenses,pleaded guilty to a federal income tax charge and spent less thansix months in prison. He admitted he had not filed income taxreturns for 16 years.   Boettner pleaded guilty Sept. 23 to federal charges of incometax evasion for taking money from the same lobbyist who paid offTucker. Boettner, who faces 20 years in prison and fines of$250,000, also testified against Tonkovich.   The lobbyist, Sam D'Annunzio, committed suicide Dec. 4, 1988,police said.   Facing a February trial is dog track owner Bill Ellis. He isalleged to have paid $10,000 to Tucker and offered $13,000 toTonkovich through D'Annunzio for help on a bill that increased histrack's take by $1.1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
