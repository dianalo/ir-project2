Superior Court Commissioner James Endman allowed the custody caseto proceed Thursday after a closed session with attorneys for Ms.Sabol and the mother, who has not been identified.   Ms. Sabol claims she is entitled to parental rights because sheintended to have the child, planned for it, arranged for sperm to bedonated by one of her relatives, assisted with the artificialinsemination, paid child and spousal support after the baby was bornon Dec. 16, 1986, and parented the child until she and the motherbroke up.   Ms. Sabol, 32, has a court hearing March 30 to seek temporaryvisitation rights of the 2-year-old girl known as Baby B until thematter is resolved at trial.   Mitchell Jacobs, the mother's attorney, said his client will seekdismissal of the case at that hearing.   Ms. Sabol filed a lawsuit seeking joint custody after the29-year-old mother began to restrict her time with the child aftertheir break-up.</TEXT></DOC>
