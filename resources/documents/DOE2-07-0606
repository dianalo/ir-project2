It isshown that nitrogen, sulfur, carbon, ozone and organic chemistry whichalways involves hydroxy and hydroperoxy radicals is one single subjectarea that can be approached only as a whole. These reactions play a particularrole in the formation of photooxidizing agents and several acid componentsin the lower troposphere. Perfect understanding is therefore a prerequisitefor predicting the environmental impact of human product discharge intothe atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
