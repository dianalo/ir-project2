In his first full-dress news conference in four months, Reaganalso said he thought outside terrorists had been at work stirringup the Middle East violence on the West Bank that has prompted anIsraeli military crackdown.   The president said he had ``every confidence'' in the personalintegrity of embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III. But saidhe could not comment on reports of the investigation of Meese'srole in a proposed Middle East oil pipeline.   As is his custom, Reagan opened the nationally televised sessionin the White House East Room with a quip. ``On the networks atlast,'' he said in a wry reference to the refusal by CBS, NBC andABC to carry his prime-time Feb. 2 speech on the eve of a Housevote on aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   The news conference blended international affairs with thedomestic presidential campaign swirling outside the White Housegates, and Reagan showed his zest for political combat with a fewjabs at the field of Democratic contenders.   To hear them, he said, ``we're in an economic slump'' sufferingfrom a variety of ills. ``At the moment none of those things aretrue,'' he said.   ``So I just think, you know, the kids will play,'' he said aslaughter filled the room.   The president also confirmed anew that Vice President GeorgeBush expressed reservations during the Iran-Contra affair. But herefused to say precisely what Bush had told him.   On other topics, Reagan:   _Said Secretary of State George Shultz had given him an``encouraging'' report on his just-completed trip to the SovietUnion. During the talks in Moscow, Shultz and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze set a one-month deadline for armsnegotiators to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty tocurb strategic nuclear weapons.   _Noted that Shultz was embarking on a fresh peace-seekingmission to the Middle East, and said he hoped Israelis and Arabswould ``rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work''and begin serious negotiations.   _Issued a fresh condemnation of the leftist Sandinistagovernment of Nicaragua, and said the Soviet Union had doubledmilitary assistance to the nation in the first two months of thisyear over 1987 levels. He provided no figures.   _Said he had not decided whether to tell Congress that aidshould be resumed to Panama. He has to certify that Panama ishelping in anti-drug efforts, but Gen. Manuel Noriega, Panama'smilitary leader, has been indicted on U.S. drug-trafficking charges.   Reagan passed up several invitations to criticize Israeli actionagainst Arab protesters on the occipied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``We don't support that sort of thing,'' was as strong astatement as the president would make, but he added quickly thatthere was evidence that the riots that provoked an Israeli militarycrackdown were not ``spontaneous.''   Asked to elaborate, he said, ``We have had information thatthere have been certain people suspected of being terrorists,outsiders coming in and stirring up the trouble in those areas.''   He ducked a request for more information, replying that to saymore would ``get into areas that violate security.''   The subject of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson _nearly three years in captivity _ and the other American hostagesin Lebanon arose early in the 30-minute nationally televisedquestion-and-answer session.   ``We've never let up and we never will in trying to bringfreedom for all our hostages,'' Reagan said.   Asked about GOP candidate Robertson's claim that his ChristianBroadcasting Network had once known the location of some of thehostages and the administration may have missed a chance for arescue, the president said:   ``I can only say this. It would be very strange if he did haveinformation ... isn't it strange that no one in our administrationwas apprised of it.''   Reagan said he didn't want to become involved in the campaign tosucceed him in the White House, but he said, ``If he felt that he(Robertson) knew he kept it to himself.''   The president's statement on the Contras seemed to be a softappeal for support in Congress for fresh aid to the rebels. Henoted with regret that the Democratic-run House had rejected hiscall for $36.2 million in fresh aid to the Contra, including somemoney for weapons.   House leaders have scheduled a vote for next week on analternative support calling for humanitarian aid.   Reagan was unclear on a number of points. For example, he saidthat Soviet membershin||nt on Tariffs and Trade, is under review but hefailed to point out that the United States strenuously opposesSoviet participation.   He also said that Secretary of State George Shultz and formerDefense Secretary Caspar Weinberger did not object to the secretsale of arms to Iran on grounds that it was a trade of arms forhostages. However, the secretaries have said otherwise, and theIran-Contra report issued by two congressional committees saidShultz and Weinberger ``called it a straight arms-for-hostages dealthat was contrary to U.S. public policy.''   Reagan jockeyed a busy round of talks on foreign policy problemsWednesday with last-minute preparations for the news conference,the 42nd in his seven years as president but his first since lastOct. 22.   His first appointment Wednesday was with Shultz, who returnedfrom Moscow on Tuesday night after talks on arms control and thelikelihood of a Soviet pullout of military forces from Afghanistan.   Shultz headed out again Wednesday night, this time to the MiddleEast to try to spark Arab-Israeli peace talks. Shultz said inadvance he had only a slim chance of succeeding, and that the twosides would have to moderate their ``extreme positions.''   During the talks in Moscow, Shultz and Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze set a one-month deadline for arms negotiatorsto complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to curbstrategic nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
