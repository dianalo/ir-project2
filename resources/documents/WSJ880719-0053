Sales rose 7% to $1.82 billion from $1.69 billion.    In the automotive segment, operating profit climbed 28% to $82 million from $65 million on a 15% sales gain, to $797 million from $695 million. The Cleveland-based company said higher volume and improved performance in the market to foreign car makers helped boost operating profits.    Profits in the space and defense segment, at $58 million, were about flat with the year-ago quarter as improved operating earnings were offset by higher-than-expected costs on a development project, TRW said. Sales rose 11%.    In the information systems segment, operating profit fell 13% to $14 million from $16 million although sales edged up to $137 million.    For the six months, TRW said net rose 21% to $137 million, or $2.22 a share, from $113 million, or $1.84 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $3.62 billion from $3.38 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
