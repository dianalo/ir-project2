BankAmerica said it was reducing its &quot;reference rate&quot; by aquarter-point to 8.75%, effective today. The move was thefirst by any of the top 10 banks to lower the prime ratebelow 9% since a round of rate-slashing on Feb. 1.BankAmerica is the nation's second-largest bank with $110.7billion of assets.</LP><TEXT>   Other big East and West Coast banks surveyed yesterdaysaid they hadn't any immediate plans to follow suit, as theydid when BankAmerica broke ranks in early January by becomingthe first of the top banks to lower the prime rate below 10%.   The prime is the rate commercial banks charge their mostcredit-worthy customers, and banks, anxious to preserveprofit, had been generally reluctant to reduce it during1990.   In congressional testimony yesterday, Alan Greenspan,Federal Reserve Board chairman, indicated that the Fed isn'tcurrently seeking further reductions in interest rates. ButBankAmerica interpreted his comments as being lesspessimistic for rates than many in the industry had expected,and thus leaving the door open to a further decline in therate at which banks borrow from each other.   &quot;We regarded that as a favorable interest rateenvironment,&quot; said Frank E. McCormick, senior economist atBankAmerica.   While Mr. Greenspan's comments helped persuade BankAmericato take yesterday's action, Mr. McCormick said the underlyingreason was that the cost of funds to the banking system hasbeen declining.   Some analysts believe that BankAmerica is simply making amarketing decision to drop to a level below that of itscompetitors so it can attract some new loan business.   Support for this belief stems from the fact thatBankAmerica cut its rate a halfpoint Feb. 1 and that it isunusual for a bank to lower its prime at midmonth when it canaffect monthly revenue, said Donald Crowley, an analyst forthe firm of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.   &quot;I suspect B of A is probing for loan demand,&quot; Mr. Crowleyadded.   Whatever the reason, BankAmerica can well afford to takechances with its prime rate. One of the healthier banks,BankAmerica has generated robust earnings through its retailbranch networks in California and Washington state. And it isless encumbered than some of its competitors with exposure inthe disastrous commercial real estate market. The bank'sfourth-quarter earnings were up 6.3%, while profit for all of1990 rose 1.1%, Mr. Crowley said.   Though some other banks hedged on whether they will followBankAmerica in dropping below a 9% prime rate, Mr. Crowleysaid the betting was that they would do so only slowly,giving BankAmerica time to explore the sub -- 9% loan market.Mr. Crowley also figures that BankAmerica will stay at 8.75%until the rest of the industry follows.   A spokesman for Chemical Banking Corp. said it was thatbank's policy not to comment on actions of other banks anddeclined to comment on whether it would match the prime-ratedrop.   Officials of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bank ofNew York couldn't be reached for comment last night.</TEXT></DOC>
