State Department spokesman Richard Boucher made the announcementTuesday, shortly after President Bush told a White House newsconference that he hoped to end a decade-long estrangement fromTehran and that Iran could help free American hostages held inLebanon.   The U.S. government has offered to pay the families of the 290passengers and crew members who died July 3, 1988, when the USSVincennes shot down the Iranian airbus in the mistaken belief it wasan attacking F-14 fighter.   However, the United States has refused to give the compensationto the Iranian government, insisting that it go directly to therelatives.   ``We have not gotten an official response yet from Iran'' oncompensation, Boucher said. ``We continue to hope that Iran will dothe right thing for its citizens.''   Iran filed suit May 17 in the World Court, located at The Hagueand formally known as the International Court of Justice, allegingthat the United States violated the Seattle and Montreal conventionson civil aviation. The lawsuit demands payment.   No date for the trial has been set.   U.S. attorneys argue that civil aviation conventions don't applyto the Vincennes, which was protecting shipping in the Persian Gulfduring the Iran-Iraq war. Iran pulled out of the war shortly afterthe jetliner was shot down.   ``In this case, the USS Vincennes acted on the belief that theairliner was a hostile military aircraft,'' Boucher said. ``The merefact that this belief was erroneous does not make the act of theVincennes unlawful.''   Boucher, asked whether the U.S. decision to participate in thecase means that Washington will respect any ruling by the court,said:   ``I don't think you can say it is an irrevocable decision bindingus to whatever happens. We have the inherent right of self-defense.We wouldn't accept limitations on that right.''   The decision to argue the suit, Boucher said, ``shows the U.S.desire to work within the court. ... It shows our willingness tosupport the work of the court in appropriate cases.''   The decision was disclosed against the backdrop of efforts torestore diplomatic relations with Tehran and win Iranian help infreeing American hostages.   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of ourlives,'' Bush said. ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted thosehostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood thatthat would happen, perhaps not with certainty, but a goodlikelihood.''   The Reagan administration dubbed the 15-member panel a``propaganda forum'' in 1984, when Nicaragua took the United Statesto court to seek an injunction against U.S. support for the Contras.   The United States walked out halfway through the proceedings,saying the court had no jurisdiction. After 17 months, the courtordered an immediate halt to all American aid to the Contras.   The court is reviewing a Nicaraguan demand for U.S. compensationfor damages inflicted by the rebels during their seven-yearinsurgency. The United States isn't participating in that procedure.   ``We did appear in the Nicaragua case in order to enable thecourt to determine whether it has jurisdiction,'' Boucher said.``The court's decision in that case we found to be untenable.''   Since the 1985 walkout, the United States has been involved intwo other cases, losing both times.   The court ruled last month that Italian authorities had legallyconfiscated the Sicilian branch of a U.S. electronics company in thelate 1960s. In 1988, the Reagan administration suffered a defeatwhen the court ruled that Washington's plan to close down the U.N.mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization in New Yorkviolated international law.</TEXT></DOC>
