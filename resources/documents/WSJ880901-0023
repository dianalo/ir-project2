The bureau also said the inflation-adjusted median income of all families grew for the fifth year in a row, finally topping the record set in 1973. But after adjusting for inflation, the income of black and Hispanic families fell last year, but those declines weren't statistically significant.    These and other figures from a 62,000-household survey conducted by the Census Bureau describe a flourishing economy in which the fruits of prosperity aren't equally shared by all Americans.    &quot;The economic recovery is leaving many poor Americans behind,&quot; said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a private research group. The White House viewed the report differently. &quot;The growing economy has indeed lifted the standard of living for everyone,&quot; said Marlin Fitzwater, President Reagan's spokesman.    Altogether, the Census report said 32.5 million Americans were living below the poverty line in 1987, up from 32.4 million, or 13.6%, the previous year. But neither the increase in the number of poor people nor the decline in the poverty rate was big enough to be statistically significant.    After dropping steadily for years, the U.S. poverty rate hit a low of 11.1% in 1973 and leveled off. It turned up sharply in 1980, peaked at 15.2% in 1983 and has been moving downward since. Still, the poverty rate remains higher than for any year in the 1970s, including the 1974-75 recession, and there were more Americans living in poverty in 1987 than in 1967.    &quot;The 1980s have been a terrible decade for the poor in America despite overall progress in unemployment and the economy,&quot; said Robert Fersh of the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center. The average unemployment rate in 1987 was about the same as in 1978, but the poverty rate was substantially lower, at 11.4%, in 1978.    Among whites, the poverty rate dropped to 10.5% from 11%. But among blacks, it rose sharply to 33.1% from 31.1%, reversing improvements of recent years. Among Hispanics, the poverty rate rose to 28.2% from 27.3%, but the Census Bureau said the increase wasn't statistically significant.    The increase in the poverty rate among blacks was the first since 1982. &quot;One year is simply too little time to know whether some new phase . . . has been reached,&quot; said William Butz, associate director of the Census Bureau. While the poverty rate among minorities is high, nearly two-thirds of all poor people are white.    In measuring poverty, the Census Bureau ignores such non-cash government aid as food stamps. The poverty line reflects the government's estimate of the cost of feeding a family &quot;minimally adequately&quot; and determines eligibility for certain government programs. It is adjusted each year for inflation. For a family of four, the line was raised in 1987 to $11,611 from $11,203 in 1986.    The Census Bureau also said:   --Poverty among people living on farms fell drastically to 12.6% in 1987 from 19.6% in 1986, the first time the poverty rate has been lower among farmers than among the overall population. Mr. Butz said this doesn't reflect an exodus of poor people from farms, but rather appears to reflect &quot;an improvement in the farm economy.&quot;    --The median income of all families rose 1% to $30,850 after adjusting for inflation. For white families, income climbed 1.1% to $32,274. Among black families, income fell 0.8% to $18,098. Among Hispanic families, income slipped 2% to $20,306.    --Although median family income in the South still lags behind the rest the country, the gap narrowed in 1987 as the median income in the South rose 2% to $28,250. Income in other regions didn't increase significantly.    --Per capita income rose 1.6% to $12,287 in 1987, a record high even after adjusting for inflation.    --The gap between earnings of men and women narrowed in 1987, but not significantly. Women who worked full-time and year-round earned 65 cents for every dollar earned by men, up from 64 cents in 1986. After adjusting for inflation, median earnings of male workers dropped 0.7% to $26,008, while earnings of female workers rose 0.5% to $16,909.    --The distribution of income, which has been increasingly unequal in the past 20 years, didn't change substantially in 1987. The richest 20% of all families (those with incomes above $52,910) got 43.7% of all income, while the poorest 20% (those with incomes below $14,450) got 4.6% of all income. The proportions were unchanged from 1986.    --Last year 20% of all children in the U.S. lived in poverty, and the poverty rate among black children was 45.8%. In contrast, 12.2% of Americans over age 65 were living below the poverty line.    ---                    Poverty Rate 1978-1987    % of all persons below poverty line    YEAR          TOTAL          WHITES          BLACKS    1987          13.5%           10.5%           33.1%    1986          13.6            11.0            31.1    1985          14.0            11.4            31.3    1984          14.4            11.5            33.8    1983          15.2            12.1            35.7    1982          15.0            12.0            35.6    1981          14.0            11.1            34.2    1980          13.0            10.2            32.5    1979          11.7             9.0            31.0    1978          11.4             8.7            30.6    Source: Census Bureau</TEXT></DOC>
