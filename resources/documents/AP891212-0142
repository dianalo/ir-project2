Working on a stack of legislation left by Congress before itleft town, Bush also signed a bill to require all schools receivingfederal aid to adopt programs designed to prevent the use ofillicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol by students.   ``I believe these provisions will assist significantly ourstruggle to rid our nation's schools of drug and alcohol abuse andeducate our young to the legal, social and health consequences ofsuch abuse,'' Bush said in a statement.   In addition, he signed a measure that authorizes spending $127million over four years to hire 700 new police officers in theDistrict of Colombia, which has one of the nation's highesthomicide rates.   In signing the bill restricting foreign arms sales, Bush said,``I wish to reemphasize this nation's strong determination tooppose international terrorists and the states that support them.   ``Curbing state support to terrorists is essential in reducingthe menace of international terrorism,'' Bush said.   Federal law bans the export of military arms to countries foundguilty of international terrorism, a designation the United Statesapplies to Libya, Iran, Syria, South Yemen, Cuba and North Korea.   In 1986, the law was amended to authorize a waiver of the ban ifthe president makes a determination that such action is in thenational interest and so notifies Congress.   By late 1985, however, the United States already had startedsecretly shipping arms to Iran through Israel in what was judged tobe an attempt to win the release of American hostages held inLebanon. In January 1986, then-President Reagan secretly authorizedthe sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.   Congress was not notified of the shipments until Nov. 25, 1986,when the White House announced that arms had been sold to Iran andthat the profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   The new restrictions on arms sales, intended to close loopholesin the law, require the president to report and consult withCongress before the actual export of military goods to terroristcountries.   In signing the measure, Bush said he would interpret the law``as placing no limit on our negotiations and communications withforeign governments.''</TEXT></DOC>
