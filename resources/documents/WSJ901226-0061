While many traders and investors found ample reason Mondaynot to be in their offices, the diehards who showed up weredecidedly pessimistic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost12.37 points to close at 2621.29 in a short pre-holidaytrading session. Bond traders bid the prices of long-termTreasury bonds down. The only bright spot was in the foreignexchange market, where the dollar posted gains against boththe mark and the yen.</LP><TEXT>   Traders said weekend saber rattling spooked investorsMonday. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said Saturdaythat &quot;the clock is ticking&quot; quickly toward a war in theMiddle East. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, saidTel Aviv will be Iraq's first target if war breaks out. Andin Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the danger ofwar &quot;is very close.&quot; Adding to concerns was Iraq's recall ofits ambassadors to the U.S. and United Nations for talks inIraq.   In the bond market, the war worries combined with year-endprofit-taking to drive prices of long-term Treasury bondsdown sharply. The more popular short-term debt securitieswere off only modestly, even though the bond market isbracing for the sale later this week of a record $12.5billion of two-year Treasury notes and a record $8.5 billionof four-year notes. Thin trading volume exacerbated thedownward trend, analysts said.   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was thin, too.Volume on the Big Board totaled a mere 57.2 million shares,eclipsing the previous slowest day of the year when 63.4million shares traded on the day after Thanksgiving. Thestock exchange closed at 2 p.m. Monday, two hours earlierthan usual.   Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst with his own researchfirm, said that despite the down day on Christmas Eve, thestock market hasn't performed badly in recent weeks.&quot;Everyone is sitting around pooh-poohing this as a bearmarket rally, but it is a 10% rally&quot; from the October lows.What's more, he said, so far this year the market is down amere 1% on a total return basis, which takes into accountdividends as well as price changes. &quot;It hasn't been all thatbad a year,&quot; he said.   &quot;Overall, we're seeing some positive things,&quot; he said.&quot;The people on Wall Street are very negative, but if you lookat how well many investors did in 1990, all the negative newsgets confusing.&quot;   Even all the concern about the Middle East doesn't seem tohave a very damping effect on stocks, he said. &quot;The MiddleEast is obviously a question mark, but if you look at theprices of crude oil and gold as a proxy for investor concernabout the Middle East, you would have to think the market isrelatively unconcerned.&quot; Gold prices are almost unchangedsince the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August and, while theprice of oil shot up as high as $40 a barrel, it has sincefallen to about $27, up from a 12-month low of about $15.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices fell. Declining issues on the Big Boardoutpaced gainers, 842 to 527.                                                                                                          Bond prices were down sharply. The Treasury's benchmark30-year bond lost seven-eighths of a point, or about $8.75for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue roseto 8.36%.                                                                                                          The dollar gained. In New York trading the currency wasquoted at 1.5440 marks and 136.00 yen, compared with 1.5289marks and 135.55 yen Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
