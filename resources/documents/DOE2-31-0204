Effectiveness per unit dose of X or {gamma} rays (low-LETradiations) has been consistently observed to be dependent on the temporaldistribution of dose. In a series of comparisons, 0.5 Gy of single orfractionated (five fractions in 8 h), neutrons of 0.23, 0.35, 0.45, 5.9,or 13.7 MeV were delivered to a synchronous C3H 10T1/2 cells. Transformationfrequencies per surviving cell are shown. Cells exposed to one energy(5.9 MeV) show a significant enhancement at the 95% level due to fractionatedexposures, and at the 85% confidence level the 0.35- and 0.45-MeV fractionatedexposures additionally result in significantly greater transformationfrequencies. The frequencies of surviving cells per dish between a singleor fractionated exposure vary by less than 10%. In three of five pairwisecomparisons, fractionated exposures result in statistically greater frequenciesof transformants per dish, and are in complete agreement with the resultswhen induction is expressed as transformants per surviving cell. However,after 0.23-MeV neutron irradiation, the single dose resulted in a greaterincidence of transformed foci than the fractionated dose.</TEXT></DOC>
