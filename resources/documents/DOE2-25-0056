From this point of view, the report discusses the relationsof risks and decision making for investment, and presents a cash flowanalysis to determine whether the differences in objectives between themajor oil companies and investment-receiving countries can be interpretedin terms of the differences in their handling of risks. Based on theseconsiderations, the report proposes an optimum income sharing schemefor oil exploitation projects in Sudan. Contracts for oil explorationand exploitation are also discussed. A resource rent tax system is proposedto overcome problems associated with traditional financial conditions.A simulation study is made to compare the proposed resource rent taxsystem and the production sharing system on the basis of data on twooil fields in Sudan. It is concluded that although not in a satisfactoryform at present, the proposed resource rent tax system, if improved,will provide a highly effective tool for exploitation by oil companies.(5 figs, 2 tabs, 20 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
