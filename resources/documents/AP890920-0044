If somebody today claims that in terms of national developmentand inter-ethnic relationships Soviet power has not wroughtessential changes as compared to the situation in pre-revolutionaryRussia, he is engaged in dishonest distortion of reality intended towhip up nationalistic passions and to motivate various extremistdemands.   There are no grounds to question the decision by the Balticrepublics to join the U.S.S.R. and the choice made by their peoples.   It is also clear that the Soviet leadership, taking a variety ofmeasures to strengthen the country's security in the face of theNazi threat, committed gross violations of the Leninist principlesof foreign policy which rejects division into spheres of influence.We resolutely condemn this.   The outrages against ethnic groups and their banishment fromtheir native parts during the Great Patriotic War must be condemned.We should do everything to restore the flouted rights of the SovietGermans, Crimean Tatars, Meskhetian Turks, Kalmyks, Balkars,Karachais, Chechens, Ingushes, Greeks, Koreans, and Kurds.</TEXT><TEXT>   From this point of view, the gamut of measures affected as partof perestroika means a new and landmark stage in implementingnations' rights to self-determination.   In present-day conditions the principle is best reflected inself-management, protecting ethnic identity and the right of eachethnic group to enjoy all the fruits of sovereignty and to decideall issues of its development _ economic, political and cultural _as it sees fit.</TEXT><TEXT>   The current phase in the self-determination of nations makes itimperative to markedly broaden the rights of republics anddecisively remove the distortions and deformities of the past, whoseadverse effects are still being felt in various areas of society'slife.   While the union will retain the powers needed to perform thecommon tasks of the federation, it is proposed to make fundamentalchanges to earlier procedures whereby the union had the right totake up and decide virtually any issue, making the competence andsovereignty of republican authorities in many ways a mere formality.   To embark now on recarving the country's administrative andterritorial map would mean only complicating what is already adifficult solution, to delay indefinitely the attainment of the realgoals of perestroika, which aim to imrove the life of the whole ofthe Soviet people, all nations.   Our new nationality policy is designed to provide broadpossibilities for meeting the specific interests of every nation andat the same time strengthening the guarantees of citizens' rights,irrespective of their nationality.   We encounter ever increasing attempts by enemies of perestroika,anti-social elements and groups to play `the nationalist card,' tochannel people's displeasure, which has accumulated over decades,into the sphere of inter-ethnic relations. Any manifestation ofnationalism and chauvinism, or the instigation of enmity to anynation are unacceptable to us.</TEXT><TEXT>   In modern conditions ... attempts by relatively prosperousrepublics and regions to isolate themselves and fence themselves offwould be extremely dangerous. This can bring fairly negativeconsequences for those who embark on this road.   We need at this plenary meeting to say this once again in theface of all peoples of the Soviet Union so that they do not give into demagogues, who conceal what the implementation of their slogans,served under the `pleasant sauce' of independence, secession, etc.,may lead to. This is irresponsible gambling with the destinies ofthe people.</TEXT><TEXT>   We are on the correct path and we should be firm in defending thechief directions of the policy of perestroika. It is being claimedthat we are unable to resolve problems facing the country withoutintroducing capitalism into the economy.   On the other hand, I would say from the right, it is beingclaimed that the entire policy of perestroika was imposed on us bythe West. This is nonsense.</TEXT></DOC>
