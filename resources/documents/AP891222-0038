President Daniel Ortega said earlier Thursday that ``if the U.S.government withdraws the armored cars and troops that surround theNicaraguan Embassy, then we will respond in the same way here.''   A curfew was in effect in Panama City and it was not immediatelyknown if the U.S. troops left the Nicaraguan and Cuban missions.   Associated Press photographers in Managua saw at least sevenSoviet-made T-55 tanks, three armored personnel carriers and threetrucks of anti-aircraft weapons leave the embassy between 9:30 and10:30 p.m. (10:30 and 11:30 EST).   Embassy spokesman Lou Falino said people at the embassy heardthe noise of several engines ``but they could not determine if thetanks were withdrawn because it was dark.'' He was contacted at hishome.   American armored cars, part of a U.S. invading force, surroundedthe Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama City Thursday afterrumors spread that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was hiding in one ofthe two missions.   ``We have ordered exactly that the same thing be done here,around the U.S. Embassy, as was done in Panama City,'' ForeignMinister Miguel D'Escoto told a news conference. He indicated hewas holding the United States responsible for the safety ofNicaraguan diplomats in Panama.   Reporters in Managua saw the Soviet-made T-55 tanks and armoredcarriers brought in Thursday afternoon and parked, partiallyhidden, behind the U.S. Embassy.   Each vehicle was manned by a crew of six and armed with amachine gun and a light cannon. Col. Julio Ramos of the armygeneral staff personally supervised the deployment shortly aftermidday.   An AP photographer at the scene said at first the armoredcarriers were pointing their machine guns and cannon away from theembassy compound. But an officer ordered the crews to keep theweapons aimed at the mission.   Asked for comment, Ramos said he was acting ``on higher orders,for reasons already explained by Foreign Minister D'Escoto.'' Butan unidentified officer, interviewed live by state radio, said``this is in response for what they are doing to us now in Panama.''   ``They have just surrounded our embassy in Panama, and theythink we are going to remain here with our arms crossed?'' theofficer added.   D'Escoto told reporters Nicaragua has demanded ``the immediatewithdrawal of the invading, imperialist U.S. military presencearound our diplomatic mission in the independent and sovereignRepublic of Panama.''   ``As soon as they dismantle their deployment there, we are goingto do the same here _ so, we are going to wait until they becomereasonable,'' D'Escoto added, calling the American encirclment ofthe embassies in Panama City ``an act of intimidation.''   He said there were women and children, as well as diplomats,inside the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama.   Soviet-made T-55 tanks, guns, mortars and antiaircraft cannonwere in place all over Managua and in other strategic locationsaround the country early Wednesday, hours after American troopsinvaded Panama to oust and try to capture Noriega.   The deposed strongman is wanted in the United States ondrug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.   Nicaraguan officials said the measures were taken in case theUnited States instigates military action against this country.   For many years, Sandinista spokesmen have been saying the UnitedStates intends to invade Nicaragua. U.S. officials have persistenlydenied this.   Charge d'affaires John Leonard has been the senior diplomat heresince Ambassador Richard Melton was expelled July 11, 1988, afterthe ruling leftist Sandinistas accused him of interfering inNicaragua's internal affairs.   Relations between the Sandinista government and the UnitedStates have been steadily deteriorating since 1980, about a yearafter the Sandinistas came to power, when they established militaryties with Cuba and the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
