A headline in Barricada, the Sandinista newspaper, said: ``TheOrder Of The Day: Intensify Combat.''   Honduras said the raids Thursday were confined to its ownterritory, aimed at Nicaraguan soldiers it said crossed thefrontier the day before in pursuit of Contra rebels.   The Sandinista government continued with plans for cease-firetalks with the Contras next Monday, but the U.S.-supported rebelswere considering a boycott.   Cease-fires in the region's civil wars, and a ban on the use ofone country's territory for attacks on another, are provisions ofthe peace plan signed Aug. 7 by five Central American presidents.   Nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to roust Contrasfrom camps along the Honduran border Wednesday but was maintainingcombat positions.   Although the Defense Ministry said none of the soldiers enteredHonduras, a Nicaraguan military source indicated privately thatthey had.   Honduran officials and the Reagan administration say Sandinistasoldiers crossed the rugged, ill-defined border about 175 milesfrom Managua.   On Thursday, the United States started flying 3,200 soldiers ofthe 82nd Airborne Division and 7th Light Infantry to Honduras in ashow of support. Defense Secretary said they would be on a trainingexercise there for 10 days but would stay out of combat.   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops would take on theAmericans if necessary.   He hedged the question of whether Nicaraguan soldiers crossedthe Coco River in the isolated northern region, as he has whenprevious incursions were reported.   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduranterritory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenaryforces in Honduran territory ... tolerated by the Hondurangovernment,'' he said Thursday.   Honduran warplanes bombed the Bocay border region, whereNicaragua's northern military headquarters is located. The Hondurangovernment said a Soviet-supplied Nicaraguan helicopter wasdestroyed but the Defense Ministry denied the claim.   Journalists taken to the area earlier Thursday saw and felt abomb explode at the confluence of the Bocay and Coco rivers. Lt.Col. Javier Carrion, commander of the offensive against theContras, said two bombs fell in Nicaraguan territory and one on theHonduran side.   Carrion told reporters in a jungle clearing at San Andres deBocay that 4,500 soldiers were involved in the sweep through anarea running from central Nicaragua to the frontier. He said theyhad air support from Soviet-supplied helicopter gunships and An-26propeller-driven planes carrying bombs.   He said Sandinista troops had killed 92 Contras and wounded 300,at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded.   The colonel said the purpose was to destroy Contra bases in theborder area, which is about 40 miles from an important miningregion the rebels attacked in December.   Honduras said about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers crossed theborder, and a high-ranking military officer said about half of themstill were there Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
