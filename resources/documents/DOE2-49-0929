This can be established by translation of themRNA of interest in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system. MessengerRNA protein product identification is important in the isolation of aparticular mRNA species for cDNA cloning and in the identification ofpositive cDNA clones. The two high-activity translation systems in commonuse are those prepared from rabbit reticulocytes and from wheat germ.Both systems are easy to prepare, and both are available commercially.Each has advantages and disadvantages over the other and a choice betweenthe two will depend on the type of mRNAs to be translated, the prejudicesof experience, and availability. The main disadvantage of the reticulocytesystem is that it requires removal of endogenous mRNA. However, thisis a relatively simple procedure. The wheat germ system does not requireremoval of endogenous mRNA and may translate weakly initiating mRNAsmore efficiently. However, ionic optima for translation in the wheatgerm system are more sensitive to the nature and concentration of mRNAand may need to be determined for each template. The biggest problemwith the use of the wheat germ system is its tendency to produce incompletetranslation products due to premature termination.</TEXT></DOC>
