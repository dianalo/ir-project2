A total of 306,202 visitors came to the park in January andFebruary, an increase of 43 percent from the 213,384 who came inthe same months last year.   Lion Country Safari, the Palm Beach County big-game preserve andamusement park, shows a 25 percent boost over last year.   ``We were so busy over the Washington Birthday weekend, I stoodout all afternoon directing traffic,'' said Lion Country marketingdirector Brian Osborne. ``We had a 4-mile-long line of traffic inthe park.''   Ocean World, where Fort Lauderdale visitors can pet dolphins andwatch sharks feed, reports 18 percent more visitors this season.   South Florida tourist officials are unable to estimate the totalnumber of foreign tourists, but international traffic at MiamiInternational Airport was 786,951 passengers in January, up 9percent over January 1987's total.   ``We're something different than they've got back home in Europeand Japan,'' said Jerome Scherr, president of Miami's ParrotJungle, where attendance was up 16 percent from January to January.``We're subtropical _ palm trees and glamour.''   Nigel and Rosy Collins visited Miami's Seaquarium from London.   ``Everything is so warm, so clean, so new, so cheap,'' Collinssaid, as his wife chimed in, ``And you've got Don Johnson.''   They expected their weeklong trip to South Florida and Orlandoto cost barely half of what they would have paid two years agobecause of the dollar's decline against foreign currencies.   `You have a truly unique place,'' said Klaus Mueller, a Germanwho was bird watching at Everglades National Park. ``Everybody inthe world knows about the Everglades.''   Businesses that thrive on tourism expect the boom to continue aslong as the dollar is low.   ``The English should be here big in April,'' Scherr said. SouthAmericans will then travel north to avoid winter, and Europeanswill keep coming.   Finley expects Europeans to generate 80 percent of the businessat Flamingo Lodge at the southern tip of the park in themosquito-swarming months of July and August.   Meanwhile, the traditional spring break market that put FortLauderdale on the map is in decline. Broward County tourismofficials had been expecting 200,000 vacationing collegians butsaid Sunday they now expect only 110,000 to 180,000 _ the smallestcrowd this decade.</TEXT></DOC>
