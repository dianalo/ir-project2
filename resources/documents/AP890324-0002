(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 50-pound mountain lion was seizedThursday in a one-bedroom Long Island apartment, where it had spentthe last few months ``running around, bouncing off the furniture,''a state spokesman said.   ``It was fully clawed, not an ideal pet for an apartment,'' saidScott Florence, an officer with the state Department ofEnvironmental Conservation.   He said the owner, whose name was not made public but who livedin Deer Park, ``called our wildlife unit last Monday and said hewanted to turn the cat in.''   The owner said he had bought it as a 3-month-old kitten and``thought it would be a neat thing to have'' but then it apparentlyoutgrew its cuteness, Florence said. The owner was charged withpossession of an endangered species.   ``The cat was just being kept in his apartment,'' Florence said.``He kept it in a small room. He put it on a leash when we gotthere.''   ``He had a dog in there and the 50-pound mountain lion in thererunning around, bouncing off the furniture,'' said Greg Drossel,general manager of the Long Island Game Farm in Manorville, wherethe cougar was taken.   ``She's in very good shape, like a big tabby.'' He said the cat,6 months old and 18 inches high, about a third of its full-grownsize, had all its teeth.   Drossel said the farm would keep the cat as a favor for the stateuntil the DEC decided what to do with it. ``It's not like they couldtake it to Bide-A-Wee and hope some one adopts it,'' Drossel said.</TEXT></DOC>
