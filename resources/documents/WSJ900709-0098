In &quot;Lawyers and Thieves: Legal Shenanigans, CourtroomScandal, and the Endless Hunt for Money&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster,224 pages, $19.95), by New York attorney Roy Grutman withBill Thomas, a former reporter for the Baltimore Sun, we getboth, beginning with the opening line. &quot;My mother has suedeveryone in our family but me,&quot; writes Mr. Grutman. He iseager to prove the legal system is more like waste treatmentthan justice.</LP><TEXT>   As Mr. Grutman tells it, the book is not about attorneyshopping but &quot;about how much they cost, in money, time andtrouble,&quot; and not about ethics &quot;but about the constantcompetition for cases that keeps the courts clogged and makessure lawyers are always on the prowl.&quot;   Some of the lawyers he describes are Louis Nizer (a&quot;shrunken head in a three-piece suit&quot;), Edward BennettWilliams (whose clients included John Connally and JimmyHoffa), Gerry Spence (who just walked Imelda Marcos out ofracketeering and fraud charges) and Melvin Belli (the agedking of torts, whose &quot;stewardess wives&quot; and son Caesar Mr.Grutman loves to disparage).   According to Mr. Grutman, one of the truisms about lawyersis that they will represent anyone. After all, he himself hasrepresented pornographers and preachers, and for 18 yearshandled cases for Penthouse. Another client was the Rev.Jerry Falwell, who hired Mr. Grutman to go after Hustlerpublisher Larry Flynt although the Moral Majority leader hadalready tangled unhappily with Penthouse in court.   &quot;Clearly he understood the most essential truth about thelegal profession,&quot; writes Mr. Grutman. &quot;A lawyer is autensil, like a knife or fork. It doesn't make any differencewho ate with it last, only that it was sufficiently sanitizedbetween meals.&quot;   Now with the firm of Grutman, Greene andamp; Humphrey, Mr.Grutman shares other insights dating from 1950spersonal-injury scams in the Bronx to his time with Finley,Kumble, the megafirm that collapsed in a mountain of debt andegos. At Finley, Kumble for six years starting in 1970, Mr.Grutman writes he was there while firm head Stephen Kumble&quot;proceeded to turn the practice of law from a profession intoa bicoastal bait-and-switch operation.&quot;   Elsewhere in the book, he insists that &quot;of course, not alllawyers are thieves.&quot; But Mr. Grutman is not shy aboutbashing lawyers like Mr. Belli for suing on behalf of a deadman.   Switching to corporate law, Mr. Grutman discusses New Yorktakeover-specialist Joseph Flom of Skadden, Arps, who he sayswould never be confused with an ambulance chaser. &quot;Yet everyyear Flom earns between $3 million and $5 million cleaning upafter corporate collisions.&quot;   While not naming names, he likes to remind people thatthere are overbillings galore in law. And in an amusing pieceof advice, Mr. Grutman suggests caution about starting legalaction, especially libel. &quot;Think of the worst thing thatcould be said about you. Now imagine hearing it announced ina courtroom by an attorney with a very loud voice whose jobit is to tear you to shreds.&quot;   Among the problems with this book is that when anecdotesgive way to general discussion, the prose goes dry. And Mr.Grutman often inflates his ego a notch or three. Returning toMr. Belli, Mr. Grutman boasts of representing Mr. Falwellduring the PTL scandal when Mr. Belli handled Jim and TammyBakker. &quot;By the time the two of us met on TV . . . even Bellimust have realized that the more exposure the case got theless his clients benefited . . . he stalked off the set in ahuff.&quot;   Mr. Grutman is mostly on the mark though in his discussionof the jury system. Noting that it thrives on an uninformedpopulace, he writes that at the trial of Oliver North,lawyers sought jurors with little knowledge of theIran-Contra affair. &quot;Was this a jury of North's peers or across-section of global-village idiots?&quot;   He also attacks a favorite target of lawyers -- insurancecompanies -- saying insurance commissions are stocked withex-insurance people &quot;the same way the Russians send KGBagents to work at the U.N.&quot;   After doing his share of trashing his own profession, Mr.Grutman tries to redeem it a bit, recalling the words of thelate Mr. Williams, who won cases no one else would take: &quot;Nodoctor worthy of the name turns away a patient . . . noclergyman . . . turns away a suppliant sinner . . . only alawyer is expected to turn away a client because societyregards him as . . . obnoxious.&quot;   Nonetheless, writes Mr. Grutman sadly, the system has itsinequities. &quot;Plenty of legal help is available for someonewho wants to file a multimillion-dollar lawsuit. If yousimply happen to be the victim of a crime, you are on yourown.&quot;   While the book is entertaining, one is left with severalquestions, including which lawyer may sue Mr. Grutman first.More important, if the legal system is such a low way ofearning a living, why is Mr. Grutman still hanging out hisshingle?   ---   Mr. Blum is a reporter for the National Law Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
