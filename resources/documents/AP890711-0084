At least twopeople were killed, dozens injured and hundreds left homeless.   National Guardsmen and police dogs searched through tangles offlattened homes and toppled trees today for victims in Connecticut,although there were no residents reported missing.   A heat wave, meanwhile, scorched the Midwest and at least threecities opened ``cooling centers'' to give residents an escape fromtemperatures that hovered around 100 degrees Monday. No relief wasin sight, and officials in Illinois worried about drought. Heat wasa factor in one death in St. Louis.   In the Northeast, tornadoes struck from northern New Jersey tocentral Massachusetts. Hardest hit were coastal Connecticut and twosoutheastern New York towns and a Long Island village. Thousandswere left without electricity.   Scattered thunderstorms boomed over southeastern New York,southern Connecticut and northern New Jersey. In a half-hour, 4.4inches of rain poured in Oxford, Conn. Golfball-sized hail wasreported in several spots.   ``This is the worst storm I've seen in 20 years of forecasting,''said Mel Goldstein, director of the Weather Center at WesternConnecticut State University in Danbury. ``It's a major disaster forthat region.''   As a precautionary measure, state police with trained dogssearched for people who might have been trapped in the rubble.Utility workers raced to cut off live wires and gas leaks whilescores of state police tried to seal off dangerous areas.   Twelve-year-old Jennifer Bike was killed when a tree fell on hertent at Black Rock State Park in Watertown Monday night and threeother girls inside were injured, police said. Two of the girlsremained in Waterbury Hospital early today in stable condition.   A man died in New York City when he stepped into a puddle thatwas electrified by exposed wires at an excavation site.   Elizabeth Ferri, 40, of New Fairfield, Conn., was struck in thehead by lightning while walking her dog in the front yard. She wasknocked unconscious, but was was sent home from the hospital aftertreatment.   Hospitals in Waterbury and New Haven alone treated about 75people, most of them for cuts and bruises. A 4-year-old New Havenboy who fell from a second-floor window was in critical conditionwith head injuries.   In Waterbury, Conn., the storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees onthe city green, and bent the tip of a flagpole. Streets werelittered with glass.   Mayor Joseph Santopietro imposed a 10 p.m. curfew.   John Calamo, deputy director of civil preparedness in Hamden,said 40 to 60 homes suffered heavy damage but no major injuries werereported. The storm also did major damage to an industrial park, a16-unit townhouse condominium and an auto body shop and the 25 carsinside.   ``There's probably three-quarters of a square mile ofdevastation,'' he said.   Brian Johnson, a tenant at the condominium, said the tornadodemolished his kitchen and sent kitchen knives flying into hisliving room. ``My neighbor found her refrigerator in her livingroom,'' he said.   More than 112,000 people in northwestern and southern Connecticutwere without power, said spokesmen for Northeast Utilities andUnited Illuminating.   Fifty miles north of New York City, a tornado overturned cars anddamaged homes in Carmel and Southeast township. Officials declared astate of emergency for all of Putnam County.   At a condominium complex in Carmel, 70 units were damaged, halfof them severely, said the county's public information officer, KenLott. Dozens were left homeless.   ``You're looking at these condos and the front walls are justgone,'' said Eric Gross of Carmel, a radio station reporter for WVIPin Mount Kisco. ``You can look in and see their furniture on thesecond floor.'' No serious injuries were reported.   On Long Island, a tornado roared through Spadaro Airport in EastMoriches, hurling a trailer into the air and dropping it in piecesacross the airfield, witnesses said.   A man inside the trailer, which served as a skydiving school, wasblown out and treated for cuts at a hospital.   The wind picked a small plane off the runway and dumped it upsidedown away into woods 100 feet away. Several other planes also weredamaged.   In Suffolk and Nassau counties, the tornado and a second stormknocked out power to 57,000 Long Island Lighting Co., but the lightswere back on in all but 5,000 homes by 5 a.m., said utilityspokeswoman Sue Roschak.   In Massachusetts, a series of ``mini-tornadoes'' _ small twisters50 to 100 feet in length _ knocked out power and telephones, felledtrees and damaged homes in the Princeton, Steling and West Boylstonareas.   Most of the damage was in woods, said the National WeatherService.   In New Jersey, twisters left behind downed electrical wires andfallen trees, but no injuries were reported. One tornado was spottednear the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River.   The Midwest's heat spurred officials to open cooling centers, orlarge air-conditioned rooms, in Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati.   High temperatures Monday included 101 degrees in Chicago; 100 inMoline and Rockford, Ill.; 98 degrees in St. Louis; and 97 degreesin Peoria, Ill.   Weather officials at the Quad City Airport in Moline said Mondaywas the 28th consecutive day without measurable rain _ tying arecord for rainless stretches during a growing season that was setin July and August of 1947.   Lake Michigan was popular: more than 240,000 people sought reliefat Chicago beaches Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
