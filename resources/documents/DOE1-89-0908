A specific role of diesel exhaust emissions was uncertain.The earlier studies were essentially negative; but they all sufferedfrom deficiencies, which made it hard to draw firm conclusions. shortduration of follow-up, uncertainty about exposures, and above all, inadequateallowance for cigarette smoking were common to all the earlier studies.Others attempted to remedy the short follow-up period of the study ofthe London busmen. He showed that even after 25 years there was no differencein lung cancer mortality between those in the highest and lowest dieselemission categories. But the other deficiencies remained: Exposures werelargely unmeasured, differences in exposure between the various occupationalgroups may not have been large, those who left the industry were notobserved and nothing was reported about smoking habits. The authors'conclusion from the literature is that while the evidence is accumulatingthat truckers, bus drivers, and others with potential occupational exposureto diesel exhaust emissions may have some increased risk of bladder cancer,we are by no means convinced that the increased risk is due to dieselexposure or indeed, even to occupation. The authors' observations ofa group of truck drivers who were interviewed at a truck stop supportthis view.</TEXT></DOC>
