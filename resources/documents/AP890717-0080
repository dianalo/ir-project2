Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., referred to a nine-page letter fromPresident Reagan's HUD secretary, Samuel Pierce, to DRG FundingCorp. lifting restrictions that had been placed on DRG forviolations of department rules.   ``When you read this letter you will share my pained amusement,''Lantos told Mrs. Hills, now the government's top trade official,during questioning before his Government Operations subcommittee onemployment and housing.   The restrictions were lifted after Mrs. Hills, who was employedas a lawyer for DRG from 1981 to 1984, met with Pierce and other HUDofficials on the company's behalf.   ``What came out of the meeting was one of the most remarkable(developments) of Mr. Pierce's eight-year tenure,'' Lantos said.   ``This is a devastating letter, recounting all of DRG's flaws,breaches, non-compliance, irregularities and then concludes, `But wewill lift the requirement that you pre-clear loans,''' he said.   Lantos said he couldn't understand why the department, afterenumerating all of the problems with DRG, dropped a previousrequirement that DRG business be cleared through HUD beforecontinuing.   Mrs. Hills said the ``pre-clearing'' policy was hurting DRG'sbusiness because it was slow and cumbersome and was threatening toput the company out of business.   She said Pierce's letter was ``very tough'' and she advised herclient, ``You are going to have to be more careful than careful''from now on.   Mrs. Hills, who was HUD secretary under President Ford during themid-1970s, said she saw nothing inappropriate in representing DRG asa client after she left office.   ``My dealings with HUD were purely in my capacity as a lawyer,representing clients to the best of my ability on the merits oftheir case,'' she told the subcommittee.   Mrs. Hills returned to government service earlier this year asthe Bush administration's U.S. trade representative.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he doesn't want tosee federal support of housing programs suffer because of theinfluence-peddling and other problems during the Reaganadministration.   The topic is sure to come up Wednesday when the House takes upthe fiscal 1990 spending bill for HUD and other agencies includingthe Department of Veterans Affairs.   Congress has fallen far behind schedule in its consideration ofthe spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Housewas supposed to pass all 13 of them before the July Fourth recess,but only two have cleared so far.   Foley now hopes to pass the rest of them by the August recess.Three are scheduled for this week, with the agriculture and foreignoperations bills slated for action in addition to the HUD bill.   The Senate last week began consideration of a State Departmentauthorization bill.   Among the debates the bill is expected to draw this week arewhether the United States should continue talks with officials ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization who have past links toterrorism, and whether the White House should be barred from usingother countries to carry out deeds that the administration itself isbarred from doing _ such as what happened in the Iran-Contra scandal.   After dealing with foreign affairs, the Senate is expected toturn to the American heartland with a rural development bill. Thelegislation would earmark federal money for loans to ruralbusinesses, upgrading rural water and sewer systems, and provide aidto rural schools and hospitals.   Also, negotiators from the Senate and the House continue effortsto forge a compromise bill to bail out the savings and loan industry.   The House-Senate conference has tentatively agreed to adopt themost stringent features from the separate legislation passed by eachchamber, in hopes of preventing a recurrence of the current troubleswhich are costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.   The two chambers were still wrestling last week with differencesover how to finance the thrift industry bailout and how to structurethe new regulatory system.   How to prevent flag-burning will be discussed as a House panelcontinues hearings on ways to overcome a Supreme Court ruling thatupheld the legality of flag-burning as a form of political protest.Constitutional experts and veterans' groups are scheduled to testifythis week before the constitutional law subcommittee.   The House ethics committee, which took a breather after its probeforced the resignation last month of Speaker Jim Wright, is expectedto meet this week to consider the case of Wright's chief accuser,Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia.   Gingrich, now the No. 2 Republican in the House, is accused ofviolating House rules when he formed a partnership to promote hisbook with people who had an interest in legislation. The ethicscommittee has not yet decided whether to launch a formal inquiryinto the matter.</TEXT></DOC>
