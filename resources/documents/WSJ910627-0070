In the past week, at least six companies have delayedtheir debuts in the stock market. Ambac Corp., aCiticorp-owned unit that insures municipal bonds, postponedits offering on Tuesday. IPL Systems Inc., a Waltham, Mass.,computer products concern, followed suit yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's slowing down substantially . . . becoming moreselective,&quot; says Richard Franyo, head of investment bankingat Alex. Brown andamp; Sons. The Baltimore firm expects tounderwrite about 15 deals in the third quarter, compared withabout 25 in each of the first two quarters, he says.   &quot;You've gone from 190 miles an hour to 100 miles an hour,&quot;says the syndicate manager of one large New York brokeragefirm.   Investment bankers say the delays -- which would-beissuing companies hope won't turn into cancellations -- maybe a sign that the torrid pace of new-stock sales will easeuntil after Labor Day. That's when they figure institutionalinvestors will return from vacation with a renewed appetitefor new stock.   Even so, 1991 already is a record year for equity sales.More than 345 companies, excluding investment funds, haveraised more than $22 billion this year in stock offerings,according to IDD Information Services. About a third of theofferings are initial public offerings (called IPOs in thetrade) and about two thirds are sales of new stock byalready-public companies.   That's $1 billion ahead of the record set in the firsthalf of 1986. Sales for the year may well eclipse the 1986record of $39.2 billion.   But falling stock prices, finicky investors and theprospect of a summer of earnings disappointments is dampingthe market for now.   In the past few weeks, Mr. Franyo of Alex. Brown says, thenumber of offerings completed has been greater than thenumber of new offerings filed -- indicating that the rush tosell stock is slowing.   Some large investors, overwhelmed by the flood ofcompanies trying to sell them stock, are passing on newofferings as they devote more time to monitoring theirexisting shareholdings.   &quot;About two months ago, we decided we were spending so muchtime analyzing IPOs, for so little return, that we shouldpull our horns in and spend a lot more time on the existingportfolio,&quot; says John Laporte, manager of the $1.2 billionNew Horizons Fund of T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.   &quot;We're willing to pass up the quick buck we could make onan IPO, on the theory that we'll probably get another shot atmost of these in three to six months,&quot; adds Mr. Laporte. Henotes that prices of newly issued stocks often rise quickly,but then underperform the market three to six months later.   Even companies aspiring to sell stock have been daunted bythe wash of prospective offerings. Allied Healthcare ProductsInc., a St. Louis maker of medical equipment, last week citedthe overload in the IPO market when it postponed a4.1-million-share initial offering.   &quot;We are disappointed that the current market is floodedwith offerings,&quot; Allied Healthcare said when it announced thedelay. &quot;We've already made a decision to hold on until thefall,&quot; says Sidney Dickstein, a Washington, D.C., attorneyfor the company.   Turmoil among computer-related companies is giving somecompanies reason to think twice before tapping the publicmarket. Micro Linear Corp. a San Jose, Calif., integratedcircuits maker, recently postponed an initial offering of 2.5million shares because of the unsettled state of the marketfor computer-disk drives. Zeos International Ltd., analready-public, computer-related company in St. Paul, Minn.,recently shelved its stock offering because of the drop instock prices among personal computer makers.   Already-public companies, which have dished out generoushelpings of additional shares, also are growing cautious amiduncertain earnings prospects. ICF International, Fairfax,Va., pulled a planned sale of four million Class A shareslast week after announcing that it expects to report profitfor the first quarter ended May 31 below earnings a yearearlier. ICF's stock had been trading at $15 a share when itannounced the offering in mid-May, but plunged to $11 afterthe earnings outlook became clear. Other publicly tradedcompanies, such as SouthTrust Corp., a Birmingham, Ala.,bank, have delayed offerings because their stock prices haveremained flat.   Despite their caution, U.S. corporations still want tosell equity, investment bankers say. If the market recoverssoon, then stock sales could regain their rapid pace. &quot;Summeris traditionally vacation time when {institutions} don't haveto buy deals,&quot; notes one syndicate manager at a large NewYork firm. &quot;But if the market takes off, they'll have tostick around.&quot;   Once the market gets past the traditionally slow summerperiod, companies will have a better idea whether it's stilla great time to issue stock, or whether they missed the bestmoment.
