Glass redox is important to melter and cold cap chemistry:reducing conditions limit glass foaming and devitrification but overlyreducing conditions may cause metallic species to form in the melt whichcould agglomerate and settle to the floor of the melter. Two analytictechniques for glass redox made from the DWPF feed are being investigated:Mossbauer spectroscopy which may be subject to interference from theradiation in actual waste and a rapid and simple dissolution/chemicaltechnique. The wet chemical techniques are also necessary in order tocalibrate the Mossbauer spectra. Determination of Savannah River wasteglass redox by Mossbauer spectroscopy and wet chemical techniques hasbeen examined at Clemson University. The study involves experimentalevaluation of wet chemical techniques, experimental determination ofFe{sup 2+}/Fe{sup 3+} ratios by Mossbauer spectroscopy, and comparisonof the Fe{sup 2+}/Fe{sup 3+} ratios determined by the various techniques.The progress of all three phases is summarized in this report. The detailsof the first phase are given in the attached report. 26 refs., 6 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
