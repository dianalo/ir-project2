Itmarkets computer products, with all the potential pizazz thatimplies. It is highly regarded, offering a wide selection ofparts by mail.   But now, even as Black Box hopes to sell stock to thepublic, the company is buckling under the debt of a leveragedbuy-out orchestrated two years ago by New York's OdysseyPartners and the now-collapsed Drexel Burnham Lambert GroupInc.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a black hole,&quot; says Roger McNamee, manager of T.Rowe Price Associates' Science andamp; Technology Fund, afterstudying disclosure documents for the proposed stockoffering. &quot;Black Box is a great franchise buried in a wholebunch of financial problems. It's hard to blame anybodyexcept Drexel and Odyssey,&quot; a firm widely regarded as a savvyinvestor.   Already in default on one loan, the company originallyplanned a recapitalization to meet an Aug. 31 paymentdeadline by raising $86 million through public offerings ofstock and convertible debt this month. But the plan, callingfor a 45% fully diluted stake to wind up in public hands, waspostponed two weeks ago as the stock market tumbled. Bankerslast week extended the company's grace period to Oct. 15.   Even if market conditions improve, however, the offeringlooks iffy, for prospective investors don't seem to be in anyhurry to bail out a struggling leveraged buy-out. &quot;Theirfinancial reshaping should be handled in the private realm,&quot;says Alan Radlo, manager of the $734 million Fidelity OTCFund.   Black Box's offering document says the company could endup in bankruptcy court if the recapitalization isn'tcompleted within a reasonable period.   Some large investors were strongly advised by Standard andamp;Poor's analyst Mark Basham to avoid the offering, which hadan indicated price range of $12 to $14 a share for 4.5million shares. &quot;This is the dying gasp of a patient on theoperating table,&quot; says Mr. Basham. &quot;I wouldn't find itattractive at any price.&quot;   Mr. McNamee isn't so sure. Tangled up in the &quot;financialmess&quot; created by the LBO, he says, is a high-qualitycataloger and provider of computer equipment. The company hasa loyal following among professionals in charge of computersystems at the nation's largest corporate offices, as well asgovernment and educational complexes.   With 627 employees, Black Box publishes four catalogs ofcomputer products that in the year ended March 31 had a totalcirculation of 4.5 million. It sells its own line ofequipment, including modems, cables, printer interfaces andother computer parts, as well as other manufacturers'products. With subsidiaries in Canada and Britain, it has aninternational distribution network. The company is in theprocess of moving its headquarters from Simi Valley, Calif.,to its main facility in a Pittsburgh suburb.   Black Box's franchise as the nation's leader in directmarketing of computer products &quot;could excite the public,&quot; Mr.McNamee suggests. A shareholder of Black Box's predecessorMicom Systems, Mr. McNamee says his fund &quot;made a ton ofmoney&quot; from that stock until its telecommunications equipmentbusiness slowed in the mid-1980s. Now, he says, the catalogbusiness has developed into a secure and promising business.   However, Mr. McNamee emphasizes that public investorsshouldn't have to undo the debt Black Box incurred two yearsago by &quot;the unrealistic assumptions&quot; of the LBO investors.&quot;It's obvious the original LBO was structurally flawed,&quot; hesays.   Indeed, the $334 million, $16-a-share, buy-out of what wasthen known as Micom Systems was heavily reliant on debt. Aspart of the debt financing, a $138 million revolving creditloan was provided by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Thecompany issued $110 million in senior subordinatedincreasing-rate notes, which carried a rate of 16.19% as ofMarch 31. An additional $34 million came from selling variouspreferred shares.   Despite the sale of three subsidiaries, Black Box owed therevolving credit line $80.5 million as of July 1. It alsoowed the entire $110 million in notes. The company alreadyhas defaulted on the revolving credit; on June 15, it missedan interest payment on the notes.   Annual revenue growth of at least 15% in the past threeyears wasn't enough to offset the debt-service requirements.Black Box's revenue grew to $107 million for fiscal 1990 from$53.2 million four years earlier. However, at the same timeits interest expense jumped to $26.7 million from $134,000.The company reported a loss applicable to common stock of$33.9 million for the year, compared with profit of $5million four years earlier.   Black Box also says it has been hamstrung by the weakeningperformance of Micom Communications Corp., a subsidiary thatmakes low-cost data communications devices. That subsidiarywill be spun off to Odyssey Partners under the plannedrecapitalization.   In addition to the stock offering, the recapitalizationalso calls for a concurrent offering of $35 million ofconvertible debt, the buy-back of most of the notes and newbank financing. Alex. Brown andamp; Sons is the lead underwriter ofthe offering.   A spokesman for Black Box (who also is a spokesman forOdyssey), says the company was confident the IPO would besuccessful before the stock market tumbled in early August.While keeping an eye on the troubled market for signs ofimprovement, Black Box will be looking for alternatives to apublic offering to satisfy the bankers and creditors, hesays. &quot;They're nimble and creative. They'll come up with aresponse.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks tumbled ahead of another weekendof uncertainty about the Middle East.
