(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man with an insatiable appetite forcocaine killed two women with a semiautomatic gun and wounded twodeputies and a hostage before killing himself during 10 hours ofrape and terror, authorities said.   Eugene Thompson Jr., 20, of Littleton, was armed with a MAC-11assault pistol when he broke into a woman's suburban Denver houseearly Thursday and began his crime spree.   The rampage, during which he raped two women, ended in agunbattle at a townhouse as 100 officers searched house-to-house forhim.   Thompson opened fire on the two officers who burst into thetownhouse, hitting one in the chest and neck and the other in theleg, authorities said. He then shot 18-year-old Jake Carper fourtimes in the back, went upstairs and shot himself in the head.   ``A madman, it appears, is what we have,'' said Douglas CountySheriff Steve Zotos. ``We were hoping it wouldn't end this way, butI don't know of any other way it could have ended. There is just noreason to this whole thing.''   Thompson died at a hospital three hours after he shot himself.   Carper, who lives in the townhouse, remained in criticalcondition.   Arapahoe County Deputy Arthur L. Hilton, 37, was in seriouscondition with wounds to the chest. Deputy Daniel Thomas, 36, wasreleased after treatment.   Thompson, a suspect in at least 140 thefts and burglaries, waswanted on arrest warrants that were issued Monday for his failure toappear in Golden District Court for probation revocation,authorities said.   He had been enrolled in a cocaine residence treatment program aspart of his probation for thefts but was kicked out after beingcaught stealing, said Eugene Strauber, regional vice president ofthe Cenikor Foundation cocaine residence treatment program in theDenver suburb of Lakewood.   ``He had an appetite for drugs _ mostly for cocaine _ that hecouldn't keep up with,'' said Lakewood police Detective GeorgeMcGlynn. ``And that's what led to this.''   It wasn't known if Thompson was on drugs during his rampage _ anautopsy was pending. But Douglas County Sheriff's Lt. Bill Walkersaid, ``We know he had been using cocaine heavily in recent weeks.''   The trouble began around 5 a.m. when Thompson broke into47-year-old Beverly Swartz's house in Littleton, authorities said.She called for help, but hung up before she could give her address.Authorities traced the call but when they arrived she and her carwere gone. Her husband, Ralph, summoned from work, arrived at thehouse and was talking with investigators when the telephone rang.   It was his father, Oscar Swartz, calling for help.   Thompson had driven the woman to her in-law's home outsideLittleton, broke in at gunpoint and tied up the three _ Beverly,Oscar and his 68-year-old wife, Janice.   ``He raped the younger woman downstairs, then executed her,''Sheriff Zotos said. ``Then he executed the older one upstairs.''   Thompson then stole a car, and drove about 10 miles to DouglasCounty south of Denver, where he broke into a house, held a man,woman and child at gunpoint and raped the woman, Zotos said.   About 30 minutes after leaving the house, he crashed a stolen carinto a fence and fled, setting off the manhunt.   During their search, police warned schools to lock their doors,and told residents to stay inside. About 25,000 school children werekept in their classes.   ``What do you do if the crazy guy busts in the school? And Idon't know how to answer it. It's a shame it's got to a point in oursociety where we've got to worry about this,'' said Bob Dye, DryCreek Elementary School principal.   Officers tracked Thompson to Littleton, where he broke intoCarper's house and shot him and the officers.   ``All (Carper) said was, `Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! He shot meand then went upstairs and shot himself,''' Arapahoe County SheriffPat Sullivan said.   The MAC-11 is a semiautomatic weapon that can be purchasedover-the-counter. Sullivan said there was evidence the weapon hadbeen modified to be fully automatic. He said the gun fires 32 roundsand only five were left when the gun was finally recovered.   A day before his deputies were wounded, Sullivan lashed out atthe sales of semiautomatic weapons in a nine-page position paper forthe state Legislature.   ``Everything I say in this position paper is true. Our officersare out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed tokill and maim people,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
