Most major retailers had expected sales to rise 5% to 8% from the lackluster 1985 Christmas season. But sales have been soft for reasons including consumer spending on new cars, worries about the economy, and shoppers waiting until the last minute in hopes of reaping big price cuts.    The disappointing sales are being felt by all types of retailers. K mart Corp., the big Troy, Mich.-based discount chain, said it is running below its plan for a 5% to 8% rise in total Christmas sales. The Nashville, Tenn.-based Harveys Department Store chain is generating half the 6% to 7% sales gain it had expected for its stores open more than one year. &quot;What we need is a last-minute rush,&quot; said Greenfield Pitts, vice president and treasurer.    But there was one indication that this season's soft sales would persist rather than turn into a late surge by shoppers, as happened the past two Christmas seasons. For the first time in 13 years, a survey by Leo J. Shapiro andamp; Associates, a Chicago-based consumer-research firm, showed that consumer spending intentions were lower in December than in November.    &quot;The odds of that surge occurring (during the final days of the Christmas season) are poorer than we have ever seen,&quot; said George Rosenbaum, president of the firm.    The rationales for the disappointing sales vary widely among retailers. Many households spent their savings on new cars during the financing wars this fall or were unsettled by news about huge job cuts at General Motors Corp., American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and International Business Machines Corp., retail executives said. Parisian, a Birmingham, Ala.-based apparel store chain, said wet weather has kept many shoppers away. Northern stores said the weather has been too warm to sell heavy clothes.    Some retail analysts are even blaming the drop in President Reagan's public approval rating stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal. &quot;When a president's approval rating falls, there has been a corresponding falloff in consumer spending,&quot; said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist of Management Horizons, the Columbus, Ohio-based retail consulting unit of Price Waterhouse. &quot;A lot of consumer confidence is tied to Reagan himself,&quot; he said.    Based on a survey of retailers, Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, said Christmas sales so far are up about 5% for stores open longer than a year, a pace at the low end of what most retailers had hoped and below what many had expected. &quot;Expectations were too high,&quot; Mr. Barnard said.    The disappointing sales make it difficult for retailers to stick to their plan of avoiding unplanned storewide promotions in the final days of the season. Retailers are trying to break a pattern that began in 1984 when they greatly overestimated the size of the economic recovery and were forced to offer deep storewide price cuts before Christmas. &quot;It's been tough for retailers. Consumers have gotten use to waiting for sales and specials,&quot; said Thomas F. Murasky, K mart's chief financial officer.    For most retailers, the decision whether to devise last-minute sales promotions won't be made until today, after they tabulate the weekend results. Most retailers had planned to run slightly fewer promotions than last year. &quot;Promotional activity was less intense,&quot; said a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. &quot;Our markdowns were all planned.&quot;    Discounts are easy to find. Bullock's Wilshire, an upscale specialty store in Los Angeles, was selling its jewelry at 30% off. &quot;This is unheard of at Bullock's,&quot; said Melody Malmberg, a 29-year-old college administrator shopping in the store. &quot;You can get 30% off a leather jacket.&quot;    Many shoppers are stalling in hopes of getting deeper discounts. &quot;I'm just now starting my shopping,&quot; said Cynthia Merrow, an Inkster, Mich., medical clerk. At the Fairlane Town Center mall in Dearborn, she and other consumers Saturday said they needed incentives to buy. Edna White, a Detroit bank employee, said, &quot;I watch the papers to look for discounts. I didn't watch so much last year.&quot; She added: &quot;With GM laying off people and ATandamp;T, I'm trying to cut down (on spending).&quot;    The stocks of the major retailers have been slipping since the start of December. Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said he expects retailers to post flat fourth-quarter earnings because of a combination of slow Christmas sales and the loss of the investment tax credit. He said he might scale back earnings estimates for retailers if a big sales surge doesn't materialize this week.    Wall Street analysts expect Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. to report disappointing Christmas sales. In a brief statement Friday, however, Sears said its Christmas sales are in line with its plan for moderate growth. Sears had said it expected Saturday to be its biggest sales day of the Christmas season; a spokesman said actual results weren't available.    In New York City, B. Altman andamp; Co. said it will need strong sales this week, which includes one more shopping day than last year, to bring its sales up to expectations. &quot;Sales are soft, not as good as last year so far,&quot; said Jack Schultz, president of the department store chain. &quot;But we hope to do better.&quot;    Some big retailers are generating the results they expected for the five-week season. The Christmas sales of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are &quot;running close to plan,&quot; said Charles Self, vice president of finance. In stores open for at least one year, the big discount chain is getting percentage increases in &quot;the high single digits,&quot; he said.    Wal-Mart, like several other retailers, said its weakest business is in the troubled oil-industry states. &quot;Shoppers are a little more sensitive to the economic times,&quot; said Billy Hines, general manager of the NorthPark Center mall in Dallas. &quot;They have their lists, and they're following them very closely.&quot;    In addition to the war of nerves over discounts, retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department. But retailers have seen strong sales of big-ticket items to well-heeled customers. They are buying to beat the new tax law, which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses.    Retailers were concerned as they entered the Christmas season that the record debt level of U.S. households would depress consumer spending. Some stores reacted by easing credit. The Younkers Department Store chain, Des Moines, Iowa, increased the amount of money available to its credit-card holders and is allowing them to defer payments until March. &quot;We're losing interest on millions of dollars for 90 days,&quot; said Carl Ziltz, vice president of marketing and sales promotion. &quot;We had to do it to be competitive and encourage people to shop in our store.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: International Business Machines Corp.&quot; -- WSJ Dec. 23, 1986) </TEXT></DOC>
