Then a college student, he switched schools and started preparing himself to run the family's apparel manufacturing company.    Today, Mr. Saligman is chairman and chief executive officer of Interco Inc., a $3.34 billion-a-year consumer products conglomerate that bought his family business a dozen years ago. And he isn't sentimental about his roots in the rag trade.    Earlier this year, the 50-year-old Mr. Saligman closed his ancestral firm for failing to meet his stringent financial targets. &quot;He doesn't approach things emotionally,&quot; says Lee M. Liberman, an outside director of St. Louis-based Interco.    Mr. Saligman is taking a similarly cool approach to the hostile takeover threat he now faces. Because Interco already rejected as &quot;inadequate&quot; a $2.47 billion, or $70-a-share, takeover proposal made earlier by a group led by the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C., he doesn't feel pressured to respond swiftly to the group's tender offer of the same amount.    Instead, Mr. Saligman, who declined to be interviewed, has said holders would be better served by the restructuring plan he is pursuing. As part of that plan, he intends to sell Interco's remaining apparel businesses. He is also considering selling Interco's retailing operations to help raise cash for a possible stock buy-back, a big dividend or a management-led buy-out, say people close to the company.    Whether such a restructuring will be broad enough to satisfy Interco holders -- and keep them from tendering their shares to the Rales group -- remains to be seen. But speculators hoping for a higher bid already have pushed the price of Interco's shares above the $70 a share the Rales group offered holders earlier this week. Interco shares closed at $72.875, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    In any case, Mr. Saligman, who is independently wealthy and collects impressionist paintings, is taking his time reviewing all of his options. Today, he is on the road, conducting a regular quarterly financial review at one of Interco's furniture units.    Mr. Saligman's systematic, numbers-oriented approach to managing Interco's 21 far-flung units is one reason the company is now a takeover target. Shortly before becoming chairman in 1985, Mr. Saligman launched a long-term asset redeployment program that would ultimately emphasize furniture and footwear over apparel and retailing.    The first step involved selling Interco's underperforming discount stores and two retailing chains specializing in junior apparel. Through acquisitions, Mr. Saligman added the fast-growing Converse athletic shoe brand to his already successful Florsheim shoe operation, and the Lane furniture label to his Ethan Allen and Broyhill furniture brands. Although Interco owns the valuable London Fog raincoat label, Mr. Saligman decided recently that apparel making didn't hold much promise.    But impatient Wall Street hasn't been impressed. Interco's return on equity has lagged the overall market in recent years, and its stock price languished until last month. &quot;The acquisitions have added to the theoretical value of the company, but they haven't added to shareholder value,&quot; says Harry Mortner, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.    Analysts say Interco's well-known brands make the company worth more in pieces than as a conglomerate. The Rales brothers apparently agree. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, they said they would sell Interco's apparel, retailing and footwear businesses and keep only its furniture operations.    All of this disappoints Mr. Saligman, who has hired the Wall Street firm of Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co. to advise Interco. &quot;We think that Wall Street really hasn't caught up to what's going on here,&quot; says Eugene F. Smith, Interco's senior vice president, finance.    But Mr. Saligman's determination to be his own boss and keep Interco independent runs deep. After the fire that killed his parents and younger sister in their home on Philadelphia's moneyed Main Line, Mr. Saligman &quot;buckled down and became a different person,&quot; says his uncle, Samuel Saligman. &quot;He's still very serious. What he has to do, he does.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
