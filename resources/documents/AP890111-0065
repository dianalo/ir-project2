No pickup.</UNK><DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz saysshort-range U.S. nuclear missiles in West Germany must be modernizeddespite improving East-West relations, a magazine reported today.   Another government official, speaking to The Associated Press onthe condition of anonymity, said he knew Scholz gave the interviewto the Munich-base Bunte magazine but could not confirm it contents.But the official said modernization means ``total replacement'' ofthe Lance nuclear missiles.   The official added that the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationhas made no final decision for the weapons system. In late 1987,U.S. and Soviet officials agreed to scrap all theirintermediate-range nuclear missiles.   In the magazine interview, Scholz was quoted as saying that atotal elimination of short-range missiles was out of the question.   He was quoted as saying he would rather have peace without anyweapons, ``But I am a realist. We need a minimum of nucleardeterrance to be secure against a surprise conventional attack withtanks and aircraft.''   His comments come as the Bonn government struggles to satisfy apopulation that has increasingly warmed to Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev's ideas on arms control.   The United States has been urging West Germany to agree to themodernization of the aging Lance nuclear missiles but has met withpublic resistance and a reluctance of officials in the Bonngovernment to take a firm stand on the issue.   Scholz was quoted as making his comments when he asked ifmodernization of the U.S.-built Lance weapons would be a campaignissue in federal elections next year.   ``You are talking about short-range nuclear weapons. There is noway to indefinitely get around modernization of these weapons,'' hewas quoted by Bunte as saying.   ``A third zero-option in addition to that of the medium- andlonger-range missiles can't be considered,'' Scholz was quoted assaying of the Lance missiles.   The ``zero option'' calls for the elimination of a category ofnuclear missiles on both sides, such as that provided for under theU.S.-Soviet intermediate-range missile treaty treaty signed inDecember 1987.   There are 88 Lance missiles in West Germany, faced off against1,365 modern Soviet-built, short-range missile systems.   The Lance missiles have a range of 75 miles, compared to theSoviet missiles with a range of 180 miles. Modernization of theLance rockets would entail making them faster or even lengtheningtheir range.   A replacement system would probably have a range of 240 miles,still considered short-range, the West German government officialtold the AP.   ``But there would also probably be a lesser number of missiles inthe new system, say 50 or so, if the Soviets also agree to cuttheirs to the same number,'' the official said.   Western officials say that even with Gorbachev's promise inDecember to slash Soviet conventional forces by 500,000 troops and50,000 tanks, the Warsaw Pact will still outnumber North AtlanticTreaty forces by two to one.   A copy of the Bunte interview, which will appear in themagazine's Thursday edition, was provided early to other news media.</TEXT></DOC>
