At least 64 people died nationwide since Thursday, bringing to748 the nationwide death toll from floods that began with themonsoon rains in June, newspapers reported today.   The flood waters swept away children, sank boats, and leveledhouses, newspapers reported. Scores of people died after beingbitten by snakes that had crawled to higher ground, they said.   No deaths were reported in Dhaka, where flood waters ranged fromseveral inches downtown to 6 feet on the outskirts.   Hundreds of thousands of people left their water-logged housesin Dhaka, many moving in with relatives or into government shelters.   Highways and rail lines remained under water, while drinkingwater supplies were cut off in 12 outlying districts of Dhakabecause the pumps were submerged, according to city officials, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   By this morning, the Buriganga River was nearly 3 inches aboveflood stage _ its highest level in 34 years, said the FloodForecast and Warning Center. It predicted the river would riseanother 8 inches by nightfall.   Some low-income city residents have started hoarding food, butthere were few other signs of panic, officials said.   ``There is no shortage of food right now, but the water ismaking transportation virtually impossible,'' President HussainMuhammad Ershad told reporters Thursday.   As the river threatened to engulf the city, the army andvolunteers shored up a dam along the 10-mile road leading fromDhaka to the town of Narayanganj. Students from Dhaka University,which shut down until Sept. 15, joined the relief effort.   At Dhaka airport, foreign airlines were advised to delay flightstoday because a part of the main runway was covered with 1 to 2inches of water, said an airport official. Smaller domestic planesused a short, dry part of the strip to take off and land, said theofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.   There has been little rain in Dhaka in the past week, but theBuriganga rose quickly as flood waters from the north of thecountry surged south.   A ferry with about 700 people aboard sank Wednesday night at thedock in Chandpur, about 40 miles southeast of Dhaka, and fivepeople were missing and feared dead, police in Chandpur said.Salvage workers entered the ferry Friday and found no bodies, thepolice said.   In 1987, more than 1,500 people died in the annual monsoonfloods. In 1985 more than 10,000 were killed when cyclones andtidal waves hit islands in the Bay of Bengal, about 130 miles southof Dhaka.</TEXT></DOC>
