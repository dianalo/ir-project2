Two Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers in theWest Bank city of Ramallah and the Gaza Strip refugee campJabaliya, hospital officials said.   In the Gaza Strip city Khan Yunis, an Israeli civilian fired inthe air after his car was stoned by protesters, an Arab reportersaid.   The army said it was checking both reports. It also said an Arabwas arrested after trying to stab an Israeli soldier in Ramallah,the third such attack in four days.   Leaflets distributed in the occupied territories declared a``Martyrs' Day'' today and called for demonstrations and a strikethis week to protest the visit to Israel by U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz.   Army officials said the five-day Shultz visit, scheduled tobegin Thursday, might prompt an escalation of violence.   ``It's not organized or systematic, but outside events like theShultz visit do affect the situation,'' an army spokeswoman said oncondition of anonymity.   Jerusalem Police spokesman Rafi Levy said 1,500 additionalofficers brought in from other areas had been deployed in the holycity to curb Arab violence.   Israeli troops entered the Arab neighborhood of Silwan at thefoot of the Mount of Olives and cleared away makeshit barricades,while national police went door-to-door checking identificationsand looking for agitators.   Attorney General Yosef Harish sent a letter to Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin saying soldiers may not use force as a means ofpunishment or humiliation, said Justice Ministry spokeswoman EttyEshed.   Orders that call for such use of force are illegal, ruledHarish, who demanded Rabin issue appropriate instructions to thetroops.   Ms. Eshed said Harish decided to take action after manyPalestinians complained to him about abuse by soldiers.   In an army survey, 65 percent of soldiers questioned said theyhad witnessed rough treatment of Palestinians by troops, said thearmy's chief psychologist, Col. Shlomo Dover, on Israel radio.   ``We don't have problems with the motivation of soliders ... notthat they rejoice to do it, but it's an assignment that has beengiven to the army and that's how it is seen by the soldiers,'' hesaid.   Since the wave of protests began Dec. 8 in the territoriesIsrael seized in the 1967 Middle East War, Israelis have killed 61Palestinians. The latest fatalities were two men shot and killed bysoldiers Sunday.   The government has spent $330 million, or 1 percent of thegovernment's 1988 budget, in an attempt to quell the violence.   Palestinians held memorial services Monday to mark Arabs killedby Israeli soldiers.   About 1,500 Arabs marched through Kfar Naama in the West Bank tomourn the loss of the second village to die in the violence thatbegan Dec. 8. Marchers listened to a series of defiant speechescondemning Israel's occupation and renamed one of the roads, TheStreet of the Martyrs of the Uprising.   No soldiers appeared, and no violence was reported.   In another memorial service today, women marched to a cemeteryin the West Bank village of Anabta to honor three residents whodied in clashes with the army earlier this month.   A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car in the West Banktown of Ramallah, but no one was injured, the army said.   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jabaliya, soldiers clashedwith protesters, and a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh,doctors at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said.   In Gaza City, anti-American slogans painted in red on closedstore shutters read: ``No to the Shultz visit. Yes to thePalestinian government. Yes to the PLO.''   The Palestine Liberation Organization has ordered Palestiniansin the West Bank and Gaza Strip not to meet with Shultz, saying heis pro-Israeli and has rejected minimal Palestinian demands.   But local Palestinian leaders said today that they were tryingto persuade PLO chief Yasser Arafat to lift the ban. U.S. officialsmet with several Palestinian representatives over the weekend todiscuss the Shultz visit.   During his visit, Shultz will present to Israeli leaders a U.S.peace initiative calling for an international forum for directtalks on Palestinian self-rule and negotiations on a finalsettlement by December.   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told European Jewish leadersSunday night he objected to the hurried pace: ``Any attempt toforce the pace and shorten the period (of self-rule) would be adetriment to the very essence of the agreement.''   He also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept theAmerican plan: ``When the time comes for decisions, we shall decideon the basis of what is in our national interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
