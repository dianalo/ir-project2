Perry, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said.    In fiscal 1986, which ended June 30, the maker of electronic equipment for cable television and broad-band data-transmission systems had a loss of $2.9 million on revenue of $22.1 million.    &quot;We have gone back to the basics,&quot; Mr. Perry said, alluding to a yearlong effort to increase employee training, boost productivity and sharpen marketing focus. With the operating changes, sales have increased for four consecutive quarters and profit has risen in the past two quarters after four straight quarterly losses.    As a sign of productivity gains, Mr. Perry said monthly shipments have jumped to about $2.6 million from $1.7 million a year earlier, while employment has been cut to 375 workers from 700.    C-Cor sees &quot;healthy increases&quot; in demand for its cable products as deregulation stimulates rebuilding and upgrading of local cable systems, Mr. Perry said. But the data transmission side of C-Cor's business is likely to expand more rapidly.    &quot;We intend to be a $100 million (annual sales) company in three years,&quot; he said. Reaching that goal will require tapping some new markets, such as military contracting. C-Cor's data business would have to grow to about $35 million annually, or 35% of total sales from about 25% now, and the cable business contribution would shrink to about 50% from 65%.    C-Cor recently purchased about 35% of its common stock from the family of its founder, James R. Palmer, and Pennsylvania State University for about $7 million, borrowing about $5 million to complete the transaction. &quot;If we do the job on profits,&quot; Mr. Perry said, &quot;we might make a secondary public offering (of common shares) and pay off our $5 million note.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
