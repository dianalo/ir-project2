<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0152 </DOCNO><TEXT>The crystal structure of U/sub 2/NiC/sub 3/ was determined from single-crystalX-ray data and refined to a residual of R = 0.029 for 530 structure factorsand 34 variable parameters. It is of a new type with orthorhombic symmetry,space group Pnma, a = 6.4145(3) A, b = 3.5457(2) A, c = 13.2315(7) A,V = 300.94 A/sup 3/, and Z = 4 formula units per cell. The two crystallographicallydifferent uranium atoms have large coordination polyhedra formed by allthree constituating components. The nickel atoms have no near nickelneighbour. One third of the Carbon atoms occupies octahedral voids formedby four uranium and two nickel atoms. The other two third form pairs(C-C-distance 1.43 A). One of the carbon atoms of each pair has approximatelyoctahedral coordination with five uranium and one carbon neighbour, theother carbon atom has trigonal prismatic uranium coordination with twonickel and one carbon atom as additional neighbours outside the rectangularfaces of the prism. The hydrolysis of U/sub 2/NiC/sub 3/ in hydrochloricacid yields mainly methane and ethane as well as some ethylene, propeneand propane.</TEXT></DOC>
