LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The top court of the United Methodist Churchgave the go-ahead Wednesday to a four-year, scientific-theologicalinquiry into homosexuality.   The nine-member Judicial Council said the study is intended toprovide ``a base of information to assist the church in resolvingthe difference of opinion within the church regarding theinterpretation of homosexuality in the context of the Christiangospel.''   The go-ahead to the homosexual study, one of the most extensiveever undertaken by a church, came after its legality was questionedunder a church rule barring funds to gay groups or ``to promoteacceptance of homosexuality.''   The church court held that providing for the study clearly was``not in conflict'' with the proscription. No estimate was given ofthe cost of the study authorized at the church's governingconference, held every four years.   Earlier in the conference, the 9.6-million-member denominationstrongly reaffirmed a ban on active homosexuals in the clergy andcondemned such activity.   The Rev. James A. Wall of Chicago, a Methodist and editor of theecumenical weekly Christian Century, said that undertaking thestudy ``leaves our position under a question mark.''   ``The simple fact that the study is being made says there may besomething that was missed by the delegates'' in their actions, hesaid.   In authorizing the study, the conference said ``homosexualityhas proved to be particularly troubling to conscientious Christiansof differing opinions,'' with biblical, theological and scientificquestions about it in dispute.   To try to get the answers, the church directed a study enlistingthe ``best biological, psychological and sociologicalinformation,'' as well as theological and ethical analysis.Scientists and other experts from outside the denomination will beconsulted.   The conference, attended by nearly 1,000 delegates, also calledfor a moratorium on the patenting of animals produced by geneticengineering and authorized a major study of the ethical and otherimplications of such technology.   Meanwhile, a Chinese Protestant leader who addressed theconference said Christianity is growing rapidly in his country andvoiced hope for reconciliation between Chinese Catholics and theVatican.   ``I would say I hope very much and pray very much fornormalization between the Chinese church and the Vatican and forreconciliation between the two sides,'' Bishop K. H. Ting, head ofthe China Christian Council, said at a news conference.   Chinese Catholicism broke ties with the Vatican after Communismcame to power and functions independently as the Catholic PatrioticAssociation. Rome has made numerous recent moves for reconciliationwithout avail.   Ting said there are 8 million Christians in China, about 4million Protestants and 4 million Catholics. He said Protestantsare increasing twice as fast as the population.   However, he discounted Western evangelical reports of 50 to 70million Chinese Christians. ``Conversion to the Christian faith isnot not that easy,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
