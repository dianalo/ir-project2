Roberts back to the United States this month, U.S. militaryofficials disclosed today.   The Mighty Servant 2, a 25,743-ton ``semi-submersible'' cargoship, was escorted into the gulf Tuesday and went to Dubai, wherethe Samuel B. Roberts is in drydock.   The 3,600-ton frigate has been undergoing preliminary repairs inDubai since it struck a mine in the central gulf on April 14. Tenmembers of its crew were injured in the blast.   U.S. officers have credited other crewmen with saving them andthe ship itself after the mine, laid by Iran, blew a 22-foot gashin the hull.   The Navy contracted the Mighty Servant 2 from its owners,Wijsmuller Beheer B.V., of Ijmuiden, Netherlands, to carry thefrigate back to the United States rather than attempt to sail ithome.   Maj. Charles Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command,said no firm date had been set for the Samuel B. Roberts'departure. But military sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the ship would leave the gulf this month.   He said it would be taken to its home port at Newport, R.I. Navyofficials said earlier that the 2-year-old ship would be returnedto the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, where it was built, forfinal repairs.   The Samuel B. Roberts had just completed escorting aU.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker to Kuwait and was saiing back down theGulf when it lumbered over what U.S. offiers say was a freshly-laidminefield 50 miles northeast of Qatar.   The United States retaliated for the mining four days later withattacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the south central gulf.That action began a day of fighting during which six Iranian navalcraft were sunk or disabled.   The Navy escorts followed the U.S. reflagging of Kuwaiti tankersto protect neutral shipping in the gulf, which has been the sceneof spillover violence in the 7-year-old Iran-Iraq war.</TEXT></DOC>
