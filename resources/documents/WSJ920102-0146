The firm would then be free to usecognitive-ability testing procedures that according to acited study would cut productivity loss to 5%. Mr. Carsonsuggests that &quot;the employer can decide to select a certainpercentage of applicants from various groups, and then selectthe highest performers from each group.&quot;   The political rather than managerial conclusion thatquotas provide a compromise between left and right iscompletely erroneous. Quotas embody a wholesale capitulationto the New Left and indeed are not faithful to the spirit oftraditional liberalism. The greatest liberal of our time,Hubert Humphrey, promised us that affirmative-action lawwould never be applied to enforce quotas.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, Mr. Carson's proposal has some disturbingmanagerial implications. The highest performer in a given&quot;minority&quot; group might be a poorer performer than the poorestperformer in the &quot;majority&quot; group or even in another&quot;minority&quot; group. I wonder if Mr. Carson has talked to someof the managers in the high-tech industries in our Phoenixarea or to the managers at the Palo Verde Nuclear GeneratingPlant as to the effects of his proposal?   Finally, he has neglected, completely, the rise inlitigation costs that would probably accompany his proposalif adopted. The assignment of quotas is fraught with legaldifficulty. Hispanics, for example, constitute the highestpercentage of &quot;minority&quot; groups in the Phoenix and Tucsonareas, with the percentage being much higher in the latterarea. Is the quota for Hispanics to be assigned on thepercentage in the local area, the state area, the nationalarea? Or where? In sum, the law might have shot itself in thefoot, but it deserves to be shot in the head, along with Mr.Carson's proposal.   David L. Shapiro   Scottsdale, Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
