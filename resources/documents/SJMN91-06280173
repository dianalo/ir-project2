How would you describe your work?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MICHAEL FEINSTEIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WEST CLOSE-UPS; INTERVIEW  </MEMO><TEXT>     A. I think of myself as being an interpreter of classic American pop songs,from an archival and historical viewpoint. My approach to a classic song isnot clinical -- I take liberties with it, I do my own interpretation -- but myfocus is on approaching it with an understanding of, and respect for, thecomposer's intentions. My concerts differ somewhat from my albums -- inperformance I'm able to do much more in the way of shaping the presentationwith anecdotes and humor.;   Q. Why was the American popular music of thefirst half of the century, especially from the '20s to the '40s, somemorable?;   A. One reason, I think, was the creative atmosphere in New YorkCity in those years. New York bred those guys, those composers. Theyarticulated the diversity and pace in the city that was generated byall theimmigrant groups. Jewish immigrants had gotten into the music publishingbusiness in the late 19th century because the industry was largelyunorganized; they could get into it without facing prejudice. One of thethings the composers did was articulate a desire of the immigrants to be veryAmerican. So you had many very patriotic songs, like Irving Berlin's &quot;GodBless America,&quot; which he wrote in 1917, although he didn't present it to theworld until 1938.;   Q. You've spoken of Irving Berlin as a man who changedthe world.;   A. His songs had immense influence around the world.&quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; was one of the first songs to be an internationalhit. Songs like &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Easter Parade&quot; and so many others --hundreds of them! -- have influenced many, many people and brought themtogether. Berlin was divinely inspired, there's no doubt of that in my mind,but he was also out to write hits. He wrote 1,500 songs, which is juststaggering to me, especially when you realize how good most of them are. IraGershwin, for whom I worked in the late '70s, always said that Berlin'sability with lyrics was exceptional and perhaps underrated -- Ira said thatBerlin would have been considered a great songwriter as a lyricist even ifhe'd never written a tune.;   Q. You're not so enamored of the work of ColePorter?;   A. I don't think I'm as well-matched to Porter as to Berlin or,say, Harold Arlen. There are many Porter songs I love, but there are many Idon't like and find diffi-cult to perform. Bobby Short can do them better thanme. Others too -- Julie Wilson, Steve Ross. I wrote recently in an articlethat maybe they can create a certain archness, a certain reserve, that some ofhis songs require, that I can't generate. A lot of his songs don't hit me inthe kishkas -- &quot;Night and Day&quot; just doesn't do it for me.;   Q. Where are thekishkas?;   A. That's Yiddish for intestines.;   Q. You mentioned HaroldArlen, who wrote the music for the songs in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; You do abeautiful interpretation of &quot;If I Only Had a Brain.&quot;;   A. Thank you. In 1981I heard it sung by E.Y. Harburg, who wrote the lyrics for Arlen's tune, andthis gave me a completely fresh perspective on it -- I began to see the songin the context of the struggle of contemporary man! Our struggle to exist inthe world today, and find love; the simple things we all yearn for. Idiscovered that no one had ever recorded the verses and choruses of all threeof the Oz characters in one piece, so I decided to do it that way. Also, therewere parts cut out of the movie -- there's an introduction to the Scarecrow'spart that goes: &quot;Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole/To a blackbird sitting ona fence. . . .&quot; This is how I often proceed with a song -- going back, diggingaround, seeing what's really there. It's sort of an archeological search.;  Q. When you were growing up in Columbus, Ohio, in the '60s and early '70s, atthe height of the rock era, did any of your peers share your love for the oldtunes?;   A. No. Occasionally some would come over and listen to my records --I had a collection of 78s by Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby and others.I liked some things from the '60s -- Carole King, Leiber andamp; Stoller and others.I like rock 'n' roll more now than I used to. One of my problems with a lot ofcontemporary songs is that, while I really like to bring words to the fore,many records today consist largely of electronic sounds generated in thestudio. Actually, the thing about rock that most worries me is its impact onpeople's hearing. People of my generation are going deaf! It's reallyhappening!  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bob Frost  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911006  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  848  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 6, 199100280173,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
