Chen, best known as an architect of some of the world's fastest computers, has turned general contractor.    Determined to construct within four years a supercomputer at least 100 times faster than anything in existence, Mr. Chen is searching for partners to provide him with &quot;the building blocks&quot; for what would be an astounding machine. As Mr. Chen sees it, the new machine is so vital that besides his balleyhooed partnership with International Business Machines Corp., he plans to seek other partners, including government, commercial users, and very likely more high-technology companies.    Nonetheless, Mr. Chen sees IBM contributing a big portion of the needed materials, including large-scale computer chips, packaging and peripherals.    &quot;If they don't have the building blocks, then I can go elsewhere,&quot; Mr. Chen said yesterday, in his first extensive interview since he startled the computer world by leaving Cray Research Inc. last September.    Mr. Chen didn't exclude anybody from the project, including Minneapolis-based Cray, where he was a senior vice president until the company canceled his developmental work on a similar machine. Although the final agreement with IBM has yet to be worked out, it is understood that the computer giant would have to agree to any new corporate partners.    &quot;The next generation machine needs a team working together,&quot; Mr. Chen said, worrying that &quot;our leadership in this area is slower than you think. We're in danger of losing our momentum. Japan has a much stronger technological base.&quot;    Supercomputing has become one of the world's most visible, competitive technological races, primarily pitting the U.S. against Japan. Mr. Chen said numerous venture capitalists were &quot;waiting in the wings&quot; should his company desire more financing. As for a possible public offering, he said one might be considered after the prototype machine is ready, probably in 1992.    When Cray scrapped Mr. Chen's project last September, its chairman, John A. Rollwagen, said the venture had become too risky and depended on too many technological breakthroughs; &quot;Steve wanted to start with sand and we wanted to start with parts,&quot; was how Mr. Rollwagen put it. But yesterday Mr. Chen said that while his superfast machine would stretch current technology, &quot;we're not talking about sand.&quot;    Mr. Chen was reluctant to discuss his parting from Cray, where he had designed its most popular system, the X-MP, and had done early work on Cray's forthcoming Y-MP machine. But he likened his situation to a battlefield commander who is about ready to attack when his troops are recalled. And he indicated that Cray had been kept well-informed on the progress, and escalating costs, of his aborted effort.    The designer estimates that he lost about a year's time on his new machine because of the break with Cray. &quot;We had just started to build and verify technology,&quot; he said.    The machine Mr. Chen now envisions -- with the working title SS-1 -- would extend the concept of parallel processing, in which several processors attack a single problem simultaneously to expedite its solution. Current supercomputers contain eight processors or less, but Mr. Chen's might contain 64 or more, he said.    And while the speed of supercomputers typically is measured in millions of operations, or computations, per second -- and the SS-1 might be capable of 128 billion a second -- Mr. Chen said such a measure no longer is appropriate.    &quot;We now talk about 'solution time' rather than 'computation time',&quot; he said.    The SS-1 theoretically would allow scientists and engineers to view answers to solutions virtually instantaneously. The machine would give its users &quot;windows&quot; on the computations and allow them to quickly alter the program. Currently, &quot;you don't get the whole picture and you may go down the wrong road a long way,&quot; during the solution of a computer problem, the designer said. Moreover, the machine would be so powerful it could perform three-dimensional modeling. Current computer simulations are one or two-dimensional, Mr. Chen said.    Such a machine would allow engineers to &quot;fly&quot; a theoretical airplane through a simulated wind tunnel in the computer and watch it on a screen as if it actually existed.    Weather forecasting, another likely application, perhaps could be greatly improved, allowing precise forecasts for areas as small as 50 square miles.    Although he is eager to pursue the design of his next supercomputer -- to better explain his concept he jumps up from his desk and works furiously at a whiteboard with a green felt-tipped marker -- Mr. Chen these days is bogged down deciding on a location for his company. Within a month he hopes to choose between Eau Claire, and the Champaign-Urbana, Ill., area near the University of Illinois, where he did graduate work.    Right now his company, Supercomputer Systems Inc., is located in an abandoned printed circuit-board factory on the outskirts of Eau Claire -- and a short drive from his former laboratory at Cray. To help relieve him of other administrative duties and oversee future financing needs, the company today is expected to name Dean W. Nordahl vice president of finance and operations. Mr. Nordahl formerly was with Control Data Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
