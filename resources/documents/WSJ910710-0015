A statement issued by Jay Stephens, the U.S. attorney forthe District of Columbia, said the investigation concernsallegations about the role of Japan Aviation ElectronicsIndustry Ltd., a subsidiary of NEC Corp., in thistransaction. He said the company allegedly manufactured theequipment in Japan &quot;under license from the U.S. government.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   If the equipment was covered by such a license and shippedwithout U.S. permission to an unauthorized destination, theparties involved could be subject to criminal penalties underthe U.S. Arms Export Control Law. The Justice Departmentdidn't specify what kind of military equipment is involved.   Officials of Japan Aviation Electronics admitted last weekthat the company repaired missile parts in Japan for Iranduring its conflict with Iraq, which lasted from September1980 until August 1988. However, Japanese authorities arestill trying to determine who was responsible for the allegedshipments of missile parts, which would be a violation ofJapan's strict ban on weapons exports. NEC, which owns 50.2%of the company, said it had no prior knowledge of theseshipments.   It is unclear at this point which, if any, U.S. company isunder criminal investigation for its involvement with thealleged sale. A spokesman for Litton Industries Inc. saidyesterday that the defense contractor, based in BeverlyHills, Calif., agreed to supply information to the U.S.Customs Service that was related to the case. But he stressedthat Litton itself isn't a target of any inquiry.   Mr. Stephens said his office initiated the investigationjointly with the U.S. Customs Service in 1990. He said theoffice has cooperated with the Japanese investigators and hasreceived some assistance in return.</TEXT></DOC>
