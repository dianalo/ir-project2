The major project objectiveis to develop an economical and technically feasible wood-coal fuel demonstrationprogram for Tennessee's commercial and industrial businesses. The overallprogram will be developed in two phases over a two-year period. Firstyear program objectives include compiling a list of major Tennessee fuelburning installations with wood and/or coal burning facilities, a woodybiomass resources and wood waste directory by county, and air emissionsdata by county or community; identifying the best candidates for switchingto coal-wood fuel mixtures; and reviewing and establishing any statewide incentive program necessary to make a possible fuel switch moreattractive (i.e., emissions offsets, trading, etc.). System installationand demonstration are anticipated for the second program year.</TEXT></DOC>
