L. 99-660).The new law amends both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)(21 U.S.C. 301 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), toauthorize the export from the United States to other countries for commercialmarketing of unapproved new human drugs, unlicensed human biologicals,and unapproved new animal drugs. Under previous law, the export of suchproducts for marketing was confined to those that were approved or licensedby FDA for domestic use.The Drug Export Amendments Act of 1986 establishes three separate tracksfor the export of products. Under each track, an application must be submittedto FDA and FDA approval obtained before export is permitted. The tracksvary considerably in terms of drug eligibility criteria, application requirements,and procedures for review and approval of export applications. The firsttrack applies to applications to export unapproved new human drugs, unlicensedhuman biologicals, and unapproved new animal drugs to any of 21 countrieslisted in the act. (See section 802(b) through (e) of the act (21 U.S.C.382(b) through (e)).) The second track applies to applications to exportsuch unapproved and unlicensed products for use in the prevention or treatmentof tropical diseases. (See section 802(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 382(f)).)The third track applies to applications to export partially processed biologicalproducts for human use. (See section 351(h)(l)(A) of the Public HealthService Act (42 U.S.C. 262(h)(l)(A)).) A notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 2, 1987 (52 FR 10633), listing mailingaddresses for export applications.Subsequently, FDA's Center for Drugs and Biologics was reorganized intotwo separate centers: the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research(CBER), and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This noticeadddresses the application process for exporting unlicensed human biologicalproducts under the Drug Export Amendments Act of 1986.Applications to export unlicensed human biological products (includingpartially processed biological products) should be mailed to Boyd Fogle,Jr. (address above), or delivered in person between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,Monday through Friday, to Boyd Fogle, Jr., Center for Biologics Evaluationand Research, Rm. 217, 7520 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.FDA is considering developing a comprehensive written guidance on the proceduresto be followed in submitting export applications and on the content andformat of such applications. Pending issuance of this guidance, questionsabout the content and format of export applications for biological productsshould be directed to Boyd Fogle, Jr.This notice supplants the notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 2, 1987 (52 FR 10633), insofar as itapplied to unlicensed human biological products.
