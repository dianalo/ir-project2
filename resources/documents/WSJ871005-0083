Betting against conventional wisdom has been exceptionally profitable this year. Few bond traders expected the extraordinary surge in interest rates that began last March, and now a small group of contrarian money managers suspects investors are so pessimistic that bond prices are likely to rebound.    &quot;When things look the worst, it's time to buy,&quot; says Roland M. Machold, director of New Jersey's investment division, which manages about $20 billion. &quot;The downside risk isn't that great from here on in.&quot; Wayne D. Lyski, senior vice president at Alliance Capital Management Corp., agrees. &quot;The risk is being out of the market, not in it,&quot; he says.    These views, though, still represent a minority. In several recent surveys, many analysts predicted higher inflation will lead to even higher interest rates in coming months. &quot;I do think U.S. interest rates will rise over the next six to 12 months,&quot; says Sir Kit McMahon, chairman of Midland Bank and former deputy governor of the Bank of England. &quot;Very few Americans yet understand the significance of the fact that they are a debtor nation.&quot;    Despite a rally last Friday afternoon, prices of long-term Treasury bonds are close to their lowest levels this year. Through Sept. 30, the bond market turned in its worst performance for any nine-month period ever, according to Ryan Financial Strategy Group. The latest 30-year Treasury issue now yields about 9.7%, not far below the 9.82% peak reached last Tuesday.    Greta E. Marshall, investment manager of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages more than $43 billion, thinks bonds are beginning to look attractive once again. &quot;I think this may be the time to look for a turnaround in the bond market,&quot; she said in an interview on The Wall Street Journal Report, a weekly television program, broadcast last weekend.    The bond market's deep slump this year probably is a &quot;correction&quot; in a bull market, Ms. Marshall says. &quot;I think we're in a long-term decline in the level of interest rates.&quot; One reason: &quot;The demographic factors -- the fact that we have an aging population,&quot; which she said augurs well for a higher savings rate and thus lower interest rates.    The huge California system plans to &quot;gradually start to lengthen our bond portfolio,&quot; Ms. Marshall said. &quot;We may have a little bit better buying opportunity a few months or a year into the future, but I'm more inclined to look positively on the long-term fixed-income market now than I have been in the last six months or so.&quot;    New Jersey began buying long-term Treasury bonds last June, when yields stood at around 9%. Since then, the state has bought more than $170 million of 30-year government bonds. &quot;Obviously, these bonds are now trading at a discount to what we paid for them,&quot; says Mr. Machold. Nevertheless, he emphasizes that &quot;ours isn't a short-term bet on rates,&quot; adding that buying short-term money market instruments would be &quot;one of the worst things we could do at this point.&quot;    In fact, the New Jersey Investment Division, which includes primarily the state employees' pension fund, regards the surge in bond yields as an opportunity to better offset its future payments.    &quot;If rates went to 11 1/2%, we'd buy another $100 million,&quot; Mr. Machold says. &quot;If we see 12% yields on long-term governments, we'll have market losses on our books, but we'll wait it out. I don't think we'll have 13% to 15% bond yields like we saw in the early 1980s.&quot;    Even on Wall Street, where bond market bearishness is especially rampant, there are a few born-again bulls. At Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., &quot;We now are recommending that investors accumulate bonds on weakness,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, the firm's chief economist, in what he described as a &quot;a major shift in our thinking.&quot;    &quot;My view is Baker's support of a gold/commodity-backed dollar is a significant step for sounder money and moderate long-term inflation,&quot; he said, referring to a speech last week by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Mr. Baker suggested that economic planning be based partly on &quot;a basket of commodities,&quot; including gold.    In Mr. Kudlow's opinion, Mr. Baker's speech &quot;has very positive implications for bonds&quot; because it represents &quot;a reversal&quot; of Mr. Baker's &quot;earlier plan for a cheaper dollar and reflation.&quot;    Mr. Kudlow, a former chief economist at the White House Office of Management and Budget, said he expects Mr. Baker's proposal to be implemented by the Federal Reserve. Even though interest rates may rise further during this year's fourth quarter, he adds: &quot;I believe that a commodity-backed dollar means only 3%-4% inflation over the long run, which translates into 7% or 8% yields&quot; on 30-year Treasury bonds.    But many analysts dismiss such speculation as excessive optimism. &quot;They are trying to wave a wand,&quot; says Nicholas Sargen, a vice president in the bond market research department at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;It would be a great coup for the administration if in one speech they could buy out all the gold bugs.    &quot;Actually, all Mr. Baker suggested is that another economic variable be added&quot; to the already lengthy list of gauges used by the seven leading industrial nations to set broad economic policy and exchangerate ranges, Mr. Sargen says. &quot;We may have some trading rallies (in the bond market), but the days of a bull market globally are over.&quot;    &quot;A lot of this gloom and doom seems to be overdone,&quot; says Deborah Allen Olivier, president of the Claremont Economics Institute in Claremont, Calif. &quot;We think bonds are a good buy -- but not for the weak-kneed investor. The bond market is going to remain very volatile.&quot;    Even some of the bulls are cautious. Alliance Capital's Mr. Lyski, who manages $1.7 billion, says, &quot;The only thing that I feel should be happening that isn't happening is a flatter yield curve.&quot; A flatter yield curve would mean that the gap between short-term and long-term rates would narrow significantly. For instance, he says, the current spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes, now just over one percentage point, &quot;should be narrowing by about a quarter of a percentage point.&quot;    If that happens, &quot;I'll feel on the right track because it would support the view that the economy is slowing,&quot; Mr. Lyski says. Nevertheless, Mr. Lyski, who predicts a major bond rally beginning at the end of 1987, is hedging his bets by keeping his bond purchases limited to five-year to seven-year maturities.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Bond prices rallied after an initial sell-off, with some actively traded 30-year government issues climbing more than 3/4 point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Early in the day, the credit markets were buffeted by a Labor Department report showing further strength in the economy, as the civilian unemployment rate in September fell to 5.9% from 6% in August, bringing it to its lowest level since November 1979, when it also was 5.9%.    A strengthening dollar and reports that some undisclosed institutions snapped up large blocks of government bonds helped trigger a price rebound that left the bond market little changed from the previous week.    The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 rose to a price of 92 2/32 from 91 1/4 Thursday, as the yield fell to 9.69% from 9.78%. Early in the day, the benchmark government issue traded as low as 90 1/2. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 9.83 points to 1179.21. The high was 1181.28, and the low was 1160.55.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 rose to 93 30/32 from 93 17/32 as the yield fell to 9.59% from 9.65%. Traders said the Treasury's new four-year notes to be auctioned tomorrow were quoted in when-issued trading at a yield of 9.08%, while the seven-year notes to be auctioned Wednesday were quoted at 9.45%.    Despite the bond market's rally, many economists said the outlook remains gloomy. &quot;We can expect interest rates to rise one to 1 1/2 percentage points over the next 12 months,&quot; said Norman Robertson, a senior vice president at Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh. &quot;The latest unemployment and other economic data suggest we are very close to full employment, a situation that invariably pushes up prices and interest rates.&quot;    Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., forecasts &quot;a protracted period of rates remaining at current levels or ratcheting irregularly upward.&quot;    Among short-term interest rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate fell slightly to 6.67% bid from 6.68% bid Thursday. The latest six-month bill rate was unchanged at 6.84% bid.    The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7.41%, down from 7.71% Thursday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
