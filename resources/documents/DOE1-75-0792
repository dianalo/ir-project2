Results for electron densitiesderived from the I(208.71 A)/I(200.95 A), I(181.90 A)/I(200.95 A), andI(215.37 A)/I(200.95 A) values for solar flares obtained by the SkylabNRL S082A slitless spectrograph are in excellant agreement. Ca XV electrondensities are found to compare favorably with those determined from theline ratios of ions formed at similar electron temperatures. The resultsprovide support for the accuracy of the adopted atomic data and for theline ratio calculation method. 27 references.</TEXT></DOC>
