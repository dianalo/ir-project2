SolomonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RETAILING (RET) </IN><TEXT>   A supervisor at a big retailer devised what he considered a foolproof plan for ripping off his employer: He bought a cash register, placed it among three others in the store -- and kept each day's proceeds.    His take reached a total of more than $10,000, but the scam was undone when an alert co-worker noticed it and phoned an employee-theft hotline to report it.    U.S. retailers are stepping up efforts to fight employee theft, through familiar techniques like hotlines, heftier rewards for tips and innovative methods including computer sleuthing and more worker-training sessions.    Their concern is understandable. One Justice Department study estimates that employee theft accounts for almost 70% of retailers' losses to all kinds of crime -- which amounted to $11.77 billion in 1980, the last year for which the agency has made an estimate. Other studies suggest that three in four retail employees know at least one colleague who is stealing.    Many specialists say drug use and weakening morality are major causes of employee theft. The problem has worsened in the past decade as Sunday hours and later store closings have attracted a younger work force, one less committed to the retail trade, says Richard C. Hollinger, a University of Florida sociologist who surveyed over 9,000 retail workers in a 1980 study of business crime. At the same time, many stores have gone to leaner staffs, which mean fewer watchdogs.    But the stores are fighting back. In New York, Bloomingdale's awards employees $2,500 (suburban Bloomingdale's stores offer $1,250) for snitching on a thieving co-worker. Alexander's Inc., a New York-based discount department-store chain, not only doubled its reward last fall to $1,000, but also began offering each whistle blower a year of chances in a twice-weekly New York state lottery game.    &quot;I wanted something with impact, and this has impact,&quot; says Edwin T. Dreher, vice president of corporate security.    Workers receive the full cash prize and lottery chances regardless of the value of goods or amount of cash recovered from an apprehended worker. One Alexander's employee recently received the reward after his tip led to the apprehension of a fellow worker. The booty: A slice of pie from the cafeteria. Another tip led to the recovery of nearly $2,000 of electronic equipment that a worker had spirited out of an Alexander's store. Mr. Dreher says the number of awards has nearly doubled since the new program took effect.    New strategies are also working at Marshall Field's andamp; Co., the Chicago-based retailer that employs 14,000. Since late 1985, when the firm doubled to $500 its reward for reporting worker pilferage, the number of rewards has jumped about 70%. Last year, Marshall Field's security personnel caught nearly 500 dishonest employees and gave out about 170 rewards to &quot;everyone from stockboys to top management&quot; for reporting suspicious co-worker activity, says Lewis C. Shealy, vice president of loss prevention.    While some security administrators praise the bounty strategy, others fear it may create an unhealthy work environment. J.C. Penney Co., for one, won't pay workers to snitch.    &quot;We want employees to pay attention to selling -- not have them watching each other or wondering if someone's looking over their shoulder,&quot; says Loren D. Sullivan, manager of corporate loss prevention for the company's 1,800 stores. He and some other industry officials say tips come in even without cash incentives.    While virtually all reward programs offer anonymity, retail consultants say only about one of every seven employees who know of a theft will snitch on a fellow worker. Distrust of management and lack of company loyalty are among the reasons, says Joseph T. Wells, chairman of the Institute for Financial Crime Prevention.    &quot;Fear of reprisal from the apprehended worker is only a small part&quot; of their reluctance, says Mr. Wells, whose Austin, Texas-based firm provides education and research on white-collar crime. &quot;Most employees are honest, and will tell on those few bad apples -- providing they're educated on the problem and feel that management will act in their best interest.&quot;    Saks Fifth Avenue, for one, says it now discusses this once-taboo subject with employees. Early this year, the New York-based chain began showing its 8,000 employees a series of videos on employee theft prepared by Arthur Young andamp; Co., a management-consulting firm in New York. Round-table discussions follow brief vignettes shown to a handful of workers.    After a recent screening at Saks's Pittsburgh store, employees spoke freely on the company's vulnerabilities and agreed emphatically that management should prosecute workers caught stealing.    &quot;We used to say (to workers), If you're stealing, you're going to get caught,'&quot; recalls Jack L. Hayes, a former retail security executive who owns a loss-prevention consulting firm and wrote the script for the video. &quot;Now, we're reaching out and saying, 'Help us stop employee theft.'&quot;    Retailers in Chicago, Washington and other big cities now screen job seekers through private companies that compile data from participating merchants on retail workers caught stealing and other individuals caught shoplifting.    Stores Mutual Association of Illinois Inc., a Chicago-based clearinghouse founded in October 1985, has over 50,000 names of shoplifters, dishonest employees and credit-card impostors. Marshall Field's says it has weeded out about 70 employee applicants through the service.    Despite these preventive steps, security personnel still rely heavily on apprehension techniques, which now include sophisticated methods of computer sleuthing.    Marshall Field's, through sales terminals, can tally a clerk's cash sales, refunds and voided sales checks. Too many refunds could indicate fraudulent transactions, with the money going to the clerk or friends. Excessive voids or too few cash sales could mean a clerk pocketing money from legitimate transactions.    The chain's security personnel can more easily spot &quot;sweethearting&quot; -- where employees include extra items with friends' and relatives' purchases. Backroom computers now show loss-prevention workers what items a clerk rings up while closed-circuit television shows what goes into a customer's bag.    Such efforts have helped Marshall Field's reduce its yearly inventory losses to 2.1% of sales in 1986 from 3.3% in 1983, says Paul B. Cogswell, its loss-prevention director. Still, he maintains, the best way to curtail losses &quot;is in educating the honest employee -- and keeping him that way.&quot;    ---                  Where Thefts Occur   A survey of 113 retail companies found their employeethefts occurred at: Point of sale ............................ 39% Sales floor .............................. 17% Stock area ............................... 16% Receiving area ........................... 10% Warehouse ................................ 10% Trash ..................................... 5% Other ..................................... 3%   Source: Arthur Young andamp;Co.</TEXT></DOC>
