Aneffective answer may be task-switching programs, which let you switch amongapplications at the touch of a key by holding programs in suspended animationwhile you work with one at a time.andP;  It's the look of multitasking without thebackground processing power or cutting and pasting between applications.andM;You might wonder why anyone would consider these more-limited task-switchingpackages, especially since multitasking environments like Windows 3.0 can, ofcourse, be used as task switchers.andP;  There are three situations in which atask switcher may be the preferred choice, and all stem from the fact that amultitasking environment places more demands on the computer's resources thana task switcher does.andM;First, if you have an older, slower computer, the performance penalty forrunning tasks in the background may simply be intolerable.andP;  Even if you-canmake good use of background operation-running a database sort while writing areport in the foreground, for example-you may decide that the trade-off isn'tworth it.andM;At the other extreme, you may have the newest hardware with a super-fast harddisk and a 486 processor, but if you don't need the background processingcapabilities of programs like DESQview 386 or VM/386, you may not want tothrow away processing power on multitasking environments that you aren'tusing.andM;A final way that you can take advantage of the relatively humble talents oftask switchers is to use them as management systems for unrulyterminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) packages.andP;  Notorious for gobbling up memoryand tripping up applications, TSRs are tamed when you put each one in its ownpartition and swap it out of memory when it's not in use.andP;  The TSR is stilljust one keystroke away, but when it's out of sight, it's out of mind,literally.andP;  Your main application gets all the RAM it needs.andM;A USEFUL COMPROMISEandM;In all these situations, a task-switching package is a useful compromisebecause it will let you switch among programs in a single keystroke withoutcosting you a performance penalty.andP;  Although specifics vary among individualprograms, a task switcher will take a snapshot of the currently runningprogram, data, and screen image, store it in memory, and then bring up thenext application.andP;  When switching back to the first program, it reloads thesnapshot that it previously stored.andP;  For greatest speed, task switchers willswap programs to and from extended or expanded memory and will use your harddisk only when memory is full.andP;  But even on a 4.77-MHz XT with nothing but ahard disk for swapping, a task switcher is still faster than exiting oneprogram, loading the next, exiting it, and reloading the first.andM;Not so incidentally, if you've become used to a multitasking environment onyour desktop system, a task-switching package is the perfect compromise foryour less-powerful portable.andP;  You can also combine task switching andmultitasking.andP;  For example, it's possible to load a task switcher in oneDESQview task window and run a database sort as a background task at the sametime.andP;  Performance in the task switcher window will slow you down somewhat,but having only two windows open in DESQview won't slow you down nearly asmuch as if you had each program in its own window.andM;TWO WAYS TO SWAPandM;AutoSwap and Dr. Switch are really task chainers that build on the &quot;Go toDOS&quot; command in most programs.andP;  When you shell out to DOS, the task chainerwill swap the first program out of memory to leave room for the next.andP;  But toget back to the first program, you have to leave the second by way of DOS.andO;You can create a chain of programs this way, shelling out to DOS at eachstep.andP;  The task chaining approach is limited, yet has the advantage ofsimplicity.andP;  Since you can move only backward or forward, you don't have therandom access you have with a task switcher, which swaps out to memory everytime.andM;The other packages that are reviewed here-Back andamp; Forth, HeadRoom, SoftwareCarousel, and Switch-It-are all true task switchers.andP;  All let you definemultiple partitions and switch among them at will.andP;  A new version of Dr.andO;Switch, which was unavailable for this review, will be a complete taskswitcher, but Black and White International expects to continue selling thetask-chaining version as well.andM;Whether you spend half your day exiting one application and loading upanother or are just tired of continuously battling with your TSR collection,task-switching packages are a simple, inexpensive way to smooth out the roughedges of your computing routine.andM;Software CarouselandM;The clear editor's choice among task switchers is Software Carousel.andO;Software Carousel makes no  attempt to do anything fancy when handling TSRslike HeadRoom and doesn't offer a slick installation program to challengeSwitch-It's.andP;  It also doesn't offer many partitions  (12 are available).andO;However, in  our tests, it was the most stable task switcher of the group, and all the clever features in the  world don't matter if the basic functionsdon't work.andM;An honorable mention is earned by Back andamp; Forth, which came  in a close secondfor stability and for the amount of memory it leaves for applicationprograms.andP;  Back andamp; Forth is a relatively new program that still has too manyrough edges, but the promise of frequent revisions, plus the invitation totry before you buy (it's a shareware package) make it well worth yourconsideration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
