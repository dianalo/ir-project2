<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0740 </DOCNO><TEXT>The stemming device has application for any explosive loaded blast hole.The primary market areas are coal mining, hard rock mining, and construction.An average of 7.6 million boreholes are drilled annually with 41{percent}in coal mining, 23{percent} in quarry operations, 21{percent} in construction,and 15{percent} in metal mining. There are no other stemming deviceson the market. The current practice is to drill the hole, fill the holewith explosives, and stem the explosives by packing the rock cuttingson top of the explosive column. This conventional stemming material wouldalso be used in conjunction with the stemming device. Thus, the stemmingdevice is competing with a practice that has no material cost, i.e.,the waste material from the drilling process. Therefore, the cost ofthe stemming device must be offset by an overall reduction in blastingcost through reduction in the number of holes drilled, related reductionin drilling labor costs, and improved fragmentation (reduction in secondaryand tertiary crushing costs). In addition, the stemming device reducesthe blasting noise which is a consideration in populated areas. The customermust be shown the net savings from using the stemming device. The stemmingdevice is easily copied and manufactured and thus is expected to attractcompetition if it is successful. The strategy will be to establish thestemming device as the dominant force in the market supported by expertisein blasting applications, while reducing device manufacturing/materialcosts to the minimum.</TEXT></DOC>
