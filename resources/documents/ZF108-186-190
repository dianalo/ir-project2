 Politics has a bad name.andP;  If you ran acontest for the worst example -- or do I mean the best example? -- therewould be one clear-cut winner -- the principles of political conduct thatNiccolo Machiavelli laid down in his book, The Prince, back in 1513.andM;Machiavelli considered politics amoral and believed that any means ofachieving political power, however unscrupulous, could be justified.andP;  Hencethe word Machiavellian has come to signify cunning, duplicity and bad faith.andM;Machiavellian politics is not a thing of the past.andP;  But the informationresources management executive cannot ignore politics nor dismiss it asunsavory.andM;The GSA report,  The Senior Federal IRM Manager: Major Roles andResponsibilities as We Move Into the 1990s, describes the successful manageras &quot;politically astute and capable of dealing with the dynamic politicalenvironment of an agency.&quot;andM;All well and good, but the report gives us precious little idea of what itmeans to be &quot;politically astute&quot; and how one might go about developing thisuseful quality.andM;Taming of the ShrewdandM;Machiavelli, however, tackled just those questions for Lorenzo de Medici.andO;Machiavelli's interest was not political theory but the pragmatic rules ofpower politics.andP;  Machiavelli's notion of realistic politics is carried overto modern life when we refer to someone as being &quot;politically shrewd.&quot;andP;  Bythat we mean the person is practical, hardheaded and clever in makingpolitical judgments, but not necessarily amoral.andM;Being politically astute is more than being shrewd.andP;  It suggests politicalsensitivity and the capacity to see through and to understand what is hiddenand puzzling about the political scene.andP;  And it also suggests the ability toemploy tact and conciliation, a pair of complementary diplomatic skills, inhandling stressful political situations.andM;Many of us are surprised when we are told that we have been practicingpolitics all our lives.andP;  If you doubt this, you don't remember telling yourparents that something you wanted them to buy for you would help you out inschool.andM;What does that have to do with politics?andP;  Politics is concerned with humanassociations and the ends attainable through those associations.andP;  In thissimple example, the relationship is between parents and their child.andP;  Thechild carries out a political act by suggesting that a purchase will satisfyan aim of the parents, although the child's purpose, though not in conflict,is clearly different.andM;Who hasn't uttered those immortal words, &quot;But it will help me out in school&quot;?andO;Aristotle was right when he said &quot;...Main is by nature a political animal.&quot;andM;Let's take a look at an example of politics at work in IRM.andP;  Another GSAreport, Critical Success Factors for Systems Modernization, identifies&quot;strong, sustained and visible support of senior management&quot; as a criticalsuccess factor.andP;  The report says:andM;&quot;Senior management must set the general direction for the program, mobilizerequired resources, neutralize parochial interests of existing organizationalunits and manage the political environment and budget process.andP;  Of particularimportance, senior management must establish systems modernization as a highpriority of the agency and overcome skepticism about the value and likelysuccess of such projects.&quot;andM;New Order of ThingsandM;Machiavelli would have agreed.andP;  In his own words, &quot;There is nothing moredifficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in itssuccess, than to take a lead in the introduction of a new order of things.&quot;andM;Sounds like a good description of a systems modernization project to me.andM;Machiavelli went on to say, &quot;Where the willingness is great, the difficultiescannot be great.&quot;andM;That's why, as noted above, top management's involvement is necessary.andM;How does the politically astute senior IRM manager get top managementinvolved?andP;  Ted Klein, president of the Boston Systems Group, has put togethera list of what he thinks an IRM manager must do to gain managementinvolvement.andP;  What I like about the list is that it has the ring of reality.andM;* You must fit into the top management culture and environment.andM;* Eschew all idealizations with the technology.andM;* Be ready to manage expectations.andM;* Always give costs or alternatives.andM;* Never say no.andM;* The user interface is critical.andM;* Look for value, not benefits.andM;* Don't be afraid to say &quot;I don't know.&quot;andP;  And, &quot;But I will find out.&quot;andM;* Deliver what you promise -- just don't promise a lot.andM;* If you don't have an initial commitment, forget it!andM;Nothing about this list of maxims is Machiavellian.andP;  They are just a matterof practical IRM politics.andP;  But they deal with only one narrow politicalissue in IRM, so the question remains, &quot;How does a senior IRM manager becomepolitically astute?&quot;andM;The answer?andP;  With difficulty.andP;  But here are some suggestions on how to start.andM;It is best to begin with a reasonably clear notion of what politics is allabout.andM;For my part I have found it most helpful to think of politics, primarily, asconcern for how the associations in a community affect the achievement ofspecific goals.andP;  And then, secondarily, as concern for the competitionbetween differing interest groups in that community for power and leadership.andM;With this as a beginning, some practical applications should readily occur tothe IRM manager.andM;If you think some books would help, I would suggest first reading Aristotle'sPolitics to get the basics.andP;  It is an interesting amalgam of history,psychology, economics and management that sets the stage for practicalpolitics.andP;  It will give you a feel for how political theory developed fromobserved human behavior.andM;Other ReadingsandM;Then read any of the many contemporary books on the subjects of managing forexcellence and the Japanese style of management.andP;  In them you will find awide ranging set of practical examples of politics at work, although they arenot usually identified as such.andM;Good politicians -- perhaps that's an oxymoron -- recognize that both theformal and the informal, unstructured relationships in a community caninfluence how goals are achieved.andP;  Such politicians consciously strive tomodify those relationships to support their aims.andP;  Manipulate is the verbsome would use, but that has an unnecessarily negative connotation.andM;For example, a source of constant amazement to me is that some people arejust now discovering organizational structure as a way to create humaninteractions that will advance, or retard, the attainment of organizationalgoals, as well as a way of organizing work to achieve efficiency.andM;Politics has a bad name.andP;  It shouldn't.andP;  And if more people with goodintentions would practice it well, it wouldn't.andM;Frank Carr retired from the General Services Administration in 1988.andP;  Ascommissioner of GSA's Information Resources Management Service, he was thefederal government's top information technology procurement official.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
