<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-1057 </DOCNO><TEXT>A group of 35 wind turbines on the Castello Ranch in Altamont Pass, California,was investigated to quantify array wake effects (losses in energy productiondue to operation of upwind turbines) and the factors influencing them.Approximately 65 hours of field measurements were made in summer 1986,with turbine energy production and wind velocity data recorded for variousscenarios of array operation. Customized software and hardware were developedand installed by Fayette to facilitate these measurements. The existenceof wake effects was fairly well established. Relative energy-productionlosses averaged 6% at the second row, when the first row was operating,and 7 to 8% at the third row, when the first two were operating. Apparently,then, the impact of the first row on the third (at a 21-rotor-diameterdistance) was minimal. Ambient wind speed did not appear to affect therelative wind speed pattern within the array due to wakes, but becauseof the shape of the performance curve, it did affect relative energyproduction losses (particularly for the low-RPM mode of machine operation).The influences of ambient atmospheric conditions, such as stability,turbulence, and shear on the array wakes, were also investigated by testingover a range of the conditions available during a typical 24-hour dayat the test site. None of these variables showed any significant effecton the degree of wake-induced energy losses. While the results of thisstudy apply only to this specific array and type of wind turbine, themethodology could be applied to study wake effects at other wind farms.6 refs., 7 figs., 20 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
