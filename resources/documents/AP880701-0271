China, faced with a motherlode of maternity, marked the occasionwith a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keeppracticing birth control. In Tokyo, a group of experts gathered todebate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effectson the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people.   Takashi Sato, Japan's minister of agriculture, said ``excessivepopulation growth will result in shortages of food, resources andenergy ... and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries.   ``Without global-level responses to the issues of population,food, environment and development, it would be difficult for theworld to welcome a peaceful 21st century,'' said Sato, chairman ofthe Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development,which sponsored the conference.   In July 1987, the world's population passed 5 billion, doublethe population in 1950.   According to United Nations estimates, Asia's population willreach 3 billion at 47 minutes after midnight Greenwich Mean Time onAug. 10 (8:47 p.m. EDT Aug. 9). Asian experts, however, predict themilestone will be reached within days.   Professor Gayl D. Ness of the University of Michigan estimatedthat Asia's population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of thecentury and to 4.5 billion by 2025, while the world populationreaches 8.2 billion.   Rice production will have to increase 50 percent by 2025 to feedthe continent, Ness said, but great gains already have beenregistered by farmers in China, Japan and Southeast Asia.   The 21st century targets ``are well within the realm ofpossibility if the agricultural transformation continues. This, ofcourse, requires sensitive government policies,'' said thesociologist and researcher on Asian population.   Asia has made ``substantial progress'' in lowering fertilityrates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies tolimit population growth, he said.   But Ness noted disparities in different regions of Asia. EastAsian countries such as China and Japan, which has 122 millionpeople, have rapidly declining fertility rates.   But in South Asia, India is still experiencing 2.08 percentannual growth in its population of 818 million; Pakistan has 3.45percent growth with 115 million people; and Bangladesh has 2.67percent growth rate from a current base of 110 million, accordingto U.N. figures.   ``The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographictransition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in thedeath rates,'' Ness said.   He and other panelists were critical of the United States forwithdrawing money from the U.N. Fund for Population Activitiesbecause of the fund's support for abortion.   The population growth also has caused some social changes.   Professor Toshio Kuroda, director emeritus of Tokyo's Instituteof Population at Nihon University, noted that China ``expects thefamily to care for the aged ... but the family is undergoingtremendous change in China with the one-child family.''   China, the world's most populous country with 1.08 billionpeople, has since the early 1980s limited most families to onechild. But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years.   In Beijing, Chinese officials marked the Day of 3 Billion InAsia with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People.   They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers,doctors and others for ``outstanding performance in implementingour population policy.''   Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat toeconomic development.   ``We cannot think that we can have more children because ofeconomic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because ofprogress in family planning,'' said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman.</TEXT></DOC>
