L.No. 99-80. 51 FR 16659 (May 6, 1986). The EAJA allows financially eligiblelitigants who prevail against the federal government in civil actions andadministrative proceedings to recover attorney fees and other expenses,unless the government can show that its position was substantially justifiedor that special circumstances exist that would make an award unjust. Amongother things, the 1985 amendments removed ``sunset'' provisions from theEAJA as originally enacted in 1980, broadened the class of litigants financiallyeligible to seek EAJA awards, and clarified several interpretive points.Financial eligibility formerly was limited to individuals with a net worthof $1 million or less and to certain organizations with a net worth of$5 million or less. The figures are now $2 million and $7 million respectively.The Commission is proposing to revise its rules implementing the EAJA,17 CFR 201.31 <T3>et seq., </T3>to implement the 1985 statute. The Commission's staffhas studied the revised Model Rules adopted by ACUS and has consulted withACUS concerning possible amendments to the Commission's EAJA rules.For the most part, the Commission is proposing to depart from the 1986Model Rules only where the Commission's existing EAJA rules already differedfrom the 1981 Model Rules or where the 1986 Model Rule revisions are inapplicableto Commission proceedings or otherwise unnecessary. For example, the proposedCommission rules omit references to contract appeal proceedings, sincethe Commission does not adjudicate these kinds of proceedings. The principaldifferences between the 1986 Model Rules and the Commission's EAJA rules,as well as several other matters, are treated individually in the section-by-sectionanalysis below. The analysis does not address departures from the ModelRules decided upon when the Commission initially adopted its EAJA rulesin 1981,\2\<NOTE/> unless modifications in the differences are proposed. Twonew provisions not in the Model Rules also are being proposed. The firstwould delegate authority to the Chief Administrative Law Judge to assignEAJA applications to particular administrative law judges. The second wouldadd a sentence to the EAJA rule on settlements to make it explicit thatsettlements may include a waiver of all EAJA fees.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Act Release No. 6368 (Dec. 18, 1981), 47 FR 609(1982).<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-By-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 201.31, Purpose of these rules \3\The<NOTE/> present andSection; 201.31, unlike the Model Rules, includesa finding that the EAJA rules do not impose a burden on competition. Thisfinding was correct and remains so, but it need not appear in the rulesand should be deleted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The section numbers appearing in the text are from theCommission's regulations in Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations.Corresponding Model Rule numbers are noted. 17 CFR 201.31 corresponds toModel Rule 315.101 (1 CFR 315.101).Section 201.32, When the Act appliesCertain of the applicability provisions of the New Model Rule pertain onlyto Board of Contract Appeal cases. Since the Commission does not hear suchcases, this section does not include such provisions.Section 201.33, Proceedings covered \4\Both<NOTE/> the original and revised Model Rules state that the agency'slist of its adversary adjudications (Appendix at 17 CFR 201.60 in the Commission'srules) is not necessarily exhaustive and that an applicant may seek anaward for other proceedings it believes the EAJA covers, with the issueof coverage to be decided at the time of the application. The Commissionproposes revising its rule to include this statement so as to preservethe possibility of considering an application of the EAJA to proceedingsnot listed in the Appendix, if justified in the particular circumstances.A Commission investigation, however, is not an adversary adjudication coveredby the EAJA.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Model Rule 315.103.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See Family Television Inc. v. SEC, </T3>608 F. Supp. 882 (D.D.C. 1985).Section201.34, Eligibility of applicants \6\Besides<NOTE/> raising financial eligibility ceilings, the 1986 Model Rulesand the 1985 EAJA also add a reference to ``unit of local government''in describing types of eligible organizations. The Commission's currentEAJA rules do not refer specifically to units of local governments butdo mention ``[a]ny other * * * public or private organization with a networth of'' the statutory amount. The Commission proposes to follow thenew Model Rules for the sake of uniformity and conformity with the wordingof the statute.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Model Rule 315.104.Section 201.35, Standards for awads\7\The<NOTE/> Model Rule corresponding to this section of the Commissionrules has a new sentence describing the ``agency position'' that must be``substantially justified'' to avoid an EAJA award: ``The position of theagency includes, in addition to the position taken by the agency in theadversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the agency uponwhich the adversary adjudication is based.'' This sentence reflects a changein the statute, but it is primarily relevant to agencies in which, forexample, officers grant or deny applications for benefits subject to appealto the agency head in an adversary adjudication. The ``position of theagency'' will now include the lower officer's initial decision, regardlessof the position taken in the subsequent adversarial phase.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Model Rule 315.105.However, EAJA claims before the Commission generally arise in administrativeproceedings where there is no relevant initial position different fromthe agency's position in the adversary adjudication. Challenges to otherCommission actions, such as rulemaking, do not come before the Commissionin adversary adjudications but are filed directly in a federal districtor appellate court. Nevertheless, the Commission proposes to include thenew sentence for the sake of conformity with the language of the statute.Section 315.105 of the Model Rules also drops the reference to a substantiallyjustified position as one ``reasonable in law and fact.'' The Commissionproposes to retain this phrase. The case law and the legislative historyindicate that the test is inevitably one of reasonableness, the only questionbeing one of degree. To abandon the formulation ``reasonable in law andfact' would suggest imposing a heavier burden on the staff than the legislativehistory and case law justify.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See, e.g., Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Meese, </T3>791 F.2d 1489, 1497(11th Cir. 1986); <T3>Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management, </T3>785 F.2d 1568, 1578-79(Fed. Cir. 1986); <T3>Russell v.

No. 253, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1979).Section201.36, Allowable fees and expenses \9\The<NOTE/> Commission's current rule disallows any award for expensesincurred in making the EAJA application itself. This provision is in neitherthe old nor the new Model Rules and should be dropped.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Model Rule 315.106.Section 201.37, Delegations of authority\10\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Model Rule 315.109. This section is unchanged in the Model Rules, but past experience withinthe Commission suggests that it would be desirable expressly to delegateresponsibility for the initial assignment of EAJA applications. Therefore,the Commission proposes to amend andSection; 201.37 to delegate assignmentresponsibility to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. A corresponding amendmentto 17 CFR 200.30-10, the section containing general delegations to theChief Administrative Law Judge, also is being proposed. Section 201.44, When an application may be filed \11\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Model Rule 315.204. The Commission is not proposing to follow changes in this section of theModel Rules that deal with appeals by the United States to a court, sincethe United States does not appear in Commission adjudications. The Commissionstaff might be regarded as the ``United States'' for purposes of the rule,but the staff cannot appeal from an adverse Commission adjudication. Section 201.54, Settlement \12\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Model Rule 315.305. The Model Rules have not been revised here, but the Commission proposesto add a sentence to its rule to make clear that settlements may includeterms effecting a waiver of EAJA claims. \13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See Evans v. Jeff D., </T3>475 S. Ct. 717 (1986), a civil rights classaction where the Supreme Court approved inclusion of a fee waiver in thesettlement of litigation that was subject to a fee-shifting statute. Section201.55, Further proceedings \14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Model Rule 315.306. The 1986 Model Rules revise this section to provide that the issue of substantialjustification is ordinarily to be determined from the administrative record.However, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, the adjudicatingofficer may order further proceedings. The Commission proposes to followthis revision. However, the new Model Rule refers to ``discovery,'' aswell as further evidentiary hearings, on other EAJA issues such as eligibilityand substantiation of expenses. While the Commission's current rule, likethe Model Rule, provides for further evidentiary hearings in appropriatecases, it does not mention ``discovery.'' Rule 8(d) of the Commission'sRules of Practice provides for procedures to be used in the schedule ofconferences and exchange of memoranda in connection with hearings to whichthe Commission is a party. The Commission's procedural rules do not, however,provide for a system of prehearing discovery, on EAJA or any other issues,at least not of the type ordinarily implied by the term ``discovery.''Therefore, the Commission proposes not to employ the term ``discovery''in its revised EAJA rules. The Commission proposes to revise this sectionto make clear that a judge in an EAJA hearing may require the same proceduresas are set forth in Rule 8(d) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.Section 201.59, Payment of award \15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Model Rule 315.310. The Commission's present rule and the 1981 Model Rules expressly providefor suspension of payment if a party has sought judicial review of theEAJA award or of the underlying case. The 1986 Model Rules delete thisprovision without explanation.\16\<NOTE/> Under the new Model Rules, to obtain payment the successfulEAJA applicant must certify that he will not appeal the award he has received.The Model Rule, however, does not address situations where (1) an appealof the award is nonetheless made, or (2) the underlying case is appealed.In the first situation, no award should be paid, as is clear from the Commission'spresent rule. No change is needed here. However, in the second situation,an appeal should only concern issues different from those as to which anEAJA award has been made, because the EAJA applicant prevailed on thoseissues. There is no reason to delay payment on the EAJA award pending anappeal over different issues, and the Commission proposes to modify itsrule accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>Compare </T3>51 FR 16665, 16669 <T3>with </T3>50 FR at 46256. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </ITAG>The Chairman of the Commission has certified that the proposed regulationswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.
