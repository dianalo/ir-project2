The black Anglican prelate told a U.N. committee Friday thatSouth Africa ``is able to cock a snoot (thumb its nose) to theworld ... because the South African government knows that when itcomes to the crunch, President Reagan, (British Prime MinisterMargaret) Thatcher and (West German) Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl willuse their veto to protect the South African government from theconsequences of its actions.   ``We don't suggest that these worthies are racists,'' he said inobvious sarcasm, ``but it is an academic distinction.''   The Western countries say they deplore apartheid but thinksanctions hurt the black population and do not help end the systemof racial separation.   The United States and Britain have veto power as permanentmembers of the U.N. Security Council. West Germany does not have aveto.   Tutu addressed a meeting of the U.N. Special Committee againstApartheid on the 25th anniversary of the committee's founding.   South Africa has defied all United Nations resolutionscondemning apartheid and calling for independence for Namibia, orSouth-West Africa. The South African ambassador recently stalkedout of the Security Council and said it could do its ``damndest''to impose sanctions on his country.   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his non-violentefforts to end apartheid, called the system ``as evil, as immoralas Nazism ever was.''   ``Is it too much to ask that in the land of our birth, we walktall as human beings made in the image of God? ... To say we wantto be free?''   Joining him were the Rev. Allan Boesak, also an anti-apartheidleader in South Africa, and almost 20 speakers, who called forrenewed dedication to the peaceful abolition of apartheid.   ``Help us,'' the archbishop appealed, ``because we want theemergence of a new South Africa where black and white people wouldlive amicably together.   ``Is it too much to ask to exert pressure to persuade the SouthAfrican government to come to the conference table?'' he asked.   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   He condemned the ban on 17 organizations and individuals opposedto apartheid and also said the South African news media is severelyrestricted and ``collaborates in self-censorship.''</TEXT></DOC>
