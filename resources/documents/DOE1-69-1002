<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-1002 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lasers have been extensively used in recent years to induce gas-surfacephotochemistry. There exist, however, relatively few mechanistic studieson well characterized surfaces involving electronic excitation of adsorbedmolecules. We have recently investigated the electronic excitation effectof CH/sub 2/I/sub 2/ molecules adsorbed on a sapphire crystal and silversurfaces with a XeCl laser. The molecule is chosen because it is readilyactivated by the 308 nm light pulses into its first and antibonding state.The excited molecules can dissociate into CH/sub 2/I radicals and I atomswith a unit quantum yield in the gas phase.</TEXT></DOC>
