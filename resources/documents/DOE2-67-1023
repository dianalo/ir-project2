<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-1023 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two types of niobium superconducting resonators used in the Saclay linacare discussed. The outer cylinder and RF ports are identical for thetwo designs, but internal structures are different: full wave helix withthree gaps behavior; or half wave with two gaps behavior. All cavities(34 full wave, 16 half) were tested for field and mounted in the machinecryostats. Cavity fabrication and performance are summarized. Vibrationtests and Rf control are described. It is argued that helix resonatorscan overcome problems due to vibration. The very low lock out time percentagemeasured in an acceleration test with 21 cavities supports this confidence.</TEXT></DOC>
