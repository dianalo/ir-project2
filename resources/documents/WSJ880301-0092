At Pennsylvania State University and the University of Virginia, small technical companies interview more students than IBM and General Electric Co. Manufacturers and steel producers are back in force at Carnegie-Mellon University and Case Western Reserve University, looking for accountants and engineers. For banks, &quot;a major combining English or philosophy with economics is very powerful,&quot; says an official at Ohio's Kenyon College.    While the variety of recruiters has increased, starting salary offers only match increases in inflation. And students are wary: Many have seen a parent laid off and have read of other cutbacks, so they may be less loyal to new employers, says Case Western Reserve's placement director.    Today's students want to enjoy their lives and won't &quot;work endless hours, even for high salaries,&quot; says a University of Massachusetts official.    A FEMALE SURGEON was dismissed because of bias against the handicapped.    A Detroit-area federal judge found that Marta Ross, a former vascular surgeon at William Beaumont Hospital in Troy, Mich., wasn't the victim of sex discrimination when her hospital privileges were suspended. Rather, he agreed with hospital officials that her verbal abuse of nurses and patients prompted the dismissal.    But in a later trial, a jury agreed with the doctor's claim that she had suffered discrimination because of her obesity and narcolepsy, a condition that the hospital claimed caused her to fall asleep during surgery, and awarded her $600,000 in damages. Dr. Ross's condition was controlled with medication, and she denies falling asleep while operating. -   CONTRACTING OUT for local goods and services gets mixed reviews.    Panama City, Fla., finds using private firms to collect trash and manage its civic center works well, although it still must hire extra crews for emergency cleanup services after heavy storms. The town saves $125,000 a year on trash pickups, and use of its civic center is up 50%; local workers aren't unionized. Union protests in San Francisco limit use of private contractors there, but the practice still is common.    Peralta College of Oakland, a state facility, canceled a contract to run its computer center because of the expense and union pressures. But New York City found it can save $2 million a year by making its own asphalt. And a recent $5 billion computer contract led to the conviction of several city officials for corruption.    In Essex County, N.J., county carpenters built a desk for $700 modeled after one a supplier priced at $3,500.    WORKING WOMEN'S HEALTH: At a recent Washington, D.C., conference, experts criticized various industries and the government for failing to address injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, a disabling wrist ailment, and reproductive hazards that affect mostly women. Participants called for stricter standards from OSHA.    THE MINIMUM WAGE should be raised but not automatically increased each year as inflation rises, says a House Small Business Committee staff report. The study also suggests permitting states to use a subminimum &quot;training&quot; wage and favors increasing an exemption for very small business, by tying the waiver to inflation.    VARIABLE PAY packages for top executives that are based on performance too often use &quot;soft,&quot; subjective measures, says Steven Gross, head of compensation for the Hay Group, consultants. A Hay survey shows performance pay becoming more popular, but Mr. Gross warns that to work for lower-paid employees, it must be based on hard results.    PARKING PERK: An employee who pays for downtown parking receives a greater after-tax benefit from nontaxable employer-paid parking than from receiving a wage raise in an equal amount, says Peat Marwick, accountants. Companies benefit as well because they needn't pay a Social-Security tax on the benefit.    EMPLOYER LIABILITY for bad hiring and firing decisions rises, a study says.    Since the early 1980s, many more courts are holding companies legally responsible for everything from assaults by workers (on customers or co-workers) to unfair dismissals, says a study published by the Bureau of National Affairs. Employer defenses include arguing that a worker's illegal actions weren't related to his employment and that an employee's dismissal was a normal part of the employment relationship.    The most effective defenses, however, are preventive measures such as meticulous screening of potential workers and careful performance reviews. Last year, suits for wrongful discharge increased 22% in California, a trend-setter on the issue, says Victor Schacter, a San Francisco management attorney.    Damage awards in the California cases were in the $400,000 range during the last two years, Mr. Schacter says.    THE CHECKOFF: The worst time for professionals to lose a job is around age 45, just as they might move into the management ranks, says Lee, Hecht Harrison Inc., consultants . . . Liability insurance cost consulting engineering firms more than $250 million last year, says the American Consulting Engineers Council. It suggests reforming product-liability laws and adopting quality-control measures. </TEXT></DOC>
