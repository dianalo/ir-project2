The flamboyant Campeau was a celebrity among Canadianbusinessmen in the United States, the poor boy from decidedlyunglamorous Sudbury, Ontario, who made his Canadian fortune in realestate and then bought the parent of New York-based Bloomingdale'sas the crown jewel of his new retailing strategy.   The $6.6 billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc. inApril 1988 was the biggest Canadian acquisition ever in the UnitedStates. It followed Campeau's 1986 acquisition of New York-basedAllied Stores Corp. for $3.6 billion.   On Thursday night, the directors of Campeau Corp. announced theyplanned to give up control of their U.S. retailing operations,which are struggling to regroup under the mountain of debt incurredwhen Campeau bought them.   Robert Campeau said he would be involved only in the company'sreal estate operations, removing himself from leadership of the 260U.S. department stores.   Campeau's fall has not generated much evident sympathy in hisnative country.   Canadians frequently tend to view with a certain amount ofskepticism their countrymen who succeed too well, especially ifthey make too much noise about it.   ``It gave me a great feeling as a Canadian to reverse the factAmericans have always bought a great deal of Canada,'' Campeau saidin an interview with the Toronto Star at the time of the Federatedtakeover. ``Canada is still my favorite country. It's not Canada'sfault we have messed it up.''   Harold Crookell, a professor at the University of WesternOntario's business school, said Canadians seem to have lesspatience than Americans for the ``Donald Trump syndrome'' offlaunting wealth and power.   ``Americans tend to laugh it off, but Canadians see that asthreatening to the poor, threatening to those in need,'' Crookellsaid in a phone interview. ``There is a somewhat more egalitarianfeeling in Canada than the United States.''   But, he said, ``I don't think anyone particularly has strongpositive emotions toward the multimillionaires in life. I don'tknow that Canada is unique.''   Financial analysts suggested for some time that Campeau paid toomuch for Federated, and the extent of his difficulties surfaced inSeptember when Bloomingdale's was put up for sale.   Canadian Business magazine dropped Campeau from 12th to 36thplace on its annual ``power list'' of the nation's business leaderslast fall after he started relinquishing control of the corporationand allowed a restructuring committee to take control of solvingthe financial crisis.   Toronto, Canada's business center, has a notablyEnglish-Canadian traditional elite. Campeau, a French-Canadian withan eighth-grade education, moved here after spectacular success inreal estate in Ottawa, the federal capital.   Despite his 11,000-square foot mansion at Toronto's mostprestigious address, he never lost his image as an outsider.Campeau complained about it, in what some said was a form ofboasting.   Yet the plans announced Thursday night apparently intended toseparate the U.S. division from the Toronto-based parent letCampeau retain a role in Canadian business, and few people ofinfluence here are willing to speak publicly about him.   Memories linger of his 1980 clash with the WASP elite of BayStreet, Canada's Wall Street, which blocked him from taking overthe financial institution Royal Trustco Ltd. Campeau then went onto seek bigger targets in the United States.   ``I tend to think that privately they are (gloating),'' MichaelBabad, co-author of a book published in Canada last fall aboutCampeau, said Friday. ``He caused them a lot of trouble in 1980.''   Campeau came back from that and other setbacks, leading tospeculation that even the serious difficulties on his biggest dealmight not be his finale.   ``If anyone can bounce back, it's Bob Campeau, because hishistory has always shown that he can,'' Babad said in an interview.   Canadian investment has increased sharply in the United Statesand is expected to grow more under the free trade agreement thattook effect a year ago. Major successes can be tracked in realestate, communications and other areas, but Campeau's difficulty isonly the latest and biggest in a series of Canadian misadventuresin American retailing.   For example, Imasco Ltd. of Montreal had problems with thePeoples Drug Store chain in the United States and Toronto-basedCanadian Tire ran into difficulty with an auto stores investment inthe southwestern United States.</TEXT></DOC>
