Economists expect the prime rate to fall further -- by asmuch as 1.5 percentage points -- and for other short-terminterest rates to decrease over the next few months unlessthe U.S. becomes involved in a war with Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   The drop in the prime rate, a benchmark that determinesthe rates charged on loans to most small and medium-sizedbusinesses and some individuals, had been widely anticipatedsince the Federal Reserve Board lowered two key short-termrates about two weeks ago, citing concerns about weakness inthe economy.   The broad-based drop in the prime is clearly welcome newsfor borrowers whose loan rates are pegged to the prime. Butseveral economists said yesterday's actions alone won't givethe economy much of a boost. Only a further decline ininterest rates and more signals from the Fed and other bankregulators that banks should make more loans will produce thedesired economic turnaround, they said.   &quot;Obviously, it can't hurt, but the drop in the prime rateby itself is not going to turn things around,&quot; said Irwin L.Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Corp. &quot;Notonly do we need easier money and cheaper money, which we'regetting, but the Fed and the bank regulators need to send aclear signal to the banks that it's OK for them to go out anddo what their charter says to do, which is to lend money,&quot;Mr. Kellner said.   Several bank economists, including Alfred Smith of NCNBCorp. and Mr. Kellner, predict that the prime rate will dropto 8.5% by midyear.   Other bank economists, including Helen Roberts of FirstChicago Corp., which dropped its prime rate to 9.5% on Dec.20, believe the prime will fall faster and farther. Ms.Roberts predicts that the prime will hit a low of 7.75% inMay. &quot;We expect the Fed will be pretty aggressive abouteasing,&quot; Ms. Roberts said. She expects the Fed will push thefederal funds rate, which is the rate that banks charge forovernight loans to each other, down to 6% in April from 7%today.   The federal funds rate is one of the two key rates thatthe Fed lowered in mid-December. The other is the discountrate, the rate the Fed charges on short-term loans to banks,which the Fed lowered on Dec. 18 to 6.5% from 7%.   The prime rate had been stuck at 10% for nearly a year. Itwas last lowered to 10% from 10.5% in early January of 1990.   The drop yesterday by about three dozen of the nation'slargest banks should put to rest, at least temporarily, adebate about whether banks were moving as fast as they shouldto cut the prime. Since Dec. 20, the prime rate at most bigbanks was three full percentage points above the federalfunds rate, an unusually wide margin.   Mr. Smith of NCNB said he expects the prime to stay atmore than two percentage points above the federal funds ratefor some time, at least partly because of pressure on banksto improve their profits and build up their capital bases.   Some bank critics have speculated that banks may havedelayed dropping the prime because some loan rates aredetermined by the prime rate on the last business day of amonth or quarter. Thus, by leaving the prime rate at 10% onDec. 31, the banks could benefit from an extra 30 to 90 daysof interest at the higher rate.   However, several bankers and economists said yesterdaythat most commercial loans tied to the prime change rateswhenever the prime moves up or down. The end-of-quarter orend-of-month rate formulas apply mostly to consumer loanstied to the prime, such as home equity loans and somecredit-card loans. Though home equity loans have been afast-growing line of business at some banks in the last fewyears, the great majority of prime-based lending involvesbusinesses with sales of less than $100 million a year.   Bank economists continued to blame the delay in droppingthe prime on fears that short-term rates might surge atyear-end, as they often do. This year, however, short termsrates dropped in the last few days of the years, largelybecause the Fed pumped reserves into the banking system.   Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., the main unit of J.P. Morgan andamp;Co., led the wave of prime-dropping yesterday morning,following BankAmerica's announcement late Monday. Citicorp'sCitibank, the nation's largest bank, quickly followed suit,as did more than 30 other New York and regional banks.   The biggest banking companies that haven't lowered theirprime rate to 9.5% are some of BankAmerica's toughestCalifornia competitors: Security Pacific Corp., FirstInterstate Bancorp., and Wells Fargo andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
