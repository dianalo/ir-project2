The horizontal flow of coolants near the free liquidsurface is reduced by the suppressing mechanism to effectively reducethe surface disturbance. The reduction in the liquid surface disturbancefurther prevails to the entire surface region with no particular verticalvariations to the free liquid surface to remarkably improve the preventiveperformance for the liquid surface disturbance. Accordingly, it is alsopossible to attain the advantageous effects such as prevention for thethermal fatigue in reactor vessel walls, reactor upper mechanisms, etc.and prevention of burning damage to the reactor core due to the reductionof envolved Ar gas.
