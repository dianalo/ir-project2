It is the single most important step we have taken to strengthen our economy since World War II.&quot;    He went on to say how the legislation was inspired and proposed by President Kennedy. It has been one year, one month, and two days since President Kennedy's first appeal to pass the bill -- and I'd hate to count hour to hour all of the calls, the talks, the reading, the work, the effort, the late night hours, that Lyndon has put in during the last three months to get it passed. But it did pass, by the happy majority of 74 to 19 in the Senate, with generous Republican support.    Lyndon's speech tried to explain two things. First, how the new law would mean something to each person, by putting an average of four or five dollars more a week into the pockets of most U.S. wage earners this year, beginning next week. And second, how by releasing millions of dollars into the private economy from corporations that would otherwise be saving it to pay their taxes, this would stimulate new expansion and encourage the growth and prosperity of the country. </TEXT></DOC>
