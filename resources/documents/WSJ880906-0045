The venture is the latest of a series of planned government-supported &quot;mega projects&quot; to develop some of Canada's high-cost oil resources for the 1990s.    The federal government recently agreed to provide as much as C$2.7 billion in grants and loan guarantees for development of the Hibernia oil field off the coast of Newfoundland. The federal government also is in negotiations to provide financial support for a C$4 billion project to mine and upgrade oil sand deposits in Alberta.    The projects are designed to replace Canada's declining reserves of conventional oil and to provide jobs and other economic benefits to the country's remote regions.    The planned conversion plant will be built and operated by a joint venture owned about 31.7% by the Canadian government, 26.7% by Husky, 24.2% by Alberta and 17.5% by Saskatchewan. Husky is 43%-owned by Nova Corp. of Alberta, 43% by Union Faith Ltd. of Hong Kong, 9% by Li Ka-shing and 5% by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.    The upgrading facility is to be capable of transforming the heavy oil and bitumen into about 46,000 barrels a day of a &quot;synthetic&quot; light crude that can be processed into various oil products by Canadian refineries in Sarnia, Ontario and Montreal. By contrast, Hibernia is scheduled to produce 110,000 barrels a day and the proposed new Alberta oil sands plant is to produce 75,000 barrels a day.    The federal and provincial governments decided to take a direct stake in the upgrader project after Husky was unable to persuade other companies to participate. Oil analysts have expressed skepticism about the project because the cost of upgrading the heavy crude oil currently exceeds substantially the spread between the prices for heavy and light crude oils. Canada currently exports much of its heavy oil to U.S. refineries.    Construction of the upgrading facility is to start this year and production is scheduled to start in 1992. Under the agreement, Husky will be recognized as having contributed C$100 million by prior investment for site acquisition and project engineering.    A federal government spokesman said the government's policy is &quot;to support investment in mega projects which play a part in unlocking Canada's rich resource base for the benefit of Canadians into the next century.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
