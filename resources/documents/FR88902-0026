Background </ITAG>Effective October 1, 1988, contract reporting will be accomplished usingrevised forms DD Form 350 and DD Form 1057. Extensive revisions have beenmade to the two forms and to DFARS Subpart 204.6. Much of the redesignpertains to the data elements that were previously added to Part E of theDD Form 350 for fiscal year 1988.In addition to changes to the forms, the instructions in DFARS Subpart204.6 have been extensively revised. In some cases, the instructions havebeen changed for clarity or simplification without a corresponding changeto the forms. The numbering of subsections within 204.671-5 and 204.672-5has been revised to simplify text search and reference. Four additional data elements have been added (items B4, B5E, B5F, B5G)to capture data regarding Taxpayer Identification Numbers at a future time.These data elements are to be left blank until further regulations areissued. The corresponding text at 204.671-5 is reserved.A new data element (D4E) concerns the percent of premium associated withspecial treatment for disadvantaged businesses and institutions.Orders under Federal Schedules and under another agency's contract havebeen revised in Item B13, Kind of Contracting Action, and changes shouldbe noted at Item C2, Reason Not Synopsized; Item C5, Type of Contract;Item C13C, Place of Manufacture; and Item D1, Type of Business. Item D4,Preference Program, is a restructuring for reporting of preference programsand Item E1 is a relocation of Consulting Service Contract.Various other report elements have been simplified or clarified, and clauseshave been restructured at 252.204.Coverage regarding Distribution of Defense Subcontracts Placed Overseas,formerly at 204.670-4, has been restructured and relocated at 204.674.The clause at 252.204-7005 has also been restructured.With respect to awards of $25,000 and less, revisions have been made tobe consistent with the data collected on the DD Form 350 and in the FederalProcurement Data System.<ITAG tagnum="84">B.
