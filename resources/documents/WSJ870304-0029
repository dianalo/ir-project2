John Poindexter, the former national security adviser, opted to remain in the Navy, although dropping to a two-star rank of rear admiral.    He was scheduled to decide whether to retire or to continue at lower rank, for reasons unrelated to investigations into his role in the arms shipments to Iran and the diversion of funds to Nicaraguan rebels. Adm. Poindexter was temporarily promoted to three-star status while he served in the White House job. His annual pay will remain the same at about $80,000.    Navy Secretary John Lehman said that Adm. Poindexter will serve on the long-range planning staff of the chief of naval operations. &quot;His unique experience and expertise can really be of genuine help&quot; in the post, Mr. Lehman said. </TEXT></DOC>
