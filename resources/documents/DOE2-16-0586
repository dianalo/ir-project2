This study was conducted in Oct. 1987wherein the coal seams were excited by the hydraulic crushing to removethe gas efficiently. depth of testing was 850 m underground. This hydrauliccrushing test showed that the pulsation of hydraulic pressure and theincrease/decrease of temporary hydraulic pressure corresponded with AEevent, which showed that the crack-formation does not always proceedstationarily but a distribution suddenly occurs. Crack caused by AE isspread in a surface which is vertical to the direction of the minimummain stress. Direction of stress change of the periphery rocks coincideswith that at the hydraulic crushing.
