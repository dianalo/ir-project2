The tomb, officials said, was the burial place for awarrior-priest of the Moche people, a civilization that dominatedthe Peruvian area from 100 A.D. to about the end of the 7th century.   ``This is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically inthe western hemisphere,'' according to Christopher B. Donnan, anexpert on ancient Peru.   Walter Alva, director of the Bruning Archaeological Museum inLambayeque, Peru, said that the area near the village of Sipan maybe the burial site for a succession of high-ranking Moche leadersand that other tombs with more treasure may be found.   ``I am sure that when we finish digging here, we will know moreabout the life, social and economic organization, the metallurgicalknowledge and religious practices of the Moche,'' Alva was quotedas saying in an announcement released by the National GeographicSociety.   Officials said the Moche peoples dominated the Peruvian areaprior to the time of the Inca civilization. The Incas were the mostpowerful group in the area at the time of the Spanish conquest inthe 1530s.   The Moche tomb was discovered after authorities learned inJanuary 1987, that a number of remarkably fine gold and silverartifacts were being sold on the black market in Peru. Policeraided the home of a tomb robber and, after a shoot out that killedone person, recovered some of the treasures.   Information gathered from the raid led to the Sipan area and thetomb was found after careful excavation.   Among the treasures found were a crown, mask, knives and jewelryof gold, along with more than 1,000 ceramic and copper artifacts.   In addition to the warrior-priest, the tomb also contained theremains of two women and three other men, all apparently part of aceremonial entombment ritual.   Excavation of the tomb was financed by the National GeographicSociety under the auspices of the Peruvian government.</TEXT></DOC>
