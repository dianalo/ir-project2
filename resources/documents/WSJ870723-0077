The nine-member committee won't meet until next week, when it will begin to fashion official positions, and the four members interviewed emphasized that their views are their own and don't represent committee policy.    Nonetheless, most of the committee members interviewed, each of whom owns at least 25,000 Texaco shares, don't want the company to rush into a compromise settlement with Pennzoil. Nor do they want Texaco to pay anywhere near the $4.1 billion Pennzoil is seeking to end the litigation over Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co.    White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors' lawsuits under the federal Bankruptcy Code last April to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment against it, awarded to Houston-based Pennzoil by a Texas jury in December 1985.    &quot;We support Texaco management fully,&quot; said Kurt Lindner, president of Lindner Fund Inc., which owns or jointly controls 298,000 Texaco shares. As for Pennzoil's $4.1 billion settlement offer, Mr. Lindner said, &quot;It stinks,&quot; adding that &quot;the settlement figure should be zero.&quot;    &quot;Pennzoil wants us to identify with the aggressor and rebel against our own management,&quot; said Joseph Iny, a Deal, N.J., investor. &quot;It's a crude maneuver that shows Pennzoil is losing control of events.&quot; Mr. Iny said he doesn't want Texaco to pay any settlement and would strongly protest a settlement higher than $200 million to $300 million. &quot;It's not in our interest to settle,&quot; he said.    John H. Morrison Jr., a retired Texaco worker, said he &quot;wouldn't offer Pennzoil anything,&quot; adding, &quot;As far as I'm concerned, you could use that Texas judgment as toilet paper.&quot; Nonetheless, Mr. Morrison said he had been &quot;discouraged to see Texaco go into bankruptcy&quot; proceedings, and would rather see the case settled than dragged out in court. He said that Pennzoil's plan &quot;would never go through&quot; and that he would stick by Texaco management's decisions.    A committee member who didn't want to be identified also opposes Pennzoil's offer. &quot;Our reading of the legal situation is that Texaco has better than a 50-50 chance to win outright&quot; its appeal of the judgment to the Texas Supreme Court. While hoping that Texaco won't pay any settlement, the committee member said he wouldn't balk &quot;if Texaco can settle for less than $1 billion.&quot;    These committee members' support of Texaco management in some ways echoes that expressed in a letter by Robert Holmes a Court, the Australian financier who holds a 9.6% stake in the company and is seeking approval to raise his holding to 15%. In his letter Tuesday, Mr. Holmes a Court told Texaco, &quot;It would seem abundantly clear to me that the interests of management and shareholders in Texaco are one and the same and we would certainly give our support to the management of Texaco in our capacity as a significant shareholder.&quot;    The equity holders committee could play a big role in how Texaco emerges from Chapter 11. In reorganization cases involving insolvent companies, equity holders normally &quot;are at the bottom of the totem pole and play the role of gadflies,&quot; said Jack Gross, chief bankruptcy lawyer at Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan, the New York law firm that represents Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., a Texaco creditor. But in Texaco's case, all creditors -- except Pennzoil -- have been told they will be paid 100 cents on the dollar. And, Mr. Gross said, that makes it &quot;highly probable&quot; that any Texaco reorganization plan containing a settlement to Pennzoil would &quot;involve some dilution of equity in order to pay creditors.&quot;    The equity holders committee will have a role that is as important or perhaps even more important than the creditors committees, Mr. Gross said. &quot;Equity holders' interests are likely to be impaired and their approval of a plan will be essential,&quot; he added.    Harvey Miller, Texaco's bankruptcy lawyer, said that because Texaco is solvent, shareholders have more at stake in its bankruptcy-law case than shareholders of insolvent companies. As a result, &quot;The equity holders committee will be a major party of interest in the proceedings,&quot; he said. Mr. Miller said that while bankruptcy law provides for approval of a reorganization plan without the consent of shareholders, he hopes that this won't be necessary. </TEXT></DOC>
