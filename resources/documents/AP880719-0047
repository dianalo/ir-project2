WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis escaped the crowds for a brisk``power walk'' through a city park, then endured a gantlet ofnetwork interviews and technical glitches before settling in towatch the televised version of the convention that will nominatehim for president.   Awaiting his formal nomination on Wednesday, Dukakis saw theopening night of the Democratic National Convention on a bank ofcolor televisions in his penthouse suite at a hotel just blocksfrom the convention hall.   He tuned in just as the keynote speech by Texan Ann Richardsbegan, and he phoned her immediately afterward.   ``What am I going to say on Thursday?'' he told her. ``You saidit all.''   With the resolution of campaign tensions between himself andJesse Jackson apparently out of the way, Dukakis was going today tothe Martin Luther King Jr. Center and gravesite for a tour andspeech. Accompanying him were the slain civil rights leader'swidow, Coretta Scott King, and Dukasis' designated running mate,Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.   Following a relaxed schedule, Dukakis took top aide NickMitropolous to Atlanta's Piedmont Park on Monday afternoon for someexercise _ despite the muggy, 90-degree plus weather.   A former jogger who now prefers fast walks, Dukakis carriedfour-pound weights in each hand and moved his arms vigorously witheach step in what he calls a ``power walk'' exercise. They went tothe park without the national press entourage that is otherwiseever present when he moves around the city, and they walked forthree miles.   ``We didn't see a single Bush supporter in the park,'' Dukakisdeadpanned hours later, talking with aides and a reporter as hemoved between suites at his hotel.   The Massachusetts governor was joined in his private quarters bythe speaker of his state House, George Kevarian, and he took a fewmoments to talk with top state aides back in Boston by phone.   ``Compared to the Boston Statehouse, this is a day at thebeach,'' he said.   Dukakis also spent time working on his nomination acceptancespeech to be delivered Thursday night. He didn't plan to enter theconvention hall until that night.   Dukakis' three-hour meeting with Jackson early in the dayproduced talk of party unity by both men.   The main order of business for Dukakis' evening was the seriesof interviews he conducted with the four network anchors. NBC, CBS,ABC and CNN each had their turn, using control rooms set up nearwhere Dukakis and aides are staying.   Aside from the expected questions about the Jackson settlement,Dukakis faced some unexpected remarks _ like when NBC anchor TomBrokaw related the tale that Dukakis was so frugal he once took apiece of hard candy from his mouth before a speech, saved it andresumed enjoying it afterward.   Off camera, he later explained that his motive was to avoid amess: ``I didn't want to leave it there, so I stuck it back in mymouth.''   Before his ABC interview, however, Dukakis sat silently whiletechnicians shouted back and forth over multiple audio lines abouta sound failure that lasted right up to airtime. ``Why doesn't hehear Peter Jennings?'' a control-room voice repeated.   ``I'm sorry for all that,'' anchor Jennings said into Dukakis'earpiece seconds before they went on live, his sound line to thegovernor restored. ``I think it's designed to drive us all crazy 30seconds before air.''   As the show came on, Mitropolous and other aides watched from anext-door bedroom that was converted into a control room. Theanchor quoted an unidentified senior aide to Dukakis as saying,``We want a convention that is organized, orderly and short _ justlike our candidate.''   Stunned, the assembled aides groaned. Dukakis, who is 5-foot-8,didn't flinch.   ``He can take a punch,'' a producer for a rival network saidlater.</TEXT></DOC>
