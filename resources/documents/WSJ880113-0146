Robert Dole is about to make a campaign swing through Iowa and New England -- and he doesn't even have to worry about the snow.    Instead, he smiles amiably at a camera in a studio a block from the Capitol, answering questions posed by four television stations in Iowa and one in Boston linked to the studio by satellite. The GOP presidential candidate waves a copy of a missile-reduction treaty and drops the names of world leaders he says he consulted before agreeing to support the treaty. He promises one rural station: &quot;Agriculture will be a top priority in a Dole administration.&quot;    The half-hour satellite feed costs the Dole campaign $690 -- less than a single 30-second advertisement following an evening newscast in Boston. The candidate is delighted with his investment. &quot;I was all over Iowa today,&quot; Sen. Dole says happily after the interviews. &quot;When I'm there, I can usually only make three stops.&quot;    Even as network news operations are cutting back on their political coverage, many local television stations are taking advantage of satellite technology to vastly expand their ability to cover presidential politics. But the emergence of the local stations on the national scene carries with it problems as well.    Critics say the new technology helps candidates stage-manage the news by paying for coverage: Candidates now routinely pay for satellite interviews and transmit video news releases, debates and speeches to local stations, which weave the material into their newscasts. Moreover, some local stations lack the political savvy to match their technological prowess, leaving them easy marks for manipulation by the campaigns.    Nonetheless, local correspondents are increasingly showing up on the press planes and buses, working shoulder to shoulder with network correspondents. Boston station WBZ-TV says it will spend $20,000 to pay for satellite time and to rent a satellite truck, which can transmit video instantly from anywhere, to cover the Iowa caucuses next month. Its Boston rival, WCVB-TV, is using satellites to profile five families around the country, interviewing them about the campaign and letting the families question the candidates. Sixty-eight member stations of Conus Communications, a Minneapolis satellite consortium, swap campaign coverage by satellite.    &quot;More and more, local stations consider presidential politics their story,&quot; says Bill Nigut, a reporter at WSB-TV in Atlanta. Mr. Nigut has traveled with nearly all the presidential candidates -- dashing to studios to beam his newscasts to Atlanta -- and plans to spend the next several weeks profiling Iowa and New Hampshire.    Presidential candidates are doing their best to feed the growing local appetite for campaign news. Rep. Richard Gephardt hired a video production crew to follow him around in Iowa and Alabama, produce short videotapes and beam them to stations around the country by satellite. He and Rep. Jack Kemp also split the cost of transmitting two debates nationally by satellite and arranging follow-up interviews with a dozen local stations.    The ground rules are still evolving for local stations attempting to cover the national story. Letting campaigns pay for the costs of a satellite interview, as Mr. Dole's campaign did, is one area of hot contention. Jon Resnick, political editor of WBZ, defends the practice: &quot;We get to ask the questions; we retain editorial control.&quot;    But Philip Balboni, news director of rival Boston station WCVB-TV, sharply disagrees. &quot;Candidates are getting perilously close to buying news coverage,&quot; he says. When Vice President George Bush's campaign booked $3,000 of studio and satellite time for local-station interviews following Mr. Bush's meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, WCVB insisted on reimbursing the campaign about $100 as its share of the costs.    A Paul Simon satellite feed from the Jefferson-Jackson Day celebration in Iowa in November offers a look at how campaigns can package their candidates. The feed showed a Simon march and rally for stations to use as a backdrop to news stories. Then, surrounded by cheering supporters, Sen. Simon did a series of brief live interviews with television stations in Chicago and around Iowa.    Steve Tuttle, news director of KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa, says he welcomed the Simon footage because it made the station's news operations &quot;look more extensive&quot; and made his workday easier. &quot;It's another minute and a half (on the news) we don't have to worry about,&quot; he says. But Anne Azzi, a political reporter at KTIV-TV in Sioux City, Iowa, turned down the interview because she felt the Simon campaign &quot;was trying to buy time at the top of the six o'clock news.&quot; In a live two-minute interview, she argues, she wouldn't have enough time to press him on tough questions, and couldn't edit out self-serving remarks.    Patrick Mitchell, Sen. Simon's Iowa coordinator, denies that the campaign was trying to influence coverage. &quot;We allowed anchors to ask questions of Paul Simon,&quot; he says. &quot;They could be as hard hitting as they wanted.&quot;    But Paul Risley, Sen. Albert Gore's deputy press secretary, observes: &quot;Anchors ask softball questions and give you a lot of time to get your message across.&quot;    One-on-One Exclusive, a Washington satellite service that arranges satellite interviews for local TV stations with Washington newsmakers, even writes questions for local reporters to ask. So far One-on-One, a division of Potomac Communications Inc., has set up interviews for Sen. Gore, Alexander Haig and Jesse Jackson -- charging as much as $700 for an interview. &quot;In the bluntest sense, they (the stations) are paying for access,&quot; says Bonnie Arnold, One-on-One's director. But Leslie Howell, a producer at WBBM-TV in Chicago, which used One-on-One to interview Sen. Gore, offers another rationale: Ethically, &quot;when we pay, we're in the clear.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Networks Grow Stingy With Their Camera Crews, No Longer Cover Every Sneeze of Campaign...&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 13, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
