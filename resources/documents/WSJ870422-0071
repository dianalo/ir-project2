FreedmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SGL DARTAFOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Supermarkets General Corp.'s board will meet today to consider a recapitalization proposal that was prompted by a now-withdrawn takeover bid from Dart Group Corp., sources said.    The plan will call for payments to Supermarkets General shareholders that could take the form of cash, debt or additional equity, sources said.    The plan appears to be an attempt to placate shareholders, who sat on the sidelines and watched Dart make two bids without receiving a response from the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer.    The sources didn't exclude the possibility of a leveraged buyout offer being considered by the board at its meeting today. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Supermarkets General declined to comment yesterday.    Since Dart withdrew its sweetened bid of more than $1.73 billion early this month, Supermarkets General shares have drifted down to the $40 area after reaching a peak of more than $45 a share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Supermarkets General closed at $41.125, up 75 cents.    Some analysts and shareholders have expressed irritation that Supermarkets General has taken so long to make up its mind and has remained silent about its intentions. The company has said only that it &quot;is actively engaged in seeking to maximize stockholders' values in the near term.&quot;    &quot;The long-term shareholders have to be confused,&quot; said Robert Raiff, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. &quot;Two months have gone by without adequate communication and that's why the stock is so volatile.&quot;    The size of the payments Supermarkets General is considering making to shareholders couldn't be determined. It also wasn't clear how the company would finance its recapitalization plan. But the sources said the financing wouldn't involve a &quot;major&quot; sale of assets. Previously, Wall Street analysts had speculated that Supermarkets General would sell its 45 Rickel stores, a home improvement chain.    Ever since early March, when Dart made its initial unsolicited bid of $1.62 billion, or $41.75 a share, Supermarkets General has expressed a strong desire to remain independent and has been weighing its alternatives. These included taking the company private, buying back some shares and making an acquisition of its own.    The company has also talked to potential friendly suitors, but Dart's proposed price appparently was viewed as a deterrent.    Dart, a Landover, Md.-based discount retailer, subsequently sweetened its bid to more than $1.73 billion, or $42 a share in cash, $3 a share in preferred stock and an undetermined amount of common stock in the surviving company. Then on April 6, it withdrew its proposal in an apparent attempt to pressure Supermarkets General into action. At the time, Dart said it remained interested in buying the food retailer and was &quot;prepared to compete to that end.&quot;    Reached in Washington, D.C., late yesterday, Robert Haft, Dart's president, said, &quot;We continue to be interested in acquiring Supermarkets General and remain willing to compete to that end.&quot;    Dart, which is controlled by Mr. Haft's family, currently holds 1.9 million shares of Supermarkets General, slightly less than 5% of its 38.5 million shares outstanding.    Some shareholders expressed the hope that the Supermarkets General plan will trigger another bid from the Hafts. &quot;The recapitalization plan Supermarkets General has been working on isn't going to be that great,&quot; a major shareholder predicted. &quot;But we expect that the Hafts will come back and push values (to shareholders) higher.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
