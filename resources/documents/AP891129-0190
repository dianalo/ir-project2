The review of the ``entire spectrum'' of public informationpolicies was occasioned by a series of news leaks about criminalinvestigations, including an FBI probe of Felix Bloch, the U.S.diplomat suspected of espionage, the attorney general said.   Thornburgh has attributed the FBI's inability so far to solvethe case on news accounts that disclosed the investigation lastsummer.   ``It was `let's leak like a sieve' when I got here,'' theattorney general said in an often-stormy session with reporters.   ``Peoples rights were being compromised, our investigations werebeing compromised by unauthorized disclosures of informationregarding criminal investigations,'' Thornburgh said.   Thornburgh launched a number of investigations of leaks, notablyto try to identify the source of information about an FBIinvestigation into financial practices in the office of Rep.William Gray III, D-Pa.   The leak occurred while Gray was seeking election in the Houseas majority whip, prompting accusations from Democratic lawmakersthat Thornburgh's aides were the source of a political leak.   The political firestorm also forced the Justice Department tostate several days later that Gray was not a target of theinvestigation and was cooperating with the probe.   Asked if he was satisfied that leak did not come from hisoffice, Thornburgh said: ``I haven't had an oportunity to reviewthe results of the investigation.''   Thornburgh disclosed the department-wide review, which beganearlier this fall, when questioned about proposed Bureau of Prisonsregulations that would restrict reporters interviews of federalinmates.   Later in the day, Thornburgh issued a statement saying he hadordered the Bureau of Prisons to withdraw the proposed regulations,saying ``this proposal was submitted prematurely and without mypersonal review. It will be subject to further review beforeresubmission.''   The regulations published this week would allow prison wardensto bar reporters who do not ``verify any allegations'' aboutprisons or inmates with corrections officials.   During his session with reporters, Thornburgh said the proposedregulations are intended to guarantee ``an accurate flow ofinformation ... and observe what is necessary to properly manageprison facilities.''   The attorney general did not cite specific examples ofinaccurate news stories, referring all questions to the Bureau ofPrisons, where a spokesman did not immediately return a reporter'stelephone call.   The department-wide review has also resulted in a new policy atthe Immigration and Naturalization Service.   Gene McNary, the new immigration commissioner, recently orderedINS officials nationwide to obtain permission from the agency'sWashington public affairs office before commenting publicly on awide range of issues.   ``It is necessary for us to speak with uniformity in discussingINS policies, operations, procedures, and other issues,'' McNarysaid in a Nov. 27 memo.   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said district and regional officialswill have discretion to answer reporters' questions about arrestsof illegal aliens or breaking news.   ``It's not a gagging, its not a silencing,'' Jervis said. ``It'sa means, I will use the word of controlling, of knowing what isbeing said in the field before you read it in the newspaper or seeit on television,'' Jervis said.   Thornburgh's session with reporters was punctuated by complaintsthat the attorney general had made it difficult for reporters toget even the most basic information about department operations.   ``Our subject is ordinary information, not sensitiveinformation, not criminal information,'' said one reporter.   ``We try to give it as best we can,'' Thornburgh said.   ``But we're not getting it,'' the reporter replied.   The attorney general acknowledged that ``my reputation with youfolks has deteriorated because you don't like the fact that I don'tcondone leaks or encourage leaks.''   ``We're not talking about leaks,'' the reporter repeated.   ``I am,'' Thornburgh replied. ``I am talking about what hasimpelled me to try to tighten up the process of discussion ofmatters'' in the department.</TEXT></DOC>
