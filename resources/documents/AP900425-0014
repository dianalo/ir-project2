A three-page list of Navy recommendations for closure,realignment and consolidation surfaced Tuesday during a hearing bytwo House Armed Services subcommittees.   The list drew immediate criticism from a lawmaker who releasedthe document, and a Navy statement that it was a preliminarycompilation and not a ``hit list.''   The Pentagon ``politically wants us to open and close bases atthe same time,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., who opposescontinued spending on new home ports nationwide.   Vice Adm. Stanley R. Arthur identified the list as candidatesfor closure and realignment drafted by Navy officials.   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, said later that thelist was an informal document that is part of the early stages ofthe service's review of all shore establishments. The review isexpected to be completed by July or August.   ``Appearance of a facility ... in no way indicates it's on somehit list,'' Quigley said.   Lawmakers also reacted angrily in January to Defense SecretaryDick Cheney's plan to close or scale back 72 domestic bases and 14overseas installations.   Democrats including Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of theHouse Armed Services Committee, criticized Cheney's list aspartisan for singling out bases in Democratic districts.   Navy officials appeared before the House Armed Services seapowerand military installations subcommittees Tuesday to discuss``strategic home porting,'' under which the Navy's fleet of 550ships are spread among 41 ports.   ``Strategic home porting remains a valid military objectivebecause of its beneficial effect on peacetime readiness,'' saidJacqueline Schafer, assistant secretary of the Navy forinstallations and environment.   She indicated, however, that the Navy is reviewing all itsinstallations, including the new home ports, for possible closureand realignments.   According to the list, closing the home port on Staten Island,N.Y., which is 90 percent complete, would cost $142 million andresult in annual savings of $7 million.   Navy spokesman Quigley said Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett IIImet with New York Mayor David Dinkins and stressed that the serviceplans to base its ships at Staten Island.   Shutting down the facility at Everett, Wash., the leastdeveloped of the home ports, would cost $20 million. Annual savingswere estimated at $22 million.   The other home ports on the list are in Ingleside, Texas;Mobile, Ala.; and Pascagoula, Miss.   Among other installations on the list were those at Hunter'sPoint, Calif., and Sand Point, Wash.; a naval air station inBrunswick, Maine; and a naval supply school in Athens, Ga., homestate of the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn.   The list also included consolidating 13 facilities, includingtwo at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; two in Michigan; twoin Oregon, and three in Wisconsin, Aspin's home state.   The Navy is considering keeping open six facilities that hadbeen included on Cheney's list as candidates for closure orrealignment. All are in California, including the naval station inAlameda and the shipyard in Long Beach.   At Tuesday's hearing, the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress, recommended that the DefenseDepartment withhold additional money for the home port projects dueto the changing situation worldwide, fiscal constraints and theunlikely chances of a 600-ship naval fleet ever being built.   The GAO also estimated that the cost of building and operatingthe new home ports would exceed $1 billion, compared with thePentagon's initial cost estimate of $799 million.</TEXT></DOC>
