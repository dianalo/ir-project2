Survey was carried out twice a year. The latestresults are from 1987. The center of subsidence appeared in the regionof shafts I, II and III. Geologic conditions in the area are described.As a consequence of deep water draining and seam 382 excavation, a subsidencetrough was formed with a reach of 3.5 km around the shafts and with adepth of 270 mm. The effect of excavation of the first longwall in seam382 appeared not earlier than after a year in the form of a slight subsidencewith a reach of 700 m and at a rate of 1.2-1.5 mm/month. The slownessof the subsidence was due to the thick and strong Cretaceous massif thatoverlies the Carboniferous formations. Similar phenomena were noted inthe Donetsk coal basin, while in the L'vov-Volynsk coal basin, wherecoal lies at shallower depths, the effects of exploitation appear muchfaster and their range is lower. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
