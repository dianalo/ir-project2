Consequently, in order to evaluate the possibility of extendingplant life time or of applying a leak-before-break concept into the pipingdesign in such plants, it is necessary to understand the behavior ofsubcritical crack growth in carbon steel pipes. This study focuses onthe behavior of subcritical crack growth in carbon steel used in RPVpressure boundary.</TEXT></DOC>
