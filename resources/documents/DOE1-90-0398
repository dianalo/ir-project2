It is shown thatstochastic differential equations relating an interacting {sigma} superfieldto the free one become linear if the field takes values in a generalizedPoincare upper half-plane. A renormalized perturbative solution is obtained.Fields with values in a Riemann surface are discussed in brief.</TEXT></DOC>
