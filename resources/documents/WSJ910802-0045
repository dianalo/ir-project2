Sponsors Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Edward Markey (D.,Mass.) shepherded similar legislation through the House lastyear as part of a crime bill. But the measure was strippedfrom the bill during conference after business groupsobjected to a section that would have required auditors to becertain that internal controls were sufficient to determinefraud. This year's version has toned down that section, citedas too costly, to require an SEC study of such controls.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would require auditors who suspect wrongdoing toreport the findings to the company's management, which isthen responsible for informing the SEC within one day. If thecompany doesn't inform the SEC in time, the auditor mustresign and send a copy of the findings to the agency.   In addition, the new version of the bill would give theSEC new muscle to request auditors' reports &quot;on any matterwhich the commission may deem necessary or appropriate forthe protection of investors.&quot; That provision, put in place inreaction to the unfolding scandal at Bank of Credit andamp;Commerce International, could be a powerful new tool for theSEC.</TEXT></DOC>
