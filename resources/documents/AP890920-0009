(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp was jeeredduring a visit to a soup kitchen Tuesday before he gave a speechpledging to speed up government aid to the homeless.   Kemp offered few specifics during an impassioned talk to a groupof federal officials and portrayed the fight against homelessness aspart of a wider battle against poverty and despair.   ``There are people in this country who are hurting. Those thathave been blessed have an obligation to be a blessing to someoneelse,'' Kemp said.   Discussing the federal government's contribution to endinghomelessness, the secretary of the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment said, ``Is it enough? No. Are we going to do more? Yes.''   Meanwhile, in an interview with the New York Times, Kemp proposedways to rid the troubled agency of influence-peddling. He said hewould seek to base the awarding of HUD subsidies on merit ratherthan on the discretion of department officials, and to require thatconsultants register their fees.   ``I'm not chairman of the Republican National Committee,'' Kempsaid. Funding decisions ``will be based on objective criteria,competition, merit, and need, not who you know or what your partyis,'' he said.   Under Kemp's predecessor, Samuel Pierce, HUD officials steeredhousing subsidies to developers who had hired politically connectedRepublican consultants.   Kemp said he would propose a mix of administrative, regulatory,and legislative measures, as well as making all financing decisionspublic.   In Hartford, many of those eating at the St. Elizabeth's Housesoup kitchen, where Kemp stopped before his speech, doubted Kemp'swords would result in action.   ``Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush. It's always thesame thing. It's just another name and we never get anything,'' saida homeless woman who jeered the secretary during his visit to thedining room crowded with about 100 people.   The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was angered thatKemp chose the soup kitchen as a backdrop for a photo opportunity.   ``I don't feel that they should come in here with their jacketsand ties on to have their pictures taken with homeless men, womenand children. Nobody asked our permission. It's humiliating,degrading and total exploitation,'' she said.   Kemp was surrounded by reporters and photographers in the doorwayof the soup kitchen, and never made it inside the room.   Kemp's visit to Hartford began with a tour of a homeless shelterthat was empty for the day and ended with a pep talk to theInteragency Council on the Homeless, where he announced arent-subsidy grant program.   ``President Bush wants an all-out effort to wage war onhomelessness and despair, on drugs and poverty, and I plan to be aleader in that fight,'' Kemp said.   Kemp's speech gave an outline for what he termed the ``firststeps'' in the effort to end homelessness. The secretary called forimproved coordination among federal, state and local officials andnon-profit organizations aiding the homeless.   He also said the government would cut through red tape and makeit easier for homeless people and those who provide for them toreceive government help.   Kemp announced a joint venture between HUD and a philanthropicgroup, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to create as many as1,200 housing units in eight cities. HUD will provide rent subsidiesworth about $36 million over five years and $2.4 million infoundation grants will be used for support services.   Kemp conceded that government procedures have resulted in a poorrecord for helping the homeless. He said that since 1983 only 293homes have been leased and 183 sold to organizations helping thehomeless.   Kemp said HUD has 49,200 houses available at a 10 percentdiscount for purchase by non-profit organizations that can pay cashat closing. In the past, he said, eligibility for such sales werelimited to tax-supported entitities, shutting out charitable groupsthat had no funding from the government.   Such groups now will be able to receive the same benefits, hesaid.   Kemp said help provided by his department will be part of abroader anti-poverty strategy with the Department of Health andHuman Services.   ``We will pool our resources and our ingenuity,'' he said in hisprepared remarks. ``If it requires waivers, we'll grant waivers. Ifit requires new legislation, we'll propose it ... And if our effortsrequire new money, I'll ask for it,'' the HUD secretary said.</TEXT></DOC>
