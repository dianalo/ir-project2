An importantH/sup +/ ion signal is observed with two types of target: polar moleculesand molecules with a high degree of electronic affinity. For each process,the variation of the collision as a function kinetic energy, and theabsolute value of the total ionization cross section in the thermal domain(20-500MeV) are measured. The results cannot be interpreted within theframework of the free electron model. This model reduces the interactionsin the system concerned to simply the interaction of the Rydberg electronwith the molecule, which is treated by dipolar Born approximation. Calculationsbased on a less restrictive approach to the interactions confirm theimportance of rotational transitions at several quanta previously neglected.</TEXT></DOC>
