Instrumental in the motion's defeat was the role of several Latin American nations that, in the past, may have abstained from such a vote but never would have voted against the U.S. The Miami Herald suggested in an editorial that Cuba may have used outright threats against Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela in order to persuade those countries to vote against Washington and in favor of Havana.    The Miami Herald's editorial ended with a conventionally virtuous conclusion that if the Latin American countries that bent under Cuban threats had weighted their national interests better, they ought to have concluded that appeasing Cuba is an even greater menace to their sovereignty and their democratic values. For my part, I think that the charade in Geneva, if properly deciphered, yields a more complicated and far grimmer message.    There was a time when only Mexico was ready to appease and accommodate Fidel Castro's Cuba. My country, Venezuela, not only broke diplomatic relations early with Havana, but having suffered Cuban-instigated terrorism in the 1960s, spearheaded the move to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.    In the intervening years, nearly every Latin American country has had to come to terms with the fact that the U.S. in 1961 (after the Bay of Pigs fiasco) and finally in 1962 (at the time of the Cuban missile crisis), conceded Cuba's client-state status with its global adversary, the Soviet Union. Zbigniew Brzezinski, in his book &quot;Game Plan,&quot; described this development as revealing &quot;an extraordinary degree of cowardice and strategic shortsightedness on the part of American decision makers,&quot; bound to lead to incremental losses in the Western Hemisphere for the U.S., and to corresponding gains for the Soviet Union. However, this consequence did not become apparent right away.    Although Fidel Castro tried to export his revolution -- with no encouragement at that time from the wary Soviets, who still could not believe that the U.S. would not react -- the very fact of Cuba's continuous economic failures and relentless repression strengthened Latin America's resolve to avoid the &quot;Cuban model.&quot; Every institution (except the universities) resisted Mr. Castro's attempts at subversion: the armies, all non-communist political parties, the church, the labor unions, media and business communities. In general, all elements of society had been forewarned, were on the alert and were ready to fight communism.    Everyone -- including the would-be revolutionaries -- still firmly believed that, come what may, the U.S. would not fail to live up to its responsibility as protector of the Western Hemisphere. This was not out of any altruistic concern for Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica or Venezuela. Latin Americans simply believed that the U.S. would not slip in defense of its most obvious strategic interests, bound to be respected by the Soviet Union in the same way that the Soviets' vital strategic interests were respected by the U.S. when the Hungarians revolted in 1956.    This began to change after the 1962 missile crisis, when no one could fail to perceive that in all essential matters the U.S. had capitulated with regard to Soviet control of Cuba. Not too long after that disaster, the Soviet Union began to build up Cuba militarily with the intention of using it as a surrogate power in conventional warfare, in such places as Angola. And from at least 1968, the Soviets began using Cuba as a training ground for terrorists, vastly increasing its potential for regional subversion. Mr. Castro used this new &quot;military technique&quot; in preparing Latin America for &quot;new Cubas,&quot; which duly happened within a few years in Nicaragua.    The fact that the U.S. may now have resigned itself to accept a communist Nicaragua, as it grew to accept a communist Cuba 25 years earlier, has at last persuaded Latin Americans to accept a truly catastrophic shift in the regional balance of power. All the more so since the kind of power that Cuba can and does wield in the hemisphere does not rest chiefly on its disproportionate military forces (although those forces also may, at times, be brought to bear). Conventional warfare is a blunt weapon in the nuclear age, as we have all come to realize; the time is past when the threat of invasion proves to be the primary method by which stronger, more resolute nations induce weaker or irresolute ones to yield. As apparently just happened in Geneva, Cuba can simply threaten to administer varying doses of terrorism: a few (or a few more) kidnappings, assassinations, bombs, more help to drug barons disguised as freedom fighters and so on.    The risk that such pressure can be administered with impunity has increased exponentially as the U.S. again has proved ineffectual in its half-hearted attempts to prevent the consolidation of a Havana-Managua axis. Seen under this light, the defeated U.S. motion in Geneva appears as an exercise in futility -- an almost wanton test of its clients' allegiance by an incompetent imperial power.    ---   Mr. Rangel is a Venezuelan author.
