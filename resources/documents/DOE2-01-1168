The magnetic material is suitablyin the form of particles distributed in a flexible support member, forexample a ferrofluid within plastics ducts in a soft textile fabric.By obtaining signals only from a specific region, the resolution withinthat region may be increased without extending the imaging time or producingaliasing, e.g. using a two dimensional Fourier transform technique.</TEXT></DOC>
