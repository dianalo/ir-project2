Actionon the principal subject of this rulemaking, adoption of breakaway requirementsfor highway sign, luminaire, and traffic signal supports, began with anotice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), FHWA Docket 86-17, (51 FR 40817,November 10, 1986), which presented FHWA's proposal to adopt, for applicationon Federal-aid highway projects, revised specifications for structuralsupports for highway signs, luminaires, and traffic signals. Subsequently,a final rule, FHWA Docket 86-17, Notice 2, (52 FR 36245, September 28,1987), adopted, for use on Federal-aid highway projects, the AASHTO ``StandardSpecifications for Highway Signals, Luminaires and Traffic Signals, 1985'',as amended by the ``1986 Interim Revisions,'' except for the requirementsof Section 7 of the document, which deal with breakaway supports. At thattime FHWA held in abeyance the adoption of Section 7 of the cited 1985specifications, pending completion and evaluation of capability testingof previously accepted breakaway luminaire supports. In the interim FHWAhas continued to accept, for use on Federal-aid highway projects, breakawaysupports conforming to the requirements contained in Section 7 of the ``StandardSpecifications for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires andTraffic Signals, 1975.'' In proceeding with development of a revised rule on breakaway supports,FHWA issued a summary of the results obtained from its capability testingof luminaire supports and announced an extension of the comment periodon the proposed adoption of Section 7 of the 1985 AASHTO specifications,FHWA Docket 86-17, Notice 3, (52 FR 47403, December 14, 1987). The extendedcomment period ended March 14, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>There were 14 commenters on the NPRM prior to publication of the luminairesupport test results and extension of the comment period. Eleven of thecommenters to the NPRM, including 3 State Highway Agencies (SHA's), 6 manufacturers,a safety advocacy group, and a lighting industry group, specifically addressedthe provisions of Section 7. Three commenters (one SHA and two manufacturers) recommended that FHWAadopt the 1985 revision of Section 7. The safety advocacy group recommendedthat the standard be revised to include cars smaller than 1800 pounds,to require a lower change in velocity, and to establish a compliance datefor retrofit. Six commenters (two SHA's, two manufacturers, the safetyadvocacy group, and the industry group) recommended that devices that aredesigned to meet the new breakaway criteria be studied to assure that theymeet the needs for strength and durability under field conditions. Threecommenters (one SHA and two manufacturers) stressed the need for new hardwareto be studied to assure that devices meeting the new criteria are feasible.Two commenters (one manufacturer and the industry group) expressed concernabout the test facility that was being used to evaluate the breakaway devices.The industry group and one SHA recommended that Section 7 remain as itwas under the 1975 specifications. Three commenters (two manufacturersand the industry group) opposed the four-inch stub height requirement inthe 1985 revision of Section 7 as being too restrictive.There were 24 commenters on the NPRM subsequent to the December 14, 1987,publication of supplemental information and extension of the comment period.Comments were received from twelve SHA's, three safety advocacy groups,seven manufacturers, and two industry groups.Eight commenters (five SHA's, two manufacturers, and one industry group)recommended that more research be conducted to develop breakaway devicesthat meet the proposed criteria and still provide adequate structural strengthand durability. Six commenters (two SHA's and four manufacturers) notedthat none of the aluminum transformer bases tested met the proposed criteria.(The SHA's were concerned that they would be left without an acceptablebreakaway device since they had four other reasons for curtailing use ofother breakaway devices.) Six commenters (four SHA's, one manufacturer,and one industry group) believed that the four-inch stub height requirementwas unnecessarily restrictive, especially when typical roadside gradingwas considered. Five commenters (two SHA's and three manufacturers) wereconcerned that hardware that met the proposed criteria would not be ableto withstand loadings to be expected during their design lives of 20 to30 years. Seven commenters (four SHA's and three manufacturers) expressedthe opinion that the slip bases that passed the impact tests relied heavilyon proper installation and maintenance, including bolt torquing and properorientation, control of corrosion, and removal of ice and snow accumulations,thus, they questioned the long term performance of slip bases. Four commenters(three manufacturers and one industry group) expressed concern over thereliability of testing performed on breakaway devices. Three commenters(all SHA's) requested that an extended implementation period be grantedin order that new hardware could be developed. Three commenters (two manufacturersand one industry group) stated that the good in-service record of aluminumtransformer bases should be evidence that the proposed Section 7 revisionsare unwarranted. Three commenters (two SHA's and one industry group) areconcerned that the proposed standards would expose owners and manufacturersto greater legal liability (no further explanations were given). Threecommenters (two manufacturers and one industry group) disputed the statementin the NPRM that, ``the manufacturers of structural support materials maybe minimally affected by the Revised Specifications.'' They believe thatthe costs to design, test, and produce hardware meeting the proposed specificationwould be significant.Three commenters (two safety advocacy groups and one manufacturer) recommendedthat Section 7 be adopted promptly. The third safety advocacy group requestedthat the breakaway criteria for vehicle size and change in velocity bemade more demanding. Five commenters (two industry support groups, twomanufacturers, and one SHA) requested that the 1985 Section 7 be withdrawnentirely and the 1975 version retained. A total of two commenters discussed each of the following topics: vehiclesize trends, the criteria for change in velocity during impact tests, theneed to redesign transformer base bolt circles, restrictions on proprietarycouplings and shear bases, and lack of couplings for bolt sizes other thanone inch. (Topics by single commenters are not summarized here. However,some are covered in the responses to comments below.) Overall, responses on Section 7 were received from 30 different commenters,(13 SHA's 3 safety advocacy groups, 12 manufacturers, and 2 industry groups).The three safety advocacy groups, three manufacturers, and one SHA urgedadoption of the 1985 Section 7 as written or favored more restrictive criteria.These commenters believe that the smaller test vehicle is necessary tomore accurately represent those small cars that are now becoming a significantportion of the highway traffic. The SHA's and manufacturers who opposed adoption of the 1985 Section 7based their opposition on a belief that hardware meeting the new criteriawould take a significant investment in time and money to develop and thatadoption of the revised Section 7 would result in a significant numberof support devices that have not been field tested for fatigue strength,corrosion resistance, reliability of breakaway characteristics, etc. Theyalso suggested that luminaire supports meeting the new requirements maynot be suitable for the greater heights and bracket arm lengths currentlyused, resulting in more luminaires and luminaire supports being neededto provide the same lighting intensity on the roadway. <ITAG tagnum="84">Acceptance Criteria </ITAG>Some reviewers suggested that the acceptance criteria are excessivly demanding,citing a lack of documentation of poor performance with breakaway hardwarenominally conforming to the 1975 AASHTO requirements. Most of the accident``data'' cited to demonstrate that no problem exists are poorly documented.Valid, detailed, and statistically significant accident data on the performanceof highway safety hardware are not available. Thus, in order to proceedwith improving highway safety, judgments must be made using available information.Considering the number and impact performance of existing breakaway supports,the mix of highway vehicles, and likely distribution of impact conditions,one would not expect to find many fatal accidents involving existing breakawaysupports. This is the result intended by using such supports. On the otherhand, laboratory experience and analysis strongly suggest that impactsby the smaller automobiles on supports in the upper range of acceptabilityunder the 1975 AASHTO requirements are likley to cause a significant numberof injuries, some rather serious. The requirements being adopted with thisfinal rule should appreciably reduce the potential for serious injury underthese marginal impact conditions. Some who responded to the NPRM asked why the 15-fps occupant impact velocitylimitation proposed in NCHRP Report 230 and contained in the 1985 AASHTOspecification for breakaway supports was so much lower than the 30-fpslimit proposed in Report 230 for other safety appurtenances such as crashcushions. Vehicle contact with virtually all roadside obstructions createssome level of risk for vehicle occupants. The goal in designing roadsideappurtenances is to reduce this risk to its lowest practicable level. Thephysical limitations on designs for breakaway supports for roadside signs,luminaires, and traffic signals are vastly different from those on longitudinalbarriers and crash cushions, where the systems must stop or redirect awide range of vehicles. For breakaway supports the principal structuralrequirement that must be met is resistance to wind loads. For the largestsign and luminaire supports on our highways the shear requirements at theirbases would rarely, if ever, exceed 9,000 pounds, and for most supportsthe requirements will be far less. Thus, theoretically, even the most massivesupports likely to be accepted could safely be designed to breakaway underlateral forces much less than those that would produce the maximum allowableoccupant impact velocity. While the writers of Report 230 were lookingmore to the historical acceptance of the requirements in the 1975 AASHTOspecifications and the availability of conforming breakaway supports whenthey made their recommendations, the physical reality is that their recommendationsare more than achievable and supports meeting the Report 230 requirements,when tested with 1800-pound vehicles, are available and being used. Thus,the only potential argument against their adoption appears to be cost.Those respondents to the NPRM, primarily suppliers, who questioned thecost of the new requirements cited development, testing, and retoolingcosts. In anticipation of adoption of the new requirements several companieshave proceeded with the development and testing of supports to meet therequirements, some have reported development of hardware that meets thenew requirements. One of the reported conforming hardware items is an aluminumbreakaway transformer base (with three variations) for luminaire supports,an item several respondents indicated would not be available if the newrequirements were adopted. Some hardware types already available at the time the AASHTO adopted its1985 specifications met its requirements and are sufficient to meet nearlyall site requirements. Also, some suppliers have already started investingin development to bring their products in line with the new requirements.Therefore, FHWA does not expect the costs to be nearly as great as estimatedby the manufacturers. It seems likely that applying the new requirementsto future construction will be justified by the improved benefits to thepublic. However, given the relatively good performance experienced with supportsmeeting the 1975 AASHTO breakaway requirements, it would rarely be costbeneficial to replace or retrofit an existing serviceable support acceptedunder the 1975 requirements. Nevertheless, the FHWA will continue its longstanding policy of encouraging highway agencies to replace damaged supportswith those meeting current requirements whenever practicable.  There is a stub height requirements in the 1985 AASHTO specification thatis new. Some of the respondents to the NPRM questioned the need for thisrequirement or suggested that it is too restrictive. The objective of therequirement is to prevent vehicle undercarriage snagging. Without thislimiting requirements, designs and support placements have occasionallyemerged that are obviously unsafe. Thus, FHWA believes avoidance of undercarriagesnagging needs to be addressed by the requirements for breakaway design.Foundations with skid plates or blocks to cause vehicles to pass over baseremains could be used to achieve the objective of the stub height requirement.In its interpretation and application of the stub height requirement FHWAwill examine the intent of the requirement and will work with the AASHTOto determine whether more objective criteria for defining stub height andalternative means of preventing undercarriage snagging can be incorporatedin its specification.  Increased maintenance problems and hazards from unexpected collapse ofsupports were suggested by some respondents. The FHWA does not see theseas likely problems. First of all, there are supports of proven strengthto fill nearly all service requirements. Secondly, new designs will berequired to meet the structural requirements of the AASHTO specifications,which, if properly applied, will prevent supports of poor performance fromentering service.  Testing procedures were questioned by some respondents. The capabilitytesting of luminaire supports undertaken by the FHWA followed an extensiveperiod of development of the FHWA's Federal Outdoor Impact Laboratory (FOIL)at the Federal Highway Research Center in McLean, Virginia. A four-wheelcart (bogie) with a replaceable, crushable aluminum honeycomb nose wasdeveloped and used at the FOIL as a surrogate for automobiles in all theluminaire support capability testing. The bogie noses (there are three,one each for 20-, 40-, and 60-mph tests) were configured to approximatelyreplicate the crush characteristics of a 1979 Volkswagen Rabbit when striking,head on, a narrow object at a point 14 inches left of its centerline. Thesecrush characteristics were selected after examining the crush characteristicsof several other vehicles and other impact locations. The selected crushcharacteristics are not those that might be expected to place the mostdemanding requirements on breakaway hardware. However, FHWA believes themto be representative of the crush charactistics of large portion of today'ssmall automobiles and close to those that would be most demanding. TheFHWA has high confidence in the bogie tester and, for 20-mph tests, hashigh confidence in pendulum testers fitted with an impact nose duplicatingthe 20-mph nose used on the bogie.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interpretation, Evaluation, and Implementation  </ITAG>After evaluating all the responses to the NPRM and the results from thecapability testing of breakaway luminaire supports and considering thehistorical and technical bases of requirements for breakaway supports,the FHWA concludes that Section 7 of the AASHTO's Standard Specificationsof Strucutural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires and Traffic Signals,1985,'' contains suitable requirements upon which to base acceptance ofbreakaway supports for use on Federal-aid highway projects. However, wherethe AASHTO specification requires that a breakaway support not cause achange in velocity greater than 15 fps in the test device, the FHWA willaccept a change in velocity of 16 fps. Additionally, the FHWA will establisha transition period during which break- away supports previously foundacceptable under the AASHTO's 1975 breakaway requirements may continueto be installed on Federal-aid highway projects until July 1, 1990. Afterthis time all new breakaway sign, luminaire, and traffic signals supportsinstalled on Federal-aid highway projects will be required to meet thebreakaway requirements in the 1985 AASHTO specifications as amended bythe ``1988 Interim Revisions'', with the modification, as stated above,that the maximum change in velocity allowable will be 16 fps.  Establishing July 1, 1990, as the date for full compliance with the breakawayrequirements being adopted with this final rule is intended to allow sufficienttime for breakaway support manufacturers to take those steps needed toproduce and qualify durable products meeting the new requirements and toallow highway agencies sufficient to to revise their specifications, designpractices, and project plans to conform to the new requirements.  The decision by the FHWA to accept an occupant impact velocity of 16 fpsrather than the 15 fps suggested in NCHRP Report 230 and specified in the1985 AASHTO specifications is based on the fact that the 1975 AASHTO specificationshad an implicit acceptance level of 15.7 fps, which when rounded the nearestwhole number is 16 fps. The FHWA believes this value will result in safebreakaway support designs and that it is consistent with the current state-of-the-artin breakaway support design.The FHWA has no plans, and does not believe it would be in the public interest,to require that breakaway supports previously found acceptable and installedunder the 1975 AASHTO specifications be retrofitted or replaced on anyFederal-aid highway projects, unless accident experience dictates suchaction. However, the FHWA will encourage highway agencies to adopt thenew breakaway requirements before the conversion deadline and, to the extentpracticable after conversion to the new breakaway requirements, to replacedamaged breakaway supports with supports meeting the new requirements.The FHWA has observed that certain installation and testing practices havean influence on test results. Thus, in testing breakaway supports and interpretingand applying test results it will be strongly recommended that:andbullet; Where standardized testing devices (bogies, pendulums, etc.) areavailable, they should be used for acceptance testing.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_There are limitations on use of the bogie and the pendulum.Neither is suitable for testing base-bending supports and the pendulumis not suitable for testing breakaway supports that require approximately12 inches or more of movement to effect complete separation between theirupper portions and their foundations. The advantage of testing with a standardbogie or a pendulum, beyond the very considerable savings in testing cost,is the consistent response of the test device.</ITAG>andbullet; All fasteners likely to have an influence on the breakaway performanceof a support being tested should be of the type to be used in service installationsor a procedure should be established to assure that the effect of the fastenersused in testing will be the same as that of the fasteners actually to beused for in-service installations. (It may be appropriate to use specialstrain measuring bolts in test installations in order to precisely measureand control clamping forces.)andbullet; Estimates of torque values required in the bolts to be used forin-service installations to achieve the same bolt clamping forces as usedin testing should be obtained and made a part of the test report. (If non-servicebolts are used in testing there should be instructions for installing servicebolts to duplicate, in the service installations, the same bolt effectsthat were obtained in testing.)andbullet; Where the manufacturer specifies bolt torques to be used withthe bolts recommended for use with a breakaway support, the clamping forceproduced in the recommended bolt under the specified torque should be determined,reported, and the recommended practices followed in the test installation.andbullet; Where the manufacturer or user does not specify a bolt clampingforce or bolt torque, state-of-the-practice procedures should be followedand reported. In the absence of such procedures, a clamping force thatis equivalent to that which would be achieved by subjecting the bolt specifiedby the manufacturer to a tightening torque of 200 foot pounds should beused in test installations. (In the absence of a recommendation by themanufacturer or user for a bolt or bolt finish, a bolt of the type andfinish most likely to be used should be used and its type and finish reported.)andbullet; Information describing critical clamping forces and/or bolt torquesand any other critical installation practices should be supplied with eachbreakaway support and, preferably, be permanently marked on the support.andbullet; When testing transformer bases, the maximum bolt circle recommendedby the manufacturer for use with the base should be used in testing thebase.andbullet; The weight of that portion of a breakaway support that might fallon the roof of a vehicle should not exceed 1,000 pounds. (The weight ofa sign panel would normally not be included as a part of the weight ofa support.)andbullet; The words ``* * * maximum change in velocity for a standard 1800-pound(816.5 kg) vehicle * * *'' in the AASHTO specifications should be interpretedas also meaning ``* * * maximum occupant impact velocity, as determinedby the procedures in NCHRP Report 230, in a test with an 1800-pound (816.5kg) vehicle * * *'' (The commentary on Section 7 in the 1985 specificationsmakes it clear that this is the intent of the specifications.)This final rule also covers the FHWA's adoption of AASHTO's 1987 and 1988revisions to its 1985 sign and luminaire support specifications. Only oneof those revisions touches on a potential safety issue. That is a changein Section 7 that would reduce from eight feet to seven feet the minimumclear distance supports must be apart in multiple support signs to be consideredas acting independently. The FHWA has no evidence that this change willhave more than a very minimal impact on safety. All other changes containedin the 1987 and 1988 Interim Revisions are either editorial or are consideredby the FHWA to have no potential for adversely impacting the safety, durability,or cost of sign supports. Therefore, it accepts all the changes in the1985 AASHTO specifications contained in the 1987 and 1988 Interim Revisions.Additionally, these final amendments are intended to bring Part 625 upto date with versions of the cited publications or new publications alreadyformally or informally recognized by the FHWA as appropriate bases forthe design of highways.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation and Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291 or a significant regulation under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. With due considerationgiven to: Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation (on file in FHWA Docket 86-17);capability testing of luminaire supports conducted by FHWA (summary reportcontained in FHWA Docket 86-17, Notice 3 (52 FR 47403) December 14, 1987);comments received in response to the notices of proposed rulemaking; informationdescribed in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this document;and the information reported below, the FHWA concludes that this rule willsufficiently improve highway safety to justify the relatively small additionalcost its implementation may require. An important factor considered in developing this rule was an implied promiseto the public to provide a given level of breakaway performance. The 1975AASHTO specifications have an implied maximum change in velocity requirementof 15.7 fps for a 2250-pound vehicle. In late 1973, when the 1975 breakawayspecification was being developed, automobiles were, on average, considerablylarger and heavier than they are today. At that time the 2250-pound automobilewas not the smallest automobile on our highways, but the judgment was madethat, since vehicles in that weight class were readily available for useas test vehicles and there were very few smaller vehicles on our highways,the 2250-pound automobile was a reasonable choice as a test vehicle. Also,given the relatively low allowable change in velocity value in the specification,there was a high probability that conforming breakaway supports would bebroken away in 20-mph frontal impacts by the smallest automobiles thanon our highways, albeit at higher changes in velocity than prescribed inthe specification. A very significant reduction in automobile weights has occurred since 1973.FHWA's interest in breakaway requirements relative to the smaller vehiclesentering the fleet was made explicit in 1979, when it announced that FHWAsponsored research would consider mini-sized cars (1700 to 1800 pounds).In 1981 the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) issuedNCHRP Report 230, ``Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluationof Highway Appurtenances.'' This report contained guidance for testingbreakaway supports with 1800-pound vehicles and suggested a maximum allowablechange in velocity of 15 fps in the test vehicle. In March of 1983, AASHTObegan the process of examining the test vehicle for breakaway supports.This ultimately led to adoption of the breakaway requirements now foundin section 7 of the AASHTO's 1985 specifications, which call for testingwith an 1800-pound vehicle. The 1800-pound vehicle holds about the same relative position in the rangeof vehicles in the fleet today as the 2250-pound vehicle held in the fleetin 1973_there are few smaller than the 1800-pound vehicle. Additionally,breakaway supports conforming to the requirements being adopted with thisrule are likely to breakaway under 20-mph frontal impacts by the smallestautomobiles currently being marketed in this country. Thus, the requirementsbeing adopted with this rule approximately establish the same relativelevel of safety performance for breakaway supports for signs, luminaires,and traffic signal's for today's traffic as the 1975 AASHTO breakaway requirementsdid for the traffic at the time they were first proposed. There are three logical questions to be asked about this rule: Is it sufficient?Is it achievable?Is it worth the cost?The answer to the first question is, in part, dependent on the answer tothe other two questions. Striking any object creates some risk. What measuresare appropriate to reduce that risk depend on available technology, cost,and the level of the risk. The 16-fps occupant impact velocity performancecriterion for the breakaway supports covered by this notice is essentiallythe same acceptance criterion relative to an 1800-pound vehicle, as hasexisted since 1975 relative to a 2250-pound vehicle. An occupant impactvelocity of 16 fps is not likely to produce serious injury. However, thiscriterion is not as conservative as it may appear. The impulse that willproduce such an occupant impact velocity in an 1800-pound vehicle in ahigh speed impact is close to the level that, if applied eccentricallyto the vehicle, would cause the vehicle to yaw to the extent rollover wouldbe likely. Additionally, for impact speeds above, and for some level below,the specified maximum and minimum test speeds, respectively, the occupantimpact speeds will be higher than those seen at both limits of the testspeed range. There is also the possibility that a vehicle interior or anoccupant position or condition could lead to serious injury even at thelow specified allowable occupant impact velocity. For the few vehicleson our highways that are lighter than the specified test vehicle, thereis the probability of occupant impact velocities higher than the specifiedmaximum. In summary, adoption of the acceptance criterion for breakaway supportsfor luminaires, signs, and traffic signals that limits the maximum occupantimpact velocity to 16 fps in an 1800-pound test vehicle under impacts atspeeds between 20 and 60 mph provides the same level of protection fortoday's traffic that the 1975 AASHTO breakaway requirements provided fortraffic of the mid-1970's. It ensures a very low probability of seriousinjury for occupants of vehicles striking conforming supports, providedthe impact conditions are no more demanding than those specified for acceptancetesting. It also ensures a very low probability of life-threatening injuryfor virtually all potential impacts, except for those that result in anoccupant striking a support directly. The principal source of opposition to FHWA's adoption of the new breakawayrequirements came from suppliers of aluminum lighting pole products. Acast aluminum transformer base is the breakaway device in most aluminumbreakaway luminaire supports. In the capability testing of breakaway luminairesupports conducted by FHWA a large proportion of the transformer base equippedsupports failed to meet the new breakaway requirements. Without acceptabletransformer bases, the aluminum pole manufacturers face the possibilityof losing a large part of their share of the breakaway luminaire supportmarket. However, there are other breakaway mechanisms that can be usedwith aluminum supports. One aluminum pole manufacturer has presented datafrom crash tests of a breakaway shoe-base design that show the design meetsthe proposed FHWA requirements. A fastener manufacturer has an anchor boltcoupling under development that has passed the new breakaway requirementswhen crash tested. And, theoretically, slip-base technology, which is nowavailable for steel luminaire supports, could be adapted for use with aluminumpoles. Thus, the aluminum pole manufacturers are not dependent on transformerbases to provide breakaway supports. On the other hand, there is no theoreticalbar to the development of an acceptable breakaway aluminum transformerbase. In fact, one manufacturer has developed three transformer base modelsthat meet the new breakaway requirements. FHWA understands that the aluminum breakaway luminaire supports that arecurrently available to meet the new requirements probably do not coverthe full range of service requirements likely to be encountered. It alsounderstands that further development and tooling costs will be requiredof the aluminum pole manufacturers to provide conforming breakaway supportsthat also meet the most demanding service requirements. Nevertheless, thereare breakaway support designs meeting the new requirements available tocover the full range of service requirements likely to be encountered.Thus, given the reduction in the sizes of vehicles on our highways, thelaboratory evidence that 1800-pound vehicles failed, in 20-mph tests, tobreakaway some supports accepted under the old breakaway requirements,and the availability of supports meeting the new breakaway requirements,the FHWA can find no basis for not imposing the new breakaway requirements. In setting July 1, 1990, as the date for full compliance with the new requirements,FHWA gave consideration to the safety of the motoring public, the timesome highway agencies will need to revise their breakaway support designsand specifications, and development work underway by support suppliersthat is likely to result in replacement products for those supports renderedunacceptable by the new requirements. Since the supports installed in thetransition period will, at a minimum, have to have been found acceptableunder the old breakaway requirements and there will be only a limited numberof supports not meeting the new requirements installed in the transitionperiod, the FHWA believes any benefits the public might gain from an immediateimposition of the new requirements will be offset by increased costs owingto disruption of highway agencies' current practices and of their possiblyunnecessarily having to select designs that are incompatible with theircurrent practices. These costs are likely to be avoided if the supportsuppliers can finish development of compatible substitutions for theirold designs in the time allowed for compliance. The FHWA recognizes thatthere is no assurance that this will happen. But, given the efforts alreadyexpended by the suppliers and the technical feasibility of developing supportsto meet the new requirements, the FHWA believes there is a high probabilitythat, when the suppliers are given a definite date when compliance willbe required, they will meet the challenge.  The FHWA believes that this action will have a minimal regulatory impact.Title 23, U.S.C. section 109. Standards, requires that:  <ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The Secretary shall not approve plans and specifications for proposedprojects on any Federal-aid system if they fail to provide for a facility(1) that will adequately meet the existing and probable future trafficneeds and conditions in a manner conducive to safety, durability, and economyof maintenance; (2) that will be designed and constructed in accordancewith standards best suited to accomplish the foregoing objectives and toconform to the particular needs of each locality.  </ITAG>Part 625 of Title 23, CFR, is the instrument by which the FHWA, actingfor the Secretary of Transportation, informs State highway agencies ofthe bases upon which highway projects will be evaluated for compliancewith the statutory design requirements. The principal element of this rulerevises FHWA's requirements for the design of breakaway supports for highwaysigns, luminaires, and traffic signals. The remaining elements of the rulebring the guidance in Part 625 up to date with currently accepted designpractices.  Since some breakaway supports meeting the new requirements promulgatedby this rule are already being installed by highway agencies, the FHWAdoes not believe this rule will impose a significant, if any, cost burdenon the States. However, individual highway agencies may have to adopt somenew designs because certain of their current designs do not meet the newbreakaway requirements. To mitigate problems this may cause affected highwayagencies, the FHWA is extending the compliance date to July 1, 1990, forhighway agencies to meet the new requirments. During this time the FHWAexpects that several breakaway support suppliers will redesign and qualifytheir products to meet the new requirements. The FHWA also expects thatmost of these new products will be compatible with the ones replaced, thus,further reducing the burden on highway agencies.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act and Federalism Assessment  </ITAG>Based on the discussion above and under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), the FHWA hereby certifies that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. The FHWA has carefully considered the federalism implicationsof this action in light of the principles, criteria, and requirements ofthe President's Executive Order on Federalism, E.O. 12612, October 26,1987. The FHWA has determined that this final rule does not have sufficientFederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
