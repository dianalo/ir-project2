The FCC originally proposed eliminating the network-cablecross-ownership rule in 1982, but never acted on the plan.   The rule was adopted in 1970, when the cable TV industry was inits infancy, because of fears that the TV networks would buy upcable systems and control their programming.   The FCC noted that a report by the Commerce Department'sNational Telecommunications Information and Administration in Junerecommended the rule be abolished. The report said the TV networks'influence has diminished significantly since the rule was adopted.   The agency's three sitting commissioners voted unanimously toseek comment again on the proposal to update the record so theagency can consider eliminating the rule. But one commissionerexpressed reservations.   Commissioner James H. Quello said he feared that without rulesrequiring cable systems to carry local broadcast signals, anetwork-owned cable system could disadvantage the local competitionby dropping the stations from its cable menu.   Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said he doubted that a network-ownedcable system would risk alienating viewers by dropping a popularchannel from its line-up. ``It would be an economic disincentive,''he said.   James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable TelevisionAssociation, said the commission's proposal to eliminate the ruleis ``reasonable'' because conditions have changed so much since1970.   The FCC also proposed scrapping a rule that limits the term ofaffiliation agreements between networks and stations to a maximumof two years.   This rule was adopted nearly 50 years ago for the radio industryand then applied to TV in 1945 as a way to assist new networks ingaining access to broadcast outlets.</TEXT></DOC>
