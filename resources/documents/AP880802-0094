(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National car rental companies andregional companies squared off over fees for fuel and mileage andcollision damage waivers at a conference intended to draft consumerguidelines for the industry.   Testimony by representatives of the car rental companies openeda four-day meeting of attorneys general from 17 states. A NationalAssociation of Attorneys General task force is hearing car rentalofficials respond to a preliminary report aimed at eliminatingmisleading and confusing advertising and marketing policies.   Regional companies, such as Alamo and General, advertise lowdaily rates with no additional charge for mileage. However, largercompanies, such as Hertz, complained that those companies don'talways advertise other charges, such as up-front fuel costs andairport fees.   Alamo and General responded Monday that Hertz and othercompanies haven't always advertised actual costs to consumers,particularly those who exceed mileage limits.   They contended that driving hundreds of miles above the limitscould triple the advertised rate and that some of the largercompanies charged a service fee of up to 1.75 times the local pumpprice to refill tanks with fuel.   The companies were also divided on collision damage waivers, anoptional charge that waives a customer's liability if the rentalcar is damaged.   Hertz, Thrifty, Budget and the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners all support laws eliminating the waiver, saying thatmost consumers have auto insurance that covers rental car accidents.   General and Alamo oppose attempts to eliminate collision damagewaivers.   Representatives of several rental companies said they generallysupport efforts to force their competitors to disclose more intheir advertising, as long as they all must do it.   ``Partial disclosure is more deceptive than no disclosure atall,'' said William E. Lobeck Jr., president of Thrifty Car Rentalof Tulsa, Okla.   Kansas Attorney General Bob Stephan is the chairman of the taskforce. Final recommendations will be presented to the associationat its national meeting in December.</TEXT></DOC>
