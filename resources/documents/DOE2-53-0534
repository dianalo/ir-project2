Microtextural parameters (longitudinal and transverseradius of curvature r/sub l/ and r/sub t/, diameter L/sub a/ and misorientationZ relative to the fiber axis of the carbon layer stacks), mechanicalproperties in traction of single filaments ({sigma}/sub c/, E, {epsilon}/subc/) and elemental analysis data (C, N) were determined. Microtextureis related to mechanical properties. The evolution of the tensile strengthof heat treated fibers depends on the nitrogen contain of the primarycarbon fiber and on the possibility for doing lateral bondings betweencarbon stacks. Heat treated carbon fibers at 2800/sup 0/C were comaparedto commercial high modulus ones.</TEXT></DOC>
