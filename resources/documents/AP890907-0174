Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., asked that the House IntelligenceCommittee begin ``a continuing investigation'' of new documents andother evidence that have surfaced in the trial of former Marine Lt.Col. Oliver North or which may surface during other upcoming trialsof Iran-Contra figures.   Congressional investigators in late 1987 concluded that topReagan administration officials had circumvented the law to sellarms to Iran and generate money to buy weapons for Nicaragua'sContra rebels. But the yearlong probe failed to fully pinpoint theextent of personal responsibility of Reagan, Bush and others.   ``Most importantly, we still do not understand precisely whatwere the roles in these events of President Reagan, Vice PresidentBush and other top Reagan administration officials,'' Hamilton saidin a letter to Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Anthony C.Beilenson, D-Calif.   ``Congress was charged with the responsibility to investigatethese events thoroughly and to understand them as best we could. Wewill have failed to discharge fully that responsibility if we leaveimportant evidence unexplored,'' Hamilton wrote.   ``In light of the importance of the questions that remain and theenormous implications of the events that have occurred, I do notbelieve we can consider the congressional investigation of theIran-Contra affair to be complete.''   Hamilton acknowledged that there is a certain weariness with thematter on Capitol Hill, but noted that each new effort to dig backinto the affair has shed new light.   He asked that as part of its continuing probe, the Intelligencepanel ask the Bush White House to undertake a comprehensive searchof all relevant Reagan administration files, including the ``headsof state'' file recently discovered at the Reagan Library inCalifornia.   ``It is possible that other important documents were missed byhave not yet come to light,'' Hamilton wrote.   He also asked that the committee evaluate the seven new documentsturned up at the North trial, which strongly suggested a Reaganadministration deal with the Honduran government under which theHondurans would help the Contras in return for increased U.S. aid.</TEXT></DOC>
