Twelve experiments are reported exploring the effectsof three factors: oxygen flow, partial pressure and mole fraction, eachfactor at two levels. The pressures used went up to 790 kPa, and theoxygen mole fraction to 35%. It was discovered that the oxygen partialpressure had no statistically significant effect. The oil recovery wasindependent of the factors used. The combustion time was dominated bythe oxygen flow, as were the reaction rates, while fuel and oxygen consumptiondepended mainly on the oxygen mole fraction. Increasing the oxygen molefraction reduced the consumption figures. The reaction stoichiometrywas substantially independent of the three factors. It was also foundthat the total pressure had no statistically significant effect on oilrecovery, combustion time, reaction rates, fuel consumption or stoichiometry.</TEXT></DOC>
