The issue was raised at a conference on in vitro _ or test tube_ fertilization attended by doctors from 42 nations. Another issuewas the morality of paying surrogates.   ``Surrogate parenting is a wonderful option for couples whocan't have children any other way, who have nowhere else to turn,''said William Handel, a lawyer from the Center for SurrogateParenting in Beverly Hills, Calif.   The center charges $15,000 to arrange contracts between couplesand surrogate mothers. However, the medical costs of in vitrofertilization could raise the total cost to $40,000, according tothe center, which has been involved in 11 such pregnancies.   More than 800 infants have been produced worldwide throughsurrogacy; usually the surrogate mother's eggs are used.   In the in vitro procedure, however, an embryo is produced in atest tube using the egg of a woman with a uterine defect, thenimplanted in the womb of the surrogate.   Dr. Wulf H. Utian, a member of the Cleveland team that producedthe world's first test tube baby using a surrogate in 1985, saidthe procedure ``raises numerous ethical issues.''   He cited questions over whether doctors should involvethemselves in contracting surrogates, whether the surrogate shouldbe paid, whether a surrogate should have a relationship with thechild she bears and who should be considered the baby's legalparents.   ``You cannot embark on a program of this nature without givingserious thought to these issues,'' said Utian, of Cleveland's Mt.Sinai Medical Center. ``Is it ethical, for example, for a Hollywoodactress to hire a surrogate so as not to have to take time out fromher career?''   Utian said his team has side-stepped the thornier ethicalquestions by dealing only with women who are infertile due to anabsent or non-functioning uterus because of a hysterectomy or acongenital defect.   Women in the Cleveland program provide their own surrogates, anddoctors are not involved in handling any financial arrangements. Inthe past 18 months, the team has achieved five pregnancies afterimplanting embryos in 25 surrogates, Utian said.   A program in Perth, Australia, uses only surrogates who areclose relatives, preferably sisters, of women who are unable tocarry a child because of uterine defects, said Dr. J.L. Yovich ofthe PIVET Medical Center.   The surrogates are not paid. Yovich said the clinic has achievedtwo pregnancies since last year.   Dr. Zev Rosenwaks of the Cornell Medical Center in New York said24 clinics in 10 countries, including the United States andAustralia, work with donated eggs.   The technique involves fertilizing the donor eggs with spermfrom an infertile woman's husband. Any resulting embryos are thenimplanted in the woman's uterus.   He said that in about 55 percent of the cases, eggs are providedby relatives of the infertile woman. The rest come from anonymousdonors or from test tube patients who have produced excess eggs asa result of hormone treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
