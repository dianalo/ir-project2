Treatments were: continuous infrared (CI),intermittent infrared (II; 4 min on, 2 min off, 10 cycles/h), and intermittentmicrowaves (IM; 2 min on, 4 min off, 10 cycles/h). At the conclusionof the 14-day experimental period the 21-day-old birds were killed. Althoughthere were significant differences (P less than or equal to .05) in meangain over the 2-wk treatment period between trials, no differences (Pgreater than .05) were attributed to treatments. There were, however,significant differences in feed:gain ratios between trials and betweentreatments. Feed:gain ratios of birds kept under CI and II treatmentsdid not differ significantly (P greater than .05). However, feed:gainratios, 1.61 +/- .04 and 1.57 +/- .04 for CI and II, respectively, differedsignificantly (P less than or equal to .05) from that of the IM treatment(1.76 +/- .04). The protein content of chicks under II was significantly(P less than or equal to .05) lower than that of birds under IM. Therewere no differences (P greater than .05) in fat, ash, calcium, and phosphoruscontent of chicks among treatments.</TEXT></DOC>
