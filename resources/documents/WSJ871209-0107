The U.S. is at an inherent strategic disadvantage, a fact the Soviets fully appreciate. A major goal of their policy has always been to make arms-control and disarmament discussions the only serious focus of U.S.-Soviet relations. They have successfully resisted any linkage between progress on arms control and progress in the areas of Soviet behavior that pose the greatest immediate strategic threat to American interests.    The Soviet war against the Afghan people continues, generating millions of refugees and pressure on Pakistan, a key strategic partner of the U.S. Similarly, Soviet backing sustains the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, which has created a prolonged refugee problem in neighboring Thailand. Through their military supplies and the presence of thousands of Cuban troops in Angola, the Soviets maintain their bid for prdominant influence in southern Africa. On the horn of Africa, a Soviet client regime in Ethiopia not only wages war against its own people, but provides support for rebel forces in southern Sudan. In Central America, massive Soviet assistance permits the Sandinista regime to resist democracy at home and support efforts to destabilize its neighbors, especially in El Salvador.    While the two sides jockey for positions in a war that may never be fought, the U.S. remains exposed to gradual defeat in the war that goes on every day. Because of the resistance to linkage, Soviet persistence in that war never becomes a central focus of serious U.S.-Soviet negotiations. The arms-control coinage that most interests the Soviets can never be cashed in for reductions in offensive Soviet behavior in the developing regions. The two sides reach bargains in which the U.S. pays in hard cash -- that is, results that can be converted into Soviet gains outside the arms-control area. In return, the U.S. receives nonconvertible currency -- that is, results that, at best, produce marginal advantages strictly limited to the arms-control area.    America's greatest postwar achievement is the reconstruction of Western Europe on a democratic basis. It failed, however, in its efforts to prevent the establishment of massively brutal, pro-Soviet tyrannies in other strategically significant regions. While the defeat in Vietnam is the principal symbol of that failure, its most dangerous consequences are felt much closer to home, in Central America.    The principal aim of Soviet policy in the postwar era has been to compensate for or overcome the effects of its strategic defeat in Western Europe. The main strategic necessity facing the U.S. has been to reverse the trend of failure in the other strategically significant regions of the world.    When the Vietnam debacle demoralized America's governing elite, the Soviets saw a chance to consolidate their military advantage in Europe. With their deployment of SS-20s against targets in Western Europe they sought to neutralize the tactical nuclear option needed to supplement NATO's inferior conventional defenses. They also sought to weaken security ties between Western Europe and the U.S. The Soviet leaders who made the deployment decision had good reason to believe there would be no effective U.S.-NATO response. They hoped to exploit America's post-Vietnam malaise to achieve a decisive psychological and political advantage in Europe, just as they had seized upon it to make important gains in Asia, southern Africa and Central America.    What the Brezhnev-era Soviet strategists did not anticipate was the election of a U.S. administration that had enough will, competence and domestic political support to frustrate the political component of their strategy. The Reagan administration successfully managed the politics of deploying Pershing 2s and cruise missiles in Europe. Soviet strategy suffered a major setback. Instead of leaving Europe open to Soviet attack without an automatic American response, the result left the Soviet Union open to attack from Europe without the automatic involvement of America's longrange nuclear arsenal.    The situation was not all bad for the Soviets. At best, they hoped to turn the SS-20s into bargaining chips with which to extract concessions from the West. At worst, there would be a return to the status quo ante, leaving increased European apprehensions about the reliability of America's nuclear umbrella and saddling NATO with the politically painful necessity of paying for expensive increases in conventional arms. It was a scenario that involved little pain for the Soviets, provided it left intact their gains in the developing world.    Since Lenin, Soviet leaders have understood that the resource-producing regions of the world are one key to influence in Europe. These areas provide minerals, raw materials and future trade relations far more important to Europe than to America. Africa and Asia are major suppliers to Europe of such minerals as copper, cobalt and aluminum, as well as a wide variety of raw materials including tea, coffee, cocoa, edible oils, spices, sisal and cotton. The Europeans are critically dependent on energy supplies from the Persian Gulf. If the Soviets could gain predominant influence in these regions, this would reinforce European inclinations toward cooperation with countries in the Soviet orbit. In addition, Soviet demonstrations of American incapacity in these areas could seriously damage Western cohesion and morale.    In the '70s the Soviets achieved major gains in Asia, Africa and Central America. They were effectively stymied only in the Middle East (though the U.S. suffered the loss of a major partner in the region when Ayatollah Khomeini emerged triumphant in Iran). When American leaders defeated the Soviet Union's SS-20 strategy, they had the opportunity to follow up their success in ways that helped to reverse the pro-Soviet trend.    The linkage principle articulated by the Reagan administration in its early days was the right basis for pursuing this goal. Given this principle, if the Soviets wanted to get out of the bad situation brought on by their bid for nuclear dominance in Europe, they would have to pay a price in terms of their position in the developing world. The key areas of interest lay in Afghanistan, Central America and southern Africa.    As long as the linkage idea held firm, the Soviets faced hard choices. They could accept the strategic disadvantage represented by NATO's deployment of intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe. Or, in exchange for restoration of the status quo before Soviet deployment of the SS-20s, they could negotiate some retrenchment of their position in the developing world.    The linkage principle meant holding back in areas of the U.S.-Soviet relationship that mattered most to the Soviets until concrete agreements emerged affecting hostile Soviet activities in the developing regions. The administration now asks that we approve of an INF agreement that lets the Soviets off the hook of a major strategic blunder, with no credible indications that such agreements have been or will be achieved.    Where is the agreement to secure Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, or the cessation of Soviet support for Nicaragua's campaign of aggression and subversion in Central America? Where is the agreement to secure the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, or Vietnamese troops from Cambodia? As part of a package that included some or all of these elements, the INF agreement would make strategic sense for the U.S. In their absence, it occasions serious doubts.    In recent days, the Soviets have floated tantalizing possibilities that are not quite promises of things to come. Administration officials, including the president, have offered firm promises that human-rights and regional-security issues will be raised during the summit with Mr. Gorbachev. But will any of them be settled?    The Soviets just backed a major offensive against pro-American freedom forces in Angola. They have sustained their heavy military support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. They have done nothing to encourage the withdrawal of Soviet-backed Vietnamese invaders from Cambodia. Yet the Reagan administration has returned to the worn-out formula Ronald Reagan criticized in his predecessors: Sign the agreement and hope, without reason, for the best.    As a candidate in the '70s, and as president in 1981, Mr. Reagan understood that such an approach fails to promote America's overall strategic interests. Those interests demand that the Soviets cease to war on American interests in key regions of the world. Absent agreements that secure this cease-fire, even a technically sound INF agreement is a bad deal.    ---   Mr. Keyes is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
