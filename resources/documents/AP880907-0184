The latest suspect is a Tel Aviv eye, nose and ear specialistwho allegedly sold false medical certificates. Israel radio saidthe doctor, Gideon Bialistock, was a Dutch citizen who has lived inIsrael on a tourist visa for 20 years.   Some Israelis have paid up to $10,000 for exemptions fromcompulsory military service.   Later Wednesday, authorities released a lieutenant colonel, oneof 16 suspects taken into custody Monday, Israel Television said.It did not elaborate.   The scandal came to light Monday when military and civilianpolice arrested 16 Israelis, including high-ranking officers anddoctors, after a six-month undercover investigation.   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres praised the army's response. ``Iappreciate the fact that the army reacted immediately, publicly,and didn't cover up anything,'' he said on Israel radio. Peres is aformer defense minister.   Army officials said they would review the procedures forgranting exemptions.   The scandal has angered Israelis who consider the army a sacredinstitution and inspired scathing editorials in many newspapers.   ``The uncovering of an entire network ... whose beneficiariesmay have run into the hundreds poses a new problem for the army,''the Jerusalem Post said. It cautioned against ``crying havoc'' butrecommended ``greater vigilance'' in the future.   Members of the ring allegedly arranged exemptions from draft orreserve duty for hundreds of people by providing false medicalcertificates or tampering with army computers.   Two army majors are the key suspects, Israel radio saidWednesday _ one who had access to army computers and another whoheaded the manpower division's medical committee.   It said a brigadier general was suspected of involvement in thescheme but had not yet been arrested.   Army officials said further arrests were expected.   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Col. RenaanGissin, a deputy army spokesman. ``The last word has not beensaid.''   He described the number of people involved as unprecedented.   Jewish men and women are drafted at age 18 in Israel, whosepopulation is 4.1 million. Men serve for three years, followed by62 days of reserve duty each year until age 55. Women serve twoyears, with no obligatory reserve duty.   Avoiding service is a social taboo and many employers askapplicants to prove they did army service.   Israel has virtually no conscientious objectors and fewer than300 people have refused to serve in controversial operations inLebanon or the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip during the lastdecade.</TEXT></DOC>
