MichelAoun on Wednesday of obstructing peace efforts, and the armycommander replied that Christians who support a Syrian-backed planshould have their throats cut.   ``We've tried all means to liberate Lebanon from foreign forcesthroughout the 14 years of war, but we haven't succeeded,'' saidGeorge Saadeh, head of the right-wing Phalange Party, the largestChristian political group.   ``The national reconciliation charter is a peace offensive toliberate Lebanon without bloodshed,'' he said in an interview,referring to a plan devised by legislators at a three-week meetingin Taif, Saudi Arabia.   ``I don't understand why he (Aoun) doesn't want to give peace achance,'' Saadeh, 57, said in his home village of Shibtine, 27miles north of Beirut.   He was interviewed after Aoun, who commands Lebanon's Christianarmy units, declared: ``Those who support the Arab solution deserveto have their throats and tongues cut. ... We are not going to belenient with them.''   Shiite Moslem militias allied with Iran and Syria battled inBeirut's southern slums for a second night Wednesday. Police saidtwo people had been killed and 11 wounded since fighting beganTuesday between Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian fundamentalist group, andthe more moderate Amal, allied with Syria.   Amal and Hezbollah are rivals for supremacy among the 1.2million Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon's 4 million people.   Saadeh, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, also leads the LebaneseFront alliance of Christian groups and is a member of Parliament.He was the main Christian negotiator in Taif last month on the planto end the sectarian civil war, which has cost more than 150,000lives.   Parliament ratified the accord, known in Lebanon as the nationalreconciliation charter, on Nov. 4 during a session inSyrian-controlled north Lebanon that also chose Rene Mouawad, aChristian, as president.   Aoun rejected the Taif accord because it does not include atimetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon,whom he describes as an occupation force.   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandategranted in 1976, the year after the civil war began. They andAoun's forces fought a six-month artillery war that killed hundredsof people, nearly all civilians, before the Arab League arranged atruce in September.   The 54-year-old general, who had led a Christian Cabinet sinceSeptember 1988 that competed with a Moslem government, decalredParliament dissolved in an attempt to stop ratification of thepeace plan. Legislators convened in north Lebanon because hethreatened to shell the Parliament building in Beirut.   He also claimed Mouawad was elected illegally, but Saadeh saidWednesday ``the election of President Mouawad is 100 percent inline with the constitution.''   Mouawad has designated Sunni Moslem politician Salim Hoss, wholed the Moslem government in competition with Aoun's, as primeminister to form a national reconciliation government on the basisof the Taif accord.   A major goal of the peace agreement is to give Moslems a greatershare of power in Lebanon, where they now make up 55 percent of thepopulation. Christians were in the majority when the country becameindependent of France in 1943 and have controlled the government,judiciary and army.   In his capacity as caretaker finance minister, Hoss instructedthe ministry and central bank Wednesday to allow only Mouawad towithdraw presidential funds, which Aoun had been using.   Hoss told The Associated Press by telephone the order wasintended to ``stop Aoun from withdrawing from the presidency'saccount. Now we have a president. He is the only one who has theright to control this account.''   Under an unwritten covenant observed since 1943, Lebanon'spresident is Christian, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and theParliament speaker Shiite Moslem.   Saadeh said Aoun's government ``will cease to be a legitimatecabinet the moment President Mouawad announces the formation of anew government.''   The competing Christian and Moslem governments were formed whenPresident Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended in September 1988 withParliament unable to agree on a successor. Hoss had been primeminister under Gemayel.   ``We should have listened to the advice of those who cautionedus that Aoun might become a dictator, a military ruler,'' Saadehsaid.   The interview was conducted as as delegations from villages inthe northern province of Batroun arrived at his home tocongratulate him for supporting the peace accord.   An old man hugged and kissed Saadeh, who has represented Batrounin Parliament since 1968, and said: ``Peace ought to have a hero.He is the hero of peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
