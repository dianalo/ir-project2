Barry T. Bergeron was charged with two counts of mail fraud, onecount of extortion and one count of federal income tax evasion,according to the indictment returned Friday.   If convicted he faces up to 35 years in jail and a $112,000 fine.   According to the indictment, Bergeron, a former city revenuecollection supervisor, prepared fraudulent business tax returns inexchange for monthly payments. U.S. Attorney John Volz would notspecify the amount of the payments.   ``The city taxes uncollected would probably be in the millions,''Volz said.   New Orleans is particularly strapped for cash. To erase a $30million deficit for 1989, the city council has had to cut spendingand raise taxes.   Volz indicated that a plea bargain had been struck with Bergeron,but would not elaborate. No arraignment date has been announced.   Volz said that the government could have charged Bergeron with 80counts of mail fraud _ one for each of the businesses with which hedealt _ but did not.   None of the 80 business owners were indicted, but Volz said theinvestigation is continuing and that his office is also looking atpossible involvement by city elected officials.   In June, a federal court jury convicted former city tax collectorBrian Eastwold of extortion, mail fraud and obstruction of justicefor taking bribes to reduce a business owner's sales tax liability.   The first count of mail fraud stems from Bergeron's mailing of acity sales tax form to the Ideal Food Store.   The second mail fraud charge involves a scheme to help somegrocery store owners in redeeming unused merchandise cents-offcoupons for about $66,000. Volz said that some of the stores inBergeron's coupon scheme also were involved in under-reporting theirincome.   The indictment says Bergeron under-reported the businesses'income on federal and state tax returns.   Bergeron is also charged with under-reporting his and his wife'sjoint 1987 income by $30,088. Volz refused to connect that moneywith the payments Bergeron allegedly received from the businessowners to prepare their taxes.   ``People will repay what they owe,'' Volz said when questionedabout possible proceedings against the business owners.</TEXT></DOC>
