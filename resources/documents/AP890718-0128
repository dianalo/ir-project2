The London-based group said witnesses reported the seven men weretaken away during police raids in April 1987 and January 1988.   It said authorities at first acknowledged some of the detentionsbut later denied them.   In a report released Wednesday, Amnesty International called for``speedy, impartial and independent investigations'' into these andother disappearances. It also said police and security forcesimplicated in such cases should be prosecuted.   Indian courts have in rare cases held police or army officialsresponsible for disappearances and ordered states to paycompensation to relatives. However, no officials are known to havebeen prosecuted or convicted in such cases, the report said.   The three Sikhs, who were suspected of political violence in thenorthern state of Punjab, disappeared in mid-January 1988 afterreportedly being arrested by plainclothes officers in Chandigarh andMohali, the report said.   The government has tried to put down a movement of Sikh militantswho want a separate homeland. In June 1984, authorities raided theSikh Golden Temple at Amritsar, leaving 1,200 people dead.   The report identified the three detained Sikhs as mechanic ManjitSingh, electrician Jatinder Pal Singh and taxi driver BalwinderSingh.   It said fellow detainees, whose identities were not published,claimed they saw the first two at Mayi Ki Sarai interrogation centerat the end of January 1988 and said the men had been severelytortured, the report said.   Another former detainee at the interrogation center said he sawthe third man, taxi driver Balwinder Singh, and said he also hadbeen tortured. No date was given for when he was reportedly seen.   Amnesty International, which has been barred by Prime MinisterRajiv Gandhi from visiting Punjab, says most cases of disappearancesin the state are difficult to verify. But it said the three cases inthe report ``were well-documented, sometimes by eyewitnesses.''   The human rights group said the other missing men include truckdriver Puran Singh, described by police as a robber, and his18-year-old assistant, Shyam Singh.   They were last seen by relatives at an apartment in Nai Abadi inthe Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh on April 10, 1987, the reportsaid.   Witnesses said the men were taken away by police officers of theLajpat Nagar station in New Delhi, apparently on suspicion ofrobbery, according to the report. Police said they went to thesuspects' house but made no arrests.   Two farmers, Veer Singh, and his cousin Tilak Ram, were reportedto disappear that same day in an apparently related police raid inBaraundi, 30 miles away, the report said.   ``There is strong evidence that (the four) have been killed,either by shooting or following torture while in police custody, andthat staff of the South Delhi police have tried to cover up themurder,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
