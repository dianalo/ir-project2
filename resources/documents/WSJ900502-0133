Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><GV>LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration endorsed legislationthat would substantially stiffen some penalties foremployers' workplace-safety violations.   Testifying before the Senate labor subcommittee, GerardScannell, assistant secretary of labor, said the LaborDepartment supports provisions of pending bills that wouldtriple potential civil penalties for safety and healthviolations and upgrade from misdemeanors to felonies anywillful violations that cause death.</LP><TEXT>   Tripling civil penalties, as provided in a bill offered bySen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), could sharply escalatefines imposed by the department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration, which Mr. Scannell heads. It wouldallow fines of $30,000 for each violation; currently, thelimit is $10,000 per violation, which, in recent years, hasitself resulted in multimillion-dollar OSHA citations againstsome large employers.   Last month, for instance, the agency proposed fines of$5.7 million against Phillips Petroleum Co., stemming fromexplosions in October at a Houston-area plastics plant, whichkilled 23 workers. Earlier, OSHA proposed a record $7.3million in fines against USX Corp., citing numerous healthand safety violations at two plants.   While the citations usually are sharply scaled down insettlements, Mr. Scannell said that since 1986, the agencyhas issued about 100 citations for &quot;egregious&quot; violations toabout 90 employers. He said about two-thirds of thosecitations have already been settled, &quot;securing swiftabatement of hazards,&quot; and resulted in about $15 million infines.   Mr. Scannell also backed changing to felonies frommisdemeanors those willful violations that lead to death inorder to encourage U.S. attorneys to prosecute such OSHAcases.   Mr. Scannell's testimony also contained the LaborDepartment's first formal declaration that OSHA enforcementdoesn't preempt state and local prosecution of employermisconduct involving workplace health or safety violations.States shouldn't be pre-empted from enforcing criminal lawsthat deal with murder, manslaughter or assault, he said. Buthe said that purely regulatory laws, which make it a crimefor employers to violate particular health or safetystandards, should be pre-empted unless they're part of anOSHA-approved state regulatory plan.   Although OSHA has been working with state and localprosecutors who pursue criminal workplace health or safetycases against employers, the department previously hadn'ttaken a stand on the preemption issue. The JusticeDepartment, however, has stated that OSHA doesn't pre-emptsuch prosecutions.</TEXT></DOC>
