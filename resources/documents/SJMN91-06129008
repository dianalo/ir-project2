In order to touch this deal, you gotta put upsome of your own money. Like about $950,000.;    This unique investmentopportunity comes courtesy of John Dyer, the developer who sold Hammer theland for a yet-to-be-built $4 million mansion in the Fremont hills. Dyer nowwants to sell a $1 million note he holds on the property, apparently becausehe needs the cash to develop another spacious estate next door.;    Dyer, whohas been advertising the note for the past several weeks, declined to discussthe offer.

The asking price represents the present valueof the note, which pays 11.5 percent interest and will mature in September of1995.;    And then there's the extra incentive of owning an investment thatgenerates regular checks backed by the full faith and credit of a three-timeGrammy winner.;    &quot;It's not bad security,&quot; Mellema said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM SCHMITZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910508  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  197  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 8, 199100129008,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
