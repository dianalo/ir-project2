Mitterrand and President Reagan have both attended the pasteight summits. While Reagan prepares for retirement, the71-year-old Frenchman has just won re-election to a secondseven-year term.   But the fresh mandate does not seem to have given Mitterrandgreater weight with his peers, or at least not enough to counteracthis isolation as the only leftist among the seven heads of stateand government wrapping up their three-day summit today.   Mitterrand has abandoned the radical economic policies of1981-83, his first years in office, but still is a long way fromsinging harmony with his conservative colleagues _ especiallyReagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   But at the same time, he no longer needs to fear oppositionwithin his own delegation. From March 1986 until last month,Mitterrand was stuck in an uneasy power-sharing arrangement called``cohabitation'' with Premier Jacques Chirac, an enthusiasticfollower of Reagan- and Thatcher-style economics.   Chirac started selling off many of the banks and industriesnationalized by the Socialists, but that was ended by Mitterrand'sre-election last month and his appointment of Socialist MichelRocard as premier in a new government.   The French newspaper Le Monde published a front-page cartoonshowing an absent-minded Reagan greeting Mitterrand at the summit'sopening and saying, ``I don't see Jacques Chirac. Is he sick?''   At the summit, Mitterrand has been the odd man out onnon-economic issues as well.   He objected to a U.S. proposal to create a seven-nation taskforce on drugs, spokesman Hubert Vedrine said, because he does notthink the annual summits should take on duties and activitiesduring the rest of the year.   Rather than veto the proposal, Mitterrand abstained on awatered-down version that did not specify which nations might bemembers, even though he still was opposed in principle, thespokesman said.   ``France abstained to let this text pass,'' Vedrine said. ``Thefight against drugs is too important for us to block progress forwhatever reason.''   Vedrine said Mitterrand was pleased by the summit's declarationMonday on relations with the Soviet Union, saying the seven leadershave come around to agree with the French president's desire toimprove relations with the East bloc.   American and British officials, however, said it was the toughWestern stands of previous years that helped bring about changes inthe Soviet Union that make better relations possible.   Aside from his political differences with his colleagues,Mitterrand also faces a language barrier. He speaks only French, sothe only summit leaders with whom he can converse without aninterpreter are Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who isfluently bilingual, and Jacques Delors, the Frenchman who heads theEuropean Economic Community.   Mitterrand's austere style also clashes with Reagan's heartycheer and with Thatcher's uncompromising directness, so that afternearly a decade together at the summit, there is little apparentwarmth between them.   At this year's summit, Mitterrand's chief goal was an initiativeto relieve the debts of the world's poorest nations, including manyformer French colonies in Africa.   Officials from other delegations said some debt proposal wassure to win approval, but not in the form Mitterrand proposed in aletter to his colleagues two weeks ago.   ``Mitterrand is very associated with this issue and his views onit are respected,'' said a Canadian official, speaking on conditionof anonymity _ and leaving unspoken the implication that his viewson economics get less attention.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Charles Campbell is the AP's news editor inParis.</TEXT></DOC>
