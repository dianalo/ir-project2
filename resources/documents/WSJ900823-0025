Under its proposal, CrossLand, the biggest thrift outsideCalifornia, would have converted $380 million in preferredstock, which can't be counted as core capital, into commonshares, which do count toward the new capital standards. Witha 1.6% ratio of capital to assets, CrossLand falls at least$335.6 million short of satisfying the 3% level required bylaw. The conversion of the preferred into common shares wouldhave satisfied the 3% requirement.</LP><TEXT>   However, CrossLand, which has $12.8 billion in assets,said that the Office of Thrift Supervision has indicated thatit wants an even higher level of capital for CrossLandbecause of its relatively large exposure to commercial realestate loans. Nonperforming assets, largely commercial realestate loans, stood at $563 million as of June 30.   The OTS gave CrossLand until Dec. 31, 1991, to come upwith a new plan to meet the capital requirements.   Maurice Reissman, chairman, president and chief executiveofficer, said that it was his understanding that the OTSdidn't object to the conversion of the preferred shares intocommon but rather wanted CrossLand to raise more capital.   Mr. Reissman called the new deadline &quot;an appropriateamount of time.&quot; He added, &quot;The game plan, candidly is towait until the OTS tells us the capital requirement that theywant us to meet. It is still my intent to go back to thepreferred shareholders and ask them to convert into commonequity.&quot;   CrossLand could meet the higher capital standards throughasset sales as well as raising new equity.   An earlier plan to have Chicago's Pritzker family and NewYork investor Alvin Dworman invest $150 million in CrossLandin return for 85% of its common stock was scuttled in Marchbecause of shareholders' objections.   If the OTS calls for a significantly higher capital levelfor CrossLand than the rest of the industry, analysts saidthat the Brooklyn-based thrift faces an uphill fight, despiteits attractive consumer franchise with 82 branches in NewYork, Florida, New Jersey and elsewhere. Henry Peltz, asecurities analyst with Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said,&quot;They'll have a hard time. CrossLand is more or less beingkept alive by sufferance.&quot;   In addition, the federal Office of Thrift Supervisionimposed new restrictions on CrossLand, including directivesnot to make any new loans other than residential mortgage andconsumer loans without federal permission.   The OTS loan restrictions won't pose a serious problem forCrossLand, Mr. Peltz said. In the last six months, CrossLandhas shed $1.4 billion in assets and in in the past 18 monthshas pared its junk bond portfolio down to $19.5 million from$193 million.   In the second quarter, CrossLand posted a loss of $40million, or $3.64 a share, after taking a $50 million specialcharge for problem real estate loans.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchangeyesterday, CrossLand closed unchanged at 87.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
