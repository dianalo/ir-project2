At least three deaths were blamed on the storm. A man died afterfalling from a Chevron oil platform off of Louisiana and two Bryanteen-agers drowned when they were sucked into a flood-swollendrainage ditch.   Also today, Tropical Storm Dean developed into the secondhurricane of the Atlantic season, bearing 78 mph winds it surgedwestward toward the Caribbean. The hurricane was 500 miles east ofSan Juan, Puerto Rico, moving at 20 mph.   Chantal roared ashore Tuesday morning at High Island on theeastern Texas coast, bringing driving rain and wind up to 80 mph.The first hurricane of the Atlantic season caused flooding andscattered power outages but little serious damage.   It lost strength within a few hours and was downgraded to atropical storm and then a tropical depression by Tuesday night.Winds dropped to about 30 mph.   By early today, the storm's remains were spread over about 90miles from College Station to Waco, triggering rain and tornadoes.No damage was immediately reported in central Texas. Forecasterssaid the Dallas-Fort Worth area could get as much as 5 inches ofrain in gusty thunderstorms today.   Divers today resumed their searched for the oil workers 20 milesoff Morgan City, La. Their self-propelled rig, which can be floatedwhen its 100-foot legs are retracted, capsized Monday while tryingto outrun Chantal.   Rough seas hampered the divers, who were equipped withhigh-powered lights to search the darkened rig. There wereconflicting reports about where the men were last seen _ in thewater or in the watertight crew quarters now submerged in about 30feet of water, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Glenn LaMont.   ``They're not sure where they're likely to be, exactly. It'sgoing to take awhile. The divers are going to move real slow andreal cautiously,'' he said.   In Bryan, about 90 miles northwest of Houston, police said twoteen-agers drowned while they and two friends were riding rubberrafts on a rain-swollen stream. The boys were swept into a drainagepipe under a highway bypass.   Skies were sunny today in the Houston area, where on Tuesdayhundreds of stalled cars and trucks lined flooded roads and somemotorists sat atop their vehicles as they waited for the water torecede.   Nena Neal, whose family lost nearly all of their possessions ina 1979 flood in Dickinson, south of Houston, tied ribbons aroundthe bases of trees to watch the progress of the rising water in heryard.   ``We just got through celebrating 10 years since that flood. Wehad water up to here in that one,'' Mrs. Neal said, using her handto mark a spot more than 3 feet high. ``We made it through that andthe Lord gave us so much more. And we have flood insurance thistime _ that's the main thing.''   The coastal city of Galveston escaped much of Chantal's wrath,but the 6.56 inches of rain in a 24-hour period there broke a110-year-old record.   Most of the homes in the area directly hit by Chantal were builton stilts, limiting much of the damage to roof tiles, exteriorwalls and electric lines. ``It wasn't too bad, but it sure shookthat trailer,'' said Bill Estis, who lives in a 27-foot traveltrailer in Gilchrist, east of Galveston. ``I was going to move itout this morning, but it came in too early so I just decided towait it out.''   Estis then did what few others along the Texas coast would haveconsidered in winds topping 50 mph on the leading edge of ahurricane.   He went fishing.   ``Oh, I just figured I'd come down here and give it a try. Icaught one while the eye was passing over, but I haven't had a bitesince then,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
