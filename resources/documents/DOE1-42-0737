In thiscircumstance, the Japanese government required utilities to establishan EOF at each nuclear power station site last year (1985). This paperreports on Japanese utilities design criteria of EOF and the Tokyo ElectricPower Company's (TEPCO) SPDS planning. The TEPCO owns ten operating nuclearpower units which are BWR and have a total of 9100MW generation capability.The TEPCO has been preparing a SPDS which will be installed in the EOFand main control room. In Fukushima Daiichi (1F) nuclear power stationsite of TEPCO where there are six units, the SPDS consists of a new computersystem, color CRT terminals and a high speed optical fiber data transmissionsystem which is to link EOF on site to the CRT terminal in the main controlroom of each unit. A part of 1F units will start SPDS operation in 1987and all units will be complete by 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
