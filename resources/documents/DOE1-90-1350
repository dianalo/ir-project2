Flute disturbance and related to it conductiondisturbance may propagate transverse to magnetic force lines and grow.Disturbance propagates predominantly in the direction of nondisturbedionosphere current with the rate several times as much as that of electricdrift. Propagating to the west glow waves and related to them Ps6 phenomenaobserved during substorm are manifestations of these waves.</TEXT></DOC>
