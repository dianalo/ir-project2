The escape of fast electrons from adischarge due to fluctuations in the electric and magnetic fields ina plasma is studied as an example. The role played by this diffusionmechanism is studied for both trapped and untrapped particles in variousdrive regimes. A beam of resonant particles accelerated by lower-hybridwaves, as an entity which is quite anisotropic in velocity space, isa convenient diagnostic tool for determining the nature of the diffusingparticles.</TEXT></DOC>
