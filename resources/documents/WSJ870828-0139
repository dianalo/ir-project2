The bill, introduced after the disclosure of illegal sales to the Soviet Union of sophisticated milling machines that can make quieter submarine propellers, now goes to the upper house for final approval.    A lower-house official said that in a standing vote on the bill, members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party voted in favor, while the socialists and other opposition members opposed it.    Opposition members have said the measure lacks a clear statement defining punishable conduct.    The milling-machine sales to the Soviets by a unit of the major electronics company Toshiba Corp. violated both Japanese law and rules of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which regulates exports to communist countries. U.S. officials said the machinery enables the Soviets to build submarines that are harder to detect.    Since disclosure of the case in March, Japan has been under pressure to further tighten its export controls.    The legislation would increase the maximum prison term for convicted violators to five years from three, and double the fine to two million yen ($14,000) from one million yen. It also would increase to three years from the current one the period for which the government could ban violators from making any sales to communist countries. </TEXT></DOC>
