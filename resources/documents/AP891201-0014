At 11 a.m. EST, the storm was near latitude 19.0 north,longitude 83.2 west, about 130 miles west of Grand Cayman Islandand about 300 miles south of Havana, said forecasters at theNational Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.   Karen's highest sustained winds were 40 mph. The storm wasdrifting south at 5 mph after a Thursday encounter with a coldfront and was expected to slow to a halt today.   Storm warnings were posted for western and central Cuba and theIsle of Youth.   Forecaster Miles Lawrence said satellite pictures showed an areaof thunderstorms over the system's center. ``That could indicatetemporary strengthening,'' he said. ``It was not really expected.''   The system surprised forecasters by achieving tropical stormstrength Thursday when its winds hit 39 mph.   Many communities in South Florida had hoped the storm would helpease a near-record water shortage, which has led to mandatory waterrestrictions in some areas.   But it seemed Cuba and its coastal waters would get most of thestorm's rains, Lawrence said.   The hurricane center reported more than 14 inches of rain fellon Punta del Este on the Isle of Youth Thursday. More than 7 inchesin Matanzas and nearly 5 inches in Havana.   The hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. However,hurricanes have been recorded in every month but April.</TEXT></DOC>
