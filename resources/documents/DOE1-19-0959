In urine they are present as metabolites and, in very littlepart, as parent compound. The urinary concentration of solvent (Cu) canbe used for the biological monitoring of exposed subjects to evaluatetheir exposure and correlate with the Threshold Limit Value (TLV) duringthe working day. The authors report some results obtained with workersoccupationally exposed to solvents. The results concern the correlationbetween urinary concentration (Cu, micrograms/L) vs. average environmentalconcentration (Ci, mg/m3) measured in the breathing zone. For each solventstudied (acetone, 2-cyclohexane, 1,2-dichloropropane, n-hexane, methylethyl ketone, perchloroethylene, styrene, toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane)the authors propose a Biological Equivalent Exposure Limit (BEEL) correspondingto the environmental TLV.</TEXT></DOC>
