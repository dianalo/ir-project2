Superpower relations are improved. Summits are an annual event.There is a treaty on the books banning intermediate-range nuclearmissiles. Negotiators are working on another to sharply reduce U.S.and Soviet stockpiles of long-range rockets.   But terrorism has not receded as a threat to mankind. PresidentCarter's patient probing eventually brought the Americans home fromTehran, but only after 444 miserable days in captivity.   President Reagan's stern threat of ``swift and effectiveretribution'' did not prevent the bombing of the U.S. embassy inBeirut in April 1983, killing 17 Americans, or the slaughter of 241Marines and sailors near the city's airport less than six monthslater.   Reagan White House operatives Robert McFarlane, John Poindexterand Oliver North sought to barter arms for Iranian moderation _ andthe release of American hostages in Lebanon _ but they failed, aswell.   The U.S. bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 may havequieted Libyan Col. Moammar Gadhafi down a bit, but the attack didnot put terrorism back in its box.   Just this week:   Iranian radicals made plans for a rally of hatred outside theformer U.S. embassy on Saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of itsseizure.   Iran approved a law Wednesday giving it the power to arrestAmericans anywhere and put them on trial.   Gunmen in Beirut the same day killed a Saudi diplomat andwounded his driver. Hours later, Islamic Holy War, a pro-Iraniangroup, took responsibility for the assault.   Over the last 10 years there have been signs of progress.   Airport security is tighter. Libya's plan to build a chemicalweapons plant was exposed by then-Secretary of State George P.Shultz. The West German government was forced to admit West Germanfirms had been helping the Libyans.   President Bush proposed in September eliminating most U.S. andSoviet chemical weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze went him one better and urged getting rid of all ofthem.   The idea is to set a standard for 40 nations meeting in Genevato ban the production of chemical weapons and as a result denytheir use to terrorists.   The U.S. and Soviet proposals are a start in seeking a solution.But some experts doubt that a completely reliable way of stoppingall production everywhere can be devised.   In a new book, ``Final Warning: Averting Disaster in the New Ageof Terrorism,'' analyst Robert Kupperman and reporter Jeff Kamenoffer the gloomy suggestion that the United States and its alliesare about to enter an era of terrorist attacks deadlier than everbefore.   The main reason is more sophisticated technology. Another,ironically, is the fact that democracies play by rules thatsometimes protect terrorists.   A case in point from the book:   Three years ago, Yu Kikumura, described as a member of theJapanese Red Army, a small global terror gang, was arrested atSchipol Airport in Amsterdam with a bomb concealed in a can ofbreakfast food in his luggage.   At trial, though, a Dutch judge ruled the search of Kikumura'sluggage was illegal. The case was dismissed and Kikumura wasdeported to Japan.   Last year, he was driving on the New Jersey turnpike when astate trooper found three bombs hidden in his car. In aconfidential message at the trial last February, the U.S. attorneysaid Kikumura's goal was ``mass slaughter'' of Americans inretaliation for the raids on Libya.   He was convicted, but his lawyers said they would appeal on thegrounds the trooper conducted an illegal search.   ``Final Warning'' stands as a message as well as a book title.   While Kupperman and Kamen conclude that terrorists haveaccomplished few of their goals to date, the ability of a smallnumber of hard-core, trained and highly motivated agents to exploitthe openness of free societies poses an awesome challenge.   ``The world will soon pay a high price for more than 20 years ofcollective cowardice and indecision by democracies that failed totake terrorism seriously, and for a concomitant period of callous,Machiavellian use of terror by hostile governments,'' the authorswarn.   ``Those hostile regimes correctly defined terror as acost-effective and plausibly deniable method of waging war, whichcarries little, if any, risk to their lands.   ``Nations that have employed terrorist groups as surrogates,including Syria, Iran and Libya, have only lately been called toaccount _ and with insignificant consequences.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid covers diplomacy and nationalsecurity for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
