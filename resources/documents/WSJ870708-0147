Like the proverbial blind men describing an elephant by touch, they all sense true things, but important parts of the elephant are still left out. One is the role of exchange rates. Trade laws take exchange rates for granted. Yet the crucial nexus in dumping cases between a &quot;fair&quot; price and the price for export to the United States is the exchange rate, which varies capriciously with little relationship to comparative advantage based on real costs. Similarly, export subsidies are usually alternative strategies to exchange-rate adjustments. For this reason and others, the distinction between fair and unfair trade that is fundamental to U.S. trade law is largely spurious.    The second part left out is that the laws against unfair trade are working badly because they are already too complicated and involve too much adversarial litigation. Trade lawyers could once, with knowledge of the facts, predict where a trade case would come out; but no longer. Congress is going in precisely the wrong direction in continuing to try to tighten the laws. What is needed is more discretion, administrative finality and opportunity to settle cases, not less.    A deeper fallacy underlies these misdirected efforts, namely, that legal formulas and proceedings can resolve trade-policy issues automatically. The problems of the auto, steel and semiconductor industries have been real. Their claims to special attention from the government have been politically irresistible and economically a matter for fair debate. Difficult government decisions could have been made more effectively and more honestly -- whether pro or con -- under Section 201. This is a rational statute in which legalisms play no great role, calling as it does for impartial investigation of the problems of the domestic industry and a presidential decision based on all aspects of the national interest.
