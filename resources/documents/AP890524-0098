But Li faced new opposition within the policy-making PolitburoStanding Committee and from China's best-known author, who joinedthe multitudes opposing the conservative premier.   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said a Politburo meeting would becalled Thursday or Friday.   Also today, China informed Western television stations it wascutting off satellite transmissions as of midnight, ending theirability to broadcast from China.   Li declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday, ordering troopsto restore order in the city where more than 1 million people haverallied in support of a student campaign for a freer China and anend to official corruption.   The student protests have galvanized the nation, inspiring thelargest spontaneous movement in Communist China's 40 years.   Soldiers were deployed on Beijing's outskirts today but did notmove on tens of thousands of student protesters, now on their 12thday of a sit-in at central Tiananmen Square.   Over the weekend, throngs of city residents erected streetbarricades to prevent an army advance, stalling convoys. Hundredsof thousands of protesters also took to the streets in dozens ofother cities. All reportedly called for Li's ouster.   Subway and bus service resumed in Beijing and traffic appearednear normal today.   Although the army's inability to enforce martial law has calledinto doubt its willingness to follow Li's orders, the officialXinhua News Agency said six of seven military regions supported thedecision to call troops to Beijing. Only the Beijing militarycommand was not mentioned.   Liberation Army Daily, the military newspaper, today published aletter from army headquarters urging soldiers sent to enforcemartial law to ``fully understand the nature of this struggle.''   The letter said ``the turmoil created by an extremely smallnumber of people still has not been quelled. If their schemesucceeds, then the 10 years of hard struggle for reform and thework of establishing of modernizing socialism will be destroyed ina moment.''   On Monday, however, more than 100 senior army officers signed aletter seeking an end to martial law, suggesting a deep split inthe military.   Two government sources said today that Hu Qili, one of fivemembers in the policy-making Politburo Standing Committee, hadthrown his support to the relatively liberal Communist Party chiefZhao Ziyang, who is battling Li.   Hu is in charge of the state-run press. On Tuesday, someofficial reports criticized Li's attempts to carry out martial law.   Reports circulated that Zhao _ who had urged conciliation withthe students _ had offered to resign rather than order troops intoBeijing.   In the first indication of Zhao's status in days, the foreignminister told diplomats Tuesday that Zhao had returned to work.   Early today, Xinhua mentioned Zhao for the first time sincebefore the martial law order and referred to him as party generalsecretary.   Wan Li, president of the National People's Congress, cut short aU.S. visit Tuesday after meeting with President Bush. U.S.officials said Wan, who has praised the students for theirpatriotic fervor, was expected to call an emergency meeting of thelegislature and press for Li's ouster.   In Shanghai, author Ba Jin, the chairman of the Chinese Writers'Association, was one of 500 intellectuals and high-ranking partymembers to sign a letter blasting the speech Li made Friday thatsignaled the start of a crackdown.   The letter also told the party to end press censorship and bringits struggle into the open.   ``For 40 years now the party has made a series of major mistakesbecause life inside the party is not normal,'' the letter said.``We must open the party to the supervision of the people.''   The student movement started April 15 following the death ofousted Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a favorite withintellectuals.   Students initially called for a freer society and press and anend to official corruption, but after martial law was ordered theydemanded that senior leaders resign.   The struggle centers around Li's conservative faction, whichopposes political reform, and a liberal group which has pushed somedemocratic reforms of China's political system.   ``They might allow him (Li) to go as a sacrifice,'' said onesource. ``He has handled the martial law situation very badly.''   Deng Xiaoping, the 84-year-old senior leader, apparently backedLi's effort to suppress the student movement. But now his positionis unknown.   Another member of the conservative group is Li Ximing, the partyboss for Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
