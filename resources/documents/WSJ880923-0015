In a chaotic hearing yesterday attended by at least 50 attorneys, the lawyers for Drexel and other defendants sparred with federal Judge Milton Pollack over how -- and whether -- he should preside over the Securities and Exchange Commission's massive case against Drexel, its junk-bond chief Michael Milken and others.    Judge Pollack refused their request that he decide no other issues before he rules on their motion to remove him from the case, a motion that was filed earlier and wasn't made part of the public record.    Meanwhile, an official in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan said in a letter to the judge that Drexel and the other defendants have at least temporarily given up on their effort to compel testimony and documents from former takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky or companies related to him. Mr. Boesky is believed to be the government's chief informant against Drexel and the others.    But late yesterday some individuals familiar with Drexel's defense said the letter didn't accurately reflect their agreement. They said they had merely agreed to consider on a case-by-case basis the U.S. Attorney's request that they put off compelling certain testimony and documents from Mr. Boesky and others while the government pursues its continuing criminal investigation.    The hearing, the first court session in the Drexel case, was marked by sharp exchanges between the judge and defense attorneys for Mr. Milken and Drexel. At one point, Judge Pollack pointed at Arthur Liman, Mr. Milken's attorney, and branded Mr. Liman's comments &quot;nonsensical.&quot;    As previously reported, Judge Pollack agreed to the SEC's request earlier this month that he preside over its massive civil case, which the SEC maintained is closely related to 13 private suits pending in his court against Drexel and others. Because Judge Pollack agreed that the cases are related, he sidestepped the usual case-lottery system of assigning judges.    The SEC complaint charges Drexel, Mr. Milken and others with insider trading and other securities-law violations. The 13 private suits involve a variety of allegations by investors and other individuals against Drexel, as well as Mr. Boesky, the imprisoned former arbitrager.    Defense lawyers were unsuccessful in gaining any concessions from Judge Pollack yesterday.    At the start of the 75-minute hearing, Peter Fleming, an attorney for Drexel, told Judge Pollack that it is &quot;Drexel's position that your honor shouldn't rule on any matter in the SEC case&quot; until the judge considers a motion by defense attorneys, filed earlier this week, that Drexel's case be tried separately from the 13 other actions. This would mean that another judge would likely be selected through a lottery. Judge Pollack denied Mr. Fleming's request, setting a hearing on the motion for Oct. 11 and refusing Mr. Fleming's request to move up that date.    Lawyers for Drexel and other defendants in the SEC action are expected to file a response by Tuesday to Judge Pollack's proposed provisions to manage the pretrial fact-finding process, known as discovery, in the cases. But yesterday, they appealed repeatedly to Judge Pollack to dissociate their case from the others and to allow the defendants in the SEC action to proceed separately.    Thomas Curnin, an attorney for Drexel, said the 13 civil suits represented &quot;five or six class actions in five or six securities, none of which are at issue in the SEC action.&quot; Mr. Liman added, &quot;All we really want is our own case.&quot;    Mr. Liman said the defendants in the SEC case feared that they would be bound by depositions taken by the other litigants in private actions barely related to the SEC suit and that the Drexel lawyers wouldn't be able to question the same witnesses again. Judge Pollack responded that his aim in coordinating pre-trial discovery among the cases was only to prevent repetitious questioning.    In another exchange, Mr. Curnin noted lawyers for the defendants had met with the SEC earlier this week and that the SEC had agreed to produce most documents requested by the attorneys.    But Thomas Newkirk, chief litigation counsel for the SEC, told Judge Pollack that the agency believes &quot;it's premature for depositions to take place&quot; before the documents are read by the defense lawyers. He said the SEC &quot;is prepared to produce all documents for discovery by Dec. 15,&quot; adding that there were more than 1.2 million documents to be sorted through. The Dec. 15 date brought gasps of surprise and protests from the defense lawyers, who were hoping to start taking depositions more quickly.    The exchanges between Judge Pollack and attorneys for Drexel and Mr. Milken became testy at times throughout the hearing. But the most heated dialogue occurred after Mr. Newkirk said the documents couldn't be turned over until December because they hadn't been sorted.    &quot;We'll take them all,&quot; Mr. Liman told Judge Pollack, referring to the SEC's documents.    &quot;That's a nonsensical suggestion,&quot; Judge Pollack replied. &quot;You can't have them all.&quot; The judge asked defense attorneys to &quot;coordinate your ideas with&quot; the SEC's ideas, and &quot;come up with relevant dates.&quot;    Also creating controversy was the letter to Judge Pollack, dated Sept. 21, in which Helen M. Toor, assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the U.S. attorney doesn't have any objection to most of the defense lawyers' requests to get documents and testimony from at least 50 individuals and companies. But in the letter, which wasn't part of a public file, Ms. Toor said the government is concerned with the lawyers' gaining access to documents &quot;reflecting communications between Mr. Boesky, his entities, employees, accountants or counsel and the SEC or Department of Justice,&quot; among others.    The letter said the defense attorneys &quot;have agreed to temporarily stay those depositions and document requests with which we have concern.&quot; But one individual familiar with the defense said, &quot;We never agreed to the way this {letter} was phrased at all.&quot;    Ms. Toor said yesterday that officials with the U.S. Attorney's office and defense lawyers in the SEC case have had &quot;a number of conversations&quot; in recent weeks and the lawyers understand her office's &quot;concerns.&quot; As previously reported, the U.S. Attorney's office has issued &quot;target letters&quot; to Mr. Milken and other individuals indicating that criminal charges are likely to be filed.    But according to individuals familiar with the defense, discussions were held primarily with Mr. Fleming. It isn't clear whether Mr. Fleming had ever agreed on behalf of the others to halt depositions of certain witnesses, they said. </TEXT></DOC>
