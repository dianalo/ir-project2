Perkins that the city reserve its dwindling sewercapacity for revenue-producing commerce and industry instead of houses.;   &quot;If the choice is to allocate capacity to residential or commercial-industrialdevelopment, the latter generally pays more in fees and taxes,&quot; Perkins saysin a memorandum.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SEWER CAPACITY: WHO GETS WHAT'S LEFT?M.H. URGED TO FAVOR INDUSTRY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The recommendation comes as officials face tough choices in adopting apared-down budget for next fiscal year, which Perkins says will requireclosing one of three fire stations and laying off 22 employees.;    Sewercapacity is limited because a 1986 lawsuit prevented Morgan Hill and Gilroyfrom expanding a jointly operated sewage plant. The lawsuit apparently hasbeen settled in favor of the two cities, but a new sewage plant won't beoperating until 1995.;    Meanwhile, city officials must figure out how to getthe most out of the current system. While there are 553,000 gallons of unusedcapacity, all but 50,500 gallons are reserved. A little more than 181,000gallons belong to the former Wiltron Corp. business park, while developers ofresidential, commercial and industrial projects have been promised theremainder.;    Since 50,500 gallons of sewer capacity won't come close tosatisfying the 236,000 gallons of capacity that will be demanded in the nextfour years, priorities must be set, city officials say.;    Perkins wants tohold the unallocated sewer capacity for an auto mall and two major shoppingcenters, which would require an estimated 55,200 gallons of capacity.;    Ifcouncil members agree, home builders would get nothing unless some of theWiltron Corp. reserve is loaned to them, Perkins says. She recommends that notmore than 25,000 gallons be earmarked for that purpose.;    The 387-acreWiltron business park, which was sold to Japanese investors, once owned300,000 gallons of sewer capacity. Besides the 180,000-gallon reserve, some ofthe Wiltron capacity has been used by park tenants and some was traded back tothe city.;    Currently, approximately 260 dwellings are without a sewerallocation. Some are units that have been approved but don't have a sewerhookup, while others represent undeveloped lots in existing subdivisions.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Morgan Hill City Council will discuss how toallocate the city's remaining sewer capacity at a meeting to start at 5:30p.m. today at City Hall, 17555 Peak Ave.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DALE RODEBAUGH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910416  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  394  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 16, 199100107136,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
