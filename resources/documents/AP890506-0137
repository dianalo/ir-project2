One child was seriously injured when a tornado touched down inRockingham County, N.C., but for the most part the new round ofstorms didn't measure up to the intensity of those the day before.   Seventy-five thousand customers of Duke Power Co. remainedwithout power, and company officials said it might be Monday beforeservice was restored.   As survivors searched through ruined houses for furthercasualties, they marveled at the destructive force of thethunderstorms that lashed the region Thursday and Friday, snappingtrees, leveling homes and gorging rivers from Texas to Virginia.   ``It's like you took a chain saw and cut down all the trees andleveled all the houses,'' said Bill Seagle, a member of the UpperCleveland Rescue Squad in Cleveland County, N.C.   In Virginia, four people died when they were swept out of theirvehicles in rain-swollen rivers.   A 3-year-old girl and her six-month-old sister were killed inCulpeper County after their mother was flushed out of the driver'sseat of their car as it crossed a bridge and the vehicle was sweptdownstream, police said.   In Buchanan County, a woman and her son were killed after theirpickup truck collided with another truck on Virginia 624 and thepickup was forced into the Powell River. The two were swept totheir deaths, and a third person in their truck was missing.   Elsewhere in Virginia, searchers found four canoeists who hadbeen reported missing on the Rappahannock River. In North Carolina,search parties rescued six members of a Boy Scout canoeing partywhose boats capsized.   Divers found the body of a 9-year-old at the bottom of a swollendrainage canal in Louisiana. The boy had fallen in while reachingfor a stick.   Altogether, seven people were confirmed dead in Texas, four inNorth Carolina, three in Louisiana, two in South Carolina, four inVirginia and one in Oklahoma. More than 100 people were treated forinjuries.   ``The awesome power of these storms is unbelievable,'' said AlWarlick of the North Carolina Department of Crime Control andPublic Safety after he viewed the devastation from a helicopter.``It's simply amazing we don't have more fatalities and injuries.''   Warlick said 41 homes were destroyed and 59 more sustainedsevere damage in the worst-hit areas. He said about 200 people inNorth Carolina were left homeless by the storm. In South Carolina,75 homes were destroyed or damaged, officials said.   The weather eased up Saturday, with only isolated showers and afew thunderstorms in most parts of the Southeast. However, heavyrain, hail and winds up to 75 wind raked North Carolina, downingtrees and power lines and making a difficult job even harder forthose cleaning up. At least two more tornadoes were spotted.   Heavy rain also was reported in New England and the mid-Atlanticstates, while parts of the Midwest were chilled by record lowtemperatures and snow.   Survivors of the Southeast storm recalled how victims weretossed against trees, crushed under houses and sucked intofloodwaters.   J.E. Hoffman, whose sister and brother-in-law died when theirhome collapsed near Toluca, N.C., cried Saturday as he searched forfamily belongings strewn over a two-mile path.   ``This is unbelievable,'' Hoffman said. ``It even peeled thebark off the trees.''   In Chesnee, S.C., George Powell found the body of his next-doorneighbor, Dora Lamb, who was thrown out of her mobile home into apeach orchard when a tornado picked up the house like a toy.   ``She was up against a peach tree with insulation all aroundher,'' Powell said. ``It was the most terrible thing I've everseen. I've never experienced anything like this and hope I neverhave to again.''   Farther north, trees were reported uprooted in parts of northernNew Jersey, and storms in Pennsylvania closed roadways and floodedcreeks. A tornado was reported in Coatesville, Penn., but therewere no reports of damage or injuries.   In Lancaster County, Pa., the storms closed more than 30 roads,washed away one bridge, and trapped several motorists in knee-deepwater, rescue workers said.   In Glen Echo, Md., near Washington, U.S. Park Police worked toretrieve a dozen cars that fell into the Potomoc River and thenearby Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on Friday when heavy rain caused aparking lot to collapse.</TEXT></DOC>
