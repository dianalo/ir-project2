Under the proposal, the Kuwait Investment Office may exchange shares it controls in Rio Tinto, Spain's biggest chemicals company, for a stake in Rio Tinto's fertilizers branch, sources said. The plan would attempt to end the friction that arose following the Kuwait Investment Office's announcement earlier this summer that it had become Rio Tinto's biggest single shareholder and wanted a say in the company's management.    The proposal is being examined in the context of another plan, under which Rio Tinto's fertilizers operations are to be merged with those of Cros S.A., a smaller chemicals firm, to form Fosforico Espanol S.A. </TEXT></DOC>
