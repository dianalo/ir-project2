Asbestos fibersin or under the tracheal epithelium were counted and extent of hyperplasticlesions was ascertained at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week after exposure.Smoke-exposed cultures showed significantly greater numbers of fibersin the epithelium and greater proliferative activity compared to findingsin cultures not exposed to smoke. These observations indicate that veryshort exposure to cigarette smoke can directly affect the response ofthe epithelium to asbestos fibers and that smoke exposure need not beconcurrent with asbestos exposure for such event to occur. These reactionsmay play a role in the greater incidences of lung cancer and asbestosisseen in asbestos-exposed workers who smoke.</TEXT></DOC>
