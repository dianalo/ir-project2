Until 1985, 23,569 wells were drilled, and among them 11,814wells have been developed to productive ones. Most of the structuresof oil and gas fields were formed in connection with the growth of saltdomes and associated faults. Natural gas produced in the Pleistocene,Pliocene, upper Miocene and middle Miocene formations amounts 96 percentof the total production of gas. Crude oil produced in the Pleistocene,Pliocene and upper Miocene formations amounts 94 percent of the totalproduction of oil. Since 1986, the number of drilling wells has decreasedby about 40 percent , being affected by a fall in the price of oil. Theamount of the ultimate minable reserve in the Gulf of Mexico is 45 to50 billion bbl (in petroleum), and more than 20 billion bbl of it hasalready been produced. (23 figs, 7 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
