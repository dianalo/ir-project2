On one side are leading members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, chiefly the Arab producers. On the other are big oil exporters outside the cartel, from the North Sea to Mexico. Each blames the other for the world oil glut. But the bigger argument involves who should take the first steps to brake runaway output.    OPEC's Arab members have been singled out -- unfairly, they say -- for a recent surge in production that trimmed $2 a barrel off prices. A week ago, the Arab producers launched a counterattack in the war of words, with the king of Saudi Arabia firing the first shot.    In an official statement, King Fahd said he had warned about sliding oil prices in urging OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cooperate on production discipline. The king expressed hope that OPEC and non-OPEC countries would take &quot;initative to control the matter before {an} increase in deterioration in the markets.&quot;    Since then, officials at the highest levels of several other Arab members of OPEC -- including the crown princes of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, both noted for producing beyond quotas -- have been particularly blunt in criticizing non-OPEC exporters. On Friday, for example, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed, the chairman of the supreme petroleum council of Abu Dhabi, called on the outside exporters to share in &quot;sacrifices {to} restore stability to the oil market.&quot;    With a $250-billion-a-year crude-oil market at stake, the 13 members of OPEC and eight non-OPEC producing countries tried last spring to agree on joint production cuts. That historic meeting ended in failure because Saudi Arabia, supported by OPEC's other Arab members, rejected the non-OPEC proposal of a 5% cut in exports as too little and too late.    OPEC pledged, however, to leave the door open. And Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister and OPEC's president, has emphasized on several recent occasions the need for more talks.    But Fernando Hiriart-Balderrama, Mexico's energy minister, said late last week he is still waiting to hear from OPEC. &quot;We can't do anything until we get a concrete proposal,&quot; he said. On an official visit to Houston, Mr. Hiriart said he and the other non-OPEC representatives keep in contact and that Mexico still is willing to reduce its exports &quot;on condition of an OPEC reduction significant enough to stabilize world oil markets.&quot;    But, Mr. Hiriart said, &quot;OPEC has to get back to its quotas first&quot; before applying the non-OPEC 5% formula. That would mean, he said, an OPEC output reduction of 1.5 million barrels a day, to an implied ceiling of 17.5 million barrels, on top of the exports cut.    Although Britain's government remains aloof from the argument, British Petroleum Co., a leading North Sea producer, jumped into the fray last week. In the text of a speech released by the company, Robert Horton, a managing director, said OPEC's crude oil output must be reduced to levels &quot;in line with market demand.&quot; Mr. Horton urged that OPEC give &quot;serious thought to holding an emergency meeting&quot; to get on with that task.    Also, Norwegian officials confirmed last week that their oil minister intended to speak to Mr. Lukman regarding reports of overproduction in OPEC. For his part, the OPEC president remains somewhat neutral. Friday, the OPEC news agency quoted him as chastising both OPEC and non-OPEC suppliers for lack of restraint. </TEXT></DOC>
