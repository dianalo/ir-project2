(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mayor has asked the state to reviewthe Police Department's investigation of a landlady accused ofkilling her elderly tenants and burying seven bodies in the yard ofher Victorian boardinghouse.   After finding the first body and interviewing Dorothea MontalvoPuente, 59, police released her, citing a lack of evidence. She wasarrested five days later in Los Angeles following a search inCalifornia, Nevada and Mexico.   Officers then flew her back to Sacramento aboard a planechartered by a TV station, which interviewed her en route.   ``I want to see if any of our policies or procedures need to betightened up,'' Mayor Anne Rudin said Tuesday. ``There are obviouslysome gaps, especially the two major gaps.''   Police Chief John Kearns agreed to the review by the stateCommission on Peace Officer Standards and Training.   ``I think it's a positive step, not a negative one. ... We are apublic agency open to scrutiny,'' he said.   Meanwhile, Sacramento County Coroner Charles Simmons said one ofthe seven bodies was that of a woman, 50 to 60 years old, and wasthe only one found on the grounds of the boardinghouse thatsustained ``obvious physical trauma.''   ``It was missing the feet and hands and head,'' Simmons said.``We don't know if the mutilation occurred before or after death.''   Puente, who ran the two-story home, has been charged with onecount of murder in the death of Alvaro ``Bert'' Montoya, a mentallyhandicapped transient and former tenant missing for months fromPuente's home.   Prosecutors were considering additional counts, said policespokesman Sgt. Bob Burns. She has denied the murder charge.   Simmons, who announced that his office has completed autopsies onthe seven bodies, said none of the victims matched Montoya'sdescription.   ``But some of them were very decomposed,'' he said. Only one ofthe bodies has been identified and the cause of their deaths isunknown.   James Beede, a toxicologist with the coroner's office, saidauthorities were hunting for evidence of poison as a cause of death,but declined to provide specifics.   Police believe the victims were tenants of the boardinghouse andmay have been killed for their Social Security benefits.   The sole body identified is that of 55-year-old Benjamin Fink,described by his family as a chronic alcoholic and transient whomoved into Puente's home earlier this year.   According to documents filed in municipal court, another boardertold police that Fink disappeared after he became drunk and``Dorothea told him that she would take him upstairs and make himfeel better.''</TEXT></DOC>
