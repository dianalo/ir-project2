(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman trying to convince authorities thather ex-husband sexually abused their daughter has been offered helpby two people who say they were molested by him years ago.   Jesse Murabito, 40, fled with her two children after her formerhusband, Mark Russell Murabito, was acquitted in November of chargesthat he sexually assaulted his daughter. In 1987, the judge in thecouple's divorce heard a week of testimony before rejecting similarallegations.   Now, Brett Spaulding, 23, of Fort Myers, Fla., and ElisaRobinson, 26, of Groton, Conn., say they were sexually molested byMurabito as children when they lived with their families at areligious community in Epping.   Asked to comment on the allegations, Murabito's lawyer, RaymondKellett, called them slanderous and ``another case of Jesse tryingto introduce sensationalism to the case.''   Murabito referred all questions to Kellett.   Murabito, 34, of Derry received joint custody with the state ofhis daughter, 6, and son, 4, after Mrs. Murabito went undergroundwith the children. They were found in Montana earlier this month andthe children are in foster care at an undisclosed location in NewHampshire.   Spaulding said he was 5 years old when Mark Murabito, then about16, sexually abused him on the grounds of Green Pastures communityof the Emissaries of Divine Light church in Epping.   ``I remember everyone else was going to dinner when `Rusty'(Murabito) called me by my first name,'' Spaulding said in atelephone interview from Fort Myers. ``I went over and he pulled meby the hair and took me into a hall and wouldn't let me leave. Hemade me have oral sex with him.''   Spaulding said he doesn't remember much more. His mother, AliceSpaulding, 60, said her son described the alleged sex act to herafter he returned home late that day.   Spaulding said he and his parents put the incident behind themand didn't think of it until a friend of his mother's visiting fromNew Hampshire brought them a newspaper article on the Murabitos'case. The case made national news two years ago when Mrs. Murabitohid the children and went to jail for a week rather than let themvisit their father.   He said he decided to come forward because he didn't want thesame thing to happen to someone else.   Robinson said Murabito molested her when she was about 8 yearsold.   ``Rusty was the baby sitter one night when the adults were at thechapel,'' Robinson said in a telephone interview from Groton. ``Iwas supposed to be asleep but had been reading a book when I heardRusty coming up the stairs.   ``I put the book down and pretended to be asleep,'' she said.``He sat on the edge of the bed, pulled the cover down, and pulledmy underwear down. Then he sat and stared at my crotch for a while.''   Robinson said she felt ``very uncomfortable and embarrassed''afterward.   Unlike the Spauldings and Robinson and her mother, Murabito andhis family did not live at the religious community, but went toGreen Pastures for church services and functions.   Robinson said she kept silent about the incident for 10 yearsbefore telling her mother. Robinson said she followed the Murabitocase in the news and became interested in it when she moved toExeter briefly last year while Murabito's felonious sexual assaulttrial was in progress.   Robinson said she wanted to testify against Murabito at thetrial, but Rockingham County Superior Court Judge Robert Templewouldn't allow it. County Attorney Carleton Eldredge said the judgewould not let her take the stand because Murabito's prior behaviorhad no bearing on the case.   Eldredge said he considers Robinson credible and believes herstory.   Mrs. Spaulding said she and her husband told church authoritiesabout the incident and that Murabito wasn't allowed on the farm fora long time.   Tom Starrs, a spokesman for Green Pastures, said he knew nothingabout Spaulding's claims. He said the church officials who ran GreenPastures at the time are dead and the church kept no records thatcould document the story.   ``I never heard anything of it before and would find it hard tobelieve. He (Murabito) is a fine person,'' said Starrs.</TEXT></DOC>
