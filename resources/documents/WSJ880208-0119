In the U.S. it costs about $3 (75 kopeks in the Soviet Union). The capitalist English-language edition of Harper andamp; Row sets you back $19.95.    There are other differences. In the Soviet version, Mikhail Gorbachev's picture is on the front cover; in the American one it's on the back. (But in the spirit of glasnost, the Soviets use the same unretouched photograph.) In the Soviet edition, quotations from Marx, Engels and Lenin are footnoted; the American reader has to take their accuracy on trust.    Harper has printed 200,000 copies of &quot;Perestroika.&quot; The Soviet publisher, Politizdat, will print 300,000 copies. By Soviet standards, that's a token number. The first printing of Mr. Gorbachev's Nov. 2 speech on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, &quot;October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues,&quot; was three million copies.    Some things were lost (or gained) in translation. Most of these errors are minor. (In the American edition, the process of perestroika will be &quot;tedious&quot; instead of &quot;painstaking.&quot;) But there is at least one mistranslation that seriously distorts Mr. Gorbachev's intended meaning. In the Harper andamp; Row version Mr. Gorbachev writes, &quot;Probably the most hackneyed statement by a Soviet leader in the West is the angry exclamation by Nikita Khrushchev: 'We will bury you!'&quot; This creates the impression that Mr. Gorbachev is criticizing Khrushchev.    Actually, Mr. Gorbachev was taking anti-Soviet Westerners, not Khrushchev, to task. A correct translation would read: &quot;Perhaps the statement of a Soviet leader that has been most overused in the West is Khrushchev's angry exclamation . . .&quot; Mr. Gorbachev does go on to say that Khrushchev's use of the phrase was &quot;unfortunate in all respects,&quot; but the mistranslation makes his criticism seem much harsher than it actually is.    While most of the boilerplate makes the transition to English intact, the translator often alters stock Soviet phrases, perhaps in an effort to make them more digestible. Mr. Gorbachev writes that the social safety net is a major achievement, but &quot;on the other hand, it makes some people spongers.&quot; A literal translation would read, &quot;on the other hand, in the consciousness of some people {the social safety net} resulted in parasitic tendencies.&quot;    The Russian rhetoric connotes not just the existence of individual &quot;parasites&quot; but of a dangerous social group whose consciousness needs to be changed. (Elsewhere in the book, where this phrase is correctly translated, Mr. Gorbachev adds that these tendencies are &quot;alien to socialism,&quot; another key Soviet buzz-phrase.)    In the English version, Mr. Gorbachev writes that the Communist Party began the process of &quot;restructuring&quot; the Soviet Union with its own &quot;self-improvement.&quot; In the original, the word used is &quot;self-cleansing,&quot; a term with deep roots in Communist Party lexicon.    Mr. Gorbachev quotes a letter he received from a &quot;devout Catholic&quot; who writes: &quot;Every day I pray that God refrain from punishing the world for our sins and I want you to know that every Sunday I am in church from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. praying for you and your family.&quot; The Soviet version is the same, except that the man believes not in &quot;God&quot; but &quot;god&quot; (the post-1917 Soviet orthographic norm). And, in accordance with Russian epistolary etiquette, he prays for &quot;You and Your family.&quot;    In the English version, Mr. Gorbachev accuses Khrushchev of trying to implement &quot;willful ideas.&quot; But the Russian text reads &quot;voluntarist ideas,&quot; a characteristic Soviet epithet. This may be just as well; for the Soviet reader, such terms of abuse probably have lost all real meaning after 70 years of repetition.    Khrushchev, Stalin and Trotsky were all guilty of &quot;subjectivism&quot; and its twin phenomenon &quot;voluntarism,&quot; which are defined as the neglect of strictures imposed by &quot;objective historical processes.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev accuses Brezhnev of encouraging &quot;subjectivist assessments.&quot; If Mr. Gorbachev falls, no doubt he, too, will be accused of &quot;subjectivism,&quot; &quot;voluntarism&quot; and perhaps even &quot;empiricism.&quot;    In both versions of &quot;Perestroika&quot; Mr. Gorbachev categorically asserts that, like Soviet socialism itself, the process of reform is &quot;irreversible.&quot; The consensus among Sovietologists is that, at least in the short term, Mr. Gorbachev's position is secure. So there is a chance that he will not suffer the fate of Khrushchev -- god willing.    ---   Mr. Levin was a consultant to CBS News for the December summit. </TEXT></DOC>
