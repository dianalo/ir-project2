PAUL, Minn. -- Northwest Airlines said it will beginoffering Amsterdam service from Minneapolis-St. Paul on KLM'sjets.   Northwest called the move its first major cooperativeventure with KLM since the Dutch carrier participated in a$3.65 billion buy-out of Northwest's parent, NWA Inc., inAugust 1989. KLM invested $400 million.</LP><TEXT>   KLM is letting Northwest sell a block of seats on theBoeing 747-400 jumbo jets KLM flies twice each week toAmsterdam from Minneapolis-St. Paul, starting April 2. Thejets will have KLM's logo, but the service will be listed inthe industry's computer reservation systems under both theKLM and Northwest names.   Northwest said the number of flights will increase tothree times weekly starting June 18, when business from thepeak summer season should begin picking up.   Northwest said the flights are subject to governmentapproval. KLM's equity stake is likely to spawn other jointventures by the two airlines -- something the U.S. is likelyto watch carefully. The government is concerned thatinvestments by foreign airlines could lead to too much sayover a U.S. airline's business.   In January, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinnerpermitted KLM to retain its large stake in NWA after rulingthat he would significantly relax restrictions on foreigninvestment in U.S. airlines by allowing equity stakes of 49%rather than 25%. Foreign ownership of voting stock is stilllimited to 25%.</TEXT></DOC>
