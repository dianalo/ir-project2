Mr. Mishari, who also chairs the project's steering committee, said the consortium will be called Arab Aviation Finance Co. and will be inaugurated in 1989. In an interview, he said the group was selecting a consulting firm to conduct a feasibility study.    Aviation sources in the Persian Gulf said most of Arab aircraft purchases in the coming decade will be from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two companies already were lobbying steering-committee members about the sale. </TEXT></DOC>
