all can run on asingle RT.It needs AIX 2.2.1, C and AIX/NFS Network File System on the RT,plus the Sybase relational database manager.TaskStation is a set ofcustomisable routines for image management, making use of multi-tasking onthe personal computer.It provides the user interface to ImageSystem and givesthe personal computer user the ability to perform applications-specificfunctions that involve folder inquiry and browsing, image viewing andmanipulation, data entry and mainframe communications.Folders can be indexed,classified, reviewed and manipulated.A personal computer can accept work fromCentralStation, request images from folders stored on CentralStation, ordirect output to a peripheral device - and the code can also be integratedwith existing mainframe applications.TaskStation is preconfigured, and can begenerated in four modes of operation - inquiry, indexing, data entry andrepair.Inquiry mode is used to retrieve and display stored images, and hasthe capability to zoom and rotate images, and to append information tothem.In indexing, data entry and repair modes, TaskStation receives documentsthat were not automatically indexed by ScanStation or OCRStation, so that theoperator can complete the indexing or data entry operations manually.Lowspeed document scanning and image printing are also supported onTaskStation.It comes as source code for the basic TaskStation functions, pluslibraries of callable routines that provide image, data and queue managementfunctions, and can be used to customise TaskStation, and enable users tointegrate it with existing application systems.There is also a prepackagedversionandP;, DeliveryStation, customised to provide images of delivery slips orbills of lading for proof-of-delivery or invoice documentation, and optimisedto manage delivery receipts kept in image format.An 80386-based PS/2 isrecommended for TaskStation, but some peripherals required for imageconfigurations need an AT-bus machine.It requires at least 3Mb memory, and ahigh resolution monitor is recommended; VGA is also supported, and may beadequate for images smaller than a full page.Operating system required isMS-DOS 3.3 with C andMicrosoft Windows.Subsets of TaskStation are supportedon 80286-based processors, but without the windowing and multitaskingcapabilities.andP;  ScanStation provides the software for unattended capturing ofimages for ImageSystem, and supports a variety of high speed scanners,compressing the resulting images; an optional barcode recognition featurelocates and interprets any barcodes and uses them to create an image indexautomatically.andP;  All images not automatically indexed are passed toCentralStation for indexing at another station.andP;  ScanStation supports theoptional OCR function by providing a facility to mark documents under programcontrol for subsequent routing to OCRStation.andP;  OCRStation is an optionalcomponent that creates an optical character recognition server in ImageSysemapplications.It includes the capability to define fields on forms, whichenables the use of optical character recognition in data entry.It enablesusers to translate information from typewritten or computer printed formsinto machine-readable text which can then be managed by ImageSystem forindexing purposes, and integrated with mainframe applications.Form-specific,intelligent post-processing allows for field translation to facilitateintegration with mainframe applications.Users can define new forms at anytime and a rule definition interface enables rules to be specified forinterpretation and validation of data on the form.And DeviceStation providessupport for peripheral functions, such as batch image printing, and forfacsimile input from phone lines.Facsimile output can be sent over phonelines to devices capable of receiving it.An 80286-based AT-alike runningMS-DOS 3.3 is good enough for the ScanStation, OCRStation and DeviceStation;CCITT Group III or IV or IBM MMR compression are supported on ScanStation.andO;CentralStation is a one-time $25,000; Jukebox Support is $10,000; MainframeCommunication Support $5,000; TaskStation is $1,500; ScanStation $12,500;Barcode Recognition Software $11,000; OCRStation, $12,500; DeviceStation,$1,500; and DeliveryStation $10,000.All will be available in the US June 23.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
