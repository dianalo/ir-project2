Thestudy embraces two main methodologies, namely: the systematic calculationof the risk impacts of the energy system to human health and to the environment,and the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of risk reduction schemes.The Tiwi Geothermal Power Plant was used as the reference energy system.A model for atmospheric dispersion was developed and used to estimatethe concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H/sub 2/S) at various locations.H/sub 2/S is one of the gas effluents of a geothermal power plant andis widely believed to pose a major environmental and health hazard. Theestimated dose values were used to calculate the dose rate levels ofthe population in the area. The direct effect of H/sub 2/S was also evaluated.Various H/sub 2/S reduction schemes were analyzed from the cost-effectivenesspoint of view, and alternative measures were considered to meet the permissiblerisk level. Experiences gathered from the study led to the formulationof an organized approach regarding the various factors which are involvedin effective risk management studies. These factors are (1) adequatepersonnel training on project methodologies, and systematic data collection,handling and treatments; (2) establishment of linkages with cooperatinginstitutions/agencies for supplementary data and information; (3) useof up-to-date and site-related data (for this study, site related datawas confined to the application of data of proximate areas having similarmeteorological characteristics to the site); (4) development of a flexiblemodel adapted to local conditions/situations; and (5) use of computercodes for documentation of the methods used in the computations. 11 refs,2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
