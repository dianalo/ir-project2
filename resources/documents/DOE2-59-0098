<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0098 </DOCNO><TEXT>In anticipation of the national Underground Storage Tank (UST) regulations,the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) developed a comprehensivemanagement program for USTs. Principle requirements of the proposed regulationsthat will impact INEL operations are that existing storage tanks willneed to be upgraded to new technical standards; new storage tanks willhave to meet new technical standards; all storage tanks will requirethe implementation of more complex operations, record keeping and managementplans; and responses to spills and leaks will involve compliance withregulations, including RCRA, CERCLA and SARA for reporting and correctiveaction. The purpose of the INEL UST management program is to ensure progresstoward compliance while minimizing costs and impacts to on-site operationsinvolving tanks. The program considers UST standards for new tank design,construction, installation, operation, maintenance, replacement and recordkeeping. It focuses on obtaining pertinent data and developing a methodto assess the probability of tank failure, determine risks from tankreleases, and prioritizing tanks for upgrading to new performance standardsor replacement. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
