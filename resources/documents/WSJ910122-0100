In that instant, the Patriot went from an untested symbolof cost overruns and Pentagon waste that was nearly scrappedby Congress, to a heroic vindication of expensive high-techweaponry. Yesterday, nine more Iraqi Scud missiles were shotdown over Saudi Arabia by Patriots.</LP><TEXT>   The riveting footage of the Patriot's success was airedrepeatedly over the weekend on all the broadcast networks andCNN, along with equally spectacular images of other weaponsin the high-tech arsenal: the Tomahawk cruise missile,hovering in a neon glow before streaking away from U.S.battleships, and the Stealth, zeroing in on a Baghdadcommunications tower that suddenly implodes.   After years of being portrayed as cheaters and bunglers,the corporate giants behind the biggest peacetime militarybuildup in history finally have something to crow about. AtMcDonnell Douglas Corp.'s jet-fighter plant in St. Louis,ebullient workers who build F-15s and F/A-18s have taken tocalling the relentless U.S.-led bombardment of Iraq &quot;the BigMac Attack.&quot;   At General Dynamics Corp., the Pentagon's rave reviews ofthe Tomahawk have instilled the same sort of pride. &quot;Ifyou've got to go to war, you ought to do so with some bulletsin your belt that can hit the target,&quot; says Brad Beaver,director of Tomahawk programs at the company's factory in SanDiego, where the cruise missiles are assembled.   &quot;What's going on says a lot for technology,&quot; adds BenRich, designer of the radar-evading F-117A Stealth fighter, aproduct of Lockheed Corp.'s legendary &quot;Skunk Works&quot; facility.&quot;I feel very gratified that the plane is doing the job it'ssupposed to do.&quot;   Yet the impact of the opening days of the Gulf war for thenation's high-tech defense contractors goes far beyondmorale. The now-demonstrated efficacy of some of the mostexpensive and sophisticated weaponry in the U.S.armamentarium is likely to have a profound impact on howmilitary spending is allocated. Even if overall defensespending remains flat or shrinks, more money is likely toflow to the high-tech sector, including the much-derided&quot;Star Wars&quot; program, which could enhance the bottom lines ofdefense contractors best positioned to benefit.   Raytheon may be the best example. The Patriot accountedfor 15% of the Lexington, Mass., company's total revenue of$8.8 billion in 1989, and demand, already strong, is nowlikely to soar for the $700,000 weapon. Saudi Arabia hasalready requested, on an emergency basis, an additional 18 to20 Patriots, an order valued at $1.1 billion. At the end of1989, Raytheon had an order backlog for Patriots of $2.1billion, and its manufacturing facilities are now operatinground the clock.   In the past six years, Raytheon has sold about $7 billionin Patriot systems to the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands andJapan. Italy already has agreed to buy the Patriot but hasn'tfinanced the purchase. Turkish President Turgut Ozal saidlast week that he wanted the system. The Patriot's successcould also mean added sales to Britain, which has to choosefrom among several air-defense systems.   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst for KemperSecurities Group, says missiles and bombs repeatedly employedby the Allies will have to be replaced. High on the list, hesays, are Rockwell International Corp.'s GBU-15 and theMaverick, made by Raytheon and Hughes Aircraft division ofGeneral Motors Corp. The Tomahawk, built by General Dynamicsand McDonnell Douglas, is another likely winner. The Navy hadplanned to stop buying Tomahawks after 1992, but that couldwell change.   How much of an immediate boon this will be is uncertain,though. For instance, the Tomahawk accounts for only about 2%of General Dynamics' revenue and even less of McDonnellDouglas's. To this point, about 2,000 of the missiles havebeen delivered, with another 2,000 or so already on order. &quot;Alot of the equipment in the Gulf was supposed to take on amuch bigger force,&quot; says Thomas Culligan, McDonnell Douglas'svice president for program development and marketing, withreference to the Soviets. &quot;There is a lot of inventory outthere.&quot;   There is even talk around the industry fighter line, andof the Navy's using the plane as a basis for itsnext-generation attack jet in the wake of the recentcancellation of the A-12. The company, while saying it isn'tin any discussions with the Navy, acknowledges that it is innegotiations with the Air Force for possible modification andfollow-up work on the F-117A line. But, again, the immediatefinancial impact to Lockheed could be relatively slight. ThePentagon belatedly disclosed that it had spent $6.26 billionover nine years to acquire 59 Stealth fighters, butLockheed's business base was so big that analysts never couldreally pick out how much of a contribution it was making tothe company's sales level while the plane was being built.   The overall effect on the companies' fiscal performance,then, is bound to come in dribs and drabs across the board.Early returns from the war zone are already reshaping thedebate over &quot;smart&quot; munitions and other electronic gadgetry,which critics had dismissed as too complex to use in the heatof battle. The initial success of much of the high-techhardware could well strengthen the hand of the defenseindustry with Congress in future budget negotiations.   Rep. Lee Hamilton expects the Gulf war to give a &quot;strongpush&quot; to the defense lobby's efforts to fend off projectedcuts in weapons spending. Because of the aerial spectacularover Iraq, &quot;Congress will be more receptive now to this hightechnology,&quot; the Indiana Democrat predicted on NBC's Meet thePress yesterday. Sam Nunn, Democratic chairman of the SenateArmed Services Committee, told CNN: &quot;I think every now andthen we ought to praise our defense industry out there. Theyget a lot of knocks, but they've developed a tremendousamount of technology that's saving precious American lives.&quot;   All of these sentiments assume, of course, that technologycontinues to serve the U.S. well in the Persian Gulf as thewar with Iraq progresses. Information continues to be sketchyon the success rate of weapons systems, and the DefenseDepartment is highly selective in releasing videotape ofsorties.   &quot;I'd be very cautious about drawing any final judgments,&quot;says military analyst Jeffrey Record. &quot;It's nice to watchvideos of the direct hits. But we haven't been shown themisses.&quot; Soon after the U.S. invasion of Panama in December1989, Stealth fighters were praised for a flawlessperformance -- even though it was later disclosed that oneStealth-borne bomb had missed its target by more than 100yards.   Nonetheless, arms makers couldn't have scripted a betterfirst few days of war for showing off their engineeringfeats. Fifty-one of the first 52 Tomahawks, the Pentagonsays, were bull's-eyes. The cruise missile's path ispredetermined by a digitized reference map stored inside acomputer processor. A zoom lens and electronic sensors keepit on course as it glides along at high-subsonic speeds,hugging the terrain.   Along with the Stealth fighters, Tomahawks were apparentlyable to knock out much of Iraq's most formidableanti-aircraft defenses in the first hours of the war. This isevidently one of the reasons that, as of yesterday, after7,000 sorties, only a handful of U.S. aircraft had been shotdown.   The Stealth uses specially coated surfaces and its ownelectronics to distort radar beams and thus evade enemy fire.The major ordnance it carries, while classified, is believedto be the Paveway III, a laser-guided &quot;smart&quot; bombmanufactured by Texas Instruments Inc.   Other U.S. aircraft besides the Stealth fighter arecrammed with electronics, which probably is the reason fortheir high survival rate. Loral, Hughes Aircraft, NorthropCorp. and others build systems that allow a pilot todetermine instantly when an enemy radar has locked onto hisplane -- and then counter it.   Certain planes, such as special General Dynamics F-111sthat have had their electronic innards reworked by GrummanCorp. and Grumman EA-6Bs, are specifically designed to foilenemy radar. And Martin Marietta Corp. has furnished the mostadvanced versions of the F-15 and F-16 with &quot;forward-lookinginfrared&quot; sensors, or FLIRs, that provide a TV-like visualimage of the terrain in front of the aircraft, even at night.   Coordinating all this technology is Boeing Co.'s E-3Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, and asatellite constellation, known as Navstar, manufactured byRockwell International Corp.   In the long run, though, perhaps no piece of technologywill prove more important to the success of Desert Storm thanthe Patriot system, which originally was designed to shootdown airplanes but was modified just last August to knockdown incoming tactical ballistic missiles such as the Scud.   Over the weekend, the U.S. sent Israel several batteriesof Patriots, which will be manned by Americans. (The Israelisare not yet fully trained to use them.) The Patriot is beinghailed as one reason Israel didn't retaliate immediately forIraqi missile strikes.   Should the Patriot continue to prove itself, Raytheon isdestined to receive many more orders from other countrieslooking for similar protection. &quot;They're going to sell a lotof these hummers,&quot; predicts Lawrence Korb, an assistantdefense secretary in the Reagan administration, who is nowwith the Brookings Institution.   But, ultimately, it is the deeper, more fundamental issuesthat will emerge from the Gulf war that stand to determinethe fortunes of defense contractors. Some analysts believe,for instance, that Congress may grow somewhat more tolerantof problems encountered in the development of complicatedweapons systems, given that many of today's heroes wereyesterday's goats.   The Patriot, for instance, wasn't deployed until 1985, atleast six years behind schedule, more than $2 billion overbudget and plagued with so many misfires and misses in earlytests that it nearly was destroyed politically. The Tomahawkalso flew wildly early on, once setting a brush fire in anational forest. Texas Instruments's HARM missile, whichindustry insiders believe has been essential in helping wipeout Iraqi radar, was identified by the General AccountingOffice in 1987 as one of four Navy missiles havingpotentially serious defects.   &quot;There are a lot of grandstanders in Congress who want toget rid of all this high-tech stuff,&quot; says John Lehman,former Navy secretary and now a director at PaineWebber Inc.&quot;They want to make it so everything seems like a basketcase.&quot;   That will be tougher to do in the future. But at the sametime, some believe America's powerful showing in Iraq to dateprovides an argument for spending less money on new weapons.Why do we need $850 million-a-pop B-2 bombers, the argumentgoes, when Tomahawk cruise missiles can clear the way and30-year-old B-52s can deliver some of the most devastatingblows against the world's fifth largest army? Likewise, doesthe U.S. really need an Advanced Tactical Fighter, the AirForce's big development program, when F-15s have proved soable?   Nonetheless, the debate has already shifted from whetherthe nation needs high-tech weapons to which ones it needs.&quot;The taxpayer is really getting his money's worth now,&quot;maintains Ralph Hawes, executive vice president of GeneralDynamics's missiles and electronics division. &quot;None of uslike to think we build things that kill people. But we'repretty damn proud of the fact that when the country needs oursystems, they work right.&quot;   ---             America's High-Technology Arsenal                                                                                                          TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILE                                                                                                          Description: The Navy's version of this missile can belaunched from submarines or surface vessels.
