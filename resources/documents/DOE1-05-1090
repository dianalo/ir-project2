Beginningwith an introduction to the atmospheric chemistry of acid rain for thelayperson, the book follows up with a look at the answers to these questionsof imminent concern to both scientists and policy makers. Does a source-receptorrelationship actually exist? What is the supporting evidence? Why isan understanding of the source-receptor relationship crucial for understandingthe impacts of acid deposition on the environment? How can source-receptorrelationships be used to develop control strategies and near-term optionsfor acid rain mitigation? What are the areas of consensus on the source-receptorrelationship issue? What are the areas of dissension, and how can thesebe resolved responsibly? What kind of criteria is the U.S. Congress usingto draft control legislation?</TEXT></DOC>
