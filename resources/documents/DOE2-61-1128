Thefirst technique involves exciting the transition with a laser pulse thatis nearly time-bandwidth limited, of uniform intensity, and has a reproducibleshape from shot to shot. The population left in the excited state afterthe pulse varies sinusoidally with a period that depends on the integralover time of the electric field amplitude and the transition oscillatorstrength. These are the Rabi oscillations that are predicted by applicationof the Schrodinger equation to the two-level atom. The excited-statepopulation is probed using a two-step photoionization to the continuum.The electric field amplitude is determined from the temporal profileand the intensity of the laser pulse. The second method involves observationof the polarization rotation of a set of degenerate sublevels broughtabout by a time-bandwidth limited light-shift laser. One sublevel (m{subj} = 0) of the J = 1 level at 17992 cm{sup {minus}1} is populated bya linearly polarized laser. A second copropagating light-shift laser,which is linearly polarized at an angle to the first laser, is tunedbetween 7.5 and 30 GHz off-resonance with the transition. The light-shiftlaser causes population to be promoted into the m{sub j} = {plus_minus}1levels by a virtual transition through the ground J = O, m{sub j} = Olevel. Two linearly polarized photoionizing lasers photoionize the populationonly from the m{sub j} = {plus_minus}1 levels. The photoion signal oscillatessinusoidally with a period that depends only on the integrated pulseintensity, the laser detuning, and the transition oscillator strength.5 refs., 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
