The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their firstglance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into thecapital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movementfor political change.   Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for cityresidents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeksstood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclists today wereallowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge ofthe square.   The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by atread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When students built thestatue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movementfor democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. On Sundaymorning, a tank crushed it.   In all, 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined thenorthern part of the square.   The Monument to Revolutionary Martyrs, where the students took afinal stand early Sunday, was swept clean. Poems and posters callingfor a more open China have disappeared from its sides.   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students'organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany. Thegovernment says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed;diplomats and Chinese say up to 3,000 died.   Soldiers drilled in Tiananmen's center, their cadenced shoutingechoing around the vast expanse. A crowd of officials stood on theroof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square. Fromthis same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilantmass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entryto the square.   Inside the square, soldiers could be seen shuffling about, theiruniformed jackets stripped off, wash basins in hand. There was arelaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troopscarried food and walked slowly together, talking and laughing ingroups.   The area once housing students' tents has become a holding areafor a huge fleet of troop trucks.   On the southern perimeter, a single line of tanks and a cordon ofsoldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists whopedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen.   Near the square, troops placed barbed wire in front of onestreet. Soldiers were billeted in a construction site, theirlaundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding. Next door, troops,their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders, stoodand chatted outside a discotheque.   ``They look like they ,'' said one local resident. ``I hope theyknow that we still don't want them here.''</TEXT></DOC>
