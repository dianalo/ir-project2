The army command said a combined force of tanks, artillery andthe elite infantry unit Givati hit its targets and returned safely.It had no information on possible Hezbollah casualties.   The army said the bases were near Jaba, Kfar Milki and MazraatAyn Abu Siwar, from five to eight miles west of the Christian townof Jezzine and about 12 miles from the northern tip of Israel'sself-proclaimed buffer zone. The area is controlled by theIsraeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.   The army said the bases were used ``for organizing and launchingattacks'' against Israeli troops and the SLA.
