His policy is an embarrassment as Iraqi dissidents arecrushed. &quot;We're back to the old George Bush who is a lot morecomfortable dealing with chiefs of state than with rebels,&quot;charges Ann Lewis, a Democratic consultant who backed Bush onthe war. GOP analyst Kevin Phillips predicts Bush's policy&quot;will speed his decline in the polls, albeit from a very highstarting level.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Bush advisers argue that Americans' distaste forinvolvement in Iraq's internal morass outweighs sympathiesfor the rebels. GOP pollster Richard Reed suspects anotherreason officials wish to hold back: &quot;I don't think they wantto tamper with consumer optimism&quot; that has surged after thewar. Calls for tougher action by Democrats who opposed thewar are seen as hypocritical.   Israel's hard-line signals against compromise on thePalestinian issue pose more problems for Bush. &quot;People in theArab world are saying, `What is America doing?'&quot; one Arabambassador says.                                                                                                          A STANDOFF over a payroll tax cut could block any tax billthis year.   House Democratic leaders, who oppose the Social Securitytax cut, may stall all tax legislation to which the proposalcould be attached. Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen alsoresists the tax cut, fearing Democrats would be accused ofundermining the Social Security system. Bush aides say theywon't hesitate to make that argument.   But backers of popular tax breaks for research, low-incomehousing, mortgage bonds and hiring disadvantaged workers, allof which expire Dec. 31, press for a tax bill this year.House Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski also wants to pushtax simplification. And Bentsen's pet project, expanded taxbreaks for individual savers, can't move without some sort oftax bill.                                                                                                          BASE CLOSINGS loom in coming defense cuts, but facelawmakers' protests.   Defense chief Cheney will propose closing or reducing morethan 100 facilities worldwide. The military, for the firsttime, backs such cuts to save limited resources for troopsand equipment. Top candidates: major naval bases inPhiladelphia and on the West Coast, the Army's Fort Ord inCalifornia and Fort Sheridan in Illinois, and Air Force basesin Texas and California.   Some lawmakers who support base cuts argue to retain thosein their own states. Liberal Massachusetts Rep. Moakley willoppose any plan that axes Fort Devens near Boston. Texas Sen.Bentsen defends Fort Bliss, the home of Patriot air-defensetraining. Cheney also is likely to stir controversy byproposing to close some local Corps of Engineers offices.   A nonpartisan commission can amend Cheney's list, whichCongress and the White House would then have to approve as apackage.                                                                                                          SHRINKING SPILL: U.S. officials quietly downgrade theIraqi-caused oil spill in the Persian Gulf to about the sixthbiggest on record and not even the worst ever in the Gulf.U.S. and Saudi officials originally portrayed the spill asthe largest ever.                                                                                                          NO LAME BYRD: West Virginia Sen. Byrd, 73 years old,already starts raising money to run for re-election in 1994.The move is seen as a signal not to assume that he willretire and that he instead intends to hold onto his key postas Senate Appropriations Committee chairman.                                                                                                          TREASURY'S PROPOSAL for banking reform gets off to a rockystart. Small bankers launch a Main Street Coalition to fightthe plan as benefiting Wall Street interests. Even WhiteHouse Chief of Staff Sununu, to the ire of Treasury SecretaryBrady, publicly predicts that reform won't pass Congress thisyear.                                                                                                          AGREEMENT NEARS on retaining U.S. bases in the Philippinesafter more than a year of negotiations. The only major hitchisn't the amount of U.S. aid, which isn't expected to exceedthe current $520 million a year, but whether some of thefunds can be used as collateral for a $3 billion bond issueto reduce Philippine debt.                                                                                                          DONATIONS DRY UP at conservative political-actioncommittees.   Drastic declines are reported in federal filings by 10conservative PACs for the 1990 election cycle. Theonce-mighty Fund for a Conservative Majority and the NationalConservative Political Action Committee totter on the brinkof extinction. Conservatives attribute the decline partly tothe fading away of Reagan, their most potent fund-raisingsymbol.   &quot;There's just not the intensity or degree of activity onthe right,&quot; says GOP political consultant Craig Shirley. EvenNorth Carolina Sen. Helms's National Congress Club took innearly $602,000 less than in 1988. And the National RifleAssociation's Political Victory Fund slipped by about$938,000.   But while the National Right to Life's PAC lagged by$380,000, donations to the National Abortion Rights Action'sPAC nearly doubled, to more than $1 million.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Time to reprogram? Computer models at thePentagon's office of program analysis still predict that ifthe U.S. invaded Iraq, it would be defeated by the tank-heavyIraqi army's superior firepower. . . . A paper at a meetingof the Population Association of America is entitled, &quot;Nottonight, dear: Pregnancy intentions, contraceptive choice andconjugal harmony.&quot; . . . GOP Rep. Crane of Illinoisintroduces a bill to limit House members to three terms;Crane is in his 11th term.</TEXT></DOC>
