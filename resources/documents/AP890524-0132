They plan to keep working for reforms, such as a free press andan end to widespread official corruption, regardless of whetherCommunist Party reformers win a power struggle with conservatives.   ``If we get our immediate goals _ including a dialogue with thegovernment _ we will calm down a bit and be able to study. But ourmovement won't be over,'' said Chen Zhangbao, an activist atBeijing Normal University.   On his and other Beijing campuses, students who did not join orwho left the 12-day-old Tiananmen sit-in were collecting suppliesfor the students in the square, printing leaflets and speading wordon the streets of their reform movement.   Some read announcements and speeches into loudspeaker networksthat now extend off-campus. Others kept an eye on the movements oftroops who were ordered Saturday to impose martial law in the citycenter but were blocked on the outskirts by crowds of students andsupporters.   Some students worked shifts on traffic control units around thesquare. Some made posters.   What the students weren't doing was going to class.   ``We're still studying on our own, but ... we're pretty busyworking for the movement,'' said Chen, a Chinese literature majorwho admits he hasn't cracked a book in a while.   Chen works in his campus' ``propaganda department'' of whatstudents have come to call simply ``the movement'' _ short for``the patriotic student democracy movement.''   Each campus also has a secretariat, logistics department andreception department for greeting out-of-town students coming toBeijing to join the movement.   One big project has been organizing four teams of about 500students each from Beijing Normal University to take turns sittingin the square for 12-hour shifts, Chen said. Other schools haveorganized similar teams.   ``We have to ensure that the students get some rest,'' he said.``The government could delay for several weeks'' in responding tostudent terms for leaving the square: the resignation of Premier LiPeng, an end to martial law and a dialogue with the government onreform.   The hall in Chen's dormitory is piled with food and clothingdonated by local residents for the protesters in the square. Thesit-in began May 13 with a hunger strike by about 2,000 students,grew to include about 70,000 students and thousands moresupporters, then shrank over the weekend after the hunger strikeended.   The students plan to continue the sit-in to dramatize theirdemands, but say it is not their only focus.   Thousands have volunteered to go to factories and residentialareas to hand out leaflets and lead political discussions.   ``We want to reach as broad an audience as possible,'' saidZhang Xiaojun, a 25-year-old math student who sat at a picnic tablewith a map of the city in front of him, signing up students.   Beijing University students also have organized ``propagandateams,'' said activist Ma Xieli.   When the student movement began April 15 with the death of aleading reformer, former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, only afew student leaders were able to articulate the reasons for theirdissatisfaction with the government.   But the shared experiences of the past six weeks, includingdramatic confrontations with police and exhiliarating marchesjoined by hundreds of thousands of local residents, havepoliticized the student population. Many say they won't return tothe relatively drab routine of a Chinese college student, whichallows little opportunity for individual initiative.   ``When we leave the square that doesn't mean we will havefinished the struggle,'' Ma said, even if the students succeed inforcing a change of government. ``Our chief goal isn't for this orthat person to resign but to speed up the progress of democracy.''   ``Regardless of what faction takes power, it will seek todestroy our movement,'' said Chen. ``The party and government haveto think of their own interests.   ``Democracy and freedom and science cannot be accomplished inone or two years,'' he said. ``We can only struggle stage by stage.I am willing to keep working, and I hope the next generation ofstudents will too.''</TEXT></DOC>
