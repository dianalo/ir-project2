Prosecutors blocked access by the former officials to evidencethat could be used against them in the widening corruptioninvestigation.   State television showed pictures of people joining police atluxurious government guest houses and at warehouses in East Berlinand Potsdam to block any efforts to remove documents.   Officials appealed for calm as people tried to force their wayinto secret police offices in Erfurt.   In Leipzig, where about 200,000 people attended a rally callingfor German unification, 30 demonstrators were allowed inside thesecret police headquarters, including opposition leader WolfgangSchnur.   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the group was letin ``after massive demands of demonstrators who had surrounded thebuilding.'' It said the protesters presented their grievances anddeparted but 200 other demonstrators who refused to leave werepermitted inside later to tour the building.   Parts of the building were sealed off to prevent documents frombeing smuggled out and Schnur said citizens would take part inmaking sure the papers remained there.   Wolfgang Schwanitz, new chief of national security, orderedflights to Romania halted because of reports that sensitivematerial was being smuggled to the Warsaw Pact ally, whose leader,Nicolae Ceausescu, has rejected reform.   Officials said there was no proof documents were being sentthere. Opposition sources said earlier that important documentswere taken from party headquarters to Schoenfeld airport forflights to Romania.   Premier Hans Modrow, who emerged as the leading political figureone day after the entire Communist Party leadership resigned, wasnot in East Germany. He led a three-member delegation to the WarsawPact summit in Moscow   At the huge Leipzig rally, the crowd applauded and cheered asspeakers called for a united Germany. Demonstrators waved dozens ofWest German flags in front of the secret police headquarters. Oneflag was draped over a surveillance camera mounted outside theheadquarters.   It was the third week that calls for German reunificationdominated the Monday night Leipzig protests, and the demands weremore pronounced than ever.   ADN reported 60,000 people rallied in Karl-Marx-Stadt, 10,000 inSchwerin and tens of thousands in Dresden.   President Bush indicated at a special session of NATO leaders inBrussels that a single Germany loyal to NATO would satisfy both theGerman yearning for unity and a nation's right toself-determination, but added later to reporters:   ``We are not trying to accelerate the process. It's better tolet things move on their own.''   The Christian Democrats, one of four parties allied with theCommunists, said they were cutting those ties, East Germantelevision reported. It said they demanded that Egon Krenz, whoresigned as Communist Party chief Sunday along with the Politburo,also give up the largely ceremonial post of president.   Brigitte Zimmermann, spokeswoman for the party's interimgoverning committee, a reform-minded group of 25 people, appealedfor calm to avoid ``anarchy and chaos.''   ``The committee members have been troubled to learn ofindications of people taking the law into their own hands andtrying to forcefully enter public buildings,'' she said in astatement read to reporters in East Berlin.   Flights have been prohibited, as part of the anti-corruptioncrackdown, in the area of a huge depot stocked with weapons theousted leaders were selling in the Middle East, Africa and LatinAmerica.   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a ranking former official who ranthe weapons operation, has fled the country. The government saidlate Monday it was enlisting its embassies in an internationalsearch for him.   Officials in West Berlin said Schalck-Golodkowski might be there.   In the first official cooperation between the government andopposition, a joint commission was formed to investigate corruptionunder Erich Honecker, who led the Communist Party for 18 yearsuntil Krenz replaced him in October.   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer promised the jointcommission would root out all cases of ``corruption and misuse ofoffice.'''   Two former members of the Politburo have been imprisoned as aresult of anti-corruption investigations and 12 former leaders havebeen expelled from the party.   Opposition members urged citizens during a news conferenceMonday to ``block coverup attempts and illegal removals'' ofdocuments and other items. Lothar Scharsich, spokesman for theopposition group New Forum, also pleaded for ``no violence.''   In Bonn, the chief aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of WestGermany said the East German party was ``incapable of acting'' andhad ``totally lost the trust of its supporters, its members and thepeople.''   Rudolf Seiters has been negotiating with with East Germanleaders on financial aid, in exchange for which West Germanydemands free elections and economic reform, and laying thegroundwork for a visit by Kohl to East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
