Lenders were asking, on average, a 10.44% rate on 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages during the week ended Aug. 5, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Though the rate was down from 10.49% the week before, it was up from 10.38% a month before, and higher than the 1987 average of 10.21%.    Initial rates for conventional adjustable loans with rates tied to one-year Treasury notes averaged 7.9% during the week ended Aug. 5. That was up from 7.87% the previous week, 7.79% one month earlier, and the 1987 average of 7.83%. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Analysts said they expect rates to continue moving up, fueled by a strong economy. Moreover, on Tuesday the Federal Reserve raised to 6.5% the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, and on Thursday major banks boosted their prime rate to 10%. The prime is a benchmark for setting interest rates, including home loans.    &quot;Whenever the economy is running along nicely, it puts some pressure on interest rates,&quot; said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. &quot;More businesses and people are making money, but they're also doing more borrowing.&quot;    Mr. Obrinsky said he expects fixed-rate mortgages to edge upward to about 11% by the end of the year. &quot;Of course, we'd like to see rates come down,&quot; he said, &quot;but (11%) wouldn't be too bad.&quot;    In another survey, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the average effective rate for fixed-rate mortgages dropped in early July to 10.73% from 10.78% in early June. Economists believe the drop, which also was picked up by the Freddie Mac survey during the period, was an aberration in the general upward trend.    The Bank Board survey said the initial rate on adjustable-rate mortgages rose in early July to 8.86% from 8.8%. </TEXT></DOC>
