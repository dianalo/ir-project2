The talks held under the auspices of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, GATT, officially opened Wednesday morning butwere adjourned after one hour to allow more time for informaldiscussions to reach a compromise on agriculture, intellectualproperty, textiles and GATT escape clauses.   It is recognized that agreement on agriculture is fundamental toconsensus being reached in Geneva on the other three outstandingissues.   ``We will have a final agreement on all four or none,'' saidKarl Falkenberg, a spokesman for the European Economic Communitydelegation.   In his opening speech at the morning plenary session GATTDirector-General Arthur Dunkel said that agreement on anagricultural package was near.   But eight hours of informal talks ended in disagreement betweenthe EEC, the United States and the so-called Cairns free-tradegroup over short-term measures to freeze agricultural productionand subsidies.   Differences between the EEC and the United States on farm policycaused stalemate at GATT's ministerial talks in Montreal inDecember.   ``The problem appears to be the same as it was in Montreal,''said Rubens Ricupero, head of the Brazilian delegation.   Dunkel, who heads the 96-nation trade forum, was expected tospend Wednesday night drafting a new set of compromise proposals topresent to GATT's plenary session Thursday morning, officials said.   Negotiators refused to speculate on the consequences of failureto reach agreement at the negotiations, scheduled to end Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
