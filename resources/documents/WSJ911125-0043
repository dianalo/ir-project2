The case, which had been pending for more than a year,raised troubling ethical questions about the use byprosecutors of confidential information obtained fromaccountants about their clients -- and whether similartactics could be used against legal clients. The prosecutionso outraged accountants in Missouri that the state'slicensing board yanked the informant's accountingcertificate.</LP><TEXT>   Justice Department officials in Washington offered noexplanation for the decision Friday. In St. Louis, U.S.Attorney Stephen B. Higgins said only, justice &quot;dictated thatwe seek a dismissal.&quot;   The case, which was the subject of a front page story inThe Wall Street Journal in February 1990, involved St. Louisaccountant James W. Checksfield and his client, restaurateurSteve Noles. Mr. Checksfield, himself in trouble with theIRS, was approached by agents in 1979 and asked to work as a&quot;controlled informant.&quot; In exchange, the IRS paid Mr.Checksfield $1,000. The IRS also dropped a criminalinvestigation of him. Mr. Checksfield declined to comment onthe Justice Department's decision Friday.   Over five years, while earning fees from Mr. Noles, Mr.Checksfield served up enough incriminating evidence to indicthis client on charges of skimming unpaid tax receipts fromhis restaurant. By dealing with Mr. Checksfield during thecriminal investigation of Mr. Noles, the IRS was essentiallydealing with itself, said Mr. Noles's St. Louis attorney,David V. Capes, in a statement.   Both the federal magistrate and the federal judge assignedto the case in St. Louis expressed strong reservations aboutit. In one pretrial hearing, U.S. Magistrate William S. Bahnnoted that if the case typified IRS practices, &quot;furtherinternal security and reform would seem to be mandated.&quot;   Mr. Capes, of the law firm Rosenblum, Goldenhersh,Silverstein andamp; Zafft, praised the Justice Department andfederal prosecutors in St. Louis for showing &quot;a true sense ofjustice and fair play&quot; by declining to prosecute.   But criminal-defense experts saw a different motive.&quot;I'msure they did it because they knew the judge was going toslam them,&quot; said Keith Stroup, executive director of theNational Association of Criminal Defense lawyers, inWashington, D.C.   Mr. Stroup and other criminal defense experts noted asteady series of similar intrusions into the confidentialityof lawyerclient relationships by federal prosecutors duringthe Reagan and Bush administrations, but nothing on the scaleof the IRS's pursuit of Mr. Noles through his accountant.   Lawyers' relations with their clients are shielded by theattorney-client privilege, a constitutional protection thatstems from the Sixth Amendment right to legal counsel. Nosimilar legal safeguard applies to accountants, said ConoNamarato, a tax litigator in Washington.   ---   JUDGE CLEARS DISCRIMINATION case against American Expressunit for trial.   The age-discrimination class action case against AmericanExpress Co.'s IDS Financial Services Inc. was filed in 1989by 32 former division managers who allege they were replacedwith younger, less experienced employees. The EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission in 1990 intervened in thecase on behalf of the plaintiffs.   U.S. District Judge David S. Doty in Minneapolis ruledlast week on 21 motions and allowed the case to go forward onclaims made under the federal Age Discrimination inEmployment Act. The judge denied IDS's motions to decertifythe class, conduct separate trials of the plaintiffs'allegations and remove the EEOC from the case. The judge hadpreviously said he would put the case on a priority trialschedule.   &quot;Plaintiffs present significant evidence that IDS had apolicy and practice of age discrimination involving astrategy to either terminate or force older division managersto retire, thereby calling into question the allegedvoluntariness of any plaintiff's retirement or resignation,&quot;Judge Doty said in his decision.   The judge ruled in favor of Minneapolis-based IDS onseveral issues, throwing out emotional distress, punitivedamages, most retaliation claims and other allegations madeby the plaintiffs.   Stephen J. Snyder, a partner at the St. Paul law firmWinthrop andamp; Weinstine, which represents the plaintiffs, saidthe allegedly discriminatory terminations of managers beganin 1985, a year after American Express acquired IDS. &quot;Thiswas not a reduction of force,&quot; he said. The plaintiffs rangedin age from 43 to 69 years old when they left IDS and mosthad more than 20 years experience with the company, Mr.Snyder said.   An IDS spokesman said in a statement that the company'sexposure in the suit had been reduced. &quot;The case has gottenbetter. . . . When this case goes to trial,&quot; he said, &quot;IDSremains confident that a jury will conclude there has been nodiscriminatory conduct. IDS does not discriminate. One thirdof the plaintiffs retired or resigned. One third wereterminated for performance reasons and one third engaged inmisconduct or inappropriate behavior.&quot;   ---   BIOGRAPHER CAN USE limited portions of unpublished work,appeals court rules.   The widow of author Richard Wright had sued hisbiographer, who had used parts of Mr. Wright's letters andjournal entries. Ellen Wright claimed that biographerMargaret Walker violated copyright laws by quoting thematerial in &quot;Richard Wright Daemonic Genuis.&quot;   The federal appeals court in New York ruled that Dr.Walker had not violated copyright laws because she had usedthe material &quot;sparingly.&quot; The decision is noteworthy becausein a prior case, involving a biography of J.D. Salinger, thecourt had ruled against the use of any unpublished works.   In its decision last week, the appeals court said that itsruling in the highly publicized Salinger case did notconstitute a &quot;per se rule&quot; barring the use of privatematerial. Dr. Walker's use of unpublished material raised &quot;anobstacle&quot; to ruling in her favor &quot;but not an insurmountableone,&quot; the appellate panel said.   Robert M. Callagy, attorney for Time Warner Inc.'s WarnerBooks Inc. unit, the book's publisher, said the decision&quot;retreated&quot; somewhat from previous decisions strictlycontrolling access to unpublished works. &quot;It doesn't end thediscussion&quot; if the work is unpublished, Mr. Callagy said,adding that court now seems willing to look at how muchmaterial was used and in what way.   But Floyd Abrams, who filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot; briefon behalf of the Authors Guild Inc., said he was disappointedthat the court didn't go further. &quot;The only reason Warner wonis that the book quoted such a tiny amount,&quot; Mr. Abrams said.   Mrs. Wright's attorney could not be reached.   ---   SUIT ALLEGING THAT LAX security contributed to assault issettled.   In the agreement, convenience store franchiser White HenPantry Inc. paid $600,000 to a clerk in a franchisee's storewho was raped and beaten by two robbers. The clerk,24-year-old Aurelia Garcia, had sued the chain alleging thatlimitations on franchisees' security devices had contributedto the assault on her in a Fall River, Mass., store in 1988.   Closely held White Hen, Elmhurst, Ill., said &quot;the companywasn't in any way responsible,&quot; but it said its insurerdecided to settle. The plaintiff's attorneys had subpoenaedthe two convicted assailants, but White Hen settled beforetheir testimony was heard.   ---   NOTED: A federal jury in White Plains, N.Y., found thatEquitable Capital Management Corp, an investment arm ofEquitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., didn'tdiscriminate against Joan Conan because of her age, gender ordisabilities. Mrs. Conan, who once worked in Drexel BurnhamLambert Group Inc.'s junk bond department, was dismissed in1987 from her job as manager of Equitable's high-yield bondportfolio. Mrs. Conan's attorney couldn't be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
