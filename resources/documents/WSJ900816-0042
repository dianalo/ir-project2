The maker of high-end workstations signed across-licensing agreement covering IBM's entire patentportfolio plus all patents filed before July 1, 1995.</LP><TEXT>   While Sun and IBM never went to court over their patents,the move marks the end of negotiations that began two yearsago, when IBM wrote Sun a letter suggesting that it &quot;needed alicense to some of their patents,&quot; said Michael Morris, vicepresident and general counsel of Sun, based in Mountain View,Calif.   IBM's vast portfolio of technology encompasses 10,000 U.S.utility patents, and it grows at a rate of 600 applications ayear. &quot;With a portfolio of such breadth and depth, you runthe risk of inadvertent infringement,&quot; Mr. Morrisacknowledged. Sun's portfolio, he added, numbers just 25,with 106 applications pending.   IBM has been insistent about requiring that smallercompanies take licenses to its technology. In 1989, IBMstruck a similar cross-licensing pact with Compaq ComputerCorp., requiring the Houston-based maker of PC clones to payan estimated $100 million over five years.   While its terms with Sun weren't disclosed, some analystsbelieve Sun paid considerably less. &quot;It's very different,&quot;said Thomas T. Rooney, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. &quot;Compaq shipped a lotof product perceived to be infringing,&quot; whereas Sun doesn'tengage in the same head-to-head competition. Sun said it willpay a net royalty payment of a fixed dollar amount to IBM infive annual installments.   &quot;Normally, such agreements amount to 1% to 3% of relatedrevenues,&quot; Mr. Rooney said. &quot;It's not going to be significantto Sun.&quot; Sun said in its statement that it doesn't expectmaterially adverse impact on its financial performance. Innational over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun stockdeclined early in the day and closed at $28.25, down 75cents. IBM stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $105 a share inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading.   While the companies didn't specify which products ortechnologies were at the heart of the deal, some analystsbelieve it has to do with IBM's original RISC -- or reducedinstruction set computing -- technology dating from the1970s. RISC has since been widely adopted throughout thecomputer industry.   Other possible points of contention, according to Mr.Rooney, are IBM's semiconductor-fabrication technology andits microchannel-based products, which relate to its PC busarchitecture, which is a sort of data highway into which allinformation from chips and other parts flows.   &quot;It may be that Sun is looking to bring RISC technology tothe desktop in the form of microchannel-compatible products,&quot;Mr. Rooney speculated. &quot;That would help Sun further penetratethe low end of the market.&quot; Most of Sun's products sell for$20,000, but it has recently introduced products in the$5,000-to-$10,000 range.   An IBM spokesman called the deal &quot;a typical arrangement,&quot;asserting such cross-licensing pacts &quot;help keep one's assetsin a certain amount of control.&quot; The Armonk, N.Y., computergiant now has an unspecified amount of cash to help defrayits massive research and development budget.   Some also speculate that IBM, in gaining access to Sun'spatents, might find a use for Sun's proprietary file-servertechnology.   But on balance, Mr. Rooney of Donaldson Lufkin says, &quot;It'sa face-saving device to call this cross-licensing. What doesIBM need from Sun?&quot; Probably not much, apart from itspossible interest in Sun's file-server technology, he added.&quot;It's a mistake to blow this out of proportion.&quot;   The agreement is expected to remove a potential liabilityfrom Sun's books. Since IBM served notice with its 1988letter, Sun's annual report has routinely disclosed thematter as a &quot;contingency,&quot; while downplaying its potentialimpact on Sun's books.   Mr. Morris, Sun's general counsel, said the licensingagreement won't change Sun's primary business focus. &quot;Ourphilosophy from the start has always been to pursue an opensystems architecture that can communicate with products ofIBM and others.&quot; he said.   With one important difference, he adds. &quot;This agreementgives us access to patented technology that we canincorporate into our products.&quot; He didn't elaborate onpotential applications.   Mr. Morris refused to respond to any speculation aboutpossible applications of IBM technology. &quot;We didn't focus onany specific technology in our part of the negotiations,&quot; hesaid.   &quot;We don't have any current plan to incorporate IBMtechnology into our products,&quot; he added, whether it be RISCor microchannel products. &quot;Legally, we can. But whether ornot we do is subject to further evaluation.&quot;   Sun's fiscal 1990 profit rebounded strongly from adepressed 1989 performance to $11.2 million, or $1.21 ashare. Revenue grew 40% to $2.47 billion. During the yearended June 30, Sun logged both record bookings and shipments,and increased its world-wide installed base of workstationsand file servers to 285,000 units.   ---   Laurence Hooper contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
