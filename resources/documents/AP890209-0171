Eligible for the lottery are citizens of the Soviet Union, Polandand several other countries whose refugee quotas are filled. Theapplication period is March 1 through March 31. Unlike the last suchlottery in 1986, the visas will not be issued on a first-come,first-serve basis.   Instead, the applications will be fed to computers and theselections made on a random basis. Immigrants from all the eligiblecountries will have an equal chance.   Unlike refugees, who are generally given haven for politicalreasons, immigrants are required to have close relatives in theUnited States or have a scarce profession. However, the 20,000 to beadmitted under the special program will not have to meet thoserequirements.   Only screening for mental or criminal liabilities will beconducted, U.S. officials said.   The only countries excluded are those that used more than 5,000immigrant slots in fiscal 1988. These are China, Colombia, DominicanRepublic, El Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, South Korea,Mexico, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.   The excluded include Taiwan and also natives of Anguilla,Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands,Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Monteserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, Turks andCaicos Islands.   A lottery for 10,000 visas was held in 1986. About 1.4 millionapplicants lost out.   The State Department announcement contained strict rules forapplicants. Among them is that all applications must be typewrittenand that husbands and wives may apply separately.   Last month, in a move to admit more Soviet and East Europeanrefugees, former President Reagan decided to increase this fiscalyear's quota by 7,000 by lowering the quota of Vietnamese refugees,many of whom are former political prisoners.   The decision brought to 25,000 the number of Soviets who will bepermitted to enter the United States. While the added slots will betaken mostly from the quota for refugees from Vietnam, U.S.officials stressed the president has considerable flexibility toalter the totals later on.   Thousands of Soviet refugees, many of them Jews, are in Viennaand Rome, waiting for permission to come to the United States, andthe quota for them to enter this country is full.   The lottery announced Thursday will give them a chance to enterthe country as immigrants _ but the chance will be no greater thanthat of applicants from the 161 other countries that are eligible.</TEXT></DOC>
