Yesterday, the South Africans, led by acting President F.W. de Klerk, returned. This time, though, they rode through town in an official motorcade and were cheered by residents lining the streets. They spoke of peace. They pleaded for understanding. And they shared their vision of regional cooperation and economic development.    The stark contrast of the two visits, separated by a little more than two years, illustrates the shifting nature of Pretoria's relations with its southern African neighbors, moving away from destabilization and toward negotiation. And it underlines the belief of the South African government that the best way for the country to break its international isolation is through efforts in Africa, particularly southern Africa.    &quot;The overwhelming majority of South Africans recognize the necessity of South Africa breaking through in southern Africa,&quot; Mr. de Klerk said after nearly three hours of talks with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda. &quot;South Africa as a regional power has a role to play and it is more and more being recognized for that.&quot;    During their talks, the two leaders discussed ways to revive the faltering peace process in Angola, which is torn by a 14-year-old civil war, and they reviewed Mr. de Klerk's plans to reform South Africa's racial segregation known as apartheid and his promises to open negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution bringing the black majority into national politics. Mr. de Klerk said that a position paper on negotiations drafted by the African National Congress, which is banned in South Africa and based in Zambia, wasn't discussed. And Mr. Kaunda apparently didn't offer to serve as a mediator between the ANC and Pretoria, after hinting last week that he would.    But for the South Africans, the significance of the meeting goes beyond what was and wasn't discussed; more important is that it took place at all. Mr. Kaunda is one of Africa's most venerated leaders, and as an outspoken opponent of apartheid he has led the push for economic sanctions against South Africa's white government. Mr. de Klerk knows that if he and his country are to gain the respect of the rest of Africa, they will need Mr. Kaunda's nod.    &quot;We're more excited about what it {the meeting} can do for the country's place in the world than about the immediate impacts in the region,&quot; said a senior South African banker. Said another businessman: &quot;We hope it's the beginning of our way back from isolation.&quot;    Although the Zambian leader described the meeting as &quot;useful,&quot; he wouldn't give his impressions of Mr. de Klerk. But the South African delegation was in high spirits after the talks. &quot;We are grateful that it went so well,&quot; said a South African involved in the discussions. &quot;The two leaders got on very well. There was mutual understanding . . . a feeling of friendship.&quot; He quoted Mr. Kaunda as saying that Mr. de Klerk, who is expected to win a full five-year term as president after South Africa's Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, &quot;brings new hope to southern Africa.&quot;    For years, South Africa pursued a path of destabilization in southern Africa by supporting rebel guerrilla groups in Angola and Mozambique and occasionally launching raids aimed at destroying ANC operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana. According to the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, a regional economic group that excludes South Africa, these acts cost Pretoria's neighbors more than $10 billion in economic development from 1982 to 1987.    But now South Africa talks of the sovereignty of the various southern African nations, and Mr. de Klerk promotes a doctrine of noninterference in one another's affairs. Last year, Pretoria pulled its troops out of Angola and agreed to start the independence process currently under way in Namibia. It has revived negotiations with the Mozambique government. And since the Livingstone raid, external forays against the ANC are rare.    Still, southern Africa remains wary of Pretoria's intentions, and overcoming this mistrust is the biggest regional challenge facing Mr. de Klerk. His big carrot is the economic strength of South Africa, which, economists and business leaders throughout the region agree, should be the motor of regional development. But before he can dangle the prospect of greater economic cooperation in front of his impoverished neighbors, he will have to resolve the racial conflict at home.    &quot;Zambia would like to see us coming into Africa,&quot; said Sidney Matus, the president of the South African Chamber of Commerce, who recently led a delegation that discussed business prospects with Mr. Kaunda. &quot;But the only reason it doesn't happen is because of apartheid. We were told in very definite terms that there will be no real movement in the region while apartheid laws are still on the books.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
