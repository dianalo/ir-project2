One suggested method for reducing irregularitiesis to install a screen at the inlet to the gas collection shaft; a diagramshows how to select the optimum design characteristics for the louvres,taking into account the ambiguity of the hydraulic resistance in theshaft. Based on the findings of the modeling, it is now possible to constructa louvre system for intaking current into the shaft which ensures thatthe deviation from the mean of the flow parameters of the pulverizerinlet is not more than 5-10%. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
