House conferees are insisting on the provision, which would raise $2.4 billion over three years, while Senate Republicans are demanding an alternative method that would cost the contractors much less. With Senate Democrats reluctant to get too far in front of their GOP colleagues, the tax bill, for the time being at least, appears to be stopped in its tracks.    &quot;That's pretty much where it is at this point,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), who is leading the Senate conferees.    The House-passed tax bill would repeal the completed-contract method of accounting, under which defense companies and other long-term contractors can defer a portion of their taxes until the contract is completed.    The Senate bill doesn't contain this provision, but the Senate Republicans yesterday suggested an alternative called the revenue-realization method. Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, the top GOP tax negotiator in the Senate, said Republican senators and the Reagan administration could accept a new proposal requiring long-term contractors to pay taxes as the right to income arose under their contracts.    Conferees have zeroed in on military contractors to come up with more than $1 billion in additional federal revenue. Basically, the conferees agree on how to raise about $3 billion over three years. Both House and Senate bills would accelerate corporate estimated-tax payments, restrict the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations, and curb life-insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters.    But to get a conference agreement, the House and Senate have to settle on the size of the tax bill. The House-passed bill would raise about $7.5 billion in taxes over three years; the Senate version would raise about $2.5 billion over the same period. House conferees last week offered to agree to a $4.5 billion tax rise, but so far their Senate counterparts have refused.    Senate Republicans' new proposal for contractors would raise more than $900 million over three years. This would bring the bill to about $4 billion, if the House were to accept it.    Lawmakers said there won't be any breakthroughs until Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee returns to Washington, which is expected to be today. Sen. Packwood said he spoke with Mr. Rostenkowski yesterday by phone, but they didn't resolve any differences. And they didn't schedule a meeting between the House and Senate conferees.    House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) told reporters yesterday that the tax bill isn't dead yet. He added that without some breakthrough in the next couple of days, it probably won't become law before Congress adjourns in a few days. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) said, &quot;There's been some progress, but there's still some work to be done.&quot;    Both House and Senate bills, while raising different amounts of taxes, would use that revenue to extend several expiring tax breaks such as the research-and-development tax credit. They also would make technical corrections to the 1986 tax-overhaul law.    Because there are so many provisions in these bills sought by diverse groups ranging from farmers to multinational corporations, there was some speculation yesterday that the stall on the bill could be part of a negotiating strategy and in the end produce a bill that could be sent to the president. </TEXT></DOC>
