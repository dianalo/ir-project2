The distribution and variation of radioactivesubstances around Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station and in USSR due tothe accident are shown. The worldwide contamination centering aroundEurope is also shown. In Japan, the rise of radioactivity level due tothe accident was small. The radioactive substances which seemed to beoriginated from the accident were detected from May 3, 1986, and as thenuclides, I-131, Cs-137, Cs-134, Sr-90, Ru-106, Ru-103, Te-132, Ba-140,La-140, Ce-144 and so on were found. Sr-90 somewhat rose in May, butin June, it returned to the state in April, and the level of Cs-137 wassomewhat high until July, but returned to the state in April around September.The concentration of radioactive nuclides in foods in Japan was low.The concentration in milk became the maximum in the middle of May, thoughthe maximum fallout occurred on May 3 - 5. As the natural radioactivenuclides in Japan, 110,000 pCi of K-40 and 70,000 kCi of C-14 are containedin a whole body. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
