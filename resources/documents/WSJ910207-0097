The Malmo assembly plant is an industrial white elephantthat opened less than 18 months ago. Swedish businessmagazine Affaersvaerlden said that Saab directors will decideformally at a meeting tomorrow to shut the plant, idlingroughly 900 workers amid a deepening recession.</LP><TEXT>   Saab officials admit that closure of the Malmo facility isone option among a range of acute cost-cutting measures beingconsidered. Already staggering under huge losses, Saab ismoving quickly to reduce production for 1991 after sales inJanuary plunged.   A decision to scuttle the Malmo plant could causerelations between management and unions to deteriorate.   After General Motors Corp. bought a 50% stake inSaab-Scania AB's ailing Saab car division in late 1989, ahandful of GM executives were recruited to head the new jointventure. Many analysts had cautioned that the introduction ofU.S.-style management might spark labor strife.   Instead, David Herman, Saab's chief executive officer,managed to win major concessions from the company's unionleaders. Analysts warn, however, that unions would have atough time accepting closure of an entire plant -- especiallythe Malmo facility, which was part of a ballyhooed attempt bySwedish auto makers to ditch the assembly-line process.   Saab lost 2.1 billion kronor ($383.9 million) before taxesin last year's first eight months, equaling its loss for allof 1989. A person familiar with the company's operations saidits loss widened in the last four months of 1990.   Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar PLC unit said it plansto stop production for two weeks out of three until the endof March to cope with declining sales.   An official at the luxury car maker said that the movescover three manufacturing plants in the U.K., which havecombined weekly production of 800 units. About 800 hourlyproduction workers will be laid off at the plants as a resultof the decision, he added.   U.K. sales of Jaguar cars were down 47% in January at 806units, compared with 1,530 a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
