The move marks a further consolidation of the spiritsindustry and represents another U.S. distillery bought up bya foreign concern. Guinness's United Distillers (USA) willnow be the third largest spirits company in the U.S., up fromsixth. It will rank behind Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain,whose U.S.-owned businesses include Heublein, andMontreal-based Seagram Co.</LP><TEXT>   The acquisition also represents a huge windfall for theLouisville, Ky., distiller's chairman, James Thompson, whorepresents the fourth generation of his family to serve as aGlenmore executive. Mr. Thompson will receive $11.6 millionfor his shares in the company. He will step down asGlenmore's chief executive officer, a post he has held since1974, but will remain as chairman and will become chairman ofUnited Distillers (USA).   Under the agreement, Guinness will pay $42.50 each forGlenmore's Class A and Class B shares -- a 134% premium forthe nonvoting Class B stock, which was trading at $18.125before the acquisition was announced. After the announcement,the stock closed yesterday at $41.375, up $23.25 in AmericanStock Exchange trading. Class A shares, controlledprincipally by the family that founded the company, aren'ttraded. Guinness also will assume $58 million in Glenmoredebt.   The acquisition has already been approved by 90% ofholders entitled to vote and needs no futher shareholderapproval. The acquisition helps round out United Distillers'premium product line, which includes Johnnie Walker BlackLabel and Dewars, with several fast-growing, moderatelypriced vodka and scotch brands that Glenmore produces. Themost attractive is Scoresby, one of the nation'sfastest-growing Scotch whiskys. Glenmore's other big brandsare Skol vodka, Fleischmann's Royal vodka and Fleischmann'sgin, as well as several bourbons and cordials.   &quot;The U.S. is still the biggest spirits market, and {buyingU.S. companies} is one way for foreign companies to controltheir own destiny,&quot; said Frank Walters, research director forM. Shanken Communications, which publishes an industrynewsletter in New York.   With annual sales of $373.7 million, Glenmore was theeighth-largest U.S. spirits company. While analysts saydistillers this size are struggling to compete, Glenmore'smove suprised some company observers, who say in the clubbyworld of Kentucky bourbon makers, the Thompson family longtook pride in keeping Glenmore independent while competitorslike Maker's Mark Distillery sold out. In a 1989 promotionalbrouchure, Glenmore pointedly noted that it was not followingthe industry trend of international mergers but was stickingto its &quot;roots in the soil of Kentucky.&quot;   In a statement yesterday, Mr. Thompson, 59 years old, saidthe Guinness acquisition represents Glenmore's &quot;next stage ofdevelopment&quot; and that the merged company will be &quot;a majorforce within the industry.&quot;   Mr. Thompson owned 8.84% of Class B shares and 67.71% ofClass A stock, as of Aug. 31, 1990, according to thecompany's proxy statement. The acquisition comes one yearafter Mr. Thompson saw his stake in Glenmore increase by93,409 Class B shares. According to the proxy, Mr. Thompsonwas the beneficial owner of the shares held in the estate ofhis father, Col. Frank B. Thompson, who died last year.   James Thompson couldn't be reached for comment. Glenmore'snew chief executive will be Joseph E. Heid, chief operatingofficer of United Distillers North America.</TEXT></DOC>
