By day, Navy commandos called Seals use patrol boats to check out dhows and fishing boats that either venture too close or might be sowing mines.    At night, Army helicopters skim over the water in near silence, observing shipping activity with night-vision gear that reveals even the smallest craft in ghostly, green detail.    &quot;As far as we're concerned, nothing's changed,&quot; said the commander of the barge Winbrown 7, a Navy officer who identified himself only as Gary. &quot;Until we hear otherwise, we'll just continue to operate as we have been.&quot;    Winbrown 7 is one of two commercial barges the Navy hired 10 months ago as &quot;mobile sea bases&quot; to support Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of 11 Kuwaiti tankers given U.S. registration and American flags, after Kuwait and Saudi Arabia rejected U.S. requests for land bases.    Both barges fly Panamanian flags and are anchored in international waters outside Saudi Arabia's 12-mile limit. They are within 40 miles of Farsi Island, a base used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards for speedboat attacks on commercial ships trading with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.    Attacks around Farsi tapered off in late 1987. None were reported this year until the weeks before Iran's July 18 announcement that it would accept a year-old U.N. Security Council proposal for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq. No attacks in the gulf by either side have been reported since the Iranian declaration.    U.S. officers say neither Winbrown 7 nor Hercules, the other barge farther north, has ever been threatened.    A Winbrown 7 officer under orders to give only his first name, Alex, said the Iranians presumably know the barges exist, since &quot;we're in their backyard, and we don't think they're foolish or stupid.&quot;    A ring of floating anti-missile reflectors around the barges are said to generate radar images several times their actual size to fool incoming missiles. Except for those and the guns, the barges resemble the oil platforms and derricks that dot the gulf.    Officials in Washington acknowledged their existence last year, but Navy officers based in the gulf have refused to discuss the barge operation, its cost or the fact that Kuwait pays the bill.    The approximately 200 soldiers, sailors and Marines on each barge get no shore leave during duty tours of 90 to 120 days, and cannot tell their families where they are or what they are doing. Living conditions are cramped and spartan, and temperatures usually top 100 degrees.    Two chow lines, &quot;one spicy and one regular,&quot; meet the needs of both the military and about 50 Indian and Filipino civilian workers living aboard, he said. U.S. officials say the workers are given security screenings.    Alex described his assignment as &quot;out here on the pointy end of the stick&quot; where &quot;it's hot, it's lonely, and it's hot.&quot; He said recreation sometimes includes swimming in &quot;the world's biggest warm water pool.&quot;    Last week, when Pentagon officials lifted secrecy enough to permit journalists to visit Winbrown 7 for the first time, the rules specified no last names and no pictures of men in sensitive roles.    The reception was coolly polite, but some officers could not conceal their displeasure that the Pentagon was exposing a secret operation to journalists. A lieutenant colonel who commands the Army helicopters prefaced his briefing with: &quot;First, I want to know why we're doing this.&quot;    He said publicity might endanger his pilots' lives. Because they operate only at night, he would not let his men make a daytime flight for television cameras.    The helicopters, highly classified versions of OH-58 scout aircraft, recently replaced smaller MH-6 Seabats on the barges. One pilot said the choppers are so stealthy that fishermen and others in small craft rarely if ever spot them.&quot;I've watched them pulling in their nets but I've never seen them look up,&quot; he said &quot;As far as I can tell they never know we're here.&quot;    Journalists were taken on a run in the Seals' 65-foot Mark III patrol boat. A sign in the cockpit said: &quot;This operation is so secret that even I don't know what I'm doing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
