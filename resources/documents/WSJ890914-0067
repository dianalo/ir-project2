In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Kimco said it would solicit consents to call a special meeting for the purpose of removing the trustees. A spokesman for HRE said the company would provide the list to Kimco.    Kimco, which with affiliates holds 8.9% of HRE, indicated it wants to elect new trustees who are &quot;committed to realizing the underlying value of the trust's properties.&quot; Kimco, Roslyn, N.Y., develops shopping centers; HRE, New York, owns office buildings and shopping centers.    In May, HRE rejected Kimco's $27-a-share, or $148.1 million, acquisition proposal. Since then, advisers from Kimco and HRE have met and discussed Kimco's interest in the trust, but no plans or proposals have been made, the filing said.    The trust's shares rose 37.5 cents to $23.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
