Thegovernment immediately appealed.   The public has a right to know about matters of such interestand importance, U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann said in ruling onrequests by the Los Angeles Times, the Copley Newspapers chain andNBC.   ``We are talking about the foundations of our country, thedefense of our country,'' Reichmann said.   The documents in question are affidavits filed in support ofsearch warrants. In the court papers, investigators set out thewrong they believe has been done and what they seek in theirsearches.   The warrants were used June 13 to search the offices of NorthropCorp., Teledyne Industries, Litton Industries and the home ofdefense consultant Fred Lackner. They were among 33 search warrantsexecuted across the country that day.   At the request of U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner, Reichmann delayedthe unsealing until 2 p.m. The government then said it wasappealing the ruling to U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, whoscheduled a hearing for 2 p.m.   Bonner had argued that disclosure of the affidavits would alerttargets of the investigation and might encourage them to destroydocuments. He also contended that the First Amendment right ofaccess applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted.   The investigation, which became public last month, centers onallegations that defense industry consultants bribed Pentagonofficials for inside information useful in winning winmultimillion-dollar contracts.   If Reichmann's order stands, Los Angeles would be the thirdcity, after St. Louis and Dallas, in which sealed documentsdetailing aspects of the probe were made public.   In Alexandria, Va., today, a U.S. District judge rejected asimilar unsealing request by attorneys for consultant MelvynPaisley, a former assistant Navy secretary who is a key figure inthe probe. Paisley's home and office were searched.   Reichmann adopted the position argued by attorney Rex Heincke,representing the Times, who said the outpouring of publicity on thedefense fraud probe in the last month makes the sealing unwarranted.   ``It's important that these people that want to know, this smallband of people that read the papers, can feel they have some say tocheck up on what people in all three parcels of our government aredoing,'' Reichmann said.   The magistrate said citizens are entitled to ask, ``are we justthrowing our money away when we buy these defense programs?''   ``Corruption, bribery, these are things that go to the heart ofhow our government functions,'' he said.   Reichmann disclosed that one of the affidavits has beenmisplaced by the court clerk's office ``for no sinister reason''and may not be available.   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, had also urged at thehearing today that the affidavits be unsealed to allow him toproperly defend his client, who he said has been ``effectively putout of business'' by the seizure of all his business records.</TEXT></DOC>
