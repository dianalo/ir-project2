Pursuant to these requirements, theEPA reviewed the criteria and air quality standards for particulate matterand promulgated substantial revisions to the then-existing standards onJuly 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634). The July 1, 1987, particulate matter rulesreplaced the former standards for total suspended particulate matter (TSP)with a new indicator that includes only those particles that are (10) micrometersor smaller in diameter (PM<T4>10</T4>). The new 24-hour primary (health-based) standards limits PM<T4>10</T4> to 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air (as compared to 260micrograms per cubic meter for TSP). In addition to the 24-hour standard,a new PM<T4>10</T4> annual standard is set at 50 micrograms per cubic meter (ascompared to 75 micrograms per cubic meter for TSP). The promulgation ofthe PM<T4>10</T4> rules resulted in several other regulatory revisions whichare the subject of this notice.The States have primary responsibility for implementing the National AmbientAir Quality Standards (NAAQS). Under section 110 of the Act, each Statemust develop and submit to the EPA a plan that provides for attainmentand maintenance of each NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable within certaintime limits. Furthermore, each State is required to adopt and submit aSIP to the EPA within nine months after the promulgation or revision ofa primary NAAQS.For effective implementation of the PM<T4>10</T4> program within the constraints of the available resources,the EPA established a priority ranking which allowed focusing the effortsto those areas that showed significantly high potential for not meetingthe PM<T4>10</T4> standards. Using the then-existing TSP data, the EPA developedan analytical procedure that classified all of the counties of the nationinto three groups based on their probability of not attaining the new PM<T4>10</T4> standards. The primary characteristics of each group was identifiedas: Group I included areas with a high probability of not attaining thestandards, Group II contained areas where the existing air quality datawere not sufficient to determine if they were attaining the standards,and Group III carried areas where there was a high probability of attainingthe standards without additional controls. The public notice of this procedureand its results were published in the August 7, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 29383). Under this scheme, the entireState of Arkansas is classified as Group III area.<ITAG tagnum="84">State Submission</ITAG>On June 3, 1988, the Governor of Arkansas submitted several revisions tothe Arkansas Air Pollution Control regulations, adopted by the Commissionon Pollution Control and Ecology on March 25, 1988, as a SIP revision alongwith the State's other supporting documents for approval. These revisionswere in response to the promulgation of the PM<T4>10</T4> standards and related regulations by the EPA on July 1, 1987.The State's submittal contained (1) adoption of all NAAQS as in effecton July 31, 1987, including the PM<T4>10</T4> standards, (2) adoption of the EPA definitions for particulatematter, (3) revisions to the PSD SIP regulations and readoption of theFederal PSD regulations as in effect on July 31, 1987, and (4) changingcertain references to particulate matter in the SIP permit review regulationsto refer to all pollutants for which the NAAQS exists [subsection f(ix)of ``Section 4. Permits''].The Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (ADPCE) adoptedthe NAAQS and the Federal PSD regulations through incorporation by reference.The initial Arkansas PSD SIP was approved by the EPA on January 4, 1982(47 FR 2112). By choosing the reference adoption date as July 31, 1987,the ADPCE adopted not only the revisions to 40 CFR 52.21 promulgated onJuly 1, 1987, but also the revisions promulgated between June 25, 1982and July 31, 1987, including promulgation of the new source review visibilityrequirements, the revisions to the EPA's <T3>Guideline on Air Quality Models, </T3>and the November 7, 1986, restructuringof 40 CFR Part 51. The NAAQS and particulate matter definitions are addedto the existing State regulations under ``Section 3. Definitions'', assubsection (z) through (ff), and other sections of the SIP approved regulationsare modified to reflect the PM<T4>10</T4> provisions. These revisions are identical and consistent withthe EPA requirements.All areas in the State of Arkansas are currently designated as attainmentfor the TSP standards (also for all other pollutants) and it is reasonableto assume that the State's existing regulations will continue to maintainand protect the PM<T4>10</T4> standards in the State. For this reason, ADPCE, Division ofAir Pollution Control, has no generic nonattainment area regulations. However,the ADPCE has begun to monitor for PM<T4>10</T4> and has submitted a PM<T4>10</T4> monitoring network plan which has been approved by the EPA.Should the monitored PM<T4>10</T4> data show any exceedances leading to a violation of the standards,by the methods specified in 40 CFR Part 50, Appendix K, the State willhave to submit nonattainment regulatory controls, control strategies, andimplementation plan for attaining and maintaining the PM<T4>10</T4> standard in the State.The promulgation of the PM<T4>10</T4> standards impacted 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart H_Prevention ofAir Pollution Emergency Episodes. The Arkansas SIP does not have any regulationrequring air pollution emergency episode plans for any area. The appropriatePM<T2>10</T2> provisions will be met when the ADPCE submits a complete regulatoryrevisions to include an air pollution emergency episode plan in its SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>The EPA has reviewed the State's submittal and determined that the Stateregulations and procedures adequately meet the requirements of the PM<T2>10</T2> standards and related Federal regulations promulgated by theEPA on July 1, 1987. Therefore, the EPA is approving all of the revisionssubmitted by the Governor of Arkansas on June 3, 1988, as a revision tothe Arkansas SIP.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective 60 days from the date of publication unless,within 30 days of its publication, notice is received that adverse or criticalcomments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action willbe withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent notices.One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a newrulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a commentperiod. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that thisaction will be effective on June 30, 1989.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by June 30, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements (See section 307(b)(2)).Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities(See 46 FR 8709).Incorporation by reference of the Arkansas State Implementation Plan wasapproved by the Director of the Federal Register on July 1, 1982. Thisrulemaking is issued under the authority of sections 110, 160-169, and301 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410, 7423, and 7601.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Sulfur oxides, Nitrogen dioxide, Lead, Incorporationby reference, Particulate matter, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
