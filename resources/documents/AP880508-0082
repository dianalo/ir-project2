The Socialist president pledged to fight the anguish, difficultyand uncertainty facing many French people.   ``You have chosen to accord me your confidence,'' saidMitterrand, 71.   ``There is too much anguish, too much difficulty and too muchuncertainty for too many in our society for us to forget that ourfirst duty is national solidarity,'' he said. ``Because the life ofhumanity depends on it, I will act passionately in your name forthe development of poor nations, for disarmament and peace.''   Chirac conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed.Mitterrand supporters drove along the main Champs-Elysees Avenuecheering and honking horns.   ``In a democracy, the public is the master and I bow before itschoice,'' the premier said. ``I wish good luck to France and goodluck to the French.''   Vote counting was suspended early Monday with 98.1 percent ofthe ballots tabulated. Mitterrand had 53.91 percent and Chirac46.09 percent. The turnout was 84.5 percent, less than the 85.9percent in the 1981 presidential election. More than 38 millionpeople were eligle to vote.   Chirac was expected to submit the resignation of his governmentin the coming days. His center-right coalition continues to controlthe National Assembly, but Mitterrand has said the new premier hewill name will try to work with the present Parliament. Failingthat, he will be forced to dissolve the Assembly and call newelections.   The state-run Antenne 2 TV network projected Mitterrand wouldreceive 53.9 percent of the vote _ the most since Georges Pompidouwon 58.2 percent in the 1969 runoff.   In the first round of elections on April 24, Mitterrand won 34.1percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates. Chirac wassecond with 19.9 percent.   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Frontwho won an astonishing 14.4 percent of the vote in the first round,said in a bitter statement that the traditional right was ``thestupidest right in the world.''   He blamed Chirac for scorning the National Front and said thatwas responsible for Mitterrand's victory.   ``Today, France is back in the dead end it could have escaped,''he said.   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a centrist whosupported Chirac, said Mitterrand's re-election was a defeat forthe government's center-right policies.   ``The president is going to name a new government,'' Giscardsaid. ``We will judge it by its acts. One should not decide inadvance to vote against it. I will vote for the laws that I findgood and I will vote against the laws that I find bad.''   The campaign ended on a dramatic note, with the Chiracgovernment winning the release of French hostages in Lebanon andNew Caledonia.   Election day was not without its problems. In central Paris, agroup of masked men wielding steel bars charged into a right-wingrally celebrating Joan of Arc day. Seven people were injured, fiveseriously. No group claimed responsibility.   In the tiny Alpine village of St. Eusebe-en-Champsaur, the localPTA called for a boycott of the election to protest the plannedclosure of the village school next fall. The school has only 12pupils, but the PTA says there have been a large number of birthsin the past three years that will increase future classes.   Two weeks ago, only 16 of the village's 135 registered voterscast their ballots in the first round.   The election marked the first time in the 30-year history of theFifth Republic that an incumbent chief executive and his premierfaced one another for the presidency.   Political debate throughout the long campaign focused largely ongeneralities with few concrete proposals made by either candidate.   During the last week of the campaign, three French hostages werereleased in Lebanon and French gendarmes freed a group of hostagestaken by separatists in New Caledonia.   Although Chirac said Saturday the incidents were not timed tocoincide with the election, the events became an important elementin the last hours of the campaign.   Mitterrand has said he ``contributed'' to the release of thehostages. ``There is no distinction between the government and mein such a sensitive matter,'' he said.   Mitterrand, who has moved markedly toward the center of thepolitical spectrum since he came to power in a Socialist landslideseven years ago, issued a long ``Letter to all the French.''   As opposed to 1981, when he campaigned on 110 specificproposals, his 1988 platform was vague, built around a ``rallying''of the French people for a ``united France'' and social justice.   Most of his ideas are aimed at getting France ready for 1992,when the European Economic Community drops all remaining tradebarriers and creates a true Common Market.   Among his few specific proposals, Mitterrand said he will stopthe cycle of nationalization and privatization of French companies,re-establish the wealth tax abolished by the right when it came topower in the National Assembly in 1986 and create a minumumguaranteed income. His top priority will emphasize training andresearch as the key to fighting France's 10.4 percent unemployment.   Chirac's platform, titled ``The Decade of Renewal,'' had threebasic themes: family, business and training. He pledged to continuethe policies begun in 1986 when the conservatives and centristsousted the Socialists from the National Assembly.   The premier's platform, which also focuses on modernizing theFrench economy before 1992, is short on figures, but calls forcontinuing to reduce taxes on business and individuals, athree-year budget deficit reduction program, furtherdenationalizations and an end to new immigration.   Mitterrand's current term ends at midnight May 20.</TEXT></DOC>
