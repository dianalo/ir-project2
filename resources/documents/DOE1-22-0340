Comparison of findings with a detailed surgicalreport reveals that in the case of central lumbar canal stenosis, CATscan provides a higher degree of reliability (72%) in diagnosis thandoes radiculography (56%). With lateral stenosis of the lateral cleft,reliability of both tests is identical (62%). The diagnostic deficienciesof these two examinations are discussed as well as diagnostic criteriaemployed and possible avenues of research. Currently, in the case ofstenosis of the lumbar canal, it is still necessary to perform both ofthese examinations in combination and to accept the fact that, in certaincases, only one of the two tests reveals the stenosis, to be able toattain a preoperative rate of correct diagnosis greater than 80%.</TEXT></DOC>
