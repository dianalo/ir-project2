On Wednesday night, a powerful bomb exploded in a car as itpulled into a suburban gas station, killing the man and womaninside. Police said they believed the two were terrorists workingfor drug bosses.   The planes were part of 375 aircraft confiscated since Aug. 19when President Virgilio Barco ordered government security forces tohunt down suspected traffickers and seize their property.   The National Drug Council decided that 180 of the aircraft hadbeen used in drug trafficking and turnd the planes over to theColombian air force, the daily El Tiempo said. It said 100 werereturned, and the council is investigating the other 95 aircraft.   Two bystanders also were injured in the blast Wednesday, whichleveled the station in the northwestern suburb of Suba, damaged atleast 12 cars and blew out windows of homes within 1,600 feet.   Police said the bomb contained 110 pounds of dynamite.   Early today, another bomb exploded at a bank in Bogota, injuringthe night guard and damaging at least 15 neighboring shops, policesaid.   The two blasts brought to 43 the number of bomb explosions inBogota since drug traffickers declared war on the government lastmonth. The traffickers want Barco to negotiate peace and reversethe government's decision to extradite cocaine barons to the UnitedStates.   Since the government began there have been almost daily bombingsand arson attacks in Bogota, the capital, and the drug traffickingcenter of Medellin. Ten people have been killed and 140 injured in114 attacks that have caused an estimated $5 million in damage.   Late Wednesday, Barco arrived in Washington for talks withPresident Bush about how to combat the drug bosses, who throughpayoffs and intimidation of judges and police have until recentlyoperated with near impunity in Colombia.   Earlier, he announced that his government had reached a peaceaccord with a leading leftist rebel group. He reiterated, however,that there would be no peace for the country's cocaine cartels.   Barco is to address the United Nations on Friday and is expectedto ask more countries to aid the country's drug battle. Barco hassaid Colombia cannot win the war without major help.   President Bush has approved $65 million in military equipmentfor the effort and, on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary John Major onBritain told the U.N. General Assembly in New York that his countrywould give ``substantial'' anti-terrorist aid, training,communications and other help to Colombia.   In a nationwide television and radio speech late Tuesday, Barcosaid democracy was at stake in the fight against the drug cartels.   ``This criminal organization wants to destroy the most preciousthing Colombians have _ their democracy,'' he said.   The peace treaty with the M-19 guerrilla movement is a majorachievement for Barco. Congressional approval is, however, neededfor major aspects of the accord, which was signed at a guerrillabase camp in the Andes mountains.   The treaty calls for M-19's estimated 2,000 rebels to turn intheir weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form apolitical party. It also calls for a national referendum on 53proposals, including land reform and programs to provide morehousing for the poor.   Congress would have to approve a change in the constitution toallow a referendum and any pardons. Barco said he will put theproposed treaty before lawmakers next week.   The peace treaty would end almost eight years of negotiations.   Colombia's politicians and lawmakers are divided over whetherthe government should pursue peace with the drug traffickers. Barcohas refused to consider negotiating with drug lords.   ``The drug terrorists do not respect the sacred right to life.They have threatened the press and they have trampled laws,'' hesaid.   Since the crackdown began, authorities have seized 1,056properties believed owned by the drug lords, including mansions,ranches and businesses, as well as 525 vehicles, 74 boats and 375airplanes, Barco said.   He said 10,800 people have been arrested and 535 charged withcrimes linking them to drug traffickers.</TEXT></DOC>
