Industry officials said the proposed tax incentives, worth atleast $350 million a year, would, if enacted, result in a measurablegain in oil and gas production.   ``This is a very healthy step forward,'' said Jim Groninger,Washington director of governmental affairs for the IndependentPetroleum Association of America. ``Tax incentives are an importantcomponent of a national energy policy.''   The tax breaks unveiled by Bush in his budget address Thursday toCongress were coupled with a postponement of lease sales for oildrilling off the California and Florida coasts _ areas the oilcompanies consider prime drilling prospects.   Bush said he was seeking to balance environmental needs with adesire to revitalize the depressed oil and gas industry, which hecalled vital to U.S. national security.   The American Petroleum Institute, representing the nation's majoroil companies, welcomed the Bush tax incentives but said more stepswould be needed, including opening up more federal lands andoffshore areas to oil exploration.   ``The tax incentives ... are a step in the right direction, butthey alone cannot stem the serious decline in domestic petroleumproduction,'' said Charles J. DiBona, president of the petroleuminstitute.   U.S. oil production has fallen by more than 1 million barrels aday over the past three years, and last December the oil productionrate was the lowest in nearly a quarter of a century. At the sametime, oil demand has increased in recent years, leading to areliance on imports that Bush says poses security risks.   Bush rejected the idea of imposing a tariff on imported oil butproposed four tax incentives aimed at boosting exploratory drilling,particularly by smaller operators. The tax breaks would be phasedout if the price of oil, currently about $17 a barrel, rose above$21.   The tax package includes:   _A 10 percent credit on the first $10 million of spending, percompany per year, on intangible drilling costs, those not directlyassociated with drilling a well, such as hauling equipment.   _A 10 percent credit for spending on all new tertiary enhancedrecovery projects, those that use steam, carbon dioxide or chemicalinjectants to increase the production rate from oil and natural gasfields.   _Allow drillers to exclude a major part of their income from thealternative minimum tax.   _Change oil and natural gas depletion rules that theadministration says discourage the transfer of marginal wells frommajor oil companies to independent producers and result in thepremature abandonment of producing wells.   The administration said the tax package was aimed mainly at thesmaller producers, which traditionally have drilled the majority ofnew wells in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
