But the consulting firm hadtrouble explaining, much less marketing, its new service,known less-than-snappily as &quot;Strategy Driven Systems.&quot;   The solution: An artist designed six hanging sculpturesrepresenting key aspects of the system. Little curvedenameled pipes, for example, depict its flexibility. Abrochure featuring these mobiles will go to new clients.Cooking up a flashy brochure took some doing, says RaymondLane, a senior vice president at Booz-Allen, Hamilton Inc.&quot;It has to say something to senior management.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mobiles aren't exactly Madison Avenue. But Booz-Allen'sartistic efforts illustrate the struggles that facemanagement consulting companies as they try to beef up theirimages.   The most competitive consulting market in years -- somesay ever -- is pushing once-reticent consulting firms intounfamiliar marketing territory.   Companies that once ducked the limelight now hirepublicists, solicit testimonials from clients, sponsorconferences and cozy up to journalists. Some bury academicjournals under a blizzard of papers. At least one firm haseven turned to television advertising.   But rocks dot the road to fame. Some companies find ithard to explain what they do. (Typically, managementconsultants for a fee help companies handle business problemslike plotting strategy, solving personnel problems orredesigning manufacturing or marketing systems.) Severalclaim the strongest resistance to their own marketing comesfrom within their own firm. Others say old-time methods stillsuit them just fine.   &quot;We don't make cold calls. We don't send fliers. We don'tsend letters,&quot; asserts Frederick Gluck, managing director ofconsultants McKinsey andamp; Co. He adds,&quot;We don't need to do it.We have all the work we can handle.&quot;   Still, many firms think change is inevitable. &quot;Managementconsulting is becoming more a business and less aprofession,&quot; says Marvin Schiller, managing director, NorthAmerica, at A.T. Kearney Inc.   One reason: the deteriorating economy, which is trimmingthe consulting industry's double-digit growth rate of thepast five years. While many consulting firms still saythey're growing faster than ever, a number acknowledge theirgrowth rates have slowed substantially.   Of 17 firms recently surveyed by Consultants News, a tradepublication, four reported decreases in first-half revenuesof between 10% and 25%; four had increases of less than 10%;two showed unspecified growth; two wouldn't say; and onlyfive showed increases of more than 10%. &quot;That's a big changefrom what we have been used to hearing,&quot; says Managing EditorDavid Lord.   Also, some tough players are intensifying their battle fora slice of today's market. The genteel Ivy League world ofstrategy consulting increasingly is being attacked bytechnological whizzes like Andersen Consulting, an offshootof accountants Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. Because of their rootsin the competitive accounting profession, companies likeAndersen have lots of experience in shootouts with rivals.   &quot;In the old days it was white-gloves competition,&quot; saysCarl Sloane, chairman of consultants Temple, Barker andamp;Sloane/Strategic Planning Associates Inc. &quot;You wouldn't evenhire someone from another firm without asking permission.&quot;   Like doctors and lawyers, consultants have until veryrecently viewed publicity as unseemly. While 60% of firmssampled for a report released earlier this year by Britain'sAlpha Publications Ltd. depended on old-boy networks, only 3%used advertising and 3% public relations consultants topromote themselves. Consultants protected their clients'confidences the way a psychiatrist might. &quot;For the first 60or 65 years {at Booz-Allen} you didn't talk to anyone,&quot; saysMr. Lane. &quot;You were the CEO's consultant, and the CEO didn'twant anyone to know he had a consultant.&quot;   Today, buyers of consulting services are shopping around.What's more, says Thomas Doorley III, managing partner ofBraxton Associates, &quot;We may be consulting with a client whois using a competitor. Ten years ago, that never happened.&quot;   So testimonials from satisfied clients become moreimportant. In the past, Bain andamp; Co.'s policy was not to evensuggest a client's identity in public. Nowadays, it sometimesseeks a client's approval to do so. Last year for the firsttime, a brochure for Booz-Allen's information systems groupincluded names of clients.   Here's how four well-known consulting companies areadapting to the leaner, meaner years:   -- In common with many other firms, Boston ConsultingGroup Inc. must draw 20% of its work each year from newbusiness, and it's being &quot;very aggressive,&quot; says JohnClarkeson, president and chief executive officer. Noting thatrivals are being unusually flexible in the terms they'reoffering clients -- for example taking on smaller projectsthan in the past -- Mr. Clarkeson suggests that hisassociates &quot;really {make} sure clients check our references&quot;and consider bringing in Boston Consulting's senior officialsand knowledgable executives based at faraway branches to helpclinch the deal.   -- Bain: Companies that once sold their services onreputation alone now find themselves struggling to definespecific products or areas of expertise. Bain has reorganizedinto &quot;practice areas&quot; where it can offer expertise, such ashealth care, services and information technology, banking,marketing and manufacturing. Peter Dawkins, managing directorof North American operations, says Bain had been losing&quot;competitive bake-offs&quot; because rivals marketed theirexpertise in specific industries, while Bain didn't.   -- At Braxton Associates these days, individualconsultants spend close to half of the time that they aren'tactually consulting on product-development work, comparedwith about 25% two or three years ago. &quot;New competitors popup all the time,&quot; says managing partner Thomas Doorley III.&quot;It forces us to be on our toes.&quot;   -- A.T. Kearney, a firm that has traditionally focused onlogistics consulting, is now forming groups to developproducts in different specialties like information technologyand marketing. One new product is called &quot;Stages ofDevelopment.&quot; Says Mr. Schiller: It's a visual presentation&quot;of where a company stands in its business capability andwhere it should be. In the past, it would be more a matter ofstarting from a zero base and providing a tailored program tothe client.&quot;   Developing products doesn't work, of course, if nobodyknows you have them. Firms that once dodged publicity nowcourt it. Earlier this year, Bain hired its first full-timepublic-relations official, and Andersen Consulting last yearnamed its first time national public relations director.Today, that official supervises a dozen people and twooutside public-relations firms. &quot;Frenzy isn't too strong aword&quot; to describe the quest for advice, says a publicrelations aide for one consulting firm.   Noting their growing numbers, a group of New York-basedand Boston-based P.R. types working for consulting companieslast year formed a group they call the Breakfast Club.Members meet every two months and talk about seminars, bookpublishing, ads.   One strategy sparks lots of debate among consultants:using television ads. Andersen Consulting, which specializesin information technology and consulting in computer systems,uses TV as part of an &quot;image campaign&quot; that began last year.This year, the firm is budgeting $10 million for ads.   Andersen's ads -- including shots of a computer mousebeing manipulated by a real one -- hit an industryunaccustomed to such directness like a bomb. Booz-Allen'sposition probably represents that of most competitors: &quot;Weare thinking about it, but we aren't doing it,&quot; says Mr. Laneat Booz-Allen. Why not? &quot;We're snobs,&quot; he says. &quot;We like tostay above the fray.&quot;   Even at Andersen, says A. George Battle, the company'smanaging partner in charge of market devlopment, &quot;It's aninteresting cultural shift to work in an area many peoplethink of as slightly sleazy.&quot; In the first year, 60 peoplehad to approve the ads. &quot;It felt like the gestation of anelephant.&quot;   Many expect, however, that if the economy tightensfurther, competition will only intensify. &quot;When I got intothe business, all you needed to consult was a blue sergesuit, an air-travel card and a Harvard MBA,&quot; mourns Mr.Sloane at Temple, Barker andamp; Sloane.   ---            Consultants Resort to Promotions                                                                                                          Percentage of management consultants in North Americausing these promotional techniques                                                                                                          Personal relationships/     &quot;old boy&quot; network                      60%   Participation in seminars                33   Mailing and phoning                      13   Door-to-door selling                      7   Advertising                               3   Marketing agents                          3   Public relations companies                3                                                                                                          Source: European Federation of Management ConsultingOrganizations</TEXT></DOC>
