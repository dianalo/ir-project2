PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents of a disputed region in the republic ofAzerbaijan shut down their main city for a second day today toprotest the government's refusal to transfer the region toneighboring Armenia, a newspaper said.   ``My report today will be short,'' P. Gutiontov, a correspondentfor the government newspaper Izvestia wrote from Stepanakert.``City enterprises are at standstill, people are home.''   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also told aregular news briefing that some workers in Stepanakert stayed homefrom their jobs.   ``Certain enterprises are not functioning or are partially notfunctioning,'' he said.   Stepanakert is the biggest city in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region inAzerbaijan which Armenians want annexed to Armenia. Activists saida general strike began last Wednesday in the mostly Armenian area.   In a separate report, the afternoon newspaper Izvestia providedthe first breakdown of casualties in Sumgait, an Azerbaijani citywhere ethnic rioting broke out Feb. 28. It confirmed the officialdeath toll of 32, and said 26 of them were Armenians while six wereAzeris.   Activists have claimed the death toll was much higher.   Gerasimov said residents of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, wentto work as usual. He reiterated that the government would not beforced into appeasing Armenian demands to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.   ``We cannot solve the problem by mechanically transferring thisregion as some Armenian officials want,'' he said. ``The more youstudy this problem the more you will see the whole thing is not assimple as that, as merely saying Nagorno-Karabakh must be part ofArmenia.''   Also today, a Moscow dissident said police on Monday eveningbroke up a demonstration by more than 50 people who demandedfreedom for a jailed Armenian activist and carried signs saying,``We don't believe in perestroika.''   The dissident, Tamara Grigoryants, said she received herinformation about the protest in a telephone conversation withmembers of a committee promoting Armenian self-determination inYerevan.   Police did not interfere with an earlier demonstration Monday inYerevan by more than 100 people, but dispersed the second group,she said.   She said her telephone call was interrupted and she could notfind out other details, including whether there were any arrests.   Both groups demanded freedom for jailed nationalist leaderParyur Arikyan, she said.   Arikyan was arrested in Yerevan after being detained by policein Moscow, where he had provided information to foreign journalistsabout events in Armenia. Dissident sources say they have learned hehas been charged under a law prohibiting spreading falseinformation about the Soviet Union.   The signs against perestroika were a challenge to Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev and his broad effort to restructure Sovietsociety. The Soviet government last week declared Armenianagitation for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh intolerable butreleased a plan to improve economic and social conditions in theregion.   Gorbachev has appealed for patience and said that thepolicy-making Communist Party Central Committee will discuss thedispute in an upcoming meeting on relations between the SovietUnion's more than 100 nationalities.   Officials have pledged a cultural and economic development planfor Nagorno-Karabakh, apparently instead of meeting the Armeniandemand to annex the territorty.   The newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura said today the plan would costup to $640 million.   ``These millions, which are so necessary now for restructuring,the country is giving to Karabakh,'' it said in a front-pagearticle tracing the unrest to poor social and economic conditions.   Sovietskaya Kultura backed the Soviet leadership's plan toimprove conditions, even though Armenian activists have saidspecifically that improvement of education, cultural facilities andeconomic conditions will not solve the problem.   The newspaper said there is almost a complete absence ofschoolbooks in the Armenian language, no teaching of Armenianhistory and that residents of Nagorno-Karabakh could not receiveArmenian television.   It said each resident of the area would have a separateapartment or home by the year 2,000 and that the government wouldbuild two reservoirs to improve the water supply to Stepanakert.</TEXT></DOC>
