The new pay plan, which was described by people familiarwith the firm, follows a similar guarantee for Salomon'sstock-research group last month.</LP><TEXT>   In the wake of Salomon Brothers' Treasury-auction biddingscandal, the securities firm's new management has movedquickly to slash costs. The Salomon Inc. unit has dismissedscores of highly paid, high-ranking employees and cut theclout and bonuses of its stock and investment-banking groupsas it returns to its historical strength in bond trading.   But the moves appear to have had serious consequences,leading to defections by senior stock analysts, investmentbankers and others. The unusual pay directives for bothinvestment bankers and stock analysts -- approved after aseries of meetings with Salomon's chief operating officer,Deryck Maughan -- are aimed at easing the turmoil inSalomon's ranks.   A Salomon spokesman declined to comment yesterday onspecific pay plans. But he said the pay guarantees are partof a &quot;firmwide&quot; plan to set a floor on 1992 compensation; hesaid talks of such guarantees started last May, before thefirm's scandal surfaced. &quot;The notion is to give people someidea of some minimum expectations, done by departments,&quot; thespokesman said.   Like investment bankers at other Wall Street firms,Salomon's bankers get the bulk of their pay from a bonus poolwhose size is determined by the firm at the end of each year.It is highly unusual for a Wall Street investment bank toguarantee payouts for entire groups of employees beforeprofits are determined.   Under the new Salomon pay plan, the firm's investmentbanking department will be divided into five sectors: realestate, Europe, Asia, U.S. corporate finance and financialinstitutions. Each will have its own pay pool.   If a sector exceeds its revenue targets, all bankers willget more money, with managing directors -- who hold a seniorpost -- reaping the most benefit. If the targets aren'tmatched, most bankers will still receive a 15% pay raise --but managing directors will suffer deep pay cuts.   &quot;The key thing is if the firm does well, managingdirectors in particular can make a lot of money,&quot; said asenior Salomon executive. &quot;If the revenue isn't there, therisk is substantially on those people.&quot;   Salomon's pay directive could be a gamble, some analystssay. They caution that guaranteeing pay can be a recipe fortrouble on Wall Street, which is noted for its volatileearnings. And now with pay guarantees set for Salomon'sstock-research and investment banking departments, otherSalomon departments are vying for similar deals, peoplefamiliar with the firm said.   Salomon officials assert that the new plan doesn'tconflict with the highly publicized &quot;pay-for-performance&quot;stance of Salomon's interim chairman, Warren Buffett. That'sbecause the pay of individual investment bankers still willbe based on performance within the guaranteed pay pool.   Some Salomon investment bankers already are grousing aboutthe new pay plan. With their 1991 bonuses already down anaverage of 25% from a year earlier, these bankers say their1992 compensation still could fall short of what they werepaid in 1990, despite the planned raise. In 1990, 106 Salomonemployees made $1 million or more each, including manyinvestment bankers.   &quot;A 15% raise is pretty good only if you're paidcompetitively to start with,&quot; one Salomon investment bankersaid.   But senior Salomon executives stress that the revenuetargets are modest, and will be exceeded if the stock andbond underwriting market stays hot. &quot;We think these areachievable goals,&quot; said a senior Salomon executive. At thevery least, he asserted, &quot;There's no question about thefirm's commitment to {investment} banking.&quot;   The plan comes as Salomon's investment banking groupmounts a comeback in Wall Street's underwriting race. InJanuary, Salomon climbed to No. 3 in the rankings forunderwriting new stocks and bonds, with an 11.4% marketshare, after slipping to No. 7 for all of 1991, with a 7.5%market share, according to IDD Information Services Inc. en</TEXT></DOC>
