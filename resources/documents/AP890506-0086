In the decade ahead this pattern is apt tochange,'' he said.   The government on Friday reported the slowest month-to-monthgrowth in the service sector in nearly three years, although itstill expanded while manufacturing posted declines.   According to Thurow, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management,the downward trend in manufacturing has to end for a number ofreasons, primarily the need of the United States to erase its tradedeficit, running at an annual rate of $115 billion so far this year.   ``Eventually, the dollar will fall to whatever level isnecessary for the United States to balance its internationalaccounts,'' Thurow concluded in the study. ``At that point theUnited States will either export more manufactured goods or replaceimported manufactured goods with domestically made alternatives.''   Foreign debt has cost the United States more than 4 millionmanufacturing jobs, Thurow projected, saying the formula forsolving the trade defict was restoring those manufacturing jobs inaddition to any added by general economic growth.   As a practical matter, Thurow said those jobs also will benecessary to prevent higher unemployment because of his projectedhalt in service-sector growth.   Thurow cited a number of factors to support the projection.Among them:   _Intensive efforts to rein in health care costs, which in turnwould cut demand for workers.   _A natural end to restaurant growth because most meals now areeaten away from home, as well as a decline for sales personnelbecause of a natural limit to longer shopping hours. Those twofactors in turn would result in lower demand for real estate andbuilding maintenance.   _A peak in demand for white collar workers, which in turn wouldadversely affect office construction.   _Sinking demand in financial services because of growingpressure on American financial institutions as the marketplacebecomes increasingly global and foreign institutions offer cheaperloans and other products.   Taking those factors into account, Thurow concluded that theUnited States has little choice if it wants to erase its tradedeficit and avoid high unemployment.   ``These jobs have to come in manufacturing since they can comein nothing else,'' he wrote.   At the same time, he called for a re-examination of the low-wagestructure of the U.S. service economy.   In a background paper included in the Thurow study, LouiseWaldstein, an associate at Klein and Co. Inc, a managementconsulting group, said wages in portions of the service-sector thattraditionally offer low pay need to be raised in return forproductivity gains.   ``Millions of people are in the growing industries of retailtrade or building services and earn less than the wages necessaryto support a satisfactory standing of living,'' Waldstein wrote.``Such a large proportion of American workers are in these low paidjobs that we may be creating an entire group of working Americansunable to support themselves adequately on on full-time earnings.Clearly, increasing low-wage employment contributes to a decline inthe standard of living.''   Thurow pointed to the poor productivity of Americanservice-sector workers compared to those of West Germany and Japan.   While there has been some increased demand for services,particularly health care because of the aging population, Thurowattributed the majority of job growth in most of the sector tofalling or sluggish productivity growth.   In contrast, producivity among service-sector workers in WestGermany and Japan has increased dramatically, with the foremostfactor the higher wages paid for service jobs in those countries,Thurow said.   Factors behind the higher wages include higher minimum wages,enforcement of those wage floors and greater unionization, he said.   Had American productivity growth mirrored that of Germany, hesaid, the United States would have added only 3.6 million of the15.5 million new service jobs generated between 1972 and 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
