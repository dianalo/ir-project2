Chun, looking tired and strained, told a news conference he wasresigning as chairman of the Advisory Council of State Elders andas honorary president of the governing Democratic Justice Party.   The former president said he was giving up the offices becausehe failed to prevent his brother's embezzling a fortune in cash,land and stocks through government contacts. He said his brothershould be judged sternly.   ``I cannot but keenly feel that it was due entirely to my ownincompetence and lack of discretion that I have failed to controland supervise my younger brother,'' Chun said.   Chun Doo-hwan's resignation leaves him without any officialpositions and appears to signal his departure from politics. Aspresident of the advisory council, he served as a principal adviserto the president.   Chun's brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, is awaiting trial on charges ofembezzlement, influence peddling and extortion while he was head ofthe semi-official Saemaul Undong, or New Community, developmentmovement.   The younger Chun was named to the post in 1981, while hisbrother was president, and resigned last year. The movementoversees rural and urban development projects.   Government prosecutors say they have evidence that millions ofdollars was stolen by the younger Chun and his associates to builda private empire that operated under official protection.   Some government officials are being investigated on suspicionthey covered up protection to protect the president's family. Theformer president has not been implicated in the corruption probe.   ``I cannot refrain from being sorry that my foolish youngerbrother has committed scandalous acts and caused uneasiness ofheart among the people,'' the former president told reporters.   Opposition parties demanded the elder Chun cooperate with theprobe into Saemaul and prove he was not involved in the scandal.   The opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, which has chargedthe former president was involved in corruption, demands he provehe was not involved in spiriting funds overseas.   The opposition hopes to make the Saemaul revelations a majorissue in the April 26 National Assembly elections to embarrass thegoverning Democratic Justice Party.   President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded Chun Feb. 25, is thought tohave sanctioned the corruption probe to discredit his predecessorand undermine Chun's attempts to retain power. The former presidentreportedly wanted to use his advisory position to wield influencebehind the scenes.   Roh, a former general, helped put fellow general Chun in powerwith military backing in 1980. But Roh promised during last year'spresidential campaign to investigate allegations of widespreadcorruption under the Chun administration.</TEXT></DOC>
