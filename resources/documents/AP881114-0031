(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Ray Mabus persuaded state lawmakers inAugust to adopt anti-corruption changes in county government, andnow voters in more than half of the state's 82 counties have takenthe reforms even further.   ``It was a vote on how much Mississippi is willing to change,''said Mabus, who led a group of young, reform-minded Democrats intooffice last November with county government reform as one of thehallmarks of his campaign.   Voters in 48 counties agreed last Tuesday that their county'ssystem for constructing and maintaining roads should be changed.They approved a ballot issue to streamline the corruption-plaguedroad operations.   The county government reorganization bill passed by lawmakers wasinspired by an FBI corruption investigation that snared dozens ofpublic officials.   Mabus, as state auditor, assisted the FBI in the crackdown oncorrupt county purchasing practices that resulted in charges rangingfrom mail fraud to extortion against 57 county supervisors in 25counties.   Prodded by Mabus, the state legislature in August approved a billrestructuring the state's century-old system of county government,but left the the road issue up to voters.   At the time, 22 of the state's counties had already abandoned the``beat system'' which gave the five supervisors in each countycontrol over policy and day-to-day operations in the district thatelected them.   Mabus claimed the ``beat system'' invited officials to steal.   Under the new system, the part-time supervisors set the policyand hire an administrator to oversee consolidated county operations.The state bill also requires counties to establish centralpurchasing, receiving and inventory control systems with separateclerks for each.   Many of the supervisors vocally opposed the changes. The410-member Mississippi Association of Supervisors had placedestimates for the switch at more than $36 million statewide forproperty purchases and personnel.   Mabus and the Mississippi Economic Council, the statewide chamberof commerce, however, had predicted a statewide savings of $27million by eliminating duplicated equipment and services.   While instigator of the changes, Mabus is reluctant to claim thevoter approval of the road changes as a personal victory.   ``I don't think it's a referendum on you unless your name is onthe ballot,'' Mabus said, while adding that he was ``very happy withthe outcome.''   Others disagree.   ``Overall, it was a victory for political reform in the state andsince the governor really took the lead, it was a victory for him,''said Steven Shaffer, a political science professor at MississippiState University.   House speaker Tim Ford said he viewed the outcome of thereferendum ``as a victory for the citizens of the state, regardlessof who proposed it.'' He added, however, ``Certainly for those infavor of the unit system, which included the governor, I think it isa victory.''   Every urban county in Mississippi, which is largely rural tobegin with, voted to adopt the unit system, but Mabus shuns anydivision of the vote along urban-rural lines. Some of the countiesthat voted in favor of the switch are ``as rural as you get,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
