At least three more years of research are needed before thevaccine can be tested on humans, but scientists say the findingcould help in the search for an AIDS vaccine, the Los Angeles Timesreported.   ``I think it is going to be a source of great excitement in theneurological and virological communities,'' said Steven J. Greenbergof the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.   The vaccine, developed at Ohio State University, protected agroup of macaque monkeys against a virus called HTLV-1, which causesa rare form of leukemia and has been linked to other diseases.   HTLV-1 is a member of an unusual family of viruses calledretroviruses, which include the AIDS virus.   Insights gained in the monkey research may show scientists whichcomponents of the AIDS virus must be present in a vaccine, said OhioState pathobiologist Richard G. Olsen.   The HTLV-1 virus, discovered in the early 1980s by virologistRobert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, causes adultT-cell leukemia and lymphoma, and has been linked to multiplesclerosis, systemic lupus, erythematosus and other rare neurologicalconditions.   The virus is spread by the exchange of bodily fluids, in the samemanner as the AIDS virus. Infection by the HTLV-1 virus is endemicamong intravenous drug users in some Eastern urban areas.   The Olsen group developed the virus by building on informationlearned in the successful search for a virus to protect house catsagainst infection by a retrovirus that causes feline leukemia, theNo. 1 killer of domestic cats.   Neither the cat nor monkey vaccines contain the virus itself, butparts of proteins secreted by animal cells that were infected withthe virus.   Olsen said that the protein finding was important in AIDSresearch because most potential AIDS vaccines being developed onlyuse one type of protein and thus probably will be less effective.   ``More than one protein is going to be necessary'' for an AIDSvaccine, he said.   Some of Olsen's vaccinated monkeys have gone as long as two yearswithout showing any traces of infection, but Greenberg and otherscientists note that the HTLV-1 virus can remain hidden for two tofour decades before triggering an infection.   Olsen, who reported his findings at a recent meeting onretroviruses, is studying the long-term impact of the vaccine byusing sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search fortraces of infection in vaccinated monkeys.</TEXT></DOC>
