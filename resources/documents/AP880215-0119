Many people had the day off for Presidents' Day, and the FrenchQuarter filled with hard-drinking crowds.   Much of the party today was aimed at the river front, where astand-in for Rex, king of Carnival, was to arrive aboard a CoastGuard cutter on the Mississippi River to celebrate Mardi Gras Eve,or Lundi Gras.   The real Rex won't show up in public until Fat Tuesday, when heparades through the streets.   On Sunday, police said even rain didn't seem to affect thenumber of people who turned out for the traditional parades on theSunday before Mardi Gras.   Television star Alan Thicke, who plays Jason Seaver on ``GrowingPains, reigned as this year's god of wine, Bacchus 1988. The Kreweof Bacchus, in a flashy super-parade that capped the night'sprocessions, celebrated ``20 Years of Bacchus'' by honoringprevious celebrity gods such as William Shatner, Bob Hope and DannyKaye.   Three men were arrested Sunday after one allegedly dumped a softdrink onto a police officer and then threw the bottle into thecrowd, where it hit a 3-year-old girl in the face, police said.   The child was reported in good condition today at a hospital.   Krewe of Bacchus member Robert Chaney was booked with battery ona police officer and resisting arrest, police said. In addition,two bystanders were booked with interfering with a police officer.   Earlier Sunday, the big street party known as Carnival delightedparade-goers but made life difficult for florists makingValentine's Day deliveries.   ``It hinders delivery and we can't make full service,'' saidRonnie Scheinuk, vice president of Scheinuk the Florist, a companystarted by his grandfather. ``We're right on a parade route.''   Scheinuk said he had to have a delivery crew of 10 start at 6:30a.m. to finish by 11:30, a half-hour before the first parade rolledin front of his store. But there were compensations to being on amajor parade route.   ``We've had tremendous walk-in business,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
