The 17 months since the African National Congress wasunbanned haven't been easy times. Despite some successes, theANC's leaders face restive members who favor more aggressivestands toward the government and want more say within theirown organization.</LP><TEXT>   Caught by surprise when it was made legal, the ANC has hadto cope with members coming from three different kinds ofexperiences -- exile, jail and activism within South Africa.&quot;Of course the ANC has had problems and still has them,&quot;Deputy ANC President Nelson Mandela told a June 16 rally.&quot;After 30 years of banning, so many forced into exile, whileour entire society has been subjected to brutal repressionand thousands detained and imprisoned -- it would have beensurprising if everything had gone without a hitch.&quot;   Many within the organization feel the leadership has givenup too much and gotten too little from the negotiationsbetween the ANC and the South African government. &quot;There'senormous frustration and feeling of betrayal&quot; that SouthAfrican President F.W. de Klerk has reneged on agreementswith the ANC, said Barbara Hogan, leader of the ANC regionaround Johannesburg. &quot;There's a sense that we've been takenfor a ride.&quot;   While most of that anger is directed at the government,many ANC members complain that the leadership hasn't takenthe decisive measures needed to aggressively push thegovernment at the negotiating table. &quot;We may not have alwaysgot the mix between discussions and mass action right,&quot; Mr.Mandela told a recent union meeting.   &quot;Since the unbanning there has been a certain tension, onewould say, between the ground and the leadership,&quot; saidStanley Nkosi, deputy political education director. Thattension has been voiced in the debate over the newconstitution that will be adopted at this convention. A monthago, regional representatives met with members of the ANC'sNational Executive Committee and changed the draftconstitution to give the regions and branches more power onthe committee.   The membership is demanding accountability, even from itsheroes. &quot;People demand their rights, wherever they are,&quot;explained Stone Sizani, a Port Elizabeth member. The abilityto choose leaders is crucial, he added. Incumbencies lasting20 years, as happened during the ANC's period in exile, areunpalatable, he said.   Mr. Mandela, who will be 73 years old this month, isconsidered certain to take over the presidency from theailing Oliver Tambo. But other longtime leaders such asmuch-criticized Secretary-General Alfred Nzo are likely toget the boot. Many members are pushing Cyril Ramaphosa,leader of the Nation Union of Mineworkers, to replace Mr.Nzo.   Delegates are likely to demand that the new constitutionrequire leaders to report more fully and frequently tomembers. Part of the gap between the membership and theleadership arises from differing perceptions on how much theANC has accomplished during the past 17 months.   Mr. Mandela can quickly list ANC victories achieved sincehis release on Feb. 2, 1990, after 27 years in prison. In aninterview, he said the ANC has forced the government to:   -- Abandon apartheid and accept non-racialism.   -- Talk to the ANC on the ANC's terms.   -- Broaden its definition of political prisoner to includethose whose crimes were motivated by opposition to apartheid.   -- Set a deadline for the release of political prisoners.   But he acknowledges that membership is lower than he wouldlike and that efforts to reach out to minority groups havebeen less successful than he hoped.   In the black townships, activists point to the politicalprisoners still in jail after the April 30 deadline for theirrelease, to the violence that seemed to spread just after theleadership suspended ANC armed action against the government,to the mistaken impression foreigners have that apartheid istotally dead, and to the crumbling of international sanctionsagainst South Africa.   Last August's suspension of the armed struggle remains themost unpopular leadership decision. Complaints are widespreadthat the decision was taken without consulting themembership. And the increase in township violence has leftmany residents feeling unprotected.   But in an example of the conflicting pressures on the ANC,anti-apartheid leader Allan Boesak, who says he's &quot;not yet&quot;an ANC member, warned in a radio interview that glorificationof the armed struggle by ANC leaders encourages &quot;the childrenout there to think it is still okay to become involved inviolence.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
