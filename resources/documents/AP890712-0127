HONG</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno packs the promise ofbillions of dollars for the environment and the world's poorestnations as he prepares for this week's Paris summit of majorindustrialized nations.   At the summit that begins Friday, Uno will pledge to increaseJapan's ``recycling of funds'' program for debt-ridden countries by$35 billion and extend the program until 1991, a Foreign Ministryofficial said late Wednesday.   The $35 billion is in addition to a three-year, $30 billionprogram that Japan started in 1987.   Japan, under international pressure to increase its Third Worldaid, started the ``recycling of funds'' program in the summer of1987 by offering $30 billion in public and private funds in loans todeveloping countries.   Officials from the Foreign Ministry and Finance Ministry said thenew package also will include $5.5 billion for the Brady plan, aprogram by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to help heavilyindebted countries reduce their debt burdens.   It also includes $10 billion over a three-year period through a``lending facility'' set up by the Japan Export-Import Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund, the officials said on condition ofanonymity.   Aid is expected to go to African nations, Brazil, Mexico, thePhilippines and Venezuela, said another Foreign Ministry official,who also requested anonymity.   Another $2.25 billion will be set aside for projects onenvironmental problems, he said, adding that another $600 millionwill be given in grants to the poorest of the world's developingcountries, mostly in Africa.   Recycling of funds refers to the Japanese government's plan touse part of its huge trade surplus as aid to developing countries.According to the Finance Ministry, Japan's trade surplus in 1988 was$77.39 billion, down from $79.71 billion in 1987.   The aid comes from the national budget; the Japan OverseasCooperation Fund, a government organization; the Export-Import Bank,which supplies money from both the government and the privatesector; and international institutes such as the IMF and World Bank,whose funding also comes from private firms and governments.   ``It is politically very important for Japanese leaders to makeit clear to the rest of the world its determination'' to increaseaid further, maintain economic growth without inflation, spurdomestic demand and open markets to foreign goods.   Uno left for Paris on Wednesday, leaving a government shaken bythe Recruit influence-peddling scandal, an unpopular 3 percent salestax and questions about his personal conduct.   Uno, the former foreign minister, on June 2 replaced PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned to take responsibility forthe scandal.   He has been besieged politically at home in the wake of asex-for-money scandal including allegations he maintained sexualrelations with geishas for more than a decade. He has denied doinganything immoral.   On Thursday, Uno will attend events celebrating the 200thanniversary of the French Revolution in Paris and grand opening ofthe new Bastille Opera House.   He is to return to Japan on Tuesday, five days before nationalelections for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.</TEXT></DOC>
