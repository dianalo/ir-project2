The U.S. Army Western Command (WESTCOM)/U.S. Army Support Command, Hawaii(USASCH) and U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center (CFSC) are inthe conceptual stage of planning the development of the Armed Forces RecreationCenter at Fort DeRussy, Waikiki, Hawaii. The development as funded, wouldoccur in several phases over about seven years. Nearly all structures nowused by the U.S. Army Reserve would be razed on an incremental basis, exceptfor Maluhia Hall in the northern corner of Fort DeRussy. In place of thesefacilities, Kalia Road would be rerouted and widened; two multi-level parkingstructures consisting of one parking structure in the vicinity of the existingPost Office and Saratoga Road and one DOD parking facility with dedicatedhotel parking would be constructed; a new 400-room hotel tower similarin appearance and in the vicinity of the existing Hale Koa Hotel wouldbe built; new arrival/entrance areas for the Hale Koa Hotal complex andHawaii Army Museum (Battery Randolph) would be constructed; and amenitiessuch as landscaping, outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities(tennis courts, putting courses, open fields, jogging paths, multipurposepavilions, etc.) would be provided. The relocation of the U.S. Army Reserveactivities to designated sites elsewhere and the construction of new facilitiesfor them will be addressed in this Environmental Assessment. In a futureincrement, Maluhia Hall will be renovated for post support activities.Open space will be expanded with a generally landscaped central land tosea corridor. 2. Alternatives to be considered include no action, various alignmentsof Kalia Road, alternate sitings of recreation/entertainment facilities,various designs and configurations of the proposed hotel, and phased relocationof the U.S. Army Reserve activities (only if existing buildings are usedor affect any new construction sites). 3. Potentially significant environmental concerns include possible impacton archaeological/historic resources; alteration of existing vehicluartraffic patterns associated with the realignment of Kalia Road; potentialincrease in vehicular air emissions associated with traffic flow, and parkingstructures; a shift from a predominantly military character (U.S. ArmyReserve) to a recreation/hotel character; effect on new view planes; increasein defacto visitor population; economic stimulation from construction andvisitor expenditures; and perceived public concerns on the alternativeuses of Fort DeRussy. 4. Public involvement and project scoping will consist of processing anotice of the project through the Areawide Clearinghouse; advertising theNotice of Intent in the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental QualityControl Bulletin, and through contacting local Neighborhood Boards andother community groups, affected government agencies, private organizations,and individuals. Public workshops to scope the EIS will be held but arenot yet scheduled. Public meeting will be held after distribution of theDEIS. All interested government agencies, planning advisory committees,and private organizations and individuals are encouraged to provide inputinto the study process, identifying potential environmental and socialconcerns and effects, and developing measures to avoid, ameliorate, ormitigate adverse environmental social impacts. 5. Coordination will be undertaken with adjoining land owners; the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency; other Federal agencies, State of Hawaiiagencies such as the Department of Health, Department of Land and NaturalResources, Department of Business and Economic Development, Departmentof Transportation, Office of State Planning, and Office of EnvironmentalQuality Control; City and County of Honolulu agencies such as Board ofWater Supply, Police Department, Fire Department, Department of Housingand Community Development, Department of Land Utilization, Department ofGeneral Planning, Department of Parks and Recreation, Department of PublicWorks, and Department of Transportation Services; and organizations suchas the Hawaii Visitors Bureau and the Waikiki Neighborhood Board. 6.
