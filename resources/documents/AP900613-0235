The decision has no relation to the fire on the Mega Borgsupertanker some 57 miles offshore from Galveston, Altstedter said.``It was made solely as a commercial decision,'' he said.   Under the decision, shipments of crude and fuel oils in tankersowned or operated by the Royal Dutch Shell Group will be limited tothe Louisiana Offshore Oil Port.   About 80 percent of the company's U.S. shipments of some 180,000barrels a day involve such oils, but only 40,000 barrels a day willbe affected by the decision, Altstedter said. The rest of theshipments already go to the port about 20 miles offshore Louisiana,he said.   The remainder of the company's U.S. shipments involve light oilproducts such as kerosene and gasoline and won't be affected by thedecision, he said.   The suspension came after a review of the risks and rewards tosuch trading in the United States, the spokesman said.   ``The U.S. has not yet ratified the international conventions,which limit liability,'' Altstedter said. ``And there's nolimitation on liability or the magnitude of legalities.''   Exxon Corp. was indicted in February on five federal chargesstemming from the grounding of the Valdez in March 1989. Thegovernment said it would seek at least $700 million in penaltiesfrom the oil company under a law that allows recovery of twice theamount of proven losses.   Exxon also has spent more than $2 billion to clean up the 11million gallons of crude released in the nation's worst oil spill.   The marine activities of Shell Oil Co. USA, the U.S. subsidiaryof Royal Dutch Shell, are not affected by the decision, officialssaid.   ``We don't own ships,'' said H.R. Hutchins, Shell USA spokesmanat the company's Houston headquarters. ``We charter everything fromgroups. Royal Dutch Shell is one of many groups we use. This willhave little or no effect on Shell Oil USA.''</TEXT></DOC>
