Practically the whole insurance industry, worried by thefailure of its investment returns to keep up with inflationin the late 1970s, plunged too deeply into real-estatelending. Many of the companies chased fat profits by becomingboth the major lender to and a part-owner of speculativeprojects and leveraged buy-outs. Some proved reluctant to cuttheir losses when they should have. And a few aggravatedtheir problems by throwing good money after bad.</LP><TEXT>   But Mutual Benefit made all those mistakes to an unusualdegree. And now the 146-year-old insurer, which weatheredeven the Great Depression without much difficulty, is payingthe price.   In the past several months, it has rapidly lost itsblue-chip status to become the latest symbol of the insuranceindustry's deepening problems. First, rating agenciesdowngraded the company's credit after looking at its loanportfolio. Then, many holders of big policies raced to pullout their money. And last week, New Jersey regulators seizedthe company in the largest state takeover of an insurer inU.S. history.   The 400,000 holders of Mutual Benefit policies have beentold that their policies will continue to be serviced byother insurers or a state-run Mutual Benefit. They areexpected to eventually get their full benefits. But for now,and perhaps for months, they can't withdraw any money.   How could a long-established insurer fall into such amess?   Part of the blame, according to current and formerexecutives at Mutual Benefit, must be shouldered by Ted D.Simmons, the company's investment chief throughout the 1980s,who took early retirement last January to take charge ofchurch construction for the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints. During his tenure, the company lentbillions in joint ventures with such eclectic deal makers asBilly Rebozo, a nephew of Richard Nixon confidant Charles&quot;Bebe&quot; Rebozo, and a leveraged buy-out firm founded by formerTreasury Secretary William E. Simon. And it concentrated itslending so that, to a remarkable degree, its portfolio lackedadequate diversification.   In an interview, Mr. Simmons acknowledges that some of hismost spectacular loans haven't worked out so far -- though heargues that they will eventually pay off. He also notes thatthe investments weren't his &quot;sole decision,&quot; that the lateRobert van Fossan, the company's longtime chairman, &quot;alsoplayed a key role.&quot; In addition, Mr. Simmons and severalother current and former executives of Mutual Benefit,looking at its overall loan portfolio, say they can't believethat the ultimate losses will be as large as regulatorsindicate.   The prime example of the big, ill-fated loans: MutualBenefit backed a condominium development on Fisher Island,near Miami, Fla., that has been plagued by one mishap afteranother, including multiyear disputes over eagles' nestinggrounds and sewer pipes. The insurer has been lending to thehuge, extraordinarily lavish project for at least 11 years;so far, less than a third of the condos have been sold.   Mutual Benefit also was hurt by management upheavals atcrucial stages in the late 1980s. Top management wasdisrupted first by the death in office of Mr. van Fossan andthen by a battle for succession between Mr. Simmons and HenryKates, who eventually won the chairmanship.   But interviews with company executives, competitors andregulators trace the insurer's worst troubles back to itsstrategy of both lending to and investing in big projects.Many insurance companies count on such joint lender-ownerarrangements to eventually generate big payoffs that willcompensate for the high risks of the initial investments. Butwhen trouble hit, Mutual Benefit, hoping to profit somedayfrom its ownership stakes, tied its future ever more tightlyto these pet projects by lending them even more money.   This month, New Jersey regulators said Mutual Benefit hada stunning $1.1 billion of its $14 billion of assets tied upin four problem loans. Two involved unfinished Florida condodevelopments; two involved companies taken private inleveraged buy-outs. Several of the ventures had stoppedpaying cash interest last year on at least part of theirdebt. Yet Mutual Benefit was so eager to keep its bigborrowers afloat that it increased its loans to one debtor bynearly $100 million last year.   And because of the insurance industry's liberal accountingstandards, Mutual Benefit could, in its 1990 accounts,represent all four loans as healthy. In fact, Mr. Kates, thenthe chairman, even told a meeting of 150 sales agents lastMarch that the company had just completed its &quot;best yearever&quot; and that net income was up. Mr. Kates, who recentlyresigned, declines to comment.   Whether Mutual Benefit's real-estate problems are typicalof other insurers is an issue of urgent debate. RichardSchweiker, president of the American Council of LifeInsurance, contends that Mutual Benefit's problems areunique. &quot;They had a very aggressive investment strategy,&quot; Mr.Schweiker says. But Orin Kramer, an industry consultant,argues that Mutual Benefit is &quot;symptomatic of insurancecompanies' true exposure: commercial real estate.&quot;   U.S. life insurers' real-estate loans and investmentstotal $280 billion, mostly on commercial properties andrepresenting about 22% of their assets. Most of theproperties aren't as troubled as Mutual Benefit's bigprojects, but they are subject to the same pressures ofoversupply and weak demand that have depressed rents andreal-estate values nationwide.   Mutual Benefit, which, as a mutual insurance company, isowned by its policyholders, has long ranked among the 50largest U.S. life insurers. Until recently, it was known fora pristine, albeit somewhat stuffy image. &quot;They're a placewhere a handshake really means something,&quot; says one longtimeNew York client.   Like other mutual insurers, Mutual Benefit faced two bigproblems in the early 1980s. Returns on its investmentportfolio -- consisting mostly of mortgages yielding about 8%-- lagged far behind inflation. And potential customers werebeing lured away by mutual funds and universal lifeinsurance, a potentially high-yielding product offered by themore innovative shareholder-owned life insurance companies.   Mutual Benefit responded by aggressively sellingmarket-rate investments known as guaranteed investmentcontracts to pension funds, taking in billions of dollarsthat way. Simultaneously, Mr. Simmons' investment departmentpursued bolder real-estate investments that it thought wouldincrease investment income. &quot;People looked at real estate asthe best hedge there was against inflation,&quot; explains StephenCarlotti, the company's recently appointed chief executiveofficer.   Two of Mr. Simmons' ambitious real-estate projects, FisherIsland and Williams Island, both involved converting raw landin South Florida into huge luxury-condo developments.Partners such as Billy Rebozo provided designs for 1,047condo units at Fisher Island, an 86-slip marina, grass tenniscourts and the conversion of an old Vanderbilt mansion into acountry club.   Starting in 1979, Mutual Benefit provided the cash. &quot;Theexpectation was that we'd get our money back&quot; once condoswere sold, Mr. Simmons says. If everything went as planned,Mutual Benefit eventually expected to make a $250 millionprofit on a Fisher Island investment that began at $100million.   But trouble plagued both projects. At Fisher Island,developers spent years getting permits to put sewer pipesunder a deep ship channel. Australian pines overran theisland and had to be cut down -- repeatedly.Environmentalists complained that eagles' nesting areas wouldbe disturbed. Building the condos &quot;made the new Shorehampower plant look like an easy job,&quot; Mr. Carlotti says,referring to the New York nuclear site.   By the end of 1989, Mutual Benefit had sunk $215 millionin loans and equity investments into Fisher Island. Less than25% of the proposed condo units had been built and sold. Theysold at a pace of about 80 a year -- a rate that wouldn'tfill the entire development until the year 2000.   Other lenders might have cut their losses or demanded thatthe owners bring in new partners to share the costs. But as amajor owner of Fisher and Williams islands, Mutual Benefitkept lending. By the end of last year, it had $295 million ofloans and equity investments tied up in Fisher Island, Mr.Carlotti says, and some loans weren't paying cash interest.But Mutual Benefit simply let the principal increase by theamount of interest due and credited the difference asinterest income.   Mr. Simmons and current Mutual Benefit executives say theybelieve the Fisher and Williams investments will eventuallyprove to be winners. But this month, New Jersey's deputysuperintendent of insurance, Jasper Jackson, declared that itwould take a cash infusion of $110 million to $250 million toconvert the two projects into &quot;performing&quot; investments.   Mutual Benefit sank into a similar quagmire when itdecided to finance two leveraged buy-outs. At first, itstarted small, lending $30 million to help finance theacquisition of Ernst Home Centers Inc. in 1986. Then, in1988, it lent $45 million to help Wesray Capital Corp., thebuy-out firm founded by former Treasury Secretary Simon,acquire William Carter Co., a maker of baby clothes.   From the outset, the Carter loan was ranked as risky bythe National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ButMutual Benefit got a steep 13.5% interest rate on the loan,as well as a small equity stake in the company.   Within a couple years, both Ernst and Carter had troublepaying their debts. Rather than declare default, MutualBenefit made a fateful decision to convert its debt intomajority ownership of both companies and to stand by to lendmore money. In the case of Ernst, Mutual Benefit agreed toguarantee a $150 million bank loan. In Carter's case,requests for more cash quickly followed, and Mutual Benefit'sloans to the company grew to $78 million in 1990. Carter's1990 operating profit, at $8 million, didn't cover its debtbills, so -- again -- the loan was increased, and the newloans were treated on Mutual Benefit's books as interestincome. But Carter's heaviest borrowing was yet to come.   Mutual Benefit's regulatory filings show that on 37separate occasions in the 1991 first quarter, Mutual Benefitlent more money to Carter. Mutual Benefit officials termthose loans routine, designed to finance seasonal wintermanufacturing costs before the apparel company's big springselling season. Overall, the loans raised Mutual Benefit'sCarter exposure by more than $14 million.   Regulators are dismayed by both buy-out loans. &quot;To convertthe investments into performing ones,&quot; New Jersey's Mr.Jackson wrote in an affidavit filed in connection with thestate's takeover, &quot;between $150 million to $250 million wouldneed to be invested into the leveraged buy-outs.&quot;   On a smaller scale, Mutual Benefit stumbled when it beganfinancing a realestate brokerage franchiser calledHelp-U-Sell. Mr. Simmons says he believed Mutual Benefit'sagents could also become real-estate brokers for Help-U-Sell,and vice versa. The ensuing &quot;synergies,&quot; he adds, weresupposed to provide tidy profits.   The insurer initially invested $3 million in Help-U-Sell,but that has grown to at least $14 million as the real-estateslump slowed franchise sales. More trouble may lie ahead.Some angry franchisees say they didn't know that BlaineHarris, Help-U-Sell's chairman, was disciplined in a previousjob by the National Association of Securities Dealers. Somefranchisees say that if that had known, they would havethought twice about investing.   Mr. Harris says the $2,500 NASD fine concerned a minorviolation of capital rules and didn't have to be disclosed inthe Help-U-Sell prospectus. &quot;This company has worked veryhard to be 100% straightup in everything we do,&quot; he adds.   The festering problems in Mutual Benefit's investmentportfolio were aggravated when Mr. van Fossan died in October1989, leaving its directors with unclear instructions on hissuccession. Though Mr. Kates had been president and chiefexecutive, some board members began debating whether Mr.Simmons should be named chairman. Ultimately, Mr. Kates waschosen, but insiders say the battle caused a split among sometop managers.   Management harmony wouldn't have saved the company when itentered its tailspin, however. After Mr. Kates told the boardthe severity of the company's problems -- a few weeks beforehe had reassured the sales agents -- he began lookingfeverishly for a merger partner. He first turned toPrudential Insurance Co. of America, also based in Newark.   &quot;They spent one day looking at it and turned us down,&quot; oneMutual Benefit insider says. Next, the company turned toMetropolitan Life Insurance Co., of New York; it also saidno.   After news of failed merger talks with Metropolitan leakedout, and the credit-rating companies downgraded MutualBenefit on Friday, May 17, the mood of its agents soured. Thenext day, Mr. Kates began a weekend meeting with agents atthe opulent Phoenician Hotel in Phoenix, Ariz. Few at themeeting enjoyed their luxurious surroundings, however.&quot;Everyone was in a panic. Some of the fellas got up andcried,&quot; says Marvin Mayer, general agent of one of thecompany's largest agencies.   By the next Monday, policyholders were already filingrequests to withdraw money. In the following weeks, a trickleof surrender requests turned into a flood, mounting to atotal of $550 million by July 3, Mr. Carlotti says. On July16, regulators received court approval for the seizure.   Mutual Benefit's run, which nearly exhausted its cash injust two months, proved that insurers are vulnerable to apanic by policyholders. Also taking a pounding is thehigh-risk investment strategy that Mutual Benefit hadembraced.   &quot;Everyone wants to judge what we've done with 20-20hindsight,&quot; Mr. Carlotti says. &quot;I've been involved with a lotof investment decisions. They all made sense at the time.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          HENRY KATES is former president and chief executiveofficer of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., Newark, N.J.His title was misstated in a previous edition.
