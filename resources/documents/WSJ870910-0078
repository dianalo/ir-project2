Heinz to BuyWhat It Hopes IsA Hot Potato Idea---French-Fry Vending MachineCooks Spuds in Oil Fast,May Create Niche Market---By Rick WartzmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HNZTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   In a move some analysts dismissed as small potatoes, H.J. Heinz Co. agreed to acquire the owner of the patent rights for a vending machine that sells french fries.    The Pittsburgh-based food processor said yesterday its Ore-Ida Foods Inc. unit agreed to purchase Friteco Inc., a small McLean, Va.-based research concern. Terms weren't disclosed.    While not all analysts were especially hot on the idea, others said Heinz has successfully tapped market niches like this before. For instance, its Weight Watchers International Inc. unit started as a little idea but has grown into a highly lucrative business. Moreover, this type of targeting of specialty markets is becoming increasingly common within the industry as a whole.    &quot;Look at the microwave popcorn business,&quot; said Stephen Carnes, an industry analyst at Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc. &quot;That was nothing five years ago, and it's grown to $400 million in retail sales alone. Heinz's move makes a lot of sense.&quot;    From the outside, the fry machines, intended to be placed beside soft-drink and candy bar dispensers, would work like any other vending machine: Plop in some change and 35 seconds later out comes piping hot shoestring spuds. From the inside, the workings are more complicated. Most remarkably, company officials say, is that the fries are cooked in oil, not microwaved.    &quot;We'll test market this over the next two or three years,&quot; Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, Heinz's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said after the annual meeting yesterday. &quot;Significant capital costs will be involved in developing this.&quot;    Heinz researchers themselves had been trying to develop a similar machine for at least a decade, but their tests kept resulting in nasty grease fires. </TEXT></DOC>
