Ronald Carey,RCAS program manager, presented the RFP and a 34,000-page functionaldescription to vendors.andP;  Carey was joined by sevedral senior officials fromteh defense Department and the General Services Administration.andM;GSA was represented by Administrator Richard Austin and Frank McDonough,assistant commissioner of GSA's Information Resources Management Service, whopresented Carey with a delegation of procurement authority.andM;The DPA come Dec. 27 after GSA officials were assyred RCAS would be fieldedincrementally in phases and would use FTS 2000 for data communications, a GSAspokesman said.andM;The draft RFP issued in June had spacified the use of the Defense DataNetwork to transmit data among 5,000 reserve sites nationwide.andP;  But Careysaid the final RFP calls for use of FTS 2000.andM;DOD and GSA officials have been unable to agree on Defense Department use ofFTS 2000 despite congressional passage of a law requiring agencies to use thefederal telecommunications system.andP;  Kenneth Touloumes, chief ofauthorizations and management reviews for IRMS, said the FTS question forRCAS was decided as others in the Defense Department might be -- &quot;on acase-by-case basis.&quot;andM;In brief remarks at the ceremony, both Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Herbert R. Temple Jr., whoretires as chief of the National Guard Bureau this month, and Maj.andP;  Gen.andO;William F. Ward, chief of the Army Reserve, said RCAS will be a significantstep in bringing the reserve's wartime mobilization capability tocontemporary standards.andM;Praise for CareyandM;Temple praised Carey and his staff of about 50, which took control of RCAS in1988 after a frustrated Congress removed management authority over theprogram from the active Army and transferred it to the National Buard Bureau.andM;Ward termed RCAS &quot;a bright opportunity for the reserves, the Army and theDOD,&quot; but said &quot;the most important aspect of this program is that it willmake life better for the soldiers out there who currently slave under acascading torrent of paperwork.&quot;andM;The RFP said the system will give 10,000 reserve units at 5,000 sites desktopcomputing and advanced communications capability.andP;  The RFP calls for officeautomation, telecommunications, distributed databases and distributedprocessing capability.andM;RCAS functions are three-pronged, Carey said, separated into modules formobilization execution, mobilization planning and peacetime administrativefunctions.andM;Computerized EvaluationandM;Initial proposals are due April 30.andP;  In the two-phase procurement,contracting officials will select two finalist contractor teams for acompute-off in 1991, to be conducted at vendor sites but in conjunction withactual reserve units.andP;  Each finalist will be paid up to $15 million todevelop a prototype for the critical elements of the system, Carey said.andM;In remarks directed at vendors, Carey said a &quot;computerized evaluationprocess&quot; and graphic projections will beused to evaluate proposals.andP;  &quot;We'llput the RFP on one side of the screen and your proposal on the other side andcompare them,&quot; he said.andM;The final RCAS contractor team will have until 1994 to deploy the system,which Carey said will be developed in blocks.andM;GSA officials had raised the concern that RCAS would be fielded as a &quot;granddesign&quot; system, in a single, unbreakable structure.andP;  Both Carey and DavidBorland, director of the Army's Information Systems Selection and AcquisitionAgency, who will make the RCAS buy, said RCAS always was planned as a systemthat would be fielded in careful stages.andP;  But GSA needed reassurances,Borland said.andM;In a recent interview, Carey said RCAS often is perceived as a grand designbecause of its size.andM;&quot;The program is large.andP;  It's going tobe fielded in thousands of locations,but it's not a complex program,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Industry does this kind of thingevery day.&quot;andM;Nonetheless, in response to comments from GSA and vendors, the major revisionto the final RFP was &quot;a better definition of the block concept,&quot; said DonnaMcKalip, an RCAS manager.andM;Carey said the functional description will be updated often but contractorswill develop their proposals based on the document as it appeared with theRFP.andM;&quot;The target you're aiming at is fixed,&quot; he told vendors, saying that onlyafter a final contractor team is selected will alterations to the descriptionbe issued.andM;The reserves may need as many as 28,000 microcomputers for RCAS, officialshave said.andP;  The prime contractor can obtain those machines through thedesktop III requirements contract with Unisys Corp., Carey said.andP;  However,some officials said they would be surprised if the prime contractor usesDesktop III.andM;Sources within the RCAS program and the vendor community have identifiedseveral companies likely to bid on the system as prime integrators withhardware suppliers as their partners.andM;Among them are Boeing Corp. and Science Applications International Corp. SAIChas announced it is teaming with ATandamp;T Co., and one source said Boeing wasnegotiating with Computer Sciences Corp.andM;Others expected to bid in one capacity or another are General Dynamics Corp.,andO;IBM Corp., BIDM International Inc. and Electronic Data Systems Corp.andP;  Asource said that as of last month TRW Inc. -- long interested in RCAS -- hadnot yet made a final decision.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
