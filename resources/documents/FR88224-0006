No comments were received.After careful review of the available data, the FAA has determined thatair safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule asproposed.It is estimated that 50 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 2 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe optional modification, and that the average labor cost will be $40per manhour. Based on these figures, the cost for an operator to incorporatethe optional modification is estimated to be $80 per airplane.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979) and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities becauseof the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($80). A final evaluationhas been prepared for this regulation and has been placed in the docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
