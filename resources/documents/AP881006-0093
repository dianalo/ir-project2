Augusto Pinochet's bidto extend his presidency until 1997.   The reaction was similar in Britain, Spain and France, wherelawmakers hailed the decision by voters to reject Pinochet inWednesday's national referendum. Open elections are to be held nextyear for the first time since 1970.   In Athens, spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said Greece's Socialistgovernment was ``pleased about the advance of the democraticopposition ... and will salute with complete satisfaction theirfinal predominance.''   Britain's Foreign Office said the government was encouraged.   ``We hope that the plebiscite result, which appears to reflectthe will of the Chilean people, will represent an important firststep on the path back towards full democracy,'' a statement said.   The West German government called on Chile's military leaders toabide by terms for the nation's democratization.   ``We hope that the government will now hold to its own promisedtimetable and continue on a course to allow open and freeelections,'' said government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling.   Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat, said:``The government over which I am presiding pledges to be near theChilean people in the difficult struggle for the conquest ofdemocracy.''   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, also a Christian Democrat,said in a statement that ``the victory of the opposition is veryimportant. The historic tradition of Chile is democratic.''   Italy was the scene of numerous demonstrations when Pinochetseized power in a 1973 coup that ousted President Salvador Allende,a Marxist. Through the years, many Chileans have taken exile inItaly.   In Britain, George Foulkes, a foreign affairs spokesman for theopposition Labor Party, was among 500 foreigners called to Chile byopposition groups there to act as election observers.   ``It's a tremendous triumph for democracy in Chile, a totallyunique situation where a dictator has been voted out in aplebiscite,'' Foulkes said.   ``It is absolutely crucial now to ensure that Pinochet fullyaccepts the decision of the Chilean people,'' he said.   Jacques Arnold, a lawmaker in the governing Conservative Partyand secretary of the House of Commons Latin American Group, notedthat Pinochet was not without support.   ``The most important thing is that despite all the cards againsthim, particularly on human rights, this old man of 72 achieved aconsiderable vote,'' he said.   All Spanish political parties represented in Parliament hailedthe referendum's outcome.   ``The triumph of the `no' (vote) represents the rejection by themajority of a dictatorial regime and the process that the regimedesigned to perpetuate its hold on power,'' a statement from thegoverning Spanish Socialist party said.   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said ``thepeople of Chile have given a great lesson of political maturity.''   Pierre Mauroy, first secretary of the French Socialist Party anda former premier, called the vote ``an immense victory, after 15years of dictatorship and suffering.''   Laurent Fabius, speaker of the French National Assembly, said onFrench radio the result was ``a great day'' for Chile.   ``It's a country which suffered terribly for 15 years ... andnow, all of a sudden, there is light and hope again,'' he said.   In Brussels, Belgium, an official of the European EconomicCommunity Commission said the referendum result showed that inChile and elsewhere ``man triumphs as he fights for liberty and therespect of his fundamental rights.''   Claude Cheysson, the EEC's commissioner for North-South matter,also urged Chilean authorities to restore democracy as quickly aspossible.</TEXT></DOC>
