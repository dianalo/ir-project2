The Justice Department had just given a $15 million slapon the wrist to Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International inthe biggest money-laundering case in history. At the time,the Bush administration was advocating the death penalty fordrug kingpins. Shouldn't the government be tougher on banksthat launder their money? Mr. Bennett wondered.</LP><TEXT>   The comment put Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on thedefensive. &quot;There is no death penalty for banks,&quot; he shotback, according to people who attended the meeting.   In fact, Mr. Bennett noted, there is a death penalty forbanks -- shutting them down. Which is exactly what a globalcadre of banking regulations did to BCCI on July 5 -- fully18 months after the Justice Department had BCCI in its graspand let it go. By the time of the seizure, the suspectedlooting at the bank had reached roughly $5 billion, possiblymuch more.   Why has the Justice Department failed to bring morecharges in &quot;the largest bank fraud in world financialhistory,&quot; as Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthaucalled it this week?   Some conspiracy theorists see the fine hand of the CentralIntelligence Agency at work. The CIA, after all, is known tohave done some secret banking at BCCI branches. Although theJustice Department flatly denies it, could federalprosecutors be protecting covert operations?   Or, more sinister still, are the Republicans engaging inpolitical damage control, as some Democratic investigators onCapitol Hill have suggested? There was about $18 million ofarms money in the Iran-Contra affair that went through BCCIaccounts in Monaco. And Robert Genzman, Republican counsel onthe Iran-Contra committee, would later become the U.S.attorney in Tampa who made the deal with BCCI. Mr. Genzmanhas said his two roles aren't remotely linked.   And certainly to some degree, superpower lawyering helpedkeep the feds off the trail. A number of congressionalcommittees have scheduled hearings that will hear testimonyon Justice's handling of the case, including one hearingscheduled for this morning.   But the Justice Department's most compelling incentive totread lightly may be rooted in the one case in which it hadthe bank in its clutches -- the Tampa case. The reason isManuel Noriega.   The Panamanian dictator used BCCI as his personal bank. Anumber of law-enforcement officials -- a White House aide anda former U.S. attorney among them -- note that in thesettlement of the money-laundering case, BCCI officialsagreed to cooperate in the prosecution of Mr. Noriega. Inexchange, the feds dropped all charges against the bank'sparent, BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.; two subsidiariespleaded guilty to reduced charges and forfeited the $15million.   Politically, a lot was on the line: President Bush hadjustified the U.S. invasion of Panama in part by saying Mr.Noriega had to be tried as a drug criminal. In settling thecase on terms so palatable to BCCI, the Justice Departmentwas &quot;blinded by the prospect of getting evidence on Noriega,&quot;says William von Raab, the Republican former head of theCustoms Service, which began investigating BCCI in 1987.   Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller defends the pleabargain, contending that because of a hostile judge, thegovernment wasn't likely to win as big a fine at trial. Hedeclines to comment on what, if anything, the government haslearned from BCCI about Mr. Noriega.   The consequences of the department's action may be greaterthan most people realize even now. The U.S. attorney's officein Tampa agreed in writing to let BCCI off the hook for awide range of other potential crimes.   Specifically, in the plea-bargain arrangement worked outwith lawyers for BCCI, the U.S. attorney's office in Tampaagreed it would never charge the bank or its affiliates &quot;withcommitting any other federal criminal offenses underinvestigation or known to the government at the time of theexecution of this agreement or relating in any manner to thecharges&quot; disposed of by the deal.   &quot;The Justice Department basically threw away the potentialcase,&quot; charges Mr. von Raab, the former Customs chief.Justice Department officials maintain that the waiver offuture charges applies only to the Tampa prosecutor's office,although they acknowledge that defense lawyers could easilycontest the issue.   Justice Department officials angrily insist that they havepursued BCCI vigorously. The only U.S. convictions yetobtained against the rogue bank or its employees occurred inthe Tampa case; five BCCI officials were tried, found guiltyand sentenced to prison terms of as much as 12 years. AndAttorney General Dick Thornburgh says through a spokesmanthat &quot;an aggressive investigation of further allegationsinvolving BCCI is continuing&quot; -- in Tampa, Miami, Atlanta andWashington. Senior Thornburgh aides promise indictments thismonth.   But critics from both parties see a pattern in which theagency has received screaming leads yet failed to listen, orcertainly failed to follow up in any meaningful way.   Mr. Morgenthau, the district attorney in Manhattan, hascharged that federal prosecutors denied him access to keywitnesses and evidence in his probe of BCCI, in which thebank was indicted this week. Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.),whose staff dug up some of the early leads on BCCI'sdrug-related activities, likewise contends that untilrecently the Justice Department displayed &quot;no visibleevidence of energy or staff or pursuing the investigativetrail.&quot;   Why, for instance, did the agency wait until only a fewmonths ago to focus on allegations that BCCI secretly boughtcontrol of First American Bankshares, Washington's largestbank-holding company? As early as April 1989, Sen. Kerry'sstaff had provided the department with taped debriefings of asenior BCCI official describing the BCCI-First Americanrelationship, as well as other evidence of wrongdoing. Kerrystaffers even arranged for Justice Department prosecutors tomeet the witness.   The Justice Department indicated that it wasn'tinterested, saying it &quot;didn't have the manpower&quot; to debriefthe witness, a former staffer recalls. Frustrated, one formerstaffer took the witness to Mr. Morgenthau. Mr. Muellerresponds curtly that no one on Capitol Hill is &quot;privy to whatwe have done&quot; with the evidence.   The federal BCCI probe, he says, has been slowed by thedifficulty of unraveling the Byzantine dealings of asecretive $20 billion bank that operated in 70 countries.&quot;The investigation becomes even more difficult,&quot; Mr. Muellersays, &quot;when witnesses and evidence are found principallyoverseas and are not subject to the subpoena power of thegrand jury.&quot;   Of course, the county district attorney in Manhattan facedthe same obstacles. Despite the tension between the twoprosecuting agencies, Attorney General Thornburgh called theNew York prosecutor Monday to congratulate him. But thefeelings don't appear mutual: In a long list of agenciesthanked for assisting his probe, Mr. Morgenthau didn'tinclude the Justice Department.   ---   Peter Truell contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
