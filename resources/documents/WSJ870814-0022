But the company said it still intends to raise some other tariffs in November. Sir George Jefferson, its chairman, said the move was prompted by British Telecom's &quot;strong financial position.&quot; He didn't estimate the net effect of the price announcements on revenue, but analysts said it would be neglible.    British publisher Robert Maxwell said he won't make a hostile bid for the Dutch publishing group ELSEVIER NV. Mr. Maxwell's statement came after a meeting in London with two top directors of the Dutch company. Rumors had been circulating in Britain and the Netherlands for more than a month about the possibility of Mr. Maxwell's BRITISH PRINTING andamp; COMMUNICATIONS CORP. merging with Elsevier. Trading in Elsevier shares was temporarily suspended on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange last week amid rumors that British Printing was about to make an offer for the Dutch concern. Mr. Maxwell's company owns 8.5% of Elsevier's stock. </TEXT></DOC>
