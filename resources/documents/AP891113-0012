The space agency hopes the launch will produce the mostcomprehensive observations ever of the early universe and theprocesses that shaped it to form stars and galaxies.   The $150 million Cosmic Background Explorer, a 16-by-28-footsatellite, will be boosted into orbit 559 miles above Earth byNASA's last unmanned rocket, said George Diller, an agencyspokesman.   The Vandenberg Air Force Base launch had been scheduled forFriday but has been delayed until at least Nov. 19 to replace amalfunctioning guidance computer on the two-stage Delta rocket.   The 116-foot rocket that will lift the 5,000-pound Explorer intoorbit will be the 184th Delta launched by the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration and the last expendable rocket NASA willever launch, Diller said.   NASA stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s, deciding tolaunch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory wasexhausted. After the 1986 Challenger explosion, NASA said it waswrong to rely on the shuttle. Then President Reagan ordered theagency to stop launching commercial payloads and give such businessto private industry.   After a 30-day shakedown, the solar-powered Explorer will spendup to two years using three sensitive detectors to study how theuniverse and its stars and galaxies developed, program scientistLarry Caroff said from Washington.   The instruments will measure ``cosmic background'' radiation.Such radiation is different than dangerous ionizing radiation. Itincludes microwaves, infrared light and ``submillimeter'' radiationleft over from the big bang _ the gargantuan explosion thatscientists believe was the fireball of creation.   ``If God created the universe, he or she did it about 15 billionyears ago _ and did it with a bang,'' Caroff said.   In an instant, a single point of matter expanded explosivelyinto a hot, dense and extraordinarily uniform sphere of gascontaining electrically charged particles, according to the theory.   ``Think of a sphere with us at the center,'' Caroff said. Thesurface ``is moving away from us very fast, glowing and emittingradiation. That sphere is the hot gas characteristic of the earlyuniverse. We have to look very, very far back in time, which meansvery far out in the universe, to see that hot surface.''   By measuring cosmic background radiation, the Explorer will lookback to certain times in the history of the universe, he explained.   One of Explorer's instruments will measure infrared light, orheat, emitted when the first atoms are believed to have formed500,000 years after the big bang. That will help scientists learnif, between three minutes to 500,000 years after the big bang, theuniverse was shaped by exotic phenomena such as black holes, whichare so dense their gravity sucks in light.   The satellite's microwave sensor will look for differences inthe brightness of cosmic background radiation to determine if thebig bang's fireball was equally bright in all directions.   ``Out of that extraordinarily uniform collection of hot mattereventually had to come galaxies and stars _ what is obviously avery lumpy distribution of matter,'' Caroff said. ``The seeds ofthat lumpiness must have been present in the early universe, andthe (microwave) instrument is meant to look for those seeds.''   Explorer's third sensor will search for a burst of luminousinfrared and submillimeter radiation that scientists believed wasproduced when the first stars and galaxies formed 200 million yearsafter the big bang.   Telescopes ``can see distant galaxies a few billion years backin time, but nothing like this,'' Caroff said. ``This will be thefirst time anyone will be able to see evidence of the formation ofthe first galaxies.''   Caroff said the Explorer mission's cost includes $150 millionfor the satellite and sensors, $70 million for the rocket andlaunch and $160 million for manpower at NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter in Maryland. About $20 million is for operations and dataanalysis through the end of the mission.</TEXT></DOC>
