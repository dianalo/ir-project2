The two companies said also they have ended a legal battle connected with the scotched nuclear plant that a Consumers spokesman called &quot;the longest-running, most expensive, most contentious in the state's history.&quot;    Consumers Power and Dow reached an agreement in principle on the project last September and provided details at a news conference yesterday. The conversion represents a big step for Jackson, Mich.-based Consumers Power in its efforts to extricate itself from the financial morass created when it ran out of construction funds for Midland and finally abandoned the nuclear plant. In late 1985, Consumers Power, Michigan's largest utility, wrote off about $500 million of the plant. But even though it now will be able to use a large chunk of assets in the conversion, the utility still has another $2.1 billion of remaining Midland assets to recover.    Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical, meanwhile, will now have a source for the steam and electricity it needs to run its Michigan division plants and will gain the added benefit of having an equity interest in the plant. The company had initially planned to buy power from the now-abandoned nuclear plant.    Under the agreement, about $600 million in new capital will be invested to build the gas-fired plant. Dow Chemical has chipped in $115 million and gets a 10% equity position in the project. Other equity partners, whom Consumers Power and Dow expect will be named in the spring, will take a 41% interest. Consumers Power said the additional $485 million in new capital will come from these other equity partners and from bank loans taken out by the partnership.    Consumers Power will get the remaining 49% stake by contributing $1.5 billion in equipment and materials already at the Midland site. The company, which said earlier that it only would be contributing $1 billion in assets, increased that figure by the amount it says represents the portion of the nuclear plant originally dedicated to supplying Dow Chemical.    Consumers Power had said it had hoped to recover that $500 million in its litigation with Dow, which resulted when Dow canceled its contract to buy steam from Midland in 1983. The two companies had sued each other over the contract.    In return for its $1.5 billion contribution of assets to the partnership, Consumers Power will receive, in addition to its equity stake, $1.27 billion in interest-bearing notes, which have varying maturity dates, that will be paid off by the partnership from future cash flow. The company also has the option to convert $103 million of the notes to a cash payment of $103 million at any time. It said that in addition it will be paid $16 million annually for nine years after commercial operation of the plant begins.    The two companies said the plant will be completed in phases, with the first coming on line by early 1990. When it is at full capacity, the plant is expected to produce 1,300,000 kilowatts of electricity. Dow plans to buy as much as 75,000 kilowatts from the cogeneration plant on an average annual basis.    Consumers Power will buy the remaining electricity and sell it to customers. Cogeneration plants produce both steam and electricity and are usually owned by businesses that use a portion of the power themselves and sell the rest to local utilities.    Consumers Power said power from the plant will cost 10% to 15% more than current average electric rates, an estimate that critics of the plan argue is far too low. Some consumer advocates have also argued that the complicated project is merely a way for the utility to pass along the expense of the Midland project to customers and that a new gas-fired plant should cost far less than what the Consumers Power-Dow venture forecasts.    William T. McCormick, chairman and chief executive officer of Consumers Power, said the company expects to recover a &quot;significant part&quot; of the remaining $2.1 billion in Midland assets through a rate case pending before the Michigan Public Service Commission. He said the company also plans to discuss with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc. &quot;their obligations&quot; because of certain construction problems that contributed to the nuclear plant being abandoned. A Bechtel unit was the architect-engineer and constructor at Midland.    At Bechtel, a spokesman said, &quot;We would be pleased to continue our discussions with Consumers on the resolution of our differences and we hope that this would result in a role for us in the completion of this project.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Consumers Power closed at $16.75, up $1. Dow Chemical rose 87.5 cents, to $70.625. </TEXT></DOC>
