Siegel and Dennis B. Levine to dismiss claims against them in two civil lawsuits brought against arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky and others.    The lawsuits were brought by investors in Mr. Boesky's former partnership. Messrs. Siegel and Levine, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the Boesky insider-trading scandal, were included in the lawsuits as alleged co-conspirators who helped defraud Mr. Boesky's investors.    The two former investment bankers claimed in their motion that they couldn't be liable, because they didn't owe any legal duty to the Boesky limited partners and didn't have any direct involvement in the formation of Mr. Boesky's partnership.    But Judge Milton Pollack, who is presiding over 13 civil suits involving Mr. Boesky, said Messrs. Levine and Siegel were properly included in the partners' suits, since the charges &quot;raise a reasonable inference that Levine and Siegel continued to conspire with Boesky throughout the partnership's conception, creation, promotion and capitalization. This is a triable issue.&quot;    Audrey Strauss, a lawyer representing Mr. Siegel, denied that Mr. Siegel conspired with Mr. Boesky at any time relevant to the partnership. She noted that &quot;the government didn't allege that Mr. Siegel provided information to Mr. Boesky after 1984,&quot; which is prior to formation of the Boesky partnership. Mr. Levine's attorney couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
