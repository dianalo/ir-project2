Gregorio Honasan had been diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars of weapons, communications gear and other supplies from Philippine armed forces channels, Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the armed forces chief of staff, said in an interview.    In an effort to bolster sagging military morale and a much-weakened, post-coup civilian leadership, Gen. Ramos has attempted in recent days to counter a propaganda blitz by Col. Honasan, who is in hiding not far from Manila, with one of his own. While Manila is swept by daily rumors of imminent new coup attempts, Gen. Ramos asserts that the military is in position to prevent any new attack from coming as close to success as Col. Honasan's Aug. 28 attempt, in which rebels penetrated armed forces and air force headquarters and controlled several television stations and numerous provincial military bases.    Yesterday, police arrested as many as 20 people in raids carried out on suspected rebel hideouts in central Manila hours before a new coup attempt, the head of police intelligence said. He said renegade soldiers loyal to ousted President Ferdinand Marcos were preparing to take power and were hoping to get the support of Col. Honasan.    &quot;There are reports of some people making another attempt,&quot; Gen. Alexander Aguirre, Manila's military commander said. &quot;The raid was aimed at pre-empting the coup,&quot; Col. Juanito Lagasca, chief of police intelligence, said.    Gen. Ramos said Col. Honasan retains the capability to launch hit-and-run attacks. The general estimated Col. Honasan's forces at no more than 500 men. Gen. Ramos said Col. Honasan and his allies in the officers corps had begun stockpiling equipment during the rule of Mr. Marcos and had continued under President Corazon Aquino.    The armed forces chief expressed frustration over the failure to apprehend Col. Honasan, who has been giving a series of interviews to reporters who are driven blindfolded to his hiding place. The interviews add up to a political attack on President Aquino, as well as the military leadership. &quot;He is painting himself as idealistic, but power acquisition was his real objective. He's talking politics now,&quot; Gen. Ramos said.    Gen. Ramos noted that the colonel, who is regularly described in Manila newspapers as a Rambo-like warrior, hasn't been in the field since 1974. All his experience since then was in staff positions in Manila, Gen. Ramos said.    Gen. Ramos has played an instrumental role in quashing past coup attempts, but it's impossible to tell how long he will be able to retain control of the increasingly divided armed forces. While striking out at Col. Honasan, the general also expressed frustration over past leniency by President Aquino and her civilian cabinet toward leaders of the rebellions -- Col. Honasan's coup attempt was the fifth against her government in 19 months.    While Mrs. Aquino has said she won't negotiate terms with Col. Honasan, Gen. Ramos remarked dryly: &quot;The past record would indicate that the civilian leadership has been fairly flexible.&quot;    As an example, he said he wasn't permitted to even disarm, let alone punish, one group of military men after the first coup attempt in July 1986. Further, Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan, who was detained after that coup attempt, had to be released when civilian authorities wouldn't press charges, he said. Now, the general noted, Col. Cabauatan is leading a private armed group and, like Col. Honasan, issues periodic threats from hiding.    Gen. Ramos made clear that he hopes the civilian leadership will act on his recommendation to restore the death penalty for a range of crimes, including rebellion. At present, the maximum sentence a civil court could give Col. Honasan for rebellion would be 12 years in prison.    Although Col. Honasan served for years as a top aide to former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, Gen. Ramos dodged questions about a possible link between Mr. Enrile, now an opposition senator, and the coup attempt. He said only that he wouldn't discount the possibility of Col. Honasan's &quot;connecting to or being connected by political opponents&quot; of the government. He also said that Mr. Enrile couldn't have been blind to Col. Honasan's buildup of cache and weaponry, which he said occurred under the umbrella of the Defense Ministry, he added. Military investigators are trying to determine how much money and material was diverted to the stockpile.    Gen. Ramos said Col. Honasan was an example of the lack of discipline among young military officers who were &quot;exploited, co-opted, somehow misused by civilian political leaders&quot; under President Marcos. They were exposed to &quot;privileges, perks, extra pay and allowances and were the ones most vulnerable to the bypassing of the regular chain of command,&quot; he said. For example, he noted that Col. Honasan, while serving in the Defense Ministry, also was president of Beatriz Marketing andamp; Trading Corp., a unit of a group of companies taken over by the military during the Marcos regime.    Gen. Ramos said that the U.S. has been &quot;very supportive&quot; since the coup attempt but added that he has information that unofficial Americans may have contributed to the destabilization of the government. He rated his information as more reliable than similar statements that have appeared in local newspapers.    Some newspapers had claimed that a Caucasian was with Col. Honasan inside military headquarters during the coup. </TEXT></DOC>
