in retrospect, Motorola fritteredaway its lead by doing the 68030 instead of pressing ahead with the 68040.andM;- o -andM;Racal Electronics Plc values its subcontract from the Dowty-SemaandM;Ltd consortium for command and control systems for the Royal Navy's Type 23frigates at #42m (CI No 1,239).andM;- o -andM;Lionel Singer Corp Pty Ltd of Sydney is a very popular AustralianandM;representative for young American companies because it flatters each of themby setting up a subsidiary bearing their name, so that Pyramid TechnologyAustralia, founded in 1984 (CI No 10) is actually wholly-owned by LionelSinger - he spotted Sun Microsystems in 1984 too, setting up Sun Computers ofAustralia on Sun's behalf: now Pyramid Technology Corp wants to take its fateDown Under into its own hands, and has reached agreement in principle withLionel Singer Australia, to assume responsibility for business operations andto acquire some of the assets of Pyramid Technology Australia, which will beorganised as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pyramid Technology Corp; nofinancial details of the pact were disclosed.andM;- o -andM;The Scorpion Semiconductor division of Scorpion Technologies Inc,andM;San Jose has bought the proprietary rights to P-Channel silicon gate metaloxide semiconductor technology from Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Sunnyvale:the agreement provides for the transfer to Scorpion of AMD's full line ofP-Channel FIFO and shift register memory devices, including masks, processtechnology and existing inventories; as well as the semiconductor arm,Scorpion Technologies has units doing add-in processor boards for micros andraster-to-vector conversion software for computer-aided design.andM;- o -andM;Aldus Corp has introduced release 2.0 of its Persuasion desktopandM;presentations program for the Apple Computer Inc Macintosh: the companyreminds us that Persuasion is a complete desktop presentations toolkit foroutlining, word processing, drawing, charting and formatting presentations,and that it can produce output for black-and-white or colour overheads and35mm slides, as well as speaker notes and audience handouts, but fails to saywhat new features are offered in the new release; the thing is $500, $75 toPersuasion 1.0 users.andM;- o -andM;Fujitsu Ltd's efforts to establish a world standard forandM;integrated circuit memory cards - credit-card-sized add-in memory modules forportable computers and similar products (CI No 1,219) has met a readyresponse in Japan, where Hitachi Maxell Ltd, Matsushita Electric IndustrialCo, Seiko Epson Corp, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu have agreed to adhere to thememory card Version 3 guidelines set by the Japan Electronic IndustryDevelopment Association; the body is also asking that different companiesmake their word processors and personal computers compatible with thesuggested standard for the cards.andM;- o -andM;Intelligent Business Systems Inc, Milford, Connecticut has joinedandM;forces with Oracle Corp to market Oracle with the EasyTalk knowledge-basedinformation retrieval system: EasyTalk combines a natural language processorand a database expert system designed to enable direct end-user access to&quot;the complex relational database structures that form most real-worldapplications&quot;.andM;- o -andM;M/A-Com Inc, the former Microwave Associates, has definitiveandM;agreement to sell its government systems division for about $70m to a groupof current and former managers of the division: the business accounted forabout $64m, 15%, of M/A-Com's $424.2m fiscal 1988 turnover.andM;- o -andM;Correction: Harris Corp's PABX business is not included in theandM;operations that the Melbourne, Florida firm plans to sell (CI No 1,239).andM;- o -andM;Remember all the hassle IBM gave the latest company to show upandM;brandishing IBM's nickname, tiny Northport, New York-based Big Blue ProductsInc? IBM wrote to the company asserting that &quot;Big Blue is a trade mark of theIBM Corporation&quot; - only trouble is, it ain't: turns out that whilefabricating 4M-bit memories on thumbnail-sized slivers of silicon is a breezefor IBM, and the company is no slouch at building some of the most powerfulmainframes in the world, the Armonkeys are all fingers and thumbs when itcomes to more mundane matters like filling in a trade mark application formfor the US Patent andamp; Trademark Office, and because it forgot to date its firstattempt, and forgot to sign the second one, that Big Blue trademark is still pending.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
