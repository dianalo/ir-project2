(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The shooting death of a couple a fewfeet from their adoptive baby's crib has meant a second chance forthe 18-year-old biological mother, who said Wednesday she is readynow to raise the child.   Tracy Medeiros successfully fought to regain custody of Travis,the son she gave up at birth nine months ago.   As she prepared him for a trip home to Massachusetts, she metWednesday with social service workers, attended a parenting classhere and talked with a child psychologist.   ``Now I know I'm ready. I've grown up a lot,'' said Medeiros.   ``She's a gutsy little kid. She's young and that's the big thingagainst her,'' said her attorney, Barbara Rohan. ``She's determinedto do it. She's really determined.''   Pregnant at 17, Medeiros decided to give up the baby after herboyfriend left her. A former boyfriend introduced Medeiros to hiscousin Tasia Stephens and her husband, William, of Novato.   Married for 15 years and owners of successful hair salons andvideo stores, Tasia, 43, and William, 45, wanted desperately toadopt a baby.   The young mother-to-be and the Stephenses grew close. Medeirosstayed at a home for teen-age mothers in nearby Santa Rosa duringher pregnancy. She and the couple chose the baby's name together andthe couple was present at his birth.   The Stephenses paid her medical and travel expenses, and kept thebaby even though the formal adoption process was delayed by abacklog of cases. Medeiros planned to visit the baby and theStephenses during the yearend holidays.   Then Novato police called her in Massachusetts to say theStephenses had been found shot to death in their bed Dec. 14.Travis, hungry but unharmed, was found in his crib, where he hadbeen unattended for at least 24 hours, authorities estimated.   Suddenly, Medeiros said, the safe, secure future she arranged forher son was uncertain.   ``My world was totally crushed,'' she said. ``I thought, `What amI going to do with the baby?' I thought, `I love him, I want him tobe with me.'''   A Marin County judge placed the baby in a foster home, andMedeiros petitioned for custody. Relatives of the Stephenses arguedthat returning Travis to his biological mother wasn't in his bestinterest.   On Tuesday, Superior Court Juvenile Commissioner Sylvia Shapiroruled the adoption wasn't final and Medeiros was still the baby'slegal parent. The custody agreement requires Medeiros to takeparenting classes and make monthly reports about the child's welfareso the case can be reviewed in six months.   As Medeiros prepared for the trip home, the Stephenses'housekeeper and her boyfriend, Yolanda Segura and Zohelin Diaz, both25-year-old Guatamalans, were arraigned on charges of murder. Policesaid they know of no motives.   Rohan said experts believe Travis was old enough at the time ofthe slayings ``to be real affected by what happened to him,'' someetings with a child psychologist can help Medeiros detect signs ofemotional problems.   Medeiros lives with her mother in Bellerica, Mass., and works ata state institution for the retarded. She has arranged full-timechild care so she can continue working.   ``At the time of the adoption, I was doing what I thought wasbest for him. Now I'm doing what's best for him again,'' Medeirossaid, adding that she was so scared during the hearing that shedidn't speak.   ``I never really wanted to give him up in the first place,'' shesaid.   Rohan said Medeiros at first was frightened by the new situation,by the prospect of failure and by media attention, but the lawyersaid she detected a growing closeness between mother and child.   ``He's a sweet, friendly little baby. He really is. He'sobviously been very loved,'' Rohan said. ``I think he's starting toget to know her.''   Sebastopol attorney Allison Pharis, who handled the adoption,said Medeiros will ``be your basic hard-working, single mothertrying to make it.'' The Stephenses' relatives now want an amicablerelationship with her, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
