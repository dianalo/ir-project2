Enduringanimosities and opposing interests remain. Thus the cause of peacemust be served by an America strong enough _ and sure enough _ todefend our interests and ideals. It's this American idea that forthe past four decades helped inspire the Revolution of '89.   Here at home _ and in the world _ there is history in the making_ and history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season ofchange, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk Shipyard in Poland atthe monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity. It's a monumentof simple majesty. Three tall crosses rise up from the stones. Atopeach cross, an anchor _ an ancient symbol of hope.   The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady intimes of change _ a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom isat the very heart of the idea that is America.   Giving life to the idea depends on every one of us. Our anchorhas always been faith and family.   In the last few days of this past momentous year, our family wasblessed once more _ celebrating the joy of life when a little boybecame our 12th grandchild.   When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles athome and abroad seemed manageable _ in perspective.   Now, I know what you're thinking: That's a grandfather talking.   Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children thispast year _ across this country, and everywhere from the Far Eastto Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike.The budding young environmentalists I met this month, who joined meexploring the Florida Everglades. The little leaguers I playedcatch with in Poland _ ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series.Even the kids who are ill or alone _ God bless those boarderbabies, born addicted to drugs _ coping with problems no childshould have to face. But, you know, when it comes to hope and thefuture: Every kid is the same. Full of dreams. Ready to take on theworld. All special because they are the very future of freedom. Tothem belongs this new world I've been speaking about.   So tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Letme start with my generation _ the grandparents out there. You areour living link to the past. Tell your grandchildren the story ofstruggles waged, at home and abroad. Of sacrifices freely made forfreedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well _ becauseevery American has a story to tell.   Parents: Your children look to you for direction and guidance.Tell them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation underGod. Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive,liberty is their most precious legacy. And of all the gifts thencan give, the greatest is helping others.   And to the children and young people out there tonight: With yourests our hope _ all that America will mean in the years anddecades ahead. Fix your vision on a new century _ your century. Ondreams we cannot see. On the destiny that is yours _ and yoursalone.   And finally, let all Americans _ all of us together here in thischamber, the symbolic center of democracy _ affirm our allegianceto this idea we call America. And let us all remember that theState of the Union depends on each and every one of us.</TEXT><HEAD>END BUSH TEXT _ 7 TAKES</HEAD></DOC>
