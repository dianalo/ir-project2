Coal sales and prices in export markets, especially inJapan and Europe, are likely to increase if oil pricescontinue to climb sharply. U.S. coal prices would then inchup slowly, but only if world crude oil prices were to remainhigh.</LP><TEXT>   The possibility of a return to good times follows a roughdecade in which an oversupply of coal led to depressedprices, massive layoffs and mine closings throughout thecoalfields. Still, industry executives, who have had theirhopes for a coal revival dashed before, remain cautious.&quot;Those of us who've been around want to see what's real andsustainable,&quot; says Gene Samples, president and chiefexecutive officer of Arch Mineral Corp. in St. Louis.   Despite the caution, industry leaders are assessing howfast they could increase production if spot market coalprices climb or international orders increase further.   Westmoreland Coal Co., Philadelphia, says it could boostproduction to about 13 million tons from its current 10.8million tons a year, if demand from the spot market picks up,says E.B. Leisenring Jr., Westmoreland's chairman. &quot;We coulddo that with very little capital investment,&quot; he notes.Instead, extra shifts would be added at its Virginia and WestVirginia mines.   No decision has been made because the company, likeothers, is waiting to see what happens in the Middle East.&quot;If profitability appears on the horizon, and it looks likeit will stay, people are very sanguine about going ahead,&quot; hesays. &quot;We'll see people in the coal business encouraged tospend capital for a change.&quot;   Producers' spending plans depend on what buyers do in themarket. A green light would be if buyers choose the stabilityof long-term contracts over purchases from the spot market,the first place where a price jump would occur. Prices varybased on the type of coal and other factors, but spot pricesfor a ton of low-sulfur coal are about $24 to $27. Long-termcontract prices are $25 to $28.   &quot;There's going to be an impact,&quot; says Richard L. Lawson,president of the National Coal Association, an industry tradegroup. Export prices, for instance, will climb about $3 a tonin the months ahead, he predicts.   &quot;Japan and Europe can switch between oil and coal, so theexport markets are likely to tighten up,&quot; says Daniel Roling,energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Exporters --such as Westmoreland, Pittston Co., Ashland Coal Inc. andothers -- would be the first to benefit from the oil shock.   U.S. export sales had been expected to rise in comingmonths, regardless of the oil crisis, because governmentsubsidies on mines in Germany and elsewhere are expected tobe reduced, making U.S. coal more competitive with coal fromEurope and elsewhere.   In the U.S., prices don't fluctuate as quickly, becausecoal and oil don't compete that much. About 75% of the onebillion tons of coal produced this year in the U.S. will bepurchased by U.S. power plants. Oil is used to produce onlyabout 5% of the nation's electricity, while coal accounts forabout 55%. Nuclear power and natural gas make up the rest.   Many U.S. utilities don't have the ability to switchbetween fuels. Those that can switch only &quot;will change wheneconomics get strong enough,&quot; Mr. Leisenring says. No oneagrees on what the price of oil would have to be to make coalmore attractive.   If demand does pick up, the coal industry is in a lotbetter shape than it was during previous oil shocks.Production has soared from 440 million tons in 1973, Mr.Lawson said. Productivity has increased at about 6% a year,as more mines have been mechanized and fewer miners areneeded to dig coal. There also are fewer and more powerfulplayers in the industry that are less likely to rush withexpansion plans unless there's proof demand is sustainable.   After the oil shocks of the 1970s, oil companies andothers rushed in and bought up vast coal reserves as a hedge.With more players in the market, coal production increased inthe early 1980s, without any spike in demand, depressingprices. &quot;That's less likely to happen this time,&quot; Mr. Samplesays, because fewer companies will rush to expand. Currently,less than 20% of the production comes from independent coalcompanies, while the rest comes from mines owned by oil, gas,chemical and other companies.   Another result of the oil crisis could be a slowdown inpassage of a tougher Clean Air Act, which is pending inCongress. The legislation would limit emissions fromcoal-fired power plants and make coal more expensive forutilities.   In recent meetings at the White House, Mr. Lawson said hehas cautioned officials that those environmental policies,along with possible energy taxes and the prospect ofincreased oil prices, could be too much at once. &quot;It wouldtie a pretty big tag around the energy industry,&quot; he says.&quot;I'm not sure the economy can swallow that right now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
