ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Under the handy but artificial deadline of 100days, President Bush is receiving the first report card of hispresidency before any real test of his ability to handle the job.   The early assessments offer neither rave reviews nor harshcriticism. Bush wins praise for his outstretched, bipartisan handand his open style, but catches grief for what he might call ``thevision thing,'' his failure to articulate any direction other thanan intention to pursue a moderate version of Reaganism.   Even Mikhail S. Gorbachev has expressed impatience with how longit is taking the new administration to complete its foreign policyreview.   Perhaps the most difficult ordeal of the Bush administration'sfirst months was the fight over his nomination of former Texas Sen.John Tower to be secretary of defense.   The Senate rejected the nomination after a long, partisanbloodletting, an event sure to leave scars. But despite widespreadexpectations that it signalled Congress' intent to challenge thenew president for dominance, the bitter fight has largely fadedfrom memory.   In fact, Bush's willingness to work with theDemocratic-controlled Congress has led to compromises on the budgetand Contra aid, issues on which the Reagan administration nevercame close to agreement with the Democrats.   ``I think he's done a pretty good job,'' said Senate MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine. Mitchell said benchmarks like100-day assessments were ``completely arbitrary ... simply acreation of others.''   While there is no magic to the 100-day mark, Bush himself walkedinto that trap. The day after his landslide victory, he said, ``Wewill now have 70-whatever days it is to formulate a game plan, afirst 100 days priorities, if you will, and they'll be specific,and I will do my level best to fulfill my commitments to theAmerican people.''   No such specific game plan emerged, either during the transitionor in his inaugural address, which was more an exercise in settinga stylistic tone than spelling out an agenda.   ``A good start,'' was the president's own low-key assessment ofhis first three months in office.   He cited bipartisan agreements with Congress on the budget andContra aid and his plan to stabilize the troubled savings and loanindustry.   Presidential scholar James David Barber of Duke University wasless generous: ``I think his grade is incomplete. We still have yetto see what he's going to do if anything.''   But the ultimate tests of presidents are events that adhere tono timetables.   Let the economy turn sour, the stock market drop or interestrates, inflation or unemployment jump; or let America's imageabroad be shaken by a terrorist act or other foreign policy crisisand the public will take its measure of the president'sphilosophical bearings and leadership ability.   Bush has not yet faced a major crisis. His predecessors, RonaldReagan and Jimmy Carter, are remembered far differently for theirability to deal with hard times.   Few presidents could match Reagan's skill dealing withadversity, whether it was the prolonged recession that marked hisfirst two years in the White House or the deaths of 241 Americanservicemen in 1983, when a terrorist bomb destroyed a U.S. Marinebarracks in Lebanon.   Few presidents showed less talent for dealing with adversitythan Carter, who was unable to deflect public unease over aneconomy battered by OPEC and the frustration that built during theIranian hostage crisis.   At the hundred-day mark of their administrations, Reagan andCarter either couldn't predict or didn't recognize the events onwhich their terms would be judged.   Carter began with the image of a president with a distinctivestyle who knew where he wanted to go. He gave a positive assessmentof his first 100 days, citing his energy program, nuclear armsreduction proposals and emphasis on human rights.   Four years later, Reagan was firmly in charge and lookingcertain to win congressional approval of his tax and budget cuttingproposals. He weathered an assassination attempt and gave a cleardemonstration of the style and wit that would serve him so wellthroughout his presidency.   While Reagan was president, he clearly was the dominant figurein Washington.   Is Bush somehow less a commanding figure than his predecessor?   ``For six of his eight years, Reagan had a Republican Senate,''said Mitchell. ``I think there was a marked difference betweenReagan's first six years and his last two (when the Democrats wereback in control of the Senate). ... I think the fairer test isBush's first months against Reagan's last two years and there, Ithink the difference is not so great.''   The Maine Democrat called Bush's effort to reach out to Congress``a marked improvement over the Reagan years.'' He cited theagreement on Contra aid, which he said was ``an initiative of hisadministration.''   But Bush didn't escape free of criticism. Mitchell said therewas ``a complete failure of leadership on the Alaska oil spill,''and he criticized Bush's stands on legislation to increase theminimum wage and to intervene in the Eastern Air Lines strike.   ``Both he and we recognize there will be differences,'' saidMitchell.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Donald M.
