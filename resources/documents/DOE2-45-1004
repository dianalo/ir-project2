A critical soaking temperature exists above which carbonremoval causes staining. This was determined as about 775/sup 0/C fora shale brick sample. Firing trials on shale brick with soaking at thistemperature established that an increase in oxygen level reduces thetime required for total removal of carbon. As the partial pressure ofoxygen increases though, the effect levels out. Although oxygen injectionis a viable solution to the problem of carbon removal, the ease and rateof burnout in a given sample can be significantly affected by small variationsin conditions of clay preparation.
