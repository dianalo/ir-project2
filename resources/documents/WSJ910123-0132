Other regional Bellcompanies fell in sympathy, with Southwestern Bell Corp. down$2.625 to $52.625 and U S West Inc. down $1 to $37, also inBig Board composite trading.   Bell Atlantic reported fourth-period net income rose to$236 million, or 65 cents a share, from $57.9 million, or 15cents a share a year ago. The 1990 quarter included a chargeof $60 million, or 15 cents a share, to reflect declines inthe market value of its financial services business. In the1989 quarter, profit was reduced by $241.2 million, or 61cents a share, reflecting programs to reduce managementranks, consolidation of network services facilities, assetwrite-downs and early retirement of debentures.   Without the adjustments, earnings for thePhiladelphia-based Baby Bell would have been $296 million, or80 cents a share, about even with the $299.1 million, or 76cents a share, reported a year ago.   Revenue for the quarter rose 7.5% to $3.11 billion from$2.89 billion the year before. The company said that revenuewas affected by a downturn in demand because of the softeconomy. The company reported lower growth in access linesand toll volumes and lower cellular usage per customer.Raymond Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said theslower growth was partly offset by the company's &quot;success ingenerating new revenues in our telephone companies and byrigorous expense controls.&quot;   For the year, Bell Atlantic's earnings rose 22% to $1.31billion, or $3.38 a share, from $1.07 billion, or $2.71 ashare. Excluding the one-time adjustments, however, earningsrose only 4% to $1.37 billion, or $3.53 a share, from $1.32billion, or $3.33 a share. For the year, revenue climbed 7.4%to $12.30 billion from $11.45 billion.   The company's base of cellular customers continued to growsharply, expanding 37% in the past year to more than 257,000,in part reflecting an aggressive Christmas promotion. Newercellular customers, however, tend to use their phones lessfrequently than long-time customers.   Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, reportedfourth-quarter net income dropped 39% to $196 million, or 50cents a share, from $322 million, or 79 cents a share, theyear before. The latest quarter included reserves of $71.5million, most of which -- $60 million -- was set aside forlosses expected from selling its real estate holdings.Revenue for the period slipped to $2.44 billion from $2.48billion.   Earnings for the 1989 period were boosted by adjustmentsof $36.4 million, or nine cents a share. Excluding thereserves and adjustments, 1990 fourth-quarter earnings wouldhave dropped about 6% to $268 million, or 68 cents a share.   For the year, net dropped 17% to $1.03 billion, or $2.58 ashare, from $1.24 billion, or $3.02 a share, the year before.Excluding the reserves, earnings declined 11% to $1.10billion, or $2.76 a share. Revenue inched up to $9.72 billionfrom $9.59 billion.   Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer, said theyear was &quot;one of transition.&quot; During 1990, the company mademajor investments in its networks as well as investments incable and personal communications networks in the U.K. andcellular phone service in Germany. Further, its Pacific Bellunit absorbed a $391 million rate cut that Californiaregulators required as part of a switch to anincentive-regulation system. The cut was partly offset by $72million in lower settlement payments. Mr. Ginn said that &quot;weexpect increased earnings from incentive regulation, wirelessand new businesses over time.&quot;   Bell Atlantic's customer telephone lines rose a modest2.5% to 17,484,000 from 17,056,000, while Pacific Telesis'sgrew 3.3% to 14,100,000 from 13,650,000. Daniel Reingold, atelecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., saidthat access line growth has slowed over the past severalquarters, &quot;but in this quarter we've seen even more of it.The fact is that in this recession, access line growth isslowing more than in past recessions&quot; and occurring earlierin the downturn.</TEXT></DOC>
