Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters theguerrillas had been ``shooting their way into and invading certainprivate homes'' in San Salvador, the capital.   ``They briefly overran the home of a U.S. embassy officer butwere driven out by the Salvadoran armed forces,'' he toldreporters, also saying:   ``It is our belief that all United States personnel and theirfamilies are safe but several are in their homes in this area ofheavy fighting.''   The guerillas burned a mansion blocks away from the officialresidence of U.S. Ambassador William Walker.   The early morning attacks were in the affluent Escalonneighborhood, where the rebels last week took over a SheratonHotel, entrapping six U.S. Green Berets during a 27-hour standoffwith government forces.   It was not immediately clear if today's fighting signaled theresumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that beganNov. 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew Nov. 22.   Residents of the affluent Escalon neighborhood said they heardseveral loud explosions near the fortified complex between 2 a.m.and 3 a.m.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater first announced theattacks, saying he had little information, as he was beingquestioned about reported harsh tactics in a crackdown by therightist government of U.S.-backed President Alfredo Cristiani.   Asked about the raids by Cristiani's government on church andlabor offices, the arrests of civilians and other tactics of thecounteroffensive crackdown, Fitzwater said, ``Our response is thatwe deplore violence and killing on both sides.''   Pressed as to whether the administration had communicated anyconcerns to the Cristiani government, he said, ``We have made ourviews known to both sides publicly and privately that we areopposed to the killing and the violence there.''   President Bush has repeatedly voiced strong support forCristiani in the war against the Marxist rebels.   For his part, Baker told reporters that, with regard to reportsof right-wing death squad activity, ``I think its important thatthey do everything they can to get control of that kind ofactivity.''   Fitzwater appeared to take a softer approach today to the arrestof Connecticut church worker, Jennifer J. Casolo, by the Salvadoranpolice than on Monday when he had said ``there are indications''that she was involved with a cache of weapons found buried in thebackyard of her residence in San Salvador.   He said she would be charged with illegal explosives and weapons.   When the police arrived at her house on Sunday, she telephonedthe U.S. consul general, Fitzwater said. A consular officer wentimmediately to her home and stayed with her during her arrest andthrough that night.   Fitzwater said that during her four years in El Salvador, MissCasolo had become ``known to embassy ofifcials thorugh her workwith Christian education sminars and coordinating non ofifcialdelgations to El Salvador.   ``We have been monitoring her case closely to assure she is welltreated. ... The embassy will continue to assure that she is givenevery benefit due her under Salvadoran law.''</TEXT></DOC>
