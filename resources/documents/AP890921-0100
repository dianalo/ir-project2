As the storm bore down on South Carolina and Georgia, the CoastGuard in Charleston, S.C., shut down the Intracoastal Waterway andnearby rivers to commercial vessels and advised private boaters tostay put or move upstream.   ``We've given out warnings over the radios and televisions sayingplease do not sail at this time due to the hurricane,'' said seamanapprentice Iain Wells, who said rescuers would venture out only iflives were endangered.   ``If there is a boat that's just drifting, basically forget it.We're not going to send someone out there to get it.''   Coast Guard C-130 cargo planes capable of carrying up to 20 tonsof supplies were the first relief flights Tuesday to reach PuertoRico after Hugo struck. And in an extraordinary move, an armed CoastGuard contingent went ashore Thursday in St. Croix after law andorder collapsed.   ``We were the maritime agency that was in the area,'' O'Dell saidThursday. ``We have maritime and peacetime missions, but we're stilla military service and we still have to maintain our militaryreadiness.''   Six cutters remained in the area Thursday to evacuate anyone whowanted off St. Croix while others stood by to help as needed as Hugochurned toward the U.S. coast.   The modern Coast Guard is part of the Department ofTransportation, but its history of law enforcement dates to 1867when its predecessor, the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service, was the onlypolice agency for the Alaska territory.   The Coast Guard has seen active duty as part of the Navy in WorldWar I, World War II and the Vietnam War, often escorting convoys andoperating landing crafts.   Although the Coast Guard is probably best known for its searchand rescue efforts in modern times, it is deeply involved in thedrug war. Its cutters have fired on 18 vessels as part of its druginterception duties.   ``You have to be prepared to be ready to use and deploy the shipin any kind of operation,'' O'Dell said. ``The cutters are equippedwith the necessary armaments to carry out their mission.''   Both the South Carolina and Caribbean Coast Guard units are partof the 7th Coast Guard District based in Miami.   ``There's quite a bit of tug of war going on in the 7th rightnow. She's getting pulled from about six different directions,''O'Dell said. ``If need be, we will have resources moving in fromCape Cod or California.''</TEXT></DOC>
