In order to perform planning studies on the development ofdistribution networks, ENEL is working on a computation system, whichutilizes the information stored in the data base, and aims: to provideenergy consumptions forecasts for each area of the country; to transferconsumptions from each area to the distribution network nodes and toevaluate the electric demand using a statistical power/energy correlationmodel; to analyze several development alternatives of the network (newMV/LV transformers, new MV branches, new HV/MV substations) and to selectthe optimum development plan comparing the overall costs (investments,operation, risk). The system consists of a set of integrated programsthat, in order to make easier its utilization by field engineers, willbe operated with interactive and graphic procedures, made available bythe use of graphic work stations. The report describes the main objectiveand the basic hypothesis assumed to prepare the computation system andits general architecture.</TEXT></DOC>
