Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for Africanaffairs, told reporters after arriving that he has ``a long agendaof issues'' he is prepared to discuss ``in a frank and fairmanner.''   He is to spend two days in this strategic but impoverishednation that is the Soviet Union's staunchest ally on the continent.   That friendship with Moscow soured once-warm relations betweenWashington and Addis Ababa after President Mengistu Haile MariamMengistu and a clique of fellow military officers ousted theEmperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and the Soviet Union becameEthiopia's biggest patron in 1977.   Cohen was expected to meet Foreign Minister Berhanu Bayih thisafternoon and Mengistu on Saturday before leaving Sunday for Sudan.   He said that besides Ethiopia's civil war and regional conflictshe plans to discuss economic issues and the return of refugees inthe region.   He also was expected to discuss money the United States saysEthiopia still owes from weapons it purchased years ago.Discussions on economic growth will be handicapped by U.S. lawsthat deny development aid to countries that owe money for arms andare accused of human rights abuses.   Cohen's visit comes a day after Amnesty International publisheda report charging that Ethiopia is among the worst offenders inAfrica in failing to ratify international human rights covenants.   The London-based organization's report said thousands ofsuspected political opponents in Ethiopia are imprisoned for monthsor even years without trial and that many are tortured. Othersvanish without explanation, it said.   Cohen's concern for refugees involves hundreds of thousands whohave fled wars in neighboring Sudan and Somalia and are living inrefugee camps in Ethiopia, while large numbers of Ethiopians havefled to Sudan to escape their country's northern civil war.   Ethiopian refugees also remain in Somalia, where they fled adecade ago after Ethiopian troops backed by Soviets and Cubansrepulsed a Somali invasion.   The American official's visit comes after several appeals fromMengistu for improved relations.   After he seized power, Mengistu's government threw out the U.S.Military Assistance Group and closed the American government'sinformation service. Washington retaliated by suspending itstechnical assistance program, then the largest in Africa.   The United States and Ethiopia also withdrew their ambassadors,leaving charge d'affaires to head their embassies.   There was little contact until the 1984-85 famine, when theUnited States was the biggest donor of emergency food.   Cohen initially was to visit Ethiopia at the end of May but thattrip was postponed by an attempted coup in Addis Ababa.   He arrived from Egypt where he met with President Hosni Mubarakand reportedly discussed the civil wars in Ethiopia and Sudan.Guerrillas in northern Eritrea want independence from Ethiopiawhile southern Sudanese want more autonomy. All the rebels belongto ethnic minorities.   The U.S. Embassy said Cohen is the first U.S. official to visitEthiopia in the 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
