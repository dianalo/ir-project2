Macy andamp; Co. has put Myron Ullman III, its45-year-old vice chairman, on the inside track to succeedEdward Finkelstein, its chairman and chief executive officer.   The decision by Macy, which filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy protection Jan. 27, appears to have been promptedby another company's attempt to hire away Mr. Ullman. It alsocomes amid signs that some investors in Macy are questioningwhether Mr. Finkelstein, 66, should step down.</LP><TEXT>   In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Finkelstein statedemphatically that he is committed to staying with Macy andthat he intends to continue in those positions at least untilthe retailer exits from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. &quot;Ifeel energetic and involved,&quot; said Mr. Finkelstein. &quot;I have aresponsibility to take this company out of Chapter 11.&quot;   In federal bankruptcy court documents filed recently inlower Manhattan, Macy disclosed that Mr. Ullman received an&quot;attractive and lucrative {job} offer&quot; from another companybefore the bankruptcy filing. Mr. Ullman would have becomethe second senior executive in that company, which wasn'tidentified, and would have received a major pay increase.   Seeking to retain Mr. Ullman, the court papers show,Macy's board granted him a new employment contract the day ofthe bankruptcy filing. The contract entitles Mr. Ullman toseverance payments of at least $2.4 million if he isn'tpromoted after Mr. Finkelstein steps down. Last night, Mr.Finkelstein said the contract was &quot;a response to a legitimateoffer&quot; and that Macy &quot;wanted Mr. Ullman in place.&quot;   Mr. Finkelstein added that the contract was designed onlyto give Mr. Ullman &quot;financial security,&quot; and that &quot;nosuccessor has been named or implied.&quot; He added that otherexecutives will also be accorded financial security shortlyas in other bankruptcies.   The new contract, however, also named Mr. Ullman chiefoperating officer, Macy's traditional No. 2 post. Formerly,Macy President Mark Handler had been chief operating officer.Mr. Handler retains the president's title and gains the titleof chief merchandising officer.   Within the last week, succession issues at Macyintensified at a board meeting. At that meeting, according towitnesses, director Laurence Tisch told Mr. Finkelstein thatMacy bondholders-upset at their losses on the company'ssecurities -- felt it was time for a change in the company'stop management.   Mr. Tisch, chairman of Loews Corp., which owns 17% ofMacy's stock, didn't personally pressure Mr. Finkelstein tostep down, a witness said. Rather, Mr. Tisch and his oldestson, James, said they were merely relaying bondholders'concerns.   Regardless of how the Tisches couched their concerns, theytouched off a spirited reaction from Mr. Finkelstein.According to witnesses, Mr. Finkelstein responded with anextended recap of his contributions to Macy over the past twodecades, going back to the days when he ran Macy's West Coastoperations.   Mr. Finkelstein gave no indication at the meeting that hewas interested in stepping down. And Macy bondholders so farhaven't presented any unified challenge to Mr. Finkelstein'scontinued tenure at the retailer.   Commenting last night on that meeting, Mr. Finkelsteinsaid: &quot;There was never any indication of anything butcomplete support for management, and the fact thatbondholders are cranky is known by management and the publicat large. You couldn't have a stronger supporter than LarryTisch.&quot;   Mr. Ullman joined Macy in 1988 as executive vice presidentand was promoted to vice chairman in August 1992.   In addition to his new title, Mr. Ullman was given a basesalary of $800,000 a year, with a promise of 10% annualincreases for three years. More significantly, the agreementspecifies that if Mr. Finkelstein &quot;ceases for any reason&quot; tobe chief executive officer of Macy, Mr. Ullman will receive anew executive position that &quot;represents an increase instatus, duties and authority,&quot; within 60 days.   If Mr. Ullman doesn't receive the new post, he willreceive from Macy an amount equal to three times his currentsalary.</TEXT></DOC>
