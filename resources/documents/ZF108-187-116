 In fact, there hasbeen an interesting split in their application to newspaper needs.andP;  The IBMPC and compatibles have been used for text handling and as file servers,whereas the Apple Macintosh has been used for graphics and for area and pageassembly tasks such as display ad makeup and interactive pagination.andM;This split is evident in the new systems on the market.andP;  Most editorial andclassified systems sold today are built around PCs, supplied by such vendorsas CText, Dewar, GB Techniques, Miles 33 (formerly Pagitek) and Monigraaf.andO;But the Macintosh is commonly used for creation of display ads, with DigitalTechnology, Mycro-Tek, Multi-Ad Services and Concept Publishing producingquite successful software.andP;  There are exceptions to this rule, namely thePC-based display ad systems from Archetype, Cybervision, Dewar and Serif, andthe Macintosh-based editorial systems (but not classified) from DigitalTechnology, QED and Talbot.andP;  But these are the exceptions rather than therule.andM;The Macintosh started to be used in an editorial environment much later thanthe PC, and there are few cases where major systems using Macintoshtechnology for editorial work have been installed.andM;To our knowledge, the first daily newspaper to develop and install Mac-basededitorial systems was the UK's Talbot Publishing Systems, which we believewas also the first newspaper in the world to build a system using theAppleShare file server and networking software.andP;  We have watched this smallcompany's developments since late in 1985, when it was selling portableeditorial terminals and communications software.andM;At that time, it was involved in a number of interesting installations,particularly as the main supplier to Eddy Shah in his Messenger Group andPost operations.andP;  In these cases, as we outlined in Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  3, itbuilt excellent, innovative functional systems.andP;  We should inject a commenthere that the innovation and strong functionality were more in the areas offile management and pagination than in composition, which remains horriblyweak, lacking some key functions that are now taken for granted among evenlowly desktop publishing systems.andP;  We'll elaborate on composition later.andM;With that caveat, we'll add that, at the recent IFRA show see Vol.andP;  19, No.andO;5), Talbot attracted a great deal of attention with its multiuser paginationsystem.andM;Following the show, it reached an agreement to supply what could probably bethe largest pagination installation in any newspaper worldwide, forlayout-driven pagination to be used by The Financial Times in London, linkedinto its System Integrators editorial system.andP;  The planned size of thissystem is between 50 and 70 pagination terminals.andM;Because of all of these developments, we decided that this was an appropriatetime to take an in-depth look at Talbot to see how its Macintosh-basedsolutions compare with the more traditional PC-based, &quot;fourth-wave&quot; editorialsystems.andP;  We also wanted to examine more closely its approaches topagination, particularly the layout-driven approach that The Financial Timesmay adopt instead of SII's Interactive News Layout (INL) system.andM;Our review was conducted at Talbot's offices in Bournemouth, one of thepremier holiday resorts on the southern coast of England, and also byvisiting one of its largest users, Evening Echo (Bournemouth), as well as TheFinancial Times in London.andM;Pagination and The Financial TimesandM;Perhaps Talbot's most significant agreement is that with The Financial Times.andO;One of the most prestigious and advanced newspapers in Europe, it is a dailynewspaper with a very heavy text content, built to a somewhat modular pagestructure.andP;  In size, The Financial Times believes that it has the heaviestnightly editorial text content of any newspaper in the world, with up to 100densely covered editorial pages per night.andP;  A unique aspect of this paper isthat almost all pages in the paper have late-breaking news on them.andM;The Financial Times uses a 350-terminal SII system with some unique features.andO;First, its Tandem computer system is the only one in the world where thecomputer has been split into two separate rooms.andP;  A fire wall was constructedbetween the two rooms, with all intercommunicating cables sealed, which meansthat the paper could still be produced even if half of the Tandem computerwere in flames.andM;Because The Financial Times has so many late-breaking news pages, itsmanagement decided that it could not adopt an interactive paginationapproach; it needed a layout-driven system.andP;  To facilitate this approach, itdesigned the paper around modular structures and developed sophisticated SIISTYL routines.andP;  It has adopted a rigidly enforced grid structure usingstandard default styles for the paper, based upon 9-point depth units.andP;  AUelements of the page, text, ads and pictures are defined in these grid units.andM;The total paper is already being largely paginated using a layout-drivenapproach, but this means producing an accurate paper dummy, marking up eacharticle with x/y coordinates and calculating the areas as exact copy depths.andO;Articles are written to the depth defined in line units on the layout.andM;This approach enables output of completely paginated articles, and oftencomplete pages  currently minus illustrations), to Monotype Lasercomp andExpress imagesetters located at the paper's remote printing plant in the EastIndia Docks.andP;  The editorial site is in a new building, built just for thatpurpose, overlooking the river Thames on Southwark Bridge, just over theriver from the City of London, about six miles from the printing plant.andM;Selecting a system.andP;  In planning for an automated pagination process, TheFinancial Times decided to automate the design process.andP;  It needed to changepages rapidly as new stories broke and older stories were moved around thepage or onto other pages.andP;  As stories moved, they would need to pick up otherlayout styles appropriate for the page and part of the page they fell on.andO;Pages could be designed by any editors and subeditors who work with design-upto 70 people.andP;  The paper did not want a system that limited the number ofpeople who could work on page design.andM;The Financial Times spoke with a large number of potential suppliers inAugust 1989 and decided to conduct in-depth evaluations of InformationEngineering's PC News Layout, SII's INL and Talbot's pagination system thatwas first shown at IFRA.andP;  Late in October, it began working with Talbot toproduce a detailed specification of its requirements for a system thatconformed to its needs in grid structure, page and area defaults and rapidpage planning.andP;  So far, about 60% of this specification has been completed;however, the system can be demonstrated linked to the SII system.andM;The Talbot system also adopts many of the elements developed for theinteractive multiuser pagination system we saw for the first time at IFRA.andO;It, too, is multiuser (more than one person can work on a page at a time).andO;This is a major requirement of The Financial Times, because it often mixesnews and features on a page, particularly where it is covering a specificindustry-related subject.andP;  Features and news staff need to see what eachother is doing.andM;The system and editorial management teams are recommending the combination ofthe manual approach currently used and the Talbot package.andP;  Work on othersolutions has ceased.andP;  An implementation program will be designed once thesoftware development has been completed to provide for fine-tuning of theinterface and to ensure that all editorial needs are met.andP;  Talbot expects tohave completed work to meet the specification by this May.andM;Current status.andP;  While at The Financial Times, we had a demonstration of thesystem as it now exists.andP;  We will cover its operation later in this article.andO;In this demonstration, we made up a complete page of the newspaper.andP;  With thesoftware in its present form (60% complete), The Financial Times system staffis designing complete pages in around six minutes.andP;  We tested output speed atthe peak production time of the newspaper, about 7 p.m., and were surprisedto see all the elements of the full page, including the composed files,assembled in only 40 seconds.andP;  At that stage, the page is ready to be sent tothe remote Monotype imagesetters for output.andP;  (This compares with about twoto three minutes to assemble a page, also for output on Monotypeimagesetters, that we saw on an Atex News Layout system at the SundayCorrespondent in London).andM;The development of this layout pagination approach at The Financial Times isvery much a joint operation between Talbot and the newspaper.andP;  It reliesgreatly on the SII STYL programming carried out by the newspaper's systemstaff and on the Talbot system's speed and flexibility.andP;  It appears to be anexcellent solution for large, high-text-content newspapers, one that shouldhave great attraction for many American papers.andM;It is interesting that what we sec as the two most significant developmentsin newspaper pagination for SII systems are taking place in London at TheEvening Standard and The Financial Times.andP;  Both are driven by the ideas ofthe newspaper staff, and both make use of Macintosh computers-running DigitalTechnology software at The Evening Standard and Talbot at The FinancialTimes.andM;For Talbot, we believe that this is a highly significant development-one thatcould push this small UK company into becoming a supplier to a totallydifferent range of newspapers from what it would normally address.andM;Talbot's historyandM;Talbot is a very small company with only 12 employees.andP;  It was started in1983 by the current managing director and sole owner, Andrew Clunies-Ross.andO;Before starting Talbot, he had been selling systems as well as holding downhis main job as principal  cellist in the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.andM;Talbot started selling remote newspaper text input systems based on Epsonportable computers, linked into special communication systems for routingcopy into newspaper publishing systems.andP;  It was in this fight that we firstmet the company at Newstec in November 1985.andP;  The next time we saw Talbot wasat the first Seybold Desktop Publishing Conference in San Francisco inSeptember 1986, where Clunies-Ross outlined the Macintosh editorial system hewas installing in a small free newspaper in Poole Dorset, The AdvertiserSeries, the free newspaper publishing arm of the UK group Southern Newspapersplc.andM;In 1987, Talbot installed a number of other systems, including two of majorsignificance for its future: the one installed by Eddy Shah in his MessengerGroup, and the text input system installed at Southern Evening Echo atSouthampton, the largest newspaper in Southern Newspapers.andP;  The Shahinstallation was for a number of separate editorial systems at the variousnewspapers in the group, with a total of 96 Macintoshes.andP;  The SouthernEvening Echo installation was as a feeder system, both from the main officeand from many remote offices, into the Atex editorial system used bysubeditors (copy editors).andP;  This configuration currently comprises 13 systemsand a total of 130 Macintosh computers.andP;  Stories are automatically sent androuted into Atex queues both onsite and from branch offices using a specialNewsWrite Atex link.andM;In 1988, Talbot made its first installations into the daily newspaper market,supplying total editorial systems.andP;  It also made a number of significantsales into the UK free newspaper market.andP;  In the daily market, it supplied a50-Macintosh system to Lloyd's List, the daily newspaper of the insurance andmarine insurance markets in the UK.andM;The firm's largest and most significant sale in 1988 was to Shah's new dailynewspaper, The Post (see Vol.andP;  18, Nos.andP;  1 and 5).andP;  This was a text andgraphics pagination system running on more than 150 Macintosh units,outputting to 12 Linotronic 500s installed at remote sites.andP;  Technically thesystem worked well, although Shah's choice of Aldus PageMaker for copyeditingand page makeup was somewhat limiting, and the use of PostScript onLinotronic RIP II Postscript RIPs placed a major constraint on the system.andO;Driving typesetters remotely at printing plants without supervision alsocaused headaches.andM;The Post folded because it failed to attract a market.andP;  Talbot, however,learned from the installation much that has been incorporated in its latestsystems.andP;  The experience also made it confident that its system design andconfigurations are suited for large editorial systems.andM;Talbot's most significant sate in 1989 was an editorial system to the EveningEcho (Bournemouth), another daily newspaper in Southern Newspapers.andP;  Talbotsupplied a full editorial system to sit alongside the already installed largeAtex IAS classified advertising system.andP;  This has been the major site for thedevelopment of Talbot's pagination system, which we saw at IFRA.andM;So far, all but two of Talbot's sales have been in the UK, including foureditorial systems of more than 80 Macintosh computers.andP;  It has made one salein Austria and one to the Utrecht School of journalism in Holland.andP;  It hasthree further systems installed at schools of journalism in the UK: theNational Council for the Training of journalists, the School of journalism inCardiff, and The Thomson Foundation.andM;Talbot would like to expand its sales into both Europe and the U.S., and itwill be concentrating its attention on developing the infrastructure forselling into these markets.andP;  In this light, it made its first internationalshowings at IFRA last October and the Seybold European Publishing Conferencein December.andP;  It is planning to make its first U.S.andP;  showing at the SeyboldSeminars in Boston next month.andM;System architectureandM;Talbot's NewsWrite system is only an editorial system.andP;  It does not handleclassified or display advertising in the manner of a dedicated classifiedsystem; however, Talbot has a small classified system that is being usedpurely in a production environment by one of its customers.andP;  A new full-scaleclassified system is under development and scheduled for late 1990.andM;The company set out to make an exceptionally easy-to-use editorial systemthat requires little understanding of computers and their operation.andP;  Itsapproach is to be as simple to use as possible in all its modes, leaving areporter or editor to use the system as an editorial tool.andM;The system is designed so it cannot be used in an accepted Macintosh fashionwhen it is logged onto the network.andP;  The editorial system user does not seethe Macintosh Finder and therefore cannot get into the filing system in thenormal fashion or call other programs when logged into the network.andP;  Anyonelogging on as a reporter has access only to reporter functions and relevantfiles.andP;  A subeditor or editor is also entitled only to certain functions.andM;To run the system, it isn't necessary to know how to run a Macintosh-only howto operate the functions needed under NewsWrite.andP;  Nevertheless, the systemconforms to conventional Macintosh practices.andP;  The Clipboard and Scrapbookare used, the keyboard shortcuts largely follow the structures laid down forApple developers, and the system uses the HFS filing structure.andP;  TheMacintosh can nm standard Macintosh applications by being booted using thenormal Macintosh start-up, but then NewsWrite data can't be accessed on thenetwork.andP;  In certain cases, a user who has the correct access privileges canboot the Finder from the NewsWrite logon and use any Macintosh program.andM;The system can be set up so that a user can log directly into a specificMacintosh program (Multi-Ad Creator, for instance) from the logon box.andP;  Whensomeone using this method quits, he is returned to the logon box, not to theFinder.andP;  This technique was used at The Post, where every subeditor logged onto Aldus PageMaker.andM;Under the AppleShare fifing system, data can be saved on the file server whennot running under NewsWrite, but only in designated folders on the server.andO;Another program could be used for text editing or layout, or for graphics,with the results stored on the file server.andP;  This data could then be accessedfrom within NewsWrite to be incorporated into pages.andP;  The user could includein pages information from a spreadsheet such as Excel.andM;File servers and networking.andP;  As we stated earlier, the NewsWrite system wasto our knowledge the first system to be implemented using AppleShare for thefile server and network management.andP;  Because of AppleShare's many limitationsfor the newspaper environment, Talbot uses only a minimum of its facilitiesand has written many routines to go with it.andP;  Talbot is likely to move awaytotally from AppleShare because it has developed its own file serversoftware, which may be installed first at The Financial Times.andP;  We'll explainthe rationale for this change later in this article.andM;With AppleShare, Talbot has developed its own routines to handle accessprivileges for users, and it also handles its own file locking.andP;  It queriesAppleShare about file status during read and write operations.andP;  Theread/write routines, which are built into the NewsWrite programs, handle dualwriting of data, something AppleShare does not do.andP;  Dual writing or automaticbackup can be to two disks on the same server or to a separate server.andM;The dual writing function's operation differs from others we have seen.andP;  Theprograms Mover and Backup constantly monitor activity on a server watchingdirectories.andP;  Whenever there is an update to a directory, Backup copies theupdate to the backup disk, either on the same server or over the network.andO;Backup runs as a foreground task on AppleShare, and Mover is run from aseparate Macintosh on the network.andM;At the Evening Echo in Bournemouth, there are four Macintosh IIx fileservers, three of which are the main production servers and the fourth purelya backup server.andP;  Each server has two 140-MB disk drives, all connected viaEtherTalk.andP;  Into the three production servers run networks using PhoneNetrunning AppleTalk protocols, to which the editorial Macintosh SE and Pluscomputers are connected.andP;  These are connected to the servers by KineticsFastpaths to bridge PhoneNet into Ethernet.andP;  Also linked to the Ethernetnetwork are two further Macintosh SEs running the NewsWrite Copy Routingprogram and a Macintosh Plus running the Mover.andM;The Mover monitors the activity in the key news baskets on servers 1 and 2and copies the updates made to them onto the backup server, Server 4, whichis installed outside the computer room.andP;  The Mover also is used forequalizing the wire baskets; for instance, two baskets can be set up for HomeNews, with the first always containing the last 50 stories and with all otherstories automatically moved into Home News 2.andP;  The Copy Routers are run ontwo Macintosh SEs.andP;  The first of these works in moving data between basketson servers I and 2 in both directions, and the other does the same betweenservers 2 and 3.andP;  The Mover program can look at a server and move data fromit to any other server on the network.andM;Also linked into the main servers are the four remote editorial offices.andO;Each of these has a mini editorial system running NewsWrite for reporters.andO;In two of these offices there are eight Macintosh Plus computers, one ofwhich is a file server and one a communications server, whereas in the twoother offices there is just a Macintosh Plus.andP;  Two of these are connected viadial-up lines into three Macintosh Pluses running Talbot's DAMS (DialTextAutomatic Modem Software).andP;  Communication between these units and the remoteoffices is totally automatic.andP;  Copy received via the DAMS servers isautomatically routed into the requisite editorial copy baskets on the mainfile servers.andM;As we stated above, Talbot is developing its own file server software toreplace AppleShare.andP;  Its rationale is that AppleShare's limitations do notmake it ideal as a newspaper file server.andP;  Talbot has developed additionalsoftware to get around many of these problems, such as dual writing of data.andO;Other limitations, however, hinder the development.andM;A principal drawback of AppleShare is the server's very slow boot times whenit is switched on or restarted, particularly when it is heavily loaded.andP;  Thisprocess can often take upwards of ten minutes.andP;  With the Talbot server, ittakes no longer to boot the server than to boot a terminal.andM;With AppleShare, people must log off the network when certain tasks are to becarried out, whereas with the Talbot software, users can be put into'suspend' mode without logging them off while the server is being workedupon.andP;  In such a case, a message is sent to all users informing them of thesystem's new status.andP;  In suspend mode, it is possible to continue writing orediting.andM;Apple advises users to limit systems to 32 physical connections to the serverto avoid corruption.andP;  In addition, AppleShare has a maximum of 50 definedusers.andP;  The Talbot server will handle the same number of physical connectionsto each server, but it can work with far more than 50 users.andM;The Talbot server software takes only 53 KB, but it will be configured with 4MB for optimum performance.andP;  It will have a minimum of 3 disk drives and willwrite to any two of these at the same time.andP;  The server is faster thanAppleShare in both booting and operation, and it will automatically rebootafter a power loss.andP;  One can also install a floppy disk in the server andaddress it directly via the Chooser as a volume.andP;  This ability simplifies theinput of external text and graphic files.andM;The new Talbot server is now completed and is being tested.andP;  It should haveits first installation soon.andM;One unusual feature of the Talbot approach is the manner in which copy ismoved around the system and between the various file servers.andP;  It is similarto the backup approach in that there is a Macintosh handling copy routing.andO;Called the Copy Router, this Macintosh will monitor the servers' baskets andfolders and will move copy from one basket to another, including from serverto server.andP;  This is one way of getting around the limtations of AppleShare inthe number of users on a server.andP;  It is possible also to link systems to havevolumes held over multiple servers that are transparent to the user.andP;  TheCopy Router will continue to be used as a performance optimizer with the newTalbot server software.andM;Basket and directory operations.andP;  The directory and basket structure of theNewsWrite systems is similar to that of many other newspaper systems.andO;Specific baskets are defined for a user, and one then can access data from abasket using short, medium and long directories.andP;  Copy routing is definedfrom a standard master routing setup program that allocates default basketsfor sending copy and archiving data to each user on the system.andP;  While thesystem is built around the Apple HFS filing system, a user only has access tospecific baskets that are defined for that position and that are specifiedthrough the master routing setup program.andM;When a person logs on as a reporter, he gets whatever access powers thenewspaper has defined.andP;  These can be as limited or as broad as those of asubeditor.andP;  The options for recall are the user's own private basket, thespike (more on this later), returned stories into an incoming basket, and oldspikes.andP;  Sending options are based on the baskets that are assigned by themaster routing setup program; these would generally be a news, sports orfeature basket.andM;The spike is the copy file (black, carbon) of all stories written by areporter.andP;  When a story is sent into one of the sending baskets, it isautomatically copied to the spike.andP;  If a reporter recalls a story from thespike, it can only be opened in read-only mode.andP;  Old spikes are spikedstories more than a specified number of days old (see below).andM;The setup program defines the routing and copy management structures forevery user.andP;  For a reporter named Smith, for example, the copy would be sentto the chosen news, sport or features basket, and spiked on a specifiedserver in the reporters folder under &quot;spike Smith l' where it would be storedfor five days.andP;  After this time, the copy would be moved from 'spike Smith 1&quot;to 'spike Smith 2,' also in the reporters folder.andP;  Here it would be storedfor 21 days.andP;  After 21 days, the copy would be moved from &quot;spike Smith 2&quot; tothe &quot;archive server,&quot; where it would be archived in the reporters spikefolder under Smith.andM;Similar structures arc used for nonarchivable data, which is finally copiedinto the waste bin.andP;  The system therefore has automatically self-purgingbaskets.andP;  Archiving on a Talbot system is normally to a worm optical discdrive linked to the network.andP;  At Bournemouth, one worm disc can hold aboutthree months of archives.andP;  Data also can be archived to streamer tape or evenfloppies.andM;The archiving operation is automatic, using the archive server to which theoptical disc is connected (at Bournemouth, a Macintosh Plus) to start at aspecified time of the day, and then to repeat this operation every specifiednumber of hours.andM;Selective directories.andP;  The system's directory structure is normal,supporting a short directory showing the catchline.andP;  A medium directory showsthe catchline, cover date, author, newspapers in which the copy is to appear(optional), the page by section type, or the specific page number, whetherthere is a photo with the story, whether the story is of rush status, copydepth, and the first 64 characters of the story.andP;  The system has changedsince we used a picture (see next page) of a long directory in ourdescription of the system in 1987.andP;  At that time, this was the longdirectory.andP;  There is now a more appropriate long directory (see photo on nextpage(omitted)) that shows the first 255 characters of the story.andP;  If a storyis in use by someone else, this will be indicated by three small horizontalbars next to the catchline.andP;  In this case, the story can only be opened inread-only mode.andP;  With the medium and long directories, it is possible also togenerate selective directories, but only from within one's own basket.andP;  Deskaccessories can be used to search for catchlines anywhere in the system.andM;At the bottom of the directory are the selection fields.andP;  They enable theuser to build a selective directory based upon any one or more of thefollowing attributes: catchline, cover date, author, page, section of thepaper, and minimum and maximum article depth.andP;  One can also selectivelysearch for any string of characters within the first 255 characters of anystory.andP;  The speed of building a directory can be a limiting aspect of thesystem.andP;  However, this depends on how frequently directories have to bebuilt.andP;  To look at the short directory showing just the catchline is veryquick, but building the medium or long directories, particularly where thereare many items, can be very slow.andP;  We timed building a directory of the PressAssociation (PA) news wire basket in which there were 154 stories atBournemouth; it took much longer than we are used to with PC-based systemssuch as Novell.andP;  However, when we updated this directory five minutes later(when there were 156 stories), it took only around 15 seconds (still not fastenough) because it was updating the previous directory.andM;The first time a directory is built can be slow.andP;  (The times we were seeingwere on a network using LocalTalk rather than EtherTalk.) If a private basketdirectory is left open as the active window, it will automatically updateevery minute.andP;  The automatic update time of other directories is set by thesystem manager.andM;We discussed this limitation with Talbot management and were told that thiscould become much quicker if a directory build function were added forspecified directories as a background task on the network.andP;  This would bedone by having another Macintosh on the network purely monitoring directoryactivity and keeping directories up to date.andP;  At present, building adirectory is carried out over the network by the reporter's or subeditor'sMacintosh, not by the file server, so adding the background directory buildfunction is a simple task.andP;  Talbot commented that this operation couldpossibly be added as a function of the new Talbot file server software to runwithin the server.andM;Editorial operationsandM;For editorial operations, one would normally sec a split in the type ofMacintosh used for different functions.andP;  Reporters would generally use eithera Macintosh Plus or an SE with the normal 9&quot; screen, whereas subeditors andeditors would normally use a Macintosh IIcx with a 19&quot; monochrome monitor.andO;At the Bournemouth Evening Echo, the system was ordered before the MacintoshIIcx was available; all the subeditors or editors use Macintosh SE units with19&quot; add-on Radius monochrome monitors.andP;  Bournemouth uses both screens.andO;Generally, text editing is done on the 9&quot; monitor, whereas the large screenis used for directories and previewing of articles.andP;  One can, however, movethe text editing window onto the large screen.andP;  The Bournemouth staff hasfound that the use of two screens can be tiring, and it is planning to useMacintosh IIcx units with 19&quot; monitors where additional terminals are to be aandM;System operation is determined by the routing and copy managementcharacteristics defined via the setup program.andP;  Talbot provides anetwork-wide messaging system that enables messages to be sent to anyonelogged onto the system, including linking via the communications system toremote offices.andP;  This is not a full-mail system-it does not havemailboxes-but is used just to send messages that instantly appear in aseparate window of the recipient's screen.andP;  The recipient has to close thewindow when the message has been read.andP;  The message is not stored.andP;  Thesystem can be used to address a group of people selected from the list oflogged-on users, or messages can be broadcast to the whole network.andM;The NewsWrite message system is also employed by DAMS and the newswireservices sending messages of incoming flashes to designated users.andM;Reporters.andP;  The structure of a reporter's operation is defined at the time oflogon, which win set up access rights to baskets within the system.andP;  The timeand date can be set using the Talbot SeTime program, which can be run fromany terminal.andP;  The system looks up the time and date from the server andloads them into the local terminal.andP;  Although this procedure is normally runonly when clocks are changed, it could be included as part of the logonprocedure if required.andP;  This step ensures that the time, date and othersettings are the same throughout the system.andM;Unfortunately, QuickKeys settings can't be loaded into a keyboard at the sametime, so a user logging onto a different Macintosh would have to bringQuickKeys settings on a floppy disk and load them before logging on.andM;After logging on, a reporter can either create a new story or open anexisting story through access to the files by any of the types ofdirectories.andP;  When a new story is created, the header information window isopened, and then the text entry window opens.andP;  The latter can be sized toenable opening other windows on the screen for directories, other stories,etc.andP;  Multiple stories and a directory can be open on the screen at one time.andO;The command and tab keys are used together to move between different windows.andM;The header information window is used to define the operations that havetaken place on a story.andP;  It defines the original writer and all whosubsequently work on the story.andP;  It also defines the publishing date, thepage or area of the paper where it is to be placed, and if necessary whichpaper it is to go into.andP;  One can also add comments, whether there is apicture to go with the story, and also whether it is a rush story.andP;  Rushstories automatically go to the head of a directory in the assigned basket.andO;(Baskets are automatically sorted alphabetically.)andM;Not all items must be added when the story is first written.andP;  Talbot will adda full audit trail functionality to this window.andM;The text editor is relatively simple and has only limited functionalitycompared with some other products on the market.andP;  It makes use of both thekeyboard and the mouse, and it follows most Macintosh keyboard shortcutstandards.andM;The cursor keys provide basic cursor movement by character or fine.andP;  Usedwith the OPTION key, they move up and down in page increments.andP;  COMMAND andthe up and down arrows move up and down a paragraph at a time, and opTioN,COMMAND and up or down arrow moves to the top or bottom of the text.andO;Word-by-word movement left or right is enabled with the OPTION and left andright arrow keys.andM;OPTION plus BACKSPACE or CLEM deletes a word to the left or right of thecursor.andP;  BACKSPACE deletes a character to the left of the cursor, and CLEARto the right of the cursor.andM;The system uses normal click conventions with the mouse for selecting a wordwith two clicks, but three clicks selects a paragraph and four clicks thewhole text.andP;  (COMMAND A is used for preview mode.)andM;Other shortcuts that differ from Macintosh conventions are that CLEAR is usedto give a negative response to a selection box query (with RETURN giving thepositive response); the latest directory is updated by COMMAND plus SPACEBAR;and the next window is COMMAND plus TAB.andP;  Once an item is selected, cut andpaste operations are performed via the clipboard in normal Macintosh fashion.andO;A help screen shows the key functions.andP;  As a reporter is writing, acontinuously updated status field at the bottom of the window provides anestimated word count and a calculation of the depth of the article based upona standard column width for the paper.andP;  Words are counted as every sixcharacters, rather than as true words.andP;  (This is the normal practice whereeditorial staff have used this approach in a manual system; however, thesystem can be set up to give a true word count based on spaces.)andM;The standard system does not come with a spelling checker or thesaurusbecause a standard system for a reporter or subeditor does not have a harddisk in each Macintosh.andP;  If a hard disk is added to a Macintosh, anoff-the-shelf spelling checker or thesaurus can be run as a desk accessory.andO;Talbot may consider integrating a spelling checker or thesaurus if there is ademand for it.andM;A useful facility is &quot;clean up text.&quot; After a story h sent from a reporter toany other basket on the system, this facility corrects certain punctuationand text incompatibilities.andP;  For example, it changes inch marks to quotationmarks, inserts spaces after certain punctuation such as periods, and changesdouble spaces to single spaces.andP;  Items not covered properly by this routinecan be inserted in an exceptions file; for example, abbreviations such asi.e., eg.andP;  or C.I.A.andP;  would not have spaces added after the periods.andP;  Thereis also a &quot;change case&quot; feature where the highlighted text is changed fromupper to lower case or vice versa.andM;We would like to see a number of items added to the system.andP;  It would be niceto have a dual-key function to go the start or end of a line.andP;  While it ispossible to select a word and a paragraph with two or three clicks, it wouldbe useful to be able to select a sentence.andP;  There is no equivalent of theAtex/ XyWrite save/get facility where text or command strings can be assignedto any key.andP;  Many NewsWrite systems are installed with QuickKeys on thekeyboard to handle some of these tasks, but it would be nice to have amultiple Clipboard facility such as in the Paragon Nisus word processor.andM;Another Macintosh facility that would be useful, particularly with the smallscreen, would be the ability to split windows horizontally to look at onepart of a story while scrolling through another part of it for sub-editing,as in the Ragtime desktop product.andP;  This can be done using the split-screenfacility.andP;  If a story is opened twice, or if a second or subsequent story isopened, the screen is automatically split in half vertically.andP;  If the samestory is opened twice, the second has read-only status and it is possible todisplay the top of one story while the other is scrolled and edited.andM;In the same way, if two stories are on the screen at the same time, it wouldbe useful to scroll both texts synchronously.andM;Despite these perceived limitations, the program appears to work very welland is extremely easy to use.andP;  At all Talbot sites we have visited, the usershave commented on how quickly they learned to use the system.andP;  For areporter, the basic training time is usually less than half a day.andP;  Thesimple operation of the text editor and routing structure, plus the intuitiveMacintosh interface, is probably one reason for this.andM;Subediting (copy editing).andP;  The subediting program is an extension of thereporter program in that it has the same text editor, but it also has a fullcomposition and preview function.andP;  Because this is an editorial program,Talbot has moved some of its definitions away from those used in thecomposing room to ones that it feels are more in line with the manner of thejob in the editorial department.andP;  It uses the term 'style indicators&quot; forcodes, and &quot;copy shaping&quot; instead of typesetting.andP;  For this article, however,we shall usually employ the terms we are more used to rather than slippinginto the new Talbot editorial-speak.andM;Copy shaping can be run on a normal 9&quot; Macintosh screen, but with the numberof windows one would normally have open, Talbot always sells a 19&quot; monitorfor this function.andM;Composition can be carried out by adding specific command codes at therelevant points to define items such as font, point size, leading, columndepth and number of columns.andP;  One can also select a predefined style for thestory.andM;The formatting commands are quite different from those we normally see inMacintosh practice, although they work in a manner similar to those of DTI'sAdSpeed display ad makeup system with an editing window.andP;  The mouse and menusaren't used to select typefaces and styles.andP;  The editing window is totallynon-WYSIWYG.andP;  One can change the typeface and size of characters in the editwindow, but this is purely to assist in reading the data; it has no effect onthe composition, which is code driven.andP;  At any time one can open a preview ofthe article in a separate window using COMMAND A.andM;In the same fashion as with editing codes, a help window aids in usingtypesetting codes.andP;  There is a comprehensive range of codes for selectingtypesetting operations and for laying out copy over multiple columns and tospecified depths.andP;  Vertical markers define the vertical alignment positionfor the top of the next column.andP;  This feature would be used to define aposition in the text, normally the start of a paragraph, for examplefollowing a multicolumn introduction, where the next columns are to start.andO;Vertical markers are now practically obsolete in this mode of operation,though, because there is a facility for multiple top-of-text markers in eachcolumn that can be predefined in the first line of a style indicator to setthe start of the second and subsequent columns.andM;A similar concept has been implemented for defining the depth of each column.andO;This means that from within one set of style indicators (codes), it ispossible to determine the style and shape of a story.andP;  These indicators canbe assigned to function keys or style commands.andM;Predefined styles are selected by calling up the style box.andP;  One can ask fora list of styles or define one by its number.andP;  If a style is defined aseditable, it can be changed or used as the basis for a new style.andM;Styles are programmed using the NewsWrite composition codes.andP;  To apply thestyle, one uses the PREviEw button in the window.andP;  The style works on breakswithin the command string that are selected by embedding return codes in thetext.andP;  The preview is shown-against a page grid so one can see the correctsize and structure of the story.andP;  One can change the setting by selecting anew style and previewing it again.andP;  The preview is quick-it takes only a fewseconds.andM;NewsWrite has numerous standard box commands, and special effects can becreated, such as holly and snowflakes for use at Chrismas.andP;  These commandsdefine boxes with different comers, rule weights, shadings or invisiblesettings.andP;  The user selects the box style and defines the width and depth ofthe box.andP;  When text is set inside a box, the setting measure is automaticallyreduced to allow a margin based upon the box's rule weight.andM;Composition weakness.andP;  One of NewsWrite's chief limitations is itscomposition quality.andP;  It has some major deficiencies compared with othersystems and even compared with desktop publishing products.andP;  It supportssizes and leading in full-point increments only.andP;  The font set width can't bechanged independently of the type size.andM;The only kerning in the system is the kerning within the Adobe font metricfiles, plus a small number of Talbot's own kerned pairs, such as To.andP;  Talbotis planning to add manual kerning, and we understand it plans to provideuser-controlled kerning tables at the same time it adds fractional pointsizes.andP;  These are mainly restrictions imposed by use of the standardMacintosh Laserprep PostScript output routines, and Talbot will likely beable to improve its composition under Apple System 7 when it is available.andM;Among other perceived limitations, it is not possible to flow text aroundirregular shapes, or to set type at an angle.andP;  Text can only be set overdefined column structures (which, however, include bastard measure structuressuch as 3 columns on a 5-column grid); one cannot easily handle runarounds ofpictures or pun quotes, for example, that cut into columns.andP;  These operationshave to be done through use of the composition commands.andM;Another awkward area is dropped capitals.andP;  They can be created with commands,but that process requires a level of composition skill that most editorialstaff members do not have and should not need.andM;Since this is an editorial system rather than a production system, some itemsthat one would like to handle automatically are rather too code-intensive.andO;The system only outputs to a typesetter in PostScript code; however, with theera of high-speed PostScript starting for all PostScript suppliers at thiscoming Drupa, that is less of a problem than it used to be.andM;There are also other limitations of the subediting process.andP;  One cannotappend text directly from a directory to the end of an already open story;one must open a second story, select the text, then cut and paste it into thefirst open story.andP;  While one can search for any file by specificcharacteristics, one must do so within one's own volume, and then byindividual baskets.andM;There is no global search facility apart from the use of desk accessoriessuch as Find File, which can search for catchlines.andP;  The possible use ofstandard Macintosh products such as Mainstay's Marco Polo may provide thisfunction in the future.andM;The editing process is built around previewing stories for composition.andO;Hence, almost all stories are area composed into their final shape, ratherthan output as galleys.andP;  It appears to be easy to learn the structures of thearea composition mode.andP;  At Bournemouth, all subeditors arc making up allstories to their finished shape, and they have 84 set styles assigned tofunction keys for fast operation.andP;  The files are output on a MonotypeLasercomp Mk 2 or Monotype Express Series 3, both of which have Monotype'sPostScript RT.andM;Remote communications.andP;  One of NewsWrite's strongest points is its remotecommunications capability.andP;  Talbot offers a facility called DAMS (DialTextAutomatic Modem Server), which is built around one or more Macintoshes on thenetwork at the host site connected to modems.andP;  At a remote site, one wouldhave a similar Macintosh with a modem on a network.andP;  When copy needs to besent to the host site, an operator simply puts it into an output folder bypressing COMMAND 1.andP;  The story is automatically sent into a folder that theDAMS program would be polling, so the communications are transparent to theuser.andP;  The DAMS terminal automatically dials the host modem.andP;  The two unitscommunicate, and the copy is sent to the host site.andP;  This process is totallytransparent to the user.andM;At Bournemouth there are four remote sites linked into the central operation.andO;At the Southern Echo in Southampton there are 13 such remote offices linkedto the central site via dial-up telephone fines with automatic routing ofstories to Atex queues.andM;The DAMS system is used where copy is automatically sent from one site toanother.andP;  If, however, one needs to link the sites so that users at theremote site have access to the file servers, as may be the case in a remotenewsroom, then one uses the Talbot Bridge software.andP;  It enables two networksat remote sites to be connected together over either standard telephone linesor higher-speed leased lines.andP;  Talbot mainly uses Bridge for remote systemssupport, but it can also be used in an editorial or production environment.andM;NewsWrite is also excellent for handling wire service operations.andP;  There is aseparate Macintosh for each news wire, and the directory of wire servicestories is available to any user.andP;  There is also a facility to broadcast amessage to defined subeditors or news editors every time a new wire servicestory is received, giving the first line of the story.andP;  This message appearsas a separate window on the user's screen.andM;At another customer site, a DAMS system is used to send text data from aHarris ad booking system directly into Quark Xpress, which is used fordisplay ad makeup.andM;PaginationandM;One item drawing our attention to Talbot, particularly recently, has been itspagination approach.andP;  We have seen the system grow toward pagination for sometime with the development of area makeup and the use of styles.andM;Early last year, we saw some initial developments toward pagination; theywere more a case of bringing multiple area-composed stories together on apage.andP;  It was at IFRA, however, that we saw the true pagination system forthe first time.andP;  We had hoped to see it in live production at Bournemouth,but the newspaper has yet to conclude a union agreement to start using it forlive pages.andM;The setup we saw at IFRA is not the only approach to pagination that Talbotoffers.andP;  The system being developed for The Financial Times approachespagination from a different area-page design-for a layout-driven paginationapproach.andP;  Its operation will be detailed below.andM;We are also seeing the potential of the interactive multiuser pagination andthe multiuser design-driven pagination linked by the NewsWrite editorialsystem.andP;  With some planned enhancements to the editorial system to integratewith the design-driven pagination, this appears to be an extremely powerfuland flexible editorial approach.andM;Interactive makeup.andP;  The interactive multiuser pagination is the product thatwe called probably the highlight of the last fall's IFRA show.andP;  It gives adegree of layout-driven pagination and handles interactive makeup.andP;  It isunique in that one can have multiple users working on a page at the sametime, but purely on the story or stories they are responsible for.andM;The editing and composition structure of the pagination system is identicalto that of the current area composition.andP;  In fact, one works with exactly thesame software and operating procedures within a page.andP;  The pagination allowsmultiple stories to be combined on a page.andM;The system is currently in testing at a number of Talbot sites.andP;  One of theseis Bournemouth, which is waiting for a union agreement.andM;Pagination can start with the creation of a page layout.andP;  Articles aredefined by drawing their areas as separate boxes; these can be named and astyle (the same as in the area composition facility) can be attached to them.andO;The defined page layout is stored as a page; it is seen as a small version ofthe page within the directory structure when one looks at the page directory.andO;If the page is made up, it will be seen with all the elements that have beencompleted.andP;  More than one user can open a single page.andP;  However, one can belocked out from particular stories by the access structure associated witheach page element.andP;  This structure can define an access level for editing,reading or moving elements on a page.andM;The unique aspect of the Talbot system is not that it can do this, but thateverything that is happening on the page of one terminal is shown on the pageof other terminals at almost the same time, so one can see exactly what ishappening.andP;  It also means that if your access code is high enough, you canintervene and work with the second user on the same area of the page.andM;A user reads in the preplanned layout, accesses the relevant story from thedirectories, attaches the story to the specific area in the layout, andrequests a preview.andP;  The area composition software then comes into place,picking up the style file associated with the layout and composing the copyto fit the space.andP;  One uses the existing subediting procedures to fit thearticle to the space.andM;The system supports most Macintosh graphic formats, including EPS, PICT,TIFF, RIFF and MacPaint.andP;  One can scale and crop images and tonally adjusthalftones.andP;  Halftones are shown on the screen as two bits deep.andP;  The imagesshown here use a nongray-level Radius monitor.andM;At present the system will show the effect of halftone screening by selectingan area of the image and showing the halftone dot structure.andP;  It simulatesthe standard PostScript screening algorithm with the specified screen angleand screen mesh.andP;  This simulation is based upon 300-dpi output.andP;  Thisresolution is apparently inappropriate because one would normally expect tooutput halftones at a resolution of at least 1,000 dpi.andP;  In that case, theTalbot facility, which seems to have been developed more to show halftones ona nongray-scale monitor, does not appear to be very usable.andP;  It would be moreappropriate where images are to be worked upon on a page to have a fullgray-scale monitor to see the true effect of changes to images.andM;The image control in the program demonstrated was set at 300 dpi tocorrespond to a LaserWriter.andP;  If a 1,000-dpi output unit were to be used, theprogram would be set up for that; this setting will be user-configurable inthe eventual release of the program.andP;  The dot structure and angle are alreadytunable, so at 1,000 dpi the lines-per-inch setting would also be changed.andM;Talbot claims that this feature gives the user more than the standardMacintosh page makeup packages because the user can adjust the black-to-whiteratio.andP;  We have yet to see this in operation with higher-resolution-baseddata and output devices, so we are unable to comment upon how successful theNewsWrite Image Control function is.andM;Layout-driven pagination.andP;  The layout-driven (design-driven) paginationapproach being developed for The Financial Times is based upon major elementsof the interactive pagination program.andP;  It is a system for creatingelectronic dummies of pages, and for specifying the style to be used, largelyby defaults for defined areas.andP;  The initial implementation is for sending thegeometry and defined composition styles into another system, which will thenbe responsible for all editorial writing to fit, composition, page assemblyof all the composed elements, and output to the  Wetter.andM;The system's current interface runs one way from the Talbot system into theeditorial system, which in the case of The Financial Times is SII.andP;  Tooperate, the system needs a corresponding interface on the editorial systemto accept the geometry and composition commands.andP;  In the case of TheFinancial Times, this interface is written using SII's STYL language.andP;  Thehardware connection is a serial link; input into the SII system is via thewire input facility.andM;The first step in operating the pagination system is to log on.andP;  One thenchooses the grid format to be used.andP;  One can change the grid structure anunlimited number of times if necessary while designing the page in order tohave different grids in operation on the same page.andM;From the same header window, one specifies the cover date of the publication;the version, which in the case of The Financial Times covers London, Europe,the U.S.andP;  or Japan; the edition number being worked upon; and the pagenumber.andP;  This selection brings up the blank page grid plus the toolbox.andP;  Inthe case of The Financial Times, the page grid is based upon 9-point units tofit the modular design structure of the paper.andM;A counter in the toolbox always shows the number of the vertical grid lineupon which the cursor is resident at that time.andP;  When any item of the toolboxis selected the system is then placing such elements on the page.andP;  Storiesare used whenever a text element is being specified; art covers line art;ads, shown by the word &quot;sale' in the toolbox, is used for placement ofdisplay ads; tables for bar charts, graphs, etc.; halftones-, section headsfor defining mastheads on the page; read-throughs, which are where a separatestory or pull-out from a story is placed within a defined story area; linesfor placing rule elements; the line count for the current cursor position onthe grid; and the wastebasket (trash can).andP;  If a color monitor is used, theseelements are shown in different colors; otherwise they use a differentshading pattern.andM;The user generally starts with the defined elements, such as section heads,ads, and standard layout styles like main stories that generally remain thesame.andP;  To place an item, one selects the type of element from the toolbox andpoints with the mouse to the desired starting position.andP;  The grid line numberindicator in the toolbox ensures accuracy.andP;  A snap-to-grid facility ensuresthat the start point is both horizontally and vertically correct.andM;The size of the defined area can be specified in two ways.andP;  One can hold themouse button down with one click and drag to the finishing bottom-rightposition, or if one double-clicks the mouse a dialog box comes up and oneenters the size of the element from the keyboard.andM;If one is defining a story, one now brings up the headblock to define oradjust the default composition settings for that item.andP;  The headblocksettings cover all the elements in the story.andP;  One sees here the definitionof the strap, headline, byline, text and crosshead.andP;  This corresponds to thestyle of the paper, which does not use a separate intro structure.andP;  Thedefinitions for this cover the type size, the font and the setting mode,which if not indicated is always justified.andM;Other elements only apply to specific items such as decks against strap,headline and byline, which indicate how many lines are to be used, &quot;In&quot; forindent against text, &quot;Rule&quot; for strap and crosshead, and &quot;Col&quot; for number ofcolumns the text is to be set over.andP;  One can assign bastard measures such as4 columns over a 5-column grid.andP;  One would apply the assigned name for thestory, which, when linked with the SII system, is the Financial Times &quot;GetName&quot; field in the SII editorial header for the story.andP;  This approach is usedto automatically link the layout to the file within the SII system.andM;As one assigns a story, or any element, its size is shown at itsbottom-right-hand comer.andP;  For stories, the size is shown as both the numberof lines of 9-point type in the story and the block depth of the article.andO;For example, Story1 is 229 lines of text.andP;  This is set over four columns, andthe overall depth of the article is 114 lines.andP;  One can confirm thismeasurement against the grid line marker at the left side of the page.andP;  Otherelements, such as ads, pictures and read-throughs, just show the depth of theitem.andM;One can change any element through the headblock.andP;  When it is called upduring placing of a story, the defaults for the page and that area of thepage are shown.andP;  In most cases, in order to correspond with the default styleof the paper, one would not adjust the defaults, but just assign the storyname.andM;For placing elements on a page, there is a 'gravity' facility thatautomatically places items at the lowest or highest available position in thecolumn.andP;  The Financial Times refers to placement at the highest point in thecolumn as a 'levity facility.' n using levity or gravity, one simply assignsthe element to the column; it then automatically moves up or down to theavailable position.andP;  In doing so, it takes into account the defined defaultspace between items.andM;When the page is saved, it is held in the Talbot file server under a pagenumber.andP;  The system has a structure similar to that defined in this article,with backed-up file servers.andP;  The Financial Times is expected to use the newTalbot server s with Ethernet links between all terminals.andM;The system appears fast in defining pages.andP;  As we stated earlier, in testsThe Financial Times is designing pages in around six minutes, but as thespecification is completed it anticipates being able to reduce these times.andO;Where it sees major benefits of the system, though, is in changing the layoutof the paper when new copy comes in for edition changes.andP;  The ability to moveelements on a page or onto another page, and for them to pick up the defaultsfor that area, is seen as timesaving.andM;If one is updating a page, it is recalled from the directory.andP;  One sees thepages available, and by moving the mouse to point to each one, one sees smallrepresentations of the page layout.andM;For moving items on a page, the move tool is quite handy.andP;  One can move itemsby dragging them or with the pointer tool-a tool with arrows pointing north,south, east and west, as well as northeast, southeast, southwest andnorthwest.andP;  If one points to any arrow and clicks the mouse, the story willautomatically move in the chosen direction using the gravity or levity modes.andO;It will avoid any element that is already placed.andM;In a similar fashion to the interactive pagination system, one can view morethan one page at a time.andP;  In fact, up to 16 small views of pages can be onthe screen at once, so one can see the overall view of a section of thepaper.andP;  The pages shown do not have to be sequential; one can select from themenu the pages to see.andM;The system permits multiple people to work on designing a page.andP;  In the samemanner as the interactive pagination system, one sees all the activity thatis happening on the other terminals as it is happening.andP;  It may seem strangeto have more than one person designing a page, but in The Financial Timesthis often happens when features and news staff are working on the same page.andM;Talbot's system also suits the concept of a page design conference wherestaff are working in different parts of the building, or in differentbuildings and communicating by telephone.andP;  The Financial Times is notplanning to have U.S.andP;  staff planning pages together with UK staff, but thedesign structure of the system (including Talbot's Bridge communicationssystem) would allow this.andP;  Technological developments might change the way ofworking in a manner that previously would not have been possible.andM;There is still a lot to come in this system.andP;  We are told that only 60% ofthe agreed specification between The Financial Times and Talbot has beencompleted (in two months of development).andP;  For example, one cannot jumpstories at present, although it is planned.andP;  The Financial Times does verylittle story jumping.andP;  One also cannot build a double-page spread; all pagescurrently are separate elements.andM;Talbot also plans to link its layout-driven system with its interactivesystem, which should produce an extremely powerful product.andM;FuturesandM;Talbot currently is offering an editorial solution plus pagination.andP;  Itsometimes is left out of a bid because it has no full-specificationclassified ad facility and a newspaper wants a single supplier for the totalsystem.andM;Initially, Talbot developed a simple classified system using the Omnisdatabase, but it was only suitable as a simple production-based system.andP;  Thefirm is developing a full classified system, of which it has installed onepart with a customer.andP;  The classified system lacks database facilities; whatis currently working is more just a small booking system.andP;  Talbot is nowlooking at how to extend this into a full classified system, including whicharchitecture to use for the file server and network and which database touse.andP;  The vendor is talking about completing this system by the end of 1990.andM;There are many items still to complete on The Financial Times layout-drivenpagination system, but no dates are being given yet.andP;  The potential of likingthis system with the current editorial and pagination systems is veryinteresting.andP;  Among the items being looked at is lifting the headblock styledefinition structure from the layout program and using it in the normalsubediting and composition program to improve the functionality and ease ofuse in this area.andM;There are plans to have an automatic attach capability to connect the layoutdefinitions to stories so they would automatically come into the page whencompleted, rather than having to call them in and attach them to the layout.andO;This approach would provide the same functionality as the CCI Watchdogfacility (also seen at IFRA  89; see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  5, p. 5) to allow anynumber of pages to be open on screen, and whenever a story is allocated andsized according to the layout, to have it appear on the screen of themonitoring terminal.andP;  The newspaper's production status could be monitored.andM;The new Talbot server is still to have its first installation.andP;  However, itis likely to expand the potential of the system when fully available.andO;Talbot's plans to have additional Macintosh units as network processors formoving data around, for providing continuous directory budding, and forbackup further improves the future speed and functions of the system.andM;Sample System PricingandM;As an indication of system pricing, we asked Talbot to provide approximatepricing of a 40-terminal NewsWrite editorial and page makeup system designedto a high specification.andP;  The total price includes installation and trainingto take place outside England.andP;  (In the UK, the price would be slightlylower.) All components are equipped to run on Ethernet cabling except the 25reporter terminals, which will run on LocalTalk with a FastPath connection tothe Ethernet backbone.andP;  The price does not include a typesetter.andP;  The totalprice of [British pounds] 250,000 ($410,000) includes a small hardwarediscount and system software.andP;  Hardware:andM;* 3 servers based on Mac IIci computers, each with two 300-MB disk drives,plus one emergency server and one Mover (SE);andM;* 5 Mac IIcx page makeup terminals with extended keyboards and large Radiusscreens;andM;* 1 Mac IIcx system management terminal;andM;* 10 standard SEs for subeditors;andM;* 4 SEs, including two for wire service terminals, one modem terminal forremote diagnostics and an automatic print server;andM;* 25 Mac Pluses for reporters;andM;* 2 copy routers;andM;* 2 Mac IIcx graphics terminals with 200-MB WORM drives, 4 or 8 MB Of memoryand large monitors;andM;* 3 Apple portable terminals, 1 Agfa focus scanner and 4 modems.andM;Software includes licenses to run NewsWrite editorial and interactivepagination; software for the server, network and OCR; and some off-the-shelfprograms: MacDraw, SuperPaint, illustrator and Multi-Ad Creator.andM;To run the layout-driven pagination program as at The Financial Times,, anadditional expenditure of not more than [British pounds] 10,500 would providesoftware plus a Mac IIcx with a Radius 2-page, 8-bit color monitor.andP;  Thislayout workstation hasn't been integrated into the rest of the Talbot system,though, so it would be used to send geometry into another system.andM;ConclusionandM;At the start of this article we stated that one of our questions was whethera Macintosh editorial system could match the capabilities, performance andsize of a PC-based editorial system.andP;  From what we have seen of Talbot, thereis little doubt that it can.andM;There are certainly many limitations in the use of a total Macintosh platformfor editorial systems.andP;  Many of these limitations arc the result ofAppleShare, which certainly is not as robust as Novell Netware, Unixnetworking or (in the future) OS/2 Lan Manager.andP;  However, Talbot hasimplemented what appear to be excellent workarounds to make AppleShare aviable file server and network manager for a secure, fast newspaper system.andO;The new Talbot server, plus the use of background network processors, shouldcertainly improve the situation.andP;  It also has an extreme limitation incomposition quality, although not all newspapers would find this asignificant factor.andP;  We hope Talbot will work on its composition with an eyetoward at least meeting the average standard of the market.andM;The NewsWrite system currently uses the Apple HFS filing structures, but itdoes not yet support any database storage.andP;  We do not yet know whether thenew structure will be suitable as the system moves to the use of a databasefor classified ads and management of all the page elements in a system.andM;As a working system, there is no doubt that NewsWrite holds it own withPC-based editorial systems.andP;  It appears to be easier to use and certainlymore friendly.andP;  The training times we have been told of are a fraction ofthose of other systems.andP;  It is the norm for a reporter to be operationalafter two hours of training, and a subeditor after less than two days.andM;NewsWrite does not have all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; that come with an Atex,SII, or even a XyWrite-based system for editing functions, but many peopledon't make use of more than a small subset of these systems' functions on aday-to-day basis.andP;  Most NewsWrite users are making extensive use of areacomposition for almost all work, something you certainly won't find with manyother systems.andM;In pagination, the system offers a unique capability that has real potential,and when the layout-driven pagination is integrated with both the editorialsystem and the interactive pagination, it appears to offer paginationflexibility beyond that of most systems.andM;We also see the potential for the layout-driven pagination approach that isbeing developed for The Financial Times to open up many new marketopportunities for Talbot.andP;  With the delays by many of the major vendors inmoving to a working and cost-effective pagination system, there must be agreat opportunity for Talbot to find other major newspapers that would liketo take the same route as The Financial Times.andM;The attractiveness of the pagination program, coupled with the nice userinterface, makes us want to view this system as a candidate for mostnewspapers.andP;  But we need to be cautious when it comes to major metropolitandailies, which have yet to find good solutions even among robust Novellnetworks and smooth XyWrite editorial functions.andP;  It is still too soon topredict how large a paper could get by with a Talbot system.andM;The other major consideration is size and funding.andP;  Talbot is still a tinycompany, with minimal sales capability and no international distribution,that is wholly owned by one person.andP;  To exploit its very real potential,Talbot needs to put together an agreement for internationaldistribution-ideally with one company-rather than with separate smallcompanies in different parts of the world.andP;  The support costs of the latterapproach would be high initially for a small company.andM;Talbot is certainly interested in expanding its market penetration, and itmay even consider a suitable external investment.andP;  To test the temperature ofthe water for these possibilities, it will be showing its systems for thefirst time in the U.S.andP;  at the Seybold Seminars '90 in Boston next month.andM;Talbot Publishing Systems Ltd. 293/5 Charminster Road Bournemouth, DorsettBH8 9QW, England Phone: {44} (0202) 536135 Fax: {44} (0202) 530685</TEXT></DOC>
