UAL Corp. and USAir Group Inc. recorded net losses whileDelta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each eked out smallprofits.</LP><TEXT>   It is the second consecutive quarter that airline resultshave plunged. The primary culprit was an unexpected surge inthe cost of aviation fuel.   UAL said the average price per gallon of fuel in the firstquarter rose to 73.3 cents, compared with 60.7 cents a yearearlier. The company said the rise contributed to a 23% jumpin fuel expense to $386 million from $315 million. Delta saidthat fuel expense rose 27% and that it consumed 5% more thanin the year-earlier fiscal third quarter.   &quot;The thing that just kicked everybody in the pants wasfuel,&quot; said Vivian Lee, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. She estimated that in some cases fuel costs rose 30% froma year earlier.   Comparisons with the year-earlier period also were hurtbecause the busy Easter weekend this year didn't come untilafter March 31. Last year, airlines also reaped a windfallbecause of the strike at Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines.Even with its return, however, Eastern hasn't recaptured thatmany passengers, particularly the high-paying businesstraveler who is the meat-and-potatoes flier for mostcarriers.   Carriers attempted to boost their financial performancethis year by raising fares several times, but the increasesapparently didn't offset the higher cost of fuel. USAir alsosaid it was hurt by the number of free tickets it shelled outunder its frequent-flier program.   UAL, parent company of United Airlines, had a loss of$36.4 million, or $1.68 a share, compared with year-earlierprofit of $65.4 million, or $3.03 cents a share.   The Chicago-based carrier was particularly hurt by aone-time, nonoperating charge of a $77.5 million settlementit paid to Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit. Thesettlement covered several lawsuits in which United wascharged with unfairly competing in the computer-reservationbusiness.   Revenue rose 8.1% to $2.52 billion from $2.33 billion. Ata shareholders' meeting, UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said hewas &quot;clearly disappointed&quot; by the results. Without theone-time charge, results would have still been poor, he said.   UAL stock fell 25 cents yesterday to close at $152.50 ashare in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   USAir reported a first-quarter loss of $38 million, or$1.05 a share, compared with net of $15.5 million, or 35cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue barely increased to$1.54 billion from $1.48 billion.   Jack T. Ciesielski, an airline analyst at Legg Mason WoodWalker Inc. in Baltimore, said improvements in on-timeperformance and pilot scheduling kept USAir's results fromlooking worse. Problems in both areas hampered the carrierthrough the fourth quarter.   USAir stock rose 25 cents to close at $27.50 inyesterday's Big Board trading.   Although both Delta and Southwest reported profits,earnings were sharply down from a year earlier.   Delta said net income fell 63% to $31.3 million, or 48cents a share, from $85 million, or $1.73 a share, a yearearlier. Like its competitors, Delta blamed the decreaseprimarily on the soaring cost of jet fuel. But the carrieracknowledged it would be hard-pressed to match theyear-earlier numbers, when traffic was inflated by the strikeat Eastern that sent travelers scurrying to Delta.   Still, Delta was able to increase its revenue 4% to $2.12billion from $2.04 billion. Strong business traffic, higherfares and more cargo business helped keep revenue high, saidThomas Roeck, Delta's chief financial officer.   In the first nine months, Delta net fell 15% to $228.7million, or $4.15 a share, from $270.1 million, or $5.49 ashare, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.8% to $6.34 billionfrom $5.78 billion.   In the quarter, Delta bought back 2,988,200 common sharesfor $202.3 million, bringing the total number of sharesbought back to 6,255,662, at a total cost of $438.8 million.Last year, in an effort to make a takeover of the companymore difficult, Delta placed 14% of its shares in an employeestock option plan and sold 5% stakes each to friendlycarriers, Singapore Airlines and Swissair.   Delta stock rose $1.125 a share yesterday to close at $74in Big Board composite trading.   Southwest's first-quarter net fell 74% to $5.1 million, or18 cents a share, from $19.6 million, or 64 cents a share, ayear earlier. Dallas-based Southwest said higher fuel pricespushed its operating expenses up 21.7%.   In addition, the carrier said profit was further squeezedby a decrease in nonoperating gains of $7.2 million. Thefirst quarter of 1989 was a record for Southwest.   Still, revenue rose 14% to $260.6 million from $229.4million.   In a statement, Herbert D. Kelleher, Southwest's chairman,president and chief executive officer, said he was grateful&quot;to report even a meager first-quarter profit.&quot; He called themost recent period &quot;one of the most difficult quarters in thehistory of the airline industry.&quot;   Southwest's stock rose 25 cents yesterday to close at$24.25 a share in Big Board trading.   AMR Corp., American Airlines' parent and the first carrierto release March 31 quarter results, set the tone for theindustry last week when it reported a $19.3 million loss.   Of the major airline holding companies, only Pan Am Corp.and Texas Air have yet to report results. They aren'texpected to buck the industry trend; analysts figure theirresults will disclose big first-quarter losses.</TEXT></DOC>
