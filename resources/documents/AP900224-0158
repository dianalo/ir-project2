Neptune is now the outermost planet. Pluto currently is closerto the sun in an elongated, elliptical orbit, part of which isbeyond Neptune's path.   By crossing Neptune's orbit Friday at a distance of 2.8 billionmiles from Earth, Pioneer 11 followed Pioneer 10 and Voyagers 1 and2 out of the solar system, said Peter Waller, spokesman for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames ResearchCenter in Mountain View.   Both officials acknowledged that some don't consider the orbitof the outermost planet to be the edge of the solar system. Somescientists consider the true edge to be the heliopause, where solarwind yields to interstellar wind an estimated 5 billion to 14billion miles from the sun.   A few even consider the solar system to end at the Oort Cloud, atheorized but yet-unseen spherical cloud of comets that may belocated about 7 trillion to 14 trillion miles from the sun.   Waller said NASA considers the Pioneers and Voyagers to beoutside the solar system because _ to use a seafaring analogy _``once you've left land behind, you don't worry about coastalwaters.''   Pioneer 11 was launched April 5, 1973, and visited Jupiter onDec. 2, 1974, a year after Pioneer 10 flew past the solar system'slargest planet. Pioneer 11 whizzed by Jupiter at 107,373 mph, whichWaller said was the fastest speed ever traveled by a spacecraft.   It passed only 26,600 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops _ muchcloser than the Voyager 1 and 2 flybys in 1979 _ and was bombardedby the planet's intense radiation belts.   On Sept. 1, 1979, it became the first spacecraft to exploreSaturn, visiting the ringed planet 14 months ahead of Voyager 1 andtwo years ahead of Voyager 2. Pioneer 10 didn't fly past Saturn.   Waller said in a telephone interview that Pioneer 11 flew about13,000 miles from Saturn, taking the first closeup pictures of thatplanet, discovering two small moonlets and a ring, and collectingdata that scientists used to determine that the major moon, Titan,was too cold for life despite the presence of organic chemicals.   Although Pioneer 11 was launched four years before the Voyagers,it took longer to fly beyond the outermost planet's orbit becauseit is traveling through space in the same direction as the sun andthe rest of the solar system, Male said.   In June 1983, Pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to passbeyond the planets. It is now 4.5 billion miles from Earth, Malesaid.   In three years, it will become difficult to simultaneouslyoperate Pioneer 11's radio transmitter and scientific instruments,although engineers may be able to get the spacecraft to send backdata on solar wind until 1995, project manager Richard Fimmel said.   Pioneer 10, with a stronger power supply, may return informationthrough the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
