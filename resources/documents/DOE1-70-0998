Synedra has shown speciallystrong sensitivity to UV-B radiation, whereas the Lithodesmium speciesisolated in Japan has been less damaged in the experiments. Uptake of/sup 15/N-ammonium is much more affected than the uptake of /sup 15/N-nitrate.Experiments with Ditylum have shown that exposure to UV-B radiation atdifferent times of the day produces effects. Different response to UV-Bexposure with simultaneous exposure to monochromatic light has likewisebeen observed. The reversible UV-B induced damage observed after thefirst day of exposure becomes irreversible upon second exposure. Thepattern of /sup 14/C- and /sup 15/N-labelled amino acids is significantlychanged by UV-B stress. (orig./KG) With 50 refs., 15 tabs., 51 figs..</TEXT></DOC>
