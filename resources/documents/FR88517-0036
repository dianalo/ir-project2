Therefore,neither an environmental assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statementis needed.This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115 (June 24, 1983).The 1987 Act amended the 1949 Act with respect to the 1988-90 crops ofwheat, feed grains, upland and ELS cotton, and rice.Generally, these amendments provide that:(1) Minimum target prices for the 1988 and 1989 crops of wheat, feed grains,upland cotton, ELS cotton, and rice will be lowered;(2) The reduction in price support rates for the 1988 crops which wouldhave occurred in accordance with the 1949 Act will be limited;(3) A voluntary paid land diversion program for corn, sorghum, and barleywith an acreage diversion requirement of 10 percent and a payment rateof $1.75 per bushel for corn (other payment rates to be established inrelation to corn) will be in effect for 1988;(4) Adjustments of wheat and feed grain county price support rates whichreflect transportation differentials may not exceed more than the percentagechange in the national average price support rate plus or minus 2 percentfor the 1988-90 crops;(5) A 1988 crop oats acreage limitation program not to exceed 5 percentwill be in effect;(6) Minimum Farmer-Owned Reserve levels for wheat and feed grains willbe reduced to 300 million bushels and 450 million bushels, respectively;(7) Additional yield payments for the 1988-1990 crops will be made to producersof wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice if the farm program paymentyield is reduced by more than 10 percent below the 1985 program paymentyield;(8) Advance deficiency payments will be made available with respect tothe 1988-90 crops to wheat and feed grains producers at not less than 40percent, nor more than 50 percent, of the projected payment rate, and forrice and uplance cotton producers, not less than 30 percent, nor more than50 percent, of the projected payment rate;(9) Advanced emergency compensation payments will be made to wheat producerswho elect, at signup, to receive 75 percent of the projected additionaldeficiency payment (the ``Findley'' payment) in December of the respectivewheat marketing year;(10) Haying and grazing of acreage designated as conservation use (CU)and acreage conservation reserve (ACR) shall be permitted, except duringany consecutive 5-month period between April 1 and October 31 as designatedby the State Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation (ASC) committees.However, haying and grazing shall not be permitted for any crop if theSecretary determines that haying and grazing would have an adverse economiceffect in the State. In the case of a natural disaster, the Secretary maypermit unlimited haying and grazing on such acreage;(11) An optional acreage diversion program, commonly referred to as ``0/92,''will be available to producers of the 1988-1990 crops of wheat and feedgrains. Producers may devote all or a portion of the permitted acreageto CU and receive deficiency payments on an acreage not to exceed 92 percentof the crops permitted acreage. The deficiency payment rate on the CU acreagewill not be less than the estimated deficiency payment rate. The Secretaryis required to implement the program in such a manner as to minimize theadverse effects on agriculturally related economic interests within anycounty, State or region taking into consideration acreage idled under otherprice support, production adjustment, or conservation programs;<ITAG tagnum="84">General Information</ITAG>General descriptions of the statutory basis for the determinations thatare set forth in this notice are set forth in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Vol. 52, No. 61, Page 15358; No. 136, Page 26707;No. 137, Page 27032; No. 175, Page 34262; and No. 201, Page 38806.Public comments were recorded and presented before the Secretary priorto the final program provision determinations. Comments received duringthe specified comment period are summarized below for the 1988 commodityprograms of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, ELS cotton and rice.Wheat and Common Program CommentsA total of 72 respondents commented on the 1988 Wheat and Common Programdeterminations. Thirty-two of the respondents were individual producersand twenty were producer organizations.Common Program ProvisionsWith respect to the specific comments for the Common Program Provisionsof the 1988 crops of Wheat, Feed Grains, Upland and ELS Cotton, and Ricethe following are noted:(a) <T3>Approved Nonprogram Crops (ANPC) and Haying and Grazing on ACR andCU Acres:</T3> Fifty-six respondents opposed ANPC production and hayingand grazing of ACR and CU acreage and 43 favored such action. Plantingof ANPC and haying of ACR and CU acreage will not be permitted, exceptunder emergency conditions, because of the otherwise adverse economic effectsuch a determination would have on producers who already grow such crops.However, the haying prohibition may be waived if it is determined by theState ASC Committee that the additional haying will not have an adverseeconomic effect. Grazing of ACR and CU is permitted except during any 5-consecutive-monthperiod between April 1 and October 31 as designated by the State ASC committees.(b) <T3>Advance Payments:</T3> Twenty-three respondents favored advanced programpayments and 1 respondent opposed such payments. Advance deficiency paymentsof 40 percent of the projected payment were announced in order to provideprogram participants with sufficient operating funds.(c) <T3>Cross Compliance:</T3> Twenty respondents favored limited cross complianceand 1 respondent opposed such action. These compliance requirements wereimplemented in order to ensure that desired levels of stocks for all programcommodities are attained.(d) <T3>Offsetting Compliance: </T3>Sixteen respondents opposed offsettingcompliance and 5 favored such action. These compliance requirements willnot be implemented due to: (1) The stautory prohibition of such actionsrelative to rice and upland cotton; and (2) the likely decrease in thelevel of program participation that otherwise would have occurred underthe wheat, feed grains, and ELS cotton programs. The higher level of participationachieved by not requiring offsetting compliance will likely result in greateroverall program effectiveness.(e) <T3>Farm Acreage Base (FAB) Adjustment: </T3>Sixteen respondents favoredthe 10 percent FAB adjustment provision and 5 opposed such adjustments.The FAB adjustment program will not be implemented because: (1) Significantbudget increses would occur; (2) producers would be discouraged producersfrom reacting to appropriate market signals and instead seek to capitalizeon favorable Government programs; and (3) additional excess productionwould be stimulated in those commodities with favorable payment programs.(f) <T3>Advance Recourse Loans:</T3> Four respondents favored advance loansand 3 opposed the use of such loans. Advance recourse loans will not beoffered because: (1) Sufficient operating funds are available for the 1988crop; and (2) such a program could place unnecessary encumbrances uponcrops that have not been produced, resulting in increased financial stressfor producers.(g) <T3>Miltiyear Set-Asides:</T3> Eight respondents favored multiyear set-asidesand 4 opposed such a program. This program will not be implemented becausethe expected acres idled under the ALP, PLD, and conservation reserve program(CRP) are considered adequate for the purpose of supply management of programcommodities.(h) <T3>Interest Payment Certificates (IPC):</T3> Seven respondents favoredinterest payment certificates and 4 opposed the use of such certificates.IPC will not be used because the existing generic certificate exchangeprocedure will provide sufficient opportunities to producers to use suchcertificates in the orderly marketing of commodities.(i) Eight comments were received that related to issues for which commentswere not requested.With respect to the specific comments for the 1988 Wheat Program the followingare noted:(a) <T3>Acreage Limitation Program (ALP):</T3> Twenty-seven respondents favoredan acreage reduction level of 27.5 percent or less, 6 favored 30 percent.The announced ALP level of 27.5 percent is 2.5 percent below the statutorymaximum. The 1949 Act provides that an ALP of less than 30 percent andmore than 20 percent must be implemented if it is determined that a carryoverof 1 billion bushels of wheat will exist on June 1, 1988. When the ALPwas announced, it had been determined that this carryover would be 1.778billion bushels. Based upon this estimate it was determined that an ALPof 27.5 percent would result in a decline in carryover stocks while exportdemands could still be met.(b) <T3>Established ``Target'' Price:</T3> Eighteen respondents favored a targetprice level of $4.38 per bushel, the 1987 level, 10 favored $4.29 per bushel,and 2 favored parity. The target price is set at the statutory minimumof $4.23 per bushel provided for in the 1987 Act. This level is well abovethe projected U.S. average variable cash costs of production for the 1988-crop,thereby ensuring program participants an adequate safety net for farm income.(c) <T3>Loan and Purchase Level:</T3> Twenty-nine comments were received regardingthe establishment of the wheat price support loan level. Twelve respondentsfavored $2.17 per bushel, the lowest level recommended. The remaining 17respondents favored higher price support loan levels ranging from $2.22per bushel to $3.00 per bushel. The minimum statutory loan level of $2.21per bushel was selected because: (1) Average farm prices during the precedingmarketing year did not exceed 110 percent of the loan rate; (2) this levelis necessary to maintain a competitive market position; and (3) the loanrate is well above the projected U.S. average variable cash cost of productionfor the 1988 crop.(d) <T3>Land Diversion Program:</T3> Twenty-six respondents favored a paiddiversion program and 3 opposed such a program. A paid diversion programwill not be implemented because the ALP level was determined to be sufficientto adequately manage stock levels.(e) <T3>Marketing Loan:</T3> Sixteen respondents favored a marketing loan programand 3 opposed its implementation. A marketing loan will not be implementedbecause: (1) The loan rate was determined capable of maintaining competitivemarketing positions; and (2) implementation would have greatly increasedprogram costs with only a marginal increase in export demand.(f) <T3>Commodity Certificates:</T3> Thirty-four respondents favored paymentsin generic commodity certificates and 2 opposed such payments. In orderto fully utilize the assets of CCC, it has been determined that 50 percentof the advanced deficiency payments will be paid in commodity certificates.Any additional certificate payments will be made as market conditions warrant.(g) <T3>Farmer-Owned Reserve (FOR):</T3> Eight respondents opposed entry intothe FOR and 5 favored such action. Because the required minimum reservelevels were lowered by the 1987 Act, it was announced that no immediateentry would be permited into the FOR. Actions to encourage participationin the program will be taken if reserve quantities fall below the requiredminimum level of 300 million bushels.(h) <T3>Wheat Export Certificate Program:</T3> Five respondents opposed theexport certificate program while 2 favored its implementation. This programwill not be implemented because the generic commodity certificate and exportenhancement programs were determined to be sufficient to provide incentivesfor the export of wheat from private and CCC-owned stocks.(i) <T3>Inventory Reduction Program (IRP):</T3> Four respondents favored theIRP and 1 respondent opposed its implementation. Implementation of theIRP is dependent upon implementation of a marketing loan program. Becausea marketing loan will not be implemented, the IRP will not be implemented.(j) <T3>Special Wheat Grazing and Hay Program: </T3>Three comments were receivedopposing this program. The special grazing and hay program will not beimplemented because it was determined that: (1) Additional haying and grazingsupplies will not be needed; (2) haying of additional program acreage willhave an adverse economic effect on the incomes of those producers who alreadygrow such crops; and (3) additional reductions in planted acreage is notnecessary to manage wheat supplies.Feed Grain CommentsA total of 115 respondents commented on the 1988 Feed Grain Program determinations.Eighty-seven of the respondents were individual producers and 10 were producerorganizations.With respect to the specific comments for the 1988 Feed Grains Programthe following are noted:(a) <T3>Acreage Limitation Program:</T3> Forty-eight comments were receivedregarding acreage reduction levels with 20 percent, the statutory maximumALP level, receiving the most comments at 27. Of the remaining 21 comments,5 favored a 12.5 percent ALP, 3 favored a 15 percent ALP, 10 favored unspecifiedALP levels, and 3 opposed the ALP. The maximum level was selected becausecorn stock levels on September 1, 1988, were projected to exceed 4 billionbushels, double the statutory target carryover level of 2 billion bushels.(b) <T3>Established ``Target'' Price: </T3>Eighteen respondents favored a targetprice level of $3.03 per bushel, the 1987 level, 10 favored $2.97 per bushel,and 12 favored non-specific raising or lowering of the target price. Thetarget price is set at the statutory minimum of $2.93 per bushel providedfor in the 1987 Act. This level is well above the projected U.S. averagevariable cash costs of production for the 1988-crop, thereby ensuring programparticipants an adequate safety net for farm income.(c) <T3>Loan and Purchase Level:</T3> Nine respondents favored setting theloan rate for corn at the 1987 level, 7 favored $2.17 per bushel and 9favored $1.74 per bushel, with 13 non-specific comments. The minimum statutoryloan level of $1.77 per bushel for corn was selected because: (1) Averagefarm prices during the preceding marketing year did not exceed 110 percentof the loan rate; (2) the action is necessary to maintain a competitivemarket position; and (3) the loan rate is well above the projected U.S.average variable cash cost of production for the 1988 crop.(d) <T3>Land Diversion Program:</T3> Thirty-one respondents favored a paiddiversion program and 7 opposed such a program. In accordance with the1987 Act, a voluntary paid diversion program of 10 percent for corn, sorghum,and barley is required to be implemented with respect to 1988 crops. Accordingly,such a program will be available to producers who also participate in theacreage reduction program.(e) <T3>Marketing Loan:</T3> Twelve respondents favored a marketing loan programand 8 opposed its implementation. A marketing loan will not be implementedbecause: (1) The loan rate was determined capable of maintaining competitivemarketing positions; and (2) implementation would have greatly increasedprogram costs with only a marginal increase in export demand.(f) <T3>Commodity Certificates:</T3> Thirty respondents favored payments ingeneric commodity certificates, 5 opposed the use of certificates, and2 favored a choice of receiving payments in cash or in certificates. Inorder to fully utilize the assets of CCC, it has been determined that 50percent of advanced deficiency payments and 100 percent of feed grain diversionpayments will be paid in commodity certificates. Any additional certificatepayments will be made as market conditions warrant.(g) <T3>Farmer-Owned Reserve:</T3> Thirteen respondents favored entry intothe FOR and 6 opposed such action. The quantity of corn in the FOR exceedsthe statutory maximum level, accordingly it was announced that no immediateentry would be permitted into the FOR. Actions to encourage participationin the program will be taken if reserve quantities fall below the requiredminimum level of 450 million bushels.(h) <T3>Feed Grain Export Certificate Program:</T3> Six respondents opposedthe export certificate program and 1 respondent favored its implementation.This program will not be implemented because the use of generic commoditycertificate and the export enhancement program were determined to be sufficientto provide incentives for the export of feed grains from private and CCC-ownedstocks.(i) <T3>Inventory Reduction Program:</T3> Four respondents opposed the IRPand 3 favored its implementation. Implementation of the IRP is dependentupon implementation of a marketing loan program. Because a marketing loanwill not be implemented, the IRP will not be implemented.(j) <T3>Eligibility of Barley: </T3>Five comments were received favoring theinclusion of barley in the feed grain program. Barley will be includedin the 1988 Feed Grain Program because instituting ALP requirements withrespect to the production of barley will help balance barley supply withdemand.(k) <T3>Exemption of Malting Barley:</T3> Three respondents opposed the exemptionof malting barley from an acreage limitation program and 2 favored suchaction. Malting barley producers will not be exempt from the ALP becausethe exclusion of such varieties from production adjustment requirementswould reduce the effectiveness of the feed grain program.(l) <T3>Nonrecourse Loan for Corn Silage:</T3> Eleven respondents favored theinclusion of corn silage grain equivalent in the loans and purchases programand 4 opposed such action. The program will not be made available becausethe cost of the program would significantly outweigh the benefits whichwould be received by producers.(m) Sixty-two comments were received that were either nonspecific or relatedto issues for which comments were not requested.Upland Cotton Program CommentsA total of 10 respondents commented on the 1988 Upland Cotton Program determinations.Two of the respondents were individual producers, 7 were producer organizations,and one represented an industry association.(a) <T3>Acreage Limitation Program:</T3> Five respondents favored an acreagereduction level of 10 percent or less and 3 favored an ALP of 15 percent.An ALP level of 12.5 percent was selected because it provided a total supplyof upland cotton adequate for domestic and export marketings and resultedin carryover stocks at approximately the statutory target level of 4 millionbales.(b) <T3>Established ``Target'' Price:</T3> Four comments were received supportingthe statutory minimum target price level. The target price is set at thestatutory minimum of $0.759 per pound provided for in the 1987 Act. Thislevel is well above the projected U.S. average variable cash costs of productionfor the 1988-crop, thereby ensuring program participants an adequate safetynet for farm income.(c) <T3>Loan Level: </T3>Five comments were received supporting the statutorilydetermined loan level. The loan level of $0.518 per pound was establishedbased on the statutory formula.(d) <T3>Land Diversion Program: </T3>Five respondents favored a paid diversionprogram and 1 opposed such a program. A paid diversion program will notbe implemented because the ALP level was determined to be sufficient toadequately manage stock levels.(e) <T3>Commodity Certificates: </T3>Seven respondents favored payments inthe form of generic commodity certificates and 1 respondent opposed suchpayments. In order to fully utilize the assets of CCC, it has been determinedthat 50 percent of advanced deficiency payments will be paid in commoditycertificates. Any additional certificate payments will be made as marketconditions warrant.(f) <T3>Inventory Reduction Program: </T3>One respondent favored the IRP and1 respondent opposed the implementation of such a program. The IRP willnot be implemented for cotton because: (1) Such a program would encourageproducers to plant nonprogram crops on available crop acreage thereby adverselyaffecting the incomes of current producers of such nonprogram crops; and(2) the program requires payments to be made in the form of cotton specificcertificates and CCC does not have a sufficient quantity of cotton inventorywhich could be exchanged for such certificates.(g) <T3>Plan A/Plan B and Loan Repayment Level: </T3>Four comments were receivedsupporting the Plan B repayment provision. Plan B was selected becauseof its flexibility in adapting to world price fluctuations, thereby minimizingGovernment cost exposure should prices rise above expected levels.(h) <T3>Loan Deficiency Payments: </T3>Five comments were received in supportof making loan deficiency payments available to producers. This provisionwill be implemented for upland cotton because offering loan deficiencypayments will provide greater marketing opportunities to producers andalso reduce the quantity of upland cotton pledged as collateral for CCCprice support loans.(i) <T3>National Program Acreage (NPA): </T3>Two comments were received opposingthe NPA provision. Since an ALP is in effect for the 1988 crop, the NPAdetermination is not applicable.(j) <T3>Voluntary Reduction Percentage (VRP): </T3>Two comments were receivedopposing the VRP provision. Since an ALP is in effect for the 1988 crop,the VRP will not be applicable.(k) <T3>Seed Cotton Loan Program: </T3>Five comments were received favoringcontinuation of seed cotton loans. Seed cotton loans will continue to beoffered to producers because it helps to provide producers interim financingbetween the time cotton is harvested and the time the cotton is ginned.(l) Thirty-one comments were received that were either nonspecific or relatedto issues for which comments were not requested.ELS Cotton Program CommentsOne respondent commented on the 1988 ELS Cotton Program determinations.The respondent was a producer organization that favored an acreage reductionlevel of 5 percent. An ALP level of 10 percent was selected because itprovided a total supply of ELS cotton adequate for domestic and exportmarketings and rsulted in carryover stocks at approximately the targetlevel of 65,000 bales.Rice Program CommentsA total of 43 respondents commented on the 1988 Rice Program determinations.Twenty-three of the respondents were individual producers and 10 were producerorganizations.With respect to the specific comments for the 1988 Rice Program the followingare noted:(a) <T3>Acreage Limitation Program: </T3>Forty comments were received regardingacreage reduction levels with 35 percent, the statutory maximum level,receiving the most comments at 20. Of the remaining 20 comments, 8 favoredan ALP level of 25 percent, 6 favored 20 percent, 3 favored 15 percent,and 1 each favored 10, 5, and 0 percent. An ALP level of 25 percent wasselected because it provided a total supply of rice adequate for domesticand export marketings and resulted in ending stocks at approximately thestatutory target level of 30 million cwt.(b) <T3>Established ``Target'' Price: </T3>Three respondents favored a targetprice level of $11.30 per cwt., the 1987 level, and 1 respondent favored$10.74 per cwt. The target price is set at the statutory minimum of $11.15per cwt. provided for in the 1987 Act. This level is well above the projectedU.S. average variable cash costs of production for the 1988-crop, therebyensuring program participants an adequate safety net for farm income.(c) <T3>Loan and Purchase Level: </T3>Three respondents favored a loan andpurchase rate of $6.50 per cwt., the statutory minimum at the time commentswere requested, and 1 respondent favored $6.84 per cwt. Subsequently, the1949 Act was amended to provide for a minimum price support level for the1988 crop of $6.63 per cwt. The statutory minimum was selected becauseit was determined to be well above the projected U.S. average variablecash cost of production for the 1988 crop.(d) <T3>Land Diversion Program: </T3>Two comments were received opposing apaid diversion program. A paid diversion program will not be implementedbecause the ALP level was determined to be sufficient to adequately managestock levels.(e) <T3>Commodity Certificates: </T3>Five respondents favored payments in theform of generic commodity certificates and 3 opposed the use of certificates.In order to fully utilize the assets of CCC, it has been determined that50 percent of advanced deficiency payments will be paid in commodity certificates.Any additional certificate payments will be made as market conditions warrant.(f) <T3>Inventory Reduction Programs: </T3>Two comments were received opposingthe IRP. The IRP will not be implemented for rice because such a programwould encourage producers to plant nonprogram crops on available crop acreage,thereby adversely affecting the incomes of current producers of such nonprogramcrops.(g) <T3>Loan Deficiency Payments: </T3>Three respondents favored making couldbe available to exchange for such certificates; loan deficiency paymentsand 1 respondent opposed such action. Loan deficiency payments will bemade available because: (1) Part of such payments must be made in the formof rice specific commodity certificates and CCC does not own sufficientquantities of rice which would be available for the exchange of such certificates;(2) these payments are based on program yields rather than harvested yieldsand, accordingly, producer participation in this provision would to benegligible; and (3) it has been determined that offering producers loandeficiency payments would not significantly reduce the quantities of ricepledged as collateral for CCC price support loans.(h) <T3>National Program Acreage: </T3>One comment was received opposing theNPA provision. Since an ALP is in effect for the 1988 crops, the NPA determinationis not be applicable.(i) <T3>Voluntary Reduction Percentage: </T3>Two comments were received opposingthe VRP provision. Since an ALP is in effect for the 1988 crops, the VRPis not applicable.(j) <T3>Loan Rate Adjustment: </T3>Seven comments were received regarding theclass loan rate differential. Four of the comments favored a differentialof $1.00 per cwt., which was the 1987 level. One comment each was receivedsupporting a differential of $4.00, $2.00, and $0.00 per cwt. The loanrate differential was established at $1.00 per cwt. because this levelmost accurately represents the domestic class loan rates which reflectthe ratio of class world prices.(k) <T3>Purchase of Marketing Certificates: </T3>Two respondents opposed thisprovision and 1 respondent favored its implementation. Producers will notbe required to purchase marketing certificates as a condition of repayinga loan at a reduced rate because such certificates must be exchanged forCCC-owned rice and CCC does not have sufficient quantity of rice in itsinventory which could be exchanged for such certificates.(l) <T3>Marketing Certificates: </T3>Three comments were received in favorof the marketing certificate program. CCC will continue to issue genericcommodity certificates to producers whenever the world price for a classof rice (adjusted to U.S. qualities and location) is below the minimumloan repayment level. This action is considered necessary to make U.S.rice competitive in world markets and to maintain and expand exports ofrice produced in the U.S.(m) Twenty-eight comments were received that were either nonspecific orrelated to issues for which comments were not requested.This notice affirms the following determinations previously made and announcedby the Secretary, beginning July 2, 1987, with respect to the 1988 cropsof wheat, feed grains, rice and cotton (upland and ELS).<ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations</ITAG>1. Loan and Purchase LevelIn accordance with sections 107D(a)(1), 105C(a)(1), 101A(a)(1), 103A(a)(1),and 103(h)(2) of the 1949 Act, the price support loan and purchase levelper bushel, unless otherwise indicated, shall be $2.21 for wheat, $1.77for corn, $1.68 ($3.00 per cwt.) for sorghum, $1.44 for barley, $0.90 foroats, $1.50 for rye, $6.63 per cwt. for rice, $0.5180 per pound for uplandcotton, and $0.8092 per pound for ELS cotton.2. Established (Target) PriceIn accordance with sections 107D(b)(1)(G), 105C(b)(1)(E), 101A(c)(1)(D),103A(c)(1)(D) and 103(h)(3)(B) of the 1949 Act, the established (``target'')price per bushel, unless otherwise indicated, shall be $4.23 for wheat,$2.93 for corn, $2.78 ($4.96 per cwt.) for sorghum, $2.51 for barley, $1.55for oats, $11.15 per cwt. for rice, $0.759 per pound for upland cotton,and $0.957 per pound for ELS cotton.3. Acreage Reduction/Paid Land Diversion ProgramIn accordance with sections 107D(f)(1)(B), 105C(f)(1)(B), 103A(f)(2)(A)and 103(h)(8)(A) of the 1949 Act, acreage reduction programs have beenestablished with respect to the 1988 crops at 27\1/2\ percent for wheat,20 percent for corn, sorghum, and barley, 5 percent for oats, 25 percentfor rice, 12\1/2\ percent for upland cotton, and 10 percent for ELS cotton.Accordingly, producers will be required to reduce their 1988 acreages ofthese commodities for harvest from the respective crop acreage base establishedfor a farm by at least these established percentages for each commodityin order to be eligible for price support loans, purchases, and paymentsfor each such commodity. Producers of corn, sorghum, and barley are eligiblein accordance with section 105C(f)(5) of the 1949 Act to receive diversionpayments on an acreage equivalent to 10 percent of the corn, sorghum, andbarley crop acreage base established for the farm if the acreage plantedto these crops on the farm for harvest does not exceed 70 percent of suchcrop acreage base. The diversion payment rates per bushel shall be: $1.75for corn; $1.65 for sorghum, and $1.40 for barley.4. Set-Aside ProgramIn accordance with sections 107D(f)(1), and (3) and 105C(f) (1) and (3)of the 1949 Act, it has been determined that there will be no set-asideprogram for the 1988 crops of wheat and feed grains.5. Haying and Grazing/Production of Approved Nonprogram CropsIn accordance with sections 107D(c)(1), 107D(f)(4), 105C(c)(1), 105C(f)(4),103A(c)(1), 103A(f)(3), 101A(c)(1), and 101A(f)(3) of the 1949 Act, ithas been determined that haying will not be allowed except under emergencyconditions unless it is determined that, based upon information submittedby a State ASC committee, haying will not result in an adverse economiceffect in the State. Grazing of acreage designated as ACR and CU will bepermitted except during any 5-consecutive-month period between April 1and October 31 that is established for a State, by the State ASC committee.Haying and grazing of conservation reserve acreage is prohibited. The Secretaryhas further determined that production of crops, program or nonprogram,will not be permitted on ACR or CU acreage.6. Advance Deficiency and Land Diversion PaymentsIn accordance with section 107C of the 1949 Act the Secretary will makeavailable to producers: (1) Advance deficiency payments for the 1988 cropsof wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice; and (2) advance land diversionpayments for the 1988 crops of corn, sorghum, and barley. Producers mayrequest 40 percent of their projected deficiency payments when they enrollin the 1988 Wheat, Feed Grain, Upland Cotton and Rice Programs. Fifty percentof the advance deficiency payments will be paid in cash and the balanceof the advanced amount will be paid in generic commodity certificates.The entire diversion payment will be made in advance on or about May 16,1988. One hundred percent of the feed grain diversion payment will be paidin generic commodity certificates. No advance deficiency payments willbe offered to ELS cotton producers.7. Binding ContractsContracts signed by program participants will be considered binding atthe end of the signup period and will provide for liquidated damages ifproducers do not comply with contractual arrangements. It has been determinedthat binding contracts will ensure a high level of compliance by thoseproducers enrolling in the program and will also result in a more effectiveprogram.8. Cross and Offsetting ComplianceIn accordance with sections 107D(n)(2), 105C(n)(2), 103A(n)(2), and 101A(n)(2)of the 1949 Act, it has been determined that limited cross compliance willbe required as a condition of eligibility for program benefits for wheat,feed grains (excluding oats), rice and upland cotton. Section 103(h)(16)(c)prohibits imposition of limited cross compliance for the 1988 crop of ELScotton. In accordance with sections 107(d)(i), 105C(i), 103A(n)(1), and103(h)(13) of the 1949 Act, it has been determined that offsetting complianceby wheat, feed grain and ELS cotton Program participants will not be requiredas a condition of eligibility for program benefits. Sections 101A(n)(1)and 103A(n)(3) prohibit imposition of offsetting compliance for rice andupland cotton program participants.9. Establishment of Acreage Bases and AdjustmentsIn accordance with section 503 of the 1949 Act, farm acreage bases willbe established for the 1988 crop year. Adjustments in crop acreage basesfor the 1988 program as provided in section 505 will not be allowed. Inaccordance with section 504 of the 1949 Act, it has been determined thatlimited adjustments in crop acreage bases may be approved when producersneed to change cropping practices to carry out conservation compliancerequirements on highly erodible land.10. Establishment of Program Payment YieldsIn accordance with section 506 of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat the actual yield per harvested acre for the 1988 crop and subsequentcrop years of wheat, feed grains, rice and upland cotton will not be consideredin establishing subsequent year farm program payment yields.11. Marketing Loan<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Wheat and Feed Grains</ITAG>In accordance with sections 107D(a)(5) and 105(a)(4) of the 1949 Act, ithas been determined that marketing loans will not be implemented for the1988 crops of wheat or feed grains. The price support loan and purchaselevels applicable to such crops have been lowered to the maximum extentpossible and it has been determined that this action is sufficient to maintaina competitive market position. Also, the implementation of a marketingloan program for such crops would greatly increase program costs whileprogram benefits would be minimal.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Upland Cotton</ITAG>In accordance with section 103A(a)(5) of the 1949 Act, the Secretary determinedon October 29, 1987, that Plan B of the marketing loan program would beimplemented in the event that the prevailing world market price (adjustedto U.S. quality and location) for upland cotton falls below the uplandcotton price support loan rate. The loan repayment rate shall be equalto the lesser of the loan level or the adjusted world market price.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Rice</ITAG>In accordance with section 101A(a)(5) of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat a producer of 1988-crop rice may repay a price support loan for the1988 crop of rice at a level that is the lesser of: (1) The price supportloan level or; (2) the higher of (i) 60 percent of the rice price supportloan rate or (ii) the prevailing world market price for rice. It has beendetermined that a producer shall not be required to purchase a negotiablemarketing certificate as a condition of repaying the rice price supportloan at a lower level.12. Loan Deficiency PaymentsIn accordance with sections 107D(b), 105C(b), 101A(b), and 103A(b) of the1949 Act, it has been determined that, with respect to the 1988 price supportand production adjustment programs, loan deficiency payments will not beavailable for wheat, feed grains, and rice, but will be available for uplandcotton. It has been determined that offering producers loan deficiencypayments in lieu of obtaining a price support loan will reduce the quantityof upland cotton pledged as collateral for price support loans when a marketingloan is in effect, but would not significantly reduce such quantities ofrice pledged as collateral. Since, for the 1988 crops, marketing loansare available only with respect to upland cotton and rice, loan deficiencypayments will not be available for feed grains and wheat producers.13. Inventory ReductionIn accordance with sections 107D(g), 105C(g), 101A(g), and 103A(g) of the1949 Act, it has been determined that the inventory reduction program willnot be implemented for the 1988 crops of wheat, feed grains, rice, andupland cotton since such a program would encourage producers to plant nonprogramcrops on available crop acreage and thereby adversely affect producersof such nonprogram crops.14. Advance Recourse Commodity LoansIn accordance with section 424 of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat advance recourse price support loans shall not be made available toproducers since advance deficiency payments for wheat, feed grains, riceand cotton and advance diversion payments for feed grains (except oats)will substantially augment private lending to producers and, therefore,ease producer credit problems. Further, implementing this program couldencourage producers to place additional encumbrances upon crops yet tobe produced which could result in increased financial stress for producersafter harvest.15. Farmer-Owned Reserve ProgramIn accordance with section 110 of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat there will be no immediate entry into the farmer-owned reserve (FOR)program for the 1988 crop of wheat and feed grains. The lower limit onthe size of the reserve for wheat and feed grains is established at 300million bushels and 450 million bushels, respectively. Actions to encourageparticipation in the program will be taken if reserve quantities fall belowthe minimum levels.16. Inclusion of BarleyIn accordance with section 105(c)(1)(F) of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat barley producers are eligible to receive 1988 feed grains programpayments since inclusion of barley in the feed grain acreage reductionprogram permits the alignment of barley stocks with barley demand.17. Exemption of Malting BarleyIn accordance with section 105C(e)(2) of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat malting barley shall not be exempt from the feed grain acreage reductionprogram since a large portion of barley production is planted to maltingbarley varieties and exclusion of such varieties from any production adjustmentrequirements would greatly reduce the effectiveness of the feed grain program.<T3>18. Nonrecourse Loans and Purchases for Corn Silage Grain Equivalent</T3>In accordance with section 105C(a) of the 1949 Act, it has been determinedthat corn silage grain equivalent will not be eligible for nonrecourseloans and purchases since an increase in program costs would result inonly marginal increases in program benefits.19. ELS and Upland Seed Cotton LoanIn accordance with section 103(h)(17) of the 1949 Act and section 5 ofthe Charter Act, it has been determined that recourse loans will be madeavailable to producers for ELS and upland seed cotton under the same provisionsthat were applicable to the 1987 crops of ELS and upland cotton.20. Cost Reduction OptionsIn accordance with section 1009 of the 1985 Act it has been determinedthat the Secretary will reserve the right to initiate cost reduction optionsif subsequent changes occur in supply and demand conditions.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Secs. 4 and 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation CharterAct, as amended, 62 Stat. 1070, as amended, 1072 (7 U.S.C. 714b and 714c);secs. 101, 101A, 103A, 103(h), 105B, 107C, 107D, 107E, 109, 110, 401, 424,504, and 505 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, 63 Stat. 1051,as amended, 99 Stat. 1419, as amended, 1407, as amended, 1395, as amended,1446, 1383, as amended, 1448, 91 Stat. 950, as amended, 951, as amended63 Stat. 1054, as amended, 99 Stat. 1461, as amended, 1462 (7 U.S.C. 1433c,1441, 1441-1, 1444-1, 1444-b, 1445b-2, 1445b-3, 1445b-4, 1445d, 1445e,1421, 1464 and 1465); sec. 1009 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended,49 Stat. 1453, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1308a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, on May 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Milton Hertz, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-10940 Filed 5-16-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-05-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
