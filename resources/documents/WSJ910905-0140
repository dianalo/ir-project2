The other used lavish banquets and politeformalities. But showmanship appeared to be the only commonground in an encounter between China's fearsome securityapparatus and the U.S. Congress's most fierce critics ofChina.   Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), Ben Jones (D., Ga.) andJohn Miller (R., Wash.) arrived Monday with hopes of gettinginto Beijing Prison No. 2 to see two political prisoners whoare on a hunger strike, Wang Juntao, 33 years old, and ChenZiming, 39.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, the three members of the House of Representativessaid they were treated to endless banquets and polite,inconclusive meetings with senior members of China's internalsecurity system, including China's top cop, Tao Siju, theminister of public security.   So the trio capped their tour yesterday afternoon bysummoning American television crews to the middle ofTiananmen Square, where they unveiled the first politicalbanner to appear there since Chinese troops killedpro-democracy demonstrators on June 4, 1989.   The small black-cloth banner, with white letters inChinese and English, read: &quot;To those who died for democracyin China.&quot; While unfurling the banner, the group placed threeflowers at the foot of a monument that once served asheadquarters for Tiananmen demonstrators.   The action led to an encounter with the lower echelon ofChina's security forces. Some members of the ABC, CBS and CNNtelevision crews were punched and pushed by undercover policewho temporarily confiscated their video tapes.   Other police tried to detain the lawmakers, who ignoredtheir entreaties and walked off the square. At one point, ayoung policeman with a truncheon ran after the lawmakers. Butsenior undercover agents intervened and ordered the man andhis colleagues to back off. The incident ended quietly.   Later, Rep. Miller said the lawmakers' gesture was partlyinspired by their formal talks with Chinese officials. &quot;Inmeeting after meeting, they told us that there is freedom ofspeech and political thought in China,&quot; Mr. Miller said. &quot;Sowe believed that this gesture would be legal.&quot;   The skirmish notwithstanding, China apparently has decidedto allow human rights advocates to come to China andcomplain. To Beijing, this in itself is a major concession.   China also appears willing to occasionally releaseindividual prisoners. British diplomats say that ChinesePremier Li Peng told visiting British Prime Minister JohnMajor this week that jailed Hong Kong businessman Luo Haixingwould be released on medical grounds. Mr. Luo was jailed forattempting to help democracy activists Chen and Wang in theirfailed attempt to escape from China after the Tiananmenincident.   But members of Congress and human rights groups say theywon't be satisfied unless China takes a significant actionsuch as amnesty for all political prisoners. Rep. Pelosi ischief sponsor of legislation to attach strict human rightsconditions to China's most-favored-nation trading status,which gives China favorable tariff treatment. The Houseoverwhelmingly passed her legislation and the Senate approveda similar measure.   President Bush has promised to veto the bill. But Rep.Pelosi says that with the collapse of communism in the SovietUnion, she and her allies may be closer to rounding up the 67votes needed in the Senate to override a veto. She said shebelieves that unless China makes significant human rightsimprovements in the next year, Beijing could well lose MFNstatus.   &quot;Next year is an election year and who is going to go homeand defend the Chinese regime, including the president of theUnited States,&quot; Rep. Pelosi said.   If MFN status were lost, China's economy would be badlyshaken. Chinese exports to the U.S. this year are expected tosurpass $20 billion, about 35% of its total exports.Additionally, if Chinese products can't get preferential U.S.tariffs, foreign investment in China would be expected tonosedive.   But China seems to have no plans to make the sort of grandhuman rights gesture that Congress seeks. In recent months,Chinese government spokesmen have begun rebutting foreigncomplaints about human rights abuses in China by saying thatin a poor country like China, the right to be fed and clothedis all the human rights the country can handle.</TEXT></DOC>
