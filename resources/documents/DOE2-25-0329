The agent is based on a mixture of non-ionogenicand chelating detergents according to a Czechoslovak patent. The contentof softeners is reduced. The agent does not contain fillers which areuseless and only increase the volume of solidified liquid waste. Theagent is marketed as ALFA-DEO. The comparison was made with the previouslyused laundry and decontamination agents. The sorption-precipitation andprecipitation processes are described and the results of semi-pilot andpilot plant experiments are given. These experiments revealed that efficiencyof both processes is approximately equal. In both cases 90 to 95% ofinitially present radionuclides and all phosphates were removed whereasthe content of detergents in the treated water corresponded to 1 to 3mg laurylsulfonate per liter. Under specific dosing conditions ALPHA-DEOcan also be used in laundries where wastes are treated by precipitation.(J.B.). 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
