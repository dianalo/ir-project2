This is especiallytrue of the hotter resources. EPRI has conducted a research program forseveral years with the objective of determining the feasibility of reducinggeothermal power plant outage rates by 50% through the use of systematicscale control measures. The flash crystallizer concept is one candidatescale control technique. A pilot scale test facility was designed anda crystallizer specification was developed. The test facility was designedto be 1/100th of the size of a commercial unit. It was also designedto accommodate brines from a variety of geothermal sites. This paperdescribes the crystallizer test facility and proposed field tests. 3references, 5 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
