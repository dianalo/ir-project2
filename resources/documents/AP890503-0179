TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel's army on Wednesday unveiled anew tank that the inventor says will ``remain forever young''because of a unique armor system that can be replaced, even on thebattlefield.   Army commanders said the thick-skinned Merkava Mark 3 cansurvive anything an enemy infantryman can throw at it, making thetank one of the toughest in the world. Merkava means ``chariot'' inHebrew.   ``This is the most protected tank against known anti-tankweaponry,'' Brig. Gen. Yossi Ben Hanan, head of the armored corps,told reporters during a visit to the production line at a militarybase near Tel Aviv.   ``The Mark 3 is a step ahead of any tank deployed in the MiddleEast now,'' he said, adding it was on a par with the new SovietT-80 and the U.S. M-1A1.   Israel Tal, a retired major generalwho developed the tank and isnow a Defense Ministry adviser, said the revolutionary change inthe tank was the construction of modular units and bolt-on armorthat can be removed to make way for improvements.   This means the tank can get periodic facelifts to keep its skinas tough as possible. This is especially important at a time whenarmor technology is rapidly changing, he said.   ``This tank will remain forever young. It will never be old. Thearmor can be changed at any time, even in the field,'' said Tal,who led the armored column that seized the Suez Canal from Egypt inthe 1967 Middle East war.   In addition to the replaceable armor, some parts of the vehiclesuch as the fireproof fuel tanks in the rear are modular units thatcan be changed if upgraded parts are developed.   The army screened a film of the low-slung tank tearing acrossthe rocky terrain of northern Israel, making about a 40-foot leapthrough the air from an earthen embankment while going full tilt.   The Mark 3's top speed was not disclosed but it has a U.S.-made1200 horsepower engine. It also has a larger gun, 120mm instead ofthe 105mm cannon on earlier models.   In chemical, nuclear or biological warfare, the tank can besealed shut and the crew can operate in an air-conditionedenvironment without gas masks or cumbersome suits, Tal said. Theatmosphere in the cabin is ``over-pressured'' so that air leaks outrather than poison seeping inside, he said.   Other unique features of the Merkava include a back door thatallows the tank to unload an infantry squad during a battle and afront-mounted engine which doubles as additional armor to protectthe crew.   The new tank costs $2.3 million per unit to develop compared to$1.8 million for the Mark 1, first introduced in 1979 andbattle-tested against Syria's Soviet-made T-62 tanks in the 1982Lebanon War.   Tal said the advent of the Mark 3 means Israel now is in aposition to sell its Mark 1 and 2 tanks to foreign countries. Healso said special features of the tank, such as the bolt-on armor,could be sold separately to uprgrade existing tanks and otherarmored vehicles.   Despite some contentions that tanks are no longer the dominantforce in land battles, Tal contends they will remain a key elementof warfare.   ``Tanks are considered by both East and West as the backbone ofwarfare on land. This didn't change yet and the assumption is thatit won't change until the end of the century,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
