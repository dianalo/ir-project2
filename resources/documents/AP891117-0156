WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The new East German premier said Friday hiscountry is open to private enterprise and foreign investment tomeet the needs of frustrated consumers, but warned of hard economictimes ahead.   In his first speech to the East German parliament as head of thegovernment, Hans Modrow recommended greater cooperation witheconomically powerful West Germany while rejecting reunification.   The official news agency ADN released a letter from PresidentBush telling the new leadership the United States is interested incloser relations.   By Friday night, about 1.2 million East Germans had entered allof West Germany, including West Berlin, presaging a second wildweekend of shopping and sightseeing since East Germany opened itsborders Nov. 9.   Although East Germany's economy inspires envy in the Sovietbloc, Communist Party chief Egon Krenz and his new leadership havemade clear that debts and a dwindling labor force will prevent itfrom catching the West anytime soon.   More than 200,000 East Germans, nearly 1{ percent of thepopulation, have moved to West Germany the past several months.Most are young, skilled workers vital to the country's industry.   Modrow sketched a blueprint for economic recovery that mixes afew free-market principles into the state plan for the nation of16.5 million.   He said talk of reunification was ``dangerous and unrealistic,''and instead directed attention toward a course of reform similar tothat set for the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Gorbachev's model aims at social renewal through democraticfreedoms of speech, assembly and the press, and at allowing workersto produce goods or provide services privately in their free time.   East German economists have rejected the more market-orientedreforms embraced by Poland and Hungary, whose economies are in farworse condition.   Predicting hard times ahead, Modrow said continued budgetdeficits will be necessary and the government must bring pricesinto line with production costs, which will be hard on the nation'sdisproportionate number of pensioners.   He blamed the current deficits on ``squandering of state moneyand excessive administrative outlays.''   Modrow also revealed his proposed Cabinet at the beginning of atwo-day session of Parliament. Eleven of the 28 places were givento non-Communists, members of four small political groups alliedwith the party.   The 44-member cabinet forced out Nov. 7 had only four membersfrom the allied parties, which were formed to create a semblance ofopen government and have become more independent since thepro-democracy movement began.   East Germany is ``open for proposals on joint ventures,investment, transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects,''Modrow said, all of which address concerns of Western businessleaders interested in the East German market.   He said the government ``sees as its most urgent responsibilitythe stabilization of the economy.''   Talking with journalists after the session, Modroww urged EastGermans not to trade their non-convertible marks on the blackmarket in order to buy goods in West Germany. He conceded one WestGerman mark costs 20 East German on the black market, although theofficial rate set by East Germany is 1-for-1.   Relations with West Germany should be strengthened by agreementsdealing with security, cooperation, environmental protection andother matters of common interest, Modrow said in his parliamentspeech.   ``By means of a new reality of life in the German DemocraticRepublic (East Germany), the dangerous and unrealistic talk of areunification will be clearly rejected,'' he said to long applause.   Bonn's reaction to agreements was wary. West Germany does notrecognize the nation's division and Volker Ruehe of the ChristianDemocrats, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's political party, said signingtreaties could be tantamount to such recognition.   Modrow and Krenz are fighting time to improve the economy andstem the tide of emigration, and also face increasing demands forfree elections.   Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal Democrats, one of the fourparties allied with the Communists, is a leading voice for freeelections.   Gerlach, whose party has three ministries in Modrow's Cabinet,told the 500-member parliament the Liberal Democrats no longerwould run their candidates in a bloc with the Communists and calledfor ``true sharing of power'' in free choice by the voters.   His proposal for free elections and new legislation on votingand campaign procedures did not address the question of recognizingNew Forum and other pro-democracy groups that have agitated for arole in government.   Earlier this week, Gerlach said he would ask the parliament toremove the constitutional provision of a ``leading role'' for theCommunist Party that guarantees its supremacy. He did not mentionit in his speech Friday, but the session still has a day to run.</TEXT></DOC>
