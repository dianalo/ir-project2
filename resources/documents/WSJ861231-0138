As a demographer, however, I found one point misleading: &quot;. . . the number of old people -- particularly those 85 and over -- started its dramatic growth fairly recently, the result of decreased smoking and other life-style changes as well as new medical technology and treatment.&quot;    What is quoted here is true, but it gives one the impression that this is the primary reason for growth in the number of elderly. Yet this statement accounts for only one component of population change out of three: deaths (in this case, their decrease), births, and net migration.    If one examines the original infant cohorts that make up today's elderly in the U.S., one finds steadily and rapidly increasing numbers around the turn of the century.    So the number of elderly is increasing today because the birth cohorts were increasing 65 to 85 years ago. In addition, if one &quot;ages&quot; these infant cohorts and examines them in the 1930 U.S. Census, one discovers that in some cases their numbers had swelled. This means that results of net (in)migration were greater than the force of mortality over those years. Therefore, it is misleading to suggest that science and health are the main reasons for our increase in the number of elderly.
