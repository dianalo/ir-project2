The Commerce Department said that retail sales rose a seasonallyadjusted $714 million to $127.99 billion last month.   While the February increase was generally in line withexpectations, the government revised the January report to show asmall decline of 0.2 percent, instead of an originally reportedincrease of 0.5 percent.   Even with the January decline, analysts said the retail salesreport generally reflected that the October stock market crash hashad little effect on consumer buying plans.   Ever since the record 508-point drop in stock prices whichoccurred on Oct. 19, economists have been closely watching to seewhether the consumer sector would weaken.   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overalleconomic activity, any significant faltering in this area couldtopple the country into a recession.   Continued strong gains in employment growth have apparentlycalmed initial jitters over the stock market. Many economists haverecently revised up their growth forecasts for 1988.   The February report said that retail sales rose to the highestmonthly total since August 1987.   Much of the strength came from a 1.6 percent rise in auto sales,which followed an even stronger 2 percent increase in new car salesin January.   Without the gain in autos, which accounted for almost one-fourthof total sales last month, retail sales would have risen a smaller0.3 percent in February.   The important general merchandise category, which includesdepartment store sales, suffered a 1.6 percent decline in sales inFebruary following a small 0.1 percent drop in January sales.   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last three or moreyears, were up 1.6 percent in February while sales of non-durablegoods edged down 0.1 percent.   In the durable goods category, sales at building materials andhardware stores jumped a sharp 2.3 percent.   Sales at furniture and appliance stores were up 0.3 percent inFebruary following an even stronger 2.7 percent January increase.   Sales at specialty clothing stores climbed 0.6 percent inFebruary, only a partial rebound following a giant 3.3 percentJanuary decline.   Sales at gasoline stations fell 1.6 percent in February whilesales at restaurants edged up 0.1 percent and sales at drug storesposted a 0.6 percent increase.   Sales at grocery stores enjoyed a 0.7 percent rise in sales inFebruary, reversing a 0.6 percent January decline.</TEXT></DOC>
