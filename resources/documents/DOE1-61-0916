Soviet politicaland military leaders emphasize the connection between war and politics.Questions about the resort to war, conduct of war and war terminationhave both political and military components. The Soviets do not articulatescenarios of defeat or surrender. Their writers expect that a generalwar or most major wars will be coalition wars. During nuclear war afterthe initial exchange of strikes, the role of diplomacy will increase.One of the tasks of intrawar diplomacy will be to weaken the adversarycoalition. Soviet thinking about war and Soviet military doctrine underwentsignificant transitions from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. In the late1960s, Soviet military doctrine shifted to a recognition of U.S.-Sovietstrategic parity, with various implications for war and diplomacy. Itmight be in the interest of both superpowers to avert the disaster ofgeneral nuclear war, according to the revised Soviet formulations. Morescenarios below the level of general nuclear war received emphasis fromSoviet writers. Soviet recognition that &quot;flexible response&quot; was a possibleNATO (and Warsaw Pact) strategy led to their increased acceptance oflimited war. Soviet interest in limiting wars to the uses of conventionalweapons also grew. Development of Soviet military doctrine and forcestructure from the late 1960s into the 1980s has been designed to provideoptions for limiting war. Nonetheless, the Soviets recognize that thechoice of limiting war to conventional or less than general nuclear thresholdsmight not be theirs. They have even acknowledged the possibility thatwar between superpowers could cause changes in Soviet objectives afterwar began.</TEXT></DOC>
