<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0219 </DOCNO><TEXT>The USDOE initiated the Production Risk Evaluation Program (PREP) at SandiaNational Laboratories (SNL) to assess quantitatively the potential forserious production disruption as the result of random failures, accidents,natural disasters, or sabotage at its facilities. SNL developed a procedureincorporating both network and fault tree models that identifies productionvulnerabilities. For each production step, a steady-state flow modelcomputes the ``critical time,'' which is the maximum period a step canbe shut down without preventing the system from achieving productiongoals. The critical time is then used in fault tree analysis to determinethe failure modes that can stop the process for longer than this period.Modular logic modeling is used for constructing the fault trees. Equipmentrestorable within its critical time need not be considered critical eventhough it may perform significant work. The PREP models can be used toidentify those plant areas to which a saboteur would need to gain access.A security strategy using graded protection based on a PREP analysispotentially could reduce security costs. PREP methods also provide quantitativeinsights to develop protection measures that do not infringe upon theliberties of personnel or complicate work practices. 2 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
