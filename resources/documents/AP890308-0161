Olsen, a professoremeritus of veterinary pathobiology at Ohio State University.``Whether it would work for AIDS, I'd be very skeptical.''   However, one well-known AIDS researcher said he thought themonkey vaccine could be quite valuable in developing an AIDS vaccine.   Olsen and Ohio State graduate students last week announcedpreliminary success with a vaccine to immunize monkeys against theHTLV-1 virus. The vaccine uses an approach similar to that of avaccine Olsen developed several years ago, which veterinarians nowuse to protect millions of house cats from a deadly disease.   That illness, called feline leukemia; the HTLV-1 virus, whichcauses adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma; and the virus that causesAIDS all belong to the retrovirus family. Unlike other viruses,retroviruses become part of a chromosome, which carries geneticinformation.   The AIDS virus has other characteristics in common with HTLV-1.Both can be transmitted through blood, sexual intercourse andcontaminated needles, and HTLV-1 causes AIDS-like symptoms inmonkeys.   Some of the eight or so macaque monkeys vaccinated by Olsen'sgroup and then exposed to HTLV-1 have gone as long as two yearswithout their blood cells showing any signs of infection, Olsen said.   All five or six monkeys in a control group that were exposed tothe virus without being vaccinated eventually developed the illness,he said.   Olsen said his research during the next two years will attempt toprove the vaccine can prevent the virus from getting into achromosome and lying dormant.   ``You're in essence dealing with an agent that's adding newgenetic material to the host chromosome,'' Olsen said.   The vaccine does not contain the virus, just ``pieces and parts''of proteins that make up the virus, Olsen said.   Dr. Danny Bolognesi, a virologist and professor of experimentalsurgery at Duke University, said he was not familiar with Olsen'swork but that a vaccine against HTLV-1 virus would be significant interms of AIDS research.   ``Any vaccine against any member of the retrovirus family is ofenormous value,'' Bolognesi said.   Asked about the adaptability of a vaccine from monkeys to humans,Bolognesi said, ``That's pretty close. It's a good model. I wouldsay the transition to man ... would not be too difficult.''   Olsen said Ohio State researchers are in their fourth year ofresearch on the HTLV-1 vaccine. Ohio State plans to open a Centerfor Retrovirus Research next month, using university money androyalties from the cat vaccine, but Olsen said his group would nottry to work with the more volatile AIDS virus for at least a coupleof years.   ``We're going to finish what we've got, do well with what we'vegot, before jumping into other things,'' he said.   ``The AIDS virus changes very rapidly,'' he said. ``The HTLV-1virus is far more stable genetically.''   He explained that drawing blood from 10 people and growing theHTLV-1 virus in tissue cultures would result in little or nodifference in the virus from person to person. Doing the same thingwith the AIDS virus would produce different results from person toperson, Olsen said.   ``That's what's going to make the (AIDS) vaccine thing verydifficult,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
