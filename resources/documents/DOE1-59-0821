The sharp increasein electricity consumption follows three years of slack demand due tocivil disturbances before the end of the Macros administration and theelection of Corazon Aquino as President in 1986. Originally, the Aquinogovernment's medium term power development plans called for about 500MWof generating capacity to be installed between 1986 and 1992. The threeproposed plants were scheduled for commissioning in 1991 and 1992. However,a spurt in power demand growth during the past nine months has causedconcern among industrialists that power shortages could occur by theend of the decade. So additional capacity will be installed to preventan anticipated shortfall in electricity supplies by the early 1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
