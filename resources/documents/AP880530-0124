Gorbachev edgedforward on arms issues Monday in a summit session that was eclipsedby Reagan's meeting with dissidents and his challenge that theSoviet leader usher in ``a new age of religious freedom.''   ``It's time my friend, it's time,'' the president implored thegeneral secretary, quoting the pre-revolutionary Russian poetAlexander Pushkin as he sounded the human rights theme on thesecond day of his five-day visit.   In an extraordinary meeting with several dozen dissidents andrefuseniks and members of their families arrayed before him at theU.S. ambassador's residence, Reagan said: ``I came here hoping todo what I could to give you strength.''   ``But I already know it is you who have strengthened me. Youhave given me a message to carry back: While we press for humanrights through diplomatic channels, you press with your very lives,day in, day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes,your all.''   He said the United States ``views human rights as fundamental,absolutely fundamental, to our relations with the Soviet Union andall nations.''   The symbolism of Reagan's meetings spoke volumes. That he wasstepping into domestic matters on Soviet soil had rankled Gorbachevaides before and after the events, and the general secretaryreferred to it as he toasted Reagan at a state dinner.   Gorbachev called for closer contacts with Americans but said``this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs,without sermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, withoutturning family or personal problems into a pretext forconfrontation between states.''   Reagan told Gorbachev that he will tell the man who the Americanpeople elect this fall to succeed him that the search for commonground must continue.   ``Based on the achievements of the last few years, I will alsotell him it is a search that can succeed,'' the president said.   Gorbachev said the two leaders' main task is finding a way toreduce strategic nuclear weapons by 50 percent and noted the``tremendous importance'' of the recent agreement under which thesuperpowers will police the agreement for a Soviet pull out fromAfghanistan.   ``The whole world is watching,'' he said.   The summit session Monday focused on arms issues, and spokesmensaid the leaders were likely to sign agreements on two secondarypacts and were making progress on a far more significant strategicarms accord.   No one was predicting a breakthrough to conclude the so-calledSTART negotiations, but there was movement in two of the moststubborn areas _ involving mobile missiles and cruise missileslaunched from warplanes. However, the president's Strategic DefenseInitiative was still under Soviet challenge and the United Statesrefused to permit Soviet inspection of U.S. ships armed with cruisemissiles.   The arms discussions preceded the president's two human rightsevents.   Even before the first event _ Reagan's visit to the Danliovmonastery _ Gorbachev indicated his disagreement with Reagan'sappraisal of Soviet deficiencies. ``Both sides don't have a verygood idea of what the real situation in the Soviet Union and theUnited States (is),'' he said. Asked about the list of 14 casesturned over by Reagan at their first session on Sunday, the Sovietleader remarked, ``there are too many lists.''   Before the dissidents, the president praised the recent surge inJewish emigration and the release of 300 political prisoners in thethree years since Gorbachev took the Kremlin helm.   Afterward, Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, describedthe dissidents sourly as ``not the best of the Soviet people,rather the contrary.''   In the past, Gorbachev and other Soviet officials haveregistered irritation with American leaders lecturing them aboutinternal practices. But Reagan, clearly aware his words would ringaround the world, committed the United States to the freedommovement here.   ``It is our belief that this is a moment of hope,'' he said.   Gerasimov did not belabor the human rights issue. His briefingon the day's activities centered in large part on hopefuldevelopments in arms discussions. He said the leaders likely wouldwould execute two arms control agreements.   Neither approaches in importance the treaty to reduce long-rangenuclear weapons that continued to elude U.S. and Soviet negotiatorsmeeting in working groups off-stage. But both are in the``confidence-building'' category, and had been declaredunattainable by Reagan administration officials only two daysearlier.   One agreement provides for prior notification of missile tests.The other establishes the procedures for joint experiments withmonitoring equipment at the U.S. and Soviet nuclear test sites inNevada and at Semipalatinsk.   A senior U.S. official said the two pacts would be signedTuesday along with a new cultural agreement if they were completedby then.   Also, Gerasimov reported ``certain progress'' on monitoringcruise missiles carried by warplanes and said ``a compromise ispossible.'' At the same time, the Soviet official said the twosides had decided mobile missiles could be stored in designatedareas in order to keep track of the elusive weapons.   These are two of the main obstacles to a treaty to reducestrategic nuclear weapons arsenals by 30 to 50 percent.   However, Gerasimov said there was no agreement on monitoringwarships packed with cruise missiles. He blamed the United States,saying it wanted to protect a temporary edge.   ``We think this is not a serious approach at all,'' he said.   In a late-night briefing, a U.S. official who would not beidentified by name agreed there was headway between Reagan andGorbachev on air-launched cruise missiles, but he said ``it isstill an outstanding issue.''   On the mobile missiles, the U.S. official disagreed withGerasimov`s upbeat report. ``We haven`t heard a verification schemethat, we think, will work,'' he said. ``...That is an area ofsignificant difference between us.''   On sea-launched cruises, the U.S. official responded that ``wehave yet to see a verification regime which has been applied tosubmarines that we think is desirable.''   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater pointed outthere was ``significant disagreement'' on the size of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact ground forces inEurope.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
