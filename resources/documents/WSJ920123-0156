Not only are dividend yields significantly higher than the4% or so currently offered by bank certificates of depositand money-market mutual funds, &quot;but you also have thepotential of having dividend increases over time,&quot; says JamesR. Solloway, director of research at Argus Research Corp.,New York.</LP><TEXT>   The annual yield on the 15 stocks in the Dow Jones UtilityAverage is currently more than 6.5%. Add to that thepotential for dividend growth and a rise in the price of thestocks, and annual returns could easily hit 10% or 11%, saysRichard C. Young of Young Research andamp; Publishing Inc.,Newport, R.I. &quot;That ain't hay.&quot;   And unlike bonds, utility stocks act as a hedge againstinflation, rising in price as inflation accelerates. &quot;I wouldbe inclined to buy a public utility stock as an alternativeto buying 20- or 30-year bonds,&quot; says Gerald W. Perritt, anewsletter editor and portfolio manager of Perritt CapitalGrowth Fund in Chicago.   But Mr. Perritt, like other analysts and money managers,tempers his endorsement. Although yields are enticing anddividend-growth potential is attractive, they note that themarket has been pricey in recent months and interest ratesare nearing their bottom. &quot;And like bonds, when interestrates go up, prices go down,&quot; he says.   Moreover, utility stocks tend to underperform the marketwhen stocks are hot. Returns on utility mutual funds lastyear, for example, averaged 21.4%, compared with 30.66% forall equity funds, as measured by Lipper Analytical Services.   Utilities also don't respond strongly in an economicrecovery. Many big portfolio managers are moving their moneyout of utility stocks and into companies expected to prosperin an upturn. Their selling has pushed utility stock pricesdown about 6% since Jan. 1, after climbing 11% in the thirdquarter and 10% in the fourth quarter of 1991, says BarryAbramson, a utilities analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.in New York.   But for the individual investor looking for income ratherthan market play, utility stocks can still make sense,particularly if purchased with an eye toward growth,utility-stock specialists say. That means looking forwell-positioned companies in growth areas of the country andspotting those that are likely to increase their dividends.   Mr. Young, for example, likes Teco Energy, a Tampa, Fla.,utility that is now yielding only about 4.5%. But when youadd dividend growth of 6% to 6.5% and stock appreciation, hesays, total annual returns over the next three to five yearsshould average 11%.   Turnaround situations also offer growth possibilities,says Philip Dubuque, portfolio manager for the FinancialStrategic Utilities Portfolio in Denver. Companies that haveworked their way out of nuclear-power-construction problemsthat forced dividend cuts now offer real growthopportunities. Among the companies he likes: Illinois Power,General Public Utilities and Montana Power.   How do you tell a good utility stock from a loser?   Utility-stock specialists say investors should take a goodlong look at dividend rates, dividend history, payout ratioand the common equity ratio.   Today's high-quality utility companies are generallyyielding between 5.5% and 6.5%. While some good companies mayhave lower yields, leaving room for dividend growth, a higheryield can be a sign of pending trouble. &quot;I'm leery of thosepaying 8% or more,&quot; says Mr. Perritt. One company that makesthe experts nervous: Centerior Energy in Ohio, with an 8.6%yield.   The dividend history is also important, providing apicture of both a company's growth and stability. &quot;This isvital,&quot; says Mr. Young. Again, he cites Teco, which has paidannual dividends every year since 1900 and has increased itsdividend for each of the past 15 years.   The payout ratio shows how much of the company's profit ispaid out in dividends. If the ratio is high -- much above 85%-- there isn't much room for dividend growth. But if it islow -- 70% to 75% -- it means that the company iswell-positioned to boost its payout.   Likewise, common equity ratio can be important, showingthe proportion of capital that is common stock rather thanpreferred shares or debt. An average electric utility has aratio of between 40% and 45%, says Mr. Young. The higher theratio, the less debt and the more conservative the balancesheet. Companies with ratios of above 55% are rare, but onebelow 40% can be indicative of an overleveraged company withproblems.   Other factors? &quot;I would want to make sure that the utilityhas no lingering problems with construction of nuclearplants,&quot; says Mr. Solloway of Argus Research. &quot;And I want tobe in a utility where there isn't any problem with theregulatory commission with which it has to bargain for rateincreases.&quot;   Among the states generally deemed favorable to utilitiesare Florida, Indiana and Wisconsin. States with hostileregulators include Louisiana, Massachusetts, Arizona andIowa.   Investors can also take a look at whether the company willhave a hard time complying with Clean Air Act requirements,whether the primary fuel is natural gas or nuclear, and evenwhether changes in upper-air-flow patterns meanwarmer-than-normal winters.   People who don't want to do the homework on individualutility stocks can buy a portfolio of utility stocks througha mutual fund. Fidelity Investments, for example, offersthree. But check the fund's investing philosophy. Someemphasize growth, investing in lower-dividend companies,while others opt for higher yield.   Utility stocks aren't for everyone, but they can pay offfor patient investors who know what they're getting into.&quot;Utilities often play the game of the tortoise and the hare,&quot;says Mr. Abramson of Prudential Securities. &quot;The market jumpsahead, but utilities tend to catch up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
