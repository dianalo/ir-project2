Net income for the fourth quarter ended March 31 fell to $11 million, or 56 cents a share, from $12.3 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 21% to $293 million from $242.6 million.    The company said the latest earnings would be reduced if the management of its CWT trucking unit is successful in a leverage buyout of the subsidiary. Gerber said the buyout would result in a charge to earnings. The unit is in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis.    The maker of baby products said net for fiscal 1987 fell 20% to $36.4 million, or $1.81 a share, from $45.5 million, or $2.23 a share, in fiscal 1986. Sales rose 8.1% to $1 billion from $968 million. Year-ago net included a $4.2 million charge in connection with the closing of a baby-food plant in Oakland, Calif.    The company said sales improved as a result of the widespread acceptance of a new line of baby foods introduced in October.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gerber shares closed at $43, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
