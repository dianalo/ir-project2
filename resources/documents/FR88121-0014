Background</ITAG>Under section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act (the Act), enacted bythe Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-21) on April 20, 1983,the prospective payment system for Medicare payment of inpatient hospitalservices was established effective with hospital cost reporting periodsbeginning on or after October 1, 1983. Prior to implementation of the prospectivepayment system, all providers of health care services (for example, hospitals,skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies) were reimbursed basedon the lesser of the reasonable cost of services furnished to Medicarebeneficiaries or the provider's customary charges for those services.Since actual reasonable cost cannot be determined until the end of a provider'scost reporting period, an interim rate of payment, approximating actualcost as closely as possible, is determined by the intermediaries for eachprovider and interim payments are made on that basis during the year. Theseinterim payments are required by section 1815(a) of the Act, which statesthat we must pay providers at least monthly during the cost reporting period,pending a final determination of cost on the basis of a submitted costreport and any necessary adjustments. After receipt of the provider's costreport, the intermediary determines what the actual payment for the periodshould have been and a retroactive adjustment is made. The regulationsthat implement these policies are located at 42 CFR 413.64.There are two methods of interim payment for inpatient hospital servicesfor hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system. One methodis based on actual bills submitted by the hospital. Under this method,interim payments are calculated by applying a predetermined per diem amountto the number of Medicare patient days reflected on actual bills or byapplying a predetermined percentage to the charges reflected on the actualbills submitted. The predetermined per diem amount or percentage factorapplied to billed patient days or charges represents an estimate of thehospital's previous year's costs, adjusted to ensure that the current year'srate of payment is as close as possible to the current year's costs. Under the second method, referred to as the periodic interim payment (PIP)method, interim payments are not based on individual bills. Instead, paymentis based on the estimated annual costs attributable to estimated Medicareutilization of a hospital, and equal biweekly payments are made to hospitalswithout regard to the submission of individual bills. PIP has been availablefor inpatient hospital services since 1968. It was offered to qualifiedhospitals as an alternative to regular interim reimbursement, which requiressubmission of a bill to receive payment. With either of these interim payment methods, any overestimation or underestimationof the hospital's actual costs, to the extent not adjusted during the year,is adjusted at the time of cost report settlement.Under the prospective payment system, hospitals are paid, for most of thePart A inpatient services they furnish, a prospectively determined amountfor each discharge based on actual bills submitted. This amount constitutesfinal payment for each discharge claimed. Although no form of interim paymentis necessary for hospitals operating under the prospective payment system,we extended the option to these hospitals to elect to receive PIP whenthe prospective payment system was implemented in order to avoid cash flowproblems in the early stages of the system. Thus, prospective payment hospitalsthat met the qualifications for receiving PIP could elect to receive thistype of interim payment, which would be based on their estimated annualprospective payment amounts. The PIP payment is made two weeks after theend of a biweekly period of services. In these circumstances, year-endreconciliation is required. Payment for capital-related costs and those direct medical education coststhat are payable to prospective payment hospitals on a reasonable costbasis is made on an interim payment basis pending a year-end reconciliationbased on a cost report. These interim payments are determined by estimatingthe reimbursable amount for the year based on the previous year's experienceand on information for the current year and dividing that amount into 29equal payments made biweekly. In addition, the indirect teaching adjustment,if appropriate, is paid on a biweekly interim basis subject to final settlement.These payments are not considered as part of the PIP method of paymentand are not affected by this rule. These payments will continue to be madeon a biweekly basis. Although the PIP method of interim payment is not based on actual billssubmitted, a PIP hospital must continue to submit bills for subsequentintermediary verification of the accuracy of the rate. The rate is reviewedat least twice per year for hospitals paid under the prospective paymentsystem and at least quarterly for hospitals reimbursed on a reasonablecost basis. If necessary, as determined by the reviews, the rate is adjusted.Interim payments may be further adjusted based on cumulative payment datafor the year. In August 15, 1986, we published a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 29386) concerning interim payments. Inthat rule, we took the following actions, which were to be effective onJuly 1, 1987:andbullet; We eliminated PIP as an optional method of payment for inpatienthospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, except for servicesfurnished by rural hospital with fewer than 100 beds (See andSection;andSection;413.64(h)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(i) and (ii).) andbullet; In order to alleviate the cash flow problems that certain hospitalsencounter, we provided for one interim payment to hospitals subject tothe prospective payment system for each case in which a patient remainsin the hospital more than 30 covered days. (See andSection; 413.64(k)(5).)Under this provision any interim payment made was to be applied againstthe final payment made for the discharge. andbullet; We also eliminated PIP for hospitals receiving payment under ademonstration project authorized by section 402(a) of the Social SecurityAmendments of 1967 (Pub. L. 90-248) or section 222(a) of the Social SecurityAmendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-603), and for those hospitals paid underState reimbursement control systems authorized by section 1886(c) of theAct and approved by HCFA. However, under this provision, these hospitalswere to be permitted to use a form of interim payment similar to PIP ifthat type of payment is specifically approved by HCFA as a part of thedemonstration or control system. (See andSection; 413.64(h)(1)(ii)(C).) andbullet; We provided that payment for direct medical education and otherinpatient hospital costs excluded from the prospective payment system wasto continue to be made biweekly on an interim payment basis. We amendedandSection;andSection; 405.454(j) and (m) to make these changes. These sections were subsequently redesignated as andSection;andSection; 413.64(h)and (k) respectively in a final rule with comment period published on September30, 1986 (51 FR 34790). We issued the August 15, 1986 final rule because evidence indicated thatthe PIP method had increasingly become a burden for the intermediariesand that it resulted in the expenditures of considerable resources in attemptingto identify and correct overpayments and underpayments. We stated thateliminating PIP for all hospitals (that is, those paid on the basis ofreasonable costs and those subject to prospective payment) would allowintermediate to utilize their resources more effectively to better controlpayments to hospitals and all other providers. Furthermore, we stated thatthe elimination of PIP would encourage hospitals to submit their billson a more timely basis since hospitals receiving PIP have less incentiveto bill timely than hospitals not receiving PIP. On October 21, 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-509) was enacted. Section 9311(a) of Pub. L. 99-509 added a new paragraph(e) to section 1815 of the Act that provides for the following_andbullet; Payment must be made available for inpatient hospital servicesfurnished by a prospective payment hospital, including distinct part psychiatricor rehabilitation units, on a PIP basis (rather than on the basis of billsactually submitted) in the following cases:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The hospital's fiscal intermediary fails to meet the requirementsof section 1816(c)(2) of the Act concerning the prompt payment of claimsfor three consecutive calendar months (see discussion below), the hospitalrequests payment on a PIP basis, and the hospital meets the requirementsapplicable to payment on a PIP basis that were in effect as of October1, 1986.

Changes to the Regulations Governing PIP</ITAG>In effect, except for the provision dealing with one interim payment toprospective payment hospitals experiencing unusually long lengths of stay(discussed below), section 9311 of Pub. L. 99-509 overrides the August15, 1986 final rule and requires the publication of revised regulations.Our implementation of section 9311(a) of Pub. L. 99-509 is discussed indetail below.A. Payment to Hospitals Subject to the Prospective Payment SystemSection 1815(e)(1)(A) of the Act, as added by section 9311(a)(1) of Pub.L. 99-509, requires that payment on a PIP basis must be made availableto a hospital subject to the prospective payment system, including a distinctpart psychiatric or rehabilitation unit of the hospital, if__andbullet; The hospital's intermediary does not meet the prompt payment ofclaims requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutivecalendar months (see discussion above);andbullet; The hospital requests payment on a PIP basis; and andbullet; The hospital meets the requirements for receiving PIP that werein effect on October 1, 1986, as set forth in regulations at andSection;405.454(j). (Those regulations are now codified at andSection; 413.64(h),and we are amending that provision as appropriate to conform to the formerandSection; 405.454(j).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The hospital can continue to receive PIP until the intermediary meetsthe requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutivecalendar months. Section 9311(a)(2) of Pub. L. 99-509 specifies that the amendment madeby section 9311(a)(1) of Pub. L. 99-509 is effective for claims receivedon or after July 1, 1987. Under this provision, once a prospective paymenthospital is receiving PIP, it will not be removed from PIP until the earlierof the end of the first period of three consecutive calendar months duringeach of which the intermediary has met the prompt payment requirementsor the date the hospital no longer meets the requirements to qualify forPIP that are set forth in andSection; 413.64(h). For example, if a hospitalis receiving PIP, and its intermediary meets the prompt payment requirementsfor two months and then fails to meet the requirements for the third month,the intermediary would have to meet the requirements for the next threeconsecutive calendar months in order to remove the hospital from PIP. In the same manner, in the case of a hospital not on PIP, an intermediarymust fail to meet the prompt payment requirements for three consecutivecalendar months before a hospital could request PIP under this provision.That is, if an intermediary has been meeting the prompt payment requirements,fails to meet the requirements for two months, and then meets them againin the third month, its hospitals could not receive PIP unless the intermediaryfails to meet the prompt payment requirements for another three consecutivecalendar months. In addition, section 9311(a)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509 provides that, for ahospital that was receiving payment on a PIP basis as of June 30, 1987,and that has requested continuation of payment on that basis, PIP mustbe continued (provided the hospital continues to meet the requirementsfor receiving PIP) until at least the end of the first period of threeconsecutive calendar months, beginning no earlier than April 1987, duringall of which the intermediary met the prompt payment of claims requirementsof section 1816(c)(2) of the Act. Therefore, unless an intermediary hasmet the prompt payment requirements for each of April, May, and June of1987, a prospective payment hospital that was receiving PIP as of June30, 1987, could continue to receive PIP beginning on July 1, 1987. Thehospital may continue on PIP until the intermediary meets the prompt paymentrequirements for three consecutive calendar months. For example, if an intermediary has met the prompt payment requirementsfor April, May, and July and meets them in August and September of 1987,but not for June 1987, a hospital receiving PIP as of June 30, 1987, willcontinue to receive PIP, upon its request, for discharges occurring throughSeptember 30, 1987. However, if an intermediary did not meet the promptpayment requirements in April 1987, but meets it in May, June, and July1987, the same hospital will be eligible to continue receiving PIP onlyfor discharges occurring through July 31, 1987. For those hospitals that were not receiving PIP as of June 30, 1987, weare also using April 1987 as the beginning month for determining whetherthey were eligible for PIP beginning on July 1, 1987. Therefore, if a hospitalwas not receiving PIP as of June 30, 1987, that hospital was eligible torequest PIP after June 1987 only if its intermediary failed to meet theprompt payment requirements for each of April, May, and June 1987 and thehospital meets the requirements of andSection; 413.64(h) for receiving PIP.If the intermediary met the requirements in any one of these months, thehospital does not have an opportunity to request PIP until after its intermediaryfails to meet the prompt payment requirements for three consecutive calendarmonths. (We discuss below the manner in which intermediaries will notifytheir hospitals of the availability of PIP and how the hospitals can requestPIP.)In the case of hospitals that were receiving PIP on June 30, 1987, andthat wanted to continue PIP after that date, the law is not specific asto when the hospital must have made its request to continue PIP. However,based on our reading of section 9311(a)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509, which addresseshospitals on PIP as of June 30, 1987, that want to continue on PIP, webelieve Congress intended that hospitals would notify their intermediariesprior to July 1, 1987, in order to ensure that PIP, in fact, continuedon that date. In Program Memorandum A-87-4 (issued in May 1987), HCFA directedthose intermediaries that anticipated that they would not meet the promptpayment requirements in April, May, and June to inform their hospitalsof the date prior to July 1, 1987, by which the hospitals must notify theintermediaries of their request to continue PIP. Without this notification,we expect that intermediaries will have terminated PIP to those hospitalsfor discharges occurring on or after July 1, 1987. If an intermediary failedto meet the prompt payment requirements for April, May, and June, PIP willhave continued uninterrupted for hospitals that timely submitted theirrequests to continue PIP.In the case of a hospital not on PIP, an intermediary will notify its prospectivepayment hospitals of their eligibility for PIP under the provisions ofsection 1815(e)(1)(A) of the Act if it has not been in compliance withthe prompt payment provisions for three consecutive calendar months. Anintermediary will notify its hospitals within seven working days afterthe end of the third consecutive calendar month in which it has failedto meet the prompt payment requirements. After the intermediary receivesa hospital's request for PIP, it will process the request under its usualprocedures for provider requests for PIP. However, if the hospital's requestis received by the intermediary by the 15th day of the month (or the firstregular business day after the 15th), the intermediary will initiate PIPfor a qualifying hospital effective with discharges occurring on or afterthe first day of the following month (that is, the second month after thethird consecutive calendar month in which the intermediary failed to meetthe prompt payment requirements). Subsequent notification will not be givenwhile the intermediary continues not to be in compliance.When the intermediary has again met the prompt payment requirements forthree consecutive calendar months, the hospitals will receive notice concurrentwith their removal from PIP, which will be effective with discharges occurringthe first day of the month following the third consecutive month in whichthe requirements were met.Sections 1815(e)(1) (B) and (C) of the Act require that PIP be continuedfor two classes of hospitals subject to the prospective payment systemregardless of their intermediaries' ability to meet the prompt paymentrequirements. Under section 1815(e)(1)(B) of the Act, payment must be madeon a PIP basis to hospitals that were receiving PIP as of June 30, 1987,have a disproportionate share adjustment percentage of at least 5.1 percentas computed for purposes of establishing the average standardized amountsfor discharges occurring in FY 1987, continue to meet the requirementsfor receiving PIP set forth in andSection; 413.64(h) as in effect on October1, 1986, and request payment on a PIP basis. Similarly, section 1815(e)(1)(C)of the Act specifies that payment must be made on a PIP basis to hospitalsthat were receiving PIP as of June 30, 1987, are located in a rural areaand have 100 or fewer beds, continue to meet the requirements for receivingPIP set forth in andSection; 413.64(h) as in effect on October 1, 1986, andrequest payment on a PIP basis.For both of these types of hospitals, the opportunity to continue PIP isavailable only once. As in the case with hospitals addressed in section9311(a)(3) of Pub. L. 99-509, the law is not specific as to when thesehospitals must request to continue PIP. However, our reading of sections1815(e)(1) (B) and (C) of the Act and of the accompanying conference agreement(H.R. Rep. No. 1012, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 299 (1986)) clearly indicatesthat Congress believed that these types of hospitals should have the opportunityto continue PIP only if they were receiving such payments on June 30, 1987.Therefore, we believe that it intended that hospitals that meet these criteriawould notify their intermediaries prior to July 1, 1987, in order to ensurethat PIP, in fact, was continued on that date. In Program Memorandum A-87-4,HCFA also directed intermediaries to inform these hospitals of the dateprior to July 1, 1987, by which they must have received the hospitals'notification requesting to continue PIP. Without this notification, weexpect that intermediaries will have terminated PIP to those hospitalsfor discharges occurring on or after July 1, 1987.The conference agreement also speaks of the availability of continuingPIP after June 30, 1987 for these types of hospitals ``during the costreporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987,'' that is, beginning onor after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987. Read literally, thiscould be interpreted as permitting the hospital, depending on its specificcost reporting period, to request PIP or, in the case of section 1815(e)(1)(C)of the Act, to qualify as a rural hospital with 100 or fewer beds, longafter June 30, 1987. However, if the hospital was receiving PIP on June30, 1987, PIP would have been eliminated on July 1, either because thehospital did not request PIP or because it did not qualify under section1815(e)(1)(C) of the Act. Therefore, a later request would not be a requestto continue PIP but rather one to initiate it. We believe it would be inconsistentwith the express terms of the statute to permit these hospitals to continuePIP. Thus, we have not adopted the conference agreement language that thesehospitals can request PIP or can qualify under 1815(e)(1)(C) ``during thecost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987'' to the extent thatsuch event occurs after July 1, 1987.Hospitals with a disproportionate share adjustment percentage of at least5.1 percent have already been identified during the calculation of theaverage standardized amounts for discharges occurring during FY 1987. Thehospitals' intermediaries have notified those hospitals of which they areaware of their eligibility to request to continue to receive PIP underthe disproportionate share provision.Although we believe that the statute and accompanying conference agreementlanguage clearly state that hospitals meeting the 5.1 percent criterionare to be identified from the data base used by HCFA in the calculationof the average standardized amounts for discharges occurring in FY 1987,we also believe that Congress intended that we be equitable in our selectionof those hospitals that meet the criterion.The percentage of Medicaid patient days to total patient days used in determininga hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage was based onMedicaid data from 1984 hospital cost reports. To ensure the most accuratestandardization of the rates for discharges occurring in FY 1987, we madeevery attempt to secure the most accurate and complete Medicaid data possiblewithin the timeframe available to us to develop the rates.However, we have found that in some cases, despite our efforts, data applicableto 1984 were not entered into our data base for purposes of the computationof the rates. In some of these cases, the data had been properly submittedby the hospital, but was inadvertently excluded from the data base. Inother cases, hospitals did not submit the data to HCFA.We believe that data that are applicable to 1984 should be considered indetermining if a hospital has a disproportionate share adjustment percentageof at least 5.1, even if they were not included in the calculation of theFY 1987 rates. Therefore, intermediaries are considering any previouslyunsubmitted 1984 Medicaid data that are received from hospitals in theirdetermination of whether or not a hospital qualifies for PIP under thisprovision. A hospital that qualifies for PIP as a disproportionate sharehospital will not lose its eligibility to receive PIP unless the hospitalno longer meets the requirements of andSection; 413.64(h) or the hospitalrequests to be removed from PIP.A hospital qualifies as a rural hospital if it is located in any area outsideof a metropolitan statistical area or New England County metropolitan area,as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget. See andSection;412.62(f). The hospitals' intermediaries have also notified those hospitalsthat are eligible to request PIP under this provision.If a hospital that is eligible to receive PIP under section 1815(e)(1)(B) or (C) of the Act has not requested PIP by the date prior to July 1,1987 specified by its intermediary or is receiving PIP on that date butis later removed from PIP at its own request or as a result of not meetingthe requirements for receiving PIP, its opportunity to receive PIP at somelater time will be the same as for other prospective payment hospitals;that is, eligibility for receiving PIP will be dependent on its intermediary'sfailure to meet the prompt payment requirements for three consecutive calendarmonths.With regard to the count of beds in rural hospitals, a bed means a generalroutine or intensive care adult or pediatric bed maintained in a patientcare area for inpatient lodging. It does not include beds assigned to newborns,to custodial or domiciliary care, to units excluded from the prospectivepayment system, to hospital-based skilled nursing facilities, or to areasmaintained and utilized for only a portion of a patient's stay. See andSection;3600.1A5 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13-3), added bytransmittal No. 1337, July 1987. This is the definition that is currentlyused for making bed size determinations for other provisions of the prospectivepayment system. See andSection;andSection; 412.106(a)(3) and 412.118(b).A hospital requesting PIP under this provision must attest in writing that,as of July 1, 1987, it is a rural hospital with 100 or fewer beds as definedabove. The intermediary will verify a hospital's attestation as necessary.Hospitals that are determined not to be rural hospitals, or to exceed 100beds, do not qualify even if they previously were believed by the intermediaryto qualify under this provision. Rural hospitals that only meet the criteriaafter July 1, 1987 will not be eligible for this one-time opportunity toreceive PIP. Hospitals that receive PIP under this provision that at somelater date no longer qualify as a rural hospital or no longer have 100or fewer beds will be removed from PIP under this provision. We are redesignating and revising andSection; 413.64 (k)(1) through (k)(5)as a new andSection; 412.116 to implement the provisions of section 1815(e)(1)of the Act. In addition, andSection; 413.64(k)(6), which deals with reductionsin capital payments under section 1886(g)(3) of the Act, is revised andredesignated as a new andSection; 412.113(a)(2). (We have made a technicalchange in andSection; 412.113(a)(1) to reflect the fact that hospitals subjectto the prospective payment system continue to be paid in part on the basisof a hospital-specific portion.) Section 1815(e)(3) of the Act specifies that, in the case of a hospitalsubject to the prospective payment system that has signficant cash flowproblems resulting from operations of its intermediary or from unusualcircumstances of the hospital's operation, the Secretary may make availableappropriate accelerated payments. Accelerated payments are currently availableto all providers that have experienced financial difficulties due to adelay by the intermediary in making payments or in exceptional situationsin which the provider has experienced a temporary delay in preparing andsubmitting bills to the intermediary beyond its normal billing cycle asset forth in regulations at andSection; 413.64(g). However, we are addinga provision to andSection; 412.116 to specify that accelerated payments areavailable to hospitals subject to the prospective payment system. Since we began making accelerated payments to providers, it has been ourpolicy that these payments should not be available to providers receivingPIP since problems related to bill processing and bill payment do not occurfor a provider on PIP. To the best of our knowledge, this policy has beenconsistently applied to providers requesting accelerated payments. We believe that the addition of section 1815(e)(3) to the Act, in specifyingthe availability of accelerated payments to hospitals subject to the prospectivepayment system, was not intended to alter our policy of making acceleratedpayments available only to providers not receiving PIP that meet the criteriain andSection; 413.64(g). This belief is supported by the language of section1815(e)(3) of the Act which states that `` . . . the Secretary <T3>may </T3>make available appropriate accelerated payments (emphasisadded).'' Since Congress did not state that the Secretary <T3>must </T3>make accelerated payments available, we are permitted tocontinue our existing policy. Accordingly, as a part of this rule, we areclarifying in the regulations (andSection;andSection; 412.116 and 413.64(g))that accelerated payments are available only for providers not on PIP.As discussed above, in the August 15, 1986 final rule, which would haveeliminated PIP for all hospitals effective July 1, 1987, we provided fora special one-time interim payment to be made to prospective payment hospitalsfor unusually long lengths of stay. (See andSection; 413.64(k)(5).) If requestedby the hospital, the special payment (equal to the hospital's Federal ratemultiplied by the appropriate diagnosis-related group weighting factor)was to be made if a beneficiary's length of stay exceeds 30 days. Any interimpayment was to be applied against the final payment made for the discharge.The amendments made by section 9311(a) of Pub. L. 99-509 did not includeany provision for interim payments to prospective payment hospitals thatare not on PIP. We believe that Congress was well aware of the provisionsof the August 15, 1986 final rule and, in fact, Congress adopted portionsof that rule in developing the PIP provisions of section 9311 of Pub. L.99-509. There is no discussion in the conference agreement, nor in eitherthe House bill or Senate amendment upon which the conference agreementwas based, concerning the need for an interim payment for long stays forprospective payment hospitals not receiving PIP. We believe that it isclear that, in light of the changes it was making to PIP, Congress didnot believe such a provision was necessary. Therefore, we are deletingthis provision from the regulations. B. Payment to Hospitals Excluded from the Prospective Payment System andOther Providers Section 1815(e)(2) of the Act requires that PIP be available under thestandards established in andSection; 413.64(h) as in effect on October 1,1986, for the following services if the provider elects to receive andqualifies for PIP: andbullet; Inpatient hospital services of a hospital that is excluded fromthe prospective payment system. andbullet; Inpatient hospital services of a hospital that is receiving paymentunder a State reimbursement control system under section 1814(b)(3) or1886(c) of the Act if payment on a PIP basis is an integral part of thesystem. andbullet; Home health services. andbullet; Extended care services.andbullet; Hospice care.    Section 413.64(h) currently provides for payment of PIP for skilled nursingfacility (SNF) services, home health agency (HHA) services, and inpatienthospital services furnished in hospitals receiving payment in accordancewith a State demonstration project or reimbursement control system in whichpayment on a PIP basis is specifically approved by HCFA as a part of thesystem. Therefore, we are revising that section of the regulations to addhospitals excluded from the prospective payment system. We are adding anew andSection; 418.307 to the hospice regulations to specify that PIP isavailable for hospice care effective with claims received on or after July1, 1987.Section 9311(a) of Pub. L. 99-509 does not make any provision for paymentof PIP to hospitals that are receiving payment under a State reimbursementcontrol system under section 1814(b)(3) or 1886(c) of the Act in whichPIP is not an integral part of the system. However, because we do not believethat these hospitals should be disadvantaged, we are providing in the regulations(andSection; 413.64(h)(ii)) that these hospitals are eligible to receivePIP under the same circumstances as prospective payment hospitals (thatis, the provisions of section 1815(e)(1) of the Act as set forth in andSection;412.116) or as hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system (andSection;413.64(h)(i)). Thus, a hospital, which would otherwise be subject to theprospective payment system, whose State reimbursement control system doesnot include PIP as an integral part will be eligible to receive PIP ifits intermediary fails to meet the prompt payment requirements of section1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months or if the hospitalmeets the disproportionate share or small rural hospital criterion. Theintermediaries will notify all eligible hospitals whose State reimbursementcontrol system does not meet the requirements for receiving PIP under andSection;413.64(h)(ii) of their eligibility to receive PIP under the provisionsof section 1815(e)(1) of the Act or andSection; 413.64(h)(i). We have determinedthat of the two States currently operating under this type of system, PIPis an integral part of the reimbursement system in New Jersey and is notan integral part of the system in Maryland.III. Regulatory Impact AnalysisExecutive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a finalregulatory impact analysis for any regulation that meets one of the E.O.criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin_andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis thatis consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612), unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, we treat all hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, and hospices as small entities.Since this rule, except for a few technical provisions, merely conformsthe regulations to the statutory requirements, we have determined thata regulatory impact analysis is not required. Further, we have determined,ary certifies, that this final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, and we have thereforenot prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Required Information</ITAG>A. Waiver of Proposed RulemakingWe ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for substantive rules to provide a period forpublic comment. However, we may waive that procedure if we find good causethat notice and comment are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to publicinterest.As discussed in detail above, we published a final rule on August 15, 1986that, effective with services furnished on or after July 1, 1987, eliminatedpayment on a PIP basis for all hospitals except rural hospitals with fewerthan 100 beds and hospitals receiving payment under a demonstration projector State reimbursement control system in which a form of interim paymentsimilar to PIP is specifically approved as a part of the demonstrationor control system. Section 9311(a) of Pub. L. 99-509 restores PIP as anoption for all hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system effectivewith claims received on or after July 1, 1987. In addition, PIP will, forthe first time, be available for hospice care. Section 9311(a) of Pub.L. 99-509 also provides for payment to be made on a PIP basis to prospectivepayment hosptials whose intermediaries do not meet the prompt payment requirementsof section 1816(c)(2) of the Act, as well as to certain disproportionateshare hospitals and small rural hospitals.The regulations published in final in this rule implement the statutoryprovisions as Congress intended. The regulations are beneficial to hospitalsexcluded from the prospective payment system since they allow these hospitalsto continue receiving payment on a PIP basis.    The regulations are also of benefit to prospective payment hospitals inthat they allow two classes of those hospitals to continue receiving PIPand the remainder to receive PIP when their intermediaries fail to makeprompt payment. Additionally, we have already notified the intermediariesin a program memorandum (as discussed above) to take certain actions toimplement section 9311 of Pub. L. 99-509. Finally, we had already had thebenefit of public comments concerning the availability of PIP to providersin response to the proposal to eliminate PIP that we published on June3, 1986 (51 FR 19970). For these reasons, we believe that it would be contraryto the public interest to delay implementation of the statutory provisionsuntil the process of publishing both proposed and final rules can be completed.Therefore, we find good cause to waive proposed rulemaking and to issuethese regulations as final. Nonetheless, we are providing a 60-day periodfor public comment as indicated in the beginning of this preamble.Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receiveconcerning regulations, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to thecomments individually. However, if we decide that changes are necessaryas a result of our consideration of timely comments, we will issue a finalrule and respond to the comments in the preamble of that rule.B. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3511) requires thatany information collection requirements included in a regulatory documentmust be submitted to and approved by the Executive Office of Managementand Budget (EOMB) before the public is required to comply with those requirements.The requirements of these regulations do not impose any information collectionrequirements that must be approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Therefore,they need not be reviewed by EOMB for that purpose.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>42 CFR Part 412Health facilities, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.42 CFR Part 413Health facilities, Kidney diseases, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.42 CFR Part 418Health facilities, Hospice care, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.42 CFR Chapter IV is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="72">CHAPTER IV_HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTHAND HUMAN SERVICES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subchapter B_Medicare Programs</ITAG>I.

For purposes ofthis paragraph, a hospital that is receiving periodic interim paymentsas of June 30, 1987 and meets the requirements of andSection;413.64(h) ofthis chapter may continue to receive payment on this basis until the hospital'sintermediary meets the requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act forthree consecutive calendar months beginning with April 1987.

These interim paymentsare reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted ifnecessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if a hospital receives interimpayments for less than a full reporting period.(ii) For purposes of determining periodic interim payments under this paragraph,a hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount is computed asfollows: (A) If a hospital has no payment experience under the prospective paymentsystem, the intermediary computes the hospital's estimated average prospectivepayment amount by multiplying its payment rates as determined under andSection;412.70(c), but without adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the hospital'scase-mix index, and subtracting from this amount estimated deductiblesand coinsurance. (B) If a hospital has payment experience under the prospective paymentsystem, the intermediary computes a hospital's estimated average prospectivepayment amount based on that payment experience, adjusted for projectedchanges, and subtracts from this amount estimated deductibles and coinsurance.(4) Termination of periodic interim payments._(i) <T3>Request by the hospital. </T3>A hospital receiving periodic interimpayments may convert to payments on a per discharge basis at any time.(ii) <T3>Removal by the intermediary. </T3>An intermediary terminates periodicinterim payments if_ (A) A hospital no longer meets the requirements of andSection; 413.64(h);(B) A hospital is receiving payment under the criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(i)of this section and the intemediary meets the prompt payment requirementsof section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months;or (C) A hospital that is receiving payment under the criterion set forthin paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section no longer meets the criterion.(iii) <T3>Limitation on reelection. </T3>If a hospital that is receiving periodicinterim payments under the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)or (b)(1)(iii) of this section is removed from that method of payment eitherby its own request or by the intermediary, it may reelect to receive periodicinterim payments only under the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i)of this section. (c) <T3>Special interim payments for certain costs. </T3>For capital-relatedcosts and the direct costs of medical education, which are not includedin prospective payments but are reimbursed as specified in andSection;andSection;413.130 and 413.85 of this chapter, respectively, interim payments aremade subject to final cost settlement. Interim payments for capital-relateditems and the estimated cost of approved medical education programs (applicableto inpatient costs payable under Part A and for kidney acquisition costsin hospitals approved as renal transplantation centers) are determinedby estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the previousyear's experience and on substantiated information for the current yearand divided into 26 equal biweekly payments. Each payment is made two weeksafter the end of a biweekly period of services, as described in andSection;413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. The interim payments are reviewed by theintermediary at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted ifnecessary. (d) <T3>Special interim payments for the indirect costs of medical education.</T3>Payments for the indirect costs of medical education (described inandSection; 412.118) are paid based on an estimate of the total for the Federalportion of the diagnosis-related group revenue to be received in the currentperiod. The total estimated annual amount of the adjustment is dividedinto 26 equal biweekly payments and included with other inpatient costsreimbursed on a reasonable cost basis. This estimate is subject to year-endadjustment. Each payment is made two weeks after the end of the biweeklyperiod of services. The interim payments are reviewed by the intermediaryat least twice during their reporting period and adjusted if necessary.(e) <T3>Outlier payments. </T3>Payments for outlier cases (described in SubpartF of this part) are not made on an interim basis. (f) <T3>Accelerated payments</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>Upon request, an accelerated payment may be madeto a hospital that is not receiving periodic interim payments under paragraph(b) of this section if the hospital is experiencing financial difficultiesbecause of the following: (i) There is a delay by the intermediary in making payment to the hospital.(ii) Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in thehospital's preparation and submittal of bills to the intermediary beyondits normal billing cycle. (2) <T3>Approval of payment. </T3>A hospital's request for an accelerated paymentmust be approved by the intermediary and HCFA.
