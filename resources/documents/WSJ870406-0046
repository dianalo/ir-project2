As of Sunday, the transit fare for the agency's PATH system will be raised to $1 from 75 cents, and the round-trip toll rates for cars and buses using the tunnels and bridges will increase to $3 from $2, the authority said.    The PATH system connects the New Jersey cities of Newark, Jersey City and Hoboken with midtown and downtown Manhattan. The bridges and tunnels affected are the George Washington Bridge; the Holland and Lincoln tunnels, which connect Manhattan with New Jersey; and the Goethals and Bayonne bridges and the Outerbridge Crossing, which connect New Jersey with Staten Island.    The rate increases will help pay for a $1.5 billion improvement system that will include new cars and longer trains for the PATH system, and rehabilitation and maintenance of the bridges and tunnels. An authority spokesman said the increases will result in annualized gross revenue of about $160 million.    Philip D. Kaltenbacher, the authority's chairman, said the increases &quot;are essential to help finance the massive capital improvements that will be required over the next five years to meet continued growth in demand for interstate ground transportation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
