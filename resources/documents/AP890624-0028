Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., had the measure tacked onto anunrelated child care bill late Friday.   ``I'm confident it's constitutional,'' Biden, chairman of theSenate Judiciary Committee and a leading congressional liberal, toldhis colleagues.   The move in the Senate came as several lawmakers introducedconstitutional amendments in the House following the Supreme Courtdecision. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said such attemptsshould be taken cautiously and that it would ``be extraordinarilyslow to amend the First Amendment to the Constitution,'' which is``at the heart of our constitutional liberties and freedom.''   Biden said his simple legislation could accomplish the same aimas a constitutional amendment.   The bill reads: ``Whoever knowingly and publicly mutilates,defaces, burns, displays on the floor or ground, or tramples uponany flag of the United States shall be fined not more than $1,000 orimprisoned for not more than one year, or both.''   Biden's bill is identical to the federal statute on flagdesecration except it removes the words ``cast contempt.''   The majority Supreme Court opinion reasoned that a Texas statuteon flag desecration violated the First Amendment because it wasaimed at protecting against acts toward the flag which would beoffensive to others. Biden's measure would treat desecration as anact of vandalism without considering whether anyone was offended bythe act, presumably answering the court's First Amendment concerns.   The House may consider next week a resolution similar to the onepassed by the Senate this week expressing opposition to the view ofthe court.   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, a senior Republican on the HouseJudiciary Committee, said he was also exploring ways of gettingaround the decision without a constitutional amendment, possibly bytaking away from the Supreme Court jurisdiction over lawsuits onflag desecration.   ``I think the mood of the House is to do something effective andnot just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag,'' hesaid. A new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
