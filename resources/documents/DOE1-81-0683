<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0683 </DOCNO><TEXT>Time of flight neutron powder data were collected at elevated temperatureson a sample of NASICON of composition Na/sub 3.17/Zr/sub 1.93/Si/sub1.9/O{sub 12}. This sample, prepared by reheating a commercially availableNASICON to minimize the ZrO{sub 2} impurity, has been previously structurallyrefined from room temperature neutron diffraction data collected at ArgonneNational Laboratory. Conductivity measurements show a cusp at ca. 170{sup0}C attributed to the monoclinic-rhombohedral transition and the purposeof this work was to explore the nature of the transition. Data runs weremade at 143, 173, 202, 300, and 391{sup 0}C. No evidence for a crystalsystem change was found. The highest temperature data sets could notbe refined satisfactorily by the Rietveld method using a rhombohedralmodel, but rather required a monoclinic cell in space group C2/c to achieveconvergence. An explanation for the conductivity cusp is given in termsof disordering of the sodium ions and a change in conduction pathwayswhich lowers the barriers to ion movement.</TEXT></DOC>
