The protesters had hired a bus, the bus driver, Marcos Conti,said in an interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.   As the bus approached the Mexican Embassy, the people on the buspulled on black hoods, Conti said. Two Colombian policemen guardingthe embassy, following standing Mexican Embassy instructions aboutsuch takeovers, did not try to use their pistols.   The intruders said they were members of the April 19 Movement.   The military wing of the April 19 Movement, known as M-19,seized the Dominican Republic's embassy and held 16 ambassadorshostage there for two months in 1980.   The M-19 also stormed the government's Palace of Justice inBogota in 1986. Ninety-five people, including 11 Supreme Courtjustices, were killed.   This is the third time in four years the Mexican Embassy hasbeen occupied by people with grievances against the government. Theprevious occupations, by university students, were peaceful.   Many of the poorest areas of Bogota, in the south, have hadwater and electricity rationed for two months as the capital goesthrough its worst drought in 53 years.   The middle-class and upper-class homes in the northern part ofthe capital have not been affected.</TEXT></DOC>
