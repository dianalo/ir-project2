We show that the higher derivative regularization, whichmanifestly preserves the parity invariance when the fermion mass vanishes,automatically leads to a nonvanishing topological term in low energies.Although this higher derivative regularization formally violates thelocal gauge invariance, we propose a systematic way to recover the gaugeinvariance by adding local counter terms dictated by Ward-Takahashi identities.In practical applications, this regularization is interesting in connectionwith the discussion of the dynamaical origin of the quantum Hall effect.</TEXT></DOC>
