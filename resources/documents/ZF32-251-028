(Services).andO;Topic:     MaintenanceThird-Party MaintenanceHardware MaintenanceRepairSupport Services.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Service is an extremely competitive business.andP;  No longer do customersautomatically sign up with a manufacturer's service division.andP;  In 1972, theinfant independent maintenance industry had billings of about $56 million.andO;Today that number is about $1.6 billion.andP;  While the system manufacturersstill command the overwhelming share of the computer maintenance business,the numbers indicate that many users are choosing alternative serviceoptions.andM;The third-party maintenance organizations (TPM) and the original equipmentmanufacturers (OEM) are locked into a battle for your account.andP;  While therewas never any doubt that the manufacturer could maintain and repair yoursystem, TPMs have proved that they too can keep your site up and running.andO;Therefore, it's prudent to have two or three vendors bid for your serviceneeds.andP;  Open competition is the best way to obtain the lowest price for thelevel of service and support you need.andM;Computer maintenance service is usually obtained from one of four sources ora combination of the four:andM;1.andP;  An OEM.andM;2.andP;  A local or regional TPM.andM;3.andP;  A national TPM.andM;4.andP;  An internal self-maintenance division.andM;We'll focus on the first three alternatives.andP;  All may offer quality serviceprograms for preventive maintenance (PM), corrective maintenance and repairs.andO;Response times, hours of coverage and technical expertise also may be equal.andO;And all may offer additional support, training, multivendor equipment serviceand a range of value-added services.andM;Deciding whether to use the OEM's service arm or go with a TPM is tougherthan it used to be.andP;  Not long ago, TPMs maintained only older equipment andoffered basic maintenance.andP;  OEMs serviced only their own systems and offeredrigid maintenance programs that had to be accepted in their entirety.andO;Neither is true anymore.andP;  And both price service and support competitivelyduring the bidding process.andP;  Thus, the important step is to decide exactlywhat you need and whether a local or national firm can supply it best.andM;Local Versus NationalandM;If you have sites around the country or world and insist on one-vendorservice, then either an OEM or a large TPM is a must.andP;  You'll have to selecta service vendor from a limited field, since only a few companies can fullysupport operations dispersed over a wide area.andM;On the other hand, if you have one site or multiple sites in a limitedgeographic area or if you aren't concerned about using multiple servicevendors, you have an enormous supply of service providers from which tochoose.andP;  Remember that service can be just as efficient and competent from asmall, local firm as from a large, national firm.andM;Some would have you believe that all local service operations employ one tofive technicians, have no spares, work in a vertical market and generallyoperate from someone's garage.andP;  And some would have you believe that theregional service vendor is nothing more than a local service operationworking out of a network of garages.andP;  Sometimes this is true, but more oftenit isn't.andM;Last year I checked out a local operation in Southern California, which isowned and operated by one FE.andP;  I discovered that when competently run, localservice can be a viable source of service for a specific type of customer.andP;  Aservice customer with older DP systems (e.g., PDP/11s) used in noncritical,nonrevenue-producing applications can save many dollars with a one-person,low-overhead vendor.andP;  Occasionally it may take two or three days to get arequired part and put the system back into operation.andP;  But many customers canafford this kind of downtime if it means maintenance costs of one-half toone-third the going contract rates.andM;The operation I visited actually worked out of a garage.andP;  But theentrepreneur had many years of experience on PDP/11 systems, and he had twocomplete systems for spare parts.andP;  He was factory-trained, knew the systemshe serviced and had the industry connections to get whatever parts and backuphe required.andP;  He has been in business for more than six years.andM;Other local and regional service vendors are anything but garage operations.andO;For example, U.S.andP;  Computer Maintenance is a local service provider in theNew York metropolitan area.andP;  It services the full line of DEC products upthrough the VAX 8700, including all associated peripherals.andP;  The company hastwo offices, 22 technicians and more than 500 customers.andP;  Its10,000-square-foot main office includes a warehouse of spares and a fullyequipped and operating computer room.andM;SMS Systems Maintenance Services is a regional vendor serving New England andthe New York and New Jersey areas.andP;  SMS operates from four offices, and eachis equipped with a multisystem computer room used for testing and hot spareswhen needed.andP;  SMS services all DEC systems up through the VAX 8810.andP;  Itemploys 30 technicians and handles about 600 accounts.andM;Locals TalkandM;&quot;When dealing with a local service vendor, you're assured that its spareparts inventory and technical expertise are close at hand.andP;  The big inventorydollar figures and numbers of technical personnel thrown at you by thenationals mean little if the parts are stored across the country and theclosest technical backup is a day's plane trip away,&quot; states Stephen Davies,president of U.S.andP;  Computer Maintenance.andM;Davis also notes other advantages.andP;  &quot;With a local firm you can meet the FEswho will handle your account and talk to top management directly.andP;  Withmanagement close at hand, field personnel are more likely to follow thecompany's philosophy.andP;  It's also easier to resolve any problems that mayarise.&quot;andM;With a local firm, there's one consistent level of service, notes Davies.andO;Further, local firms are more likely to promote, not just offer, thesingle-year service contract.andP;  With maintenance costs continuing theirdownward spiral, there are no inherent benefits to the multiyear contract.andM;&quot;A smaller vendor has to be technically superior to its larger counterparts,&quot;states Tom Welch, president of SMS Systems Maintenance Services.andP;  &quot;It has tobe flexible and willing to bend to meet customer needs.andP;  To compete foraccounts, we must be perceived as being better than, not just equal to, thebig, known names.andM;&quot;Many companies that portray themselves as having a national posture inreality may not be able to adjust logistics for a local market,&quot; hecontinues.andP;  &quot;It may take a day or more to 'fly in' parts or technicalassistance.andP;  We can be at a site with the needed part within a half-hour toan hour.andP;  Response time in a given locality may be in favor of the localvendor,&quot; says Welch.andM;Small service vendors take the time to gain a complete, well-roundedunderstanding of the customer's entire system (DEC and non-DEC products),according to Welch.andP;  Today, third-party peripherals are often predominant assystem add-ons.andP;  These non-DEC products often are revision-sensitive, i.e.,andO;they work only with a certain software version or at a specific hardwarerevision.andP;  Welch believes that the smaller TPMs are better able to handlethese products.andM;Low price is another incentive for customers to use a small service firm.andP;  Toentice potential customers to leave OEMs, all TPMs, local or national, mustperform OEM-level service at a reduced cost.andP;  Local and regional servicefirms usually have lower costs than their bigger counterparts and thus chargeless.andM;But while cost is an important part of any business's purchasing decision,your choice of a service or support vendor for your DP systems should also bebased on reputation for reliability and quality and on who can best meet yourservice or support needs.andM;National AdvantagesandM;Novadyne Computer Systems is a large, national, independent provider ofservice and support for DEC-based systems and sites.andP;  According to BertNovak, president of Novadyne, a large company has more density of product andtherefore a wider variety of expertise than smaller vendors.andP;  They're largeenough to bear the cost of maintaining a complete spares inventory for allequipment under contract -- whether PCs, mainframes, peripherals or officeproducts.andP;  At Novadyne, parts are accessible to FEs 24 hours per day via anautomated online system.andM;Novadyne provides one-source maintenance, which reduces paperwork andeliminates trying to contact several manufacturers.andP;  &quot;Since DEC is a leadingnetworker, many of its customer sites have multiple types of systems andperipherals.andP;  We can offer our service customers a single source of serviceand support on these multivendor products.andP;  And because of our nationwidepresence, we can take network responsibility end to end,&quot; states Novak.andM;Pat Dwight, a Novadyne spokesperson, notes that customers thinking of leavingOEM service are often anxious about the capabilities of a TPM.andP;  &quot;They haveconcerns about the level of overall field support, especially in the areas ofspares and PM,&quot; she says.andP;  &quot;But larger TPMs like Novadyne have the capabilityand capacity, both technical and financial, to provide total support equal tothat of the OEM, but at a reduced cost.&quot;andM;DEC's Steve Adriane, corporate programs manager for customer services, speaksfor the OEM.andP;  &quot;The first thing to do before selecting a servicer is toevaluate your needs.andP;  Ask yourself what is it you want to accomplish and getclear on it.&quot;andP;  Then ask yourself, &quot;Can this supplier support the criticalityof my operation today and tomorrow?andP;  Is the supplier someone who understandsthe differences in multivendor products?andP;  And do they have the breadth ofsupport for the task?&quot;andM;Someone buying service for a home computer has different needs than someonewho depends on the computer for the life of his company, says Adriane.andO;Technology is constantly changing, and you need a support vendor who canchange and grow with it.andP;  The vendor must have the finances to support thisgrowth.andM;All agree that it's costly to stock spares for all multivendor productsserviced.andP;  Large national service vendors say they have the resources to dothis, while small firms don't.andP;  Large national vendors also claim to havefewer single-system locations and therefore usually have sufficient densityin a local area to cost-justify nearby spares warehousing.andM;Novadyne and DEC believe that their service delivery is consistentnationwide.andP;  Both use centralized call processing systems.andP;  According toAdriane, the majority of DEC's service calls come into its Customer SupportCenters (CSC).andP;  There are three CSCs in the U.S.andP;  and 11 worldwide.andP;  Serviceand support requests come from around the country and are routed to theappropriate CSC.andP;  Routing is based on equipment type, not location.andM;IT ISN'T EASY to choose a service vendor.andP;  All good service companies havesomething to offer, be it nationwide support or local, almost personalizedaccount service.andP;  Some offer technical expertise in networking environments,while others' expertise lies in specific multivendor or vertical markets.andO;Some are quicker than others, but all meet their stated or contractedresponse times.andM;Some service vendors rely on remote monitoring or troubleshooting techniquesas a first response, while others prefer to dispatch an FE immediately.andP;  Allhave some type of internal system for getting a part to a site when it'sneeded, whether the part is stored locally or at a designated warehouse.andM;OEM service is usually more expensive that TPM service, and national TPMsusually charge more than local or regional organizations.andP;  But pricingshouldn't be the main determiner if your company's lifeblood is its computersystems.andP;  Seek out the service vendor that will provide the specialcombination of offerings and abilities that fit your critical support needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
