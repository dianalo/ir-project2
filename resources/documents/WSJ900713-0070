Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, inannouncing the proposed requirements, said &quot;the consumershould be able to read and understand food labels, based onreliable and vital information. These proposed regulationswill help make food labels more clear and cogent.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Currently, nutrition labeling is voluntarily included bysome food packagers but is required only on fortified foodsand those for which nutritional claims are made. FDAofficials estimated that the proposed regulations would costthe food industry approximately $300 million in one-timecosts. The industry and consumer groups will be allowed 30days to comment on the proposed requirements.   One change would create new definitions for claimsconcerning cholesterol levels. Products could be called&quot;cholesterol free&quot; if they contain less than two milligrams aserving, while also containing less than five grams of totalfat and less than two grams of saturated fat a serving.   Products could be designated &quot;low cholesterol&quot; if theycontain less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol a serving andthe same total and saturated fat levels as those incholesterol-free products. Manufacturers could call theirproducts &quot;reduced cholesterol&quot; if they contain 75% lesscholesterol than similar products of their own label orcomparable products of other companies.   Among the other changes proposed by Secretary Sullivan isadding nutritional information for four food components whiledropping it for four others. Those added would becholesterol, saturated fat and calories from fat and fiber.Those dropped would be thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and oneof the two protein listings.   Frank Scarbrough, director of the Office of Nutrition atthe Food and Drug Administration, said the shufflingrepresents a desire by the FDA to &quot;concentrate on substancesthat are the cause of chronic diseases.&quot; He added that theproblems resulting from deficiencies in the droppedsubstances have largely disappeared as public health problemsin the U.S.   A spokesman for Quaker Oats Co., a Chicago-based maker ofcereals and other food products, said the company had beenexpecting the changes. &quot;We are strong proponents of providingmeaningful nutritional information. It sounds like these arechanges that are going to be beneficial,&quot; he said.   John Cady, president of the National Food ProcessorsAssociation, said his organization will study the proposal&quot;and we will hopefully suggest improvements that will resultin even better nutrition labeling to benefit consumers.&quot;   The new regulations would require nutritional labeling onpackaged food that is a &quot;meaningful source&quot; of calories, Dr.Sullivan said. Fresh produce, seafood and other non-packagedfood companies would be allowed some flexibility in informingconsumers of nutritional value, including the use of&quot;point-of-purchase&quot; methods such as posters and booklets.   The FDA also proposed to permit companies to display asecond label below the required one. The second label wouldinclude a &quot;nutritional profile&quot; of certain food components asa percentage of the daily recommended consumption of thecomponent. If the manufacturer used the profile, it wouldhave to include fat, saturated fatty acid, cholesterol,carbohydrates, fiber and salt.   Exemptions to the proposed labeling requirements would beallowed for restaurants, bakeries, individually packaged&quot;bite size&quot; pieces of food and small businesses with annualfood sales of less than $500,000 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
