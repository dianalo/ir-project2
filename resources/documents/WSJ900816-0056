Investment bankers involved in the deals wouldn't indicatehow many of the bondholders have agreed to accept theexchange offer. John Gordon, the chairman of the bondholdercommittee, said he expects the offers to be extended.Furthermore, he said, holdouts who oppose the latest debtswap, while troublesome, won't kill the deal. &quot;One way oranother, this deal will be done,&quot; said Mr. Gordon of DeltecSecurities Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the parties negotiating the deals havecontemplated the possibility of a &quot;pre-packaged&quot; Chapter 11bankruptcy proceeding as a way to eliminate the problem ofholdouts without substantially changing the terms of theagreement. The offer, the fourth put forth by Southland andthe first approved by the bondholder committee, would givebondholders about 25% of the common stock of the company. Thefounding Thompson family of Dallas would get about 5% of thestock and Ito-Yokado, operator of 7-Eleven stores in Japan,would get about 70% for $430 million.   Southland, the troubled parent of the 7-Eleven conveniencestore chain, went into default on its $1.8 billion publiclytraded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced intobankruptcy at that time by getting a tentative approval fromthe bondholder committee for the most recent exchange offer.Banks and other creditors would receive full payment underthe plan.   The Thompson family, which now owns slightly more thantwo-thirds of the company, would see its stake shrink underthe offer to 5%, or about a $25 million investment from about$163 million. The family members took about $200 million outof Southland in the $4.9 billion leveraged buyout that tookthe company private in late 1987 to avoid a possible hostilebid by the Belzberg family of Canada.   According to the offering documents filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, John P. Thompson, Jere W.Thompson and Joe C. Thompson Jr. will receive five-yearemployment contracts from the new owners providing annualbase salaries of $600,000 each, plus an annual bonus equal toabout $360,000 each. In addition, Jere and John will receivethe benefits given other executives. Also, five-year recourseloans of about $32 million will be provided to the Thompsonsat no interest.   Southland owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other conveniencestores in the U.S. and Canada. Increased competition erodedsales and profit margins and made it difficult for thecompany to service the huge debt from the buy-out.</TEXT></DOC>
