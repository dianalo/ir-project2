The Oct. 16 storm killed 17 people and changed Britain'slandscape forever as winds gusting up to 120 mph toppled anestimated 15 million trees.   Homes were wrecked, cars smashed and many parts of Britainsuffered the worst power failures since the World War II blitz.Insurance claims totaled $1.46 billion.   The report to Defense Secretary George Younger came from thestate-run Meteorological Office, under the Defense Department, andfrom an independent panel which studied that report and made itsown inquiries and recommendations.   It said weather experts failed to predict the storm's severitybecause they followed computer projections ``too closely'' and``too rigidly'' and did not take into account other factors.   The report recommended stepping up the warning system when badweather is on the way and giving forecasters the scientificbackground needed to recognize poor computer predictions.   ``Compared with the French forecasters, the training which oursreceive is shorter (and therefore cheaper) and lays less emphasison meteorological theory,'' the report said.   The defense secretary announced he had accepted therecommendations.   The Meteorological Office apparently had no formal system toallow the senior forecaster to consult more widely when faced withuncertain or severe weather, the report said.   It said television forecasts ``played down'' the wind even morethan the Meteorological Office, but in view of the briefing TVweather experts received, they were not to blame.   While the report said forecasters shouldn't rely totally oncomputers, it said the Meteorological Office must have the mostpowerful computer available. It noted a new model will be installedin June.   The worst storm to hit Britain was in 1703 when 8,000 peoplewere killed.</TEXT></DOC>
