Lawmakers had responded with outrage to Cheney's initialannouncement that he would eliminate the $25.9 billion programafter investing nine years and $2 billion in the battlefieldaircraft designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like anairplane.   Cheney called the decision painful but said the program wouldhave to go as he slashed $10 billion in fiscal 1990 spending underthe budget compromise reached by the White House and Congress.   Hopes of congressional supporters were raised Thursday whenDeputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood Jr., indicated the Pentagonwas considering a reprieve for the aircraft as Bell HelicopterTextron Inc. and Boeing Helicopter Co. threatened to halt work onthe project.   Late Friday, however, the Pentagon said the V-22 would remain onthe fiscal 1990 budget cutting floor and warned the contractorsthat they were expected to complete the work required under theirfiscal 1989 contract. That contract does not expire until Sept. 30.   The contractors, meanwhile, said they had suspended their threatof layoffs for the moment, citing the ``strong bipartisancongressional support for the V-22 program.''   That support for the Osprey is emerging from the powerful MarineCorps lobby on Capitol Hill and the concerns of influentiallawmakers, the ranking Republican on the House Armed ServicesCommittee said Friday.   ``The Marine lobby per se is as tough as the NRA (National RifleAssociation),'' said Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, who noted thatafter the considerable investment the Corps does not want to see``a wasted effort on their part.''   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., a member of the House ArmedServices Committee, said that ``year after year the Marines havemade the V-22 their highest priority. It's vital to Marineaviation.''   The V-22 is a revolutionary aircraft that the Marine Corps wantsto use to improve its ability to conduct surprise, long-rangeamphibious assaults. The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9billion on 663 Ospreys, including $1.3 billion in 1990.   The contractors are located in Texas and Pennsylvania, both ofwhich have large and powerful delegations on Capitol Hill.   Bell Helicopter Textron is in Fort Worth, Texas _ home districtof House Speaker Jim Wright. Boeing Helicopter Co. is in the homestate for two active defense lawmakers, Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., aMarine Corps veteran, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.   ``I very definitely hear a building crescendo,'' Dickinson saidFriday. ``I raised that point with Dick Cheney. The hottest andmost political issue will be the V-22. I told him to be ready andexpect a firestorm.''   But lawmakers have begun to suggest other sources of funding tokeep the Osprey program.   ``Star Wars,'' said McCloskey. ``The thinking is that too muchmoney is spent on SDI. For $3 billion you can get all the researchand development you need.''   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said it was too early to tell where the money would comefrom, but then mentioned that ``everybody always looks at the SDImoney like the fox looking at the hen house.''</TEXT></DOC>
