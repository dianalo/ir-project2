Cogeneration is the process of simultaneously producing two useful energy forms, normally electricity and heat, from the same fuel source. It differs from normal central-utility methods, in which the heat created as a byproduct of the electricity production is wasted because there isn't any practical way to deliver the heat to the utility's customers.    Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. will buy electricity generated by the plant, which will burn wood wastes from a sawmill to be built nearby, GE said. Construction is slated to begin in October and end in March 1989.    The plant will also produce steam, which will be used by the sawmill.    The plant will be built for a joint venture between a unit of Conversion Industries Inc., Pasadena, Calif.; and a unit of Delmarva Power andamp; Light Co., a Wilmington, Del., utility. </TEXT></DOC>
