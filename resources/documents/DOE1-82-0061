There are several reasons for carrying outsuch a study in Japan. The population density in Japan is relativelyhigh, the genetic background of the population is relatively homogeneous,and social and economical status of the Japanese people are equivalentand the background for each prefecture has already been reported. However,since the standard deviation of mean exposure rates was relatively largefor each prefecture, the study was limited to cities and towns.</TEXT></DOC>
