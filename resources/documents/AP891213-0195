(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State officials vowed they would fare betteron their next visit to a potential radioactive waste dump siteafter they were chased and cornered for five hours Wednesday byanti-dump protesters.   More than 100 dump opponents scored a moral, if notpsychological victory, when they demanded police arrest them, orthe members of a scouting team from the state Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Siting Commission, for trespassing.   The commission's field teams were on a walking tour of theproposed site in the town of Allen when they were spotted aroundnoon by more than 100 dump opponents, according to protestorganizer Stuart Campbell.   The protesters tracked footprints left by the seven stateofficials as they ran up and down hills in the wooded area beforecatching them on a county road and surrounding them with a humanchain, said Allegany County Sheriff Lawrence Scholes.   The officials were released some five hours later after theowner of the land they were surveying filed a trespassing complaintagainst them.   Meanwhile, 100 miles to the east, 20 protesters were arrested inCortland County for disorderly conduct after they refused to allowa state inspection team to leave one of two potential sites there,according to a sheriff's department dispatcher.   In Allen, Scholes said the protesters ignored warnings to stayaway from the proposed site and camped out there overnight.   The dump opponents said the state officials were on privateproperty and the owner was never told the team would be there toinspect his land.   ``Either you arrest them or you arrest us,'' Sally Campbell ofthe Allegany County Nonviolent Action Group told the officers.   William Giovanniello, the owner of the property, said stateofficials did not have his permission to be on his land. ``Theynever notified me _ no phone call, no nothing,'' he said.   Siting commission staff member Bruce Goodale calledGiovanniello's claim ``sheer nonsense.''   After Giovanniello filed a written complaint against the state,the dump opponents allowed the officials to leave.   As they did, the group howled and yelled, ``See you in themorning.'' Protesters vowed they would again block commissionmembers from inspecting the other two possible dump sites in thecounty.   Goodale promised his group would return.   ``They may feel it is,'' a moral or psychological victory, saidJay Dunkleberger, executive director of the commission, who visitedthe Cortland County site Wednesday. ``I consider it a draw. We didaccomplish the task we set for ourselves for the day.''   Commission officials in the Cortland County town of Taylor hadto be escorted two miles after protesters there formed a humanchain and pinned them in their cars.   The anti-dump group sent cars, trucks and tractors to the siteWednesday morning after members who have been watching the twoTaylor sites around the clock reported the state field crew'sarrival, said Taffy Rook, a spokeswoman for Citizens AgainstRadioactive Dumping.   At one point, three state officials and several deputies were``trapped'' in the woods by protesters who had blocked all roadsleading to the site, Rook said.   Mary Gardner Smith, a spokeswoman for Concerned Citizens ofAllegany County, said about 20 protesters camped out overnight infreezing temperatures at two of the three Allegany sites to blockstate officials from beginning inspections on land there. They werejoined by other protesters at daybreak, she said.   Siting Commission officials said they hoped to start testingpossible sites after the deer hunting season ended Tuesday.   ``I hope that people don't go outside the law,'' said SusanBaranski, a spokeswoman for the commission. ``The courts have madeit clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to dothis.''   Anti-dump groups in Allegany and Cortland counties have promisedto prevent the testing from taking place. The groups said theirprotests would be nonviolent but said they expected arrests.   The five possible sites were chosen by the commission inSeptember. Under federal law, states must have a place to storelow-level radioactive waste by 1993.   The commission plans to complete soil testing and otherevaluations by spring. The commission will then narrow down thenumber of sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.</TEXT></DOC>
