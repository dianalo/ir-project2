It was the first time the rebel Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front said it would participate in the political processas part of the path toward peace.   The rebel plan called for the civil war to end in six months.   ``There is a very good climate,'' said Gregorio Rosa Chavez,auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, who is observing the talks. Hesaid the government also made a proposal, but he refused to discussit.   After Monday's session ended, Salvadoran Justice Minister OscarAlfredo Santamaria told a news conference the talks were held in apositive atmosphere.   ``We feel satisfied,'' he said of progress made.   Santamaria said the government proposed it meet rebelrepresentatives for two days every two months, with the RomanCatholic Church acting as observer and not as mediator.   He was reluctant to predict any outcome.   ``What will happen I don't know,'' Santamaria said.   Farabundo Marti leaders outlined their plan in a statement beforetalks opened to end the decade-old war that has cost more than70,000 lives. Aside from the political participation offer, littlein it was new.   The guerrillas demanded that President Alfredo Cristiani'srightist administration reform the judiciary; prosecute human rightsviolators and end all political repression; and undertakeconstitutional and land reforms.   They proposed that ultrarightists be weeded out of the judicialsystem and the military, now made up of 56,000 soldiers, berestructured and cut down.   They also asked the government to move up the date of ElSalvador's 1991 legislative and municipal elections and allow themto participate as a party.   In exchange, the guerrillas said they would agree to a cease-firestarting no later than Nov. 15 and would begin to integratethemselves into El Salvador's political life.   ``We are not negotiating from a position of weakness,'' saidJoaquin Villalobos, a senior guerrilla leader.   He said the talks will test the Cristiani administration's desirefor peace.   Cristiani refused to answer questions at a brief publicappearance in San Salvador.   Miguel Saenz, a rebel spokesman, told reporters the participantsbegan by discussing procedural matters and an agenda.   Many rebel demands similar to those made Wednesday were rejectedby the rightist-dominated military in three previous negotiatingsessions from 1984 to 1987.   Villalobos said Wednesday that the rebels want a quick end to thewar. He said the Salvadoran people are tired of fighting: ``We areconscious the war has to end.''   Many of the victims of the war against a succession ofU.S.-backed governments have been civilians.   After a cease-fire and government recognition of the rebels as apolitical party, a lasting peace would be negotiated with the frontlaying down its arms, Villalobos said.   Cristiani invited the guerrillas to lay down their arms andengage in peace talks when he succeeded President Jose NapoleonDuarte for a five-year term June 1.   Rebel and government called a temporary cease-fire for thetwo-day peace talks.   The government said earlier it will not negotiate a reduction inthe military and that if the rebels want reform, they should pursueit through the political process.   The rebels boycotted regular elections since 1982, saying suchelections offer only a veneer of democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
