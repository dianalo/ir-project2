(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE DESKTOP DIMENSIONandM;Desktop computing has entered a new dimension in the offices, plants andfactories of U.S.andP;  users.andP;  Powered by high-perforamnce computer chips,smartened by standard operating systems, tooled with sufficient applicationsoftware and networked in large numbers, desktop systems in the form ofhigh-end personal computers and full-range workstations are taking overenterprises formerly dedicated to building their IS infrastructures onminicomputer platforms.andM;The conclusion is inescapable that PCs and workstations are being thought byIS strategists as much more than glorified typewriters, gee-whiz calculatorsand electronic sketch boards--at the expense of minicomputers.andP;  For the firsttime, in the 16-year history of our annual survey measuring U.S.andP;  users'intentions to buy micro and minicomputers, purchases of minis are expected todecline.andP;  At the same time, investments in PCs, workstations and other keyelements of distributed computing--networks and databases, for example--areon their way up.andM;Just how far down and high up will different market segments go?andP;  Surveyresults indicate that the dollar value of minicomputer shipments will fall10.5% between July 1989 and June 1990.andP;  Monies spent on workstations willclimb 27.3%.andP;  The dollar value of PC shipments is expected to rise 11.3%.andO;Networks linking minicomputers and workstations are set to jump 28%; thosetying PCs are slated to rise a stunning 44%.andP;  Applications for minicomputersand workstations also are on the ascent, as the survey results point to a 19%jump in the dollars spent on database software and a 13% rise in on-linetransaction processing (OLTP) systems purchases.andM;This year's survey, based on the answers to questionnaires sent to 65,000DATAMATION subscribers in the United States, was conducted by Cowen andamp; Co.andO;during late summer.andP;  The Boston-based financial securities firm, whichspecializes in high-technology and biotechnology companies, has performed theMini/Micro survey annually since 1973.andP;  This year's sample of user responses,as in years past, drew from a cross section of U.S.-based users by industry(including government) and geography.andM;Although DATAMATION readers making up this survey do not necessarilyconstitute a scientific sampling of the U.S.andP;  user community, survey resultsare true indicators of the directions IS managers should be leading theirorganizations.andP;  Managers of enterprises that are multi-national or foreign innature, however, should bear in mind that the sample does not measure trendsoutside the United States.andM;What the World Is Coming ToandM;The responses from the 4,700 users that participated in this year's pollreveal a number of far-reaching trends likely to shape the course of the U.S.andO;computer industry--and perhaps the world stage--in 1990 and beyond.andP;  Chiefamong them are:andM;* A dramatic improvement in the health of the U.S.andP;  PC market.andM;* A significant growth in networks and networked-based applications.andM;* Wide use of multiple--not single--PC suppliers for any single userorganization and increased pressure on PC prices.andM;* An allegiance to existing PC standards, with MS/DOS holding its groundagainst OS/2.andM;* A continued dearth of any break-throughs in application software--save,perhaps, in the area of database management--that would propel the industryupward at the clip that Lotus Development Corp.'s Lotus 1-2-3 accelerated thePC industry in its early days.andM;* A rapid consolidation within the ranks of workstation and minicomputersuppliers.andM;* Big gains for UNIX and reduced instruction set computing (RISC), theprocessor architecture most closely associated with its use.andM;The survey also reveals changes in the attitude users are displaying towardtheir suppliers of PCs, workstations and minicomputers.andP;  Of the top threeU.S.-based suppliers of all such systems, IBM fares best on thesurvey--reversing some downward spirals seen on past surveys.andP;  DigitalEquipment Corp. loses ground--due to the absence of a high-end product in itsminicomputer product mix and the newness of its PC and RISC product lines.andO;Unisys Corp. shows slippage nearly across the board--despite being on theright side of UNIX.andM;Here is how some other key suppliers fare:andM;* Compaq Computer Corp., while holding on to its position as the No.andP;  2 PCsupplier (after IBM), faces challenges on pricing, product positioning anddistribution fronts.andM;* Apple Computer Inc. continues to get high grades among PC users for ease ofuse, but its influe ence in PC networks is waning.andM;* Sun Microsystems Inc., despite its inability to predict quarter-to-quarterfinancial performance, exhibits strength in offering customers the featuresthat many believe factor most in future system-purchasing decisions:standards (UNIX), networking and performance.andM;* Hewlett-Packard Co. shows some surprising agility--dodging IBM's AS/400bullet, flexing its peripherals muscle and capturing a fair share of itscustomers' PC business.andP;  But it workstation line (both homegrown andacquired) lacks the kind of muscle expected of the world's No.andP;  1 supplire ofsuch systems.andM;PCs Regain Their StrengthandM;The U.S.andP;  PC market is beginning to flex the sort of muscle it showed beforelast year's weak spell.andP;  The recovery no doubt is due to the 32-bitsemiconductors coming from the likes of Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc., whichare powering today's high-performance PCs.andP;  In last year's survey, usersindicated they would need 5% fewer PCs between July 1988 and June 1989 thanthey had bought in the previous year.andP;  But in this year's tally, they'resaying they intend to buy 3% more PCs by mid-1990 than they bought bymid-1989, which translates into 11% growth in dollars because of the h higherprices for today's PCs.andM;What accounts for the wild swing in PC purchases?andP;  Users were waiting for theright product to come along before they were willing to take desktop systemsinto a new dimension of corporate computing.andP;  That right product appears tobe PCs based on Intel's 80386 32-bit chip.andP;  For example, demand for 80386systems made by Compaq--one of the earliest PC makers to jump on the 32-bitbandwagon--jumps 10 to 1,400 units among users polled in this year's survey.andM;The 80386 chip also claims some responsibility for the phenomenal growth inworkstations detected on this year's survey.andP;  Because the line between PCsand workstations is blurred, the survey counted those 80386-based systemspriced above $7,500 as workstations.andP;  Those below that price were tallied aspersonal computers.andM;The wholesale rush to high-end PCs would seem to bode well for big timeplayers like Compaq and IBM, but the survey results highlight anothersurprising trend: the rise of &quot;others&quot; as important PC suppliers.andP;  &quot;Others,&quot;so christened by researchers because they lack enough market share to beidentified by name, are grabbing greater and greater portions of users' PCunit purchases.andP;  &quot;Others,&quot; like Dell Computer Corp., Everex Systems Inc., NECCorp. and Packard Bell, to name a few, is expected to capture 31% of the PCpurchases made by surveyed users between July 1989 and June 1990--up sevenpoints from the 24% share they held during the last 12 months.andP;  The onlybrand name PC supplier that seems somewhat immune to the &quot;others&quot; invasion isIBM, whose market share actually may increase from 35 to 36% by next June.andM;The &quot;others&quot; phenomenon suggests two important changes in the way IS managersbuy PCs.andP;  First, such managers may actually be seeking more--not fewer--PCsuppliers.andP;  And two, they may be far more concerned with price thancompatibility.andP;  Recent evidence, part anecdotal and part quantitative, pointsto such sweeping changes.andM;American Airlines Inc. recently ordered 50,000 PCs--not from a singlesupplier, but from a trio of them: ATandamp;T, IBM and Tandy Corp.andP;  Although all ofthe PCs purchased by the airline during a two-year period will be based on80386 technology, not all of them will feature the same bus architecture.andO;Some will have the data highway scheme espoused by IBM known as Micro ChannelArchitecture (MCA).andP;  Others will be based on the traditional AdvancedTechnology (AT) bus--known in some circles as the Industry StandardArchitecture (ISA).andP;  And some may b bear the extended version of thatarchitecture, EISA.andM;What PC Buyers WantandM;Price, the chief selling point for &quot;other&quot; PC suppliers, has emerged as thebiggest single criterion used by IS managers in buying PCs in all but threecases.andP;  That's a far cry from as little as three years ago, whenIBM-compatibility ranked as the major concern of PC purchasers.andP;  Then, 24% ofusers mentioned compatibility as an issue; today, barely 10% worry about it.andO;Meanwhile, the price users pay for systems has skyrocketed in importance.andO;More than 30% of users mention it as a major factor in making today's PCinvestments; just 20% listed it as such in 1986.andM;The PC suppliers that so far have managed to compete on the basis ofsomething other than price are Apple, Compaq and HP.andP;  But there's no tellinghow long they will be able to rise above the price wars.andM;Although Apple's Macintosh system is built on proprietary technologyprimarily focused on ease of use, Apple's customers are still very pricesensitive.andP;  In fact, buyers of Macintosh machines in our survey base theirpurchasing decisions on cost nearly as often as they base them on the Mac'ssuperior graphics interface.andP;  This behavior among Apple buyers may explainwhy the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker is losing velocity in one marketbut is picking up speed in another.andP;  This year's survey shows Apple's shareof PC units bought dropping from 8 to 7%, while the number of sites buyingthem is increasing from 7 to 8%.andM;For Compaq, a Texas tornado known to cloud some Big Blue skies in the past,this year's survey hints at a changing weather pattern.andP;  The Houston-basedcompany built its success ($2 billion in annual revenues) and its profits($255 million) on product reputation, not on prices; on PCs, not on otherproducts; on retail distribution, not on direct sales.andP;  And those strategiesprobably will maintain Compaq's forceful presence in the corporatemarketplace--supporting survey data that shows the company holding onto itsshare of several PC market segments.andP;  But for how long?andM;Compaq will be hard pressed to sustain its memontum as users become moreprice sensitive and as &quot;other&quot; suppliers step up their attack of the high endof the PC market--Compaq's domain--with 80386-based PCs of their own.andP;  Forthe moment, Compaq seems to be banking more on its future EISA-based productsthan on anything else to maintain its strength.andP;  Company executives, in fact,seem to have ruled out the possibility of expanding Compaq's distributionchannels beyond third parties like retailers--even though the survey pointsto opportunities for PC suppliers that sell directly to customers like theU.S.andP;  government.andM;Catching the Right PC BusandM;EISA, the bus architecture that IBM-compatible PC makers are pushing, may ormay not be a big hit among major PC users.andP;  Although no EISA-based productsexisted at the time users responded to this year's survey, enough publicityon the subject apparently had been generated to make an impression.andP;  Slightlymore than 15% of surveyed users believe EISA will emerge as the dominantarchitecture for PCs, yet twice as many expect IBM's alternative, MCA, to bethe data path that tops the bus schedule.andM;While the move to a wider bus architecture for 80386-based PCs seems to beunder way, there doesn't seem to be any rush to a new operating system forthose high-performance PCs.andP;  Support for OS/2, the operating systemcodeveloped by Microsoft Corp. and IBM for 80286-based and 80386-basedmachines, is weak at best.andP;  Enthusiasm for OS/2's predecessor, MS/DOS,remains high.andP;  Amazingly, users plan to use MS/DOS 71.4% of the time in thefuture.andP;  If any new PC operating system poses a threat to MS/DOS, it's UNIX.andO;Between our 1988 and 1989 surveys, the number of users who expect to use UNIXfor their PCs jumps from 8.9 to 11.9%, while those who have the their sightsset on OS/2 or OS/2 Extended Edition drops from 18.1 to 16.7%.andM;Do these results bode ill for MS/DOS and OS/2 creator Microsoft?andP;  Well, yesand no.andP;  Yes, in that it means OS/2 may not be raining down buckets ofrevenue on the Redmond, Wash.-based company anytime soon.andP;  No, for tworeasons: MS/DOS royalties keep the company well in the system software chips,and the success of Microsoft's applications software ensures growth.andO;Microsoft's Excel and Multiplan applications, for example, garner nearlytwice as large a share of the PC spreadsheet market in this year's survey asthey did a year ago.andP;  Still, Lotus retains 70% of that market.andM;Microsoft officials expect further growth in applications software, whichlast year accounted for 42% of the company's $803 million in sales.andO;Microsoft is hopeful that a drop in the price of memory chips used in PCswill spur sales of OS/2, a memory-hungry operating system.andP;  Many industryobservers had predicted that the demand for OS/2 would be stimulated by itsPresentation Manager interface, but there's little evidence in the survey tosupport that belief.andP;  PM meets little user friendliness in this year'ssurvey--only 11.5% of prospective OS/2 users intend to use the interface bythe end of 1990.andM;That Presentation Manager and OS/2 are receiving the cold shoulder from usersmay spell trouble for the low end of IBM's System Applications Architecture(SAA) strategy.andP;  OS/2 is one of the key operating systems in the SAA world,the others being positioned in the midrange (OS/400) and the high end (MVSand VM).andP;  Lack of interest in OS/2, if it exists, may be offset in part byIBM's success in networking--a key function if it's to persuade users todevelop SAA applications across a range of computer platforms.andP;  Surveyresults indicate that IBM has 10.2% of the local area network (LAN) marketfor PCs and 19.3% of the market for LANs connecting workstations andminicomputers.andM;IBM's growing presence in mini LANs reflects, in part, the success of itsAS/400 midrange (aka minicomputer) system.andP;  The family of AS/400 products,introduced in June 1988, now accounts for three-quarters of IBM's midrangeshipments to surveyed users.andP;  Moreover, the AS/400 continues to propel IBMupward in the U.S.andP;  minicomputer market.andP;  In the future, 38.5% of userssurveyed say they will regard IBM as their chief minicomputer supplier--upmore than five points from the 33.2% of users who currently regard Big Blueas such.andP;  The largest slice of AS/400 purchase plans continues to be made bycompanies with annual revenues in the $11 million to $250 million range.andO;Interest in the midrange system among bigger companies, though, is alsoincreasing.andP;  Nearly 15% of institutions with revenues above $250 million planto buy an AS/400 this year or next--up from 9% in last year's survey.andO;Surprisingly, support for the AS/400 among small companies--a class of usersspecifically targeted by IBM when it introduced the machine--is down to 5.7%from 6.3%.andM;More astounding is the lift in minicomputer/workstation shipments that IBMseems to be getting from the AS/400 and other products--System 3X, RTworkstations and high-end (model 70 and 80) PS/2s.andP;  In the 12 months thatbegan in July 1989, IBM's share of survey respondents'minicomputer/workstation purchases is expected to soar from 27.8 to 39.4%.andM;The Price of SuccessandM;So who's paying the price for IBM's midrange success?andP;  Evidence in the surveypoints to Digital as the main victim.andP;  And right now the No.andP;  2 computermaker's tab looks steep.andP;  Item A on that bill shows that nearly twice as manyDigital customers are considering purchasing an AS/400 today than they were ayear ago.andP;  But the number still remains small--only 8.6% of prospectiveAS/400 customers today regard Digital as their chief supplier.andP;  Item Bindicates that where an AS/400 is expected to replace a previously installednon-IBM system, Digital systems are the ones getting the boot 19% of thetime--up from 13.5% a year ago.andP;  Item C involves another minicomputer player,as well.andP;  Existing customers of Digital are almost as likely to buy or atleast evaluate an AS/400 as are customers of troubled Wang Laboratories Inc.andM;All of those items add up to market-share troubles for Digital.andP;  Althoughmore users in the survey state that the Maynard, Mass., company will be theirchief minicomputer/workstation supplier in the future (22.7% tomorrow vs.andO;21.4% today), these once and future Digital users plan to spend more moneywith its competitors between July 1989 and June 1990 than they had in theprevious 12 months.andP;  Consequently, Digital's share of systems purchases isexpected to decline to 31.9%, down from 40.5% a year ago.andM;Digital's own product line, as much as competition from anyone else's, couldaccount for the tumble.andP;  When the survey was taken, the company lacked ahigh-end system capable of generating big revenue gains.andP;  It also had justintroduced a revamped 6000 series of minicomputers about which surveyrespondents probably knew very little.andP;  And the product line that users couldevaluate in 1989 differs markedly from the one they saw in 1988.andP;  It containsa lot more workstations, whose prices fetch fewer dollars per system thantheir older minicomputer predecessors.andM;The survey does, however, point to some areas where Digital may be exacting aprice from others.andP;  In the OLTP system market, where minicomputers andmainframe systems are used heavily, Digital's share jumps from 5.8 to 14.8%.andO;In database software, its position improves from 7 to 7.3%.andP;  Inminicomputer/workstation networks, Digital's connections rise from 12.7 to19.3%.andP;  And in PC LANs, they go from 4.1 to 5.9%.andP;  However, in almost all ofthese cases, Digital is taking market share away from less-establishedplayers--not from the leaders.andM;The RISC Takers: HP andamp; SunandM;Unlike Digital, which seems to be the current target of IBM's AS/400 cannon,Hewlett-Packard has moved out of IBM's range.andP;  Fewer than 3% of its customers(including those of Apollo Computer Inc., which HP purchased in April) planto replace HP systems with AS/400s.andP;  The reason appears to be Spectrum, theline of minicomputers based on RISC technology that the Palo Alto computermaker began shipping in August 1987.andP;  The machines are capable of running aversion of HP's homegrown MPE operating system and/or the company's versionof UNIX.andP;  The success of the Spectrum line and the ability for HP to supplyits customers with PCs seems to be rubbing off on the company's peripheralsbusiness.andP;  HP leads all others in supplying users in the survey with laserprinters and 100+ megabyte hard disk drives.andM;HP, however, faces the same challenge confronting Digital: how to maintain orimprove the share of midrange system dollars spent by users with a productline increasingly dominated by lower priced systems--i.e., workstations.andO;Little else can explain why increasing numbers of customers regard HP, likeDigital, as their chief supplier of minicomputers and workstations, whilethose same customers expect to spend fewer of their dollars on futurepurchases of such systems.andM;The supplier most responsible for pushing minicomputer and workstation priceslower and lower is, itself, experiencing the same effects as HP and Digital.andO;Sun, too, is gaining customers: 5.6% of users in the survey will consider theMountain View, Calif.andP;  company their chief supplier in the future, up fromthe 4.1% of all users who worship Sun today.andP;  But in terms of dollar-basedfuture purchases of systems, the survey indicates that Sun's market sharewill drop from 10.7 to 9.6%.andP;  The reason again has mostly to do with productlines.andP;  Sun has introduced an aggressively priced new family of products,SPARCstations, that's eating into demand for its higher priced workstations.andM;There are, indeed, clouds for Sun in this year's survey.andP;  Loyalty among Suncustomers remains below industry average--somewhat of a surprise given theprice/performance benefits delivered by the workstation maker.andP;  Data GeneralCorp. and Unisys also get lower marks from their customers.andP;  Another cloud isDigital, which is the closest runner-up to Sun at customer sites where Sunwins orders.andP;  The competition between Sun and Digital should be even tighternow that Digital is offering a RISC product line.andM;Looking on the bright side for Sun, it seems well positioned in a number ofhigh-growth areas and applications.andP;  On the commercial side of IS, forinstance, Sun has a growing following.andP;  Nearly one out of four Sun users inthe survey employs Sun's workstations in office or IS applications--small incomparison with those using its machines for technical applications, butsubstantial just the same.andP;  Sun also gets the highest grades of any supplierfor LAN server applications, a key component in the evolving world ofdistributed processing.andP;  Most telling, perhaps, is the fact that customers inthe survey buy Sun systems for all of the reasons experts believe will rightthe worldwide computer industry on its course in the 1990s: processorperformance (RISC), networking capabilities and strong UNIX standards.andM;Sun, of course, isn't alone in building products around such features.andO;Almost all of the traditional minicomputer manufacturers are doing the same.andO;Data General and Unisys, in particular, are emphasizing the performance oftheir open product lines.andP;  Whether the rush to RISC, UNIX and networkingstandards will shore up the sagging market share of such companies remains tobe seen.andP;  They, like other traditional minicomputer suppliers Prime ComputerInc. and Wang, are falling further behind leaders IBM, DEC, HP and Sun inthis year's survey.andP;  More disconcerting for such lagging suppliers is thatmore minicomputer/workstation users in this year's survey contemplateswitching chief suppliers than in the previous four surveys.andM;New Styles for New TimesandM;The biggest shift evident among minicomputer users in this year's surveyisn't, however, from one supplier to another.andP;  It's from one style ofcomputing to another.andP;  The traditional proprietary operating systems runningon complex instruction set computing architectures are giving way to the openworld that ATandamp;T HP and Sun are making so much noise about.andP;  It's an era whereusers harness the power of RISC technology and the availability ofapplications software written to a standard (UNIX).andP;  And it appears to be anera quickly dawning for users in this year's survey.andM;One out of five user organizations in the survey intends to make UNIX itsprimary operating system for commercial applications in the future; two outof five technical users have such intentions.andP;  Both figures are up sharplyfrom last year's survey, although users seem hardly more knowledgeable aboutwhich version of UNIX they'll bet their IS shops on.andP;  Nearly half of allusers in this year's survey say they don't know whether UNIX InternationalInc.' version of the operating system will win out over the Open SoftwareFoundation's UNIX model.andP;  Among the remaining half of survey respondents,however, UNIX International has pulled decidedly ahead of OSF as the odds-onfavorite to win the UNIX battle.andM;RISC, meanwhile, seems to be victorious over complex instruction setcomputing (CISC) in the contest for systems architectures.andP;  Almost a third ofall users see reducing the number of instructions needed to make a processorwork as the way to go in minicomputers; barely a sixth of them thought so ayear ago.andP;  And workstation users pledge even greater allegiance to RISC.andM;What RISC, UNIX and the multitude of other changes afoot in this year'ssurvey imply for IS managers is that the purchasing decisions made today willhave a broad impact on their organizations--immediately and down the road.andP;  Amisstep into the new dimension of desktop computing could be costly.andP;  No stepinto it all, however, could be far more expensive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
