The verdict was in response to a lawsuit filed against FirstSouth in late 1984 by six financial institutions that the thrift didn't identify. The suit seeks $11 million in damages, plus punitive damages, but the court hasn't yet determined the amount of damages it will award the plaintiffs, according to FirstSouth.    FirstSouth, which has about $1.7 billion in assets, said Judge David Bogard found FirstSouth guilty of fraud because it neglected to disclose certain facts related to the commercial property on which it made the loan and misrepresented certain other facts to two of the plaintiffs in the suit. The plaintiffs were participants in the mortgage loan. The loan defaulted and FirstSouth bought the real estate in a foreclosure sale in July 1985.    The verdict is the latest in a series of problems that have plagued the thrift this year. Last month it signed a consent agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board authorizing the board to negotiate, among other things, a possible merger or reorganization or to appoint a conservator. In August its chairman, Del E. Brannon, retired and its president, Roderick D. Reed, resigned. In July, the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating trading in its stock.    The thrift said its attorneys are studying the court's ruling in order to determine whether to appeal. FirstSouth officials couldn't be reached to elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
