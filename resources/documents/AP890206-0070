In Jerusalem, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on themain shopping street of the city's Arab sector to disperse severaldozen Palestinian stone-throwers who smashed cars and shop windows.A teen-ager was reported injured.   ``Two days ago, we had an example of a terrorist act by a branchof the PLO,'' Arens said in a speech to the New York-basedConference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.   He cited a clash Saturday in which Israeli troops killed fivePalestinian fighters on the northern border of Israel'sself-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.   The radical PLO factions of George Habash's Marxist Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian-backed PalestinianLiberation Front said their guerrillas were on a mission to attackIsraeli positions.   Arens said the action ``clearly and unequivocally violated'' U.S.conditions for opening talks with the PLO after a 13-year boycott.   ``I presume that in Washington, they also noticed what happened.But, to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed, we willdraw his attention to it,'' Arens added on Israel Radio, after thespeech.   A Foreign Ministry official later said, ``Israel is calling onthe United States to reconsider the dialogue considering that thePLO, the Habash faction, took responsibility for the attempt topenetrate Israel.''   U.S. officials shocked Israel by opening talks with the PLO inDecember after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism andsaid he accepted Israel.   Israel argues the PLO has not changed its objective of destroyingthe Jewish state. Israeli officials note Arafat's mainstream Fatahfaction has refrained from attacks but express doubt that Arafat cancontrol other, more militant PLO factions.   Seymour Reich, head of the Jewish conference of presidents, saidhe, too, would pressure the Bush administration to end contacts withthe PLO.   ``I'm not sure the administration is prepared to cut off thedialogue yet,'' Reich said on Israel Radio. ``But we're going topress them on these issues and remind them that ... these terroristacts are continuing.''   In a speech Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israelwould never allow a Palestinian state to exist and brandedPalestinian people ``brutal, wild, alien invaders in the land ofIsrael.''   In the occupied territories, meanwhile, Israeli troops today shota 15-year-old Palestinian girl in the thigh, Arab hospital officialssaid. Gaza Strip residents were on strike for a second day toprotest the deaths Saturday of two Palestinian youths shot inclashes with troops. Merchants shuttered their shops and studentswent home.   The army said it was checking the report about the girl's injury.   Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, 373 Palestiniansand 15 Israelis have been killed.</TEXT></DOC>
