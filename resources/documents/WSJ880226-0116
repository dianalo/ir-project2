Dukakis hopes to beat the pack Super Tuesday, winning about 200 Southern delegates after focusing on Florida, Texas and North Carolina, plus nearly half the 383 delegates elected outside the South. Gephardt and Gore are in a tough struggle, with Gephardt ahead in the oil patch and Gore in states adjoining Tennessee. Jackson will win three or four states and roll up delegates.    With the contests so close, they will get nastier. Dukakis plans to attack Gephardt for taking special-interest money. &quot;Gephardt says he's fighting your fight, but he's fighting it with their money,&quot; a Dukakis aide charges. Gore steps up attacks on the Missouri congressman's alleged inconsistencies.    Gephardt is holding 26 fund-raisers in the last three weeks before Super Tuesday, but he still trails Dukakis and Gore in financing. One strategist counters: &quot;Our message is worth more than their money.&quot;    BUDGET BATTLES will intensify under new spending limitations.    The biggest fight on nonmilitary spending will be over space. Reagan proposes a 20% increase next fiscal year, but the House wants that money for other programs. &quot;We're spending more for homes in space than for the homeless here on earth,&quot; Budget Chairman Gray complains. Fights also brew over Reagan proposals to cut urban grants and transportation.    On the military side, advocates will push to restore pet projects. Massachusetts Rep. Mavroules wants more M-1 tanks than the Army asked for. Grumman Corp. lobbies for its A-6F fighter jet, which the Navy wants to drop. The squeeze will tighten; Pentagon budgeteers say $37 billion will have to be cut from the planned defense program for 1990 and $41.3 billion from 1991's.    DOUBTS GROW that Reagan can wrap up a long-range missile agreement.    Despite official optimism, some White House aides are increasingly skeptical privately that verification problems can be solved before Reagan leaves office. An aide worries that officials who &quot;want peace to break out&quot; are building unrealistic expectations. Some advisers suggest a &quot;framework&quot; deal with the Soviets, leaving the final treaty for the next president.    Though the administration has criticized such setups in the past, it might accept one this time, some experts say. &quot;The two reasons are George Shultz and Ronald Reagan,&quot; says former national security adviser Scowcroft. &quot;Both of them want as much as they can get before they leave the scene.&quot;    But Shultz and White House Chief of Staff Baker continue to insist that a strategic-arms pact can be achieved.    PAC POPULIST? Gephardt accepts more than $300,000 from political-action committees, the most by far of any Democratic presidential candidate. Gifts flow from commodity brokers, Wall Street houses, developers, insurance firms, Pentagon suppliers, oil companies and labor unions, including the Teamsters.    OFF-THE-WALL CLAIMS by Robertson -- that the Soviets have missiles in Cuba, that his people knew the location of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, that Bush leaked the Swaggert scandal -- puzzle political analysts. They say the remarks may doom any chance of attracting mainstream conservatives. One theory is that his assertions are aimed at mobilizing core constituents.    DUKE THE GREEK: Dukakis's campaign draws enthusiastic attention in his parents' homeland of Greece. His primary successes rate big headlines there, and a rally for him is set for Sunday in Athens. As for potential voters, the U.S. Consulate says 30,000 American citizens live in Greece.    CIA SHAKE-UPS spread under Webster. The head of the Central America Task Force quits after refusing a transfer, the Counterterrorism Center chief will leave soon and a third official is quietly transferred. All were reprimanded in the Iran-Contra scandal. &quot;This is Webster's style,&quot; says one intelligence official. &quot;He moves quietly but he means business.&quot;    HIGH-COURT CASES will increasingly turn on newcomer Kennedy's role.    He will take part in several decisions this term, including whether cities may ban private men-only clubs. His vote could break 44 ties in some cases. But he decides not to participate in perhaps the term's most important ruling: on the validity of the independent-counsel law.    Kennedy's impact will grow next term, when the court takes up the affirmative-action power of cities and other key cases. Liberals and moderates hope his approach will resemble that of predecessor Powell, who was the swing vote on affirmative action. But they are concerned at his hiring of a law clerk who was a conservative White House lawyer and former clerk for Bork.    Noting that Kennedy didn't take part in court decisions just announced, Justice Blackmun teased, &quot;We haven't been able to get a lick of work out of him.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: The Chicago Tribune sends presidential candidates a survey. One question: &quot;What's your favorite trashy novel?&quot; . . . Comedian Mark Russell describes embattled Edwin Meese &quot;as a one-man growth industry for lawyers.&quot; . . . Two environmental groups invite congressmen to a Capitol buffet. Main course: poached toxics -- contaminated fish from the Great Lakes. </TEXT></DOC>
