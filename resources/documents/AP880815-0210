Smaller fires were being fought in Idaho, Oregon and Utah, andofficials said hot, dry weather played a role in most.   ``We have engines at every homesite or building that is indanger,'' Lame Deer, Mont., fire information officer Jerry Chapmansaid of the 6,000-acre blaze on the northern Cheyenne IndianReservation in the southeastern part of the state.   Six to eight structures were in the fire's path, he said.Bulldozers and road graders were used to clear debris and crewsburned fire lines around the homes to save them.   With temperatures in the 90s and winds of 10 mph to 20 mph,flames shot right up to the yards around two homes on the main roadup the South Fork of Lame Deer Creek.   Chapman said some residents left their homes temporarily. Noinjuries were reported.   At Yellowstone, spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said a road at thepark's west entrance was closed Monday afternoon, althoughofficials expected it to reopen later in the day. It was the secondroad closed Monday.   Earlier, the road to the Old Faithful Geyser also was closedbecause of low visibility caused by smoke from the 52,960-acre.   High winds pushed the fire toward the park's main roadway Mondayafternoon, Vanderbilt said.   The hot, dry weather feeding the Yellowstone fires, also fueleda number of new lightning fires in northwestern and southeasternWyoming.   And in Idaho, high winds and no precipitation prompted Nez PerceNational Forest officials to postpone trying to control the2,175-acre Ruby Rapids fire on the Main Salmon River.   Both the Nez Perce and the Payette forests in west-central Idahoexpected another round of dry lightning storms to ignite even moreblazes.   In the Nez Perce National Forest, about 300 firefighters werebattling nearly 50 blazes, most of them 10 acres or less. Lightningin the last three days continued to spark fires as officialscontended with dwindling manpower and equipment.   Oregon fire officials contained a 50-acre fire Sunday as a waveof thunderstorms brought the threat of more fires to parchedcentral and Eastern Oregon.   And in Utah, crews completed fire lines around a 900-acre blazeon the Ute Indian Reservation.</TEXT></DOC>
