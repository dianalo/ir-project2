He's just so homespun.&quot; The Canton, Ohio, office manager will return to the Democratic fold this year.    Her Republican neighbor, Paul Blohm, a 59-year-old insurance adjuster, saw the same thing on television this week and was concerned for his party. &quot;I would only hope the Republicans are able to come through with as big a show as the Democrats,&quot; he said.    If these voters have found any common ground as the fall presidential campaign gets under way, it is that the Democrats have achieved some degree of unity after years of disarray. That's what Mrs. Rohrer, Mr. Blohm and 10 of their neighbors said after watching this week's convention on television. The dozen Ohio voters have been periodically interviewed by The Wall Street Journal for more than a year to track their impressions of the progress of the 1988 presidential election.    While they are far too small a sampling to be any gauge of overall public opinion, they do provide an in-depth reaction from voters whose views are by now well-known. Moreover, pollster Peter Hart conducted about 250 telephone interviews for The Wall Street Journal during the four days of the convention -- again a sample too small to be scientific -- and came up with the same impressions. A more scientific poll by ABC News yesterday showed Mr. Dukakis did get a &quot;bounce&quot; out of the Democratic convention. The ABC survey of registered voters showed Mr. Dukakis leading Vice President George Bush, the apparent Republican candidate, 53% to 41% after running even with him only three days earlier.    &quot;I was impressed by all the camaraderie and unity,&quot; Democrat Phyllis Sacqynski, a New Jersey truck dispatcher, told Mr. Hart. &quot;I'm impressed with Dukakis's ability to pull everyone together,&quot; added Aaron Galland, a Democrat and farmer from Mr. Dukakis's home state, Massachusetts. &quot;I liked the overall sense of unity.&quot;    The Ohio voters were impressed with Mr. Dukakis after watching his acceptance speech last night. Mary Pat Blubaugh, a 60-year-old Republican housewife, said she was &quot;impressed, more impressed with Dukakis than I thought I would be. He's very warm, he oozes integrity.&quot;    While most of the Republicans in the Journal's Ohio group said they didn't plan to convert to the Democratic side, the convention helped to confirm Reagan Democrat Ms. Rohrer's decision to return to the party. It also firmed up the decision of Republican Robert Rath, whose wife is Greek, to vote for the first Greek-American Democratic candidate. &quot;I think they got a good start because they got everything together,&quot; said Mr. Rath.    Most of the Ohio voters, who differ widely in their opinions of the Democratic and Republican candidates, agreed that the four-day extravaganza meant good news for the Democrats and bad news for the GOP. &quot;I'm probably a little more concerned. I'm not as confident as I was before the convention,&quot; said Christina Gumpp, 32, a Republican who works as a jewelry sales clerk. Democrat Brent Burton, 37, who drives a beer truck, was pleasantly surprised. &quot;They aren't bad-rapping each other the way they usually do,&quot; he said.    The Ohio voters said they expect the election in November to be close because they believe Democrats who voted for Mr. Reagan last time, and poor minority voters who were galvanized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, will swell the Democratic Party's ranks.    &quot;I think we're getting some back that we lost,&quot; concluded Stephen Geier, a 48-year-old laborer who watched the third night of the convention from the hospital, where his first grandchild was being born. &quot;I would say if the unity keeps up as it is, we're going to win.&quot;    While some complained that Mr. Jackson stole the show, most of the Canton group felt that Mr. Dukakis was skillful in his handling of Mr. Jackson. &quot;Sometimes you wonder who the presidential nominee is,&quot; complained Albert Manzella, a 61-year-old Democrat and retired utility company credit manager on the third day of the convention. &quot;But I think Dukakis ended up looking good. If you're president you've got to work with other people regardless.&quot; Last year, Mr. Manzella felt that Mr. Dukakis &quot;didn't project to me like someone I would trust,&quot; but that's changed now, he said.    Fellow Democrat James Frutschy, the 38-year-old audio-visual director for Canton's Pro Football Hall of Fame, was concerned this spring about Mr. Dukakis's ability to negotiate with Mr. Jackson. &quot;The fact that Mr. Dukakis has not really embraced Jesse Jackson totally and the fact that he was able to control the platform means to me that he's the man in control,&quot; he said this week.    Even ardent Republican Dennis Fulmer, a 34-year-old portfolio manager, concluded: &quot;'I kind of think more of Dukakis because of the way in general he didn't try to placate Jackson to a large degree. He didn't rush out to meet him or to apologize or anything.&quot;    After watching Mr. Jackson largely dominate the convention for the first two days, most of these voters were pleased to finally get on to the main event: Mr. Dukakis. Some were impressed; others weren't sure they believed what they saw.    &quot;I didn't realize he was so frugal,&quot; said Ms. Rohrer, who is an administrative assistant at an investment management firm. While she'll vote for him because she doesn't like Mr. Bush, this Reagan Democrat found it a bit &quot;comical&quot; that such personal quirks as mowing his own lawn were cited as evidence that Mr. Dukakis will be a good president.    Most of these Ohio voters said that Mr. Jackson impressed them with his passionate speech, but they want his role in the campaign carefully defined. &quot;Jackson's had his shots, and now it's got to be the Dukakis show,&quot; said Mr. Manzella, a Democrat. Concluded Republican Mr. Blohm after Mr. Jackson's speech: &quot;They're going to have to stifle him some.&quot;    The soundings taken this week by Mr. Hart suggested that the convention generally helped the party among those who identify themselves as Democrats. &quot;I wasn't impressed by them at first, but after watching the convention my thoughts have changed to positive for the Democratic party,&quot; said a Democratic realtor from Pennsylvania.    &quot;They are trying to do the things I want them to, like looking after the middle class,&quot; a North Carolina truck driver, a Democrat, concluded after watching two days of convention proceedings. Added a Virgina plumber: &quot;They seem to know what they are doing this time like never before.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
