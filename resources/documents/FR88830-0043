This notice announced proposed findings by the Scientific Authority andManagement Authority of the United States on the export of bobcat harvestedin the 1988 and subsequent years on the Wind River Indian Reservation,Wyoming, by enrolled members of the Arapahoe and Shoshone Tribes. Theseproposed findings also stipulate that monitoring procedures previouslyestablished for other States and Indian tribes be extended to include WindRiver Indian Reservation, Wyoming.

On March 24, 1988(53 FR 9631), Kentucky and the White Mountain Apache Tribe were added tothis list of approved export States. The purpose of this proposed ruleis to add the Wind River Indian Reservation, Wyoming, to the list of Stateand Indian Nations for which the export of bobcats is approved. The Convention regulates import, export, reexport, and introduction fromthe sea of certain animal and plant species. Species for which trade iscontrolled are included in three appendices. Appendix I includes speciesthreatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. AppendixII includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with extinctionmay become so unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also listsspecies that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in othercurrently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effectivecontrol (e.g., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of currentlyor potentially threatened species from those of other listed species).Appendix III includes native species that any Party nation identified asbeing subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for purposes of preventingor restricting exploitation, and for which it needs the cooperation ofother Parties in controlling trade. In the January 5, 1984, and the August 18, 1983 (48 FR 37494) <T4>Federal Register </T4>documents, the Service announced the decisionfrom a review of listed species concluded at the Fourth Meeting of theConference of the Parties in Botswana that each of the species or geographicallyseparate populations including the bobcat, should be regarded as listedin Appendix II because of its similarity in appearance to other listedspecies or populations. As indicated in those documents, the Conferenceof the Parties adopted a resolution accepting the report of the CentralCommittee on the 10-year review of species listed in Appendices I and II.The report included recommendations that these populations ro species shouldbe considered as listed in Appendix II only because of similarity in appearance,if they were to be retained in that appendix. The January 5, 1984, document described how the Service, as ScientificAuthority, planned to monitor the status of these species and their tradeon an annual basis so that it could detect any significant downward trendsin populations and, where necessary, institute more restrictive exportcontrols in response to them. The document also described how the Services,as Management Authority, would determine if specimens had been lawfullyacquired on the basis of tagging requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scientific Authority Findings </ITAG>Article IV of the Convention requires that an export permit for any specimenof a species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certainfindings have been made by the Scientific Authority and Management Authorityof the exporting country. The Scientific Authority must advise ``that suchexport will not be detrimental to the survival of that species'' beforea permit can be granted by the Management Authority. The Scientific Authority for the United States must develop such adviceon non-detriment for the export of Appendix II animals in accordance withandSection;1537(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (the Act), asamended. The Act states that the Secretary of the Interior is requiredto base export determinations and advice ``upon the best available biologicalinformation derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practicesbut is not required to make, or require any State to make, estimates ofpopulation size in making such determinations or giving such advice.''The bobcat is managed by the wildlife agencies of individual States andIndian Tribes and Nations. Those States and Indian Nations from which theServices has approved the export of bobcats in the 1983-84 and subsequenttaking seasons were identified in the January 5, 1984, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(49 FR 590), and the March 24, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 9631), and listed in 50 CFR 23.52. Eachexport-approved State or Indian Tribe or Nation in which this animal isharvested has a program to regulate the harvest. Based on information receivedfrom the Wind River Indian Reservation, Wyoming, the Service proposes addingthat Indian Reservation to those States and Indian Reservation and Nationsfrom which bobcat export is approved by the Service. Consistent with the determination that the bobcat is listed to enable tradein other species to be effectively controlled, the Scientific Authorityconsiders this control aspect when advising on non-detriment. Marking ofpelts with tags bearing the country and State of origin, year of harvest,name of the species, a unique serial number, and the issuance of exportpermits naming the species being traded is sufficient to address problemsof identification due to similarity in appearance between bobcats and otherspecies (see Management Authority findings for tag specification). In addition to considering the effect of trade on species or populationsother than those being exported from the United States, the Service willmonitor the status of the bobcat managed by the Wind River Indian Reservation,Wyoming, to (1) determine whether treatment of these furbearers, listedbecause of similarity in appearance, remains appropriate, and (2) detectany significant downward trends in the population and, where necessary,advise on more restrictive export controls in response to them. This monitoringand assessment will follow the same procedures adopted for other Statesand Indian Tribes and Nations (see 49 FR 590). As part of this monitoringprogram, the States and Indian Tribes and Nations that have been approvedfor export of bobcats are annually requested to certify that the harvestof bobcats will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and toprovide data and/or the basis for support of this assessment. A determinationcan be made about the treatment of this species and whether a managementprogram needs to be adjusted in a particular State, Indian Tribe or Nationby a review of available information and accumulated data by the Officeof Scientific Authority. Scientific Authority guidelines developed for bobcat export under the provisionsof Convention Article II.2(a), which represent professionally-acceptedwildlife management practices, are presented in more detail in the August18, 1983, <T4>Federal Register </T4>document (48 FR 37494). These guidelines aresummarized as follows: A. Minimum requirements for biological information: (1) Information on the condition of the population, including trends (themethod of determination to be a matter of State, Indian Tribe or Nation'schoice), and population estimates where such information is available;(2) Information on total harvest of the species; (3) Information on distribution of harvest; and (4) Habitat evaluation. B. Minimum requirements for a management program: (1) There should be a controlled harvest, methods and seasons to be a matterof State, Indian Tribe, or Nation's choice; (2) All skins should be registered and marked; and (3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State,Indian Tribe or Nation. The Wind River Indian Reservation, Wyoming, has provided population estimatesbased on the relationship between population density from other studiesin the State and habitat types and distribution on the Reservation. Thisinformation has been supplemented with data on reproductive rates and agestructure of the population obtained from harvested bobcats, and with relativenumber of bobcats trapped per trapping effort.Bobcat harvest on the Wind River Indian Reservation is limited to enrolledmembers of the Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes who must attach a tribal tabto the bobcat pelt immediately at take. Under an interagency agreementbetween the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,the Service oversees the wildlife program on the Wind River Indian Reservation.Wind River Agency game wardens monitor and control actual hunting and trappingactivities and will replace tribal tags with Convention export tags beforethe bobcat pelt ownership is transferred or the pelt leaves the Reservation.Based upon information presented by the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming,including Reservation Agency bobcat regulations, and in consideration ofthe basis for the species' listing in Appendix II of the Convention, theService proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice in favor of exportof bobcats harvested in 1988 and subsequent harvest seasons from Wind RiverReservation, Wyoming.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Authority Findings</ITAG>Exports of Appendix II species are be allowed under the Convention onlyif the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens were not obtainedin contravention of laws for the protection of the involved species. TheService, therefore, must be satisfied that the bobcat pelts, hides, orproducts being exported were not obtained in violation of State, IndianTribal or Nation, or Federal law in order to allow export. Evidence oflegal taking for Alaskan gray wolf, Alaskan brown or grizzly bear, Americanalligator, bobcat, lynx, and river otter is provided by State and IndianTribe or Nation tagging programs. The Service annually contracts for themanufacture and delivery of special Convention animal-hide tags for export-qualifiedStates and Indian Nations. The Service has adopted the following ManagementAuthority export guidelines for the 1983-84 and subsequent taking seasons:(1) Current State and Tribe or Nation hunting, trapping and tagging regulationsand sample tags must be on file with the Office of Management Authority;(2) The tags must be durable and permanently locking, and must show U.S.-CITESlogo, State and Indian Tribe or Nation of origin, year of take, species,and be serially unique;(3) The tag must be applied to all pelts taken within a minimum time aftertake, as specified by the State and Indian Tribe or Nation, and such timeshould be as short as possible to minimize movement of untagged pelts;(4) The tag must be permanently attached as authorized and prescribed bythe State and Indian Tribe or Nation;(5) State and Indian Tribe or Nation registered-dealers or State and IndianTribe, or Nation-licensed takers allowed to attach export tags must accountfor tags received and must return unused tags to the State or Indian Tribeor Nation within a specified time after taking season closes; and,(6) Fully manufactured fur (or hide) products may be exported from theUnited States only when the Convention export tags, removed from the hidesused to manufacture the product being exported, are surrendered to theService prior to export.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Export Decision</ITAG>The Service proposes to approve exports of Wind River Indian Reservationbobcats harvested in the 1988 and subsequent harvest seasons on the groundsthat both Scientific Authority and Management Authority guidelines aresatisfied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service requests comments on these proposed findings. Final findingswill take into consideration the comments and any additional informationreceived, and such consideration might lead to final findings that differfrom this proposal.The proposal is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The authors are S Ronald Singer,Office of Management Authority, and Dr. Charles W. Dane, Office of ScientificAuthority.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> The Department has previously determined that the exportof bobcats of various States and Indian Tribes or Nations, taken in the1983-1984 and subsequent harvest seasons, was not a major Federal actionthat would significantly affect the quality of the human environment withinthe meaning of Section 102(1)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Actand, therefore, the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement wasnot required (48 FR 37494). Because these proposed findings do not significantlydiffer from the previous export findings, the previous determination notto prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on export of bobcats takenduring the 1983-1984 and subsequent harvest seasons in certain States (49FR 590) remains appropriate. The Department has also previously determinedthat such harvest was not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 anddid not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). Because theexisting rule treats exports on a State-by-State and Indian Nation-by-IndianNation basis and proposes to approve export in accordance with a Stateor Indian Nation management program, the rule will have little effect onsmall entities in and of itself. This proposed rule does not contain anyinformation collection requirements that require approval by the Officeof Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23</ITAG>Endangered and threatened wildlife, Exports, Fish, Imports, Plants (agriculture),Treaties.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION</ITAG>Accordingly, the Service proposes to amend part 23 of Title 50, Code ofFederal Regulations, as set forth below:1.
