John A. Schnittker, a Washington-based consultant, said thebreakup in Brussels last week of the four-year-old Uruguay Round ofnegotiations put the talks ``about where we expected,'' with littleprospect of a deal unless the two sides back off in their bitterdispute over farm subsidies.   Some believe the talks will resume after some weeks of coolingoff, possibly next month in Geneva.   As it stood when the talks were suspended, the United States andthe Cairns Group of nations - which includes Australia, Argentina,Uruguay and others - wanted cuts of 75 percent in internal pricesupports and market barriers, and 90 percent reductions in exportsubsidies over a 10-year period.   The European Community refused, saying such cuts would forcemore than 20 percent of its 10 million farmers from the land.   Schnittker and economist William H. Meyers of Iowa StateUniversity commented on a report they and Dermot Hays, another IowaState economist, had written for a professional journal, in whichthey argued the United States would be served by lowering itssights on the subsidy issue.   The article in Choices, published by the American AgriculturalEconomics Association, contended that ``political flexibility inthe EC is very limited'' and that it might be best to settle forwhatever new offer - provided there is real movement - the bloc islikely to make.   ``It is more important, in our view, to bind the maximumconcessions the EC is willing to make by the end of February -assuming they will go somewhat beyond their standing offer - thanit is to ensure deep subsidy and tariff reductions,'' Schnittkersaid.   If not, he added, failure of the talks ``would leave the U.S.cutting farm subsidies unilaterally, while we cannot be sure thatEurope and Japan will be forced by internal pressures to followsuit.''   Further, he said, ``Substantial trade gains would accrue to theU.S. and Cairns Group countries from a deal only slightly beyondpresent EC offers.''   Members of the EC include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Spainand Portugal.</TEXT></DOC>
