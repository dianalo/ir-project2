Kaufman's Dec. 19Counterpoint column &quot;Where Christmas Belongs&quot;:   It appears from his article that Judge Kaufman would turnthe constitutional freedom of religion into freedom fromreligion. It is interesting that the judge, in trying to makea case for his position, turns to the beliefs and practicesof early Colonial times rather than those of the Framers ofthe Constitution. History testifies that it was not thelatter's intent to remove all mention of God from publicaffairs. In the Declaration of Independence the Foundersappealed to God. Would Judge Kaufman have these referencesdeleted? If we want an example of what happens to a nationthat attempts to exclude God completely from its public life,we need only turn to the now-disintegrating U.S.S.R.</LP><TEXT>   Jerome R. Johnson   Havre de Grace, Md.   ---   Some of the things Judge Kaufman mentions, such as soaringpoverty rates, the increase of working mothers, racialtensions, inter alia, are fueling the return to religiousvalues by so many Americans. Americans of multicultures havecome to realize that the state and federal governments cannoteffectively legislate solutions to what are ostensivelycommunity issues.   He expresses misgivings for the infusion of &quot;a newlyreligious tone&quot; in lawmaking. His concern is misdirected.Ethics and morality have always been the basis forestablishing society's laws. The current social climate ofepidemic greed and misfeasance among corporate managers andgovernment officials, deleterious to society and the economy,has the American public searching for social-behavior safetyvalves.   &quot;Leaders&quot; in a democratic society are those who understandthe role of religion as a means of establishing social, moraland ethical behavior. Laws that establish religion orprohibit its free exercise are to be identified as such andaggressively challenged, just as laws that respectestablished religions and protect the free exercise of thosereligious beliefs are to be courageously enacted andvalidated.   Kim Clark   Berkeley, Calif.   ---   Judge Kaufman's apprehension that religious concepts maybe improperly intruding into governmental functions is, Ibelieve, largely unfounded. The U.S. is in no danger ofbecoming a theocracy.   However, the views he states contain a very ironic aspect.In 1951, when he was a federal trial judge in New York, herevealed that he had sought the advice of a rabbi withrespect to imposing the death penalty upon Julius and EthelRosenberg, the so-called &quot;atom spies.&quot;   Under the criteria delineated in his column, such actionwould appear to merit severe condemnation.   Edward F. Cummerford   Sun City, Ariz.   ---   Don't you think that it is a stretch, even for a liberalTruman appointee, to believe that a return to the Salem witchtrials is imminent because a group of 18-year-old kids andtheir parents invoked the name of God at a graduationceremony?   Realizing the quality of the skills that they had acquiredafter 13 years of unionized-teacher instruction, I'm surethey were just playing it safe and asking for help anywherethey could get it.
