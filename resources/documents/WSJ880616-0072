Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> T.FCY BSC </CO><IN> SCR STK </IN><G> JUS SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal court ruled that First City Financial Corp. and its vice president, Marc Belzberg, &quot;parked&quot; stock with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. to evade disclosing its stake in Ashland Oil Inc.    The federal district court here ordered First City and Mr. Belzberg to disgorge $2.7 million in trading profit.    Gary Lynch, the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement chief, said he believes this is the first case in which a court has ordered disgorgement of profit arising from a violation of Section 13D of the Securities Exchange Act, which requires disclosure of an acquisition of more than 5% of a company's securities within 10 days of the acquisition.    &quot;This sets a very important precedent for us on 13D cases,&quot; Mr. Lynch said. &quot;The court accepted our argument that someone who violates 13D through secret accumulation of stock should be required to disgorge those profits, just as they should for other securities-law violations,&quot; such as &quot;insider trading.&quot;    Mr. Lynch declined to say why Bear Stearns wasn't charged in the civil case. The brokerage firm didn't have any immediate comment. The firm's chairman and chief executive officer, Alan &quot;Ace&quot; Greenberg, who the court found had purchased Ashland stock at the behest of First City, couldn't be reached for comment.    First City said in a statement, &quot;We are deeply disappointed by the court's decision. We fought the case because we believed the SEC was wrong on the facts and the law. We still believe that, and we intend to appeal.&quot;    Mr. Belzberg couldn't be reached. His legal team, which includes Arthur Liman, best known as chief counsel for the Senate committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, declined to comment.    The SEC case marks the second legal setback to the Belzberg family arising from their unsuccessful $1.8 billion takeover bid for Ashland Oil in March 1986, which ended in their selling their Ashland stake to the company at a profit of about $15 million. Earlier this year, First City Financial, which the family controls, agreed to pay $400,000 to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it acquired Ashland stock without filing pre-merger notifications with the government, as required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law.    In ordering disgorgement of trading profit and also granting the SEC's request for a permanent injunction prohibiting First City and Mr. Belzberg from committing future 13D violations, Judge Barrington Parker took note of the FTC case, stating &quot;Defendants' record isn't completely unsullied.&quot;    The 56-page opinion is shot through with skepticism about Mr. Belzberg's actions and testimony. In discussing the benefits of the injunction, Judge Parker stated, &quot;The deliberate nature of Marc Belzberg's actions support the inference that he may violate the laws in the future.&quot;    The judge called one of Mr. Belzberg's statements &quot;suspect&quot; and one of his explanations &quot;ridiculous,&quot; and concluded that his testimony was &quot;self-serving, inconsistent with later actions and didn't square with the objective evidence.&quot;    The judge also termed &quot;highly irregular&quot; the payment of a bonus of more than $100,000 to a brokerage firm through which First City bought Ashland stock before it began using Bear Stearns. In a footnote, he stated that &quot;it is difficult to escape a finding that this was an outrageous abuse in management of a public corporation and a blatant violation of fiduciary duties.&quot;    The SEC's allegations focused on March 1986 purchases by Mr. Greenberg of 890,000 shares of Ashland with a market value of about $42.7 million. The SEC contended that the purchases were made under a scheme designed to allow First City to accumulate Ashland stock and delay disclosing its stake in the company, which would have boosted the cost of its purchases.    First City denied that it had asked Mr. Greenberg to buy the stock for it and said the purchases resulted from &quot;an honest misunderstanding.&quot;    Judge Parker vigorously rejected that assertion, stating that &quot;the facts and events support a finding that Greenberg correctly understood Belzberg's instructions to purchase Ashland shares on behalf of First City.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
