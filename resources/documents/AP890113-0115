The source _ a party member informed about preparations for a keymeeting of the party Central Committee on Monday and Tuesday _characterized the decision as ``a gamble'' and ``revolutionary'' forPoland.   If it is accepted by the opposition, it will mark the end of anera of political impasse in Poland and represent an admission thatauthorities' efforts through most of the 1980s to destroy the Eastbloc's only independent union movement have failed.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was not available for commentFriday evening.   Union national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said he had not beenexpecting such a dramatic action from the Central Committee meeting,``but if it happened, it would be very good'' and could ``open theroad'' to talks between the opposition and the government.   Members of the ruling Politburo, led by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,visited factories Friday to inform party units about the plenum, thestate-run PAP news service reported.   The source, who demanded anonymity, said Solidarity could belegalized in a few months if it agrees to certain conditions, whichhe said might be expected to include a promise to obey a 1982 unionlaw that spells out arbitration procedures in collective bargainingdisputes and bans wildcat strikes.   Solidarity, banned seven years ago, has said it would acceptlegalization within the framework of that law.   Solidarity would also be expected to begin talks immediately withthe authorities, the source said. It would be asked to agree withauthorities on the form and aims of a new election law that couldresult in a ``substantial presence'' of the opposition in parliament_ but leave the party in a coalition majority with the alliedPeasant and Democratic parties, the source said.   The arrangement would mean the communists would have diminishedpower in the parliament, because they now have an absolute majorityand do not need the coalition parties to rule, the source said.   Parliamentary elections are scheduled this year and Jaruzelskihas stressed that more opposition voices should be heard inparliament. However, the party wants to allocate seats to variousconstituencies rather than have Western-style competition amongopposing parties, as the opposition prefers.   Other topics for discussion would be on the formation of a secondchamber of parliament and on a permanent Council of NationalReconciliation, a committee that would represent a broad politicalspectrum of views and seek consensus on major issues.   Compromise with the opposition is possible in part because of thechanging international situation, including the reforms beingcarried out by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the easing ofU.S.-Soviet tensions, the source said.   Authorities expect the West to support Polish reforms andencourage the opposition ``in a positive sense,'' but not to back``adventures, revolt and civil war,'' he said, arguing that onlypeaceful change, not confrontation, will bring results.   Poland also expects the decision to recognize Solidarity to leadWestern governments to look more favorably on the country's requestsfor credits in such forums as the Paris Club, the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank, the source said.   The country already has hints that Western governments will lookon the action favorably, he said.   ``We hope that this decision will facilitate financial relationswith the West and Western participation in the Polish reform,'' saidthe source.   ``We count on the opposition being loyal, so we can have thisyear a legal opposition in Poland,'' the source said.   He said the compromise as he described it was ``possible but not100 percent sure. There are people against agreement.''   There are party members who oppose the compromise, especiallywithin the official trade union movement OPZZ, but Jaruzelski andPrime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski favor the agreement and havesufficient backing to produce a declaration at the party meeting,the source said.   The source estimated that no more than one-third of CentralCommittee members will be opposed or hesitate before approving thedecision.   The source said Walesa must decide if he prefers ``legalizationand some divisions'' in his ranks ``or unity and continuation of thesituation.   ``According to our knowledge, Walesa and those around him are forthe agreement,'' he said.   Solidarity was suspended and then banned after a Dec. 13, 1981,military crackdown when authorities said the union had been takenover by radicals intent on toppling Poland's communist system.   The union had a 16-month legal existence after August 1980, andcontinued to be active after the imposition of martial law, first asan underground organization and more openly since a 1986 politicalamnesty.</TEXT></DOC>
