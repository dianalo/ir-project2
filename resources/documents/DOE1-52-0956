The method takes intoconsideration minimum air temperature and amplitude of daily variation,wind speed, relative humidity of air, duration of ambient temperaturebelow freezing point, and other factors. Quantitative analysis of failuresin the fleet of excavators showed that 47% of breakdowns occurred inmechanical system, 28.5% in hydraulic system, 13% in electrical system,5.5% in lubrication system and 6% in pneumatic system. Draws up recommendationsfor preventive servicing to ensure failure-free operation.</TEXT></DOC>
