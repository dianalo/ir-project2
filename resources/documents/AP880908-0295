The cuts in the Network Operations Group, which runs thelong-distance network, will amount to about 8 percent of the unit's74,000 employees, spokesman Burke Stinson said.   He said the total cuts could exceed 6,000. The company will tryto achieve as many of the cuts as possible through voluntaryretirements, resignations and reassignments to other parts of thecompany, but will not rule out layoffs, Stinson said.   ``Virtually every organization in ATandamp;T has the marching ordersto reduce the number of non-sales-related jobs. This is the mostspecific and is the earliest,'' he said.   ATandamp;T's total employment has risen by about 12,000 this year toabout 315,000 after having dropped steadily since the 1984divestiture of the local operating companies. The increase hasalarmed Chairman Robert E. Allen, who announced in July the firstcompanywide hiring freeze since the Bell System breakup.   Some of the people being cut from Network Operations will beamong the 3,000 people whom ATandamp;T is reassigning from staff jobs invarious parts of the company to jobs in sales, marketing andcustomer support, Stinson said.   Network Operations does not include operators. Most of the jobsare for supervisors and managers of the long-distance network, andStinson said the computerization of the network has reduced theneed for staff.</TEXT></DOC>
