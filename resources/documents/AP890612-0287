On other markets, cotton futures continued to rebound from lastweek's losses tied to political unrest in China and petroleumfutures were down amid fears that dissension within OPEC will meanmore oil at cheaper prices.   The world's leading coffee producers and consumers extended theirmeeting in London through the weekend in an attempt to reach a newagreement to replace one that expires Oct. 1.   The major stumbling block is a request by the largest consumers _notably the United States and Europe _ to end a two-tier systemallowing exporting countries to sell the commodity to non-members ofthe International Coffeee Organization at prices below what ICOmembers pay.   ``There was pressure from the opening bell and it got stronger astime went on and it became more apparent that no agreement was inthe offing,'' said Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets,Inc. in New York.   Coffee settled 3.75 cents to 6.23 cents lower on the New YorkCoffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery inJuly at 124.84 cents.   Contracts for three of the four deferred months closed down the6-cent daily trading limit; the 6.23-cent loss was for Septembercontracts, which have no limit.   Cotton futures hit the daily limit as well, but on the upside.Cotton settled 1.90 cents to 2 cents higher, with July at 66.95cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.   ``We had some severe weather regarding the crop in the field, butthe climb was more a continuation from the support lines we put downlast week during the events in China,'' said Ed Whitten of BalfourMaclaine Corp. in New York.   Crude oil futures led the products in a downturn at the New YorkMercantile Exchange.   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesmeeting last week in Vienna agreed to raise the cartel's dailyoutput from 18.5 million barrels per day to 19.5 million, althoughmost analysts say OPEC members already were producing closer to 21million.   Kuwait's official quota before the meeting was 1.037 millionbarrels per day and was increased to 1.093 million. Analysts saidKuwait's actual production was more than 2 million.   Several of the nation's leaders were quoted Monday saying Kuwaitwill maintain that level _ a signal that OPEC will be unable torestrict production levels even to 19.5 million barrels per day forthe cartel.   ``Then, there's the question of will they be cheating more withhigher quotas, or just the same?'' said Peter Beutel of EldersFutures Inc. in New York. ``Does this mean 21 million or somethingcloser to 22 million?''   Crude oil settled 42 cents to 63 cents lower, with July at $19.26a barrel; heating oil was 1.58 cents to 1.79 cents lower, with Julyat 45.45 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1.85 cents to 2cents lower, with July at 61.73 cents a gallon.   Grain futures prices were mostly higher, but corn and soybeansmixed to mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.   Weather, the dominant feature in the market, was behind bothtrends.   Heavy rain in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Midwest delayedharvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support pricesthroughout the day.   But the same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of theupper Midwest and nourished the still-developing crops in Iowa,Illinois and Indiana.   On the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher, withthe contract for delivery in July at $3.88\ a bushel; corn was 2\cents lower to 4 cents higher, with July at $2.49{ a bushel; oatswere 3{ cents to 4{ cents lower, with July at $1.58 cents a bushel;and soybeans were 8{ cents to 11} cents lower, with July at $6.94 abushel.   Gold and silver both climbed at the Comex after a steep drop lastFriday. Gold settled $3.80 to $4.50 higher, with June at $361.90 atroy ounce; silver was 3.1 cents to 4 cents higher, with June at520.2 cents a troy ounce.   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago MercantileExchange.   Live cattle were unchanged to .80 cent higher, with June at 70.22cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .73 cent higher, withAugust at 80.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .30 centhigher, with June at 48.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellieswere unchanged to 1.65 cents higher, with July at 33.60 cents apound.</TEXT></DOC>
