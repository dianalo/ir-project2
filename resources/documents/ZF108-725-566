That took 20 years !andP;  &quot;DEC is one of the fewcompanies that understands the use of knowledge.andP;  They are in the midst ofthe revolution.andP;  Using knowledge takes a lot of money!&quot;andM;&quot;Lisp is dead! Or, at least dying.andP;  Lisp will be replaced by C language.&quot;andM;&quot;The Holy Grail is the intelligent organization.andP;  AI can make that possible.andO;We have to harness the power of AI!&quot;andM;(Mr.andP;  Fox is a good, effective speaker.)andM;* Howard Shrob, Symbolics (the session chairman)andM;&quot;The practice of the 1980s was to use the technology of the 1970s to solvethe problems of the 1990s  - while forgetting the lessons of the 1960s.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Shrob reviewed the short history of AI.andP;  He claims the early days of AItaught lessons that have been forgotten for some years but are now beingresurrected.andP;  Investigation of new problem solving techniques has come backinto vogue.andP;  Of course,  you have to know what the problem is before you cansolve it.&quot;andM;All problems fall into a small number of categories &quot;about 100.&quot;andP;  You have toknow which category applies before you know if you have the correctapplication to solve it.&quot;andM;&quot;The only technology [to use] today is Lisp!&quot; (He said emphatically whileturning to give Mr. Fox an old-fashioned dirty look.) That was hisintroduction to a description of his company's product: &quot;A superstructure ofLisp called 'Joshua.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
