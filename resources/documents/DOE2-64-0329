In the Pembina oilfield, the availability of abundantdrill core from the Cardium Formation has allowed investigation of &quot;muddy&quot;strata which would not be as well preserved in outcrop. The lithofaciesand associated ichnogenera identified in this study are useful in environmentalinterpretation and may help in the application of sequence stratigraphyto the Cardium Formation. The Cardium is late Turonian in age, and wasdeposited in the epeiric seaway which extended across North America atthat time. Within the formation, coarsening- and thickening-upward sequencesof mudstone and snadstone are unconformably overlain by conglomerateand mudstone. Ichnofossils are found in abundance in all cores examined.The relationships of these ichnofossils, to each other and to the lithofaciesof the Cardium, provide evidence for an interpretation of storm-dominateddeposition in a proximal offshore setting. Relative sea-level variationsare documented in the multiple coarsening-upward sediment packages andby an unconformity surface found at the base of the conglomerate. Theunconformity surface at the base of the conglomerate may represent asequence boundary and may be indicative of a maximum lowstand of sealevel. The base of the conglomerate also contains a sparsely developedyet highly specialized suite of ichnofossils which was emplaced whenerosion had exhumed a previously buried substrate. Recognition of thisfirmground ichnofossil suite may prove useful for other investigationsin sequence stratigraphy. 63 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
