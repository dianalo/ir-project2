State-run Radio Rangoon said troops shot to death six people.That brought to about 430 the official death toll since hard-lineGen. Saw Maung staged a coup Sept. 18. Diplomats say the death tollis much higher.   In some of the first displays of defiance since the coup, about10 students stood atop a parked truck and delivered speeches.Witnesses said about five students attempted to stage a similar actof defiance nearby.   But in stark contrast to earlier mass demonstrations that led toviolence with heavily armed troops, both speakers and listenersfled the scene quickly as security men arrived.   Radio Rangoon said five people were killed while trying topilfer two government warehouses. It said a gambler was shot assecurity personnel dispersed a group of gamblers in central Rangoon.   Soldiers using loudspeakers asked the capital's residents tosurrender all illegal weapons and looted material and urged parentsto ``prevent children from going astray for fear of arrest.''   The plea was aimed at stopping an exodus of young people towardthe Thai-Burmese border, where students are linking up withminority rebels who are also fighting the central government.   Some of those fleeing to the border said they saw troops line upanti-government protesters and shoot them, but military authoritiessaid they had no intention of arresting students.   Students were at the forefront of massive demonstrations thatfailed to topple 26 years of authoritarian rule instituted by NeWin.   Ne Win resigned in July and was replaced by Sein Lwin, ahard-line military man. He too resigned after massiveanti-government protests and was replaced by Maung Maung, acivilian who was ousted by Saw Maung.   Over a public address system, soldiers told residents to turn inall weapons previously announced as illegal. These include firearmsas well as crude homemade weapons like slingshots that fire dartsknown as ``jinglees.'' The soldiers promised that no action wouldbe taken against those who surrendered material looted fromgovernment warehouses.   Shoppers were seen in downtown Rangoon in fairly large numbers,although the capital's busy and colorful street life has sharplydiminished due to a shortage of money, lack of fuel for vehiclesand a ban on the once ubiquitous street vendors.   The government ordered all civil servants and workers in Burma'sstate-run factories to return to their jobs Monday or facedismissal. Most government employees have been on strike since Aug.8.</TEXT></DOC>
