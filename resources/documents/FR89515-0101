The renewed Facility OperatingLicense No. R-108 authorizes an increased power not in excess of 300 kilowatts(thermal) and will expire twenty years from its date of issuance.The amended license complies with the standards and requirements of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act andthe Commission's regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I. Those findings are setforth in the license amendment. Opportunity for hearing was afforded inthe notice of the proposed issuance of this renewal in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 15, 1986 at 51 FR 44956. No requestfor a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following noticeof the proposed action.Continued operation of the reactor at the increased power level will notrequire alternation of buildings or structures, will not lead to significantchanges in effluents released from the facility to the environment, willnot increase the probability or consequences of accidents, and will notinvolve any unresolved issues concerning alternative uses of availableresources. Based on the foregoing and on the Environmental Assessment,the Commission concludes that renewal of the license will not result inany significant environmental impacts.The Commission has prepared a Safety Evaluation Report (NUREG-1312) forthe renewal of Facility Operating License No. R-108 and has, based on thatreport, concluded that the facility can continue to be operated by thelicensee without endangering the health and safety of the public.The Commission also prepared an Environmental Assessment which was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 1, 1989 (54 FR 18614) for the renewalof Facility Operating License No. R-108 and has concluded that this actionwill not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) The applicationfor amendment dated November 14, 1986, as supplemented on June 2, 1987,August 14, 1987, April 29, 1988, and January 10, 1989; (2) Amendment No.5 to Facility Operating License No. R-108; (3) the related Safety EvaluationReport (NUREG-1312) and (4) the Environmental Assessment dated April 20,1989.
