This is seen as an important symbol of the EC's drivetoward political union and toward giving the EC moreinfluence on the world stage. But as EC members now settledown to the details of its planned military dimension, thebiggest questions still have to be answered. Are the ECcountries ready to spend more money to give their ambitionscredibility? Can they decide among themselves on adecision-making system for quick and agile action during acrisis?</LP><TEXT>   The answer that began to emerge here is that aEuro-defense arrangement won't happen overnight. For the samereason that NATO itself is scaling down, ambitions for aEuropean army won't be easy to realize: It's hard to talkabout defense when there's no clear enemy. And EC membersstill can't agree among themselves about how their defensedimension would operate.   In fact, French President Francois Mitterrand, one of themost enthusiastic of the 12 leaders for organizing defenseunder the EC umbrella, said NATO will continue to be the mainforum for Europe's defense. He seemed to be acknowledgingthat, even if a political union treaty gives the EC some rolein defense, the community will still be saddled with morecumbersome institutions and decision-making structures thanthe national governments.   &quot;We're only at the starting point of a new {foreign policyand defense} strategy for Europe,&quot; Mr. Mitterrand said.&quot;We're only at the beginning.&quot;   Nevertheless, the EC and the nine-nation Western EuropeanUnion (which is the organization where EC members discussdefense issues) were key players at the NATO conference, andit is clear that the European voice will be a stronger one infuture developments. The 16 NATO leaders agreed that givingEurope a greater share of the responsibility for decisionsand actions in military matters was &quot;essential&quot; tomaintaining the alliance, which has protected the West forover 40 years.   NATO also agreed to reorganize its own defense strategy,creating a smaller and less nuclear military force. While ECmembers seemed pleased with the outcome here, theyacknowledged that their ability to act independently of NATOin a real crisis will be severely limited.   One obstacle to the EC's ambitions is British insistencethat the EC and the WEU be kept as independent organizations.While France and Germany want to streamline the EC'sdecision-making structure so the EC ministers could decideboth foreign policy and defense questions, Britain is opposedto this.   That means that whenever the 12 EC ministers meet on apolitical or foreign policy question, they will have to calla separate meeting of the nine-nation WEU. And the WEU willhave to keep NATO fully informed of all its plans. The resultis that the WEU and EC will remain almost as awkward andclumsy as they were during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, whenthe Europeans had to hold meeting after meeting before makingdecisions.   &quot;The Western European Union should be reinforced as ameans of strengthening the European pillar of the {Atlantic}Alliance and we should make sure that all allies are properlyinvolved in decisions that may involve their security,&quot;British Prime Minister John Major said. &quot;That reflects ourview that the WEU, though politically very close to the {EC}and its foreign and security policy, should remainautonomous, subordinate neither to the {EC} nor to NATO.&quot;   France, moreover, continues to assert its independentvoice. In the last minutes of the summit Mr. Mitterrandmanaged to register a strong note of dissent. When the other15 NATO members approved a text on the Soviet Union, callingon it to move quickly to adopt a market economy and pay itsdebts, Mr. Mitterrand declared that the Soviet Unionstatement had come &quot;out of the blue,&quot; and didn't take intoaccount the obvious social problems and unrest that themarket transformation would bring about. The statement waspatronizing to the Soviet Union, he said, like an admonitionfrom a group of &quot;preacher monks.&quot;   But despite this spat, most leaders here said they sawsigns that they could agree on a compromise on the EC defenseissue that would allow them to agree on a new political uniontreaty at the Maastricht summit next month. France, theypointed out, went along with most of the major decisions atthe just-ended summit. France signed the strategic document-- the first such document it has ever endorsed.   President Bush, for his part, said he could live with theEC's defense ambitions. He seemed more worried about somepoliticians in the U.S. who want to save money by pulling outof some foreign commitments.   &quot;I'd say to the isolationists in the United States . . .look at your history and don't pull back into some fortressAmerica,&quot; Mr. Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
