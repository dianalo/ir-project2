That question is especially relevant now, as airlinesstruggle to emerge from their worst year in a decade. In1990, airline stocks plummeted as the world's carriersreported losses of $5.1 billion, more than their accumulatedprofits of the previous 10 years. Industry officials,including the head of the International Air TransportAssociation, predict that final 1991 results will be evenworse.</LP><TEXT>   But the answer to Mr. Halstead's question may just be&quot;yes, now,&quot; at least for Europe's two most-visible andactively traded airline stocks: KLM Royal Dutch Airways andBritish Airways PLC.   Among European airline stocks, KLM and British Airwaysoften are considered the only game in town, as most of theothers are either tightly controlled by governments, such asAir France, or have few shares on the market. And in recentweeks, traders and analysts have been watching BritishAirways and KLM closely. The Dutch carrier has confirmed thatthe two are in talks on possible areas of cooperation.British Airways has declined to comment except to say it'sactively seeking partners.   On Friday, KLM Chairman Pieter Bouw made his first publicstatement about the cooperation talks, saying there would beno outright takeover of the Dutch carrier. Mr. Bouw said thegoal of the talks with British Airways is to strengthen theposition of KLM and the Schiphol airport in the globalaviation market. He described the talks as &quot;a fruitfulexchange&quot; and dismissed rumors that the talks could lead tothousands of dismissals.   His statement came in response to questions by a Dutchnational television reporter following a meeting that Mr.Bouw and other KLM officials held with members of the Dutchcabinet, including Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. The Dutchgovernment owns 38.2% of KLM, and the meeting was arranged sothat Mr. Bouw could keep Mr. Lubbers informed of the talkswith British Airways.   But KLM officials declined to disclose what was saidduring the meeting, and continue to decline to comment on thenature of the talks with British Airways.   Few analysts believe the two airlines are talking about atakeover, although many increasingly believe the discussionscenter on a merger that would give the much larger BritishAirways a larger share in a joint holding company.   Both stocks fell on the news. In trading on London's stockexchange, British Airways stock sank to 205.50 pence ($3.63)from 211 the previous day. In Amsterdam Stock Exchangetrading Friday, KLM's shares closed at 37.80 guilders($20.77), down from 38.30 guilders Thursday.   Brokers and analysts believe the stocks could be goodbuys, depending on whether the investor believes in miracles.The first miracle would be if negotiators for two of Europe'slargest, most efficient and market-oriented carrierssuccessfully can put together a merger. The second would beif that merger receives all the necessary government andintergovernmental approvals. Unions, too, would have toagree.   The two airlines have produced surprises -- if not quitemiracles -- before. Both reported better-than-expectedearnings for the second quarter ended Sept. 30.   KLM's profit rose to 192.5 million guilders ($105.8million), or 3.60 guilders a share, from 42.7 millionguilders, or 1.50 guilders a share, a year earlier. The gainwas attributed to cost-cutting and restructuring moves.   British Airways reported a 7.3% rise in pretax profit forthe period, to #176 million ($311.3 million) from #164million, and a 5% increase in its interim dividend, to 2.94pence a share.   British Airways and KLM &quot;have surprised the whole of thestock market by their ability to control costs,&quot; says MarkMcVicar of County NatWest Wood MacKenzie. The question forinvestors, however, is whether the carriers can surpriseeveryone by cooperating.   Adds Mr. Halstead: &quot;If this deal comes through, the netbenefits to both of them could be enormous on a long-termbasis.&quot;   ---   World Market Activity                                                                                                          Tokyo stocks declined Friday. London and Frankfurt sharesalso fell.   In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei index dropped 93.07 pointsto 22687.35, on the heels of a 192.86-point slide Thursday.   The downward spiral continued Monday as the Nikkei indexplunged 518.72 points, a 2.3% drop, to close the morningsession at 22168.63.   Friday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 250million shares, up from 226.8 million shares Thursday. Losersoutnumbered gainers, 618 to 285. The Tokyo Stock Price Index,or Topix, of firstsection issues eased 2.88 points to1731.30, after dropping 16.39 points Thursday.   The Nikkei gave up its morning advance to arbitrageselling in the afternoon, falling as low as 22538.33 from theintraday high of 22965.07. But the index managed to bounce upbefore the close, helped by buying on dips and a recovery inblue-chip electrical issues.   Shares linked to AIDS and biotechnology research, whichhave recently been in favor, fell sharply on profit-taking.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex shed 8.4 points to 2420.2, after losing 18.9 pointsThursday. The narrower FT 30-share index dropped 16.3 pointsto 1840.1, following a decline of 11.5 points Thursday.Volume was 517 million shares, compared with 556.3 millionThursday.   Share prices finished above the day's worst levels in asession dominated by technical trading. Shares were pressuredby a day-earlier sell program that sent the closely watched100-share barometer hurtling towards the 2400 mark before asmall rebound late in the day.   Investors also kept to the sidelines ahead of news thisweek from the U.S. that is expected to pour cold water on anyhope that the U.S. economy is coming out of recession.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share index ended at 1566.57,down 21.59 points, or 1.4%, after rising 2 points Thursday.   Share prices retreated broadly Friday, mostly because ofworries over the possibility of a coup attempt in the SovietUnion. There was also profit-taking on gains big investorshave accumulated since the beginning of this year.   Lower stock prices in London and Tokyo undermined Germanshares. Wall Street was closed Thursday for the ThanksgivingDay holiday, also discouraging buyers from entering themarket before the start of U.S. business Friday.
