They were Andrew Marshall, who judges the world militarybalance for the Pentagon, Henry Rowen of Stanford, CharlesWolf of Rand, and Vladimir Treml of Duke. Not one was fromthe CIA, and only Mr. Treml was a Soviet scholar. Who was theman who instigated their far-seeing, icon-busting study?</LP><TEXT>   Robert Gates.   Yes, the same Robert Gates who is President Bush's nomineeas CIA director and is described by his enemies as apoliticizing, brook-no-dissent enforcer for Bill Casey.   &quot;I think he's getting a bum rap,&quot; says Mr. Wolf, who is soesteemed as a political economist he's routinely consulted byPentagon bigshots. &quot;The notion that Bob Gates quelled dissentisn't fair. He's the main reason I got into this issue. Thecharge he gave us was to look at all the evidence and see ifthe CIA was far off in its view of the Soviet economy andmilitary spending.&quot;   &quot;Far off&quot; is putting it kindly. The Rowen-Wolf studyremains classified, but spook-watchers know it's the onlyU.S. study that correctly assessed Soviet economic collapseand its consequences for the Soviet military and empire.   Meanwhile, our salaried spooks were asleep at theirstereotypewriters. Even after Mr. Wolf and friends showedotherwise, CIA Sovietologists clung to their belief that theSoviet economy was &quot;muddling through&quot; at more than half thesize of our own. Defense spending was said to be only 15% ofGNP.   The Rowen-Wolf team figured the Soviet economy was lessthan one-third the size of ours, with defense spending at 25%or more of GNP, suggesting that something had to give. TheRowen-Wolf findings have since been acknowledged by Russians,not to mention by events. Comparing the Rowen-Wolf figureswith the CIA's in the Oval Office in 1986, the Gipperquipped, &quot;Yours look right to me.&quot;   Yet, in a supreme irony, Robert Gates is now the man inthe dock for having failed to predict the demise of theSoviet Union. Even more perversely, he's accused by CIAanalysts from the very same school of Sovietapology thatmisunderstood the nature of the Soviet crisis. Mr. Gates'stravail proves that in Washington it's dangerous to be wrong,but it's usually fatal to be right.   Why does this revisionism sell? In part because ofpolitics. Democratic Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and BillBradley, who are smart enough to understand the real CIAfailure, want to discredit U.S. defense spending during the1980s. They also want to show that their party's post-Vietnamdovishness wasn't wrong after all. If they can show Mr. Gatesdidn't foresee the Soviet collapse, they think they candiscredit the hard-line Reagan policies he supported.   This is also ironic, because the Rowen-Wolf team wasactually the hard-line team; they figured U.S. pressure wouldmake a struggling empire collapse even sooner. Last week atWashington's Carnegie Endowment, Vladimir Lukin, a BorisYeltsin foreign-policy adviser, said that such policies asthe Reagan Doctrine and SDI &quot;accelerated our economicconvulsions by perhaps five years.&quot; Maybe the Senate shouldinvite Russians to defend Mr. Gates.   The other force at work is what one source calls &quot;therevenge of the nerds,&quot; or the CIA bureaucracy. Mr. Gates waspart of a Reagan vanguard that wanted to make intelligencebetter serve U.S. foreign policy. &quot;I was hired to changethings,&quot; he told the Senate yesterday.   Yet over the years a hidebound bureaucracy at the CIAbegan to think of itself as the repository of truth; theywere &quot;objective,&quot; while elected policy-makers were&quot;political.&quot; In the real world, of course, it's absurd tothink that career analysts don't also have their own&quot;political&quot; views.   This mindset is drummed into analysts the minute they setfoot in Langley, though. In an eye-popping outline for oneinstructor's CIA orientation course (provided by aninformant), there are said to be two different &quot;schools&quot; of&quot;intelligence and policy-making.&quot;   The outline describes one as the &quot;traditional&quot; CIA school,which is said to wear &quot;white hats.&quot; The other school,described as &quot;modernist,&quot; is said to wear &quot;black hats.&quot; Andthe greenhorn CIA analysts are told that the &quot;Godfather&quot; ofthe black hats is none other than &quot;Bob Gates.&quot;   According to the outline, the white hats think soundpolicy &quot;starts with realities,&quot; while the black hats favor&quot;political considerations.&quot; The whites stress &quot;foreignconstraints,&quot; while the Gatesian black-hatters look to &quot;U.S.opportunities.&quot; The white hat school &quot;prevails amongacademics&quot; and &quot;congressional Democrats,&quot; while the blackhats include &quot;Casey and the 1981 CIA transition team.&quot;   Even if this is exaggerated by the instructor to make apoint, it suggests how badly the CIA bureaucracy needs to beshaken up, especially after the Cold War. Mr. Gates's criticsdon't want him confirmed because they know that as a &quot;blackhat&quot; he's exactly the man to do the shaking. Sen. Moynihanhas proposed that the CIA be abolished and transferred to theState Department. If Bob Gates isn't confirmed, Mr. Bushshould take him up on the offer.</TEXT></DOC>
