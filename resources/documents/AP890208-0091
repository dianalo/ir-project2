Andres Rodriguez hasmoved to bolster his new government by replacing about 50 militaryofficers, including commanders of the three army corps, with peopleof his own choice.   Rodriguez deposed President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in a bloodycoup Friday and was sworn in as president. He then dissolvedCongress and called national elections May 1.   Stroessner, who had ruled the country 34 years, has been exiledto Brazil, and his name is being expunged from many civic monuments.He said Tuesday he would spend the rest of his life in Brazil.   Leaders of four opposition parties say they need more time toorganize for the elections, but government leaders rejected suchappeals.   ``The national constitution sets the time allowed'' to choose apermanent successor to Stroessner, Foreign Minister Luis MariaArgana said. ``And we already have given the maximum allowed.''   Critics disagreed.   The government ``always cites the constitution when it isconvenient for them,'' said Euclides Acevedo, president of theleft-leaning Revolutionary Febrerista Party.   The opposition parties, three of which werblication.The weekly, which criticized and ridiculed the Stroessner regime,was closed by the government in August 1987.
