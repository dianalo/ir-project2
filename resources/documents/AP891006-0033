The United States will try to negotiate rules for reputableinternational testing at the coming round of global trade talks inGeneva, Mrs. Hills said during a preview this week of a plannedjourney to South Korea and Japan.   ``We simply must rely upon scientific data and medical data tosupport the allegations that a product is harmful, and if it is notharmful there ought to be no barrier whatsoever,'' she told thegathering of mostly Asian reporters.   ``If we don't get discipline in this area, I think this will bethe trade controversy of the '90s. It will be very unpleasantbecause it will be based upon misinformation, it will fan publicpassion and it will be enormously unfair.''   The United States, the world's major exporter of agriculturalproducts, is particularly sensitive to the market impact ofunverified claims about food contamination.   Mrs. Hills, who leaves Saturday for Seoul, said she expected theSouth Korean government ``to prevent vandalism ... andmisinformation'' she says has been used there against U.S. products.   She said continuing boycotts of U.S. grapefruit and otherproducts in South Korea were ``outrageous,'' saying they weretriggered by rumors about the use of harmful chemicals such as alar.   The alar report was ``pure myth and fiction ... in our view ameans of preventing the sale of grapefruit in Korea,'' Mrs. Hillssaid.   She said it was on the same level as a tactic of putting snakesin a theater to prevent distribution of U.S. films in Korea lastyear.   Her reference to beef recalled last year's trade conflict overWestern Europe's ban on U.S. meat produced using a growth hormonefavored by American livestock producers. The U.S. governmentsharply disputed European claims that the hormone left a harmfulresidue and for a time ordered retaliatory tariffs against Europeanproducts.   The dispute ended after U.S. packing houses recaptured marketsby exporting meat from animals not treated with the hormone.</TEXT></DOC>
