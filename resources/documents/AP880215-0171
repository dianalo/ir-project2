HEATH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Opposition leaders on Mondaychallenged the lopsided vote totals that gave Gen. AlfredoStroessner his eighth straight term as president.   The ruling Colorado Party's final, unofficial tally releasedMonday showed that Stroessner won 88.6 percent of the vote.   The party's count also showed a 7.4 percent absentee rate, butopposition leaders contended that up to 40 percent of the 1,446,665eligible voters boycotted Sunday's balloting.   Opposition leaders had urged voters to abstain and accused theruling party of stuffing ballot boxes, not providing oppositionballots, failing to guarantee voting secrecy and allowingineligible voters to cast ballots.   The 75-year-old Stroessner, the longest-serving head of state inthe Western Hemisphere, has led Paraguay since a 1954 military coup.   The Colorado Party also won two-thirds of the 72 house seats and36 senate seats. The remaining one-third will be splitproportionally between two participating opposition parties.   The Radical Liberal Party received 96,231 votes, or about 7.2percent, the ruling party said. The Liberal Party got 42,056, or3.1 percent.   The party tally listed 8,838 spoiled votes and 5,627 blankballots and said 107,220 people did not vote. Voting is obligatoryfor all citizens between 18 and 60 years old.   Miguel Abdon Saguir, a vice president of the unrecognizedAuthentic Radical Liberal Party, charged that ``voting booths werelacking in the majority of voting places and the vote was publicand not secret, polling officials handed out sealed envelopes withthe official candidate list already inside and opposition partieshad few or no observed overseers at the polls.''   Luis Andrada Nogues, secretary-general of the ChristianDemocrats, also an unrecognized party, told the Roman Catholicbroadcast station Radio Caritas that the majority of polling placeslacked opposition observers and in some cases no opposition ballotswere provided.   ``As a result, this is a de facto government,'' he added.``Yesterday's elections were a joke and the Radical Liberal andLiberal parties allowed themselves to be used in a farce.''   Stroessner on Sunday described the unrecognized opposition as``liars.'' Justice Minister Jose Eugenio Jacquet referred to themas ``insurrectionists and subversives.''   Sabino Montanaro, interior minister and party president, saidthat the government plans to combat unemployment, eliminate slumsand shantytowns and promote domestic and foreign investment.   The Colorado Party ticket led by Stroessner garnered 1,186,693votes, or 88.6 percent of the total, the party said. In 1983,Stroessner won slightly more than 90 percent.   Spokesmen for the National Election Board, which has a majorityof Colorado Party members, said final official vote totals probablywould be available Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
