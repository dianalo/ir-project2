The {pi}-allyl complex of 3d orbital transition metal hasbeen successfully synthesized and applied to the polymerization of conjugateddiene. As to rare earth-based coordination catalyst, it has been suggestedthat polymerization can take place in a similar {pi}-allyl mechanism.But so far as is known, nothing has been reported on the rare earth {pi}-allylcomplex itself and on the experimental evidence for the mechanism. Herethey present some novel NMR results on the rare earth {pi}-butenyl system.</TEXT></DOC>
