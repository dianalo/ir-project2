From the time the two areas were reopened, vessels were limitedto one trip a quarter in each of the two areas. Vessel owners were alsorequired to provide advance notice of their intention to fish in eitherof these areas in the course of their regular notification of surf clamfishing days. Section 652.23(c) established that adjustment to harvestrestrictions in a reopened area will be made by <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.Logbook records submitted by surf clam harvesters were analyzed at theconclusion of each quarter since the reopening of the two areas. From theserecords it was determined that during the first quarter of 1989, the catchper unit of effort in the Ocean City reopened area had declined to 205.9bushels per hour. The catch per unit of effort in the general fishery forthe same time period was 199 bushels per hour and the Regional Directormade the determination to remove the effort restrictions for the OceanCity reopened area. The catch per unit of effort for the Atlantic Cityreopened area for the first quarter was at 241 bushels per hour necessitatingthe continued imposition of the effort restrictions. A letter was sentto all vessel operators eligible to fish the Mid-Atlantic surf clam fisheryinforming them of this decision.Analysis of catch records for the second quarter of 1989 indicated thatthe catch rate for the Atlantic City reopened area dropped to 201.6 bushelsper hour while the general fishery catch rate rose to 212.0 bushels perhour. Given that the catch rates are similar and the criterion for removingrestrictions is satisfied, the Regional Director has determined that effortrestrictions should be removed and the Atlantic City area should becomepart of the general fishery. The only remaining closed area is the areadesignated as Chincoteague which continues to remain closed with no fishingoperations allowed.The effort restrictions of one trip in each reopened area and the notificationrequirements imposed through the notice published on June 7, 1988 (53 FR20854) are terminated effective July 2, 1989. After that date, fishingfor surf clams in either area will only be subject to the provisions applyingto the general surf clam fishery.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR Part 652 and is takenin compliance with Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 652</ITAG>Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
