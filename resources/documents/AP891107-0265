Southland, which acquired Citgo in 1983 by issuing $254 millionin stock, sold half of the Tulsa, Okla.-based company in 1986 tothe Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela for$290 million. On Monday, it announced plans to sell the other halfto the Venezuelan company for $675 million.   Southland said terms of the agreement had not been completed andremain subject to an acceptable definitive agreement.   The sale would give the Dallas-based operator of the 7-Elevenconvenience store chain a boost as it works to continue meetinghuge debt payments resulting from the company's $4.9 billionleveraged buyout in 1987 that took the company private.   The deal also would give Venezuela a greater U.S. market sharefor its crude oil.   The transaction would make Citgo the first large U.S. oilcompany to be acquired by a member of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   OPEC members have carried out a campaign of acquiring the``downstream'' side of the oil business _ refining and distributionfacilities _ in order to guarantee access to industrialized marketsin the face of falling oil prices during the last decade.   The Citgo purchase comes on the heels of a joint venture formedlast week by Petroleos de Venezuela and Union Oil of Californiathat includes 50 percent shares of major assets such as Unocal'sChicago refinery near Lemont, Ill.   Petroleos de Venezuela also bought Jan. 1 the half-interest in aCorpus Christi refinery from Champlin Refining that it did notalready own.   Last year, Saudi Arabia paid $1.28 billion for half of TexacoInc.'s refining and marketing operations in 23 Eastern and GulfCoast states.   One of Citgo's principal assets is the nation's eighth-largestrefinery, located in Lake Charles, La., said Southland spokeswomanCecilia Stubbs Norwood. The refinery is able to efficiently convertlow-grade crude oil into high octane fuel.   Citgo, created from the refinery, marketing and transportationoperations of the old Cities Service Co., earned $165.6 million on$4.1 billion in revenues last year, a 24 percent increase in sales.In the quarter ended June 30, earnings were $39.2 million on $1.3billion in sales, compared with $33.9 million on $1.02 billion insales in the year-ago quarter.   Southland, taken private by the founding Thompson family in the1987 buyout, said in May it would seek ways to cash in on itsinterest in Citgo, and the sale price is in the range analysts hadexpected. The Venezuelan company has first rights in acquiringSouthland's stake.   Southland has some large payments coming due on its debt, with$258 million due Dec. 31 and an additional $250 million due throughnext year. Some analysts have questioned Southland's ability tomeet those payments, but the company has disputed those forecasts.   Southland said it would continue as a prime retailer of Citgoproducts.   In the quarter ended June 30, Southland lost $67.01 million.   Besides the Lake Charles refinery, Petroleos de Venezuela willacquire pipelines running from the refinery to Chicago and NewJersey, 43 oil terminals and access to 300 other terminalsscattered across the U.S.   Citgo supplies 6 percent of the U.S. aviation fuel market, 5percent of the lubricant market and 4 percent of service stationsales.   Venezuela also owns part of four refineries in West Germany, twoin Sweden, one in Belgium, and the huge Isla refinery in Curacao,capable of processing 300,000 barrels a day.   Venezuela in 1988 processed about 945,000 barrels a day ofrefined oil inside Venezuela, and 630,000 barrels in its overseasrefining operations, placing it among OPEC leaders in refined oilproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
