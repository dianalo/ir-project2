Bangladesh, adhering to a U.N.-ordered ban on trade with Iraq aspunishment for its invasion of Kuwait, has barred Iraqi agents fromits tea auctions.   Sri Lanka, which wants to continue selling tea to its biggestcustomer, says Iraq made only minimal purchases at Monday's teaauction and none at all on Tuesday.   Tea, sipped sweet and dark from small glasses, is the mostpopular drink in Iraq.   Bangladesh barred Iraq from participating in Tuesday's teaauction at the port city of Chittagong, a Tea Board official saidtoday, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Iraq is Bangladesh's fourth-largest tea customer and normallybuys about 10,000 tons of the country's crop each year.   In Sri Lanka, which welcomes Baghdad's tea trade, Iraq purchasedonly 100 tons at Monday's auction _ one-fifth its usual level _ andmade no bids on Tuesday, Tea Board Chairman Sepala Illangakoonsaid. This prompted fears the Iraqi market may be drying up.   Iraq, said to be feeling the effects of the international tradeembargo, purchased 30,000 tons of Sri Lankan tea last year.   Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are among Iraq's biggest tea suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
