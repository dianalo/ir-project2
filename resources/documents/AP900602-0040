City council members on Friday formally adopted the nameChemnitz, as the city was known before the former Communistgovernment changed it in 1953 to honor the founder of modernsocialism.   However, the council decided that the city of 309,000 will beknown by both names for a one-year transitional period.   In an April referendum, more than 76 percent of the people votingsaid they wanted the city's old name back.   Chemnitz is about 75 miles south of Berlin.</TEXT></DOC>
