ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   The nation's largest general retailers report that their salesimproved in June following dismal performances in April and May,but industry analysts say consumers still are spending cautiouslyas they have all year.   ``It's a reprieve,'' Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., said Thursday after reviewing the Junenumbers. ``It does not say the consumer is going on a wild spendingspree.''   ``It's not a great environment, but things are better than theywere,'' said Linda Kristiansen, an analyst with the investment firmDean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Industry-wide, sales were up between 3.5 percent and 4 percentlast month and have risen about 2.5 percent so far this year, Ms.Kristiansen said.   In reaching those estimates, she considered what retailers callsame-store sales, those from stores open at least a year. Analystsbelieve same-store sales give a more accurate picture of aretailer's performance than totals that include figures from newstores.   Analysts said the belated arrival of hot weather lured consumersinto stores to buy summer clothing and seasonal items such asgarden equipment and outdoor barbecues.   Walter Loeb, who tracks retailers for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., saidsales were aided by the markdowns retailers continued to take toclear their inventories. Analysts were watching closely for anyeffect on sales from the Midwestern drought. Monroe H. Greenstein,an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said sales volume wasunaffected last month, but could be in July.   Retailers generally have been disappointed by 1988 sales, whichhave not kept pace with inflation. Consumer prices rose at anannual rate of 4.4 percent through May, according to LaborDepartment figures.   Stores have been slumping for more than a year because ofeconomic uncertainty and disappointment with current fashions.Sales worsened in April and May, with cold and wet weather blamedfor the deterioration.   Edelman said the sales pickup so far was principallyweather-related.   Morgan Stanley's Loeb was more optimistic. Although sales wereup only moderately last month, ``it certainly points to a betterfall season,'' he said.   Storeowners and investors watch sales figures for an indicationof retailers' earnings, while economists monitor the results as abarometer of economic health. Consumer spending accounts fortwo-thirds of the gross national product.   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said itsoverall sales were up 9.8 percent in June from year-earlier levels,and rose 5 percent for the first 22 weeks of the fiscal year.Sears' same-store sales were up 5.1 percent last month and 2percent for the year so far.   K mart Corp. said its overall June sales rose 7 percent, whileyear-to-date sales were up 5.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.9percent last month and 2 percent so far this year.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 32 percent inboth June and the year to date. Same-store sales were up 13 percentin June and 12 percent for the five months.   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported its overall sales rose 3.4 percentlast month and 2.6 percent for the 22 weeks. Same-store sales rose3 percent in June and 1.6 percent for the year so far.   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall June sales rose 19.6percent and its year-to-date sales were up 18.4 percent. Same-storesales increased 3.3 percent in June and 1.9 percent for the year todate.   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 22.3percent last month and 10.1 percent for the year so far. Itssame-store sales were up 4.8 percent for June and 0.8 percent forthe 22-week period.   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported sales increases of 11.7 in June and12.1 percent for the year to date.
