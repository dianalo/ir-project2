The comparison of the data obtained with the known datashows that the transition from yttrium ferrogarnets to lutecium ferrogarnetsis accompanied by the narrowing of such regions, decrease in garnet structurestability which agrees with the data on Y/sup 3+/ and Lu/sup 3+/ componentdistribution between liquid and solid phase.</TEXT></DOC>
