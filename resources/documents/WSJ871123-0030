Lawmakers from both the political left and right are unhappy with the package's mix of tax increases and spending cuts -- arguing, respectively, that the agreement is too tepid about taxes or spending. And even the congressional negotiators who shaped it concede that the agreement isn't as bold as they had hoped.    Further, enactment of the accord's $9 billion in higher taxes will be made more difficult by the negotiators' decision effectively to drop from pending tax-increase legislation provisions that would cost the government revenue. The Reagan administration had opposed moves to raise other taxes to pay for these provisions. Typically, such revenue-losing provisions are used as sweeteners to attract votes for tax bills.    Despite the complaints, some lawmakers said they are likely to swallow hard and enact the agreement into law. &quot;It has a tough road ahead, but . . . it's going to pass,&quot; said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas). &quot;The alternative would mean a fallout in the financial markets that would be quite severe.&quot;    Still, House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said that selling the package to GOP House members would be &quot;a more difficult chore&quot; than reaching the accord itself.    President Reagan embraced the agreement, saying it &quot;sends a strong signal both at home and abroad that together we can and will get our deficit under control -- and keep it that way.&quot; But Rep. Steve Bartlett (R., Texas) said the accord &quot;is going to have serious problems&quot; in Congress. &quot;It's got too much taxes and too little spending cuts,&quot; he said.    The proposed package contains savings that negotiators claim total $30.2 billion for this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and $45.8 billion in the next fiscal year. In fact, excluding one-time savings such as income from the sale of federal assets, the package this year would narrow the deficit just enough to substitute for the $23 billion in automatic spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law, which went into effect Friday.    Republican Rep. John Duncan of Tennessee predicted that opposition to the plan may evaporate once legislators recognize that failing to enact it would leave the Gramm-Rudman cuts in effect. The new plan, he says, &quot;isn't something we can go and brag about, but it's the very best we could do under the circumstances.&quot;    Already this weekend, Caspar Weinberger and Frank Carlucci -- the former and new Defense secretaries -- began lobbying GOP lawmakers to support the accord, which would cut military spending by only $5 billion this fiscal year, compared with the $11.5 billion reduction required under the Gramm-Rudman law.    In addition to the goal of increasing taxes $9 billion this year, the bipartisan agreement calls for $14 billion in new revenues next fiscal year. Both Sen. Bentsen and House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said they hoped a tax-boost package can be developed using provisions of pending tax legislation, which would hit corporations and wealthy individuals hardest.    While the accord itself doesn't limit the type of tax increases that can be considered to meet the accord's revenue target, Rep. Rostenkowski and President Reagan agreed in a phone call Friday that the Illinois Democrat wouldn't tamper with tax indexing or look to income tax rates, value-added taxes, or sales taxes in crafting the tax-increase package.    Under the accord, military spending is to be cut by $8.2 billion in fiscal year 1989, which begins next Oct. 1. Nonmilitary programs subject to annual appropriations would be reduced by $2.6 billion this fiscal year, with $600 million of that from foreign aid, and by $3.4 billion next fiscal year.    Entitlement programs, for which spending is dictated by permanent law rather than annual appropriations bills, are to be reduced by $4 billion this fiscal year and by $5.9 billion next fiscal year. The bulk of those savings are to come in Medicare and farm price support programs.    About $8.4 billion in savings in each of the two years are to come from fees charged to users of certain federal programs, increased enforcement of existing tax laws and sales of federal assets. All those claimed savings are heavily criticized by Republicans as either illusory or short-lived.    While approving changes in various categories of spending, the negotiators didn't specify exactly which programs would be cut or which taxes would be increased. They did, however, exempt some spending programs, such as Social Security, from cuts. Some lawmakers had proposed limiting cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other pension programs.    Lawmakers will begin the task of translating the accord's broad outlines for spending cuts and tax increases into law next week, when they return from their Thanksgiving vacation. They hope to complete their work by Dec. 16, when the current, short-term catchall spending bill runs out, and a full-year appropriation is needed.    By then, they intend to pass a package of legislation, in one or two bills, that includes a tax-increase measure, changes in entitlements, and an appropriations bill.    Some lawmakers had proposed increasing taxes more than $9 billion in order to produce enough revenue to pay for a few popular revenue-losing proposals and still come out with a $9 billion net gain. Since negotiators agreed that this year's tax increase could total just $9 billion, congressional tax-writers almost surely will have to drop these provisions.    That will be a blow to some 20 million mutual-fund holders and multinational corporations with large research expenditures, both of which previously had persuaded lawmakers to include provisions in pending tax bills to reduce their tax burden. It also means trouble for a provision approved by the Senate Finance Committee to repeal the windfall profits tax on oil.    Sen. Bentsen said he wasn't giving up on the windfall profits or the research provision, which would allow corporations to allocate their research and development credits to increase their foreign tax credits. &quot;One way or another, I'm going to get them,&quot; he said, adding that they could be placed in separate bills or in the pending trade legislation. </TEXT></DOC>
