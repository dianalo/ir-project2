ButAssistant U.S. Attorney Mary Pougiales, in court papers, likened Medjuck'sproposal to &quot;preferential treatment for wealthy, high-level narcoticstraffickers that occurs in Mexico and Colombia.&quot;;   Douglas Schwartz, a lawyerfor Medjuck, said he was not surprised by the rejection.;   Lynch is &quot;a greatjudge&quot; but &quot;doesn't know Michael Medjuck like (co-counsel) John Markham and Iknow Michael Medjuck,&quot; Schwartz said. &quot;I know he's not a danger to thecommunity. I know he's not going to flee. He just wants to stay and prove hisinnocence.&quot;;   Schwartz said he would recommend against an appeal. Medjuck isscheduled to go to trial in March.;   Medjuck, 41, from Vancouver, B.C., wasone of seven people charged last September with conspiring to smuggle 70 tonsof hashish into the United States and conspiring to distribute 2.4 tons ofhashish. He faces 20 years to life in prison if convicted.;   Medjuck is beingheld without bail in the Oakland city jail with seven other inmates. Hecomplained that the conditions were hampering his preparation of a defense.;  His lawyers proposed renting a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Fox Plaza andposting off-duty police officers as armed guards around the clock. Medjuck wasto wear a transmitting device on his leg and see only his lawyers, theirinvestigators and his guards.;   The proposed supervisors were a former chiefdeputy U.S. marshal; Harold Lipset, a prominent private investigator, andformer FBI agent Charles Bates, who headed the San Francisco FBI office duringthe Hearst case.;   Bates said he was putting his reputation on the line forthe proposal. &quot;I know flight risks and I know dangerous persons. MichaelMedjuck is neither,&quot; he said.;   &quot;There's only one way out, and that's if he'sgot wings or a bungee cord,&quot; said Lipset.;   But prosecutors said the proposalcould pose risks to other tenants, was nowhere near as secure as a jail, andwas unfair to Medjuck's fellow defendants, who remain in federal custody.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  463  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 28, 199100333176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
