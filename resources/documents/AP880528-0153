A Syrian command source said the soldiers would remain outsidethe Hay Madi district. But the move into south Beirut's slumsappeared to increase pressure on the Syrians to seek the release ofnine Americans and nine other foreign hostages held by pro-Iraniangroups believed linked to Hezbollah.   In Damascus, Syria's information minister said despite the troopmovement, ``there is no timetable for the release of the hostages.''   ``We are still in the first step which is stopping thefighting,'' Mohammed Salman told reporters. ``We hope that throughdialogue and political action and cooperation with friends we canobtain the release of the hostages.''   A Lebanese security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the Syrian deployment around Hay Madi was meant to ``tightenthe grip on Hezbollah'' because ``the kidnappers will not be ableto move the hostages from one place to another.''   The Syrians, who moved in Friday under an agreement that haltedthe fighting between Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal militia,were accompanied by 200 Lebanese police. The 1,500 soldiersdeployed Saturday raised the total number in the 16-square-milemaze of streets and alleys to 2,600.   There were no reports of violence. The fighting between therival Shiite militias broke out May 6 and left at least 300 peopledead and 1,000 wounded.   The Syrian infantrymen, armed with automatic weapons androcket-propelled grenade launchers, moved in after Hezbollah andAmal agreed to stop shooting. Hezbollah won control of 90 percentof the slums in the fighting.   Salman said Syrian troops were to withdraw ``within a few days''and leave security in the hands of Lebanese police.   But the information minister also said Syrian troops will remainstationed at eight points on the perimeter of the area and be onconstant alert to move in ``when security demands or when requestedby the Lebanese security forces.''   The Syrians made no attempt to deploy in the Hay Madi district.A source at the Syrian command, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Hezbollah's barracks and its environs were ``not included inthe deployment plan.''   However, they moved into surrounding districts and set upcheckpoints into the area.   Most of the foreign hostages in Beirut are believed to be heldin the Hezbollah barracks. The hostage held longest is TerryAnderson, Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   The Syrians have said they want to help gain the hostages'release. In Bahrain, Vernon Walters, Washington's U.N. ambassador,said Saturday during a Middle East tour: ``The Syrians have assuredme they will do everything they can to help and preserve the lifeand health of the hostages.''   Women waved white scarves and threw roses and rice at the Syriansoldiers in a traditional welcome gesture as they marched into theembattled region.   Civilians who had fled the fighting started returning to theSyrian-policed districts Saturday.   ``My life's earnings have gone,'' said Azzam Sadeq as heinspected his fire-gutted third-floor apartment in Shiyah.   ``I don't have furniture any more. My daughters' books andclothes were also burned. We don't have enough money to repair thedamage and buy new furniture and clothes,'' he said with tears inhis eyes.   In Bir el-Abed, a Hezbollah stronghold, Syrian troops took uppositions along the main street. But they did not enter the narrowalleys and stayed away from the district's mosque, one ofHezbollah's main bases.   Unarmed Hezbollah members watched the Syrians deploy.   Under the deployment plan, both factions must keep armed forcesinside the Green Line sector that lies on the slums' eastern edge.   The Hay Madi district is considered part of the civil war GreenLine that divides Moslem west Beirut from the Christian east, saidthe source at the Syrian command.   The Syrian troops were guided through the slums Saturday by afour-man committee of representatives of Hezbollah, Amal, theSyrian military and the Iranian embassy in Beirut. Abdul HadiHamadi, Hezbollah security chief and a reputed kidnap mastermind,was on the committee.   Hamadi's brothers, Mohammed Ali and Abbas, are held in WestGermany on terrorist charges.   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is accused of the 1985 hijacking of a TWAjetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americansheld hostage for 17 days.   Abbas Hamadi has been convicted of kidnapping West Germans inBeirut in January 1987 in an apparent effort to trade them for hisbrother.</TEXT></DOC>
