The decision, reached in Oxford, Miss., appeared to signala victory for American Brands Inc. The case was widelypredicted by tobacco experts to be favorable for theplaintiff. However, as of late last night, people familiarwith the trial said that Judge Eugene Bogen hadn't dismissedthe jury, indicating that the 9-3 verdict in favor of theplaintiff wasn't final.</LP><TEXT>   Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor, died of lungcancer in 1987. His family charged American Tobacco with&quot;marketing a defective and unreasonably dangerous product.&quot;   American Tobacco, a unit of American Brands, has deniedany responsibility for Mr. Horton's death, but the caseraised hopes among anti-smoking forces. Mississippi state lawis more favorable to plaintiffs than most other states. Underits so-called comparative-negligence law, the jury could haveawarded damages to the Horton family even if it had found thetobacco company bore only 1% of the responsibility for Mr.Horton's death.   &quot;What jurors are saying is that they didn't like whattobacco companies did but they don't think smokers deserve tobe paid for what they did,&quot; said Victor Schwartz, atobacco-liability expert at the firm of Crowell andamp; Moring, ofWashington, D.C. &quot;There is no psychological negative in thisfor the industry -- the only negative is when they have topay.&quot; Mr. Schwartz added that &quot;if ever the plaintiffs weregoing to win it was this one&quot; because the liberal Mississippilaw was favorable to plaintiffs.   But Edward Popper, associate professor of marketing atBryant College, Smithfield, R.I., and a plaintiff's witness,said, &quot;For the jury to have found for the plaintiff, they hadto determine the product was unreasonably unsafe and that tosome extent Mr. Horton was unaware of that.&quot;   American Brands, which has been under a gag order, said itcouldn't comment on the outcome of the case. The plaintiff'sattorneys couldn't be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
