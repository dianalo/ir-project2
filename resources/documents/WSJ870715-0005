The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 28.38 points to 2481.35, surpassing the previous high of 2463.97, set last Wednesday.    For a change, the broader market averages posted similar gains. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.05 to 310.68, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index advanced 1.49 to 174.67 -- both exceeding records set June 22. Much of the market's recent rise has been limited to blue-chip stocks and real or rumored takeover issues.    Strong foreign buying at the opening, particularly by the Japanese, helped trigger the gains, traders said. The industrial average was up nearly 10 points in the first half hour of trading.    Kenneth Ducey, senior vice president in the institutional trading department at S.G. Warburg, said, &quot;Anticipation of lower interest rates is driving the market.&quot; Rumors of a cut in the prime rate have been circulating through the financial markets.    &quot;I think the fact that the bond market started to come off its lows and the dollar continues to be stable are the main reasons the market is up,&quot; said Peter Furniss, managing director of the equity trading department at Smith Barney Harris Upham.    Bond prices yesterday recovered some of their Monday declines, and the dollar ended slightly higher.    Another factor has been second-quarter earnings reports. &quot;That's giving investors increased confidence because many are coming in higher than expected,&quot; said a New York-based trader.    In addition to the scope of yesterday's rally, traders were excited about the volume, which expanded to 185.9 million shares on the Big Board from 152.5 million Monday. Advancers led decliners, 1,011 to 562.    Technology stocks led the advance, with the notable exception of IBM, which fell 2 3/8 to 167 1/2. The company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.95 a share, compared with $2.12 a share a year earlier.    Depending on the analyst, IBM's earnings were either above or below expectations. Last week, the consensus on Wall Street was that IBM would post per-share earnings of about $1.86, but as the time came closer for IBM to report, some analysts were expecting $2, and a few were expecting even higher. The stock ran up 2 7/8 Monday on those heightened expectations.    Many traders and analysts were saying that IBM's earnings would determine the course of yesterday's trading, but that notion turned out to be a big bust. Some analysts said that while there is disappointment IBM's profit didn't come in at the high end of expectations, the figure was still higher than last week's consensus.    One technology stock with a big gain was Honeywell, which reported that second-quarter net income rose to $1.21 a share from 80 cents a year earlier. The stock rose 2 to 84 1/2.    Among other technology stocks, Motorola gained 1 5/8 to 56 1/8, Digital Equipment rose 2 1/2 to 166 1/8, NCR was up 1 5/8 to 76 3/4, Tandem Computers advanced 1 5/8 to 32 3/8, Unisys jumped 1 1/8 to 128, Data General rose 1 1/4 to 31 1/2, and Hewlett-Packard gained 7/8 to 62 3/4. Apple Computer surged 2 1/2 to 43 in heavy over-the-counter trading. The company has reported a 65% jump in profit for the latest quarter.    Auto makers also had particularly strong increases, with Ford up 3 1/4 to 106 5/8, General Motors up 2 to 85 1/4 and Chrysler up 1 3/8 to 38 1/8.    Auto analysts said there wasn't any specific news to account for the car makers' gains, but some traders said that when institutional traders are in doubt as to where to put their money, they put them in such blue-chips as auto stocks.    The three companies reported early July sales that were similar to their recent performances. Ford notched a slight gain while GM and Chrysler posted declines.    Despite the broad-based rally, some of the factors that have worried investors lately are still present. Wall Street will be closely watching the testimony of Rear Adm. John Poindexter at the Iran-Contra hearings. Investors will also look to reports scheduled today on the May merchandise trade deficit and June industrial production for clues on the strength of the economy.    However, investors mostly shrugged off yesterday's news that retail sales rose a slim 0.4% in June.    While there is a feeling on Wall Street that yesterday's move portends further gains, many professionals remain cautious.    &quot;People are still expecting a major sell-off, a correction, but people are still fearing they'll miss a run-up in prices,&quot; Mr. Ducey said. That may have been one of the reasons behind yesterday's gains, he added.    James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, predicted that in the next five or six weeks, the market will be in a correction phase and prices will head lower.    &quot;I think this will be a very erratic market, with big swings up and big swings down,&quot; Mr. Andrews said.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average set its second consecutive record, advancing 3.42 to 1043.73.    Merck, one of the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, surged 4 3/4 to 179 3/8, and some other drug company stocks also posted hefty gains. Analysts said there are expectations these companies will post strong second-quarter earnings because of foreign currency gains and revenue growth from new products. Joseph Riccardo, an analyst at Bear Stearns, predicted that Merck's board will soon approve a dividend increase and the buyback of shares.    Gillette surged 2 1/2 to 43 7/8 on speculation Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perleman may raise his unsolicited $40.50-a-share takeover proposal.    Salomon fell 1/4 to 32 1/2 and traded as low as 31 7/8. Lewis Ranieri, who led the investment banking firm to supremacy in the mortgage-backed securities market, resigned.    Semiconductor shares advanced as the industry's recovery continues. Intel sprinted ahead 2 1/4 to 49 in over-the-counter trading of more than 2.7 million shares after reporting late Monday that revenue hit a record in the second quarter. Earnings were $46.5 million compared with a year-earlier loss of $20.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
