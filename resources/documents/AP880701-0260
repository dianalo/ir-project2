A bilateral agreement to promote, though not guarantee, Japanesepublic-sector purchases of U.S. supercomputers went into effectlast August after the United States complained that the Japanesegovernment was favoring Japanese supercomputers over their Americancounterparts.   ``I think disappointed is the word'' to describe U.S. computermakers' feeling toward Japanese government procurement of Americansupercomputers, John McPhee, director of the U.S. CommerceDepartment's Office of Computers and Business Equipment, toldreporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.   Supercomputers are advanced-technology computers that performcomplex calculations at rapid speed and are used in such fields asscience, engineering and the military.   McPhee said the first three government procurements in Japansince the agreement went into effect, by the state-run Tohoku andHokkaido universities and the High Energy Physics Laboratory, wentto NEC and Hitachi, which along with Fujitsu are Japan's leadingcomputer makers.   ``It's curious to us as we look at the data to see that (U.S.firms) have 80-85 percent of the supercomputer market in the restof the world, but a relatively small share of the private sector inJapan, and until recently had no installations in the Japanesegovernment,'' McPhee said.   McPhee headed a delegation of six U.S. supercomputermanufacturers which conducted a trade seminar and exhibition inTokyo this week. The delegation consisted of Cray Research Inc.,ETA Systems Inc., Evans andamp; Sutherland Computer Corp., MyriasComputer Corp., Prime Computer Inc., and Scientific ComputerSystems Corp.   ``The solutions (to performance problems) that these firms bringto the market are an attractive package for Japanese users,''McPhee said.   The delegation came to Japan to familiarize potential Japaneseclients with their technology and to study possible joint marketingof their products with Japanese partners, said Lee Adamson, PrimeComputer's senior manager for engineering and scientific salessupport.   ``We're having tremendous interest with prospects foraccounts,'' Adamson said. ``My experience on this mission withprospects we've talked to and the excitement and interest of oursubsidiary in Japan for the mini-supercomputer market has been verygood, and we expect some major sales in the Japanese market.''</TEXT></DOC>
