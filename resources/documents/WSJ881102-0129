Before the disclosure, Rep. St Germain held a slim lead over a Republican newcomer, Ronald Machtly, who is blaming the incumbent for the thrift industry's financial troubles. Now, Rep. St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat, is being forced to explain newly released court papers showing that the House Ethics Committee for weeks has been poring over the record of a grand-jury investigation of his high living at the thrift lobby's expense.    The congressman had denied that he was under any official investigation, but the newly available documents show the ethics panel's staff secured access to usually secret grand-jury material Sept. 6 in a court proceeding that itself had been secret.    Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson released a filing by the Ethics Committee seeking access to the grand jury material. In the filing, the panel said: &quot;{The} Justice {Department} has informed the committee that, in its view, there is 'substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct by Rep. St Germain.'&quot;    The ethics panel's filing added: &quot;A referral to the committee from Justice is a highly unusual occurrence which the committee does not take lightly. The serious tone of the letter convinces the committee that it is incumbent upon it to thoroughly consider all relevant material.&quot;    The Wall Street Journal and others reported previously that the grand jury, seeking evidence of possible bribery, found that Rep. St Germain for years accepted tens of thousands of dollars of free meals, liquor and entertainment from a lobbyist for the U.S. League of Savings Associations, James O. Freeman. The Justice Department announced last May that it wouldn't seek an indictment, however. Instead, it referred the matter to the Ethics Committee.    Judge Robinson released filings involving the grand-jury investigation late Monday in response to a request from the Public Citizen Litigation Group and the Washington Post. However, the grand-jury material itself remains under court seal.    After news accounts hit Rhode Island Monday night, Rep. St Germain made rounds of Providence television stations to deny any serious wrongdoing. &quot;If it were that serious why didn't Justice do anything about it?&quot; he said to an interviewer for WJAR television. &quot;Justice looked at me with a grand jury, and I was cleared.&quot;    Rep. St Germain's re-election chances have been in some doubt, largely because of an earlier Ethics Committee inquiry that cited him in April 1987 for numerous technical violations of House rules but didn't recommend any punishment.    Earlier this year, Republican polls showed fewer than 40% of the voters in the lawmaker's district favored re-electing him, while most said they preferred a &quot;new person.&quot; He was nearly upset in a September primary by a political newcomer, Scott Wolf, who scored 45% of the vote running an underfinanced campaign. And as news of the new court documents broke, a poll for a Providence television station was putting Mr. Machtly within one percentage point of the incumbent.    Mr. St Germain was campaigning in Rhode Island yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment, a Washington spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
