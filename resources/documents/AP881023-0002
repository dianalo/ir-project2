But when it comes to doling out dollars, nobodydoes it like the Teamsters.   For every dollar the National Rifle Association spends on thisyear's election, the Teamsters spend $3. For every $3 the AmericanMedical Association or the National Association of Realtors spends,the Teamsters spend $4.   Fulfilling Jackie Presser's dream that his union become a``political giant'' and believing firmly that money is the key, thegovernment-besieged Teamsters have amassed the largest campaignchest of any business, labor or special interest group in thenation.   ``Without money, you're going nowhere in the political arena inthis country,'' the late Teamsters president told the AFL-CI0 whenhe brought his union back into the labor federation a year ago.   The Teamsters, under new President William McCarthy, broke withthe AFL-CIO, at least politically, last week and endorsed GeorgeBush over Michael Dukakis.   Under Presser, the Teamsters' DRIVE (Democratic RepublicanIndependent Voter Education) fund grew from less than $250,000 in1980 into the nation's richest political action committee.   As of Sept. 1, the Teamsters' PAC had collected $7,692,850 fromthe union's 1.6 million members, most of it through dollar-a-weekpayroll deductions from 100,000 interstate truck drivers and UnitedParcel Service employees.   With DRIVE growing at a rate of $400,000 to $500,000 a month andincluding 15 other PACs operated by the some of its larger localsand state councils, the Teamsters stand to spend more than $10million before the 1988 election is over.   The biggest PACs in past elections _ the National Association ofRealtors and the American Medical Association _ had accumulated$4,841,363 and $4,759,178, respectively, as of July, according toFederal Election Commission records. The National RifleAssociation's Political Victory Fund stood at $1,993,665.   The primary impetus behind the geometric growth of theTeamsters' political spending was the deregulation of the truckingindustry in 1980.   The Teamsters found then they had only 26 allies in the Senatewhen they tried to block the move, and former union President RoyWilliams went to prison for five years for attempting to bribeformer Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., to derail the legislation.   Presser vowed that the union would never suffer that kind ofpolitical defeat again, a viewed echoed by McCarthy, a veteranBoston area labor leader.   ``We have to show our appreciation to those in Congress whosupport working men and women, and we do this best through DRIVE,''McCarthy told a meeting of East Coast Teamster leaders last monthat Hilton Head, S.C.   ``Because of deregulation, we don't have any trouble signing ourUPS and freight guys .. up for DRIVE,'' said Dave Sweeney, theTeamsters' legislative director.   ``They've seen all the freight companies going out of business,all the madness out there,'' Sweeney said. ``You don't have toconvince them we need to be politically active.''   High on the union's political agenda is legislation to outlawdouble-breasting _ the simultaneous operation of union andnon-union shops under the same ownership or management.   Despite the Teamsters' surprise endorsement of Bush last week,FEC records show 88 percent of their contributions to federalcandidates go to Democrats and 12 percent to Republicans _ aboutthe same ratio as organized labor as a whole.   The Teamsters had funneled some $1.6 million to 282 DemocraticHouse and Senate candidates and $190,000 to 52 Republicans as ofSept. 1, according to the latest government records.   Among the recipients: Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass, who got$5,000. Kennedy is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F.Kennedy, who put Teamster leaders like Jimmy Hoffa and WilliamPresser _ Jackie Presser's father _ in jail.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen has received $9,000 in Teamster money thisyear _ all of it before Dukakis tapped Bentsen as his running mateand all devoted to Bentsen's simultaneous Texas campaign forre-election to the Senate.   The Teamsters gave Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.,$5,000 when he was running for re-election to the Senate two yearsago.   Besides being incumbents, Quayle and Bentsen shared anothertrait common to beneficiaries of Teamsters largess: chairmanshipsof subcommittees and committees vital to the union's legislativeagenda.   Quayle was chairman of the Senate labor subcommittee at the timeand Bentsen now chairs the Senate Finance Committee responsible forshaping the nation's tax and trade laws.   Indirect Teamster political aid for voter registration, phonebanks and gubernatorial and state legislative candidates totaledmore than $2.5 million as of September, according to FEC records.   As of Sept. 1, the Teamsters' had a $3 million cash balance intheir DRIVE account.   Like many construction unions, the Teamsters are more inclinedthan most AFL-CIO affiliates and the federation's Committee onPolitical Education (COPE) to side with a friendly GOP incumbentover a Democratic challenger.   ``If a Republican supports you six or seven times out of 10, youought to be able to support him,'' Sweeney said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
