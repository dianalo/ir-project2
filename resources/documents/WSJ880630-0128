The message is that if a President doesn't want his officials harassed by political enemies in Congress armed with special prosecutors, it's up to him to do something about it.    Morrison v. Olson, contrary to all expectations, wasn't a split opinion. Justice Scalia was the sole dissenter. Chief Justice Rehnquist appointed himself to write the majority opinion, perhaps after counting noses and deciding that the statute was going to be upheld. If the decision diminishes the powers of the executive branch, at least Justice Rehnquist puts the best face on it.    &quot;We observe first that this case does not involve an attempt by Congress to increase its own powers at the expense of the executive branch,&quot; the Chief Justice wrote. Really? True, the court acknowledged, the Ethics in Government Act requires the attorney general to appoint an independent counsel even without any evidence of a crime. He can refuse a congressional demand to appoint a counsel only if, without any power to investigate, he can decide that there is no reasonable ground for further investigation.    But the court announced that it read the ethics act to say that &quot;the courts are specifically prevented from reviewing the attorney general's decision not to seek appointment.&quot; Justice Scalia noted in dissent that the act does not actually say this, but it is perhaps now the law. This means that as a matter of law anyway, the executive branch can end the institution of independent counsel by simply refusing ever to appoint one.    The opinion also addressed the problem of independent counsel who flout Justice Department prosecutorial guidelines. &quot;Most importantly, the attorney general retains the power to remove the counsel for 'good cause',&quot; the justices ruled. They added, somewhat obliquely, that &quot;the legislative history of the removal provision also makes clear that the attorney general may remove an independent counsel for 'misconduct.'&quot;    Justice Scalia wrote a brilliant dissent tearing into the majority's Panglossian view that somehow the executive branch really does keep control of the core function of prosecuting citizens. Saying that the attorney general can remove a prosecutor for good cause &quot;is somewhat like referring to shackles as an effective means of locomotion,&quot; Justice Scalia wrote. The reality is that removing a prosecutor would be political dynamite; as Justice Scalia put it, &quot;This statute is acrid with the smell of threatened impeachment.&quot;    Much as we hoped for a different result, it's important to note that a Supreme Court decision invalidating independent counsel would have been only a quick fix. The underlying problem would still remain. Washington has become a town where some combatants specialize in ruining the reputations of political enemies and moving political battles into the criminal courts. The independent counsel has become a blunt tool of prosecutorial politics.    Take the case at issue here. Theodore Olson ran Justice's Office of Legal Counsel when Congress was beating up on Anne Burford over Superfund. He advised that executive privilege protected some internal EPA documents. His reward was that three Democratic staffers of the House Judiciary Committee spent two years compiling a 3,000-page &quot;report&quot; demanding that the attorney general appoint an independent counsel. They got one, thus punishing Mr. Olson for daring to serve his client, the presidency.    Ironically, even independent counsel Alexia Morrison has admitted that &quot;standing in isolation . . . Mr. Olson's testimony of March 10, 1983, probably does not constitute a prosecutable violation of any federal criminal law.&quot; Yet she persists in spending more than $1 million in taxpayer funds to keep after Mr. Olson. If this is not the &quot;misconduct&quot; that Chief Justice Rehnquist had in mind, perhaps one further tactic would meet that definition. She threatened a &quot;protective indictment&quot; if Mr. Olson didn't waive his rights to the five-year statute of limitations, which should have run out March 10, 1988. By any normal standard, this is prosecutorial abuse.    Which brings us full circle. If the court is not going to save the presidency, who is? President Reagan to his great discredit has shown no willingness to confront Congress on this subject. He even signed the reauthorization of the ethics law. Mike Dukakis would have less to worry about with a Democratic Congress, but a George Bush presidency would be red meat from day one.    Mr. Bush says he wants to attract people who will help him revive the presidency. With a Congress bolstered by this ruling, this would be hazard duty indeed. Mr. Bush could pledge never to appoint an independent counsel or issue pre-emptive pardons for his appointees. But as Mr. Scalia suggests, the smell of cordite lingers in the air.
