The objectives of the research are to: study the beneficiationof coal by stripping with supercritical steam; and study the extractionof coal with supercritical aromatic hydrocarbons in mixtures with additives.Progress under the first objective is reported concerned with the studyof the kinetics of model sulfur compounds. A major part of this reportis concerned with the selective extraction of coal with supercriticalsolvents and reports all of the research and results in this phase ofthe second objective. The supercritical fluid chromatograph is operationaland it is being tested. A study of equations of state and their use indescribing supercritical extraction has begun. 40 refs., 73 figs., 10tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
