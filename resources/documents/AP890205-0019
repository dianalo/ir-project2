SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bitter cold that staggered Alaska and thenheaded south, ending five weeks of unusually warm weather in thenorthernmost state, is just the latest in a series of unusualweather events that have marked the past year.   Take, for example, the heat and drought that battered much of thenation last summer. That helped maintain a pattern of weatherdisasters in this country every 50 years.   Great blizzards staggered both the Great Plains and the Northeasta century ago in 1888, while the ``Long Island Express,'' one of theworst hurricanes to batter the Northeast, struck in 1938.   Of course, there have been plenty of weather-related disasters inother years too.   A look back at 1988 does show that the United States wasn't alonein facing odd weather during the year. Problems from heat to cold todrought to excessive moisture were felt around the world.   Were these events, known to meteorologists as weather anomalies,related to one another? Not in any obvious way, researchers say.   And how about the theory that gases added to the atmosphere arecausing a greenhouse-like warming of the planet?   Backers of that idea might find support in the droughts and heatin the United States and Argentina.   But it'll probably be hard to sell the greenhouse theory toresidents of Alaskan owns where the temperature dipped to 70 degreesand more below zero _ particularly since the greenhouse theory holdsthat any warming should be felt more strongly at the poles than inother areas.   Whether the hot summer, cold Alaskan January or other weatherrepresents any sort of trend will not likely be sorted out quickly.   The weather, after all, varies widely from year to year and``normal'' is just the average of those variations.   ``The drought was strong and got a lot of press, but these typesof deviations are going to happen each year somewhere,'' commentedRichard J. Tinker of the federal Climate Analysis Center.   At any rate, the heat and drought that struck this nation in thebreadbasket was probably the most significant weather event of theyear, being the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl year of1936, according to the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration.   The drought extended from the northern Rockies across the GreatPlains to the Gulf Coast and Southeast.   Crop yields were reduced and dryness remains a threat in manyareas, where farmers are hoping for winter snows to moisten theparched ground.   The drought was aggravated by extreme heat, with thenorth-central states and Canada experiencing the hottest summer inat least 38 years. Hundreds of heat records were topped beforerelief came in late August.   But while that hot spell attracted the headlines it was almostcompletely balanced, and the nation's average temperature for theyear came out near to normal.   Helping keep the balance were the bitter cold that swept acrossmuch of the nation in January 1988; a cold spell in the Northeast inApril and May; an unusually cool October in the Midwest and amid-December cold snap in the Northeast.   In addition to the severe heat and drought in the United Statesand Canada last summer, here is a look at some other unusual weatherconditions around the world during 1988:   _Drought struck the major farming area of northern Argentina inJune and has persisted for more than 30 weeks. It was accompaniedduring much of the period by warmer than normal temperatures,although that has now moderated somewhat. Affected in addition toArgentina are adjacent areas of other nations including Uruguay,Paraguay and Brazil.   _Dry conditions prevailed across much of east central Chinaduring the summer, broken by occasional extreme thunderstorms. Bythe end of August southern China was plagued by extraordinarily wetweather, followed by less than half the normal rainfall for the lastthree months of the year.   _In the middle of May a cold spell plagued the southerntwo-thirds of South America, lasting until the end of June andbringing freezing temperatures as far north as the coffee-growingregions of Brazil.   _Very hot weather baked south central Asia, with a severe heatwave in May and June. A good monsoon season brought plenty ofmoisture and moderated the heat over India, although the heavy rainstriggered some landslides and flooding.   _Spring was extremely wet over Europe from Scandinavia toSwitzerland, although the problem had moderated by May. Unusuallymoist conditiones continued to plague Scotland through September,however.   _Southeastern Siberia, northeastern China and Korea had unusuallywarm weather from October through December.   _Torrential rains struck Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe inFebruary and persisted through April in some areas.   _January and February of 1988 were unusually mild across most ofEurope with the warmest weather over the United Kingdom and CentralEurope.   _However, November and December proved unusually cold overEastern Europe and the Middle East. Winter storms with snow and highwinds ranged from Denmark to Germany to Greece and even the MiddleEast.   _Australia was hot and dry for the first three months of the yearbefore cooler temperatures and rainfall moderated conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
