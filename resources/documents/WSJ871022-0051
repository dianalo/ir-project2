Brokers were answering phones again, and rising prices calmed many individuals, who for two days had been unable to sell shares at any price.    By noon the OTC market was operating almost normally, and prices rebounded as investors -- largely institutions -- rushed to take advantage of bargains from Tuesday's OTC sell-off. Investors snapped up a record 288,059,700 shares as the Composite Index for the National Association of Securities Dealers' automated quotations system, or Nasdaq, rallied 7.3%, making up most of Tuesday's loss.    Large institutional issues such as Apple Computer Corp., up $6.25 to $40.75, and Liz Claiborne Inc., up $5 to $19.50, traded in record volume. Some of the smaller issues smashed in Tuesday's collapse, however, remained lifeless.    By the time most individuals learned of Monday's market crash, it was over. Then, traders say, the media may have aggravated the situation. &quot;From what I heard on Monday night on television, the end of the world had come. Every analyst was 100% negative; there was nothing to do but sell,&quot; says Raymond Principe, an individual investor in Hopewell, Va., who stayed up all night to watch the doomsday story unfold on network television.    And Tuesday morning, across the country, small investors -- the biggest holders of OTC shares -- woke up with plans to sell. Many found they couldn't. Brokerage firms who sold them the little OTC stocks weren't answering their telephones, and other firms refused to open quick accounts to permit sale of the shares elsewhere. Investors watched helplessly as prices of their little issues plummeted.    The Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday dived 9% even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indexes of large stocks held mostly by institutions were on the rebound. Many small OTC issues traded much as did Cheyenne Software Inc., a Roslyn, N.Y., custom designer of computer software that sold for $24 a share only a few weeks ago, had already tumbled to $11.375 by Tuesday, when it crashed throughout the day to $4 a share. Like many tiny issues that were crushed, Cheyenne did not rebound yesterday.    Bizarre price quotes through the day Tuesday, available to individuals through dial-up services, compounded the problem. &quot;It was goofy. Nothing made any sense. I figured (the quotes) were mistakes,&quot; says Mr. Principe.    Most, however, weren't mistakes. Many brokers, unwilling or unable to take more losses, were doing what is called &quot;locking&quot; their price quotes to other brokers. This means they they were putting out on the Nasdaq terminals offers to buy stocks from other brokers at high prices -- often even higher than the price at which they were technically willing to sell shares, and then they weren't answering their trading telephones. This kept the &quot;official&quot; quote for the stock -- heavily owned by the broker -- high, while the broker actually didn't have to buy any shares at that price.    As a result, those brokers who were answering their phones were confronted with absurd situations. Steven Wright, a trader for Brokers Securities Inc., an OTC discount brokerage firm, says the firm was selling stock to other brokers all day Tuesday at prices much higher than those quoted by many other firms on the Nasdaq system. &quot;They couldn't get them to answer their phones,&quot; he says.    At one point, he says, shares of Farm Fresh Inc. were offered on the Nasdaq terminals by several other brokers at $10.50. &quot;I had calls from firms buying at our $11-a-share price, because they couldn't reach the other brokers,&quot; he says, even to buy.    &quot;Fifty percent of all the markets were locked like that all day&quot; Tuesday, he says. Even so, Nasdaq volume hit a record Tuesday, as individual investors unloaded what they could.    Yesterday Nasdaq took a firm hand. A message went out on traders' terminals warning that Nasdaq was monitoring all trading today for &quot;locked&quot; prices and that it would &quot;take action&quot; against any brokers locking prices, not answering phones or not honoring bids.    That, plus the hunting by some institutions for bargain-priced OTC shares as other markets rallied, was enough to unlock the bids and open up the system. By noon most brokers were answering their telephones.    Douglas Parrillo, senior vice president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, says the NASD intends to examine everything that has happened in Nasdaq trading for the past few days &quot;to be prepared for any other possible occurence.&quot; But he adds, &quot;the NASD found nothing to cause it to close down any brokers and no significant capital problems&quot; during the chaos.    Issues investors snapped up most heavily in their OTC bargain hunting yesterday ranged from big banks, insurance companies and utilities to technology issues and retailers. First Union Corp., a big Charlotte, N.C., bank holding company, rebounded $3.25 a share to $20.625; Safeco Corp., a large property-casualty insurer, rose $3.75 a share to $30.50; MCI Communications Corp., was up $1.625 to $9.50; Citizens Utilities Co., Stamford, Conn., was up $6.25 a share to $32, and Genentech Inc., the biggest Nasdaq biotechnology issue, rose $6.25 a share to $32. </TEXT></DOC>
