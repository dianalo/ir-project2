Overview of the Rule 1. <T3>Commercial Practice Restrictions. </T3>Some state-imposed restrictionson the commercial practice \1\<NOTE/> of optometry cause significant injury to consumers. Whilejustified as necessary to protect consumers, these restrictions actuallywork to deprive consumers of necessary eye care, restrict consumer choice,and impede innovation in the eye care industry. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Optometric practices range across a continuum from whatcan be characterized as strictly traditional (e.g., solo practitoner operatingin an office building under own name) to highly commercial (e.g., largechain optometric firm, with offices in many states). For purposes of thisproceeding, an optometrist is considered to be in ``commercial practice''if he or she is associated with or employed by a nonoptometrist, uses atrade name, operates more than a single office, or practices at a mercantilelocation. The monetary cost_likely to be millions of dollars annually_is great. Overhalf of all Americans and more than 90 percent of elderly consumers usecorrective eyewear, and over eight billion dollars was spent on eye examsand eyewear in 1983.\2\<NOTE/> A significant proportion of these costs can be attributedto the inefficiencies of an industry protected from competition by stateregulation. A study done by the FTC's Bureau of Economics shows that pricesfor eye care are 18 percent higher in markets where chain firms are totallyrestricted than in markets where chain firms operate freely. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ NAOO, H-78, at 7 (figure derived from the annual NationalConsumer Eyewear study conducted by the Optical Manufacturers Association).The NAOO anticipated that 1985 sales would exceed nine billion dollars.<ITAG tagnum="28">All documents on the rulemaking record have been given alphanumericdesignations based upon the system established by the Presiding Officer.A full explanation of these designations is given at the beginning of Bureauof Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, Ophthalmic Practice Rules:State Restrictions on Commercial Practice, (1986), L-1 (hereinafter referredto as ``Final Staff Report''). For example, documents in the H categoryare written comments filed by providers or sellers of ophthalmic goodsor services and by ophthalmic organizations. Documents in the J categoryare written witness statements, transcripts of the hearings and hearingexhibits. Hearing transcripts, which appear on the rulemaking record asJ-71, are cited by page number (e.g., ``Tr. 999''). </ITAG>State restrictions on commercial practice are pervasive. Some restrictionsare statutory. Others are found in regulations promulgated by state boardsof optometry.\3\<NOTE/> This rule declares unfair four specific types of state restrictionson competition among optometrists and other vision care providers: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In still other cases, attorney general opinions, judicialinterpretations, and board interpretations may reveal restrictions notapparent from the face of the statute or regulation. (1) <T3>Restrictions on Affiliations With Nonoptometrists. </T3>Most stateshave one or more restrictions on lay affiliations. Such restrictions takemany forms, including restrictions on employment of optometrists by businesscorporations or nonoptometrists, on the forming of partnerships betweenoptometrists and nonoptometrists, on the splitting of optometrists' professionalfees with nonoptometrists (which, in effect, can prohibit joint-ownershipor equity-participation agreements), and on the forming of franchise agreementsand landlord-tenant agreements between optometrists and nonoptometrists,including agreements under which rental payments are based on a percentageof gross revenue.\4\<NOTE/> Some states also prohibit such corporate affiliations byprohibiting nonoptometrists from exercising any control over the businessaspects of an optometric practice.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The sharing of profits or of gross revenues is an integralpart of many of these business relationships. For example, partnershipagreements involve distribution of income on a percentage basis. An essentialelement of franchise agreements is payment of a percentage of gross revenuesby the franchisee to the franchiser, often referred to as a ``royalty.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Some degree of lay control over the business aspects ofa practice is an essential element of these relationships. (2) <T3>Restrictions on practice in mercantile locations.</T3>\6\<NOTE/> Over twenty states impose one or more bans that appear toexplicitly prohibit the practice of optometry in mercantile locations.The most common ban explicitly prohibits optometrists from practicing inor leasing space from a retail establishment, such as a department storeor optical store. Most states that prohibit optometrists from practicingin a retail establishment permit optometrists to locate in or next to thatbusiness only if there is a separate entrance to a public street or hallway,in what is known as a ``two-door'' or ``side-by-side'' arrangement. Inaddition, several states appear to restrict practice in shopping malls.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ As used herein, ``mercantile location'' refers to shoppingmalls and to retail establishments such as department stores and opticaloutlets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Two states, Rhode Island and Alaska, apparently prohibitshopping mall practices altogether. While Rhode Island's prohibition doesnot mention shopping malls explicitly, it does bar optometrists from practicingin a building where over 50% of the remaining space is rented under percentageleases. Since such leases are almost universally used in shopping centers,J. Solish, Counsel, R.H. Teagle Corp., Tr. 1371; C. Callsen, NAOO, Tr.353, the effect of this provision is to inhibit optometric practice inshopping centers. In Alaska, no such ban appears in statute or regulation.However, there is evidence that the Board of Optometry enforces such arestriction. J. Ingalls, President, Western States Optical, J-54, at 3-4.(3) <T3>Restrictions on branch offices.</T3> Many states restrict the numberof offices that an optometrist may own or operate. Some impose flat limitationson the number of offices that an optometrist may open,\8\<NOTE/> while others indirectly impose limits by requiring an optometristto be present a certain percentage of the time a branch office is open.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See, e.g., Ky. Rev. Stat. section 320.310(3) (1983). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See, e.g., Or. Admin. R. section 852-10-030(5) (1984).(4) <T3>Restrictions on the use of trade names.</T3>\1\\0\<NOTE/> Trade name restrictions generally take one of three forms.First, some states explicitly ban any use of trade names by optometrists.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Second, some states specify that trade names must includecertain words.\1\\2\<NOTE/> Third, several states require that the names of all optometristspracticing under a trade name or at any advertised location must be disclosedin all advertisements that use the trade name.\1\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Friedman v. Rogers, </T3>440 U.S. 1 (1979), that a Texas statute prohibitingthe use of trade names did not violate the First Amendment, does not precludea Commission finding of unfairness regarding trade name bans. The Commissionapplies a different standard for purposes of an unfairness analysis undersection 5 of the FTCA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ See, e.g., Fla. Stat. section 463.014(1)(a); Ind. Admin.R.1-4-1(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ For example, California requires that all trade namescontain the word ``optometrist'' or ``optometric.'' Cal. Bus. andamp; Prof.Code sections 3125 (b) and (c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. section 336.200.As of 1985, at least 44 states had one or more of these four types of restrictions.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Thirty-nine states prohibited employer-employee or otherbusiness affiliations between optometrists and persons who are not optometrists,including partnerships, joint-ownership or equity-participation agreements,franchise agreements, landlord-tenant agreements, and other similar affiliations.At least 19 states limited the number of branch offices which may be ownedor operated by optometrists, often limiting optometrists to one or twobranch offices. Thirty states restricted optometrists from practicing inmercantile locations such as shopping malls, department stores, and otherretail establishments. At least 32 states prohibited the use of nondeceptivetrade names by optometrists. Each of these restrictions prevents or restrictsthe development of alternatives to the traditional solo practice.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ See charts in Final Staff Report, L-1, at 33-46, fora detailed breakdown of state regulation of the practice of optometry.The statistics on commercial practice restrictions cited here and elsewherein the Statement are based on an analysis of state regulatory practiceas of 1985. A sampling of state statutes and regulations, as of October1988, confirmed that one or more of the restraints at issue here continueto exist in a majority of the states.Evidence gathered during a lengthy investigation and an extensive rulemakingproceeding includes two Commission-sponsored surveys, additional surveyevidence, and expert economic, testimonial, and documentary evidence. Thatsubstantial body of evidence demonstrates that these restrictions raiseprices to consumers and, by reducing the frequency with which consumersobtain vision care, decrease the overall quality of care provided in themarket. The rulemaking record establishes that the presence of commercialoptometric firms lowers the cost of eye care to patients of both commercialand noncommercial optometrists. The evidence also indicates that theserestrictions do not provide offsetting quality-related benefits to consumers.The Commission has concluded that these restrictions are unfair acts orpractices within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade CommissionAct and are appropriately remedied by the Trade Regulation Rule promulgatedtoday.2. <T3>Prescription Release. </T3>The rule continues to require that optometristsand ophthalmologists release eyeglass lens prescriptions to their patientsupon completion of an eye examination. The Commission considered a staffproposal to modify this provision to require that prescriptions be releasedonly upon request. After weighing the evidence, we conclude that thereis a continuing need for the ``automatic release'' component of the requirement.However, technical changes have been made in the rule language in orderto make clear that this provision is directed only at prescriptions foreyeglass lenses and creates no obligation concerning the release of prescriptionsfor contact lenses.B. History of the Proceeding.This proceeding grew out of an investigation begun in 1975 into state andprivate restraints on advertising of ophthalmic goods and services. Thefirst phase of the investigation culminated with the promulgation in 1978of the Trade Regulation Rule on the Advertising of Ophthalmic Goods andServices.\1\\5\<NOTE/> As the investigation progressed, the staff began to accumulateevidence that restrictions on advertising were not the only public restraintsthat appeared to limit competition, increase prices, and reduce the qualityof eye care provided to the public. The second phase of this inquiry focusedon the commercial practice restrictions described above.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ 16 CFR Part 456 (hereinafter cited as ``Eyeglasses Rule'').The Commission found public and private bans on nondeceptive advertisingby vision care providers and the providers' failure to release eyeglasslens prescriptions to be unfair acts or practices in violation of section5 of the FTC Act. The rule prohibited bans on nondeceptive advertisingand required vision care providers to furnish copies of prescriptions toconsumers after eye examinations. Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia in <T3>American Optometric Association v. FTC, </T3>626 F.2d 896 (D.C. Cir.1980), upheld the prescription release requirement but remanded the advertisingportions of the Eyeglasses Rule for further consideration in light of theSupreme Court decision in <T3>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </T3>433 U.S. 350 (1977). After furtherconsideration, the Commission has addressed the few remaining advertisingrestrictions through administrative litigation rather than rulemaking.To obtain further evidence on these issues, staff conducted two comprehensivestudies. The first, published in 1980 by the Bureau of Economics, comparedthe price and quality of optometric services in restrictive and nonrestrictivemarkets.\16\<NOTE/> The second study, published in 1982 by the Bureaus of ConsumerProtection and Economics, compared the price and quality of cosmetic contactlens fitting services of commercial optometrists and other provider groups.\17\<NOTE/> At the same time, the staff conducted a study measuring compliancewith the prescription release requirement of the Eyeglasses Rule.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Bureau of Economics, Federal Trade Commission, Restrictionson Advertising and Commercial Practice in the Professions: The Case ofOptometry (1980), B-2-31 (hereinafter cited as ``BE Study''). That studyshowed that commercial practice restrictions resulted in higher pricesfor eyeglasses and eye examinations, but did not increase their quality.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Bureaus of Consumer Protection and Economics, FederalTrade Commission, A Comparative Analysis of Cosmetic Lens Fitting by Ophthalmologists,Optometrists, and Opticians (1983), B-5-1 (hereinafter cited as ``ContactLens Study''). That study showed that commercial optometrists charged significantlylower prices for fitting cosmetic contact lenses and fitted such lensesat least as well as other fitters of contact lenses.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Market Facts Public Sector Research Group, FTC EyeglassesStudy: An Evaluation of the Prescription Release Requirement (1981) (hereinaftercited as ``Market Facts Study'').In July 1980 staff published the results of its investigation on commercialpractice restrictions in an initial staff report.\19\<NOTE/> Based on this report and other evidence gathered, the Commissionpublished an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR'') in December1980, that requested comments on the issues presented by the investigationand on what action, if any, the Commission should take.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission,State Restrictions on Vision Care Providers: The Effect on Consumers (1980),B-2-1 (hereinafter cited as ``1980 Staff Report'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ 45 FR 79,823 (1980). During the 60-day comment period,247 comments were received.Based on the survey evidence, the initial staff report, and the commentsreceived in response to the ANPR, the Commission published on January 4,1985, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking initiating this rulemaking proceeding(``Eyeglasses II'').\21\<NOTE/> During the proceeding, 243 written comments were received:12 from consumers and consumer groups; 159 from optometrists, sellers ofophthalmic goods, and their professional associations; 69 from federal,state, and local government officials; and 3 from members of the academiccommunity. Ninety-four persons testified during three weeks of public hearings.\22\<NOTE/> Twenty-four rebuttal comments were filed in response to thattestimony.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ 50 FR 598 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Some organizations sponsored several witnesses; 74 organizationsor individuals presented testimony.The staff reviewed the entire record and published its final report inOctober 1986.\23\<NOTE/> The report recommended the promulgation of a rule that wouldeliminate the four types of commercial practice restrictions describedabove and modify the prescription release provisions in the EyeglassesRule. The Presiding Officer's Report, released in December 1986,\24\<NOTE/> recommended against adopting a rule that would proscribecommercial practice restrictions, and also recommended against modifyingthe prescription release requirements of the Eyeglasses Rule. After reviewof these comments, the staff submitted its final recommendations to theCommission in July 1987.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Final Staff Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ James P.

Evidentiary Standards for an Unfairness Rulemaking \27\</ITAG>The Commission<NOTE/> requires that a preponderance of the evidence support thefactual propositions underlying a determination that an existing act orpractice is legally unfair. Before promulgating an unfairness rule theCommission requires answers to the following questions: (1) Is the actor practice prevalent? (2) Does the act or practice injure consumers? (3)Is the proposed rule likely to reduce that injury? (4) Is the injury toconsumers outweighed by countervailing benefits that flow from the actor practice at issue? and (5) Can consumers reasonably avoid the injury?\28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ See infra section III. A. for a discussion of the statutorybasis and evolution of the Commission's unfairness authority.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>American Financial Services Ass'n v. Federal Trade Commission, </T3>767F.2d 957, 971 (1985); Rule on Sale of Used Motor Vehicles, Statement ofBasis and Purpose, 49 FR 45692, 45703 (1984); Credit Practices Rule, Statementof Basis and Purpose, 49 FR 7740, 7742 (1984); Letter from Federal TradeCommission to Senators Wendell H. Ford and John C. Danforth (Dec. 17, 1980)(hereinafter cited as ``Unfairness Statement''). In issuing the CreditPractices Rule, the Commission acknowledged that the evidence necessaryto answer these questions will vary depending on the circumstances of eachrulemaking and the characteristics of the industry involved. 49 FR 7740,7742 n. 4.As a matter of policy, the Commission has set an even higher standard forpromulgation of a rule that directly challenges state law. Out of deferenceto the principles of federalism, the Commission will take such action asa remedy of last resort, appropriate only if substantial consumer injuryis clearly shown; the benefits of the state laws are minimal or absent;and the states are not acting on their own to change the laws.\29\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Letter from Federal Trade Commission to Senator RobertPackwood, Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation,United States Senate (March 5, 1982).In this proceeding, the record clearly supports affirmative answers toeach of the above-mentioned questions. First, at least 44 states have oneor more of the four types of restrictions at issue here. Second, comprehensiveand reliable evidence shows that the restrictions cause significant harmto consumers by increasing prices and reducing the frequency with whichconsumers obtain care. Third, by declaring that such restrictions are unfair,the rule removes such restrictions and thereby eliminates the harm to consumers.Fourth, comprehensive and reliable evidence indicates that the restrictionsdo not provide consumer benefits since they fail to increase the qualityof care received by consumers. Fifth, consumers cannot avoid the adverseeffect of these state-imposed and state-enforced restrictions.\30\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ See infra section VI.A.The Commission has a responsibility to see that the best evidence reasonablyavailable is included on a rulemaking record before promulgating a rule.\31\<NOTE/> The best evidence will often be surveys or other methodologicallysound quantitative analyses. The Commission may also consider other reliableevidence and expert testimony.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Trade Regulation Rule on Sale of Used Motor Vehicles,Statement of Basis and Purpose, 49 FR 45692, 45703 (1984); Credit PracticesRule, Statement of Basis and Purpose, 49 FR 7740, 7742 (1984).The quantity and quality of evidence in this proceeding supports promulgationof the rule under standards set by the Commission and the courts. The needfor the rule is demonstrated by the BE and Contact Lens Studies.\32\<NOTE/> The rule is further supported by additional studies, by documentaryand testimonial evidence, and by the absence of any substantial or persuasivecontrary evidence. The cumulative impact of this evidence persuades usthat the rule is necessary and will provide substantial benefits to consumers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ See infra section II.D. for a detailed discussion ofthe methodology used in these studies.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Evidence Regarding Harm to Consumers Caused by Commercial PracticeRestrictions. </ITAG>1.<T3> Higher Prices.</T3> The evidence on the record demonstrates that commercialpractice restrictions raise prices for eye care goods and services.\33\<NOTE/> By impeding competition from commercial firms, the restrictionsresult in higher average prices for both commercial and traditional practitionersand at all levels of quality. This conclusion is supported by a preponderanceof the evidence, which shows: (1) That average prices for eye exams andeyeglasses are lower in markets with chain firms than in markets withoutchain firms; (2) that chain firms and other large-volume providers chargesignificantly lower prices than noncommercial providers; and (3) that eachof the restrictions imposes unnecessary costs on commercial practice thatimpede its development and raise prices to consumers. No reliable evidencecontradicts these conclusions.\34\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 157-178.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Id. at 165-178. The BE Study found that prices for eye exams and eyeglasses were 18% higherin markets without chain firms than in markets with chain firms. In marketswith chain firms, both traditional and commercial optometrists chargedlower prices, and prices were lower at all levels of quality.\35\<NOTE/> An earlier study by Professors Lee and Alexandra Benham alsoconcluded that prices of eyeglasses were substantially higher in stateswith restrictions than in states without restrictions.\36\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Id. at 101-107.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Benham and Benham,<T3> Regulating Through the Professions: A Perspective on Information Control,</T3>18 J. L. andamp; Econ. 421 (1975), B-2-29. See Final Staff Report, L-1, at164 for a further discussion of the Benhams' study. In the 1980 Staff Reportand the Final Staff Report, staff acknowledged several potential methodologicalshortcomings with the Benham data which indicate that the study, standingalone, would not be sufficient to support this rulemaking. Final StaffReport, L-1, at 165; 1980 Staff Report, B-2-1, at 46, 58-59.

See also 1980 Staff Report, B-2-1, at 58-59. Additional evidence demonstrating that commercial firms_generally chainfirms or other large-volume providers_charge significantly lower pricesfor equivalent quality goods and services than noncommercial optometristsincludes: (1) The Contact Lens Study, which found that commercial optometristscharged significantly less for cosmetic contact lens fitting than noncommercialoptometrists; \37\<NOTE/> (2) a survey submitted by the California Optometric Association,which found that chain optometric firms charged less for eye exams thanprivate optometrists; \38\<NOTE/> and (3) extensive documentary and other evidence demonstratingthat large-volume providers frequently take advantage of economies of scaleto charge lower prices for equivalent goods and services.\39\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ The results showed that commercial optometrists chargedprices that were on average 20% lower than noncommercial optometrists andover 30% lower than ophthalmologists.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Consumer Study of Optometric Practices in Metro-AtlantaArea, J-67(a) (Attachment to Statement of California Optometric Ass'n)(hereinafter cited as ``Atlanta Survey''). The survey was conducted byJohn H. Thomas and Associates, Atlanta, Georgia. See Final Staff Report,L-1, at 161-163 for a further description of this survey.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ For example, in 1982, the California Department of ConsumerAffairs estimated that the cost differences attributable to economies ofscale during the first 10 years of practice between an independent solopractitioner and a corporation could range from $12 to $13 per customer.Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California, Commercial PracticesRestrictions in Optometry 8-11, 13 (1982), J-24(b). See also Final StaffReport, L-1, at 59-67, 177-178.Finally, as summarized below, the record demonstrates that each of thespecific restrictions at issue here imposes unnecessary costs on optometricproviders and hinders the development of high-volume practices, resultingin fewer such firms in the market, higher prices to consumers, and decreasedaccess to eye care.While the studies on the record do not separately describe the effectsof each particular commercial practice restriction, the record containsan abundance of other evidence that supports a Commission finding thateach of the four types of restrictions inhibits or restricts the formationand expansion of high-volume optometric practices.\40\<NOTE/> In addition, the record establishes how the restrictionsdecrease efficiency and increase prices for volume practitioners that manageto enter the market in spite of the restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 49-100.(1) Restrictions on lay associations prohibit optometrists from obtainingcapital from nonoptometrists by entering into partnerships, joint ownershipagreements or other associations with such persons or entities, a constraintwhich inhibits capital development. This, in turn, impedes the developmentof large-scale practices that can take advantage of volume purchase discountsand other economies of scale.\41\<NOTE/> These restrictions contribute to higher prices by excludingor deterring volume practitioners from entering the market and by preventingpractitioners in the market from operating at the most efficient level.\42\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ The record indicates that the use of volume discountsby high-volume practices can reduce significantly the costs of equipment,material, and supplies. For example, the NAOO stated that through the useof volume discounts, an office could be equipped for about two-thirds ofthe standard retail price. Moreover, materials such as frames and lensescan be discounted as much as 25% when purchased in volume. See Final StaffReport, L-1, at 60-61. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Id. at 57-67. (2) Restrictions on practicing in mercantile locations, such as departmentor drug stores, also raise prices to consumers by inhibiting the formationof high-volume commercial practices. Mercantile locations, which are generallymore convenient to consumers, generate a high volume of consumer traffic.Restrictions on practicing in mercantile locations may also impose unnecessaryspace, construction, or personnel costs that must be passed on to consumers.\43\<NOTE/> These burdens fall both on optometric chain firms and onindividual practitioners. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ For example, in those states that mandate a two-dooror side-by-side arrangement, optometrists typically must maintain an officethat is separate from the optical dispensary and that also has a separateentrance to a public street, corridor, or hallway. This results in higherconstruction costs, requires more space and thus more rent, and increasesfrontage costs. <ITAG tagnum="28">The NAOO estimates that the cost of constructing, equipping, and fixturinga side-by-side office is 15-20% higher than for an equivalent one-dooroffice. NAOO, H-78, at 35. This cost, which typically might amount to $10,000per office, includes duplicating the heating, cooling, bathroom, waitingroom, and other facilities. See also Final Staff Report, L-1, at 84-88.</ITAG>(3) Restrictions on branch offices create barriers to expansion both byindividual optometrists and by lay optometric firms. These restrictionsreduce the total volume of patients that a practice might otherwise beable to serve. This reduced volume of patients prevents optometrists fromtaking advantage of economies of scale that arise from volume purchasingdiscounts and reduced per office advertising costs. Also lost are the potentialsavings that multi-branch practices may achieve through more efficientmanagement techniques.\44\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ For example, branch office restrictions may prevent optometricfirms from employing or entering into other business relationships withoptometrists at more than the permitted number of locations. NAOO, H-78,at 60. Each office that the optometrist is scheduled to work in is considereda branch for purposes of these restrictions, so that firms cannot schedulean optometrist to practice in more than the permitted number of locations.This may prevent these firms from efficiently distributing their optometriststo best meet the needs of the firms' various offices. See Final Staff Report,L-1, at 74-77.(4) Bans on trade name practice and advertising deprive consumers of valuableinformation and increase consumer search costs. Trade names are of valueto consumers because, over time, the names come to reflect the cumulativeexperience that consumers have had with a particular firm. As a result,trade names are a valuable asset to firms, and restrictions on their usehinder the growth and development of optometric firms. Trade name bansalso make it difficult for high-volume operators to advertise multipleoutlets and to allocate advertising expenses over those outlets.\4\\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 95-97.  The record also establishes \4\\6\<NOTE/> that state laws which require that all trade name advertisementsinclude the names of all optometrists practicing at a given advertisedlocation or practicing under the advertised trade name effectively banmuch nondeceptive trade name advertising. Thus these restrictions havea similar detrimental effect on consumers as outright bans on trade nameusage and advertising.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ The evidence shows that the cost of disclosing thenames of all optometrists practicing under a trade name is so burdensomeas to preclude the effective use of trade names under many circumstances.Similarly, the cost of disclosing the names of all optometrists at particularlyadvertised locations effectively prevents nondeceptive trade name usagein such advertisements under some circumstances.

Many states have enacted more than one of these restrictions.\4\\7\<NOTE/> While each of these restrictions may impede the growth andefficiency of chain firms or volume practices, a combination of restrictionsmay completely bar their entry.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ At least 26 states have at least three of these restrictions.<T3>See</T3> charts in Final Staff Report, L-1, at 33-46.  The Presiding Officer also found that the record demonstrated that pricesfor optometric goods and services are significantly lower in nonrestrictivemarkets than in restrictive markets.\4\\8\<NOTE/> Commenters did not seriously dispute the evidence that large-volumepractitioners can achieve economies of scale unavailable to smaller practitioners,\4\\9\<NOTE/> nor did they submit any reliable studies that contradictedthe price findings of the BE and Contact Lens Studies.\5\\0\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ Presiding Officer's Report, L-2, at 182-186.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ Some commenters pointed to limited instances in whichsmaller-volume practitioners may achieve economies of scale. <T3>See</T3> e.g., Reponse of the COA to Dept. of Consumer Affairs Report,K-12, at 6 (attachment to Rebuttal of the COA) and Post-record commentof AOA, M-176, at 454. However, even if small discounts are available tosmall-scale practitioners, that does not contradict the fact that largerdiscounts may be available to high-volume practitioners.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 165-171. Some surveyevidence was presented by the COA and the AOA that ostensibly showed thatcommercial firms do not charge less and may even charge more than noncommercialoptometrists. For instance, the COA claimed that the Atlanta Survey's findingson ``mark-ups'' showed that ``alleged corporate efficiencies (<T3>e.g.,</T3> savings through volume discounts) were not being passedon to consumers'' because all the provider groups had equivalent ``mark-ups''on materials. However, this ``mark-up'' data provided no useful insightinto the relative prices charged by the different provider groups becauseof considerable variation in the wholesale costs of the frames and lensespurchased for the survey. <T3>Id</T3> at 165-68. The AOA also attempted to rely on some data froma <T3>20/20</T3> magazine survey showing that average billings were higherfor optometric practices with annual sales greater than $200,000 a yearthan for practices with lower annual sales. However, this survey failsto provide meaningful data about differences between chain and nonchainfirms. <T3>Id.</T3> at 169-170. It also fails to provide meaningful data aboutdifferences between low-volume practices and high-volume practices, asthat term has been used in this proceeding_<T3>i.e.,</T3> multi-optometrist, multi-office practice. See Rebuttal Statementof R. Bond, FTC economist, L-18, at 15 n. 6. As explained by the authorof the <T3>20/20</T3> article, each group (both over $200,000 and under $200,000)most probably includes both chain and independent operations. It is unclearwhether the reported gross sales volume refers to per-office volume orper-company volume. If the data is <T3>per-office</T3> gross sales, the data cannot be used to distinguishlow-volume firms from those with a significantly larger volume since largechains may have per-office volume above or below $200,000, while privatepractitioners may also be in either category. (This data was calculatedbased upon figures in Rebuttal Statement of NAOO, H-78a, at 11 and in OphthalmicPractice Rulemaking Statement and Exhibits_Robert R. Nathan Associates,Inc., J.-66(A), at Vol. II, Ex. 1, Appendix E at E-3 (hereinafter referredto as ``Nathan Study''). If the data is <T3>per company</T3>, $200,000 is too low a figure to provide a meaningfuldistinction between high and low volume. Many solo practitioners have thisvolume, but some chain firms have annual sales in the billions. Further,the <T3>20/20</T3> article noted that in this sample, more smaller practicesadvertised than larger ones; only 40 percent of larger practices advertised.``One probable reason would be the infrequent advertising of many largeophthalmological and optometric practices which still deem advertisingto be unprofessional.'' <T3>20/20</T3> Article; Nathan Study, J-66(a) at Vol. II, Ex. II, AppendixE, at E-2, E-6. This indicates that many traditional private practitionersand small group practices were included in the ``over-$200,000'' group.  2. <T3>Less Care. </T3>Commercial practice restrictions harm consumers notonly by raising prices but also by decreasing the overall quality of carereceived by consumers. The record evidence indicates that, as a resultof the higher prices in restrictive markets, consumers obtain eye careless frequently than they otherwise would.\51\<NOTE/> Some consumers forego eye care entirely, while others delaythe purchase of eyeglasses and eye exams. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Professors James Begun and Lee Benham stressed the importanceof frequency of eye care as an aspect of quality and stated that therecan be little doubt that the restrictions result in reduced frequency ofvision care purchases. <T3>See </T3>J. Begun, Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, K-1,Exhibit 12 (Attachment to Rebuttal Statement of NAOO); Rebuttal Statementof Lee Benham, Professor, Washington University, K-17, at 2; A. Beckenstein,Professor, University of Virginia, at A-7 (Appendix A to Rebuttal Statementof NAOO). Consumers Union stated that removal of the restrictions willallow more frequent eye exams and improve patient health because more consumerswill be able to afford the vision care and eyeglasses they need.

Testifying infavor of Medicare coverage for eye care, the AOA told a Congressional committeein 1976 that many elderly persons go without adequate vision care becauseof its cost.\52\<NOTE/> In that Congressional testimony, the AOA also provided evidencethat uncorrected vision problems can lead to serious injury to older consumers.According to the AOA, 85 percent of all serious injuries sustained by persons65 and older are caused by falls; 25 percent of these relate directly touncorrected vision problems. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ Medical Appliances for the Elderly: Needs and Costs,Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Health and Long-term Care of the HouseSelect Comm. on Aging, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 155 (1976) (Statement of theAOA), B-2-36. Survey evidence also demonstrates that higher prices result in reducedpurchases of eye care. Based on the results of an extensive nationwidesurvey, Professors Lee and Alexandra Benham found that significantly fewerindividuals purchased eyeglasses in a given year in states with higherprices than in states with lower prices.\53\<NOTE/> In 1979, a survey of 1,254 families sponsored by GeneralMills found that families had cut back on annual medical checkups, neweyeglasses, dental treatment, and various preventive health care servicesbecause of inflation.\54\<NOTE/> Finally, Public Health Service data indicate that annualpurchase and repair of eyeglasses increases with family income.\55\<NOTE/> This evidence indicates that economic considerations influencevision care expenditures, and that people are likely to cut back such expendituresas prices rise. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Benham and Benham, <T3>Regulating Through the Professions: A Perspective on Information Control,</T3>18 J.L. andamp; Econ. 421, 438 (1975), B-2-29.

Very few proponents of the restrictions addressed the question of the frequencyof eye care purchases. While some pointed to alleged shortcomings of thesurvey data discussed above, none of the alleged shortcomings prevent theCommission from concluding that commercial practice restrictions, whichraise the price of eye care, lead to reduced purchases of eye care.\56\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ For example, some commenters criticized the methodologyof the Benhams' survey and claimed that none of the surveys showed thatcommercial practice restrictions caused reduced eye care purchases. SeePost-record comment of AOA, M-176, at 422-33. See also Nathan Study, J-66(a),Vol. I, Exh. 1, at 89 n. 1. However, we are not persuaded that the allegedflaws in the Benhams' survey undercut the findings that, in general, higherprices of eye care lead to reduced consumer purchases. <T3>See </T3>Staff's final Recommedations, 0-1(b), at 12-14. While theAOA acknowledged that the surveys showed that inflation, recession, andavailable income affect consumer decision-making, it claimed that the surveysdid not show that commercial practice restrictions, in particular, resultin reduced purchases of eye care. However, because these surveys show that,in general, higher prices of eye care lead to reduced consumer purchasesand because other evidence on the record shows that commercial practicerestrictions lead to higher prices in the market, we can conclude thatcommercial practive restrictions result in reduced purchases of eye care.A few commenters did state that no one is going without eye care sincespecial assistance is available for the indigent.\57\<NOTE/> However, no evidence was presented by these commenters toindicate how extensive such programs are or under what circumstances theywould apply. Moreover, these commenters did not address the point thatconsumers not eligible for such assistance programs may be delaying orrationing purchases because of higher prices. On the other hand, we findpersuasive the testimony of consumer groups that all but the poorest consumersmust pay for vision care out of their own pocket without reimbursementby public assistance or private insurance.\58\<NOTE/> A study by the Optical Manufacturers Association demonstratedthat only 10-20 percent of all expenditures for eye examinations, eyeglasses,and contact lenses is paid for by insurers or other third-party payors.The remaining 80-90 percent is paid directly by the patient.\59\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ See, e.g., Nathan Study, J-66(a), Vol. I, Ex. 1 at 109-110;J.

The recordindicates that commercial optometrists may be more conveniently located\60\<NOTE/> and may be more frequently available on weekends and evenings.\61\<NOTE/> These are additional reasons why restrictions on such firmstend to reduce accessibility and the frequency of purchase of vision care.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ See NAOO, H-78, at 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ Id. at 3; NAOO Panel, Tr. 383-84.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Countervailing Benefits of Commercial Practice Restrictions</ITAG>The stated justification for commercial practice restrictions is that theyare necessary to maintain high-quality vision care.\6\\2\<NOTE/> If this assertion were true, one would expect to find higherquality care in those markets where commercial practice is prohibited orlimited. But the record is quite clear on this central issue: There isno difference in the average quality of care available to consumers inrestrictive and nonrestrictive markets.\6\\3\<NOTE/> Our conclusion that commercial practice restrictions do notincrease the average quality of care provided \6\\4\<NOTE/> is based primarily on the results of the BE Study, and isalso supported by the Contact Lens Study and by the absence of any substantialand reliable contrary evidence.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ We note that the majority of states where commercialpractices exist did not testify in this proceeding.

Bothcommercial and noncommercial optometrists have similar educational qualificationsand must pass the same licensing examinations in order to practice. Commercialoptometrists face the same incentives as noncommercial optometrists tosatisfy consumer demand and provide an acceptable level of quality eyecare. Private optometrists, like commercial firms, must earn a profit inorder to stay in business and both types of practitioners seek to generateprofits by selling eyewear. Practitioners in both groups must maintaina good reputation in order to attract and hold the loyalty of patients.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 108-113 (discussionof BE Study) and 188-206 (discussion of other quality evidence).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\ In fact, as discussed <T3>supra</T3> at section II.B.2, the restrictions have some adverse effecton quality of care because the higher prices associated with restrictionscause consumers to seek eye care less frequently.The BE Study compared eye care quality in markets with and without chainfirms and found that the overall level of quality of eye care was not lowerin markets where chain firms were allowed to operate.\6\\5\<NOTE/> The study provides reliable evidence covering major areasof eye care provided by optometrists, including the accuracy of prescriptions,the accuracy and workmanship of eyeglasses, the extent of unnecessary prescribing,and the ability to detect eye problems and pathologies.\6\\6\<NOTE/> The study found that there was no significant differencein any of these aspects of quality between markets with chain firms andthose without chain firms.\6\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\5\ The BE Study is discussed in detail in the Final StaffReport, L-1, at 101-122.

Other factorssuch as the forces of supply and demand are most likely responsible forthis distribution. At most, the evidence suggests that there is a groupof optometrists in both types of markets that will meet the demand forlower-cost, less-extensive exams. Where commercial practice is restricted,noncommercial optometrists meet that demand, but charge higher prices thancommercial practitioners in nonrestrictive markets.

Appendix C of the Final Staff Report, L-1, containsa detailed description of, and expert comments on, the Nathan survey'smethodology. 1. <T3>The BE Study.</T3> The BE Study was designed to measure the effectson consumers of commercial practice restrictions. The study was conceivedand conducted by the Bureau of Economics with the expert advice of optometristson the faculties of two major colleges of optometry (the College of Optometryof the State University of New York and the Pennsylvania College of Optometry)and the Director of the Optometric Service of the Veterans Administration.In the study, nineteen trained survey researchers \78\<NOTE/> posed as consumers and purchased over 400 eye exams and over230 pairs of eyeglasses from optometrists in twelve different metropolitanareas across the country.\79\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ With two exceptions, the survey subjects had relativelyroutine visual problems. Some commenters and the Presiding Officer questionedthe study's validity because subjects with more complex problems and pathologieswere not included. See Post-record comment of AOA, M-176, at 5-7, 227-230,382-84; Post-record comment of COA, M-178, at 6, 9-14; and Presiding Officer'sReport, L-2, at 176-177. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ BE defined the relevant geographical markets as StandardMetropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA's). The 12 SMSA's were: Little Rock,Arkansas; Knoxville, Tennessee; Providence, Rhode Island; Columbia, SouthCarolina; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Columbus,Ohio; Portland, Oregon; Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota;Seattle, Washington; and Washington, DC. The twelve markets represented a range of competitive and regulatory environments.Cities were classified as markets where advertising was present if therewas advertising of eyeglasses or eye exams in the newspapers or ``YellowPages.'' Cities were classified as markets with commercial practice ifeye examinations were available from large optical chain firms.\80\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ The ``most restrictive'' markets in the study had neitheradvertising nor chain firms; in addition restrictive laws such as thoseat issue in this proceeding existed in these markets. Cities were classifiedas ``least restrictive'' if advertising and chain firms were present. Inthe least restrictive cities there was price advertising of eyeglassesand at least nonprice advertising of eye exams. Based on the data obtained by the survey subjects, the BE Study's authorscalculated the average prices charged for an eye exam and eyeglasses \81\<NOTE/> by each type of practitioner in each type of market (<T3>e.g.,</T3> chain firms in nonrestrictive markets, nonadvertisers innonrestrictive markets). Then, using data regarding the number of optometristsof each type in a particular market, the study's authors calculated market-wideaverage prices for markets with both advertising and chain firms and formarkets with neither.\82\<NOTE/> Subsequent to the study's publication, its principal authorcalculated market-wide average prices for markets with chain firms andmarkets without chain firms.\83\<NOTE/> These calculations showed that the average prices chargedby optometrists for eye exams and eyeglasses were 18% higher in marketswithout chain firms than in markets with chain firms.\84\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ This amount included any dispensing fees, as well ascharges for glaucoma tests or any other exam procedures that were pricedseparately. In order to minimize variations in the eyeglasses frames, subjectswere instructed to purchase a particular unisex metal frame, if possible.BE Study, B-2-31, at 46. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ BE Study, B-2-31, at 5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ Rebuttal Statement of R.

BE staff used multivariate regression analysis to analyze the data for:(1) Differences among markets in the advertising environment,\85\<NOTE/> (2) differences among markets in the supply of optometrists;(3) differences among markets in the demand for optometric services; and(4) differences among subjects in prescriptive needs. Each of these factorsmight affect price, independent of the presence of chain firms. The pricedata were also adjusted for differences in the cost-of-living among cities.\86\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ Some commenters noted that the BE Study did not discussthe independent effects of advertising and chain firms. See, e.g., NathanStudy, J-66(a) at 32, 38-39, 47; AOA, H-81, at 24. However, the BE Studydid report that neither advertising nor chain firms had any effect uponquality in a market. Also, while the BE Study did not discuss the independenteffects of chain firms and advertising upon price, the study was designedto examine these effects separately. R. Bond, FTC economist, Tr. 466; RebuttalStatement of R. Bond, K-18, at 5. The separate effects of chain firms werederived by performing a simple calculation on the BE Study's underlyingdata.

In order to measure any differences in quality between markets with chainfirms and markets without chain firms, the study compared: (1) The accuracyof the eyeglass prescriptions; (2) the accuracy and workmanship of theeyeglasses; (3) the extent of unnecessary prescribing; and (4) the abilityof the optometrist to detect eye problems and pathologies. Elaborate procedureswere established to guarantee an accurate and unbiased assessment of thesefactors.\87\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 108-112. On the first three dimensions of quality the study directly examined theoptometrist's product or service or ``output.'' For example, the optometristswho acted as consultants for the study performed eye examinations on eachsurvey subject before the subjects went into the field. After examinations,prescriptions, and eyeglasses were obtained by the subjects, the consultantscompared those prescriptions and eyeglasses to the prescriptions they hadwritten. The consultants also assessed the eyeglasses for the quality ofworkmanship_e.g., scratches and imperfections on lenses, the quality ofthe edging and mounting of lenses, and the quality of materials used. On the fourth aspect of quality, output was not directly examined. Thatis, the study did not directly examine whether or not optometrists detectedeye pathologies since the study did not use subjects with such pathologies.Instead, the study used a ``process'' test that indirectly measured thelikelihood that an optometrist would detect such pathologies by examiningwhether the optometrist performed the tests and procedures that are designedto detect complex eye problems and pathologies. This process test was highly sophisticated and did detect meaningful differencesin quality between optometrists. For example, the thoroughness index usedin the BE Study included over twenty test procedures as well as other aspectsof the examination.\88\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ Thus, we reject the assessment that the process testmeasured only a very simple and basic process. See Presiding Officer'sReport, L-2, at 175; Post-record comment of AOA, M-176, at 227-49; Post-recordcomment of COA, M-178, at 9, 13. See also discussion in Staff's Final Recommendations,O-1(b), at 34-35. The evidence establishes that the use of this process test provided reliableinformation about differences in quality of care for two reasons. First,there is a close correlation between the use of a correct process and acorrect outcome. During the rulemaking hearings, noncommercial optometristswere virtually unanimous in their assessment that more procedures and moretime spent during an eye examination is indicative of a higher qualityexam.\89\<NOTE/> In fact, some of the same optometrists who criticized theBE Study's use of a process test, nevertheless used the results of thattest to demonstrate the alleged differences in quality of care offeredby optometrists in nonrestrictive markets.\90\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ See, e.g., AOA Comment, H-81, at 42; B.

In otherwords, it would have to be shown that any differences in quality were dueto differences in competence rather than to differences in time spent andprocedures performed. The evidence shows, however, that any differencesin quality, if they exist, are likely due to time spent or procedures performedand not due to commercial optometrists performing given test proceduresless competently than other optometrists.\92\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/> \91\ Those commenters who alleged bias in the process testprovided no persuasive explanation for that assertion. See AOA Comment,H-81, at 27; Nathan Study, J-66(1), Vol. I, Ex. 1, at 79.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ The regression analysis that BE Staff performed on theNathan survey data indicates that there is no such bias. The analysis foundthat the commercial firms in the Nathan survey did not exhibit a statisticallysignificant lower pass rate than the private firms, holding constant thetime spent on an exam and whether or not a case history was taken. Thistends to show that commercial firms perform as well as noncommercial optometristswhen they both spend equal time and perform equivalent procedures. SeeFinal Staff Report, L-1, Appendix A at 5-6.The Presiding Officer rejected the quality results of the BE Study. Heapparently believed that only an outcome test, using subjects with a widerange of pathologies, would provide reliable evidence. We disagree withthis conclusion for two reasons. First, it ignores the BE data discussedabove, which permits conclusions about more complex eye problems, and itdoes not take into account the practical problems presented in conductinga methodologically sound outcome study. Individuals with pathologies inneed of immediate treatment could not ethically be used in a lengthy seriesof field examinations. Finding a large enough sample of individuals whowould be suitable survey subjects and who had pathologies not in need ofimmediate treatment would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive.Second, there is a significant likelihood that the pathological conditionswould change while the survey was being conducted, which would make itimpossible to make valid comparisons among the optometrists examining thesurvey subjects. These obstacles cast serious doubt on the feasibilityof conducting an outcome test on this aspect of quality.The Commission also considered and rejected the assertion that the BE Studywould have found that quality was lower in nonrestrictive markets thanrestrictive markets if its authors had calculated average quality basedon the total number of exams given, rather than on number of practitioners.Dr. Kenneth Myers, Director of Optometry Services at the Veterans Administrationand a former consultant to the FTC on the BE Study, asserted that the methodfor calculating average thoroughness of examinations on a market-wide basiswas flawed. The BE Study calculated averages by simply averaging the thoroughnessscores of all optometrists. Because some optometrists see more patientsthan others, Dr. Myers believed that the averages should have been weightedto account for the different number of exams performed by individual optometrists.He assumed that such a calculation would lead to a finding of lower averagequality in markets with chain firms than the finding reported in the BEStudy. However, if one uses Dr. Myers' methodology and his estimate thatthe typical commercial practitioner performs twice as many exams as thetypical noncommercial practitioner, average quality scores for both restrictiveand nonrestrictive markets would be lower, but the average score for nonrestrictivemarkets would still be about the same as that for restrictive markets.\93\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ See Staff's Final Recommendations, Addendum to AppendixA, O-1(b), at 8.We find that the process test used in the BE Study to evaluate comparativeexamination thoroughness provides meaningful information about qualityof care. Moreover, that test was only one of four factors used to evaluatequality of care. Our conclusions on the quality of care are based on therecord as a whole, and not just individual components of any one study.2. <T3>The Contact Lens Study. </T3>In this study, the eyes of over 500 cosmeticcontact lens wearers in 18 urban areas across the country were examinedfor the presence of seven potentially pathological eye conditions commonlyassociated with improper contact lens fitting.\94\<NOTE/> Each of the survey subjects had been fitted with contactlenses within the preceding three years and was still wearing contact lensesat the time the examinations were performed. The examination procedureswere chosen after consultations with representatives of the major eye careprofessional organizations_the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the AmericanOptometric Association, and the Opticians Association of America.\95\<NOTE/> Those organizations also nominated the expert examiners whoperformed the eye examinations. Three examiners_an ophthalmologist, anoptometrist, and an optician_examined each subject.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ These included epithelial and microcystic edema (intercellularaccumulation of fluids which causes the cornea to swell); corneal staining(abrasions or lesions on the cornea); corneal neovascularization (impingementof blood vessels into the normally avascular cornea); corneal striae (ridgesor furrows on the cornea); injection (``bloodshot'' eyes); and cornealdistortion or warpage (irregularity in the curvatures of the cornea). Thesubjects were also tested for visual acuity to determine whether theirprescriptions were adequate. Contact Lens Study, B-5-1, at 20-21. Also,subjects' lenses were examined to determine their physical condition andcleanliness.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ There is evidence on the record that representativesof all three organizations reached a consensus on the methodology to beused in the study. See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 124 n. 296.The examiners were instructed to determine which of the five illustrationsof each potentially pathological condition in a grading manual most closelyresembled the actual appearance of the subject's eyes. The grading manual,which had been designed by the group representatives, was used to minimizeinconsistencies in grading by the several dozen examiners. The examinerthen recorded a grade of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 for each condition. A grade of0 meant that the condition was absent; a grade of 4 signified that thecondition was present to an extreme degree. The number grades for eachof the seven conditions for each eye were combined using a weighing formulato create a ``summary quality score'' for each subject, which would indicatethe overall condition of the subject's eyes.\96\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ Since all of the seven conditions are not necessarilyequally serious, they were assigned different weights based on the relativeseverity of that condition.In addition to analyzing the summary quality scores, the study also examinedthe relative presence of each of the seven eye conditions individually.A ``higher quality'' score was assigned if the examination revealed thata particular condition was totally absent (i.e., the grade was 0); a ``lowerquality'' score was assigned if the examination revealed that a particularcondition was present to any degree (i.e., the grade was 1, 2, 3, or 4).In order to compare quality among the different providers, differencesin the summary and individual quality scores were computed for commercialoptometrists, noncommercial optometrists, opthalmologists, and opticians.Multiple regression estimation techniques were used in order to controlfor the effects of a number of factors other than fitter competence thatcould have affected the relative health of the study subjects' eyes. Theseadditional factors included the wearers' age, sex, and wearing habits,and the physical condition of the lenses.The survey subjects were also asked how much they paid for their lenses,the eye exam, follow-up care, and the initial lens care kit.\97\<NOTE/> The final package price figures were then adjusted for cost-of-livingdifferences in the 18 cities in the sample and to account for the factthat the subjects purchased their lenses in different years.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ Some commenters noted that the price data collected isbased on consumers' recall of the prices that they paid, at times, severalyears in the past. Nathan Study, J-66(a), Vol. 1, Exh. 2, at 14, 15, and27. No bias is alleged, however, and there appears to be no reason whyconsumers would systematically recall paying lower prices at commercialfirms than at noncommercial firms. Thus, even if there is some random errorin the price data for both commercial and noncommercial optometrists, itwould not affect the price differences which were found.Two additional tests were later conducted by BE staff on the Contact LensStudy data which demonstrated that these price differences were, in fact,associated with the presence of commercial practice and were not due tothe effects of advertising or other market forces that could also affectprices. These tests corroborated the general findings of the study thatcommercial optometrists charged less than noncommercial optometrists.\98\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ See J.

Some commenters stated that the study did not include a representativesample and distribution of difficult contact lens patients and fittingproblems and that no difficult cases were included. See, e.g., Post-recordcomment of AOA, M-176, at 298-300, 302; Post-record comment of COA, M-178,at 14. The fact that the study may not contain a representative distributionof difficult cases does not, however, invalidate the data which the studydoes provide. While some difficult cases were undoubtedly included in thestudy, the study did not include an assessment of the relative abilityof optometrists to fit more difficult lenses such as therapeutic lensesand the more recently available extended wear lenses, toric lenses, orbifocal lenses. See</ITAG> AOA Post-record comment, M-176, at 102. Also,by excluding patients who had previously worn or attempted to wear contactlenses within three years of the survey date, the study excluded many patientswith more difficult eye problems who may have experienced prior problemswith their lenses. See Contact Lens Study, B-5-1, at A-1. (Excluding thesepatients also significantly reduced the possibility of bias which coulddevelop if patients who knew they had difficult eye problems tended toselect one group of optometrists over another.) Staff determined that itwas impractical to include therapeutic lenses, and other more complex lensescould not be included because they were not available at the time the studywas conducted. See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 142-43. However, the failureto study these more difficult cases does not detract from the validityof the data which the study does provide on the relative ability of optometriststo fit the less-difficult cosmetic contact lens patient.In most instances, the failure to include the specified procedure was unavoidable.For example, consultants and staff wanted to evaluate the care given toformer contact lens wearers and to evaluate changes in the k-readings.However, in both instances, the expert consultants could suggest no practicaland meaningful way to do so.\103\<NOTE/> The testimony of some witnesses suggests that some transientand less significant eye problems might have been more frequently apparentif subjects had been required to wear their lenses for at least four hoursbefore they were examined.\104\<NOTE/> But other more serious and long-term conditions do not disappearovernight and would still have been apparent even if a subject had insertedhis or her lenses only an hour or two before being examined.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ See Staff's Final Recommendations, O-1(b), at 43-45.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ Id. at 47 n.166.The Presiding Officer and some commenters appear to have concluded thatthe study's findings must be entirely rejected because of these allegedmethodological shortcomings. Although the Contact Lens Study may fail toprovide information on some types of patients, or some types of contactlenses, there is no evidence on the record indicating that the study resultswould have been different had this additional data been included, or thatthe absence of that data created a bias in favor of commercial optometriststhat affected the overall results of the survey.The BE and Contact Lens Studies provide reliable information about therelative cost and quality of eye care available in the marketplace. Weconclude that the evidence provided by the studies_along with other evidenceon the record_meets or exceeds the applicable legal standards. In seekingevidence on the need for a rule, the Commission must balance the benefitsand costs of obtaining information that answers all questions with certainty.\105\<NOTE/> In this proceeding, the studies were subjected to intensescrutiny, but none of the studies' critics offered evidence that materiallydiscredited the studies' key findings.

Introduction</ITAG>A major issue in this proceeding is the extent of the FTC's authority todeclare state laws to be unfair acts or practices. After careful considerationof the legal issues discussed below, we have concluded that the FTC can,in appropriate instances, proceed directly against unfair state restraints.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Unfairness</ITAG>This rule declares certain state-imposed restrictions on commercial practiceby optometrists to be unfair acts or practices. The Commission has authorityunder section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to prescribe:<ITAG tagnum="21">[R]ules which define with specificity acts or practices which areunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce [withinthe meaning of * * * section 5(a)(1)].\1\\0\\6\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\6\15 U.S.C. 57(a)(1)(B).When Congress created the FTC in 1914 it gave the Commission power to determineand prevent ``unfair methods of competition.'' From the beginning Congressintended this power to be interpreted very broadly.\1\\0\\7\<NOTE/> Congress necessarily recognized that it would be impossibleto define or even to predict the infinite ways in which the goals of thestatute might be thwarted. Consequently, Congress gave the Commission thetools to deal with problems as they developed. Although the original languagefocused on competition, it was generally understood that the Act ``gavethe Commission considerable discretion in identifying unfair consumer practices.''108<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>107Realizing that it would be impossible to define with specificityall unfair practices, Congress considered and chose not to enact a statutorydefinition of the term ``unfair method of competition.'' See S. Rep. No.596, 63d Cong. 2d Sess. 13 (1914) and H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1142, 63d Cong.,2d Sess. 19 (1940), <T3>cited in American Financial Services</T3> v. <T3>FTC,</T3> 767 F.2d 957 (1985). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>108See Averitt, <T3>The Meaning of ``Unfair Acts or Practices'' in section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act,</T3> 70 Geo L.J. 225, 230-231, 235.The Wheeler-Lea amendments of 1938109<NOTE/> clarified the FTC's authority to reach acts and practicesthat injure the public as well as competitors. Those amendments added languageto section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit not only ``unfair methods of competition,''but also ``unfair or deceptive acts or practices.''110<NOTE/> In passing that amendment Congress contemplated that theconcept of unfairness would be a flexible doctrine, responsive to changingconditions in the marketplace. The courts have repeatedly recognized thebreadth of this delegation and have given the Commission significant latitudein defining unfairness.111<NOTE/> In its 1980 Unfairness Statement112<NOTE/> the Commission set out the principles that currently guidethe Commission in determining whether acts or practices are unfair.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>10952 Stat. 111 (1938) (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>110Id. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>111See, e.g., <T3>Atlantic Refining Co. v. </T3><T3>FTC,</T3> 381 U.S. 357, 367 (1965); <T3>FTC v. </T3><T3>R.F.

Those principles were accepted by the D.C. Circuit in upholding the CreditPractices Rule.113<NOTE/> The court's opinion noted that the consumer injury test describedin the Commission's Unfairness Statement was ``the most precise definitionof unfairness articulated by either the Commission or Congress.''114<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>113<T3>American Financial Services v. FTC,</T3> 767 F.2d 957 (D.C.

Id. at 982. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>114Id. at 972. The court noted further that Congress had reviewedthe Statement and ``ha[d] not seen fit to enact any more particularizeddefinition of unfairness to limit the Commission's discretion.'' Id. at982.The Unfairness Statement sets out three criteria that must be met in orderto find consumer injury: (1) The injury must be substantial; (2) the injurymust not be outweighed by offsetting consumer or competitive benefits;and (3) the injury must be one that consumers cannot reasonably avoid.115<NOTE/> The rulemaking record demonstrates that the injury flowingfrom state restrictions on the commercial practice of optometry clearlymeet these criteria.116<NOTE/> As summarized <T3>supra</T3> in sections II. B. and C., these restrictions injure consumersby substantially raising the price of eye care, by limiting its accessibility,and by reducing the frequency with which consumers receive it. Further,no demonstrable benefits have been shown to flow from these restrictions,nor can consumers reasonably escape their injurious effect.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>115Unfairness Statement, supra note 28 at 5-6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>116See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 306-26. Like other rules promulgated under the Commission's unfairness authority,this rule seeks to halt practices that unreasonably create or take advantageof an obstacle to the free exercise of consumer decisionmaking and, inturn, to a well-functioning market.117<NOTE/> Here, however, the obstacles are created by state governmentsrather than by private actors. This compels us to consider whether theactions of state governments can be unfair acts or practices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>117Unfairness Statement, supra note 28, at 7-8. <T3>See also American Fianncial Services, Inc. v. FTC,</T3> 767 F.2d 957,98, (DC Cir. 1985). Through the Magnuson-Moss amendments of 1975 Congress sought to bolsterthe Commission's existing authority to find acts or practices to be unfair.118<NOTE/> During consideration of the rulemaking provisions, Congressrepeatedly acknowledged that Commission rules would preempt inconsistentstate law.119<NOTE/> The legislative history of Magnuson-Moss reveals that boththe sponsors and opponents of the bill recognized the potentially broadreach of the proposed rulemaking authority and contemplated that this powercould be used to challenge existing laws directly.120<NOTE/> A conclusion that harmful state restrictions could not bedeemed ``unfair'' would be inconsistent with this Congressional understanding.Since the passage of the Magnuson-Moss amendments, Congress' attentionhas been drawn repeatedly to Commission rulemakings that would reach statelaws. Each time the issue has arisen during debates over amendments tothe FTC Act, Congress has declined to limit the reach of our unfairnessauthority under section 18. In fact, in 1985 both the House and Senateexpressly stated their understanding that the Commission's unfairness authorityextends to prohibiting state restraints through rules such as the proposedEveglasses II rule.121<NOTE/> Against this legislative background, we believe that theCommission's unfairness authority is broad enough to encompass state laws.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>118Magnuson-Moss Warranty_Federal Trade Commission ImprovementAct, 88 Stat. 2183 (1975) (15 U.S.C. 57(a)). The amendments extended theFTC's unfairness jurisdiction by adding the ``affecting'' commerce languageto section 5 of the FTCA and by granting rulemaking power through section18. <ITAG tagnum="28">Some commenters argued that nothing in the Wheeler-Lea amendmentsauthorized the Commission to find state laws to be unfair, and nothingin the Magnuson-Moss Act broadened the preexisting definition of unfairness.</ITAG><T3>See</T3> Post-record comment of AOA, M-176, at 25-27 and Post-recordcomment of COA, M-178, at 22-29. We read the legislative history of Wheeler-Leaas confirmation of the principle that the unfairness standard must be abroad one. That interpretation is then brought to the legislative historyof Magnuson-Moss where Congress did express its understanding that Section18 rules would preempt state laws.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>119See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 330-37. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>120117 Cong.

Preemption</ITAG>Although the language of the FTC Act does not expressly address the preemptiveeffect of Commission rules, it is clear that Section 18 trade regulationrules preempt inconsistent state law. Under the Supremacy Clause of theU.S. Constitution (Art. VI, section 2), federal law supersedes inconsistentstate law. Validly enacted regulations of federal agencies have the samepreemptive effect on inconsistent state laws as federal statutes, evenin the absence of any explicit Congressional statement of intent to preempt.\1\\2\\2\<NOTE/> Where there is irreconcilable conflict between federal andstate regulation and no express langauge about preemption, either in theenabling statute or in the legislative history, the customary Presumptionis in favor of preemption.\1\\2\\3\<NOTE/> Here that presumption is bolstered by the legislative historyof the Magnuson-Moss Act and by subsequent court interpretations of Commissionrulemaking power. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>122 See, e.g., Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Ass'n v.De La Questa, 458 U.S. 141, 153-54 (1982). See also discussion in FinalStaff Report, L-1, at 327-28. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>123 See, e.g., <T3>Paul v. United States, </T3>371 U.S. 245 (1963); <T3>Free v. Bland, </T3>369 U.S. 663 (1962).Those commenters who have insisted that the Commission cannot preempt statelaws absent a clear indication of Congressional intent have misunderstoodthe nature of the rulemaking authority delegated to the Commission by Congressin the Magnuson-Moss Act.\1\\2\\4\<NOTE/> A showing of express Congressional intention to preempt isnecessary only where Congress directs an agency to ``occupy a field'' ofregulation.\1\\2\\5\<NOTE/> In enacting the FTC Act and Title II of the Magnuson-MossAct Congress did not intend that the Commission ``occupy the field'' ofConsumer protection\1\\2\\6\<NOTE/> or antitrust regulation. In fact, in proposed legislationpreceding passage of the Magnuson-Moss amendments, Congress sought to clarifythe preemptive effect of Commission rules promulgated under Magnuson Mossby stating that the FTC Act would not occupy the field and that only inconsistentstate laws would be preempted.\1\\2\\7\<NOTE/> Throughout the period when rulemaking legislation was beingconsidered, the record shows that Congress was aware of the preemptionissue, invariably assumed that Commission rules would preempt inconsistentstate law, and took no action to limit that preemptive effect.\1\\2\\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>124 For example, both the AOA and the COA claimed that neitherthe language nor the legislative history of Magnuson-Moss show a clearmanifestation of Congressional intent to grant FTC rules preemptive power.See Post-record comment of AOA, M-176, at 10-25 and Post-record commentof COA, M-178, at 22-28. They go on to note that Title I of Magnuson-Moss(i.e., warranty provisions) contains an express grant of preemptive powerwhile Title II (i.e., section 18 rulemaking) contains no such express grant.However, in Title I Congress intended to occupy a portion of the fieldof warranty regulation and therefore needed to express the preemptive effect.Title II envisions only conflict preemption. The case law cited by thesecommenters unequivocally establishes that conflict preemption flows automaticallyfrom the Supremacy Clause, regardless of any express Congressional intentto preempt. See, e.g., <T3>Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Ass'n v. De La Questa, </T3>458 U.S.141, 153-54 (1982); <T3>Michigan Canners and Freezers Ass'n v.

However, similar measures had been introduced in the two previousCongresses. Language regarding preemption appeared in some, but not all,of the proposed bills and accompanying reports.

The Court in <T3>Katharine Gibbs School v. FTC, </T3>612 F.2d 658 (2d Cir. 1979), reliedon similar reasoning on treating the preemption issue as settled. Althoughthe Court remaded the rule in that case because the Commission had notdefined with specificity the unfair acts and practices targeted by therule, the court indicated that ``questions of preemption could be answeredwith relatively little difficulty,'' if the Commission identified clearlythe acts and practices encompassed by a rule. 612 F. 2d at 66.

FTC</T3>, 773 F.2d391 (1st Cir. 1985); <T3>Indiana Federation of Dentists</T3>, 101 F.T.C. 57, 180 n. 24 (1983).In 1987, both the House and Senate passed versions of FTC authorizing legislationthat would codify the Commission's application of the state action doctrineto its unfair methods of competition jurisdiction. In drafting this legislation,however, it is clear that Congress intended that the Commission's authorityover unfair acts or practices not be limited by the state action doctrine.H.R. Rep. 271, 100th Cong. 1st Sess., 20 (1987).Important differences between the Sherman and FTC Acts demonstrate thatthe policy reasons that led the Court to limit the reach of the ShermanAct do not apply to our rulemaking authority under section 18 of the FTCAct. In construing the Sherman Act, the Court recognized that, if the Actwere to be applied to certain state actions, widespread and indiscriminatedisruption of long-standing state economic legislation would occur. Well-establishedstate economic regulation could be dismantled at the behest of privatelitigants with no consideration given to important state interests. Implicitin the Court's holding was the realization that if the Sherman Act wereto apply to state action, private parties and state officials would besubject retroactively to treble damages and criminal sanctions for obeyingotherwise valid state laws.\1\\3\\4\<NOTE/> Given Congressional silence on the effect of the ShermanAct on state law, the <T3>Parker</T3> court concluded that Congress could not have intended suchsweeping and possibly chaotic results.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\4\ <T3>See</T3> Verkuil, <T3>Preemption of State Law by the Federal Trade Commission</T3>, 1976Duke L.J. 225, 231; Note, <T3>The State Action Exemption and Antitrust Enforcement Under the FederalTrade Commission Act</T3>, 89 Harv. Law Rev. 715, 734-736 (1976).Application of section 18 rulemaking to state legislation would not producesuch dire consequences. First, challenges to state laws under section 18can be initiated only by the FTC, a federal agency with a mandate to protectthe public interest and subject to Congressional oversight. In contrast,private parties seeking to protect private rights or enrich private pocketsmay use the Sherman Act to challenge state laws. Second, FTC rules applyprospectively, eliminating the danger of imposing retrospective penalties,such as those available under the Sherman Act,\1\\3\\5\<NOTE/> against state officials or against private parties who haveacted in good faith reliance on otherwise valid state laws.\1\\3\\6\<NOTE/> Third, rulemaking is a more appropriate vehicle for examiningwhether federal or state interests are served by regulatory schemes thanadjudicative actions under the Sherman Act. Unlike a private action broughtunder the Sherman Act, rulemaking allows for participation by all interestedparties (including state officials) and for development of a record thatreflects a broader perspective than could be achieved in private litigation.Because it more closely resembles the legislative than the adjudicativemodel, rulemaking is more conducive to the formation of public consensusand compromise. Finally, the application of the unfairness criteria ina section 18 rulemaking requires the Commission to consider the prevalenceof the acts or practices, the nature of the injury, and any countervailingbenefits. Thus, a section 18 rulemaking permits a review of state law thatis both more flexible and potentially more protective of important stateinterests \1\\3\\7\<NOTE/> than is an action under the Sherman Act, where the focusis exclusively on competition issues. Thus, any disruption of long-standingstate economic legislation will not occur unless careful review of theevidence shows that minimal or no benefits flow from that legislation.\1\\3\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\5\ The retrospective penalties provided for under theSherman Act are treble damages and criminal sanctions. Courts have consideredthe nature of the remedy and whether the suit is brought by a private litigantor by the federal government to be relevant factors in determining whetherCongress intended particular statutory provisions to apply to the states.See <T3>Employees of the Department v. Department of Public Health and Welfare</T3>,411 U.S. 279 (1973). <T3>Cf. Lafayette v. Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co.</T3>, 435 U.S. 389(1977); <T3>New Mexico v.

The onlyquestion in that case was whether the various redress provisions of thestatute were intended by Congress to apply to state governments. The Courtconcluded that Congress did not intend to allow private parties to seekpenalties from state governments although Congress did intend to allowthe federal government to sue state governments for violations of thisact. In reaching this conclusion the court was influenced by the fact thatthe penalty provisions ``may saddle the states with `enormous fiscal burdens,'and that `Congress, acting responsibly, would not be presumed to take suchaction silently.'

Cir. 1980).IV.Federalism ConcernsAs discussed above in section III., we are persuaded that the Commissionhas the legal authority to prohibit the state restraints at issue in thisproceeding. Judicious exercise of that power, however, prompts us to considerwhether we should act in this instance. We are keenly aware that this proceedingraises important questions about the proper allocation of power betweenthe states and the federal government. However, after careful consideration,we are convinced that this rule is a proper exercise of federal power andis consonant with the principles of federalism.Because we are dealing with state law, we have proceeded with extreme cautionat each step of this rulemaking. Procedural safeguards are built into section18 rulemakings to ensure that all interested parties have ample noticeso that they have an opportunity both to present their views and evidenceand to challenge the evidence and views submitted by other parties.\1\\5\\0\<NOTE/> In deference to the significant state interests at stake,we solicited the views of state officials as well as industry members andconsumers. We gave every consideration to claims that quality of care concernsjustify these restrictions and would have deferred to any credible showingof countervailing benefits. In fact, when state laws are the subject ofa section 18 rulemaking, the Commission has required that there be an evenmore rigorous showing of consumer injury and absence of countervailingbenefits than is required under the Commission's unfairness standard.\1\\5\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\0\ The Magnuson-Moss amendments impose additional safeguardsbeyond those mandated by the Administrative Procedure Act. These includeadditional hearing requirements and expanded scope of review by the courts.15 U.S.C. 57a.

Our decision to forego remedies normallyavailable for violations of the FTC Act is a further indication of ourrecognition that the actions of states and their officials, as opposedto actions by private citizens, merit special consideration in an unfairnessproceeding. <T3>See</T3> discussion of Commission's enforcement policy <T3>infra</T3> in section V.Nonetheless, as discussed above in section II.C., the record contains nopersuasive evidence that commercial practice restrictions have any positiveeffect on the quality of care consumers receive or that they promote anyother legitimate state interest. On the other hand, the record shows thatstate-imposed restraints on the commercial practice of optometry seriouslyhinder the provision of eye care to consumers. These restraints imposesubstantial costs on consumers. The primary effect of this regulation isto protect one category of providers, primarily solo practitioners, fromcompetition from high-volume chain firms_at an annual cost to consumersof millions of dollars. This stifling of competition not only leads tohigher prices and less eye care for consumers today, but delays the developmentof more innovative and cost-effective ways of providing services tomorrow.\1\\5\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\2\ For over thirty years scholars have written at lengthof the various ways in which excessive state economic regulation_such asthese restrictions on the commercial practice of optometry_distorts theoperation of markets and harm consumers. See, e.g., P. Verkuil, <T3>State Action, Due Process and Antitrust: Reflections on Parker v. Brown</T3>,75 Col. Law Rev. 328 (1975); G. Stigler, <T3>The Theory of Economic Regulation</T3>, 2 Bell J. Econ. andamp; Mgmt.Sc. 3 (1971); W. Gellhorn, <T3>Individual Freedom and Governmental Restraints</T3> (1956).While we are convinced of the injury that these restrictions cause, weare also mindful of the states' traditional role in protecting the healthand welfare of their citizens. Therefore, we have drafted this rule narrowlyso as not to intrude gratuitously on the legitimate exercise of the policepowers of the state.\1\\5\\3\<NOTE/> The extent of our ``intrusion'' is carefully limited to thoseregulations that have been shown to be unfair, and should not interferewith the states' ability to protect their citizens from deceptive or abusivepractices by optometrists or to ensure that high-quality optometric careis provided.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\3\ In response to the cautionary message of the Courtof Appeals in the Eyeglasses Rule, we have drafted this rule to focus narrowlyon four specific areas of commercial practice. In remanding the advertisingportions of the rule, the Court stated that the Commission had preemptedthe whole field of ophthalmic advertising, and so had ``at least approachedthe outer boundaries of its authority.'' 626 F.2d 896, 910. The Court wenton to state that answers to questions regarding preemption and state action``may depend . . . on the extent to which a federal regulation gratuitouslyintrudes on the exercise of police powers of the states.'' Id.What the rule does challenge is state regulation that, in effect, insulateslocal optometrists from competition from large, price-competitive chainfirms, most of which operate interstate.\1\\5\\4\<NOTE/> Thus, this rule intrudes on no traditional state interest.Rather, it represents an appropriate exercise of the Commission's responsibility,grounded in the Commerce Clause, to protect markets from unfair or deceptiveacts or practices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\4\ While on their face these restrictions do not discriminateagainst out-of-state providers, they, in fact, have a disproportionatelyharmful effect on high-volume practices that operate interstate.By empowering the federal government to regulate commerce, the framersclearly sought to limit the extent to which states could restrict the developmentof interstate markets. Such limits were originally seen as necessary toprotect the nascent national economy from the protectionist actions ofthe states, which the framers feared would lead to a destructive cycleof discrimination against out-of-state goods and the retaliation that wouldinevitably result.\1\\5\\5\<NOTE/> That some policy of limiting state authority over interstatemarkets, underlying the Commerce Clause, favors Commission action hereto prevent states from denying interstate ophthalmic providers access tolocal markets when the evidence demonstrates that the states' assertedbasis for such actions_to protect citizens from poor-quality ophthalmiccare_has no substantial basis in fact.\1\\5\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\5\ Under the Articles of Confederation, some statesengaged in protectionist activities that threatened to affect the developmentof a vital interstate economy. For example, New York imposed port feesand tonnage duties on vessels from Connecticut and New Jersey, increasingthe cost of farm products coming from those two states. In retaliation,New Jersey taxed the property for the lighthouse at Sandy Hook that NewYork had built, while Connecticut merchants suspended commercial dealingswith New York for one year and imposed fines on those who disregarded theboycott.

Nettels, <T3>The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815,</T3> 72-73 (1977).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\6\ We take no position on whether the commercial practicerestraints that are the subject of this rulemaking could be challengedsuccessfully by private parties using a Commerce Clause theory and theevidence on this record.In providing the Commission with Section 18 rulemaking authority, Congresshas made a limited delegation to the FTC of its legislative authority toprotect consumers from acts or practices that unreasonably interfere withthe efficient functioning of interstate markets. We find that the existingrestrictions on commercial practice are designed to and do impede the efficientflow of interstate commerce, and that they impose significant costs onconsumers without providing any countervailing benefits. Thus, they constitutethe kind of unfair acts or practices that Congress authorized the FTC tochallenge in section 18 rulemaking.We also believe that promulgation of this rule is consistent with a recentExecutive Order on federalism.\1\\5\\7\<NOTE/> That Order sets out certain policymaking criteria to guideexecutive agencies in the formulation of federal policy. In particular,the Order directs executive departments and agencies to act in strict adherenceto constitutional principles and limit the policymaking discretion of statesonly where there is clear and certain constitutional authority and onlywhere there is a problem not merely common to the states, but nationalin scope. In addition, the Order directs that any regulatory preemptionof state law be limited to the minimum level necessary to achieve the objectivesof the statute.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\7\ Exec. Order No. 12,612, 52 FR 41685 (1987).While the FTC is not bound by the requirements of this Order, we believethis rule conforms to the policymaking criteria outlined in the Order.We have proceeded under the clear and enumerated power of Congress to protectinterstate commerce. The legislative history of the Magnuson-Moss amendmentsand subsequent Congressional action provide clear authority for this rule.We have identified a serious problem amenable to solution only at the nationallevel; we have carefully examined the proffered claims of state interest;and we have fashioned a narrowly drawn deregulatory response that doesnot intrude on the legitimate interests states have in protecting the healthand safety of their citizens.V. Section-by-Section AnalysisThe following section-by-section analysis explains the intended scope andmeaning of each of the rule provisions adopted by the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 456.1: Definitions</ITAG>This section defines certain terms used in the rule. Many of these termsare contained in the Eyeglasses Rule and relate to the prescription releaserequirement. The rule makes some modifications to terms used in the EyeglassesRule and includes some new definitions.<T3>Paragraph (a):</T3> The term ``patient'' has been substituted for theterm ``buyer'' to conform more closely to industry usage. The term coversanyone who has undergone an eye examination.<T3>Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) </T3>remain unchanged from the originalrule definitions.<T3>Paragraphs (e) and (f) </T3>replace andSection; 456.1(h) of the EyeglassesRule. The specific terms ``ophthalmologist'' and ``optometrist'' in paragraphs(e) and (f) have been substituted for the general word ``refractionist''used in andSection; 456.1(h) of the Eyeglasses Rule to define those categoriesof providers_Doctors of Medicine, Osteopathy and Optometry_who are qualifiedunder state law to perform eye examinations. This change was made for tworeasons. First, the use of the term ``refractionist'' in the EyeglassesRule has caused confusion because it is not generally used by consumersor by industry members. Second, the provisions of the Eyeglasses II Rulerelating to commercial practice apply to optometrists, not ophthalmologists.The term ``refractionist'' has been deleted so that this distinction isclear.<T3>Paragraph (g):</T3> The definition of the term ``person'' has beenchanged. This term was originally used in andSection; 456.6 of the EyeglassesRule. That rule provision is no longer in effect, so the original definitionof the term is no longer relevant. The term ``person'' is now used onlyin the rule provisions concerning commercial practice. The definition hasbeen changed to make it clear that the term covers any individual, partnership,corporation or other entity, whether or not the FTC has jurisdiction overthe ``person.''<T3>Paragraph (h):</T3> The term ``prescription'' is defined as those specificationsnecessary to obtain lenses for eyeglasses. Thus, under the rule, the prescriptionthat is released to the patient need only contain the data on the refractivestatus of the patient's eyes and any information, such as the date or signatureof the examining optometrist or ophthalmologist, that state law requiresin a legally fillable eyeglass prescription. The definition deletes allreferences to contact lenses. This change is intended to end the confusiongenerated by the definition in the Eyeglasses Rule concerning the obligationof optometrists and ophthalmologists to place the phrase ``OK for contactlenses'' (or similar words) on eyeglass prescriptions. No such obligationexists under the rule. This change will also clarify the fact that theprescription release requirement does not affect state laws regulatingwho is legally permitted to fit contact lenses. This change does not affectthe requirement that optometrists and ophthalmologists offer prescriptionsfor lenses for eyeglasses to all patients whose eyes they examine, includingthose patients who wear or intend to purchase contact lenses.<T3>Paragraph (i): </T3>The definition of ``optometric services'' is new.It is intended to cover the full range of services which may be providedby an optometrist under state law. The precise meaning of the term mayvary slightly from state to state since states define the practice of optometrydifferently. The term only includes services provided by an optometrist,not by other professionals such as ophthalmologists who may also be licensedunder state law to provide such services.The new term is needed because the terms in the rule as originally proposeddid not cover the full range of services which may be provided by optometrists.The term ``ophthalmic services,'' as defined in andSection; 456.1(d), coversonly the measuring and fitting of eyeglasses or contact lenses subsequentto the eye exam. The term ``eye examination,'' as defined in andSection;456.1(b), covers tests and procedures to determine the refractive statusof the eyes. Optometrists are licensed to perform other services, however.For example, optometrists may prescribe eye exercises to deal with eyemuscle problems or, in many states, prescribe topically applied prescriptiondrugs to treat certain forms of eye disease. All such activities are includedunder the term ``optometric services.''<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 456.2: Separation of Examination and Dispensing</ITAG>This section requires that optometrists and ophthalmologists give prescriptionsfor eyeglass lenses to their patients immediately after completing an eyeexamination. Except for minor changes in terminology, this section is identicalto the prescription release requirement contained in the Eyeglasses Rule(originally andSection; 456.7).<T3>Paragraph (d) </T3>addresses the use of waivers or disclaimers of liability.As the Commission makes clear in its declaration of intent (andSection; 456.5(c)),the rule does not impose liability on an ophthalmologist or optometristfor the ophthalmic goods and services dispensed by another individual pursuantto the ophthalmologist's or optometrist's prescription. By its terms, therule proscribes only ``waivers or disclaimers'' of the physician's or optometrist'sown responsibility. The Commission has interpreted this portion of therule to permit nondeceptive affirmative statements concerning responsibility.For example, a written statement that ``the person who dispenses your eyeglassesis responsible for their accuracy'' would not violate andSection; 456.2(d).However, such an affirmative statement cannot be coupled with a waiveror disclaimer of the optometrist's or ophthalmologists's own liability.\1\\5\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\8\ 43 FR 46296-46297 (1978).<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 456.3: Federal or State Employees</ITAG>This section (originally andSection; 456.8 of Eyeglasses Rule) deletes referencesto the remanded portions of the Eyeglasses Rule and clarifies the intendedeffect of this section. This section exempts practitioners who work forany federal, state, or local government agency from the rule's prescriptionrelease requirements. If practitioners work only part-time for the government,the exemption only applies when they are engaged in their governmentalduties.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 456.4: State Bans on Commercial Practice \1\\5\\9\</ITAG><T3>Paragraph</T3><NOTE/> (a)(1): Lay Association. The purpose of this section is toinvalidate state prohibitions on optometrists' entering into certain designatedbusiness associations with nonoptometrists that make it possible to provideoptometric services and ophthalmic goods and services to consumers in moreefficient ways.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\9\ State bans may arise from a variety of sources:statutes, regulations, attorney general opinions, court opinions, and enforcementpolicy decisions by state boards and other state agencies. Regardless ofthe method used or the state entity involved, the rule prohibits such bans.As originally proposed, andSection; 456.4(a)(1) proscribed state prohibitionson ``employer-employee or other business relationships'' between optometristsand nonoptometrists. However, we realized that this language would leavesome uncertainty in the minds of lawmakers and practitioners as to thescope of the rule.\160\<NOTE/> We have narrowed the language of andSection; 456.4(a)(1) tomake it an unfair act or practice for states to prohibit those specifictypes of associations that the record demonstrates are critical to thedevelopment of commercial practice: (1) The employment of optometristsby lay persons or corporations to provide optometric services; (2) partnershipagreements, joint-ownership or equity-participation agreements, profit-sharingagreements, or franchise agreements \161\<NOTE/> between optometrists and nonoptometrists (including thosethat involve the sharing of revenues between optometrists and nonoptometrists)for the purpose of providing optometric services or ophthalmic goods orservices; or (3) the leasing of office space by optometrists from nonoptometrists,including the payment of rentals on such leases based on a percentage ofthe optometrist's revenues.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\160\ For example, some commenters argued that the originallanguage was broad enough to encompass regulations banning ``capping andsteering'' and referral arrangements. While in some instances such regulationsmay be unconstitutional restraints on commercial speech, the rule languagemakes clear that the rule does not cover such prohibitions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\161\ Typically, under an optometric franchising arrangement,the optometrist pays the franchiser for a specified set of goods or services,which might include the use of the franchiser's trade name and trademarks,the benefits of its goodwill, proven method of doing business, volume discountson equipment and inventory, financing available through the franchiser,and participation in the franchiser's advertising program. The franchiserretains control over many aspects of the franchisee's business organization,such as office design, items stocked, and minimum quality standards. J.Solish, Attorney, R.H. Teagle Corp., Tr. 1368-72; cf. P. Zeidman, Attorney,National Franchise Association, Tr. 591 (describing attributes of franchisingagreements generally).The record also demonstrates that lay control over the business aspectsof an optometric practice is an integral element of commercial practice.Subsection (v) invalidates those state regulations that prevent lay personsor corporations from controlling those business aspects of a practice thatthe record demonstrates have no effect on quality of care_e.g., settingof fees, salaries, or minimum office hours; location of the practice; choiceof suppliers of material, equipment, services, and laboratory work; establishingminimum quantities of materials in stock and minimum equipment;\1\\6\\2\<NOTE/> advertising, promotion, and marketing practices; accountingand financial practices; office design, decor, and maintenance; and otheractivities that involve business judgments to a similar degree.\1\\6\\3\<NOTE/> As discussed more completely herein, this provision of therule does not prevent states from passing regulations concerning thesebusiness aspects of optometry. It simply prevents the states from mandatingthat optometrists alone, and not lay persons or corporations, must makethese decisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\2\ Obviously, these minimum standards would have toaccord with any state-imposed standards for optometric practice. Furthermore,under the rule, states could require that optometrists be permitted tohave equipment and inventory above the minimum level established by thelay person or corporation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\3\ The record establishes that corporations which associatewith optometrists_for example, by employing optometrists or entering intofranchise agreements_where currently permitted, commonly control theseaspects of the business. See, e.g., NAOO, H-78a, at 39-40 and AppendicesJ, K, L, and M. Other evidence on the record, see supra section II.C.,demonstrates that associations between optometrists and lay persons haveno adverse impact on the quality of care available in the market.Finally, the language of this provision makes clear that the only affiliationscovered by andSection; 456.4(a)(1) are affiliations for the purpose of ``providingoptometric services'' or ``forming entities whose business, in whole orpart, is providing optometric services or ophthalmic goods and servicesto the public.'' The inclusion of this language makes clear that affiliationsfor anything other than this stated purpose are not covered by the rule.\164\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\4\ For example, the rule was never intended to addresscommercial practices by ophthalmologists. The record evidence centers oncommercial optometric practice; there is little evidence concerning commercialpractice by opthalmologists. Under this provision, ophthalmologists alsomay enter into affiliations with optometrists for the purpose of providingoptometric services or ophthalmic goods and services to the public.<ITAG tagnum="28">The term ``sellers'' also appeared in the proposed language of andSection;456.4(a)(1). Sellers was defined to include opticians. As a result, therule as originally proposed would have prohibited state restraints on laypersons employing (or otherwise affiliating with) ``sellers.'' The recordshows that the law of only one state prohibits such affiliations, and noevidence or comments were submitted about this restriction. Consequentlywe decline to extend the rule to such a restriction.</ITAG>The rule does not interfere with a state's ability to adopt or enforceany law or regulation that addresses specific harmful practices arisingfrom lay association. For example, the rule does not interfere with a state'sability to prohibit improper lay control of the practice of optometry orthe professional judgment of an optometrist, where the terms ``practiceof optometry'' or ``professional judgment'' do not encompass those businessaspects of a practice described in subsection (v). The rule does not affect the ability of the states to prohibit the useof certain compensation schemes. For example, states could, if they wereso inclined, prohibit employers of optometrists from setting quotas forthe number of examinations that optometrists must perform. States couldalso choose to ban the payment of commission based on the number of examinationsgiven or prescriptions written by optometrists. The evidence in this recorddoes not establish that commission payments provide clear consumer benefitsor that they result in no consumer injury.\1\\6\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\5\ In contrast to sa franchise or leasing arrangement,for example, where an optometrist pays a percentage of his gross revenueto the franchiser or lessor, commission payments entail a payment to anoptometrist which varies depending upon the number of eyeglasses sold orrevenue generated by the optometrist. The former creates no incentive forthe optometrist to overprescribe while the latter arguably does.States may also establish minimum standards of competence or honesty anddiscipline those optometrists, commercial or not, who fail to meet thosestandards. In short, under the rule, states retain broad authority to regulatethe commercial and traditional practice of optometry in order to protectthe health and safety of their citizens and to prevent abuse of consumers.<T3>Paragraph (a)(2): Branch Offices. </T3>The rule allows optometriststo own, operate, or practice in any number of offices. Corporations orother entities which offer optometric services through affiliations betweenoptometrists and lay persons, as allowed by andSection; 456.4(a)(1) of therule, would also be permitted to own or operate any number of offices.The rule also prohibits states from requiring optometrists to remain inpersonal attendance at each branch office for a specific percentage ofthe time the branch is open. Such a requirement effectively limits thenumber of branch offices that an optometrist may own and therefore is prohibitedby the rule.However, as andSection; 456.5(a) makes clear, the states retain broad authorityto regulate health and safety and to prevent consumer abuses. For example,states could require that optometric services or ophthalmic goods or servicesprovided at each office be supplied only by a person qualified to do so.As another example, states could regulate the services provided at eachoffice by requiring minimum eye examination procedures, minimum officeequipment, or a specific level of sanitation. <T3>Paragraph (a)(3): Mercantile locations. </T3>This provision allowsoptometrists to locate their practices inside retail optical stores, departmentstores, or other mercantile establishments. Optometrists can also locatein shopping malls or adjacent to optical retailers. Under the rule corporationsand other entities that offer optometric services by employing optometristsor otherwise affiliating with optometrists, pursuant to andSection; 456.4(a)(1)of the rule, can also locate in mercantile locations. Consequently, the rule also eliminates so-called ``two-door'' or ``side-by-side''requirements, which are frequently used to prohibit optometrists from locatingdirectly inside mercantile establishments. These requirements mandate separateoffices for the optometrist and the optician, including, in some instances,separate doors and duplicate facilities and partitions between the twooffices. Under the rule, states could not require separate offices, separateentrances, duplicate facilities, or partitions. Finally, as andSection; 456.5(a) makes clear, the rule is not intended tointerfere with the state's ability to enforce general zoning laws or anylaw, rule, or regulation which prohibits the location of an optometricpractice in an area which would create a public health or safety hazard.<T3>Paragraph (a)(4): Trade Names.\1\\6\\6\</T3><NOTE/> The rule invalidates state prohibitions on optometrists'practicing under any nondeceptive trade name. Thus, for example, optometristsemployed by a chain firm could practice under the name of the chain firmas long as the name was not deceptive. Optometrists working for other optometristscould practice under the name used by their employer. Optometric franchiseescould practice under the franchise name. Solo practitioners could adoptany nondeceptive trade name. Corporations and other entities which offeroptometric services through affiliations with optometrists, pursuant toandSection; 456.4(a)(1) of the rule, could also practice under any nondeceptivetrade name. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\6\ Section 456.1(j) of the rule as originally proposeddefined the term ``trade name ban.'' The rule incorporates the substanceof this definition in this section, which bars states from prohibitingthe use of trade names. Thus, a separate definition is unnecessary.Some states, for example, require that any trade name include the nameof one or more of the optometrists practicing under the trade name.\1\\6\\7\<NOTE/> Such requirements would violate the rule since they prohibituse of a wide variety of nondeceptive trade names, including some thatare well-established in other states. Other states require that all tradenames used by optometrists include the word ``optometric'' or ``optometrist.''\1\\6\\8\<NOTE/> Trade names which do not include these terms, such as ``SmithOptical Center,'' are not in general, deceptive. Such a requirement wouldalso be prohibited under the rule, since it would prohibit the use of allother nondeceptive trade names.\1\\6\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\7\ See, e.g., La. Rev. Stat. Ann. section 1112 (West1952); Mo. Admin. Code Tit. 4, CSR 210-2.060(4)(E) (1984); Or. Admin. R.section 852-300-010 (1984).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\8\ See, e.g., Minn. R. 6500.0800, Subp. 3 (1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\9\ In fact, use of the term ``optometric'' in the tradenames of large chain firms could well be confusing to consumers since theterm may imply that optometric services are available at all the chain'sretail locations when, in fact, this may not be the case. The rule also allows optometrists to advertise under a trade name in anondeceptive manner. For example, optometrists could display their tradenames on signs and use the trade name in media advertising. Similarly,chain firms offering eye exams could advertise optometric services underthe trade name. The rule also prohibits states from mandating that any trade name advertisementdisclose the names of all optometrists practicing at a given advertisedlocation or practicing under the advertised trade name. However, as andSection; 456.5(a) (3) and (4) make clear, the rule does notinfringe on the state's ability to enforce any law, rule, or regulationwhich requires that the identity of an optometrist be disclosed to a patientbefore, during, or after the time optometric services are provided or ophthalmicgoods are dispensed or from enforcing any state law, rule, or regulationthat is reasonably necessary to prevent the deceptive use of trade namesin advertising. Also, the rule would not prevent states from imposing reasonabledisclosure requirements on any trade name advertising. <ITAG tagnum="81">Sections 456.4(b) and 456.5(b): Enforcement Policy</ITAG>The Commission expects that the states will comply voluntarily with therule. If, however, a state or local governmental agency or official attemptsto enforce a state law or regulation that conflicts with the rule, andSection;456.5(b), while not creating a private right of action, recognizes thatindividuals can interpose the rule as a defense in any proceeding broughtby the state. In such a situation, a person could correctly assert thatthe rule preempts the state law or regulation and therefore there is nobasis on which any enforcement action could be brought. Because the Commissionexpects the states to comply voluntarily with the rule, it does not anticipatebringing any law enforcement actions against state or local governmentalagencies or officials. Section 456.4(b) of the rule also provides thatno state or local governmental agency or official is liable for civil penalties,consumer redress, or other monetary relief that would ordinarily be availableunder the FTC Act for violations of this rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 456.5: Declaration of Commission Intent</ITAG><T3>Paragraph (a): </T3>Section 456.5(a) is intended to make clear thatthe rule does not affect any state regulation as long as the state doesnot engage in the specific practices enumerated in andSection; 456.4(a) (1)-(4).Thus, the rule does not interfere with a broad range of state regulationthat safeguards the health and safety of eye care consumers, or preventsunfair or deceptive practices or anticompetitive conduct by eye care providers,including commercial practitioners. For example, many states specify thatparticular procedures must be performed each time an optometrist performsan eye examination or that every optometrist's office must have particularequipment. Many states require that optometrists refer cases of suspectedpathology to ophthalmologists, or require that optometrists verify theaccuracy of lenses prepared according to their prescriptions. All statesprohibit fraud and deception in the practice of optometry and virtuallyall require that optometrists practice ``competently.'' \1\\7\\0\<NOTE/> The rule does not interfere with a state's ability to regulateoptometry, including commercial practice, through such regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\0\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 45-46.We also acknowledge that a state or local government can enact regulationthat may have an incidential impact on the ability of optometrists to engagein the specific practices covered by the rule, as long as the regulationdoes not distinguish between commercial and noncommercial optometristsor optometric firms. Thus, the rule does not invalidate state labor laws,antitrust laws, zoning laws, or other state or local regulation that mayhave an incidential impact on the ability of optometrists to engage inthe conduct protected by the rule.<T3>Paragraph (b): </T3>See analysis of andSection; 456.4(b) for a discussionof the Commission's views regarding the ways in which the Commission intendsthe rule to be enforced.<T3>Paragraph (c): </T3>See analysis of waivers and disclaimers of liabilityin andSection; 456.2(d).VI. Alternatives ConsideredDuring the course of this proceeding the Commission carefully consideredalternative approaches to the promulgation of a rule. We also consideredadopting a broader prohibition on commercial practice restraints_one thatwould reach indirect as well as direct bans_and considered various proposedmodifications to the existing prescription release provisions. Each ofthese alternatives is discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Alternatives to Promulgation of a Rule</ITAG>1. <T3>Take no action; defer to the states.</T3> The Commission could leaveto the states the decision whether or not to eliminate these restrictions.The Commission could continue to make its staff studies and other evidenceavailable to state legislatures and regulatory agencies, or could developa model state law, in the hope that states would take corrective actionin this area. However, the prospects for significant change are dim. TheBE Study has been available since 1980, and staff has testified or submittedcomments in support of deregulation of commercial practice in a significantnumber of states.\1\\7\\1\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, the record indicates that such restrictionsare still widespread.\1\\7\\2\<NOTE/> Based on this record we have no reason to expect that morethan a few states will voluntarily repeal commercial practice restrictionsin the foreseeable future.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\171\ Comments regarding restrictions on the commercial practiceof optometry have been submitted to at least nine states, including California,Delaware, Kansas, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas,and Virginia.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\172\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 33-46.2. <T3>Case-by-case approach.</T3> A second alternative would be to issuecomplaints and proceed on a case-by-case basis against particular statesor state regulatory boards.\1\\7\\3\<NOTE/> Rulemaking appears to be the more appropriate vehicle fora number of reasons, especially since nearly all of the states would beaffected. Rulemaking procedures permit all affected and interested parties,including all potentially affected states, to participate in a full andopen discussion of the issues and to present evidence for and against theproposal. In a rulemaking proceeding, the Commission can assess the implicationsof the proposal on a nationwide basis more readily than in a case againstone state. In addition, promulgation of a rule would provide more completeprotection for consumers. Even if an order were issued against a particularstate or state regulatory board, that order would not extend to other stateswith similar restrictions. Thus, significant numbers of consumers wouldbe left without relief in other states. Case-by-case adjudication againsta number of states would be more time-consuming and costly than rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\173\ Proceeding against private associations would not beeffective since it would do nothing to remove the state-imposed restraintsat issue in this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Alternative Rule Provisions</ITAG>1. <T3>Commercial Practice_Direct and Indirect Bans.</T3> The rule as proposedat the start of this proceeding covered state restraints that directlyor indirectly prohibited commercial practice.\1\\7\\4\<NOTE/> Such a formulation would have given the Commission the greatestflexibility in reaching indirect attempts to prohibit commercial practice.At the same time, the Commission was mindful that such an approach arguablywould invalidate many laws and regulations not specifically enumeratedin the rule. We chose to promulgate a more limited rule that defines theinvalidated restrictions very clearly in order to eliminate any uncertaintyregarding which laws or regulations are affected by this rule. The rulesets out four types of state laws that act as direct restraints on thecommercial practice of optometry: (1) Bans on lay association; (2) limitationson branch officies; (3) bans on mercantile locations; and (4) bans on tradenames.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\174\ See 50 FR 598 (1985). This intention was specificallystated in proposed andSection;andSection; 456.5 (b) and (c).Additionally, we have clearly identified and incorporated into the rulefour other types of restraints that interfere with activities essentialto the functioning of commercial practice: (1) Bans on the sharing of profits(andSection; 456.4 (a)(1) (i)); (2) bans on lay control over the businessaspects of a practice (andSection; 456.4 (a)(1) (v)); (3) requirements thatspecify that owners of branch offices remain in personal attendance ateach branch for a specific percentage of the time that the branch is open(andSection; 456.4 (a)(2)); and (4) requirements that mandate the disclosurein advertising of the names of all optometrists practicing at a given advertisedlocation or practicing under a trade name (andSection; 456.4 (a)(4)).The rule is now much narrower. It proscribes only those specified typesof state laws and regulations that the record demonstrates create seriousbarriers to the formation and operation of commercial optometric firmsand thereby cause significant consumer injury.2. <T3>Prescription Release.</T3> On June 2, 1978, the Commission promulgatedthe Eyeglasses Rule.\1\\7\\5\<NOTE/> That rule, in pertinent part, requires optometrists and ophthalmologiststo release to their patients copies of their eyeglass prescriptions immediatelyfollowing eye examinations regardless of whether or not the patient requeststhe prescription.\1\\7\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\5\ 43 FR 23,992 (1978) (codified at 16 CFR 456).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\6\ The rule also prohibits optometrists and ophthalmologistsfrom charging additional fees for the prescriptions, from conditioningthe availability of eye examinations on the purchase of ophthalmic goods,or from including waivers of liability on the prescription. These provisionswere upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1980. <T3>American Optometric Assoc. v. FTC</T3>, 626 F.2d 896 (DC Cir. 1980).The Commission found that many consumers were being deterred from comparisonshopping for eyeglasses because optometrists and ophthalmologists refusedto release eyeglass prescriptions even when requested to do so, or chargedan additional fee for release of the prescription.\1\\7\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission promulgated an automatic release requirementbased on a finding of ``consumers' lack of awareness that the purchaseof eyeglasses need not be a unitary process''_i.e., that purchasing eyeglassescan be separated from the process of obtaining an eye exam.\1\\7\\8\<NOTE/> The automatic release provision was thus imposed as a remedialmeasure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\7\ In addition, some practitioners refused to conductan examination unless the patient agreed to purchase eyeglasses from thepractitioner or included potentially intimidating disclaimers of liabilityon the prescription itself. 43 FR 23992, 23998 (June 2, 1978).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\8\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 251-52. In this proceeding the Commission considered whether or not the prescriptionrelease requirement should be modified or extended. The major modificationconsidered was amendment of the rule to require that prescriptions be providedonly upon request of the patient. In addition, the Commission asked forcomment on five other possible changes in the rule.\1\\7\\9\<NOTE/> The Commission considered the record evidence on each ofthese proposals and chose not to adopt any of them for the reasons outlinedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\9\ (1) Should the rule require optometrists and ophthalmologistsonly to offer, rather than give, eyeglass prescriptions to their patients?(2) Should the requirement be repealed altogether? (3) Should the rulebe extended to require the release of contact lens prescriptions to patients?(4) Should the rule be extended to require optometrists and ophthalmologiststo release duplicate copies of prescriptions to patients who lose or misplacetheir original copies? and (5) Should the rule require dispensers of eyeglassesto return the eyeglass prescription to patients after filling the prescription?50 FR 602-03 (1985).a. <T3>Automatic Release.</T3> The Commission decided to retain the remedialaspect of the prescription release requirement after consideration of twosurveys\1\\8\\0\<NOTE/> placed on the rulemaking record, as well as numerous commentsand testimony offered by optometrists, opticians, professional associations,state boards, and consumer groups. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\0\ The Market Facts Study, supra note 18, developedby staff in conjunction with the Market Facts Public Sector Research Group,was designed to measure eye doctors' compliance with the prescription releaserequirement and consumer knowledge and experience with prescriptions. TheAmerican Association of Retired Persons also submitted a survey conductedin 1985. That survey polled older consumers to determine their familiaritywith eyeglass prescriptions. AARP Survey, J-37(b) (Attachment to Statementof E. Eggan, Director, American Ass'n. of Retired Persons). Our reading of the record reveals that there is significant non-compliancewith the automatic release requirement\1\\8\\1\<NOTE/> and that there continues to be a lack of consumer awarenessabout prescription rights. Given that the record does not contain sufficientevidence to conclude that the remedial aspects of the rule are no longerneeded, we decline to modify or repeal the rule.\1\\8\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\1\ The Market Facts Study concludes that 44% of refractionistsare not in compliance with the rule and that an additional 19% are onlyin partial compliance. See also Presiding Officer's Report, L-2, at 24-25,which concludes that noncompliance remains a problem and recommends thatthe rule not be modified.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\2\ Little evidence was presented in response to theCommission's question regarding an ``offer'' requirement. Comments fromparties on opposing sides of the release upon request or repeal issuesgenerally opposed the use of an offer in lieu of their favored position.b. <T3>Contact Lens Prescription Release.</T3> The NPR requested comment onwhether significant numbers of consumers were refused copies of their contactlens prescriptions, whether consumers could reasonably avoid these refusals,and what are the costs and benefits of extending the prescription releaserule to contact lenses.\1\\8\\3\<NOTE/> While the record suggests that it is not uncommon for practitionersto refuse to give patients copies of their contact lens prescriptions,\1\\8\\4\<NOTE/> and that the resulting costs to consumers could be significant,\1\\8\\5\<NOTE/> we do not believe that the record contains sufficient reliableevidence to permit a conclusion that the practice is prevalent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\3\ 50 FR 603 (1980).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\4\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 283-87.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\5\ Id. at 288-89. Moreover, even if the evidence on prevalence of refusal to release contactlens prescriptions and resulting injury to consumers were satisfactorilydocumented, we would have to consider if any countervailing benefits justifiedthe refusal. Some commenters suggested that refusal to release is necessaryto permit the fitter to verify the fit of the lens\1\\8\\6\<NOTE/> on the eye because there is some danger that lenses may notconform to the eye as expected.\1\\8\\7\<NOTE/> According to these commenters, it would be inappropriateto require them to release contact lens specifications to their patients,since patients could then obtain replacement lenses from dispensers thatdo not verify the fit.\1\\8\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\6\ This need varies somewhat between hard and softcontact lenses. Hard lenses are ordered according to the fitter's specificationsand, in many cases, are then modified or finished by the fitter on a custombasis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\7\ E. McCrary, Vice President, Maryland OptometricAss'n, Tr. 182; G. Easton, President-elect, American Optometric Ass'n,Tr. 154; H. Haneln, Pennsylvania Optometrist, Tr. 2316-18; T. Vail, IllinoisOptometrist, H-115, at 9.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\8\ Some optometrists expressed fear that they couldbe held responsible for damage caused by lenses dispensed by others pursuantto their prescriptions and specifications. R. Saul, Florida Optometrist,H-93, at 3-4; A. Gossan, Michigan Optometrist, H-1.Because the record evidence is insufficient to evaluate this claim fully,the Commission cannot conclude that a refusal to release a contact lensprescription is an unfair act or practice.c. <T3>Other Prescription Release Matters.</T3> The Commission received nosubstantial evidence showing that practitioners refuse to release duplicatecopies of prescriptions to patients who lose or misplace their originalcopies, or that eyeglass dispensers refuse to return prescriptions to patientsafter filling the prescription.\1\\8\\9\<NOTE/> Because we do not have sufficient evidence to show that eitherof these practices is prevalent, rulemaking in these areas would be inappropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\9\ See Final Staff Report, L-1, at 297-99.VII. OtherMatters<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG>Before the Commission determines that an act or practice is legally unfair,we analyze the act or practice in terms of the scope and nature of theinjury it causes and in light of any offsetting benefits it provides. Insections II. B. and C., we set out a detailed summary of the injury imposedby commercial practice restrictions and the absence of any countervailingbenefits that might justify the restrictions. However, we also must considerthe projected benefits and effects of the rule that we are promulgating.\1\\9\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\0\ Federal Trade Commission, Rules of Practice, andSection;1.14(2)(iii). 1. <T3>Effect on Consumers. </T3>The primary benefit to consumers from theremoval of commercial practice restrictions is that they will be able topurchase vision care goods and services at lower prices without any compromisein quality of care. The record evidence indicates that (1) Prices are significantlylower in markets where commercial practice is not restricted; (2) commercialoptometrists charge lower prices than noncommercial optometrists; (3) noncommercialoptometrists who operate in markets where commercial practice is permittedcharge less than their counterparts in markets where commercial practiceis prohibited; and (4) overall quality of care is no lower in nonrestrictivethan in restrictive markets. As restrictions on commercial practice areremoved, competition among optometrists should increase. Lower prices shouldthen result from this increased competition and from economies of scaleachieved by larger optometric providers. Lower prices will also increasethe availability of ophthalmic goods and services to consumers who beforecould afford such services infrequently, or in some instances, not at all.Implementation of the rule will have no adverse effect on consumers. Theywill be able to obtain the same overall quality of care, but at lower prices.Finally consumers will benefit from their ability to choose, if they wish,the convenience of one-stop service (eye examinations plus eyeglass orcontact lens dispensing) from optometrists or retail optical firms whoemploy optometrists.2. <T3>Effect on Industry Members.</T3> The rule will directly affect allopthalmologists and optometrists who perform eye examinations and all optometrists,opticians, and others who desire to engage in commercial ophthalmic practice.In 1982, there were approximately 12,000 ophthalmologists, 22,000 optometrists,and 26,000 opticians in active practice in the United States. Most ophthalmologistsand optometrists are self-employed. The majority of opticians are self-employedor employed in ``independent'' retail optical establishments.The rule will give members of the optometric industry greater freedom toprovide goods and services in the most cost-effective manner. They willbe able to enter into business affiliations with nonoptometrists, own andoperate several branch offices, use a trade name for their practice, andlocate their practices in retail or mercantile settings. In a less-restrictiveregulatory environment, they will have greater opportunity to develop innovativeways of offering services and goods to consumers. Corporations or otherbusiness entities presently selling opthalmic goods would be able to hire,lease space to, or associate with optometrists in order to offer one-stopshopping to consumers.No direct costs would be imposed on optometrists, ophthalmologists, oropticians by the removal of state bans on commercial forms of practice.The rule would only permit, not require, providers to operate branch offices,maintain offices in mercantile locations, use trade names, or affiliatewith lay corporations and individuals.The only ``costs'' borne by industry members would be those created bydoing business in a market where greater consumer choice stimulates morecompetition. The indirect effects of the rule on various industry memberscannot be determined with any degree of precision, and will depend at leastin part on how individual providers respond to the changing market conditions.For example, some noncommercial optometrists may be forced to adopt morecost-effective business practices or lower their prices in order to meetincreased competition. In markets where commercial practice is now prohibited,it can be anticipated that commercial firms will enter.3. <T3>Effect on Small Entities.</T3> The primary impact of the rule on smallentities will stem from the increased competition in the vision care industrywhich can be anticipated as a result of the rule's deregulatory effects.The economic impact on individual small entities from increased competitionin the vision care industry, although difficult to determine, could besubstantial. However, the provisions of the rule that remove certain governmentalrestraints on commercial ophthalmic practice would permit small entities(i.e., optometrists and opticians) to engage in alternate modes of practice,including commercial practice, or to expand, should they desire to do so.The rule could hurt some small entities and benefit others, depending onhow they respond to a more competitive market. In states that currentlyrestrict commercial practice, for example, the market will become moreflexible and capable of responding to consumer demand. Those small entitiesthat have been denied the opportunity to engage in more efficient businesspractices will now be able to do so.Date from studies of the ophthalmic market indicate that this market isprice elastic: that is, as prices of eye examinations and eyeglasses decline,there is a proportionately greater increase in consumption. Thus, we anticipatean increase in total expenditures for vision care products and services.However, the market will be a more competitive one. Some less efficientproviders will undoubtedly lose business.4. <T3>Effect on Government Entities.</T3> The rule invalidates state statutesand regulations that ban commercial forms of practice. Thus, state andlocal regulatory agencies would not have to bear the costs of enforcingthese bans. However, other indirect costs might arise should state or localofficials decide to enact new regulations in areas not covered by the rule.In addition to the costs involved in enacting such regulations, the regulatoryagencies might incur additional enforcement costs.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B.

In exercising its authority to safeguardthe health and safety of eye care consumers or to protect the public fromunfair or deceptive practices or anticompetitive conduct, a state or localgovernment can enact regulation that has the incidental effect of preventingan individual optometrist or optometric firm from engaging in a specificagreement or activity covered by andSection;456.4(a)(1)-(4), as long as suchregulation does not distinguish between optometrists or optometric firmsthat engage in any of the agreements or activities enumerated in andSection;456.4(a)(1)-(4)and optometrists or optometric firms that do not engage in such agreementsor activities. For example, the rule does not prevent states or local governmentsfrom prohibiting the location of an optometric practice in an area thatcould create a public health or safety hazard, or from enforcing a generalzoning regulation, even though such prohibition or regulation had the incidentaleffect of preventing an optometrist from locating in some specific commerciallocation. While the rule affects state or local regulation of the businessaspects of the practice of optometry, it is not intended to interfere withthe authority of a state or local government to: (1) Prohibit improper lay interference in the ophthalmic care provideda patient by an optometrist; (2) Require that the optometric services provided at a branch office besupplied by a person qualified to do so under state or local law; (3) Require that the identity of an optometrist be disclosed to a patientbefore, after, or at the time optometric services are performed; (4) Prevent the deceptive use of trade names or prevent trade name infringement;or (5) Establish and maintain minimum quality standards for ophthalmic goodsor services. (b) The Commission intends that this rule may be used as a defense to anyproceeding of any kind that may be brought against any optometrist, orany entity formed by any agreement covered by andSection;456.4(a)(1) of therule, for using a trade name, working for or affiliating with a personwho is not an optometrist, operating branch offices or practicing in amercantile location. (c) In prohibiting the use of waivers and disclaimers of liability in andSection;456.2(d),it is not the Commission's intent to impose liability on an ophthalmologistor optometrist for the ophthalmic goods and services dispensed by anotherseller pursuant to the ophthalmologist's or optometrist's prescription.(d) The rule, each subpart, and the Declaration of Commission Intent andtheir application are separate and severable. <ITAG tagnum="84">Separate Statement of Chairman Daniel Oliver, Ophthalmic PracticeRule Statement of Basis and Purpose </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the Commission voted to promulgate the Ophthalmic Practice Rule,I questioned the use of the Federal Trade Commission rulemaking authorityto strike down state laws that restrict competition in the eye care market.Based on principles of federalism, I voted against the proposed rule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The restraints at issue are clearly anticompetitive and adverselyimpact consumers.
