We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping groundsfor polluting waste. There is a particular problem with thedeterioration of coastal waters. To ensure the sustainablemanagement of the marine environment, we recognize the importance ofinternational cooperation in preserving it and conserving the livingresources of the sea. We call for the relevant bodies of the UnitedNations to prepare a report on the state of the world's oceans.   We express our concern that national, regional and globalcapabilities to contain and alleviate the consequences of maritimeoil spills be improved. We urge all countries to make better use ofthe latest monitoring and clean-up technologies. We ask allcountries to adhere to and implement fully the internationalconventions for the prevention of oil pollution of the oceans. Wealso ask the International Maritime Organization to put forwardproposals for further preventive action.   47. We are committed to ensuring full implementation of existingrules for the environment. In this respect, we note with interestthe initiative of the Italian government to host in 1990 a forum oninternational law for the environment with scholars, scientificexperts and officials, to consider the need for a digest of existingrules and to give in-depth consideration to the legal aspects ofenvironment at the international level.   48. We advocate that existing environment institutions bestrengthened within the United Nations system. In particular, theUnited Nations Environment Program urgently requires strengtheningand increased financial support. Some of us have agreed that theestablishment within the United Nations of a new institution mayalso be worth considering.   49. We have taken note of the report of the sixth conference onbioethics held in Brussels which examined the elaboration of auniversal code of environmental ethics based upon the concept of the``human stewardship of nature.''   50. It is a matter of international concern that Bangladesh, oneof the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, isperiodically devastated by catastrophic floods.   We stress the urgent need for effective, coordinated action bythe international community, in support of the government ofBangladesh, in order to find solutions to this major problem whichare technically, financially, economically and environmentallysound. In that spirit, and taking account of help already given, wetake note of the different studies concerning flood alleviation,initiated by France, Japan, the U.S. and the United NationsDevelopment Program, which have been reviewed by experts from allour countries. We welcome the World Bank's agreement, followingthose studies, to coordinate the efforts of the internationalcommunity so that a sound basis for achieving a real improvement inalleviating the effects of flood can be established. We also welcomethe agreement of the World Bank to chair, by the end of the year, ameeting to be held in the United Kingdom by invitation of theBangladesh government, of the countries willing to take an activepart in such a program.   51. We give political support to projects such as the jointproject to set up an observatory of the Saharan areas, which answersthe need to monitor the development of that rapidly deteriorating,fragile, arid region, in order to protect it more effectively.</TEXT><NOTE>DRUG ISSUES</NOTE><TEXT>   52. The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. Westress the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national andan international basis. We urge all countries, especially thosewhere drug production, trading and consumption are large, to joinour efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and tocarry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and thelaundering of its proceeds.   53. Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures withinrelevant fora:   _Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programsfor the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries.The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), and otherUnited Nations and multilateral organizations should be supported,strengthened and made more effective.
