Gold prices soared by as much as $9 an ounce. On the CommodityExchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery jumped$7.70 to settle at $406.30 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank inNew York quoted a late bid for gold at $406.25 an ounce, up $7.50from Thursday's late bid.   News that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev canceled Januaryappointments with foreign officials so he could deal with domesticproblems sparked the hike in gold prices but sent stock pricesskidding and frightened currency markets worldwide.   ``So much depends on him keeping peace in the Eastern bloc andto give enough room for progress to continue,'' said Jack Barbanel,managing director of First Global Managers in Princeton, N.J.   While foreign markets focused on Gorbachev's political health,domestic traders keyed in on a Labor Department report that showedthe unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent last month, whilethe addition of 142,000 non-farm jobs was weaker than expected.   ``The dollar dropped off rather sharply on the weak number,''said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co. The report gave further fuel to the argument that theU.S. economy is slowing and that the Federal Reserve might move tolower interest rates.   Foreign appetite for dollars is dampened when the yields on U.S.securities decline.   Traders also noted that the Fed entered the market to selldollars for yen, pushing the dollar lower against the Japanesecurrency.   A lower dollar will help ensure ``we have some advantage incontinuing the level of exports (to Japan),'' which in turn aids inimproving the trade deficit, Barbanel noted.   Despite the negative news, technical factors pushed the dollarhigher at the close of trading.   ``The volume was high, and trading was somewhat chaotic,''Flanagan said.
