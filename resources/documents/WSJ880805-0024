On a voice vote, lawmakers adopted an amendment adding the provision to a $632.6 million spending bill to meet unanticipated federal costs for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The measure, which is still pending, also would shift about $200 million within federal accounts.    The amendment, offered by Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah), would place a ceiling on the amount of the notes, which FSLIC often issues to purchasers of insolvent thrifts in order to facilitate the transaction. Supporters of the limit consider it a way of asserting congressional control over FSLIC expenditures, according to congressional aides.    The amendment includes a nonbinding statement that the notes carry the backing of the federal government. Thrift industry officials hope this pledge would encourage publicly held corporations, which might have been worried about FSLIC's financial status, to buy ailing thrifts.    Current law and regulations don't place a limit on the notes, according to a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC. The new ceiling isn't expected to limit the number of institutions the Bank Board plans to liquidate in the future, the spokesman said.    The provision isn't part of the House-passed version of the bill. A House-Senate conference committee is expected to reconcile the differences in the two bills. </TEXT></DOC>
