The closed-door sessions were held without ceremony at adowntown Caracas hotel.   Host President Carlos Andres Perez said a communique would beissued Friday describing ``the fundamental agreements that existamong us, and explaining how the political will to integrate oureconomies has strengthened.''   Nine presidents were to attend the conference, but PeruvianPresident Alberto Fujimori was prevented from leaving his countryat the last minute because he lacked congressional authorization.First Lady Susana Higuchi de Fujimori was to arrive Thursdayevening in his place.   Presidents attending were Carlos Menem of Argentina, FernandoCollor de Mello of Brazil, Patricio Aylwin of Chile, Cesar Gaviriaof Colombia, Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador, Carlos Salinas de Gortari ofMexico, Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay, and Venezuela's Perez.   The so-called Group of Rio was founded with eight members, andChile and Ecuador were accepted as members Thursday. Panama wassuspended from the group during the government of Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega. The inclusion of Bolivia and Paraguay was expectedto be announced Friday.   Perez and Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo said oilprices and what they called ``Latin American security on energymatters'' dominated most of Thursday's four-hour session.   Aylwin on Wednesday suggested the region create a Latin Americanand Caribbean investment fund with windfall profits generated byhigh priced oil and sales of other raw materials. He said he wouldraise the idea at the summit.   ``It would mean studying how nations of the continent can helpeach other reciprocally, taking advantage of the fortunes that somecountries might have at certain times,'' Aylwin said.   Conference sources said the Chilean leader's idea drewconsiderable interest.   Borja, whose OPEC nation is one of four Latin American oilexporters, said the oil price hikes posed problems for producing aswell as consuming nations. Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia alsoexport oil.   Although consuming countries face high and even devastatingexpenditures, producers risk runaway inflation through theinjection of massive funds into their economies, the Ecuadoranleader said.   Thus everyone should ``work to stabilize petroleum prices. Thecurrent increase doesn't favor anyone,'' he said.   He called on multinational oil companies and countries withlarge strategic oil reserves, such as the United States, to putstored oil on the market to force prices down.   Lacalle, whose nation imports all its oil, presented the otherside of the coin. Uruguay's oil bill will jump at least 10 percentas a result of the crises, he said.   On the Bush initiative, which proposes free enterprises zones inLatin America and forgiving some Latin debt to the U.S. government,Borja said it was the first time ``an American president isrecognizing that the Latin American foreign debt is a politicalproblem, not only an economic one.''   ``How can it not be political, if our democratic system dependson it?'' he asked rhetorically.   Lacalle was more enthusiastic, saying that as soon as Bushpresented his June 27 speech ``I called him up in the White HouseOval Office to tell him I'm 1,000 percent behind his initiative.''   But Lacalle said the general proposal must quickly be made moreconcrete.   The fight against drug traffic and environmental preservationare also important themes on the summit agenda.</TEXT></DOC>
