But someentrepreneurs doing business with banks that fail find theycan't necessarily expect charity from the FDIC.   Take Automated Business Systems andamp; Services Inc.,Riverdale, Md., a small computer-systems company that gotbehind in paying off a $6 million promissory note from theNational Bank of Washington. Last August, the Comptroller ofthe Currency declared the bank insolvent, and the FDIC wasput in charge of the remaining assets.</LP><TEXT>   Within days of the takeover, the FDIC's liquidatorsaltered the bank's relationship with ABSS by quashing a &quot;lockbox&quot; arrangement the company had negotiated with the bank'sprevious management. Under this arrangement, the bankcollected the company's billings from its customers in orderto pay down the company's bank debt, and then advanced enoughoperating cash to keep ABSS alive.   The FDIC continued to collect the billings -- but stoppedadvancing ABSS any money. With its cash flow interrupted, thecompany was temporarily unable to meet a payroll.   As ABSS's problems suggest, it is risky in a time ofbanking uncertainty to take banking arrangements for granted.Cody Buck, the FDIC's managing liquidator in the NationalBank of Washington case, says even grade-A borrowers couldfind their credit arrangements reversed by U.S. liquidatorsin the event of a takeover.   Mr. Buck says it's &quot;relatively common&quot; for the FDIC to cutoff a company's funds in the aftermath of a takeover. Heestimates that there were &quot;dozens&quot; of such instances in theNational Bank of Washington liquidation alone. &quot;It sounds alittle cruel capturing the cash flow,&quot; Mr. Buck says. But headds: &quot;Our job is to maximize recovery for all thecreditors.&quot;   Network Solutions Inc., a Herndon, Va., telecommunicationscompany, also had a conflict with the FDIC when the NationalBank of Washington failed. Its $7.5 million credit line wasclosed and its cash advances were cut back. &quot;The day the bankclosed we were without a source of cash,&quot; says Roger Evans,the company's chief financial officer. Without a hastilyarranged $1 million loan from Allstate Insurance Co., &quot;wewould have had difficulty meeting our payroll,&quot; Mr. Evanssays.   To alleviate its cash squeeze after the FDIC cut off theflow of funds from the bank, ABSS asked its customers, mostlygovernment agencies, to pay the company directly for itsservices rather than the bank, as specified in the paybackarrangement. But the FDIC fought back, warning that bypassingthe bank was illegal.   One company, Computer Data Systems Inc., Rockville, Md.,said it couldn't decide whether to pay the FDIC or ABSS andfeared it would be sued no matter which course it took.Therefore, it sent a check for $89,755 to the U.S. DistrictCourt and asked a judge to figure it out.   &quot;ABSS lost a contract producing $2.5 million a year simplybecause the FDIC intimidated the contractor into paying {itsbills to} the court,&quot; complains George Wichard, a consultantwho serves as ABSS's financial adviser.   Ultimately, enough clients paid their bills directly tothe company to keep ABSS afloat, Mr. Wichard says. ABSS alsoscrambled quickly to find new customers. Without the cashinfusion, ABSS could have folded, &quot;and the vast majority ofthe blame would have rested with the FDIC,&quot; Mr. Wichard says.   To be sure, ABSS had credit problems. Besides being behindon its repayments to the National Bank of Washington, it wastrying to cope with a $1.8 million Internal Revenue Servicetax lien at the time of the bank collapse.   But Mr. Wichard argues that the government and the defunctbank stood to recover the most money by ensuring ABSS enoughfunds to operate. He says the FDIC was shortsighted andcallous. &quot;The idea of putting 130 people out of work made nodifference to them whatsoever,&quot; he says.   Steven Seelig, the FDIC's director of liquidation, callsthis, &quot;A typical reaction of people who say `Lend me moremoney.'&quot; He says workout arrangements where the bank haspreviously agreed to advance funds to a troubled firm, asoccurred with ABSS, are almost certain to be axed by bankingregulators. &quot;Borrowers shouldn't look to the FDIC to be theirreplacement bank,&quot; he says.   Adds the FDIC's Mr. Buck: &quot;If a company is in default andhas an IRS tax lien against it, it probably wouldn't beprudent judgment for the receiver to be advancing moneythey've already recovered.&quot;   ABSS was founded in 1970. The company's specialty iscombining computer hardware of various sorts into a singleoperating system. Until 1985, it participated in a SmallBusiness Administration program that funnels federalcontracts to minority-owned firms. Clients in 1990 includedthe Department of Energy, the District of Columbia governmentand the U.S. Marshal's office.   In its peak sales years, in the mid-1980s, the company wasbringing in $12 million to $14 million in annual revenue.   A U.S. District Court turned down the company's request toenjoin the FDIC from collecting the firm's accountsreceivable. Mr. Wichard concedes that the FDIC holds nearlyall the cards in cases such as the one affecting ABSS. &quot;TheFDIC has absolute power to decide which agreements {withcustomers of failed banks} it will and will not honor,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Wichard says the long-term prospects for ABSS are&quot;bright and rosy&quot; if it reaches a satisfactory settlement ondebt repayment with the FDIC. But he offers this advice tosmall companies that find themselves in a similar pickle: &quot;Ifthe FDIC takes over your bank, keep your marketing effortgoing. If you can't bring in customers, survival isn'tpossible.&quot;   And he adds: &quot;Any small business creditor of a bank that'staken over {by federal banking regulators} needs to view theFDIC as a mortal enemy.&quot;   For his part, the FDIC's Mr. Buck offers this advice toentrepreneurs: &quot;Banks produce quarterly statements ofcondition. You ought to pay attention to them. Watch whattheir equity is and what the trend is in their earnings.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
