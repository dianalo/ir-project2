Most smaller exchanges also declined.    Tokyo share prices dropped off sharply at the opening of the afternoon session, and drifted downward for the rest of the day.    Steels and brokerages were lower, while a few high-technology issues were firmer, but traders said the overall market showed little direction.    &quot;People are just waiting for the market to get back some of its energy,&quot; said one trader.    The Nikkei index fell 130.24 points to close at 28079.18. Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section fell 8.43 to 2197.37.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell another 126.65 points to 27952.53.    Katsuyuki Amano, general manager at BHF Securities (Asia) Ltd., said on Monday that investors are nervous about a meeting of the West German central bank council scheduled for Thursday, and about the first revision of U.S. second-quarter real gross national product, also coming out Thursday.    Mr. Amano noted that Saturday would be first day of trading for the September account. Activity tends to perk up in the first two or three days of trading for the new month's account, and slows down in the days before the first trading for the new month.    &quot;I thought if anything, the market might be stronger Monday or Tuesday,&quot; he added. &quot;After that, not much can happen till after we see U.S. GNP revision and whether the Bundesbank hikes its Lombard rate.&quot;    If the Lombard rate is raised, Tokyo stocks will feel the effects immediately, Mr. Amano said. He added that the U.S. GNP is &quot;probably going to be revised upward in a way that reflects the strength of the U.S. economy.&quot;    Non-ferrous metals were higher almost across the board. Nippon Light Metal was among the largest gainers on the Tokyo exchange, rising 58 yen, or 7.6%, to 817 yen ($6.10). Sumitomo Light Metal was up 46 to 665, while Showa Aluminium was up 26 to 900.    Brokerages were lower almost across the board. Nomura Securities fell 90 to 3,690, while Yamaichi Securities was down 30 to 1,830, and Sanyo Securities dropped 50 to 1,910.    London share prices closed lower in slack trading, with participants concerned that U.K. interest rates may soon be raised again.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed 7.3 points lower at 1477.2. Volume was a scant 231.5 million shares, the lowest so far this year, and well down from 342.4 million shares Friday. The 100-share index closed 12.0 points lower at 1832.3.    The market remained depressed throughout the trading session by fear of another rise in U.K. base lending rates, which were raised to 11% from 10.5% two weeks ago. The U.K. government has triggered successive rate rises from a recent low of 7.5% in an effort to choke off potentially inflationary economic growth.    Participants now expect another rate rise to 11.5% may come soon. &quot;We certainly wouldn't rule out another rise in the short term,&quot; said Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities. But the government may wait to assess more data before acting, he added.    Participants are now focusing on Thursday's release of U.K. balance of payments data for July, which may provide more evidence of surging demand.    Blue-chip stocks ended mainly lower, with Glaxo Holdings off 8 pence at 960 pence ($16.30) and Imperial Chemical Industries down 8 pence at #10.10.    Property shares showed some of the sharpest falls, with participants reacting to weekend press reports of oversupply in the U.K. commercial property market. British Land fell 8 to 332, and Land Securities dropped 20 to 550.    Some companies with large cash holdings bucked the market's negative trend or contained their losses as participants reasoned they would benefit from any upward trend in interest rates. Hanson PLC ended down .5 to 142.5, and General Electric closed 1 lower at 162.    Frankfurt share prices eased across the board in nervous but light dealings, stumped by a strong dollar and market fears of an imminent rise in West German interest rates.    Traders said a surge in the dollar brought out fresh fears of an impending rise in German interest rates, increasing uncertainty in the market and moving a number of participants to the sidelines.    They said many believe a new round of securities repurchase agreements to be called Tuesday by the Bundesbank will come with an interest rate higher than the current 4.25%, with some talking about a 0.25-point rise in the repo rate to 4.50%.    Others believe a rise in the repo rate may be combined with a move by German monetary authorities to raise other interest rates. They say the Bundesbank may decide to raise the discount rate, currently 3%, at the council meeting Thursday.    &quot;Not everyone is convinced interest rates are about to climb in Germany,&quot; a trader at a major West German bank said. &quot;Still, a lot of people were unsure and insecure, so they chose to sell.&quot;    Traders said most sectors felt the impact of the market uncertainty. Even auto makers, which usually benefit from a stronger U.S. currency, slumped Monday, except Daimler-Benz, which gained 3.5 marks to finish at 656.5 ($346). The company said it expects production of passenger cars to rise 2% this year above 1987 output of 598,079 cars. Volkswagen slipped 1 to 252.5, Bayerische Motoren Werke was down 1.5 to 485, and Porsche lost 2.5 to 559.    Stocks also fell in Paris, Amsterdam and Milan. Prices rose in Zurich and finished mixed in Stockholm and Brussels.    Zurich was boosted by investors scouring second-tier shares for bargains. Action in blue-chip stocks was quiet.    Share prices closed lower in Singapore, Hong Kong, Manila and Seoul, were mixed in Sydney and higher in Wellington. Taipei stocks again rose to a new high.    Singapore's decline was the ninth in a row. Sentiment continued to be affected by the weak performances of overseas markets, brokers said.
