Wang Meng was the highest-ranking official to lose his job duringthe crackdown prompted by last spring's pro-democracy protests.   In a separate campaign, authorities have accused other topgovernment officials of corruption, according to official media anda source in Hong Kong. In addition to demanding more democracy, thestudent demonstrators had called for an end to widespread officialcorruption.   State-run China Central Television announced today that Wang, 54,had been removed from his post as culture minister by the StandingCommittee of the National People's Congress.   It said He Jingzhi, a poet and deputy head of the rulingCommunist Party's propaganda department, is taking Wang's place.Last month, he replaced Wang as party head in the Culture Ministry.   The television news, in explaining the dismissal, said, ``ComradeWang Meng is one of our famous writers (who) repeatedly asked to berelieved of his official posts to concentrate on his writing.''   However, there have been unconfirmed reports Wang was in troublesince the campaign against political dissent began two months ago.He did not appear with other ministers to extend greetings tomartial law troops after the suppression of student demonstrationsin Beijing and has not been seen in public since that militaryassault on June 4.   Wang's dismissal follows the purge June 24 of party chief ZhaoZiyang and Politburo member Hu Qili. Zhao has been blamed forpermitting ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or pro-Western thought, tospread throughout the party and the nation.   The appointment of Wang in 1986 was hailed by Chinese artists andintellectuals as an indication of the government's increasedtolerance toward freedom of expression.   Wang said upon his appointment that he wanted ``to build a kindof bridge between writers and the party Central Committee.''   ``I honestly support party policy and also honestly stand for thecreative freedom of writers. There's no contradiction,'' he said atthe time.   While in office, he maintained a careful balance between the twosides, publicly stating that artists must contribute to Communismbut privately encouraging creative expression.   Wang was one of the Chinese art world's leading victims of MaoTse-tung's ``anti-rightist'' campaign of 1957 and the 1966-76Cultural Revolution.   In 1957, he was condemned for a short story about apathetic partycadres and subjected to years of internal banishment and hard labor.He was not allowed to publish again until 1979, three years afterthe Cultural Revolution.   The latest accusation of corruption came in the official presstoday with the announced dismissal of Xu Yunian, the top tradeofficial in southern China's Guangdong province.   Xu, director of the provincial Foreign Economic Relations andTrade Committee, was under investigation for using $57,500 in publicmoney to buy an imported car and portable telephones for himself,the reports said.   He also used his position to obtain a five-room apartment for hisfamily, the official Xinhua News Agency said.   A source in Hong Kong said today that Liang Xiang, governor ofthe southern island province of Hainan, had also been removed.   Officials reached by telephone in Hainan would only say that``nothing has been decided'' on the fate of Liang, who was formerlyparty secretary in the special economic zone of Shenzhen adjacent toHong Kong.   On Friday, the Ministry of Supervision announced that TuhtiSabir, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, hadbeen ousted for ``abusing his power by supporting speculation andtaking bribes.''
