Grafcet isa graphical language for expressing control flow. Grafcet is used todesign parallel systems such as in a manufacturing environment. The controlconstructs covered in the paper are: conditional statement; while; do;for; switch; break; continue; goto; label; and null. The Grafcet usedin the paper is the language, as augmented by Savoir. The C programminglanguage is the one described by Kernighan and Ritchie. The translationis to be used as a reference for programmers to translate existing Csource code into Grafcet.</TEXT></DOC>
