(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>GRAPHICAL-INTERFACE SPREADSHEETSandM;Spreadsheets have a chance to beef up their share of PC software sales as thenew graphical user interfaces (GUIs) make financial number crunching easierfor many more people.andM;The spreadsheet remains the second-most-popular category in PC software,holding 24 percent of the market to word processors' 32 percent, according toInternational Data Corp., a research and consulting company in Framingham,Mass.andP;  An estimated 2.2 million spreadsheet packages were shipped in 1989,about 70 percent of them from Lotus Development Corp.andM;But Lotus 1-2-3's long dominance has been eroding.andP;  Competitor BorlandInternational Inc. has offered an unbeatable deal to Lotus customers: Send anoriginal page from a 1-2-3 manual -- in other words, prove you are alegitimate owner -- and get Borland's $495 Quattro Pro for less than $100.andM;Microsoft Corp. Excel's appearance as a GUI spreadsheet also stole some of1-2-3's thunder.andP;  Other competition came from three-dimensional or &quot;layered&quot;spreadsheets such as Boeing Computer Services Co.'s Calc and DacEasy Inc.'sLucid 3-D.andM;Quattro has a sort of character-based GUI, whereas Excel, Lotus 1-2-3/G andInformix Software Inc.'s WingZ, both for OS/2 and for Microsoft Windows, areall true GUI spreadsheets.andP;  Lotus Version 3.1 will operate under Windows butnot as a true Windows application.andM;Only recently has the GUI become the mark of a state-of-the-art spreadsheet.andO;It has taken quite a while to get past the constraints of power and speed inthe older PC platforms.andP;  But now that Windows 3.0 finally is a reality, lotsof new GUI spreadsheets are appearing.andP;  The catch is that to run them, youneed a 386 computer with at least 4M of RAM.andM;Buyers today expect their spreadsheets to deliver presentation-qualitydocuments with sleek graphics.andP;  GUI spreadsheets do so at the price ofacquiring powerful new hardware.andM;Another, hidden cost is that even experienced number crunchers must struggleup a new learning curve.andM;Tempted to Fine-TuneandM;Many people feel tempted to keep tweaking the output until it looks justright, long after all the calculations are done and approved.andP;  A GUI can turnfinancial wizards into layout artists -- probably not what their bosses hadin mind.andM;If you buy a GUI spreadsheet, be prepared to spend at least some timestudying layout and developing an artistic eye.andM;The cardinal advice given to desktop publishers also applies to you: Neveruse all your font options on one page.andP;  It will make your spreadsheet looklike a ransom note and take forever to print.andP;  Choose one or two fonts andstick with them.andM;Other costs of moving to a GUI spreadsheet include buying a VGA or Super VGAmonitor for your 386, as well as lots of memory and a large hard drive.andP;  Itmay be possible to run a GUI on a 286 computer, but you will find itsluggish.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.01 took up 360K RAM.andP;  You will find the new genre ofGUI software voracious for memory.andP;  Excel needs 1M at a minimum.andP;  By the timeyou install all the libraries that come with it, you have consumed another 2Mor so.andP;  Windows 3.0 needs 6M on a 386 computer just for installation.andM;If such demands seem burdensome to you, a GUI spreadsheet may not be worthit.andM;GUIs exist to make it easier to interact with a computer.andP;  They offer thesesignificant advantages over character-based interfaces:andM;* You can see two or more applications on-screen at the same time.andM;* You can manipulate information directly, moving or resizing objects withthe mouse.andM;* You can share data easily between applications, for example, movingdatabase information directly into a spreadsheet.andM;* F1 usually stands for help, F10 for the menu bar, F4 for quit and so on inGUI applications.andM;* Beginners find a GUI far easier than a character-based interface.andM;* In modern object-oriented programming parlance, the data and programs areone unit, which makes manipulation easier and more efficient.andM;When micro spreadsheets were brandnew, output had to be retyped in a wordprocessing program to make reports.andP;  Later, packages such as Enableincorporated the output into the word processor module.andP;  Next, it becamepossible to link the output dynamically to a document so that changes to thespreadsheet automatically carried across to the document.andM;Now the GUI has removed the need even to integrate output.andP;  In Excel, forexample, an entire document can be typed within the spreadsheet, formattedand printed in presentation quality, complete with graphs.andP;  But there is adrawback: Excel does not produce 3-D charts.andM;Going GraphicandM;Drawbacks or not, the PC world still is going graphic.andP;  After a slow start,Windows 3.0 has many new applications being written for it.andP;  Even formeradversaries like Lotus and Borland now endorse Microsoft Windows because theybelieve people will demand GUIs from now on.andM;As the graphical interface begins to take hold, even newer and better ways ofmanipulating data are emerging in office tools such as Hewlett-Packard Co.'sNew Wave.andP;  It goes a step beyond Windows by making a spreadsheet itself anobject in the bigger office picture.andM;The trend toward a homogeneous GUI environment can be seen on all platforms:X Window on Unix machines; SunOS on Sun Microsystems Inc. platforms; and IBMCorp.'s OS/2, Systems Applications Architecture and Office Vision.andM;It seems likely that such operating systems eventually will share a commonlook and file structure.andP;  But at the same time, a parallel trend is supplyingthe best of GUI features for a cost conscious, non-GUI environment.andM;Two examples of the latter trend show up in Quattro Pro and the databasemanager FoxPro from Fox Software Inc. of Perrysburg, Ohio.andP;  Both canmanipulate character-based windows and support a mouse.andP;  Like GUIs, they havepull-down menus and multiple windows.andP;  They fall short only in the lack ofon-screen fonts and icons.andM;Many MS-DOS spreadsheets also can do windowing on older PCs.andP;  They use dialogboxes, layers and mice.andP;  All they lack is icons.andM;MS-DOS adherents tend to gravitate toward applications like Quattro Probecause it has GUI convenience without the need for megabytes of memory orexpensive VGA boards and monitors.andP;  And it is less finicky than Lotus 1-2-3Release 3.0 about hardware incompatibility.andM;However, generally speaking, GUI spreadsheets today are more powerful andhave the most features of all.andP;  One valuable item, for example, is theability to exit the spreadsheet and later restart it just where you left off.andM;GUIs can show much more of a worksheet at a time with on-screen fonts.andP;  Andthey can display worksheets and graphs simultaneously.andM;The mouse makes movement from cell to cell a cinch.andP;  To draw borders, youmerely drag a horizontal or vertical bar to the required location.andP;  You caneven position it in the middle of a column -- a far cry from old 1-2-3.andM;Changing column widths also is a snap: Position the mouse on the columnborder at the top of the spreadsheet, click and drag to the new position.andO;You see the column widen or narrow, so you know when to stop rather thanrelying on trial and error as in the past.andM;GUI macros also make life easier.andP;  By storing them in a separate sheet thatcan be applied to any spreadsheet, you do not have to keep track of yourmacros.andM;But the biggest advantage of GUI spreadsheets comes from their scalable,multiple windows.andM;Older packages display only a limited part of the worksheet.andP;  Althoughpackages like SeeMore from Personics Corp. can help out a bit, they are farless useful than the variable column and row widths and many sizes ofreadable fonts of GUI spreadsheets.andM;In this specific area, the GUI spreadsheet outperforms even Quattro Pro,which can show simultaneous windows but cannot stretch the display withscreen fonts.andM;Best ShowandM;For all their touted mouse mobility, GUI spreadsheets actually give the bestperformance under a combination of mouse clicking and keyboard macros.andM;Many Windows users glue the mouse to their right hands and never discover theefficiency of keyboard shortcuts and macros.andM;If you do not have a mouse already, try the new 400- by 400-pixel mouse fromcompanies such as Microsoft or Logitech Inc.andP;  It makes a big differencecompared with older mice, including the Macintosh version.andM;Besides new GUI products, this Buyers Guide chart lists other spreadsheetscapable of graphs, multiple windows and professional-quality reports.andP;  Forexample, Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.2 comes bundled with Funk Software Inc.andO;Allways or can be used with PC Publishing Inc.andP;  Impress for a GUI feel.andM;The vast majority of micro spreadsheets still run under MS-DOS.andP;  There areonly three so far for OS/2: WingZ, 1-2-3 and Excel.andP;  And there are only threefor Windows: Excel, WingZ and Lotus 3.1.andP;  The last two hit the marketrecently.andM;At the top of the heap, Lotus sells seven spreadsheets for differentplatforms.andM;Informix comes in second with Smartware and WingZ for the Mac, and now WingZfor Sun Microsystems Inc. machines, Windows 3.0 and OS/2.andP;  Informix bundlesWingZ for OS/2 and Windows 3.0 in the same package for $499.andP;  Many othercompanies are readying spreadsheets for either Windows or OS/2.andM;New GenreandM;The new genre of macros almost resembles a complete programming language.andO;Excel's macro language, for example, is part of a global language somewhatsimilar to Basic, which will become the underlying macro language throughoutthe Windows environment.andM;Complete programs can be written in the macro to change how the spreadsheetlooks.andM;Macros come in two flavors: learn mode, where you build the macro as you goalong; and direct recording, where you type the commands into the macro.andM;With macros, you can generate complete models and even capture on-line dataautomatically.andP;  In fact, combined with the graphing, database management, andfont and alignment abilities already mentioned, macros almost fill the roleof an integrated package.andM;The older Windows' tardy execution no longer is viable objection to buyingGUI spreadsheets.andM;Even so, it seems likely that most buyers of GUI packages will be eitherfirst-timers or experienced 1-2-3 users who finally decided to upgrade to,say, 1-2-3/G under OS/2, which maintains complete compatibility with earlierversions.andM;Which package should you buy?andP;  Excel, like Lotus 1-2-3 before it, lacks someimportant features yet satisfies most users.andP;  More complex packages are WingZand Lotus 1-2-3/G for OS/2.andM;Many people still do quite nicely with Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.01 and itsadd-ins for 3-D graphs and what-you-see-is-what-you-get output.andM;Resistant to ChangeandM;Veteran 1-2-3 users have resisted change partly because they did not likeWindows and partly because their favorite still does the job.andP;  But now thatWindows 3.0 is available, 1-2-3 diehards should take a look at Excel.andM;It reads 1-2-3 worksheets without conversion.andP;  Its screen shows more.andP;  Thereare plenty of keyboard shortcuts when you get tired of the mouse.andP;  AndExcel's help facility uses 1-2-3 commands.andM;Excel for OS/2 feels and looks like Excel for Windows, making a futuretransition painless.andM;No doubt, Excel will introduce 3-D in its next incarnation.andM;At present, its database module has a Structured Query Language add-on forcomplex queries and manipulation of database files.andP;  It imports files, as is,from dBase and other leading databases.andM;If you are trying to decide between WingZ or Excel, remember that WingZ is atrue object-oriented package and strong graphically.andP;  You can even draw anarc or a pushbutton right in the middle of a worksheet.andM;However, WingZ has no elegant way of setting and resetting titles as inExcel, and it cannot import dBase and other types of files.andM;If you have a 286 machine, your best bet is Quattro Pro.andP;  It runs fast withinthe 512K limit, takes advantage of your video board and delivers many of thelatest features.andP;  When graphing a range, Quattro Pro is smart enough todecide on the best graph.andP;  In graphics mode, you can press the slash key andproceed to annotate and manipulate the graph as if you were running yourfavorite graphics package.andM;What else lies in the future for GUIs?andP;  Now that PC developers have learnednot to ignore de facto standards, they are making software compatible acrossplatforms and paving the way to data access from other applications.andP;  This isone of the great hidden benefits of GUIs.andM;Also, developers are providing tool kits for third-party add-ins.andP;  An exampleis Pioneer Software's Q+E, which works with Excel.andP;  Lotus 3.1 has a tool kitof C and assembler routines for add-in applications.andM;Ron Mileikowsky is a computer consultant in Potomac, Md.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
