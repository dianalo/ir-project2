The telephone industry's quest for an inexpensive pocketphone centers on devices that use the crowded spectrum ofradio frequencies. A tiny Encino, Calif., company has taken adifferent tack. Working with GTE's British Columbia Telephoneaffiliate, Light Ideas has designed a mobile phone that usesinfrared light. Unlike radio phones, such devices wouldn't beregulated by the Federal Communications Commission, allowinga service to be set up quickly.   The LitePhone sends infrared signals totransmitter/receivers, called TeleBeams, which are wired tothe public phone network. Special optical filters allow acaller to use the phone anywhere in a lobby or office withoutbeing cut off; the phone doesn't have to be pointed directlyat the receiver like other infrared devices, such as TVremote controls. Moreover, LitePhone transmission is brokendown into digital bits and sent in &quot;packets,&quot; makingeavesdropping difficult.   Bell Atlantic plans to sponsor a LitePhone demonstrationnext month in Philadelphia for other phone companies, saysGeorge Davis, Bell Atlantic's manager of wireless transport.He says he tried the phone last month at the MPR Teltech labsin Burnaby, British Columbia, and &quot;was blown away. Thetransmission was crystal clear, and it's so easy to installthat we could start a service next year.&quot; The devices need tobe tested, though, with the regular phone system.                                                                                                          `Palm Tops' Receive Text   Over a Paging Network                                                                                                          PAGING may soon mean more than tracking down someone.   Several companies are readying systems that send text tothe tiniest computers over radio paging networks -- for a lotless money than it would cost over cellular radio networks.Hewlett-Packard is combining its 95LX &quot;palm-top&quot; computerwith a new text pager, called Data Stream, from Motorola. Thecheckbook-sized 95LX, which is actually an IBM-compatible PCweighing 11 ounces, can be attached to the Data Stream, whichMotorola says can receive and store as much as 32,000 bits ofdata, several pages of text.   NCR has a notepad computer that can send and receive dataover the Ardis radio network run by Motorola andInternational Business Machines, and its Safari laptop ismade to communicate via cellular and paging systems.   Cue Network is testing an electronic box that works withthe Wizard pocket computer made by Sharp. Cue's box isinstalled in a car and stores data that's sent over Cue'snetwork. Customers can download the data into Wizards asneeded.   &quot;{Things} will soon get to the point where you can call acomputer by phone and tell it to send information over thepaging network to your hand-held computer,&quot; says StuartLipoff, a vice president of advanced electronics at Arthur D.Little Inc.                                                                                                          Soon, Homes May Need   Just Fiber-Optic Cable                                                                                                          THE DAY gets closer when all communications will come tothe home through one fiber-optic cable.   Phone companies say that by 2000, customers will have onephone line of optical glass running to their homes to handlevoice, data and video communications -- even FM radio. Recentbreakthroughs tend to validate the forecast.   GTE's labs in Waltham, Mass., recently developed alow-cost method for extending fiber-optic lines fromneighborhood telephone feeder boxes to homes. GTE scientistsetched a tiny chip of silicon with grooves that allow lasersthe size of a pinhead and hair-thin fibers to be mountedautomatically. GTE estimates that a 16-laser package isone-twentieth the size of today's individually packed lasersand requires 1% of the time to assemble.   That's significant because &quot;we have to bring the cost downto parity with a copper wire system,&quot; says Craig Armiento,research supervisor. He's not sure when that will happen,though.   GTE's advance comes about a year after the phone industryset a strict standard requiring all new fiber-optic equipmentto be built to the Synchronous Optical Networkspecifications. This should widen the field of suppliers andspur construction of &quot;broadband&quot; networks pumping voice, dataand TV to homes.                                                                                                          Computer Voice Systems   Help to Sort Letters                                                                                                          POSTAL WORKERS hope to save money by talking to theircomputers.   About a dozen big postal centers around the country areinstalling voice-recognition systems that help sort and batchletters, even into the mail carrier's bag, says Wayne Nelson,manager of the engineering technical unit at the OklahomaCity Post Office.   Mr. Nelson, whose center sorts mail for 820 postalstations and offices in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle,recently began installing the systems made by Verbex VoiceSystems, Edison, N.J. Responding to spoken commands, acomputer at the Oklahoma City center sorts mail sacksaccording to ZIP code. The new system uses one operator wholooks at the sack, notes its ZIP code and speaks the numberinto a headset microphone using a &quot;normal conversationalspeech,&quot; says Mr. Nelson. That's quicker than the old systemin which one operator handled the sacks and called out thenumber while another worker punched the ZIP code into akeypad. He estimates salary and productivity savings at morethan $200,000 a year.   But it's unclear how much the new gear will help cutoverall Postal Service losses, which last year hit $870million.</TEXT></DOC>
