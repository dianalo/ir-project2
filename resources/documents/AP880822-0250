An agreement signed over the weekend allows U.S. airlines to flyto Brisbane, Cairns and one other Australian city, to be chosen bythe United States, and then fly on to eight other Australiandestinations.   The two U.S. carriers serving Australia, Continental Airlinesand United Airlines, currently can fly to four Australian cities.   Under the new agreement, U.S. airlines also are allowed to applyfor service linking the United States and two Australian cities viaJapan. Australia's government-owned carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd.,can fly to 15 U.S. cities, compared with the four it now serves.The destinations will be chosen by Qantas.   Qantas also can fly from the United States to Canada, and willlater be able to fly from the United States to Europe without therestrictions it currently faces.   Houston-based Continental said it will increase the number ofweekly flights out of Australia to 19 from the current 16 by theend of October, and add another three flights to the United Statesby April.   United, the largest U.S. carrier, has not announced any proposedchanges. The airline's manager for Australia, Michael Merlini, saidthat prior to the agreement Chicago-based United already hadplanned to increase the number of weekly flights from Australia tothe United States to 14 from eight.   Qantas and the U.S. airlines also are expected to take advantageof the expansion through ``codesharing,'' or using a local airlineto book passengers on a through flight, according to a statement byGareth Evans, Australia's minister for transport and communications.   Under the agreement, both the U.S. airlines and Qantas canoperate on a new route between Guam and Australia.   An existing route between Australia and the United States viathe North Pacific, currently open only to U.S. airlines, will alsobe opened to Qantas.   The agreement also allows for automatic approval of capacityincreases in line with growth in passenger traffic.
