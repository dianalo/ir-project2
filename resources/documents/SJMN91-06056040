She goes back to the church on Sunday morningswhenever she can.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHE NEVER HAS FORGOTTEN HER ROOTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  People.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Your roots are what make you, and my roots are there,&quot; LaBelle said in theMarch issue of Applause, the PBS television magazine. &quot;I have to see myfriends, my people. I have to go there and just be Patti.&quot;;    LaBelle livesjust a few miles away in Wynnewood, Pa.;    Every visit &quot;feels good and alwayshas, except for the time I thought the church'd lock the doors on me and neverlet me back in,&quot; she said.;    LaBelle said she didn't know at first that her1970s hit song &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; was about a prostitute. &quot;I didn't know what itwas about. Nobody, I swear this is God's truth, nobody told me what I'd justsung a song about.&quot;;    When she found out, &quot;suddenly, I felt all alone, thatI'd done something wrong to the church, that I'd turned into some kind of badgirl,&quot; she said.;    &quot;It took courage and faith to go back,&quot; she said. &quot;But,when I walked in there, I got a few looks. And then I got the smiles and thehugs and the love. Hey, hookers are people too. Love is what it's all about,honey. Love is gospel, and gospel is love.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Compiled from Mercury News wire services.  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  276  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 25, 199100056040,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
