With Van Zant and Collins now both dead, we all should have had tearsin our eyes (and maybe some of us did) at hearing it performed again, but itwas so good to hear it that the smiles overcame the sadness.;   Rock 'n' rollnever dies; in the case of Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991, it hasn't even faded away. AnOct. 20, 1977, plane crash killed Ronnie Van Zant and guitarist Steve Gaines,along with singer Cassie Gaines, road manager Dean Kilpatrick and two pilots.The rest of the band was physically and/or emotionally injured, and LynyrdSkynyrd lived on only in the hearts and stereos of its fans.;   The survivorscontinued as performers in their own names, notably guitarists Gary Rossingtonand Collins (who died in January 1990 of pneumonia, four years after he wasparalyzed from the waist down in a car accident), and there was a LynyrdSkynyrd tribute reunion in 1987.;   But Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991 is the closestthing to a continuation of the old band we're going to get, with Ronnie'slittle brother Johnny picking up the microphone, and five members of the oldband -- Rossington, guitarist Ed King, bass player Leon Wilkeson, keyboardsplayer Billy Powell and drummer Artimus Pyle -- all picking up where they leftoff. (Pyle, who is on the &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991&quot; album, did not perform atShoreline.) New to the band are guitarist Randall Hall and drummer KurtCuster.;   The new album was only partly promising for long-time LynyrdSkynyrd fans because Johnny's recorded voice is a little higher and smootherthan Ronnie's deeper, more macho tones (and if you're talking Lynyrd Skynyrd,you're talking testosterone), and the songwriting didn't quite live up to themasterpieces of the old days. No &quot;Gimme Three Steps,&quot; &quot;Saturday NightSpecial,&quot; &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; &quot;Oooh That Smell,&quot; &quot;What's Your Name&quot; or &quot;FreeBird.&quot;;   But guess what? On stage the new songs, written by the 1991 band,cook like natural gas, and the old songs, as played by these guys, are stillhotter than kerosene on a campfire.;   And Johnny Van Zant on stage Saturdaywas powerful, sounding deeper and rougher (all that whiskey and smoking,perhaps?) and more like his brother, and taking the front-man part withhandsome features and what seemed like a heartfelt appreciation of both theaudience and the heritage he represented.;   The crowd -- maybe slightly morethan half of Shoreline's 20,000 capacity -- was on its feet and bonkers fromthe first tune, &quot;Smokestack Lightning,&quot; from the &quot;1991&quot; album. By the thirdtune, &quot;Saturday Night Special,&quot; there was no doubt that Lynyrd Skynyrd wasback, with its exciting monster three-guitar attack, the Dixie timing andheavy electric blues combining in music that rides down on our ears in layers.One guitar builds a rhythm and the other two weave solos in and out of it,with the bass thundering a strong foundation.;   Powell, the originalkeyboardist, underlined the strength of the new songs on &quot;Good Thing,&quot;pounding about about a million little-finger tinkles on the big white grand,leading into a fabulous finish involving him and the three guitars.;  Everyone was respectful of those who died, but those who live on partiedheartily. The old songs were played faithfully and powerfully, and on &quot;GimmeThree Steps&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot; especially, the band was backed by a chorus ofabout 9,000 voices.;   Opening bands were Little Caesar and Junkyard. Each hada vocalist backed by two guitars, a bass and drums. Little Caesar had moreleather and tattoos and better vocals. Junkyard had more cigarettes and betterguitarists. They all seemed, uh, angry about something.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN ORR, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910902  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  749  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 2, 199100246104,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
