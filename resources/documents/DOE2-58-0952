Simulated fuels corresponding toburnups of 5 to 30% FIMA were prepared by adding non-radioactive FP elementsto uranium in nitrate solution, evaporating the mixed solution to drynessand heating the pellet at 1273 to 2273 K under various oxygen potentials.The insoluble residue was obtained at the dissolution of the simulatedfuel with 3M HNO/sub 3/. The chemical composition of the residue wasdetermined by chemical analysis and the phases in the residue were identifiedby X-ray diffraction. The insoluble residue was composed mainly of Moand Ru with minor amounts of Pd and Rh. At some conditions Zr and Snwere also included. The amount of residue was less than 1 wt% up to a10% FIMA burnup, but increased markedly at a higher burnup. The amountof residue decreased at a temperature higher than 1873 K. This was attributedto the fact that the metallic {alpha}-phase formed at high temperaturewas apt to be easily dissolved in HNO/sub 3/. The amount of metallicresidue and Mo/Ru ratio decreased with the increase in oxygen potential.The oxygen potential for Mo-MoO/sub 2/ equilibrium may be related tothis result. Formation of the Zr-molybdate hydrated oxide compound, ZrMo/sub2/O/sub 7/ (OH)/sub 2/(H/sub 2/O)/sub 2/, was observed only in the residueat high burnups and high oxygen potentials. This phase was possibly formedduring the dissolution process.</TEXT></DOC>
