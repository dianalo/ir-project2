As Kelschsees it, the council's decision to take them down is only the latest evidenceof ill will toward Garland, whose drug-plagued life ended with an overdose ofsleeping pills in 1969.;   &quot;Up here, that kind of thing doesn't play toowell,&quot; Kelsch said. &quot;I had some guy come up to me just recently and say hedidn't think those signs should be up at all because she was nothing but apill-head. I hear all kinds of things like that from the general public.&quot;;  Garland fans are advised, however, that the historical society maintains alarge exhibit on her and promotes an annual festival that attracts visitorsfrom as far away as Australia.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Jim Jeffress  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910825  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  301  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, August 25, 199100238071,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
