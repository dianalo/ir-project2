The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration reached a similar agreement last November with IBP Inc. at 15 of that meatpacker's facilities.    Sara Lee, based in Chicago, agreed to a plan including use of ergonomic consultants. They will review work processes that may lead to cumulative trauma disorders, which include repetitive-motion injuries to workers' hands, wrists and arms, OSHA said.    The company agreed to use methods that will do the most to reduce the problem, including production line changes, rotating employees to less hazardous jobs, training workers and supervisors, early recognition of problems and quick medical diagnosis and treatment.    Sara Lee agreed to pay $20,000 in penalties and withdraw its contesting of OSHA citations for four alleged violations involving cumulative trauma disorders at the company's plant in New London, Wis., the agency said. Sara Lee officials weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
