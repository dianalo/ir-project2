Forstmann-Leff said Guinness Peat has given preliminary approval to the buy-back proposal. Final word on the transaction is expected within a month.    Pending that approval, Forstmann-Leff declined to disclose the amount of its offer for the 50% stake, which Guinness acquired three years ago for $90 million.    If Forstmann-Leff's bid succeeds, it will mark an unusual reversal in a wave it helped to start: foreign companies purchasing all or part of U.S. financial-services firms. That trend is expected to continue, but the Forstmann-Leff experience indicates that the marriages aren't always blissful.    &quot;We'd like to own ourselves back,&quot; said William F. Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff and one of five senior managers who sold the half-interest in 1986. &quot;The original {Guinness Peat} people we signed on with are gone,&quot; he said, &quot;and a lot of the synergies we expected never developed.&quot;    After the 1986 sales agreement with Forstmann-Leff, control of Guinness Peat was acquired by Equiticorp International PLC, a New Zealand financial-services group. Since then, Equiticorp International's finances have collapsed and its creditor banks have sought buyers for the Guinness Peat operations.    Mr. Harnisch said the turmoil hasn't affected the day-to-day operations of Forstmann-Leff, which currently manages $4 billion in client assets. But he said there were indirect consequences. In particular, a flow of foreign money that Forstmann-Leff expected to receive through Guinness Peat never materialized.    Going into the pact with Guinness Peat, &quot;we thought we would have access to international monies coming to the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Harnisch said. Since that hasn't happened, he said, &quot;From our standpoint and from our clients' standpoint, we would prefer to be on our own again.&quot;    Several deals involving big money-management firms have surfaced in recent weeks as Japan's Nikko Securities Co. agreed to pay $125 million for a 50% interest in Wells Fargo andamp; Co.'s investment advisory unit, and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said it would sell most of its Lehman Management Co. unit to a group including Lehman's management for about $100 million.    David N. Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management Inc., this week began informing clients that he planned to sell control of firm to a group led by leveraged buy-out firm Lodestar Group for $96 million. Industry observers called the price very attractive for a money-management firm, amounting to more than four times its annual revenue. Dreman Value has about $4.4 billion under management.    The transaction calls for Mr. Dreman and Dreman Value employees to keep a 25% stake in the firm and receive an additional 13% of its earnings for up to seven years. The share of earnings going to the firm's personnel other than Mr. Dreman could be further increased as an incentive. Key managers also will be given five-year contracts to keep them with the firm.    Lodestar President Ken Miller, former co-head of mergers and acquisitions of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said the firm decided to enter the money-management business several months ago. He said he expected to see more LBOs of money managers, but noted that &quot;you have to believe in cash flow-based financing because there aren't any assets here to speak of.&quot;    Leonard M. Harlan, principal in the LBO firm of Castle Harlan Inc. that led a $300 million buy-out last year of Delaware Management Co., said money-management firms are well-suited to LBO transactions. &quot;It's a business that doesn't require any Randamp;D, so all the cash that comes from operations is available to service debt,&quot; he said.    He also noted that in the Delaware Management transaction, which was the first of its kind, the LBO format boosted motivation within the firm by giving stakes to key personnel, many for the first time. &quot;Thirty-four members of management were made stockholders, and, boy, does that turn on the juices,&quot; he said.    Mr. Dreman said retaining control of his firm was central to his decision to sell. &quot;They are really going to let us run our show the way we've always run it,&quot; Mr. Dreman said of Lodestar yesterday. Regarding the reaction of the firm's 300 clients, Mr. Dreman said, &quot;We've gotten an almost an completely favorable response.&quot;    William F. Quinn, president of AMR Corp.'s investment arm with $125 million invested with Dreman Value, said several of the money managers he uses have been acquired with mixed results. &quot;Some continue just as before and produce good returns; others have become complacent,&quot; he said. &quot;Our practice has been to give people at least a year to prove themselves.&quot;    Other Dreman clients also said they would wait and watch Dreman Value's performance. &quot;It raises a flag, but I'm not sure it's red,&quot; said Terry Hanley, director of the Wyoming state retirement system with $60 million invested with Mr. Dreman. </TEXT></DOC>
