Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 9.12% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was down from the 9.3% rate a month ago and well below the 10.89% average rate a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Recent declines have left home-loan rates significantly below the 9.89% rate they hit in April, when falling rates set off a nationwide spree of home buying and refinancing. Rates rose slightly in late April, but fell thoughout the summer until mid-September. After a slight upturn, rates generally have continued to fall since then.    The low interest rates have encouraged brisk home buying. The Commerce Department yesterday said sales of new homes climbed a robust 12.7% in December after a revised 1% gain in November. The November performance initially was reported as a 2.2% drop. Economists generally expect continued strength in sales of single-family homes in the next few months, although most doubt that the December pace can be sustained.    For all of 1986, home sales rose 8.9%, after increasing 7.7% in 1985.    Meanwhile, a separate poll by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board also reflected the downward trend in mortgage rates. It showed that the average effective interest rate for fixed-rate mortgages early last month dropped to 9.86% from 10% in early December. The figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 25 years or more.    The Bank Board said lenders in early January were seeking an 8.68% average effective interest rate for the most popular adjustable-rate loans, those that restrict rate increases. That rate was below the 8.79% rate of early December. Similarly, the rate on adjustable mortgages without rate limits declined to 8.35% in early January from 8.43% the previous month.    The Bank Board also reported that the average price for a new home rose in early January to a record $133,400, surpassing the previous record of $127,500 set in October. In December, the average price of a new home was $124,800. The board first began reporting such prices in 1973.    Some analysts said the difference between rates charged for fixed-rate mortgages and those for adjustable-rate mortgages will boost the popularity of the adjustable loans. But the Bank Board reported that adjustable mortgages comprised only 25% of all home loans in early January, down from 35% in December. That was the first monthly decrease in the proportion of adjustable loans since June. The Bank Board first began tracking fixed and adjustable rates separately in September 1983.    Several analysts predicted that mortgage rates followed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. will continue to drop, but they differed in their assessments of how far the rates will fall and how long the decline will last.    Peter Knight, vice president for mortgage finance of the National Council of Savings Institutions, said the recent report &quot;confirms a trend that's been evident in the market. We expect the rates to go lower, bottoming out in late spring, probably reaching 8.5% in late spring in the metropolitan markets.&quot;    Michael Lea, the mortgage corporation's chief economist, was more cautious, saying only that he expected the decline in rates to continue through March.    While analysts generally agreed that low mortgage rates have helped spur new-home sales, few expect such sales to match last year's total of 749,000. &quot;We had a lot of pent-up demand which came into the market in the early part of 1986,&quot; said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.    The average term for all conventional mortgages that were closed in early January was 26.3 years, down slightly from 26.8 years a month earlier. Loans in January were an average 75% of purchase price, about equal to the previous month's level of 74.9% and about the same as in January 1986.    Last month's rise in home sales pushed them to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 from an annual rate of 685,000 in the previous month, according to the Commerce Department report.    Sales rose 81.3% last month in the Midwest to an annual rate of 136,000 units, following a 25% decline to a rate of 75,000 units the previous month. &quot;The Rust Belt renaissance may be for real,&quot; said James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. But other analysts attributed the December rise in home sales in the Midwest to unseasonably warm weather. </TEXT></DOC>
