(Data I/O Corp's Abel 4.0programmable logic device tool)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wilson, Ron.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A universal PLD design tool moves closer to reality as severalvendors announce fitters that translate the open intermediateformat of Data I/O Corp's Abel 4.0 designer to vendor-specificdesign data.andP;  Advanced Micro Devices is releasing fitters for itsMach 110 and 210 devices.andP;  Altera Corp is said to have fittersavailable for the three smaller members of its Max family and theEP1800.andP;  Atmel Corp is developing fitters for its ATV750, ATV2500and ATV5000 devices.andP;  A fitter is available for International CMOSTechnology's PA7024 Peel array, and National Semiconductor hasincluded a fitter in its MAPL product family.andP;  PLD users have beenincreasing vociferous in demanding a universal PLD tool, and PLDvendors have begun to realize the value of such a tool as well.andO;With a universal tool, PLD users are relieved of the necessity ofbuying a separate, vendor-specific tool for every device they wishto evaluate for potential use.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Data I/O Corp.
