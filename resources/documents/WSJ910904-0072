But Pyongyang's decision to agree to inspections hasn'tdissipated the skepticism of Western officials and analystswho have suspected for years that North Korea's refusal tosubmit to inspections was a ploy to gain time to produceenough nuclear material for military purposes.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. officials say satellite photographs show that inaddition to a 30-megawatt nuclear reactor now in operation inYongbyon, North Korea is building a plant to extractplutonium -- raw material for a nuclear weapon -- from thereactor's spent fuel, and also is constructing a reactor of&quot;several hundred&quot; megawatts. Fears that North Korea may havenearly enough material for a bomb has prompted increasedpressure from the U.S., South Korea and Japan on Pyongyang tosign the inspection agreement as a condition fornormalization of relations.   U.S. officials say the nuclear installations spotted bysatellites are not likely meant for power generation. Notonly are they far away from the industrial belt near theSoviet border, where power is needed, but photographs don'tshow any provisions for power transmission. Leonard Spector,a nonproliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace, says that with the 30-megawatt reactorin operation since mid-1987, the North Koreans could haveaccumulated enough spent fuel to extract plutonium for anuclear bomb.   U.S. experts don't believe that a plant designed toextract plutonium is in operation yet, and they say it maytake some time to complete. &quot;No one underestimates NorthKorean determination to get a bomb,&quot; says one administrationofficial. &quot;But given the work that remains to be done, itwon't be easy.&quot; Nonetheless, government experts havecautioned against complacence, because it is possible toextract plutonium manually through a simple contraptioncalled a hot box.   Continued skepticism about North Korea's true intentionshas been raised by indications that Pyongyang might delaydomestic ratification of the agreement, thus keepinginspectors from the installations suspected to produce bombmaterials.   The International Atomic Energy Agency agreement calls forimmediate implementation in countries whose constitutionsdon't require ratification. But North Korea amended itsconstitution in 1982 to give the country's president, Kim IlSung, authority to ratify any agreement with foreigninstitutions.   While North Korea signed the Nuclear NonproliferationTreaty in 1985, it didn't agree to reopen talks with the U.N.agency for signing the safeguards agreement until last May.Some observers saw Pyongyang's apparent concession as atactical move to facilitate its application for a seat at theUnited Nations, submitted at about the same time.   In the absence of any precedent, U.S. officials areconcerned about the ambiguous North Korean response tosoundings on this issue. Responding recently to a seniorWestern official's query about how long ratification wouldtake, a North Korean diplomat said &quot;it would depend on thecircumstances,&quot; according to the Western official.   Under the U.N. agency's regulations, North Korea wouldhave to submit a list of nuclear installations and allowinspectors to examine them and set up monitoring equipment.North Korea doesn't acknowledge the existence of nuclearinstallations other than a small research reactor that italready allows to be inspected by the agency. It remains tobe seen whether Pyongyang will maintain its position when thetime comes for it to provide a list to the agency. The agencycould challenge such an assertion, and the U.N. SecurityCouncil could move to force compliance with the agency'sregulations.   Some analysts believe North Korea has been shaken by thedestruction of Iraqi military and industrial installations.North Korean media have charged that the U.S. is planning astrike against North Korea &quot;on the pretext of removingsomeone's `nuclear threat.'&quot;   Whatever its motivation, North Korea's apparentwillingness to cooperate with the agency has encouragedinfluential observers to call for a flexible U.S. approach.In an article in Foreign Affairs, Asia specialist Alan D.Romberg and retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. suggest that aspart of a package to end unregulated North Korean nucleardevelopment, the U.S. should withdraw nuclear weapons fromSouth Korea and guarantee Pyongyang it won't use nuclearweapons against the North. (As a matter of policy, Washingtonneither confirms nor denies the existence of nuclear weaponsin South Korea.)   Mr. Spector of the Carnegie Endowment says, &quot;I'd besurprised to see the North Koreans do something dramatic.They may sign the agreement, but they would want a quid proquo before implementing it.&quot; Pyongyang, in fact, has starteda campaign to secure a quid pro quo by calling on the U.S. toallow inspection of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea andtheir removal, and to pledge not to use nuclear weaponsagainst North Korea. Washington has rejected any linkagebetween North Korea's compliance with the nonproliferationtreaty and U.S. security arrangements with South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
