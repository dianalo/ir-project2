In the suit, he claims his civil rights were violatedbecause he was taken into custody.;   The lawsuit, filed last week in AlamedaCounty Superior Court, seeks unspecified damages for intentional and emotionaldistress and names the city, Police Chief Robert Wasserman and OfficersWilliam Veteran, Chris Alberti and John Anderson. Besides assault and battery,the suit accuses the officers of false arrest.;   According to the suit, thebrothers were having a peaceful Thanksgiving with family and friends whenofficers arrived at their home about 5 p.m. and told them to lower the music.Though no one spoke English, the officers used hand signals that the brotherssaid they eventually understood. They obliged by turning down the music.;   Anhour later, the suit says, the officers returned and grabbed Paulino. He brokefree, claiming he didn't know what has happening. When Paulino attempted toquestion officers, the lawsuit alleges, they began severely beating him withtheir batons. Meanwhile, Raul became frightened and ran toward the house when,he said, the officers started hitting him.;   &quot;They were singled out for abusebecause they were minorities and couldn't speak English,&quot; said attorney PaulNoboa, who is representing Raul Deleon. &quot;They (plaintiffs) had troubleunderstanding what was going on, tried to ask for an explanation and insteadwere clubbed.;   &quot;The problem in this case is that Fremont police sends outpeople to remedy the problem and they don't even speak their dialect.&quot;;  According to police records, officers warned the Deleons about the loud musicafter receiving a complaint from a neighbor. An hour later, they were calledto the home of the complaining neighbor, who told police that Paulino Deleonhad slapped and threatened him.;   Officers then went to the Deleon home andtold Paulino the neighbor wanted him arrested for slapping him. As theofficers started to search Paulino, he reportedly became belligerent, lungingat the officers, ignoring their orders and forcing them to use their batons.;  Three others, including Raul Deleon, were taken into custody. But Raul wasreleased and never charged because officers later determined he wasn'tdirectly involved in the altercation.;   Wasserman, who hadn't yet seen thelawsuit, declined to discuss the case.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SANDRA GONZALES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  457  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 28, 199100333115,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
