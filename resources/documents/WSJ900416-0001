Now even the traditionally cautious pension plans aregetting into the act.   Vulture funds, which feed on the securities of companiesthat are in or near bankruptcy-law proceedings, have longattracted money from wealthy people, insurers and Wall Streetpartners investing for their own accounts. More recently,endowments such as Yale University's and the RockefellerFoundation have been buyers. And now the $40 billion GeneralMotors Corp. pension fund has invested. So has InternationalPaper Co.'s $2.2 billion pension fund.</LP><TEXT>   At Warner-Lambert Co., &quot;We foresaw there would be a lot ofproblems with leveraged buy-outs and felt there would be abig supply&quot; of troubled securities, says Fred G. Weiss, headof the $1.3 billion pension fund. Distressed securities --such as bonds and bank loans on which a company has missedinterest payments, as well as those of concerns inbankruptcy-law proceedings, among other problems -- hadchalked up an &quot;outstanding track record,&quot; he says, so thepharmaceutical company put $10 million into a vulture fundlast year.   Batus Inc., the U.S. arm of Britain's B.A.T IndustriesPLC, also has allocated $10 million to the field, convincedthat &quot;a lot of LBOs would disintegrate over time,&quot; saysThomas J. Hartlage, director of Batus's pension fund.   Most vulture managers won't buy a stake in a distressedsecurity unless they can expect to make 30% a year, says MaryAnn Johnson, president of New Canaan, Conn.-based TremontPartners Inc., which is organizing a bankruptcy fund to bemanaged by several vulture firms.   These expected returns can be reduced by failures andunexpectedly long waits before receiving payouts. Vultureinvestors usually &quot;will get something between 18% and 25%{annual return}, and that's extremely attractive,&quot; she says.   Yet the influx of vulture players may reduce profitopportunities, some investors say. &quot;You've seen some of italready,&quot; Warner-Lambert's Mr. Weiss says. &quot;There are anincreasing number of players in this, and some of the dealsare being priced more steeply than they would otherwise.&quot;   Indeed, some skeptics believe that by the time pensionfunds target an area for investment, many of the bestopportunities are gone. &quot;That should tell you that this isthe top of the market,&quot; says Peter Langerman, executive vicepresident of Short Hills, N.J.-based Mutual Series Fund Inc.,which does some bankruptcy investing. Attracting pensionfunds' interest, he says, &quot;is like being on the cover ofSports Illustrated. It's a jinx.&quot;   With the appetite of institutions whetted because of thehigh returns, relative to traditional investing, the air isfull of vulture-fund operators trying to attract investors.Twenty separate groups have raised a total of $1.07 billionfor funds and partnerships investing in turnaround situationsand troubled securities; they and others are trying to raisealmost $1 billion more, according to a recent tally byBuyouts, a Needham, Mass., newsletter.   Hundreds of millions of dollars more have been allocatedto distressed securities by investment firms and moneymanagers such as New York-based Magten Asset Management Inc.that don't operate special funds.   &quot;Most of the investment banks are building up a tradingcapability in this area or a turnaround advisory group orboth,&quot; says George Putnam III, publisher of Boston-basedBankruptcy DataSource, which tracks companies inbankruptcy-law proceedings. &quot;This is one of the few growthareas on Wall Street.&quot;   But while interest in vulture investing is running at anall-time high, it is still a drop in the bucket, comparedwith other specialized investing areas such as venturecapital. Vulture investing &quot;is growing, but my sense is thatthe amount of money seeking troubled securities isn't growingnearly as fast as the supply of troubled securities,&quot; Mr.Putnam says.   Indeed, despite expectations of a rising number ofdistressed securities from high-yield, below-investment-grade&quot;junk&quot; bond casualties -- and still more opportunities if theeconomy swings into recession -- vulture investing is likelyto make up only a tiny part of even the most adventuresomeinstitutional portfolios. Many pension funds are barred fromholding bankrupt securities or even those rated belowinvestment grade.   The mere mention of the term bankruptcy scares otherinvestors, large and small. &quot;We don't use the wordbankruptcies; we always say reorganizations,&quot; says Norman G.Herbert, investment officer for the University of Michiganendowment, which has allocated a total of $10 million tothree vulture funds. One reason for his emphasis: Companiesin bankruptcy-law proceedings can be hurt by cash squeezesbut often have adequate assets to pay their debts, he says.   Nevertheless, there is no escaping the high risks ofvulture investing. Carefully negotiated restructurings canblow apart at any time. Assets listed on the books may benowhere to be found. Legal proceedings are unpredictable andcan drag on for years before investors get paid for theirholdings.   Veteran vultures say they are taking all this intoaccount. &quot;What determines risk is the price of a security,&quot;says David Breazzano, portfolio manager of the BaltimorebasedT. Rowe Price Recovery Fund. International Business MachinesCorp., now trading at about 107, &quot;to me is a very risky stockat $200 a share, but at $50 a share, there isn't a lot ofrisk. What it all boils down to is that if you're buying itat a price below the asset values of the issuer, you'reprobably pretty safe.&quot;   Timing also can be critical. Just after Eastern Airlinesentered bankruptcy-law proceedings a year ago, Mr. Breazzanosays, he paid between 40 and 60 cents for each dollar faceamount of some Eastern debt issues. Four months later, hesold them for about 80 cents on the dollar, despite thepotential for further gains, as the airline was promising topay creditors in full.   But those plans collapsed and the Eastern debt issues nowsell for less than 20 cents on the dollar. Because of thepledge to pay creditors in full, &quot;The people we sold tothought they were taking less risk, but they got blindsided,&quot;Mr. Breazzano says, adding: &quot;You can get hammered.&quot;   Vultures fall into two camps, depending on whether theytry to gain control of the companies in which they invest.Control-type vultures buy large enough chunks of a company sothey can install their own management team, expecting toprofit by shaping up the troubled company's operations. Suchintensive work usually limits these vultures to only a fewinvestments at a time.   So-called portfolio vultures go in for a larger number ofsmaller investments. They don't want control, though they maybecome company directors or members of creditor committees,often taking turns in assuming the lead role to stretch theirmanpower. Some are even more passive, shunning any insiderrole in bankruptcy-law proceedings that could limit theirtrading freedom.   Some vultures have junk-bond backgrounds, but veterans saythe investing techniques for the two areas are verydifferent. Junk-bond holders expect to receive interest andprincipal payments on time, while vultures know not to counton either. Instead, vultures have to be expert in legalproceedings, because their profit will depend on the outcomeof the reorganization.   Fairfield, Conn.-based Common Fund, which invests moneyfor more than 600 college endowments, considered buying junkbonds for the first time last year, but instead put $50million in bankrupt securities. Fund President George Keanesays he is enthusiastic about the results so far, which&quot;suggest there are better returns at lower risk with bankruptsecurities than junk bonds.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
