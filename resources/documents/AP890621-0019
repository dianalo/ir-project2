Those states and New York each now have more than 1 millionHispanics, the bureau said in its first detailed analysis ofminority populations since the 1980 census.   Sixteen states, led by New York, had more than 1 million blacksas of 1985, while California had the most Hispanics and otherminorities, the study found.   Blacks comprise the nation's largest minority at 28.9 million,the study reported. New York had the largest black population at 2.7million, followed by California with 2.1 million blacks.   But the black population of California was growing faster, adding243,000 between 1980 and 1985, compared to a 219,000 increase forthe Empire State.   The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in 1980to 17.5 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth ratesand international migration. Although they were only 6.3 percent ofthe U.S. population in 1980, Hispanics made up about one-fourth ofthe 12 million national population increase during the nexthalf-decade, the report said.   California has the largest Hispanic population, the reportshowed, at 5.9 million _ one-third of all Hispanics in the nation.   Texas was second at 3.7 million followed by New York at 1.9million and Florida with 1.1 million.   California added 1.3 million Hispanics between 1980 and 1985,while Texas gained 700,000. Florida, New York and Illinois alsoadded more than 100,000 Hispanics each.   Among states with a million or more blacks the fastest growthrate for that group, 16 percent, was posted by Florida.   Mississippi had the largest proportion of blacks in itspopulation, 36 percent, the report found, followed by SouthCarolina, 31 percent, and Louisiana, 30 percent.   During the first half of this decade only West Virginia and theDistrict of Columbia had a decline in black population.   More than four out of five blacks reside in metropolitan areas,the bureau found. And the shift continued to be in favor of citieswith blacks migrating out of rural southern regions and into urbanareas.   The report added that four metropolitan areas have more than 1million black residents _ New York (3.2 million), Chicago (1.6million), Los Angeles (1.2 million) and Philadelphia (1.1 million).   Almost 90 percent of all Hispanics live in metropolitan areas,with more than half in seven metro areas, the study found _ LosAngeles (3.6 million), New York (2.3 million), Miami (815,000), SanFrancisco (775,000), Chicago (757,000), Houston (595,000) and SanAntonio (568,000).   The nation also included 7.3 million other minorities, a categorythat includes Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Eskimosand Aleuts. This group jumped 1.9 million over five years, largely aresult of international migration.   With 2.3 million, California was the leader in this category,followed by Hawaii, 692,000, and New York, 516,000.   Texas, Virginia and New Jersey had the fastest growingpopulations in this group, however. Texas' other races increased 67percent to 314,600 while the group was up 52 percent to 126,800 inVirginia and 51 percent to 184,000 in New Jersey.</TEXT></DOC>
