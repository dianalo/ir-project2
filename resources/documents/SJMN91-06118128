But what isnot being shown on the world's television screens is the plight of the growingcadre of children elsewhere who are being killed, tortured and abused far fromthe camera's eye.;    In Rwanda, they are called saligomans, &quot;nasty kids&quot;; inPeru, pajaros fruteros, or &quot;fruit birds,&quot; earning their name by snatchingproduce from market stalls. Elsewhere they are considered hooligans, juveniledelinquents or simply &quot;brown dust.&quot;;    These are the 30 million children whospend their days and nights living and working on the streets of the world'spoorest cities.;    By any name, street kids are among the most neglectedpeople on Earth. They not only suffer the depredations of hunger, disease andcold, but also are spurned by polite society, beaten by police andincreasingly tortured -- even murdered -- by death squads bent on clearing thestreets of &quot;pests.&quot;;    Across the Third World, and particularly in LatinAmerica, their number is growing. Yet even estimating their ranks is tricky.&quot;Who bothers to count non-people?&quot; one children's advocate observed.;    Inthe streets these children, both boys and girls, quickly become survivalartists. By night, they huddle together to keep warm. By day, they shineshoes, guard cars or beg. When all else fails, they steal from market stalls,snatch mirrors from cars or sell their bodies for money or a meal.;    Many ofthem turn to drugs: A 40-cent bag of shoe cement buys a day's worth of escape.From Bogota to Bombay, street kids sniff glue, gasoline or paint thinner todull the hunger and deaden the pain.;    Yet society's attitude toward themoften is more punitive than protective.;    &quot;Street kids are seen as a sourceof instability rather than as a product of it,&quot; said Peter Dalglish, executivedirector of the Canadian-based Street Kids International.;    Clandestinevigilante groups recently have taken this &quot;blaming the victim&quot; to a horrifyingextreme. Long bedeviled by the hostility of merchants and police, some streetkids in Colombia, Guatemala and Brazil now fear for their lives.;    OneColombian death squad, calling itself Death to Street Children, has said itaims to &quot;clean up the streets of the Colombian capital.&quot; At least 20 youthswere shot to death there last year, most of them in a city park where theylived, according to Amnesty International.;    The Brazilian Institute ofSocial and Economic Analysis, meanwhile, has evidence of more than 450child-slaying incidents in Brazil's big coastal cities in recent years.Guatemala City has lost some 40 street kids this year to a purge believedperpetrated by agents of the National Police.;    Social upheavals; Throughout the world, street urchins are a symptom of a social fabricunraveling. In Latin America especially, increased concentration of landownership has accompanied policies that favor urban areas. As a result,immigrants from depressed rural areas have eagerly sought the &quot;opportunities&quot;of the city.;    But urbanization and mounting debt have overwhelmed thecapacity of Third World nations to provide jobs and services. With nowhere togo and little opportunity for employment, many parents send their children tothe streets.;    In Recife, Brazil, children begging or selling fruit atcrowded intersections typically earn two to three times what their parents doas unskilled laborers.;    At first, working children maintain family ties andeven attend school. But as poverty deepens, so does pressure on the child.Parents become taskmasters who abuse or lock out children who fail to bringhome enough cash.;    As home becomes less a source of comfort or support,children spend more time away. Eventually, many break all ties, preferring theindependence and camaraderie of the streets to violence and conflict at home.;   In extreme cases, some parents even sell their children's bodies inexchange for something to eat. In Thailand, where an estimated 40,000 childrenunder age 14 are involved in prostitution, brothel owners offer the equivalentof a poor farmer's yearly earnings for a young, nubile girl.;    Now, AIDS isdestined to swell dramatically the ranks of street kids in Africa and otherimpoverished areas. UNICEF's senior adviser on AIDS, Elizabeth Prebble,predicts that the disease will leave 3 million to 5 million uninfectedchildren orphaned within the decade in 10 central African countries -- alongwith hundreds of thousands of infected children who will die from AIDS beforetheir 5th birthday.;    In the past, Africa's strong sense of communityprovided a safety net for abandoned children. But, Prebble notes, &quot;Africanfamilies who would have unquestionably taken in orphans a few years ago may bemore reluctant to do so in this era when AIDS and the general economic crisisare already stretching family resources to the limit.&quot;;    Until recently, thestandard approach for those who cared was to institutionalize street kids injuvenile homes. Too commonly, these are houses of detention that undercutchildren's self-sufficiency while meeting few of their needs for emotionalsupport. Moreover, these homes are invariably too expensive to assist morethan a small number.;    According to the Rev. Arnold Grol, a Dutch missionarywho founded the Undugu program for street kids in Nairobi, juvenile homes arejust another form of charity. &quot;The trouble with most aid programs,&quot; Grol says,&quot;is that they make people dependent. We have to grant them autonomy if wereally want to help.&quot;;    Grol and other children's advocates are designingprograms that approach street kids in the vacant lots and back alleys wherethey live. These programs encourage self-sufficiency and work to give childrenbasic skills, both social and technical, to help them survive in today's ThirdWorld cities.;    Help in Bogota;  At Bogota's Bosconia-La Florida project,street children can drop in for the occasional hot meal, take advantage ofclasses or join &quot;La Florida,&quot; the project's self-governing residentialcommunity of 500 ex-street kids. Here children work, go to school and receivetechnical training.;    In Khartoum, another program is simultaneously meetingstreet kids' need for income and business's need for quick day-to-daycommunication in a city plagued with phone failures and slow mail. Under acourier service called Street Kids Inc., boys work as bicycle messengers inthe afternoon after attending informal classes in the morning.;    More thanfood and shelter; &quot;The kids learn the importance of showing up for work ontime, and how to apply for a job,&quot; says Peter Dalglish, who founded theprogram in 1987. &quot;But most importantly, it helps them to develop theself-respect and confidence they so sorely need.&quot;;    For every child suchprograms reach, millions go unattended. And the problem is too large to beleft to a handful of activists, no matter how dedicated.;    UNICEF's WorldSummit for Children last year was a symbolic nod in this direction. Amid muchfanfare, leaders from more than 70 nations agreed to a plan of action thatwould drastically improve the lives of children. So far, though, there hasbeen little follow-up.;    In the final analysis, the responsibility forstreet kids falls to adults, who are still inclined to see street children asa nuisance and a threat. In fact, they are victims -- as helpless as the Kurdswhose faces we now know all too well.;    As Nobel Prize winning Chilean poetGabriela Mistral puts it: &quot;We are guilty of many errors and many faults, butour worst crime is abandoning the children, neglecting the fountain of life.Many of the things we need can wait. The child cannot.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LORI HEISE, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910427  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,382  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 27, 199100118128,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
