Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration is beset by anew wave of militancy by unions, ranging from local governmentworkers and dock workers to firefighters at London's HeathrowAirport.   The executive committee of the National Union of Railwaymen metMonday and rejected a management offer of an 8.8 percent payincrease and said Tuesday's planned 24-hour strike, the union'sfifth one-day stoppage in five weeks, will be held.   The 24-hour stoppages have brought the national rail network to ahalt on each occasion.   ``The British Rail board's offer of an 8.8 percent increase inbasic pay is unacceptable. The effect of that is that the strikefrom midnight (Monday) is on,'' the union's general secretary, JimmyKnapp, told reporters.   The union is seeking a 10 percent raise for its 75,000 members.The board, which runs the state-owned railroads, initially offered 7percent but then increased that to 8.8 percent.   Knapp said the issue of low pay would not be solved by theboard's latest offer.   Rail employees are among Britain's lowest paid industrialworkers. Average earnings, including overtime, amount to theequivalent of $471 a week for train drivers and $325 for the others.   Earlier Monday, leaders of the train crews' union, the17,500-member Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers andFiremen, accepted British Rail's 8.8 percent pay increase offer andcalled off their ban on rest-day and overtime work.   Scores of London's famous red double-decker buses were off theroads Monday as a 24-hour strike by maintenance engineers stoppedthem leaving their depots.   The stoppage over pay could be extended to Tuesday to coincidewith a planned walkout by 10,500 London subway workers _ their 11thone-day stoppage in 15 weeks.   About 10,000 parking spaces will again be made available Tuesdayat two royal parks in central London, Hyde Park and Regent's Park.Many commuters have already booked hotels and taxis and somecompanies have hired coaches.   Buckingham Palace said it canceled a royal carriage processionTuesday for United Arab Emirates President Sheik Zayed Bin SultanAl-Nahyan, which would have closed some of the capital's busiestroads, ``in view of the uncertainties about traffic congestion.''   The president will travel by car from Heathrow Airport to QueenElizabeth II's residence at the start of his four-day official visit.   Eighty firefighters at Heathrow were discussing a strike thatcould close the world's busiest international airport next week. Theairport has rejected their claim for a 20 percent pay increase.   ``The airport has to have fire cover for operations, sopotentially operations could shut down if there was a strike,'' amanagement spokesman said.   Britain's inflation rate has risen sharply in the last year to8.3 percent, the highest in the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity.   A three-day strike over pay by 500,000 white collar workersemployed in public services by city halls throughout Britain was setto start at midnight Monday, the third walkout in three weeks.   The city hall strikes stop care services for children and theelderly, shut slaughterhouses as meat inspectors are not availableand close local tax offices, museums and libraries.   On the seventh day of a national dock strike at 60 of thecountry's 162 ports, dockworkers' leaders from Belgium, France andWest Germany said they would urge 38,000 dockworkers not to handlecargo from strike-bound ports.   The 1.4 million-member Transport and General Workers Union,Britain's largest labor union, organized the strike in support ofdemands that port employers maintain national bargaining after theabolition of a government system guaranteeing dockworkers' jobswhether they had cargo to handle or not.</TEXT></DOC>
