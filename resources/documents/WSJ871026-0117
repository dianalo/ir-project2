In a letter late last week to the drug's marketer, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., the FDA urged that the ads be discontinued. The company is the East Hanover, N.J.-based unit of Sandoz Ltd., of Basel, Switzerland.    The full-page ads, which ran Sept. 16 and Sept. 23 in the New York Times, Washington Post, U.S.A. Today and other papers across the nation, were the first drug promotions in the general press to mention a prescription drug by name and give detailed prescribing information that traditionally is provided only to doctors. Some drug-industry marketers said when the ads appeared that they could encourage other drug companies to produce similar direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns.    But the FDA letter's harsh tone is expected to damp such marketing moves. One FDA official with knowledge of the affair said he was &quot;surprised by the letter and its blunt manner.&quot; He said, &quot;(The letter) appears to be a statement by some at the agency that they don't like these sorts of ads and don't want to see them in the future.&quot; response, Sandoz said it had run the ads only after first seeking clearance from the FDA. Moreover, the company said it thought its claims were appropriate. An industry executive close to the company said Sandoz officials were &quot;confused&quot; by the agency's latest response in light of the earlier approval.    In the letter, FDA official Peter Rheinstein acknowledges that the company had been given &quot;preclearance.&quot; But Dr. Rheinstein said the agency's drug-advertising branch wasn't aware that some statements in the ad had been rejected as unproven by the FDA's medical-reviewing division.    The letter said the company had failed to convince the agency that it &quot;caused a lower rate of drowsiness than other antihistamines.&quot; The agency also criticized Sandoz for claiming in its ads that the drug is more effective than other antihistamines. Indeed, the letter said there is evidence from other studies that Tavist &quot;is in fact less effective than one of its major competitors.&quot;    Sandoz said the ads were placed as a promotion to doctors and weren't designed as a promotion to the public. Industry marketers challenged this, saying the ads were an effort to counter a marketing campaign by Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Dow Chemical Co., for its prescription drug Seldane.    Merrell-Dow has approval from the FDA to market that drug as causing significantly less drowsiness than other antihistamines, and it has an overwhelmingly large share of the anti-allergy market even though it went on sale in 1985, eight years after Tavist. Merrell-Dow has run a series of ads on television and in the print media stating that doctors can treat allergies without causing drowsiness, but those ads never mention Seldane by name. The FDA said it views those types of ads as &quot;public service&quot; promotions. </TEXT></DOC>
