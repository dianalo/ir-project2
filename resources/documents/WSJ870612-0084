But few have the troubles of the European Community.    Each day, the group struggles to conduct business in its hodgepodge of nine official languages. Things are so bad that the EC dedicates 60% of its administrative budget to translation.    To bridge these linguistic barriers, the EC has turned to the wonders of technology -- and has begun to supplement the work of human translators with machines capable of producing raw translations in about 10 minutes.    But the machine translators illustrate the troubles Europeans have with technology. While Europeans have been quick to use the new machines -- and have been among the leaders in researching the field -- they haven't yet demonstrated the knack of bringing commercial products to market.    The use of machines to translate human languages took off in the mid-1970s, especially in Europe, where 700 million people speak more than 30 languages and devote 57% of their international trade to dealing with each other.    The market for commercial products seems vast: It includes both multinationals wanting quick document translation and small translation companies needing rapidly translated first drafts. Such systems can help publishing houses and newspapers cut proofreading costs by checking spelling and grammar.    The systems can provide a framework for teaching languages too, as the West German electronics concern Siemens AG has found in its computer-aided Valerie program. By creating specialized dictionaries in technical fields, companies can use translation machines to teach technicians to read English.    Machine translation had a slow start, partly because of bad press early in its development. A 1966 National Science Foundation report in the U.S. was so negative that many machine-translation companies died.    Many computer experts blame the linguists who dominated the field and were more interested in the intricacies of language than the practicalities of word processing. Another problem has been the technology's reluctant users -- language translators -- who have been the fiercest of gatekeepers.    Loll Rollings, chief of the EC's multilingual program, says fighting the balkiness of EC translators has been hard: &quot;They say: 'We get our salary whether we produce six pages a day by human translation or whether we produce 25 by machine,'&quot; he contends.    On their side, translators say that while the machines may be all right for translating the language of bureaucracy, they don't do well when used on more active prose. &quot;Oratory is out because it is on the warm end of the emotional scale,&quot; says Andrew Evans of the EC's English translation division. And stay away from the &quot;icy chill of legal text or anything of an unequivocal nature&quot; when using machine translation, he adds.    Today's leaders in the multibillion-dollar machine-translation market are Automated Language Processing Systems (ALPS), Provo, Utah; Logos, Wellesley, Mass., and Weidner, Northbrook, Ill. Japanese companies such as NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Bravice International also are moving aggressively into the market.    Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. and NEC are working on vocal translation methods that would allow executives calling long distance and speaking two different languages to have the other's language translated almost instantaneously into their own.    The system the EC uses, Systran, was the first translation machine on the market. Introduced in 1970, it's still the fastest system, but that speed comes at the expense of precision. &quot;Systran is very tolerant with wrong sentences,&quot; says Thomas Pahl, a expert on Systran based in Hennef, West Germany. &quot;In fact, it doesn't even notice.&quot;    Other systems, such as ALPS, are interactive, allowing computers to ask the translator to help them when they're puzzled. These systems often produce slower but smoother translations.    All machine-translation systems have trouble with homographs -- words that have the same spelling but different meanings. Ian Pigott, the program director for the EC's Systran, says translation machines typically take a French verb phrase such as &quot;nous avions&quot; -- we had -- and translate it into English as &quot;we airplanes.&quot; The mix-up comes, says Mr. Pigott, because &quot;the machine hadn't been able to envisage the plural of planes being a verb as well.&quot;    Many of these homographic blunders have been cleared up by upgrading and correcting the system's dictionaries. But dictionary inaccuracies persist.    When the EC was asked not long ago to do development work for the French aircraft corporation Aerospatiale, a Systran user, it found outdated words in its terminology banks that would have spawned low-quality translations. The word &quot;engine&quot; was listed as &quot;moteur,&quot; the French word for an old-fashioned propeller engine, rather than as &quot;reacteur,&quot; which means &quot;jet engine.&quot;    Experts say systems such as Systran are best suited for technicians and other specialists looking for information, not polished prose.    At the West German nuclear research center at Karlsruhe, machine translation has been used to boost cooperation with nuclear scientists in France.    The machines translate documents from German into English and from French into English so that both groups of scientists can read them. Raw translations using Systran are processed at a rate of about 1,000 pages an hour, says F.W.A. Habermann, head of the facility's translation department. That's more than 100 times faster than by human translators, he says.    In Europe, the keen interest in machine translation reflects persistent linguistic barriers that become trade barriers. Though most businessmen on the continent do the bulk of their trading within the Common Market, they frequently can't speak their neighbors' language. They usually sidestep the problem by speaking English together.    But when two European companies enter cooperative ventures, language is a barrier to collaboration: Executives often can't read tenders, patents and other documentation in the partner's language. &quot;First Europe has to solve its own trade difficulties before we can move successfully in world markets,&quot; says Mr. Rollings.    Given these ambitions, it would seem that Europe would lead the way in machine-translation technology. But though it is arguably the largest market for machine translation, it lags the U.S. and Japan in this technology. Mr. Pahl, who runs his own software company, says the problem is a chronically European one: translating immense interest into commercial projects. &quot;We experience the problem here that exists in the general area of high-tech development in Europe,&quot; he says. &quot;Europeans are generally too conservative. In the States you have an idea and you just try it. Here you spend days and days talking about the potential problems that could arise.&quot;    Despite his skepticism, Mr. Pahl calls European collaboration an ideal motive for further use. &quot;If you have an Italian partner, you don't care if the German coming out of his Italian research reports is a very nice German,&quot; he says. &quot;What's important is that you can understand it.&quot;    ---   Ms. Pope is a staff reporter in the Bonn bureau of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
