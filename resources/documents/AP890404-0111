Daley should inherit his father's job. Democratsfought to retain a House seat in Alabama.   In Winnetka, Ill., residents voted on a non-binding handgun banprompted by a shooting spree at a local elementary school last May.A woman carrying three handguns killed an 8-year-old boy andwounded several others before committing suicide.   And just outside Kansas City, two white supremacists wereseeking local offices in a bitter contest in Northmoor, Mo.   Besides Chicago, cities where voters were choosing mayorsincluded St. Louis, Madison, Wis., and Wichita, Kan. In Omaha,Neb., seven mayoral candidates ran in a primary election to picktwo finalists for the May 9 general election.   Kansas City, Mo., voters considered whether to strengthen thepower of their mayor's office.   The only statewide race pitted an incumbent state Supreme Courtjustice in Wisconsin against an appeals court judge who accused herof being soft on crime.   A Democrat was favored to win the Alabama congressional seatleft vacant by the death of Democratic Rep. Bill Nichols. Secretaryof State Glen Browder was considered the frontrunner in arough-and-tumble race against Republican state Sen. John Rice forthe 3rd District seat in the House.   In Chicago, Daley, a Democrat and the son of the late MayorRichard J. Daley, led in pre-election polls against independentcandidate Timothy Evans and Republican Edward Vrdolyak. They werevying to fill the last two years of the late Mayor HaroldWashington's term.</TEXT><TEXT>   Race was the underlying issue in Chicago, where elections tendto divide voters by color more than party. Daley, 46, the CookCounty state's attorney, captured overwhelming white support in theFebruary Democratic primary to oust the city's second black mayor,Eugene Sawyer.   Sawyer had been appointed acting mayor following Washington'sdeath in November 1987. His chief rival at the time had been Evans,a fellow black Democratic alderman who later formed the HaroldWashington Party.   Sawyer was supported in the primary election by Jesse Jackson, aChicagoan who casts a long shadow in local elections. Jackson thenabandoned the Democratic nominee _ Daley _ to endorse Evans, 45, inthe general election.   Vrdolyak, 51, was the wild card in the race. The formerDemocratic alderman had been Washington's arch-foe but has beenunable to win elective office since switching to the RepublicanParty in 1987.   Although the Chicago race occasionally lived up to the city'sfeisty political tradition, it was tame compared to thebare-knuckle Alabama congressional race.   Browder, 46, a former political science professor, adopted aget-tough strategy to counter Rice's liberal-bashing. Rice, 37, areal estate developer, had labeled Browder a liberal, a liar and a``wimp.''   Browder, casting aside his image as a mild-mannered reformer,castigated Rice as an ``off-the-wall radical'' and ran televisionadvertisements showing the Republican as a hand-grenade threateningto blast funds to the elderly in half.   The Alabama race was one of three special congressionalelections this spring. In Indiana, Democrat Jill Long defeatedRepublican Dan Heath last week in a race to fill a vacant seat onceheld by Vice President Dan Quayle. Voters in Wyoming will choose asuccessor to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on April 26.</TEXT></DOC>
