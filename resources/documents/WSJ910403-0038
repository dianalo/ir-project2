The plan would insulate roughly 250,000 policyholders ofthe life insurance company from the real estate problems ofthe holding company, according to Ronald Freres, chieffinancial officer. The plan has yet to be approved by stateinsurance regulators and its bank group, led by ChaseManhattan Bank.</LP><TEXT>   Banks are generally prohibited from owning insurancecompanies except in a satisfaction of debt. Regulators wouldeventually require the bank to sell the life insurancecompany.   The restructuring will eventually lead to a sale of thelife insurance company by the bank group, Mr. Freres said.&quot;Right now, representatives of the banks, the life company,the Massachusetts Insurance Department and potential buyersare meeting,&quot; he said. Proceeds from a possible sale would beused to repay $235 million in debt owed to the banks.Creditors that are owed $70 million to $80 million in realestate debt would also likely be give a stake in the lifeinsurance unit.   Monarch, based in Springfield, Mass., which has beenstruggling for months to work out a restructuring plan withits creditors, had the second large loss by a major insuranceholding company in as many days. Yesterday, First ExecutiveCorp., based in Los Angeles, reported a net loss of $465.9million, mainly the result of junk bond problems.   Monarch Capital's problems surfaced last fall when it tooka $103 million pretax charge for anticipated losses on realestate assets and reported a $67.8 million loss for the thirdquarter. Shortly after that, it announced that it had entereda standstill agreement with its banks on $235 million indefaulted bank debt. Since then, it has been extending theagreement on a monthly basis while it restructured itstroubled real estate portfolio and negotiated with lenders.   The fourth quarter loss includes a $106 million charge byMonarch Capital resulting from its split from the lifeinsurance unit. The results also included a $128 million losson a reinsurance agreement during the fourth quarter withMerrill Lynch. Under the agreement, Merrill bought most ofthe company's variable life insurance business, which hadhelped propel Monarch's fast growth in the mid 1980's.   Monarch Life, which reported a $227 million loss for theyear, also took a $79 million loss on a loan to the parentcompany, made through an unusual arrangement called the &quot;cashmanagement account.&quot; The insurance unit reported stockholdersequity of $253.6 million and statutory surplus of $99.6million. For the year, its total capital, including surplusand reserves, fell $47 million.   For the year, losses of Monarch Capital totaled $520.9million. Its assets currently total $206 million and itsliabilities total $412 million, he said. All of the holdingcompany's debt would be extinguished under the restructuringplan, however, he said.   The holding company will continue to operate after thelife insurance unit is turned over to the banks as a vehicleto liquidate the company's real estate operations, he said.It will also continue to hold its Hudson Valley FinancialServices subsidiary, which markets life insurance tocustomers of banks, including Chase Manhattan Bank, he said.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          MONARCH CAPITAL Corp.'s Hudson Valley Financial Servicesunit markets life insurance to customers of ManufacturersHanover Trust.
