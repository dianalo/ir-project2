Pressure on the dollar mounted further in New York trading after Market News Service Inc., a specialized wire service primarily serving the currency and bond markets, reported that the White House is &quot;content to let the (dollar) fall to whatever level the market determines.&quot; The report was attributed to a senior Reagan administration official, who wasn't identified.    The dollar was boosted initially yesterday by a continuation of Tuesday's rally that was spurred by central bank intervention. The Bank of Japan continued to buy dollars in the Tokyo market yesterday.    The dollar also climbed Tuesday and early yesterday on rumors that the West German Bundesbank would cut its discount rate today. Such a move would widen the gap between U.S. interest rates and the lower West German rates and thus increase the appeal of dollar-denominated investments.    Although there was continued expectation of a rate cut in some quarters, the dollar came under selling pressure as traders interpreted some news reports from West Germany as casting doubt on that prospect.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, for instance, said &quot;a series of questions&quot; on basic issues still must be answered before the Group of Seven industrialized nations could schedule a meeting.    That suggested to some market participants that economic cooperation between the U.S. and West Germany isn't strong enough yet for the Bundesbank to follow through with a rate cut. The U.S. is pressing West Germany to stimulate its economy as a means of spurring world economic growth and consumption of U.S. exports.    It also was reported that Mr. Stoltenberg won't attend today's meeting of the West German central bank council and that no news conference will be held after the meeting. Some traders said those developments appeared to make it less likely that a rate-cut decision will be made.    &quot;It basically plays into the speculation that we're leaning to now, that the West Germans will do nothing,&quot; Bernd Becker, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer for Austria's Osterreichische Landerbank AG in New York, said. &quot;I believe a rate cut is a little further away.&quot;    A West German economic-stimulus package that was announced yesterday had little impact on the currency markets. The package, which will provide about $12.7 billion of loans at subsidized interest rates over the next three years for domestic investment, contained no surprises, traders said.    The news service report about White House willingness to see a lower dollar, which came during the New York trading day, supported the view of many dealers that the Reagan administration is letting the dollar decline to put pressure on its allies to stimulate their economies.    A weaker U.S. currency tends to hurt other nations' exporters by making their goods more expensive for U.S. consumers. Hubert Pedroli, foreign exchange manager at Credit Suisse First Boston's New York office, said the administration's lack of public comment on the dollar's recent dive leads him also to conclude that the U.S. is &quot;content to see it weaken.&quot; He said the market now &quot;assumes the U.S. wants the dollar lower.&quot;    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.6458 West German marks, down 0.6% from 1.6558 Tuesday. The dollar also fell 0.7% to 132.51 Japanese yen from 133.38.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.30 an ounce to $488.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    The dollar was quoted at 132.45 yen in early Tokyo trading Thursday.    Gold was quoted at $488.95 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.
