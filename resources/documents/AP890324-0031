Rebels meanwhile destroyed a bridge on the main highway linkingKabul to the strategic eastern city of Jalalabad, the governmentsaid Thursday.   The anti-government forces have pressed in on Jalalabad in aneffort to bring about a quick demise of Kabul's Marxist governmentin the wake of the Soviet troop withdrawal.   The Afghan capital is surrounded by rebels trying to oust thegovernment of President Najib, and convoys carrying supplies intothis city of 2.25 million people are occassionally attacked ordelayed.   The Indian supplies were flown in Thursday, said the spokesman,who cannot be identified under briefing rules. Another shipment ofnine tons of supplies is being readied, the spokesman said todayfrom New Delhi.   The Indian government announced earlier this month that it wouldprovide humanitarian and economic assistance to Afghanistan.   India is the only non-Soviet bloc nation that maintainedrelations with Kabul after the Soviet Union intervene militarily in1979 to prop up its client regime in Afghanistan.   The last Red Army soldiers left Afghanistan on Feb. 15 as part ofa U.N.-sponsored peace accord.   Blowing up the bridge could signal a renewal of guerrilla tacticsrather than direct battle in the 18-day battle for Jalalabad. Theguerrillas have found it difficult to confront an army with airpower and long-range missiles.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani told reportersThursday that the bridge near Sarobi, midway between Kabul andJalalabad, was destroyed by explosives planted on the span. He saidthe bridge was one of about 100 on the paved highway.   He said three other roads, all unpaved and more circuitous,remain open to military convoys between Kabul and the city, which is75 miles to the east near the Khyber Pass.   Moslem insurgents, who are based in Pakistan and also backed bythe United States, launched their offensive on the eastern city onMarch 6. But they have not succeeded in dislodging government troops.   Soviet troops completed their withdrawal last month after morethan nine years of intervention in a civil war that began with acommunist coup in April 1978. The Soviets continue providingmilitary supplies to Kabul's government.   Amani said the guerrillas fired 2,000 rockets and artilleryshells at government positions outside Jalalabad in the previous 24hours.   No government forces were killed, but five soldiers and fivecivilians were wounded, he said. He said 89 guerrillas, includingfour local commanders, were killed in the same period.   Soviet-made Scud-B rockets have been fired daily from Kabultoward Jalalabad since the battle began, according to foreignobservers and residents of Kabul. They have a range of at least 175miles.   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze saidPakistan had grossly violated the U.N.-mediated agreement byallowing the rebels to form an interim government on its territory.They hope the government will soon take power.   Shevardnadze also charged arms were being delivered to the rebelsfrom the United States via Pakistan in violation of the accord.   He said many Soviet civilian specialists remain in Kabul as wellas the staff of a large embassy. ``Any attempts to encroach upontheir security will draw a most resolute Soviet response,'' he saidThursday without elaboration.   Reports on casualties and fighting around Jalalabad areimpossible to verify from Kabul. Guerrilla headquarters in Pakistanhave reported far lower death tolls for the mujahedeen than thegovernment.   Thousands more Afghans have fled recently to Pakistan to avoidthe fighting, swelling a refugee population estimated at 3.5million. About 2 million other refugees are in Iran.   Guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24-hourcurfew on Jalalabad to avert an exodus. Insurgent leaders said theywere reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualtiesit would cause.</TEXT></DOC>
