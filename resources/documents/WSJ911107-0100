The final day of the three-day hearing ended in surprisewhen the congressional committee allowed that critic, CharlesHamel -- the impetus for the proceeding -- to make astatement and then go unquestioned.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're disappointed,&quot; said Marnie Isaacs, spokeswoman forAlyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil group, based in Alaska.&quot;Many of the questions raised over the last few days shouldhave been addressed -- was he in possession of stolendocuments and did the committee receive those stolendocuments from him?&quot;   Rep. George Miller, chairman of the committee responsiblefor oversight of the oil industry in Alaska, had called thehearings to ascertain whether the surveillance operation,ordered by Alyeska and conducted by the security concernWackenhut Corp., interfered with Mr. Hamel's role as acongressional witness and whether Mr. Miller and othercongressmen had become targets of the Wackenhut probe.   It was unclear how long it would take for the committee toreach a conclusion on its findings, but it won't be for atleast two weeks, the time allotted for inclusion of anyadditional statements into the record. And although thecommittee hasn't any enforcement powers, it can makerecommendations based on those findings to the U.S. JusticeDepartment and state agencies.   Ms. Isaacs said the industry would wait for thecommittee's findings before taking any action. Oil industryexecutives testified that Mr. Hamel possessed documents theyallege were stolen from Alyeska, and they intimated at thehearings that Rep. Miller and others might be guilty as wellif Mr. Hamel had passed those documents on to them. Alyeska,in its quest to plug leaks, ordered handwriting analyses onemployees suspected of passing on documents, according to aninternal memo distributed during the hearing.   One of his attorneys, G.P. Hardy, said that informationMr. Hamel received was either in the form of photocopies orfacsimiles. &quot;And courts have ruled that xeroxed documentsaren't stolen,&quot; he said.   If Mr. Hamel had been questioned the hearing could havedeteriorated into a free-for-all involving allegations ofenvironmental wrongdoing by Alyeska as well as blowing openthe whole issue of how to handle whistle-blowers who aretrying to bring to light industry malfeasance. &quot;We wanted tostick to the focus . . . Hamel had no control over theWackenhut operation so there was very little he could haveadded,&quot; Rep. Miller said.</TEXT></DOC>
