Sherman, chairman ofthe telecommunications department at the University of Georgia.;   &quot;What thecable business was lacking in the mid-'70s was programming to drive themachine,&quot; Sherman said. &quot;Cable had been around since the 1950s, retransmittingbroadcast signals, but it needed its own impetus, and Ted Turner providedthat.&quot;;   Now cable can be found in 60 percent of the U.S. households with TVsets, up from 15.1 percent in the month before TBS was launched, according tothe National Cable Television Association.;   TBS is the fourth most widelycarried cable network. It's available to 58 million U.S. households,representing 98 percent of cable homes and 60 percent of television homes,according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission byTurner Broadcasting System Inc.;   Only ESPN, with 59 million households, CNN,which has 59 million households and is also owned by Turner Broadcasting, andUSA, with 58 million households, have greater potential viewership, accordingto the cable TV association.;   TBS, called WTCG until 1979, went on the airwith a wide, familiar mix of 24-hour programming. Over the years the lineuphas included movies, reruns of &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot; and Atlanta Bravesbaseball games.;   That variety gave people more reason to turn on cable TV.It also encouraged the start-up of several other nationwide channels, notablyESPN, Nickelodeon and C-Span, which were on the air within three years.;   TheSuperstation's success also gave Turner Broadcasting the foundation to launchCable News Network, Headline News, Turner Network Television and the regionalSportSouth.;   &quot;It's one of the greatest stations ever put on cable,&quot; saidHarold Freeman, owner of Troy Cable Inc. of Troy, Ala., one of the originalsystems to carry TBS.;   &quot;If he hadn't started the ball rolling, put it thisway: I had a 12-channel system, and we had trouble getting enough channels tofill it up,&quot; Freeman said. &quot;Now we've got 58 channels running.&quot;;   Today theTBS schedule remains anchored by such standby reruns as the &quot;BeverlyHillbillies&quot; and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show,&quot; though Turner's acquisition of theMGM and Warner Bros. film library has vastly expanded the roster of movietitles.;   The Atlanta Braves, which Turner bought in 1976, also call TBStheir television home, as do the stars of World Championship Wrestling.;   Butthe station also recognizes that viewers can watch &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; only somany times. So TBS recently began packaging its programming, Segal said.;  For instance, the station tried to capitalize on the theatrical release of the&quot;Addams Family&quot; movie last month by bunching several episodes of the old TVseries into a festival. This month, TBS has gathered holiday episodes ofvarious sitcoms into a Christmas rerun festival.;   TBS has maintained itsstanding among the top four cable stations by carrying a broad variety ofshows, said Sherman.;   Advertising, the station's chief form of revenue,brought in $276.3 million in 1990, up 2 percent from $271.1 million in 1989.;  &quot;It's still the jewel in the crown from the advertisers' standpoint becausethe demographics are so broad,&quot; Sherman said.; Top networks; Here are the top10 cable television networks, as ranked by the National Cable TelevisionAssociation. The name of the network is followed by the number ofsubscribers.; 1. ESPN, 59.1 million.; 2. CNN, 58.9 million.; 3. USA, 58.0million.; 4. TBS, 57.7 million.; 5.
