(products).andO;Product:   CatchWord (Computer graphics software).andO;Topic:     Optical Character Recognition SoftwareScanningEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Based on Inovatic's recognition algorithm, Logitech's $199 CatchWord can turnany Logitech hand scanner into an inexpensive-albeit not terriblyaccurate-OCR system.andP;  In addition to straight vertical strip scanning, theprogram can rotate and recognize horizontal scans and recognize and merge twovertical halves of an 8.5- by 11-inch page.andM;After scanning in a text image (which is saved in an internal file thatcannot be recalled by the user), the program runs the &quot;prerecognition&quot;module, in which it breaks the image into &quot;models&quot;-the bitmap patterns thatthe program tries to match to perform recognition.andP;  Next, the software jumpsinto the recognition module, which gives you the opportunity to input thecorrect characters based on the model displayed on screen.andP;  (You can bypassthe interactive steps.) The final module allows you to correct any incorrectmodels; for instance, if CatchWord consistently thought an &quot;s&quot; were a &quot;5,&quot;you'd rectify that error here.andM;CatchWord's basic text editor can perform search and replace and blockoperations.andP;  Once you've saved the text file, the program can convert it tovarious generations of some popular word processor formats, as well ascomma-delimited ASCII.andP;  Word processor conversion basically consists ofattaching proper header information to a file.andP;  CatchWord preserves indentsas well.andM;Although it performs equally well on common serif and sans serif fonts,CatchWord's error rate is relatively high.andP;  Out of a representative 138-wordtext sample, 23 models went unrecognized and 4 were misrecognized.andP;  Most ofthe recognition problems were ligatures such as &quot;ff.&quot; I also foundrecognition for most type sizes to be a bit better at 400 dots per inch thanat 300 dpi.andM;CatchWord's interface is simple to use-people with knowledge of OCR canprobably get started without the manual-but has some inconveniences.andP;  Forinstance, in the revise models screen, you see only four lines of text,making it difficult to tell the difference between an occasional recognitionerror and an incorrect model.andM;Using the hand scanner remains the weakest link in the process.andP;  Forinstance, impatient hands can send you back to the drawing board time andtime again.andP;  And you usually have to fiddle with the contrast for eachpassage you scan.andM;The software's high error rate may be unacceptable if you plan to use it torecognize large text passages.andP;  But if you're an occasional user and workwith brief selections and already own one of Logitech's hand scanners,CatchWord provides an inexpensive OCR solution.andP;  * List Price: CatchWord,$199.andP;  Requires: Logitech ScanMan, 450K free RAM (500K recommended), harddisk drive, DOS 3.0 or later, graphics adapter.andP;  Logitech inc., 6505 KaiserDr., Fremont, CA 94555; (800) 231-7717, (415) 795-8500.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
