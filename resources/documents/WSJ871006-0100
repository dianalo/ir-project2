They each have their own stove and sink. The kitchen also sports a $2,800 Subzero brand refrigerator, a dish-warming drawer and a butler's pantry. &quot;It's a dream kitchen,&quot; says Mr. Wellman, an avid cook.    The kitchen's significance extends well beyond its 12-by-16-foot dimensions. Mr. Wellman is vice president for corporate planning at K mart Corp., and his plunge into the kitchen helped convince him that K mart should launch a major offensive in housewares, including everything from kitchen gadgets to decorative bath towels. That's why K mart recently hired Martha Stewart -- Connecticut caterer to the rich and famous, and author of lavish bestselling books on cooking and home entertaining -- as its &quot;life-style spokesperson and consultant.&quot;    In the coming months, K mart will launch a Martha Stewart media blitz, with television commercials, print advertising, displays in its 2,200 stores and perhaps even a television special on holiday entertaining. &quot;By Jan. 1 it will be almost impossible for 76 million households not to be aware of the name Martha Stewart,&quot; Mr. Wellman declares. &quot;We'll make her the next Betty Crocker, only she's a real, live person.&quot; (Betty Crocker is the fictional character created by General Mills Inc.)    Big changes are under way at K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer (after Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.) Since the chain was launched 25 years ago, it built its sales and reputation on just one thing -- low prices. To many consumers that also meant unfashionable merchandise. Other retailers already have proved that the two needn't go hand in hand -- notably Crate andamp; Barrel, a 24-store chain offering trendy housewares, and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Lechmere home-goods chain. Now K mart wants to follow, on a far larger scale.    K mart going upscale? Perish the thought. &quot;Upscale implies that you want to go after customers who aren't shopping in your stores at the expense of the ones who are,&quot; says Mr. Wellman. &quot;And that isn't true.&quot;    Instead, K mart will &quot;move from being a low-price item merchant to being a category merchant,&quot; says Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive officer. In other words, K mart wants to establish certain categories -- such as kitchen and home goods -- in which consumers already think of it as a good place to buy. In those categories it will offer a range of goods, from its traditional bargain-basement fare to items with higher quality and fashion, and higher prices as well.    The new thrust first became evident two years ago, when K mart hired former &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; star Jaclyn Smith to endorse a new line of women's wear designed to shed the &quot;polyester palace&quot; image of K mart apparel. In its first year, the Jaclyn Smith line reaped $100 million of sales -- without reducing sales of K mart's other women's clothes.    More recently, K mart moved to boost its position in sporting goods, which, along with auto parts, is a category where it already holds a big market share. The company signed on to sponsor a major golf tournament (the Greater Greensboro Open in North Carolina), as well as the Winter Olympics in Calgary and the summer games in Seoul.    Mr. Antonini, who is 46 and just got the chairman's job last month, is the driving force behind all this. But the man he's asking to implement it is Mr. Wellman, who is in charge of his &quot;ad hoc committee&quot; to identify &quot;life-style&quot; trends and figure out how K mart can cash in on them. The committee settled on &quot;cocooning,&quot; which used to be called hanging around the house.    The 47-year-old Mr. Wellman is a 23-year K mart veteran. A Detroit native and University of Michigan graduate, his Troy home is just three minutes from K mart's headquarters. Besides cooking and home entertaining, he likes to shop. He regularly strolls through the J.C. Penney store at the Oakland Mall near his home to check on the competition.    Mr. Wellman also shops at K mart. He says he's the &quot;first to admit&quot; he doesn't buy everything there, but he does pick up shirts, sweaters, and an occasional necktie. &quot;This is a knockoff of the Hermes tie,&quot; he said recently while browsing at a Detroit area K mart. &quot;It's 100% silk, but it costs $6 instead of $60. So if you're unfortunate enough to spill soup on it, you just throw it away.&quot; When he isn't cooking or shopping Mr. Wellman likes to watch television, which makes him a natural cocooner.    &quot;There's a lot of media hype about cocooning,&quot; Mr. Wellman says. &quot;People have been coming home, playing with the kids and watching TV for years. But the people doing it now have the money to go out, if they wanted to. Instead, they're spending those dollars on their home.&quot;    But they aren't spending enough of them at K mart. And that's where Martha Stewart comes in. K mart figures that with the Stewart cachet on its kitchen and home goods, people who once scorned its stores will take a second look and decide, says Mr. Wellman, &quot;that our merchandise is tasteful and good quality.&quot;    But there's a potential problem. Is the K mart shopper the type to pay attention to &quot;Entertaining,&quot; Ms. Stewart's first book, for instructions on throwing the &quot;Neoclassic Dinner for Eight to Ten?&quot; (The menu includes artichokes smothered with tomatoes and herbs, roast leg of lamb with garlic-guava glaze, carrot puree and gooseberry mousse.)    K mart already has passed the potentially tricky hurdle of bringing Ms. Stewart on board. &quot;We were leery that she'd say she would only represent Bloomingdale's,&quot; Mr. Wellman says, &quot;but she immediately understood the ramifications.&quot; Those are, Ms. Stewart explains, &quot;the opportunity to bring the messages in my books to the masses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
