Copperand nickel oxide from the corrosion of feedwater train and reheater copperalloy tubes are particularly aggressive steam generator corrodants. Transportof these aggressive oxides can be reduced by replacing copper alloy heatexchanger tubes with all ferrous alloys. The required changes and associatedcosts for replacing the copper alloy heat exchanger tubes are given.6 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
