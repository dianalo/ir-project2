According to exchange sources, part of the floor is likely to be turned into a central &quot;certification facility&quot; for transactions among member firms.    Under plans, brokers could bring transactions to the facility, which would be connected electronically to registrars of stocks throughout Britain. The exchange is promising a three-day settlement for non-urgent trades, though it would also offer a one-day and two-hour service for more urgent transactions, for a fee that hasn't been disclosed yet.    Return of activity to the floor would be an ironic twist. The sweeping deregulation of the London market last year led much of the trading to leave the floor. Most of the exchange's daily volume currently is traded by telephone or electronically through brokers' screens.    Electronic trading, in turn, has allowed volume to rise, which in turn has exacerbated the problems with Britain's understaffed, antiquated back rooms.    A stock exchange statement said that detailed planning for the certification service is under way and that it is expected to be launched in the next few weeks.    Separately, the stock exchange denied a report that it has assembled a published &quot;league table&quot; of firms with the highest number of unsettled transactions.    One of the brokerage firms mentioned in the news report, Phillips andamp; Drew, acknowledged that in value terms, it would be &quot;quite high up&quot; in a list of firms with unsettled trades. However, C. Hugh Eaves, the firm's finance director, says that its trading volume &quot;has increased considerably in institutional business&quot; and that its unsettled trades equal just two days' turnover.    An exchange spokeswoman, meanwhile, said the backroom backlog showed a &quot;small but significant decrease&quot; in the latest reporting period. She said she couldn't disclose any figures. The exchange has set a deadline of Friday for member firms to show progress in settling long-outstanding transactions or face penalties including possible fines. </TEXT></DOC>
