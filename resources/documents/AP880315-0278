The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Chicago,also names the Options Clearing Corp., which processes allsecurities options trades in the nation.   The investment partnership, Mandamp;M, sued on behalf of the more than1,000 customers it said traded in excess of $40 million worth of aNovember series of stock options on the Standard andamp; Poor's 100 stockindex.   The investors contend the exchange violated its rules by nothalting trade in stock index options in a more timely fashion.   It said the exchange operated a ``fraud and deceit upon theplaintiffs'' by failing to maintain a fair and equitable market.   Exchange spokesman Warren Moulds said it ``won't comment onpending litigation.''   George Hender, executive vice president of the clearingcorporation, said he couldn't comment because he had not seen thelawsuit.   The lawsuit contends that on the morning of Oct. 20, the dayafter the crash, Mandamp;M put in an order to buy November put options.   A put option gives the buyer the right to sell stock indexcontracts at a set price before the expiration date.   The system in use at the exchange requires that opening tradesbe rotated among the various contracts, and that free tradingbegins only when the rotation is completed, the lawsuit said.   The average length of the opening rotation is 12 to 15 minutes,it said, but in the hectic aftermath of Black Monday, openingrotation took 2 hours and 30 minutes.   By the time Mandamp;M's contracts were executed, prices ``werearbitrarily high and grossly inflated,'' the lawsuit contends.   ``Once they placed that order, they couldn't withdraw it,'' saidattorney Leigh R. Lasky, who represents Mandamp;M. ``They were lockedin.''   The lawsuit contends that for the investors to have broken even,the Dow Jones Industrial Average would have had to plunge anadditional 50 percent by Nov. 20, the expiration date of theoptions.   Mandamp;M invested $23,400 and lost 90 percent of it, Lasky saidTuesday. The class of investors, which had put up more than $40million, probably lost close to 90 percent, too, he said.   The lawsuit asks that the investors be reimbursed.</TEXT></DOC>
