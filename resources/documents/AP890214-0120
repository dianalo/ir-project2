WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, beginning a personaltour of inner cities, visited poor Atlanta neighborhoods Tuesday andsaid he wants to create ``dramatic incentives'' that will bring jobsand housing to blighted urban areas.   ``There is distress and despair in many of the areas of theeconomy that have been left behind, and that's where I definitelywant to focus my attention,'' Kemp said.   One day after being formally sworn in as secretary of housing andurban development at a ceremony with President Bush, Kemp flew toAtlanta for a two-day visit to poor neighborhoods.   He said the trip was the first of a series of visits to majorcities ``to help find answers to the problems of homelessness,housing and urban economic development.''   Kemp met with the city's black, Democratic leaders, Mayor AndrewYoung and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., toured the museum honoring MartinLuther King Jr., and scheduled a private dinner with the late civilrights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King.   Kemp received a warm welcome as he heard more than 20 communityleaders but was also told the needs are too great for privateefforts to work without government help.   ``A lot of people have a lot of hope for you,'' said MillardFuller, a leader of the Habitat for Humanity group that builds homesfor low-income people without federal help. ``There's a lot of goodfeeling for you. I hope you live up to the expectations.''   Kemp's meetings were emblematic of the former congressman andunsuccessful Republican presidential candidate's stated intention toseek innovative solutions for inner-city problems regardless of thesource and of national Republican intentions to seek support amongblacks.   ``This is an opportunity, after my swearing in yesterday, to cometo a city where lots of things are happening to help people get inhomes, jobs, shelter,'' Kemp said.   Young led Kemp through a series of public housing projects andother developments where private groups, some with and some withoutgovernment assistance, built homes and apartments for rental orpurchase by low-income people.   His visit had the feel of a campaign day as he went fromneighborhood to neighborhood in a motorcade with police escort, withone bus filled with the press and another with local officials andsupporters.   Kemp visited the nation's first public housing project, Techwood,built in 1936, as well as neighborhoods such as Cabbagetown, BedfordPine and Vine City where redevelopment projects are underway orplanned.   Much of the housing was in good shape, newly constructed orrenovated. Kemp was not taken to Bankhead Courts, a public housingproject that has received widespread attention for its crime andother problems, but Young said that the areas the secretary didvisit had problems that were ``identical.''   ``We're not trying to hide the fact we have many, many housingproblems,'' Young said.   He said that on Wednesday Kemp would meet with groups arranged byMrs. King and see other areas with worse problems.   Kemp used the visit to repeat his pledge to seek theestablishment of urban enterprise zones that carry federal taxincentives designed to attract businesses and jobs. Kemp said theincentives could include breaks on capital gains for qualifiedinvestments, with the tax breaks contingent on hiring people whootherwise would be receiving welfare or other assistance.   Some of the projects he visited were built through the localequivalent of enterprise zones _ local abatements or forgiveness ofproperty taxes that encouraged development.   ``We've got to do it at the federal level because only thefederal government can provide dramatic incentives,'' Kemp said.   Kemp repeatedly referred to ``reincentivizing'' the economythrough such tax breaks, and said enterprise zones would``greenline'' urban areas that have been hurt by ``redlining'' _ aterm for lending practices that deny capital for development tocertain areas.   ``Areas that were at one time redlined for despair need to begreenlined for success,'' Kemp said.</TEXT></DOC>
