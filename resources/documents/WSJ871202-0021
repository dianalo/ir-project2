The radar system, known as Nexrad, for Next Generation Weather Radar, is a joint program by the agency, which is part of the Commerce, Transportation and Defense departments. It will provide the National Weather Service, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force Weather Service with more timely and detailed information on hazardous weather and floods.    The network is expected to be completed in 1994 or 1995.    Detroit-based Unisys defeated a bid by Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass., in winning the contract. The Unisys Shipboard andamp; Ground Systems Group of Great Neck, N.Y., will do the work.    Rep. James Scheuer (D., N.Y.), who has been pushing the Reagan administration to move ahead on procurement of the Nexrad system, hailed the contract award, saying it would &quot;move our nation's weather forecasting technology out of the Dark Ages and into the 21st century.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
