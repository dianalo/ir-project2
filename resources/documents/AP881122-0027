They recommended closing all insolventSandamp;Ls within two years.   The General Accounting Office, in one of a series of transitionreports addressed to the next administration and Congress, made amore urgent appeal: ``The time has come to move as quickly aspossible to close insolvent institutions.''   Nearly 500 of the nation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls are insolvent. Another 400don't meet federal capital standards and are considered weak.Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the mess range from $50 billionto $100 billion.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has ``resolved'' 146 cases sofar this year, but only 26 of them by closing the institution. Mostof the rest have been rescued. The government has provided cash andguarantees against future loss to entice private investors andhealthy Sandamp;Ls into taking over failed institutions.   GAO analyst Craig Simmons said his agency was not against allmergers, but said so far the bank board hasn't had the money torecognize all the losses and is covering them with open-endedguarantees.   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, defended the currentpractice. He said selling too much of the property from failed Sandamp;Lstoo fast could drag down the value of property held by healthyinstitutions, further debilitating economically troubled regions.   ``It would be devastating if we were to do wholesale liquidationsin a state like Texas,'' he said, adding, ``There are places in thecountry where wholesale closings would result in no services to acommunity.''   However, the GAO argued that keeping failed Sandamp;Ls open has in thepast ``simply delayed the inevitable while adding to the eventualcosts.''   But, it said, closing insolvent thrifts ``means fully recognizingand finding the money to pay for the losses in those institutions _money that FSLIC (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) doesnot have today.''   It said the problem was too large for the industry to bear aloneand said the ``depositing public'' must help, either through anappropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge.   The two former presidents said the industry must continue to payfor the cleanup of ailing institutions, but they acknowledged, ``thenext president and Congress (also) must go to the taxpayers.''   Delay is dangerous, the former presidents said, because ``asudden development or unexpected crisis _ such as a stock marketcrash or an increase in interest or inflation rates _ could triggera wholesale flight of depositors.''   ``The effect on the U.S. economy and on the world economy couldbe devastating,'' they said.   In recommendations to avoid a repeat of the problem, Carter andFord said the FSLIC should be administratively merged with the fundfor commercial banks under a common regulatory board, a move opposedby the Sandamp;L industry.   The GAO called for ``fundamental changes'' in the regulation ofSandamp;Ls, citing ``the schizophrenic position of the Federal Home LoanBank Board as both an industry advocate and safety and soundnessregulator.''   It recommend consideration of merging the commercial bank and Sandamp;Lregulatory systems, but did not endorse the idea.   Simmons said the GAO believed a sweeping reform of depositinsurance, which guarantees accounts in banks and Sandamp;Ls up to$100,000, was not needed immediately and could delay the resolutionof the crisis. Instead, the agency suggested experimenting withseveral reforms.   One, called risk-based deposit insurance, would charge higherpremiums to banks that make risky investments. Another, known as anarrow bank proposal, would restrict Sandamp;Ls to investing deposits innearly risk-free areas such as government securities.</TEXT></DOC>
