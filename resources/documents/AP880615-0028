By a vote of 230-170, the lawmakers on Tuesday stripped from agovernment spending bill a proposed 4 percent hike in pay forthemselves and other top government officials. They left in placethe boost in salaries for other federal workers.   The House then voted 301-96 for the overall bill, a $16.1billion spending package for the Treasury, Postal Service, theExecutive Office of the President and other federal agencies. Themeasure now goes to the Senate.   Members of Congress now make $89,500 and the bill would have letthat automatically increase by 4 percent next January along withthe rest of the federal work force.   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., offered the amendment to block theraises for lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, Cabinet officers andother federal officials at the top of the pay scale.   Crane said Congress didn't deserve more pay, especially givenits dismal record in reducing federal deficits.   ``I think ... based upon performance we should not becontemplating such pay raises'' just a little over a year sinceCongress' last boost, he said. He suggested that lawmakers considerputting themselves on a ``commission basis'' as an incentive toreduce federal red ink, although that was not part of hislegislative proposal.   Several members defended the increases as needed to attract toppeople to government.   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said he'd want the voters to throw himout of office if they didn't think he deserved the same payincrease as other federal employees.   ``It's image. It's political posturing,'' Hoyer said of theamendment.   The pay raise issue dominated Tuesday's debate, but thepresident's Office of Management and Budget said other problemswith the bill were the ones likely to provoke a veto.   OMB said the House was failing to provide money to cover the payboosts, twice what the president recommended, for the bulk of thefederal work force. The agency said Congress should have cutspending to offset the increases, instead of waiting for additionalfederal spending later.   The bill also contains $417 million in postal subsidies opposedby the White House, and some federal construction projects forwhich OMB said Congress had not properly accounted for the cost.   Across the Capitol, the Senate voted 78-18 to approve a $1.8billion bill covering congressional operations in the coming fiscalyear.   The measure, a $22 million increase over this year's spending,covers the current salaries and expenses of lawmakers andcongressional employees, and the costs of upkeep and protection forthe buildings where they work.   The Senate did not address the issue of pay raises for membersof Congress and other top government officials in this measure.   The House passed a similar version of that bill last month. Afew minor differences will have to be worked out by negotiatorsfrom the two chambers before the bill can be sent to the president.</TEXT></DOC>
