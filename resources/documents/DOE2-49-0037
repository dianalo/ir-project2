The characteristic signal which is hypointenseto the brain can be obtained only if deoxygenated intact red cells areconcentrated within a retracted blood clot. The authors conclude thatblood may not be specifically identified by MR if imaging is done whileunclotted blood is accumulating or if fibrinolytic enzymes in cerebrospinalfluid and/or dura rapidly lyse the blood clot. In addition, diseasesor medications which prevent retracted clot formation may interfere withthe specificity of MR in detecting acute hemorrhage.</TEXT></DOC>
