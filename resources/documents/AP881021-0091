The weekly Ash-Shiraa said the hostages would be freed to ensurevictory for Vice President George Bush in exchange for a commitmentfrom the Republican candidate to rearm Iran after he takes office.   There was no way to verify the report.   Ash-Shiraa, which has access to Iranian hardliners, gainedinternational fame when it broke the story of the secret U.S. armssales to Iran in November 1986. But its subsequent reports aboutthe hostages, including reports of an imminent release, provedinaccurate.   Other reports have said both Bush and Democrat candidate MichaelDukakis sent envoys to work out a deal with Iran on the hostages.But Washington has denied any contact was under way with Iran.   The nine Americans are among 14 foreign hostages in Lebanon,most believed held by Shiite Moslem radicals linked to Iran. Thelongest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Ash-Shiraa said: ``A new deal has been in the works for a whilebetween the United States and Iran under which Iran would free theAmerican hostages held by its factions in Lebanon before theupcoming American elections to ensure the victory of the Republicancandidate, Vice President George Bush.   ``In return, Bush will undertake to forge a new policy in theregion, making Iran its main cornerstone after Israel as the casewas during the era of the (late) Shah (Mohammed Reza Pahlavi).   ``The scenario also requires Iran to recover its military mightwith particular support from the U.S. and the West in general sothat it will be able to go back to war (against Iraq) as soon aspossible to score battlefield victories that would redeem theprestige of the Iranian army.''   After a series of battlefield defeats, Iran in July accepted aU.N. cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
