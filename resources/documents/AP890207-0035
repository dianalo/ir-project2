(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A shy 19-year-old who lived in a trailerwith five other people is charged with killing two roommates andsuspected in four other slayings in what police say could be WestVirginia's biggest killing spree.   Mark Southern McCallister, whose trailer was found with dead ormalnourished animals, has confessed to killing the two roommates buthas not said why, according to authorities.   Investigators said they are looking for a motive and evidence topin the four other deaths to McCallister. A grand jury began hearingevidence this week.   ``Right now, everything in that case is being looked at,'' saidKanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes.   McCallister is charged with killing brothers Billy and OtisSanson. Also slain were their sister, Bonnie Sanson; her boyfriend,Jimmy Price; her former boyfriend, James Schillings; andMcCallister's grandmother, Charlotte Ruby Ferrell.   Ferrell, 69, was found dead in her home; the other bodies werefound near a three-trailer compound behind the St. Albans MooseLodge.   All were killed by a close-range shotgun blast to the head.   Since he was 16, McCallister spent much time at the 12-foot-widetrailer with the Sanson brothers; the Sansons' mother, CarolRutherford; and Rutherford's daughter, 8-year-old Tammy, and hergranddaughter, 2-year-old Victoria Pauley.   The Rutherfords and Sansons took McCallister in after he had anargument with his parents. But late last year, some family memberssay domestic quarrels began at the trailer.   Mrs. Rutherford, 46, has moved away and won't talk to reporters.Access to McCallister has been denied by defense attorneys andprosecutors.   The Sanson brothers were shot Jan. 8. The four others were foundlater.   Otis, 25, shot in the back and left in a camper trailer, wasfound covered with cushions, said assistant prosecutor ReaganWhitmyer.   Billy, 27, shot in face, was left in the chicken-wire dog pen, amakeshift contraption littered with rusted coffee cans.   After McCallister was arrested, the search intensified for fourpeople who had been reported missing. Three of the missing lived inthe trailer compound.   McCallister's grandmother was found in the bedroom of her St.Albans home Jan. 13, shot in the head at close range and wrapped insheets and a curtain, authorities said.   The door to the house had been padlocked from the outside;McCallister had a key, Whitmyer said.   All three bodies were found the same way: nude from the waistdown but somehow wrapped or covered.   On Jan. 21, police began searching the area around the trailercompound and within 1{ weeks found three more bodies.   Ms. Sanson, 19, was found buried on the grounds of an abandonedmotel across U.S. 60 from the trailers. Price, 22, and Schillings,20, were found shot in a nearby junkyard. All three appeared to havebeen dead for quite some time.   The local animal shelter received complaints about trailer, andon Nov. 10 officials picked up 10 dogs that were starved for foodand attention, said Sylvia Shaffer of the county animal shelter.   After the Sansons' bodies were found, more animals were picked upat the trailer _ six dogs, two cats, goldfish, two turtles, arabbit, a white rat, a dead kitten, a dead puppy and a deadmockingbird.   McCallister colored his natural red hair black after policesought him for questioning on Jan. 10, acquaintances said.   ``I remember that day,'' said David Smith, who runs a body shopnear the trailers. ``I saw him walking by and had commented on hishair being nice and shiny and black.''   It was not unusual to see McCallister walking in the area.   ``He used to skip school and hang around here bummingcigarettes,'' Smith recalled. ``I'd give him a couple of dollars tosweep up the parking lot.''   Neighbors remember McCallister as quiet, kind of shy and alwayslooking for money.   ``I knew him for two to four months. He would help clean uparound the place,'' said Jerry Norman of the Moose Lodge. ``I wouldtell my janitor if he ever needed help to go back there and get himand give him $10 for helping.''   Greg Perdew said McCallister used to sit on the porch and count``a big stack of food stamps,'' and he often wondered whereMcCallister had obtained them. Prosecutors said Schillings' and Ms.Sanson's food stamps continued to arrive at the trailers after theydisappeared.   West Virginia's worst mass killings occurred in 1932, when HarryPowers admitted killing five people and was hanged. Historians sayPowers killed two women and three children in a garage called ``thechamber of horrors'' and buried his victims in a ditch.</TEXT></DOC>
