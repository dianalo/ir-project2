A technical system for the circulation ofhighly saliniferous hotwater has been tested for the first time in Bruchsal.The conditions for a long distance heat supply are favourable. On thebasis of the results gained at Bruchsal a development of geothermal reservoirswith a high temperature yield can now be envisaged. Tests showed thatthe reinjection system used at Bruchsal can be utilized on a commerciallevel.</TEXT></DOC>
