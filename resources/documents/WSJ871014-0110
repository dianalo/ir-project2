President and Chief Executive Officer Laurence A. Tisch favors spinning off part or all of the company's record unit rather than selling it to Sony Corp. of Japan, individuals close to Mr. Tisch said.    Directors of the broadcasting and records concern are scheduled to meet this morning to consider whether to sell CBS Records to Sony, which has offered $2 billion for the unit, or to spin it off in a transaction that would be tax-free to CBS. They also could decide to keep the unit.    Mr. Tisch is said to favor the spinoff in light of the estimated $600 million tax liability CBS would incur by selling the record operation to Sony.    A CBS spokeswoman declined to comment. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, CBS shares closed at $218.25, up $7.    Mr. Tisch's recommendation on which course to take will be critical to the board's decision. Mr. Tisch also is chairman of Loews Corp., a New York-based insurance, hotel and tobacco concern that controls 25% of CBS shares. As previously reported, CBS officials have said he wants to get CBS out of the record business in part because of the industry's volatile earnings record.    CBS Chairman William S. Paley, who controls an 8% CBS stake, also is leaning toward a spinoff, an associate of Mr. Paley said. Mr. Paley sees a partial spinoff, for example, as a way for CBS to retain at least some interest in the record business, which CBS has been involved in for 50 years. Directors may find it difficult to override support for a spinoff from the CBS's two most powerful shareholders, company officials noted.    CBS risks harming its relationship with Sony if the Japanese company's latest offer is rejected, one CBS official said. Among other things, CBS could jeopardize its joint venture with Sony, CBS-Sony, a Japanese record operation.    Last year, CBS turned down a $1.25 billion offer for the records operation from Sony and Walter Yetnikoff, president of the unit.    Sony reportedly wants the unit mainly to complement its strong consumer electronics business. Sony officials are unhappy with the prospect that their latest bid might fail, one CBS executive said. </TEXT></DOC>
