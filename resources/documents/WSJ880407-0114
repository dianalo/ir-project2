With the Dow Jones Industrials finishing the day up 64.16 points, both defenders and critics of program trading claimed victory. &quot;I was all set up for this,&quot; said a major New York practitioner of program trading, who said he &quot;chuckled&quot; when the curbs were announced. But a New York Stock Exchange spokesman insisted that the restrictions &quot;have been working.&quot;    Under an exchange rule enacted Feb. 4, member firms are restricted in carrying out a form of program trading known as index arbitrage on any day that the Dow industrials move more than 50 points. Specifically, the firms aren't allowed to use a high-speed order execution system known as SuperDot.    Index arbitrage involves shuffling money between stocks and stock-index futures, buying whichever is cheaper and selling the other. Defenders say it helps keep stock and futures prices in line; critics worry that it can contribute to market volatility. Either way, index arbitrage generates a blizzard of buy and sell orders -- often for 300 or more different stocks -- which must be executed rapidly.    Yesterday was the first time since Feb. 4 that the Dow industrials crossed the 50-point threshold. So at 3:32 p.m. EDT, the Big Board announced that automated systems were off limits to index arbitragers.    Traders said several securities firms, led by Salomon Inc., simply switched their method of doing index arbitrage. &quot;They just substituted screaming brokers with a handful of orders&quot; for machine-generated trading slips, said a floor broker. &quot;It made things slightly less efficient, but they could still do the trades.&quot; Salomon officials didn't return phone calls for comment.    One index arbitrager said he was able to do several $30 million trades after 3:30 p.m., buying stocks and selling futures to lock in about a 7% annualized return. &quot;It's a nuisance to write tickets, but it can be done,&quot; he added.    William Marcus, a futures expert at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said ordinarily he would have expected June-expiration futures on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index to trade about 1.43 points above the index itself. But as bullish sentiment spread through the markets yesterday, the Sandamp;P futures often traded at a higher premium, reflecting their greater leverage. Thus, index arbitragers bought stocks and sold futures, capitalizing on the price disparity.    Of more significance than index arbitrage, Mr. Marcus said, was the presence of &quot;real buyers to continue the rally,&quot; as investors perceived better economic news yesterday. The June Sandamp;P futures finished at 267.40, up 7.90 on the day and nearly 2 points above the Sandamp;P index itself, which closed at 265.49.    Even one of program trading's sharpest critics, Robert Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co., spoke well yesterday of the Big Board's rather limited restrictions. &quot;The way it's worked, it's a wonderful idea,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
