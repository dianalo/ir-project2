(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northwest Airlines has on order up to 100Airbus A320 jetliners like the one that crashed during ademonstration flight in France, a company official said.   The twin-engine Air France aircraft crashed in a forest at theend of an airfield in eastern France near the Swiss border. Threepassengers were killed and 50 others were injured.   ``I doubt (the crash) would have an impact on our decision topurchase from Airbus,'' Alan Muncaster, a spokesman for Northwest,said Sunday. ``But obviously we would want to check into the causeof the crash.''   Northwest, based in this St. Paul suburb, and Airbus announcedin October 1986 that Northwest would buy up to 100 Airbus A320sfrom its manufacturer, Airbus Industrie, in a deal that would beworth $3.2 billion.   Pan American World Airways has ordered 16 A230s, with an optionto buy 34 more. In addition, two U.S. leasing companies haveordered the A320. GATX Air has ordered 10 and International LeaseFinance Corp. has three on order.   A spokesman for Airbus Industrie said there were indicationsthat human error caused Sunday's crash, but the president of theairline's pilot's union said its engines may have failed to restartat the pilot's command.   The jet went into service in April for Air France and BritishAirways, and last Thursday, Air France took delivery of the planethat crashed.   The Airbus A320 is the first civilian airliner equipped with afully computerized flight-control system, which the manufacturersays permits safer, electronically controlled flight.   The aircraft carries 168 people and consumes 40 percent lessfuel than similar two or three engine jets.   The Northwest agreement calls for delivery of up to 100A320-200s between 1990 and 1995. Northwest must make a firmcommitment on 10 A320s for delivery in 1990 and 1991.   The Toulouse, France-based Airbus Industrie consortium says ithas more than 500 orders or letters of intent to buy the A320.France, Britain, West Germany and Spain are partners in Airbus.</TEXT></DOC>
