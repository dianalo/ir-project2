Measurements have been carriedout by a Ge(Li) detector and the ND-6620 data acquisition and processingsystem, with 6 days of cooling time for uranium and 20 days for thorium.The results were compared to those obtained by delayed neutron analysisthat was considered to be the most sensitive method. ENAA results werefound better than those obtained by instrumental NAA. The validity ofthe measurements for uranium as well as for three thorium ore samples:S-14, S-15 and S-16, with a high Th/U ratio and high rare earth content,was checked by an IAEA intercomparison.</TEXT></DOC>
