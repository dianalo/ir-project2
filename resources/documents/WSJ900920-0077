As thesaying goes, the voters are mad as hell, and aren't going totake it anymore.   We suspect the anti-establishment vote just recorded inMassachusetts is going to get most of the attention, but fora more revealing look at what may lie ahead, check outOklahoma. Oklahoma has become the first state to vote tolimit the terms of its state legislators.</LP><TEXT>   Oklahoma's term-limitation initiative won more than 67% ofthe vote, carrying every one of the state's 77 counties andall demographic groups. It made the difference in thecome-from-behind victory of businessman David Walters in theDemocratic primary for Governor. Mr. Walters defeated WesWatkins, a seven-term Congressman, by running pro-term limitcommercials and declaring &quot;it's time to reclaim ourgovernment.&quot; Congressman Watkins didn't take a position onterm limits, leading us to wonder what might happen tosomeone in Oklahoma who had actually crusaded against termlimitation. In the GOP primary, the candidate most stronglyin favor of term limits scored an upset victory.   The Oklahoma initiative won wide bipartisan support. A keybacker was former State Rep. Cleta Deatherage Mitchell, whochaired the Appropriations Committee before she retired frompolitics. Ms. Mitchell, a self-described liberal Democrat,says term limitation will be good for her party. &quot;Thenational Democratic Party doesn't understand America outsidethe Beltway,&quot; she says. &quot;I think term limitation is the onlyway Democrats will survive long term. We either force newblood into the party or we will be increasingly out oftouch.&quot;   The Oklahoma initiative doesn't limit terms for Members ofCongress, but it serves as a rocket booster for term-limitvotes in Colorado and California this November. The Coloradoinitiative also covers that state's congressional delegation.Oklahoma supporters of term limits say they plan anotherinitiative extending term limits to Congress.   In Massachusetts, the state's Democratic establishment isstill reeling from John Silber's landslide victory in theDemocratic gubernatorial primary over Francis Bellotti, a30-year political insider and conventional liberal. Though noconservative, Mr. Silber, the acerbic president of BostonUniversity, used his campaign to lambaste liberals and callfor wholesale change in government. So the same Massachusettsparty that nominated Michael Dukakis for Governor three timeshas now chosen John Silber, who voted for Ronald Reagan andGeorge Bush for President.   &quot;There is no question this is a voter rebellion byanybody's definition of the term,&quot; says former MassachusettsDemocratic Senator Paul Tsongas. Angry Democrats, furious attheir party's role in dragging the state into fiscal ruin,also defeated Attorney General James Shannon and at leasteight state legislators.   A new Times Mirror poll confirms what some of us have beenpointing at for some time now: Americans feel increasinglydisconnected from their government. The percentage of adultswho &quot;agree completely&quot; that politicians in Washington losetouch with their constituents quickly has increased from 22%in 1987 to more than 30% today. Exhibit A in this respect isthe Glass Cocoon budget summit in Washington, which persistsin believing that voters will support higher taxes to helpWashington get control of the federal budget. Democraticcandidates around the country know better.   On taxes, Neil Hartigan, the Democratic candidate forGovernor in Illinois, is running to the right of hisRockefeller Republican opponent, Jim Edgar. He pledges toweed out marginal programs and not raise taxes. In NewJersey, congressional candidate Marguerite Chandler isfleeing from Jim Florio, her party's Governor. She's runninga radio ad in her House race denouncing the Florio taxincreases and saying &quot;it's time to tell the Governor enoughis enough.&quot; In a Nebraska House race, State Senator SandraScofield is touting her vote against a state tax increasebacked by her GOP opponent.   With only seven weeks to go in the campaign, the WhiteHouse appears uninterested in helping discontented votersfind their way to candidates who would challenge the statusquo. The fact remains that voters are frustrated withpoliticians who have cemented themselves into office withincumbent-protections, and they are now willing to back termlimits -- a radical measure that is the equivalent of anational vote of no-confidence. The political momentum ofthis movement is now headed straight into November, and onceit's finished with that slate of candidates we suspect it'llhead for 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
