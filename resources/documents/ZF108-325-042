 Many of these new printers were announced atCOMDEX Fall.andP;  Kyocera (pronounced &quot;Key O Sarah&quot;) announced an entry-levelprinter at $2295, the F-800A.andP;  OKIDATA announced its OKILASER 400 WHICH LISTSFOR $1395.andP;  Although the performance and price points are quite different, wedidn't think the comparison would be unfair since our readers have differingvolume requirements.andM;OKILASER 400andM;The press release says &quot;SIMPLICITY, RELIABILITY, EFFICIENCY.&quot;andP;  SMALL, as wellas QUIET, need to be added to the list.andP;  It took less than five minutes fromthe time we opened the box until the test pages were printed.andP;  The printerhas an OKI LED (light emitting diode) engine that helps make the size small(only 5 1/4&quot; tall) and the weight low (less than 25 pounds).andP;  (OKIDATA, 532Fellowship Road, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054, 609-235-2600)andM;The printer operates at four pages per minute, has the standard 300 dots perinch rsolution, and comes with 512K memory, expandable to 2.5 Megabytes.andP;  Ofcourse, most graphics printing requires a minimum of one megabyte to print in300 X 300 dot resolution.andP;  The toner cartridge lasts for about 2,500 copieswhile the image drum is good for about 15,000 pages.andP;  The four manuals thatcome with the printer are informative and useful.andM;The printer comes with seventeen bitmap fonts built-in, which OKI claimsinclude the equivalent to resident HP cartridges A, B, C, F, L, and Y.andP;  Thisincludes Times Roman, Helvetica, Courier, and Line printer fonts.andP;  OKI alsooffers several bitmap font cards as options as well as the capability to have&quot;Macro&quot; cards created for custom logos, signatures, and forms.andP;  Once again,we must point out that normally, with out the appropriate driver for yoursoftware, the built-in fonts beyond those found standard on an HP LaserJet IIare useless.andP;  Although the end user can select one of the built-in fonts fromthe front panel, he can use only one font per document (or print job).andP;  Thiseliminates one of the most important advantages of a laser printer, namelythe ability to use multiple fonts for more professional looking documents.andM;However, since OKI says the built-in fonts give the user the equivalent ofsix HP cartridges, we decided to see if we could use those fonts byinstalling the appropriate printer drivers in our software.andP;  First, we triedMicrosoft Excel for Windows.andP;  In Windows you can install two cartridges, sowe chose &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot;andP;  Printing both Times Roman at either 8 or 10 point andHelvetica at 14.5 point worked beautifully.andP;  Likewise, Microsoft Word, afterwe had installed the HPLASPS.PRD, printed as requested.andM;But the lack of a specific printer driver does not keep us from printing withthe flexibility and professionalism we have come to expect from laserprinters.andP;  Our lab uses soft fonts.andP;  Soft fonts are fonts that can bedownloaded to the printer provided that the printer is Hewlett-PackardLaserJet II compatible.andP;  I wrote about SoftCraft, Inc.'s, package called TheFont Solution Pack in Vol 8, No 3.andP;  This allows us to download severaldifferent fonts to test, among other things, both the quality of the engineas well as its HP compatibility.andM;Again, the OKILASER 400 passed with flying colors.andP;  We also tested envelopeprinting which works OK.andP;  The user accomplishes this by using the manual feedwhich is a set of guides that are on top of the paper tray.andP;  They close downto fit most small documents.andP;  You must then call for the landscape font,preferably via printer driver rather than using the inconvenient front panel.andO;As long as the envelopes were thin, the machine did a fine job of handlingthem.andP;  Crane stationery envelopes would not go through.andM;The paper tray holds 200 sheets of letter size paper with trays for legal,envelopes, executive, and A4 sizes offered as options.andP;  The standard outputpath turns the paper 180 degrees and output bin has a 200 sheet capacity.andO;There is a fold down, rear output stacker that is straight through.andP;  It canbe used for heavier stock such as labels or transparencies that might havetrouble making the 180 degree turn.andP;  As I mentioned above, the paper traycover has adjustable feed guides that make any unusual width paper handlingeasy.andM;Kyocera F-800AandM;The F-800A (Kyocera Unison Inc., 1321 Harbor Bay Parkway, Alameda, CA 94501,415-748-6680) came out of the box and installed easily as most laser printersseem to do.andP;  Or is it because I have taken ten or eleven out of boxes in thelast three months and it has become second nature?andP;  Since the units we testare usually sent back within a couple of weeks, it is sometimes hard toremember exactly how to repack the boxes so the equipment doesn't get damagedin the shipping.andP;  Conveniently, the Kyocera box flaps are printed with bothunpacking and repacking instructions.andM;This printer differed considerably from most of the lasers we have testedrecently.andP;  The installation of the toner, etc.andP;  is a three-part process thatrequires the drum cartridge to be inserted first, then the developer, andfinally the toner.andP;  The developer required the removal of two sealing stripsand this allowed black powder that had accumulated on the surface of thestrips during shipment to spill on to the table.andP;  I have had that problembefore.andP;  In the other printers we have tested, the drum and developer arealready installed and the only requirement is to install the toner.andP;  Thevendor claims that this &quot;dual component toner process&quot; prints darker blacksand cleaner lines.andP;  We actually found that the OKILASER printed much blackerblacks than the F-800A and were unable to notice any major difference withthe naked eye as far as text is concerned.andP;  We chose not use a jeweler's loopto test their claims.andM;The F-800A is the low end of a line of printers that includes, in addition tothis one, three ten page per minute printers, and an eighteen page per minuteprinter.andP;  This is an eight page per minute printer, driven by a Kyoceraengine, has seven printer emulations resident, and comes with 512K of memoryexpandable to 4.5 Megabytes with the standard 300 dots per inch resolution.andO;It has 79 resident bitmapped fonts, three scalable outline fonts, and 39types of barcode printing.andP;  The seven emulations include IBM Graphicsprinter, Diablo 630, Qume Sprint II, NEC Spinwriter, Epson FX-80, LinePrinter, and most importantly for a laser, the Hewlett Packard LaserJetSeries II.andM;The paper tray holds 150 letter size sheets.andP;  A legal size tray is availableas an option.andP;  The printer has a single font slot for Kyocera IC font cardsand the printer accepts downloaded fonts for both the HP as well as Kyocera'sown fonts.andP;  Custom IC cards can be created for logos, letterhead, etc.andM;There are several differences in this printer from the others we have tested.andO;There is no straight through paper path option.andP;  Therefore, card stock,labels and other stiffer papers might have a hard time making the 180 degreeturn to the output stacker.andP;  The paper tray does not have an easilyaccessible manual feed option.andP;  The only way to feed an envelope, forinstance, is to take the top off the paper tray, remove the paper in thetray, and then close the adjustable paper guide to envelope width.andP;  It works,but is clumsy and time consuming at best.andP;  Most printers have the manual feedand adjustable paper guide on top of the tray and are much easier to use.andM;If you remove the paper tray to add or change paper, the printer goes&quot;off-line&quot; which is to be expected.andP;  However, it does not go back &quot;on-line&quot;automatically as the OKILASER 400 does.andP;  You must press the on line key.andM;This printer has seven emulation modes.andP;  Most printers that offer options letthe user make changes from the front panel of the printer, sometimes calledthe Menu.andP;  To make an emulation change on the F-800A, you have to run aprogram.andP;  Before you run the program, you have to enter the program by hand.andO;It's a very simple BASIC program whose listing is included in the User'sManual.andP;  But I had to key it in, although only 19 lines.andP;  After I had keyedit, I discovered that the printer came in HP LJ II mode and I didn't need it.andM;Likewise, there is no way to select fonts easily from the front panel.andO;Kyocera does supply a programming manual with the printer.andP;  Again, I donhtwant to be a programmer to use a laser printer.andP;  The third manual is a &quot;QuickReference&quot; which includes each of the 79 fonts with font numbers.andP;  (Note:There is no way to request the printer to print a font list of the internalfonts.andP;  The OKILASER and every other laser we have tested allows for this.)andO;This does us little good since we will either have to use a Kyocera specificprinter driver (WordPerfect has one and it works nicely) or we will have tobecome programmers to use the fonts.andP;  I did try using the HPLASPS.PRD in Wordand I did get both the Times Roman fonts and the one Helvetica font as I hadbeen able to do with the OKILASER 400 before.andM;If a program is needed to do such things as change the emulation mode, thevendor should supply it on a diskette.andP;  Further, a utility should be providedthat allows font selection and any other setup changes that might berequired.andP;  The inclusion of both a 3.5&quot; and 5 1/4&quot; diskette world not addmuch to the product cost and would certainly not require an end user to writea program to set it up.andP;  If this is not acceptable, then the printer shouldbe redesigned with a usable front panel menu to perform these functions.andM;SummaryandM;I have used each of these printers for a couple of weeks, alternating betweenthem for my printing needs.andP;  The OKILASER is my choice for several reasons.andO;Although it takes a few more square inches on my desktop, it's over threeinches shorter and much quieter.andP;  The simplicity of its design, the rearpaper exit option, a front panel that can be used for all options, and theease of using manual option all make this an excellent desktop laser printer.andO;This $1395 printer gives the Hewlett Packard LaserJet IIP (See Volume 8,number 3) a run for its money at $1495.andM;Although the Kyocera is twice as fast, which accounts for the additional $800list price, the few clumsy items mentioned above make me want to lookelsewhere for a $2295 list price laser solution.andP;  Both the IBM LaserPrinter(See Volume 8, number 6) at a just reduced price of $2395, and the newlyannounced Hewlett Packard LaserJet III at $2395, are much more attractive forthe office shared laser printer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
