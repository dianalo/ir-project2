Though he hadoriginally conceived it as an appended collection of hiscontentious essays in the New York Review, Mr. Draper satdown to write the first full-blown history of the scandalwhen, to his dismay, he found that the unmined documentaryrecord -- more than 50,000 pages of private hearings,depositions, and trial transcripts -- dwarfed all priorreporting, including his own. Happily, Mr. Draper's talentsas a writer are such that the reader is spared any sense ofjust how daunting and dreary his research must have been.   This is not to say that revisiting the entire mess overhundreds of pages and in all its byzantine and bizarre detailwill be anyone's idea of a light early summer read. Yet formost of the general public, which dismissed the scandal astoo tangled to follow, and particularly for PresidentReagan's conservative supporters, who in the heat of therevelations rushed to defend the indefensible, Mr. Draperprovides grist for second thoughts. In ways he does notalways intend, the author shows that history will view theIran-Contra doings as an indelible blot on the Reaganpresidency.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Draper finds that the caricatures of Mr. Reagan's laxmanagement style have obscured two distinct politicaldecisions he -- and he alone -- made (thus the persnicketyreference in the title to &quot;affairs&quot;). The first was thedecision to keep the Nicaraguan contras alive &quot;body and soul&quot;after failing to win an appropriation from Congress; thesecond, the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran. Without adoubt, Mr. Reagan (as well as virtually everyone in officialWashington, from the sainted George Shultz to the benightedRep. Lee Hamilton) knew of the schemes to raise private fundsfor the contras from rich Americans and foreign countries.   The point often lost is how little the administrationactually did for the hapless contras. Mr. Draper tells of oneswanky dinner for private benefactors that raked in $200,000;the contra cut was only $3,000 after sleazy middle-men gottheirs. And for all their high-wire wheeling and dealing, Mr.Reagan and his men didn't have the guts to fight for thecontras openly: &quot;. . . it was decided that it was not a goodidea, as {NSC adviser} McFarlane put it, to campaign for thecontras in an election year. This left only foreign countriesas possible sources of money.&quot;   The Iran initiative, too, was Mr. Reagan's policy, nevermind his later denials. Mr. Draper argues that despite thegrand justifications -- recall the &quot;strategic opening&quot; toIran, and those vaunted &quot;Iranian moderates&quot; -- from day onethe U.S. was dealing with the Ayatollah's henchmen, throughthe slippery intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar, in a straightarms-for-hostages swap. The forgotten context for thisdesperate act, of course, was the massive U.S. intelligencegap that opened after Jimmy Carter yanked the Persian rugfrom under the Shah.   Though Oliver North guided the Iran overtures from theWhite House, the author reports that he drew on the vastresources of a host of government agencies, including theCIA, the departments of State and Defense, even the DrugEnforcement Administration. In so doing, Mr. North had theblessing not only of Mr. Reagan, but of George Bush, BillCasey, Don Regan, Ed Meese, Bud McFarlane and John Poindexter(who, despicably, tried to pin the blame on Israel). Theywere opposed by Caspar Weinberger and Mr. Shultz in whatamounted to nothing more than an old-fashioned policystruggle.   Having set the story straight up to this point, Mr. Draperis unwilling simply to expose Mr. Reagan's rotten judgmentsand leave it at that. Perhaps because his damning facts don'tquite square with the pretentious legalistic schema advancedin his earlier writings, the author is suddenly overcome by athick polemical fog, and then flies off the rails.   He concludes that the Iran debacle would have been avertedif the &quot;constitutional position&quot; of the State Department hadbeen upheld against the &quot;outlaw operations&quot; of the WhiteHouse. But if the president, most of his advisers and severalarms of the government were in as deep as Mr. Draper reveals,how can he say we had government by &quot;cabal&quot; or &quot;junta&quot;? (Onlythe diversion of arms sale profits to the contras comes closeto fitting this description, since Mr. Reagan didn't havedirect knowledge of it, but Mr. Draper views this as acoincidental sideshow to the two main affairs). Likewise, ifthe dithering Congress refused to lay down a marker and leftloopholes in its contra aid ban, the open secret of privatefund-raising was not exactly a &quot;threat to the constitutionalorder,&quot; as he argues.   These rhetorical darts, however, do have a target: thedelegitimation of political control over foreign policy, bythe president, his national security adviser and staff in theWhite House. It's no fluke that since the time of JFK,muscular foreign policies have emanated from these quarters,not from the soft foreign service bureaucracy (or, for thatmatter, the congressional committees) that Mr. Draper takesup the cudgels for. In this light, the author's regard for&quot;traditional or constitutional restraints&quot; is shown to be anargument about substance disguised as procedure. In otherwords, he would safeguard against future blunders likeIran-Contra by shackling future presidents.   ---   Mr. Brock is an editor at Insight magazine in Washington,D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
