Buyout</HEAD><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investors signed a pact to complete the $1.6billion buyout of the CNW Corp. and say they have tendered offersfor 98.6 percent of the company's outstanding common shares.   The buyout group, formed by investment banker Blackstone Groupand CNW management, said Monday it has accepted for payment up to 91percent of all validly tendered common and preferred shares.   Under an agreement reached in June, the buyout group, known asChicago and North Western Acquisition Corp., offered to pay $45.50cash per common share.   At the time, New York's Chemical Bank committed $585 million inbuyout financing and the New York investment firm of Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. agreed to provide up to $475 million infinancing.   CNW Corp. is the parent of the Chicago and North WesternTransportation Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees thatoperates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest. It also hascommuter lines in the Chicago area.   The buyout group said 98.6 percent of the company's outstandingcommon shares had been tendered before its offer expired on Friday.   Officials say Blackstone's financing structure will not requiresignificant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused bythe takeover. But the firm will complete CNW's previously announcedplan to sell its Chicago-area commuter operations and will divestsome real estate and surplus equipment.   The buyout offer prompted a hostile suitor, New York-basedJaponica Partners, to withdraw its own bid to acquire CNW.</TEXT></DOC>
