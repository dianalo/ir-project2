CT hasrevolutionized the practice of medicine in virtually every specialty.In vascular surgery the routine use of CT in a variety of problems haschanged the way diagnoses are made. It allows prompt recognition of conditionsthat were difficult if not impossible to diagnose using older techniques.Nowhere is this concept better epitomized than in the realm of vascularsurgical emergencies. In these cases, life or limb threatening conditionssuch as hemorrhage, prosthetic graft infection, or vascular occlusionexist as the result of aneurysm, trauma, dissection, tumor, or previousarterial surgery. Prompt and appropriate diagnosis of the immediate problemand its cause is afforded by the use of contrast enhanced CT. This frequentlyobviates the need for angiography and eliminates less accurate testssuch as plain films, barium studies, nuclear medicine scans, and/or ultrasound.In the past several years magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bodyhas become a practical reality. The technique offers promise in the imagingof many disease processes. In the neural axis it has become a preferredmodality due to inherently higher contrast resolution and freedom fromartifacts. Progress in body imaging has been slower due to problems withmotion artifact but early results in cardiovascular imaging demonstratethat MRI offers theoretical advantages over CT that may make it the imagingtest of choice in vascular disease. This paper identifies those vascularsurgical emergencies in which CT and MRI are most useful and clarifiesand illustrates the diagnostic features of the various conditions encountered.</TEXT></DOC>
