Eighteen laboratories analyzed prepared samples by theliquid scintillation (LS) method, and twelve laboratories analyzed thesame samples by the Lucas Cell (LC) method. A comparison of the grandaverages for the three samples with the known values for those samplesshowed good accuracy for both methods. The accuracy index was not lessthan 94% for any of the three samples when analyzed by either method.Test results for the LS method showed better precision than test resultsfor the LC method. The average repeatability (within-laboratory) precisionfor the LS method was 3.6 plus or minus 3.0% at 95% confidence and forthe LC method it was 6.4 plus or minus 3.8% at 95% confidence. The averagereproducibility (combined within-and between-laboratory) precision forthe LS method was 10.2 plus or minus 4.2% at 95% confidence and for theLC method it was 17.6 plus or minus 4.2% at 95% confidence.</TEXT></DOC>
