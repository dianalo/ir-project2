Melvin van Peebles wrote and directed gritty,inexpensive, nerve-touching movies in the late '60s and early '70s, starringblack heroes who lived by their own moral codes on the fringes of whitesociety.;    Now Mario van Peebles has topped his old man with &quot;New JackCity,&quot; a leaner, meaner model directed on the same lines.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LEAN, MEAN AND SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Film Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     His movie has a charismatic good guy -- solitary cop Scotty Appleton, whodevotes his life to squashing drug dealers -- and a charismatic bad guy, NinoBrown, a dealer so powerful he seems unsquashable.;    The script by ThomasLee Wright and Barry Michael Cooper starts off like &quot;Scarface,&quot; a film Brownwatches on his wide-screen TV. Brown (played by Wesley Snipes) decides tomodernize the crack trade: He and his cohorts form the Cash Money Brothers,turning an apartment building into an impenetrable cocaine factory.;    Apolice detective (Mario van Peebles) recruits two streetwise, sullen cops(rapper Ice-T and Judd Nelson) to mastermind an infiltration.;    Except for afew distracting scenes with love interests, the film moves forward withsingle-minded determination. Van Peebles, who had never directed a feature,doesn't make the typical novice mistake of drumming points home over andover.;    Killings happen in an eye blink, and the one sustained gunfightblazes for 15 or 20 seconds. Yet the movie doesn't fall into the mind-numbingjumpiness beloved of young directors weaned on MTV.;    Van Peebles shouldhave found more proficient actors for supporting parts (himself included), butthe two leads hold the screen: Ice-T has rough, unflappable grace, and Snipeshas an ominous charm as the Nose Candy Man.;     New Jack City;(star)(star)(star); Rated: R (violence, profanity, brief nudity, sex); Cast:Wesley Snipes, Ice-T, Judd Nelson, Mario van Peebles; Director: Van Peebles;Screenwriters: Thomas Lee Wright and Barry Michael Cooper  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LAWRENCE TOPPMAN, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910309  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  331  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 9, 199100069038,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
