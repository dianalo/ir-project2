Responding to questioning by a congressional panel, he said ofestimates of potential losses, ``I think $6 billion would be toohigh, $1 billion would be too low.''   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., came up with the $2 billion figureand asked Kemp his opinion of it.   While saying his department has not come up with its ownestimate, Kemp said he did not disagree with Schumer's figure. Healso said he believed recent efforts to cut the government's losseshave been successful.   Earlier, Kemp denounced a system under which highly paidconsultants helped developers try to win federal housing contracts.But he said he would not ``wage war'' on effective programs in hisdepartment.   ``I do not want to wage war on programs ... I am not trying towage war on the goals that have been set for these programs to helpneedy people and low income people,'' said the secretary.   He also told a congressional panel he was taking steps to correct``fundamental flaws'' and ``lax accounting and managementprocedures'' at his department.   Kemp, who took over the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment six months ago, said he had told agency employees in amemo that their jobs would depend on putting an end to favoritism.   And he said outsiders discovered to be abusing departmentprograms will be barred ``from doing business with HUD and all otherfederal agencies.''   Kemp's comments came in remarks to the House Employment andHousing Subcommittee, which is looking into allegations of fraud andmismanagement at the agency.   ``Some of our most serious problems have come in programs wheresubstantial subsidies are given to developers,'' Kemp said.   ``That extra money goes for excess profits for the developer and,clearly, to cover consultant fees,'' he said. ``We give thedeveloper a reason to hire a consultant, and we give the successfulbidder the money to pay consultants' fees.''   The department's moderate-rehabilitation program was criticizedin an April audit by the HUD inspector general who alleged influencepeddling and favoritism in contract awards to developers who hiredformer HUD and other government employees as consultants.   The audit estimated HUD could lose as much as $413 million inexcess subsidies over the life of the contracts.   Several Reagan administration insiders, including former InteriorSecretary James Watt, have been questioned at House hearings intowhat they did for their consulting fees and what the fee-payersexpected in return.   Kemp said Tuesday, ``HUD programs shall operate withoutfavoritism'' and awards will be made on the basis of need and merit.   The housing secretary said that in a memo to HUD employees lastmonth he warned ``performance evaluations and job security willdepend on how these reforms are promptly implemented and enforced.''   ``The Department of Housing and Urban Development will maintain apolicy of zero tolerance for violations of our standards ofconduct,'' said Kemp, pledging ``the highest'' ethical standards atthe department.   Kemp has testified several times before Congress in recentmonths, a sharp contrast to his predecessor Samuel Pierce, whomembers of Congress say was generally unavailable during hiseight-year tenure during the Reagan administration.   Since taking office Kemp has suspended, revised or restrictedthree troubled programs _ moderate rehabilitation, mortgagecoinsurance and Title X land development mortgage insurance _ whichprovide subsidized housing to low- and moderate-income families.   Last week he curtailed an elderly-housing program in which 30percent of the projects had resulted in foreclosure.   However, he has promised he will not use HUD's problems tocurtail the federal government's role in housing.   The subcommittee later this week is scheduled to hear from twoformer HUD officials involved in a project that was pushed by aformer law partner of then-HUD Secretary Pierce.   One of the former officials, Shirley McVay Wiseman, has said thatshe quit HUD because Pierce ordered her to finance the NorthCarolina project despite objections by career agency officials. Thesecond, Janet Hale, was named by Pierce to replace Ms. Wiseman andthen approved the funding. Ms. Hale is now a budget analyst at theOffice of Management and Budget but is steering clear of mostHUD-related matters while the subject is being investigated.   The subcommittee also is to recall Pierce, who said in an earlierappearance that he had no direct role in funding decisions.   Newsday reported Tuesday that Pierce, while HUD secretary, wasone of 2,862 partners in an investment partnership that bought aKansas City apartment building through a HUD-insured constructionloan. Pierce listed the $20,000 investment in MLH Properties Ltd.Partnership II on his financial disclosure forms but said theventure had ``no HUD involvement,'' Newsday reported.   Pierce said he never personally checked whether the partnershiphad any HUD-related dealings. ``Look, that's peanuts,'' Pierce wasquoted as telling the newspaper. ``There's no money. It's not enoughto worry about.''</TEXT></DOC>
