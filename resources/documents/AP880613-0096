Dr. Ijaz Gilani, an analyst at the Pakistani-based Institute ofStrategic Studies, said he has received reports that the Sovietforces are back at the garrison of Jalalabad and Khost, near thePakistani border.   There was no independent confirmation of Gilani's report.   Gilani said Afghan forces have remained on the defensive sincethe Soviets began withdrawing their troops on May 15.   ``The low morale of the Kabul regime soldiers touched a new lowwith the withdrawal of Russian troops from certain garrison townsand strong points,'' Gilani said.   Soviet troops first entered Afghanistan in 1979 to support itsMarxist government.   Jalalabad, on the main road from Peshawar, Pakistan, to thecapital of Kabul, was the first Soviet garrison vacated. AlthoughSoviet officials claimed the garrison was left completely to theAfghan troops, guerrillas say they have spotted Soviet soldiersthere long after the reported pullout.   Khost, scene of a major battle early this year after it wasseized by guerrillas, was recently reported again on the verge ofcollapse as rebels poured in from the Pakistan border, just 15miles away.   Gilani said he had no precise figures on the Sovietredeployment, but officials in Moscow and Kabul have warned theymight revise their nine-month withdrawal time frame if Pakistan andthe United States continue to arm the Moslem guerrillas.   ``The war is still continuing at a medium pace, with moreinitiative in the hands of the (guerrillas),'' Gilani said.   Statistics compiled by Gilani and his analysts indicated therewere 266 battles in Afghanistan in May, down from 431 in thecorresponding month in 1987. He said 231 of the attacks last monthwere launched by guerrillas and 35 by Soviet-Kabul forces.   According to estimates by the Institute of Strategic Studies,some 2,450 Afghan troops defected to the guerrillas last month.However, Gilani said it was difficult to determine the differencebetween outright defections and cases in which Afghan troops havesurrendered to the insurgents.   The report also said 868 soldiers were killed in May, including54 Soviets, 192 guerrillas, 542 Afghan troops and 80 unidentifiedpeople.   In April, a total of 1,149 soldiers died, compared to aSeptember 1987 high of 2,351, according to the report.</TEXT></DOC>
