<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-1112 </DOCNO><TEXT>A consistently formulated differencing approach is applied to the diffusion-syntheticacceleration of discrete ordinates calculations based on various spatialdifferencing schemes. The diffusion &quot;coupling&quot; equations derived foreach scheme are contrasted to conventional coupling relations and areshown to permit derivation of either point- or box-centered diffusiondifference equations. The resulting difference equations are shown tobe mathematically equivalent, in slab geometry, to equations derivedby applying Larsen's four-step procedure to the S/sub 2/ equations. Fourierstability analysis of the acceleration method applied to slab model problemsis used to demonstrate that, for any S/sub n/ differencing scheme (a)the upper bound on the spectral radius of the method occurs in the fine-meshlimit and equals that of the spatially continuous case (0.22466), and(b) the spectral radius decreases with increasing mesh size to an asymptoticvalue andless;0.13135. This model problem performance is somewhat superior tothat of Larsen's approach, for which the spectral radius is bounded by0.25 in the wide-mesh limit. Numerical results of multidimensional, heterogeneous,scattering-dominated problems are also presented to demonstrate the rapidconvergence of accelerated discrete ordinates calculations using variousspatial differencing schemes.</TEXT></DOC>
