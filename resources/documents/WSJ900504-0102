This may sound like a flimsy scenario toestablish insider trading, but it was enough to make theposse of former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and theSecurities and Exchange Commission saddle up. On Wednesday, afederal appeals court ruled that this case should never havebeen brought.   The news reached Robert Chestman in his cell at Allenwood.He was doing time there for the crime that he did not commit-- and that the judges ruled does not exist. The case againstMr. Chestman, the former broker, would be laughable if itweren't for his anguish and the confusion his convictioncaused about what if anything &quot;insider trading&quot; means. Here'swhat happened:</LP><TEXT>   In 1986, the Waldbaums decided to sell their stores toAandamp;P. Ira Waldbaum called his sister to have her gather herstock certificates. Elderly and in poor health, she asked adaughter who lived with her to drive her to get thesecurities. The daughter called her sister, Susan Loeb, toarrange car pooling for their children. Mrs. Loeb was anxiousthat her mother might be ill, but the mother said the tripwas just to pick up the certificates. Mrs. Loeb told herhusband. The prosecutors claimed that Mr. Loeb then calledhis broker, Mr. Chestman, to say he had &quot;some definite&quot; butundisclosed information that Waldbaum stock would rise. Mr.Chestman bought the stock.   This was not an obvioussuitcases-of-cash-for-inside-information crime a la IvanBoesky. Indeed, Mr. Chestman claimed all along that he boughtthe stock because of takeover rumors and before speaking toMr. Loeb. He would have been a fourth-level tippee of marketinformation. The prosecutors insisted that Mr. Chestmanviolated their &quot;misappropriation theory,&quot; which essentiallysays that anyone who has more information than someone elseis a potential criminal.   Mr. Chestman was indicted and convicted on 31 counts ofinsider trading, perjury and mail fraud. The legal theory wasthat he had aided and abetted Mr. Loeb in violating his dutyto his family. In May, trial Judge John Walker Jr. threw Mr.Chestman in the slammer for two years and fined him $250,000&quot;to send a message to Wall Street and the financial communitythat those who cheat the markets out of greed must pay aprice for their conduct.&quot; The SEC took away Mr. Chestman'sbroker license. Because he couldn't get a job doing anythinguntil he'd done his time, he went to jail pending the appeal.   On Wednesday, the appeals court rejected the entireprosecution case. The most stunning reversal came when two ofthe three judges invalidated an SEC rule adopted in 1980 thathas been the favorite of overzealous regulators. Rule 14e-3makes it a crime for someone to trade if he simply possesses&quot;material information,&quot; even if it was someone else whoviolated a duty to get it.   Judge Daniel Mahoney said the SEC does not have the powerto issue a rule criminalizing trades where the defendant didnot himself breach some fiduciary duty to get theinformation. Judge Mahoney emphasized the &quot;rule of lenity,&quot;which holds that people mustn't be convicted when the law isvague and unpredictable.   The Second Circuit in New York has upheld many 14e-3convictions. We suspect the accumulated abuses in this andother Giuliani white-collar cases persuaded judges in thiscase to send a message. When the judges reviewed the recordof the trial, they found slim evidence that Mr. Loeb had evenspoken with Mr. Chestman before the trades, and that therewas much evidence that he hadn't. They threw out the perjuryconvictions. And they rejected the mail-fraud charges becauseMr. Chestman had not committed any fraud at all.   The 14e-3 issue aside, all three judges said that even ifMr. Loeb had passed on information that Waldbaum stock wouldrise, this would not have made Mr. Chestman a criminal.&quot;After passing through several family channels, it cannot besaid that the information was confidential to any degree orwas any more than `family gossip,'&quot; Judge Roger Miner wrotefor the court.   At least in the New York jurisdiction, the law again makessense: Do not trade information if you have a contractual orother legal duty not to steal the information, but it's safeagain to dig out and analyze information in the marketswithout worrying about Allenwood. Faced with many appeals ofconvictions in other 14e-3 cases, the SEC will probably lobbythe New York prosecutors to appeal. Or maybe Congress willfinally write a clear, bright-line definition of insidertrading; we'll cross our fingers that Congress doesn't makethe law more confusing.   If there's any justice, U.S. v. Chestman will be aprecedent for more reversals as other questionableconvictions make it to the appeals courts. It may becoincidence that this decision comes a week after the Milkenplea. But prosecutions under the vague &quot;misappropriationtheory&quot; are the foundation on which many created the largernotion that the whole market now consists of significantillegal activity. No one rode this harder than RudolphGiuliani, who prosecuted Mr. Chestman shortly after theBoesky conviction. Now the court has made clearer who in themarket is a criminal and who is not a criminal.</TEXT></DOC>
