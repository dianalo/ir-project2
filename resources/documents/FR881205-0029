One of the provisions requiredthe States to adopt regulations that represent RACT for stationary sourcescovered by an EPA Control Technology Guidance (CTG) document and for anyother major source as needed to assure reasonable further progress (RFP)and attainment. On February 14, 1980, at 45 FR 9903, EPA approved the LouisianaOzone Attainment Plan and incorporated it into the SIP. As part of theattainment plan, Louisiana adopted regulation 22.8, the waste gas streamregulation. This rule requires sources to combust waste gas streams containingnonhalogenated compounds at 1300anddegrees; Fahrenheit for 0.3 seconds orgreater in a direct-flame afterburner or an equally effective device andapplies across the State to all sources regardless of size. A company canseek an exemption if it can demonstrate that it emits less than 100 tonsper year (tpy), and that it either cannot support the combustion withoutit using auxiliary fuel or it cannot practically or safely accomplish thecombustion without causing economic hardship. EPA must approve any suchexemption before the SIP can be amended federally.The Baton Rouge nonattainment area was to have achieved the National AmbientAir Quality Standard for ozone by December 31, 1982. Both East and WestBaton Rouge parishes continued to exceed the standard after the deadline,and on February 14, 1984, EPA requested a revision to the ozone SIP forthose parishes.Although other air quality control regions (AQCRs) in Louisiana were alsonot in attainment by that date, EPA excluded rural areas from the SIP calls,because the Agency believed that attainment in urban areas would assurereasonable further progress (RFP) and attainment in those rural areas.EPA's post `82 SIP policy requires RACT for stationary sources in urbanizedareas for which EPA has issued a CTG document, and it requires controlof additional sources where necessary to achieve RFP in the area of theSIP call. To satisfactorily demonstrate RFP, a SIP must include among otherthings RACT for all major source categories besides those that were coveredby a CTG document. (See 44 FR 20377.) Because Sid Richardson is a majornon-CTG source located in the metropolitan Baton Rouge AQCR, the companymust implement RACT. EPA holds that LAQR 22.8(a) is RACT for Sid Richardsonand that control of acetylene emissions is required.The State of Louisiana argues, on the contrary, that the proposed SIP revisionis acceptable for several reasons. First, available data show that acetylenehas low photochemical reactivity and toxicity. Second, the ozone modelingthat includes the demonstration of attainment in the Baton Rouge area didnot consider controlling acetylene emissions from the Sid Richardson Addisplant. Third, incineration of the tail gas would require auxiliary fuel,extensive capital cost and significantly increased operating costs. In addition to the arguments put forth by the State in its official submittalto EPA, Sid Richardson prepared a RACT analysis, which was sent to theLouisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) in a letter datedDecember 12, 1986. The State passed along a copy of this report to EPAfor informal consideration. Later, in a letter dated March 12, 1987, SidRichardson sent LDEQ two other documents to supplement its RACT analysis.Finally, the State submitted an updated SIP revision on May 29, 1987, thatclarified some language and also incorporated the company's December RACTanalysis and the March amendments. Meanwhile, Sid Richardson identifiedsome of the information contained in its RACT analysis as ``confidential''in a letter to EPA on May 29, 1987. EPA has reviewed this information andthe company's support for its claims of confidentiality and agrees thatthis information cannot be released for public inspection. This informationincludes, among other things, pre-tax profit margin, product manufacturingcosts, and fuel costs for a defunct flare at the facility. The informationin the public docket includes the following: the Sid Richardson RACT analysis,the Agency's initial review of that document, the Agency's revised reviewof that document, and the EPA technical evaluation and any other relevantdocument or information that has not been declared confidential. EPA Review<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Reactivity of Acetylene </ITAG>In response to the State's claim that data show acetylene to have low reactivity,EPA counters that because the existing, published data show the reactivityof acetylene to range from 0.6 to 3 times that of ethane (EPA's standardfor atmospheric photochemical reactivity), the best statement on the matteris that the data are inconclusive. Recent studies show acetylene to be2.73 times more reactive than ethane, which contradicts previously publishedevidence that acetylene is only 0.6 times more reactive than ethane. Since1977, EPA's policy has been that all VOCs are to be included in SIP controlstrategies except those which have been listed specifically as exempt inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. So far, four compounds were listed as exempton July 8, 1977, at 42 FR 35314; another was listed as exempt on June 4,1979, at 44 FR 32042; and six freon compounds were listed on July 22, 1980,at 45 FR 48941. EPA exempted these eleven chemicals from consideration,because scientists have determined that the compounds have ``negligible''photochemical reactivity. Acetylene is not an exempt agent, nor has itbeen proposed for exemption. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Sid Richardson's Present Control </ITAG>The Sid Richardson Addis plant vents about sixty percent of its tail gasesthrough the primary filter stacks. The emissions from these stacks containan average of 0.21 percent acetylene, or slightly more than 1500 tpy. Theactual composition of these emissions varies with the grade of carbon blackbeing produced. The tail gases not emitted from the primary filter stacks, approximatelyforty percent, are routed to the pellet dryers as low BTU fuel. The emissionsfrom the dryer stacks do not contain acetylene. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Louisiana's Modeling Support </ITAG>The State contends that its air quality modeling supports the positionthat acetylene emissions from Sid Richardson will have no adverse effectupon attainment of the ozone standard in the Baton Rouge area. The modelingsubmitted by the State in support of its post '82 SIP demonstrates thata twenty-one percent VOC reduction is necessary in the Baton Rouge areato attain the standard by December 31, 1987. In a letter dated January 30, 1987, the State discussed supplemental ozonemodeling performed by LDEQ using the OZIPM-2 model for each day that couldhave any impact on the ozone SIP. LDEQ determined that the parcel of airpassed over the plant on three days and adjusted the value for the VOCemissions put into the calculations to reflect the plant's acetylene emissionsin accordance with the carbon bond III photochemical mechanism used inthe model. The results showed that none of the VOC requirement changedand the level of reduction remained at twenty-one percent. EPA is not surprisedby the State's finding, because the model used is an EKMA model that isnot sufficiently sensitive to small changes in emissions and would notproduce significant changes in ambient ozone levels or the resulting controltarget. Therefore, EPA rejects the State's analysis of the ozone modelingresults. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. RACT Analysis </ITAG>As mentioned above, EPA has reviewed Sid Richardson's RACT analysis submittedto LDEQ and disagrees with the conclusion that any of the three methodsof control presented in the document will cause economic hardship. SidRichardson evaluated three alternatives for control of acetylene emissions:flaring, thermal combustion, and cogeneration. The company concludes thatnone of the alternatives is economically feasible. However, EPA's analysisshows that the installation of any of these three options will not causean adverse economic impact. Indeed, installation of a cogeneration unitwith the use of the tail gas emissions as fuel in steam boilers_which accordingto EPA's evaluation is the most capital intensive option_will generatesavings. 1. Economic ReviewEPA prepared its economic analysis with financial estimates that wouldbe directly comparable to information prepared for NSPS and CTG analysesover the past ten to fifteen years for various industries. Therefore, EPAused constant 1986 dollars and a 5% discount rate without tax considerationrather than annual inflation adjusted dollars and a 10.3% discount ratewith tax consideration. Sid Richardson based its economic review upon standardaccounting tax, depreciation, and debt retirement. The company believesthat its method is superior for a site specific RACT analysis, becauseit uses factors that it asserts are what businesses actually consider whendetermining whether or not to spend capital dollars on a long-term project.EPA, on the other hand, maintains that tax effects and inflation are twofactors which produce the greatest distortions among industries when preparingcost analyses. EPA's approach to regulate these distortions is to ignoretax effects and to use constant dollars to adjust for inflation. The resultof ignoring tax effects is to actually overstate the cost of the project.Finally, EPA's decision to use constant 1986 dollars and a discount rateof five percent produces essentially the same results as Sid Richardson'suse of five percent inflation and a ten and one-half percent discount rate(i.e., 5.5% real discount rate for Sid Richardson's calculations versus5% discount rate for EPA's figures).Another major disagreement between the two economic analyses concerns theestimation of the useful life of the hardware for the cogeneration unit.EPA considers twenty years as a reasonable estimate for calculating depreciation;whereas, Sid Richardson contends the unit will have a much shorter lifeof five to ten years. The company argues that EPA agreed to the ten-yearexpected life for the flares and for the combustor and that similar considerationshould be given to the cogeneration facility. However, EPA stands by itsdecision to use the depreciation values published by the Internal RevenueService in its publication 534, ``Depreciation,'' for Electric UtilityCombustion Turbine Production Plant and considers the equipment lifespangiven in this publication to be generally acceptable. EPA believes thatthe company would have to provide more documentation to support an acceleratedschedule for depreciation.In general EPA finds little support for economic infeasibility or adverseeconomic impact. EPA concludes that the cost per ton of VOC control isreasonable and is lower than for many other regulated sources. Furthermore,EPA finds that each of the options for control of acetylene seems economicallyviable, and, in fact, the cogeneration control option would result in anet savings.2. Technical Review<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Flares</ITAG>In its RACT analysis, Sid Richardson claims that installation of flarestacks could not comply with the combustion parameters of 1300 anddegrees;Ffor 0.3 seconds as specified in LAQR 22.8. EPA does not fully agree withthis statement, because while flares may not comply with such parameters,the efficiency of flares is measured by other criteria, e.g., BTU contentof gas, gas velocity and residence time. Generally, flares have an efficiencyof about 98% or greater combustion of hydrocarbons.Given this estimation of efficiency, installation of flares for controlof acetylene emissions will burn more waste gas than the 41% now combustedat the Addis plant. Sid Richardson believes that the installation of flareswill ``pose a significant hazard to plant personnel and process equipment.''However, certain factors regarding the design and the location of the flareneed to be taken into account when determining the potential hazard. SidRichardson does not address issues like these in its RACT analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Combustors</ITAG>Sid Richardson's second alternative in the RACT analysis for control ofacetylene emissions is the installation of a thermal combustor. Basically,a combustor is a furnace especially designed to burn waste gases. For combustionto take place, additional fuel of approximately 10% enrichment with naturalgas and air must be exposed to a temperature high enough to oxidize theVOCs. With this alternative, as with the previously discussed installationof flares, the combustion products are released to the atmosphere. Thisalternative is energy consumptive, yet, at the same time, it generatesheat that may be of some use to another process.Sid Richardson alleges that the plant has no use for the heat generatedby the combustor, and it also asserts that extreme care must be taken tocontrol the tail gas flow from the combustor. Excess suction on the system,for example, could collapse the primary filters or pull in atmosphericair that could then cause an explosion anywhere in the collection and combustionsystem. While EPA agrees that there are safety concerns associated witha combustor, the Agency believes that this means is technically feasiblewith proper engineering safeguards to serve as a control on acetylene emissions.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Cogeneration</ITAG>Sid Richardson's third alternative is cogeneration. This alternative doesnot consume as much energy as a combustor and can produce electricity.Also, this alternative does not pose a hazard to plant personnel or processequipment. The installation of a cogeneration unit for the purpose of controllingacetylene emissions is economically and technically feasible.The company claims that alternative is impractical, because the electricityis of no use to the local consumer power company. EPA notes that Sid Richardsondoes not state if the energy is of use within its own plant. EPA believesthat the energy produced could be useful to the local power company givena rate increase.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Major Sources in Nonattainment Areas</ITAG>The Sid Richardson Addis plant emits 1,514 tons per year acetylene andthus qualifies as a major source. The plant is located in West Baton RougeParish, an urban ozone nonattainment area under a SIP call for failureto meet the 1982 ozone attainment deadline. EPA's policy requires RACTfor all sources covered by a CTG document and for all other major sourcesin any ozone nonattainment area that failed to meet the December 31, 1982,deadline. Because of Sid Richardson's size and location, the company mustcontrol its acetylene emissions to the RACT standard. At this time, theonly applicable RACT control in the existing SIP covering vent gas emissionsis LAQR 22.8; therefore, an exemption from control limits for emissionof acetyelene cannot be approved. Of course, LDEQ may propose to EPA analternative method of control equivalent to RACT.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA proposes to disapprove the exemption of further control of acetyleneemissions for the Sid Richardson Carbon and Gasoline Company, Addis, Louisiana,for the following reasons:(1) The source is located in an urban area currently designated as nonattainmentfor ozone and must be covered by a SIP that requires RACT for all majorsources;(2) The revision request does not adequately support its argument thatthe emission limitations already in the Louisiana SIP for this source arenot RACT;(3) The State has not demonstrated to EPA that Regulation 22.8 of the LAQRfor control of VOC from tail gas emissions cannot be technically or economicallymet; and(4) Even though acetylene may have a low reactivity compared to certainother VOCs, EPA still considers it to be a reactive chemical and has notspecifically exempted it from SIP demonstrations. Therefore, acetyleneemissions must be controlled.Pursuant to the provision of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities, because it affects only one source and imposes no new requirementson the source.Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``MAJOR.'' EPA submittedthis proposed rulemaking action to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[</ITAG><T4>Editorial Note</T4>: This document was received at the Office of the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 23, 1988.]<ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
