Four of the victims, some in tears, told the House BankingCommittee on Tuesday how Lincoln officials led them to believe junkbonds in the thrift's holding company, American Continental Corp.,purchased with their converted savings were federally insured andsafe.   All of them blamed American Continental's chairman, Charles H.Keating Jr., and five senators they tagged the ``Keating Five'' whoaccepted a total of $1.3 million in political contributions fromthe Phoenix millionaire.   ``Up against the likes of Charles Keating and the influence hewas able to buy from elected officials and others in high office,we didn't stand a chance,'' said Shirley Lampel, a partially blindwidow from Tustin, Calif., who lost $30,000.   The five senators _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle,D-Mich.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz., and JohnGlenn, D-Ohio _ are subjects of inquiries by the Senate EthicsCommittee and the FBI.   Officials are investigating whether the senators improperlyintervened on behalf of Keating in April 1987 with thriftregulators who were considering seizing Lincoln on grounds it wasunsound. Despite a formal recommendation a month later recommendingjust that, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board waited until April 1989to seize Lincoln.   All of the senators have denied any wrongdoing in the Lincolnfiasco, which is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion and22,000 bondholders like Mrs. Lampel, a majority of them retirees,another $250 million.   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, who as a White House aide toPresident Bush designed the $200 billion-plus taxpayer bailout ofthe Sandamp;L industry, said the experiences of Mrs. Lampel and othershas convinced him the banking laws need to be rewritten again.   ``To be allowed to sell junk bonds of your parent (company) inthe lobby of a financial institution with the sinecure of federalprotection is something that Congress perhaps ought to prohibit,''Breeden said. ``It's a little bit like having the requirement youcan't sell liquor within so many yards of a polling place.''   While Mrs. Lampel and the others were being encouraged byLincoln officials to move their money out of federally insureddeposits into the high-risk, uninsured bonds, the SEC was trying todetermine if the holding company had filed false financialstatements.   Breeden said a May 20, 1988, ``memorandum of understanding''between the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Lincoln accepting thethrift's accounting on $135 million in disputed transactions gavethe parent company a powerful legal tool to resist the SEC's probe.   ``The regulator of the subsidiary institution said, in essence,that financial statements were all right,'' he said.   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, now called theOffice of Thrift Supervision, said the memorandum ``in no way couldhave impeded'' the SEC investigation. ``They're independent. ...There's nothing we can do to get in the way,'' he said.   Breeden also said the SEC has turned over some of the evidencein its probe to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles consideringpossible criminal charges against Keating and his associates.   Keating and M. Danny Wall, the bank board's chairman and nowhead of the Office of Thrift Supervision, have been subpoenaed totestify before the House committee next week.   While the committee has focused on Wall, the victims directedmuch of their anger at Cranston, who raised more than $970 millionfrom Keating for his own and other Democratic political causes.   Connie Wickman, 78, of West Hills., Calif., said she and herhusband were heartbroken when they learned their $25,000 inretirement funds had been lost.   ``I had no idea this man could be so corrupted,'' said Mrs.Lampel. ``What Alan Cranston did here was not only foolish; it wascruel, it was dishonest. It has devastated people and it hasdevastated me.''   Murray Flander, a spokesman for Cranston, said the senator has``nothing but compassion for these people.''   Among other Lincoln developments Tuesday:   _The House committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,D-Texas, said he intends to investigate other failed thrifts``beyond Lincoln,'' including Silverado Savings in Colorado, onwhose board Neal Bush, the president's son, once served.   _Riegle, the Senate Banking Committee's chairman, acknowledgedthrough a spokeswoman that in March 1987 he visited a lavish resortKeating was building in Arizona with Lincoln funds to give a speechto American Continental employees.   _Breeden said former SEC Commissioner Barbara Thomas, anappointee of former President Carter, had called the agency's topenforcement official as a character witness for Keating.   A former top Bank Board official testified last week that Ms.Thomas had approached her about obtaining for Keating an earlyexamination audit of Lincoln by regional thrift regulators.Documents obtained by the House panel show that Ms. Thomas, as ofearly this year, had an outstanding unsecured loan of $250,000 fromLincoln.</TEXT></DOC>
