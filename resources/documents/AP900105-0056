Curry, administrator of the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration.   The agency said Thursday that it would phase in the newrequirement over three years as it did with the rule on crashprotection for cars.   Under the regulation, 20 percent of the vans, light trucks,multipurpose passenger vehicles and small buses manufactured in the1994 model year would be required to provide the bags or automaticsafety belts.   The safety features would be required on 50 percent of the 1995model vehicles and on all of those manufactured in 1996.   Under the rule, vehicles that offer a driver's side air bagcould have a manual safety belt on the passenger side and stillcomply with the agency's standard through the 1997 model year. Butmanufacturers that don't provide a driver's side air bag would haveto install automatic belts for the driver and on the front-seatpassenger side.   ``We are encouraging air bags as the technology of choicebecause air bags in combination with existing lap and shoulderbelts offer the best protection available,'' Curry said.   All new passenger cars sold in the United States now must haveair bags or automatic belts.   ``They are saving thousands of lives and preventing tens ofthousands of serious injuries each year,'' Curry said. ``The sameprotection should be given to those who choose to buy today'spopular minivans and light trucks.''   Deaths and injuries to light truck riders increased from 6,500in 1984 to 8,300 in 1988, he said. Number of the vehicles sold alsohave increased.   The agency's move drew praise from Sen. Jack Danforth, R-Mo.,ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee and a longtimeair bag proponent.   ``Air bag technology has been around since the early 1960s, butonly this year did we see large numbers of cars with air bags,''Danforth said. ``We should not go through another long struggle toget air bags into the vehicles now used frequently by families.''   The rule would apply to all vans, trucks, buses and multipurposevehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds and anunloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds or less.   Included would be motor homes, convertibles, open-body-typevehicles, walk-in van-type trucks and vehicles carryingchassis-mounted campers.   Also under the rule, light trucks and passenger cars with onlytwo seating positions would have to be equipped to support a childsafety seat on the passenger side.   The announcement opens a 60-day period for public comment on theproposed rule. Afterward, the agency will write a final version andset a date for implementing it.</TEXT></DOC>
