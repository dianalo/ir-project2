Danny Wall resigned today as thegovernment's chief regulator of savings and loans, saying he wasmade a ``scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thriftcrisis'' and the record bailout of the Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation.   As he has done before, Wall insisted at a packed news conferenceand in his resignation letter to President Bush that he did nothingwrong and leaves with ``personal integrity that will stand up toany scrutiny.'' But he said the fact that he was the ``primarytarget'' of a congressional investigation would create a hardshipat the Office of Thrift Supervision, which he directed.   Wall complained about a ``steady stream of one-sided informationemanating from the House Banking Committee hearings concerning myhandling of Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan.''   He specifically cited Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman ofthe House Banking Committee, whom he accused of resorting to``corruption of the truth and abandonment of our historicaldevotion to fair play and due process in his effort to remove mefrom office,''   Gonzalez said Wall had ``done the best thing for himself and thefederal regulatory system ... The savings and loan disaster hasbeen extremely costly in terms of dollars and public confidence. Itwas essential that there be new leadership.''   For nearly two months, Wall has been the chief target ofhearings by the House Banking Committee into why federal regulatorsallowed Lincoln to remain open until last April even thoughexaminers had recommended in May 1987 that it be closed. Thebailout of the Irvine, Calif., institution is expected to costtaxpayers up to $2.5 billion.   Wall has maintained there was not enough evidence to seizeLincoln and has dismissed allegations that he declined to actbecause of political pressure from five senators who intervened onbehalf of Lincoln and Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln'sparent company, American Continental Corp.   ``As I testified under oath, neither political influence norLincoln's Charles Keating affected my decision on Lincoln,'' Wallsaid in his resignation letter. ``Nor for that matter have I evermade decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairmanand director.''   Keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in Los Angelesand he is the target of a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suitbrought by federal regulators.   Wall said, ``The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat toshoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various criticsto join in the hue and cry raised by the House Banking Committeechairman for my departure from office.''   Wall testified for 10 hours before Gonzalez's committee in lateNovember. Following Wall's appearance, Gonzalez said of histestimony, ``somehow it rings very hollow to say the hugeregulatory bureaucracy could do nothing, did nothing, as theinstitution (Lincoln) went down.''   Wall said he did not like running from a fight, but he wasunwilling to continue battling his critics at the risk of harmingthe Bush administration.   ``The recent hearings consumed a great deal of our energies aswe prepared our response and the prospect of continued hearingswith me as the primary target would cause disruption at OTS at atime when the agency staff needs to devote its attention torevitalizing the thrift industry,'' Wall said.   Wall was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from July1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulatorof the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new Officeof Thrift Supervision.   Wall's resignation came amid a flood of calls for hisresignation or ouster, among them Gonzalez, Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine; several public interest groups and majornewspapers.   ``Time will indeed be kind to us,'' Wall predicted in atelevision interview Nov. 26, saying that two congressionalinvestigations of the Lincoln collapse would prove his decisionsjustified. In the same interview he conceded making mistakes inhandling the Lincoln case but said he had no plan ``at this point''to resign.   The Senate Ethics Committee is reviewing the conduct of the fivesenators: Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of Arizona, John Glennof Ohio, Alan Cranston of California and Donald Riegle of Michigan,the chairman of the Senate Banking Commitee. McCain is aRepublican, the others Democrats.   Under the Sandamp;L bailout legislation passed in August, Wall's termextends until July 1, 1991. He was chairman of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board and as part of the legislative package was nameddirector of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which replaced thebank board as the regulator of thrifts.   The office is an arm of the Treasury Department.</TEXT></DOC>
