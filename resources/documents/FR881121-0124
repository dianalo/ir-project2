Introduction</ITAG>International markets for securities have grown tremendously in recentyears. The world's markets for equity and debt securities have become increasinglyautomated and linked. Driven by new technology, investors' desires to enterforeign markets, and issuers' efforts to obtain low cost capital, the trendtoward internationalization of the securities markets undoubtedly willcontinue.The challenge facing regulators of these global securities markets is toensure efficiency and honesty. An effective regulatory structure for aninternational securities market system would include the following features:(1) <T3>Efficient structures </T3>for quotation, price, and volume informationdissemination, order routing, order execution, clearance, settlement, andpayment, as well as strong capital adequacy standards;(2) <T3>Sound disclosure systems, </T3>including accounting principles, auditingstandards, auditor independence standards, registration and prospectusprovisions, and listing standards that provide investor protection yetbalance costs and benefits for market participants; and(3) <T3>Fair and honest markets, </T3>achieved through regulation of abusivesales practices, prohibitions against fraudulent conduct, and high levelsof enforcement cooperation.To achieve these objectives, securities regulators in each nation shouldwork closely with their foreign counterparts and seek coordinated internationalsolutions to world market problems. Securities regulators should continueto utilize both bilateral and multilateral relationships in various areas.Cooperative efforts through multilateral organizations, such as the InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions (``IOSCO''), should be continuedand strengthened.In seeking solutions to common problems, securities regulators should besensitive to cultural differences and national sovereignty concerns. Asregulators seek to minimize differences between systems, the goal of investorprotection should be balanced with the need to be responsive to the realitiesof each marketplace.Solutions to the problems posed by internationalization should also bedeveloped with due consideration to the differing approaches to regulationof the varying products in the securities markets, such as stock indexfutures and options. In that regard, both derivative and underlying marketsshould be fair and honest so that wrongdoers cannot do indirectly in onemarket what they are unable to do directly in a related market.Major world markets and their regulators should also assist developingsecurities markets. By helping those markets to become efficient and honest,the developed markets will benefit as participants in the resulting enhancedglobal securities market system.The United States Securities and Exchange Commission believes it has aresponsibility to assume a leadership role in international securitiesregulation. It considers the principles and goals contained in this PolicyStatement to be central to achieving a truly global market system.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. A Structurally Efficient Securities Market System</ITAG>A. Information and Trading SystemsThe international securities market system should feature efficient structuresfor quotation, price, and volume information dissemination concerning securitiesand derivative products traded worldwide. The dissemination of market dataon a real-time basis promotes the efficient operation of capital markets.Presently, quotation, price, and volume information in various nationalsecurities markets often may not be timely, because such information maybe available only at the end of a trading day or at fixed times duringthe day. Such data would be inadequate to support the 24-hour trading activitythat would occur in a global securities market system. World markets andtheir regulators should work with the private sector to improve marketinformation systems so that these systems keep pace with growth in thevolume of international trading. The systems should be fully automatedto achieve the goal of worldwide, real-time information dissemination concerningglobally traded securities and derivative products. Traders then wouldbe able to determine the last sale price, current quotes, and current volumein a security or derivative product on a worldwide basis. Such automated,real-time information systems can be particularly crucial in times of marketvolatility when current information may be necessary to avert panic.Accordingly, the first step in achieving a worldwide securities marketinformation system should be to establish automated market informationsystems in each national market in order to increase efficiency and stability.A second step would be the creation and maintenance of international linkagesbetween the automated information systems of the various national securitiesmarkets. A number of such linkages already exist between major nationalsecurities markets. Ultimately, the development of international consolidatedinformation systems in globally traded securities and derivative productsshould be explored.The international securities market system should also feature efficientstructures for order routing and execution of trades. The key to achievingthis goal will be to create and maintain automated national securitiesmarket routing systems and to improve the various execution systems, whetherthey be open outcry, auction, negotiated, automated, or a combination ofthose systems. The next step would be to establish international linkagesbetween routing and execution systems, such as those already existing betweenseveral major national securities markets.B. Clearance, Settlement, and Payment SystemsIf a truly global securities market is to be achieved, one of the mostimportant international goals should be to establish efficient and comparableautomated national and international clearance, settlement, and paymentsystems. There are wide-ranging differences in dealer and institutionalcomparison periods, settlement periods, and degrees of automation amongvarious equity and debt markets. Ultimately, all countries should establishfully automated clearance and settlement systems that permit paperlessbook entry movement of all broker-dealer and institutional equity and debtpositions. The current lack of coordination among clearance, settlement,and payment sytems in major world securities markets increases the costsand risks of global securities trading.Although comparable systems are not currently in place, it is neverthelessimportant to develop clearing linkages among the major national securitiesmarkets. Linkages provide a current viable means of establishing internationalclearance and settlement because they do not depend upon the existenceof identical, or even comparable, systems in each country. Sound linkagesfacilitate cross-border settlements without compromising the essentialsoundness and integrity of each national clearance and settlement system.For the linkages to be sound, adequate safeguards should exist to reducethe risk of default and to contain potential losses. In the near term,securities regulators should encourage the development of a network ofsound linkages between individual market clearance and settlement systemsto facilitate cross-border settlements. Regulators also should strive toagree upon appropriate minimum standards for these linkages.Notwithstanding the use of clearance and settlement linkages, reductionof differences between the various national clearance and settlement systemsis necessary for creation of a truly global securities market. Accordingly,world markets and their regulators should continue to work towards achievingefficient and compatible systems. A top priority of all markets shouldbe to establish and maintain centralized depository and clearing systems.Concurrently, securities regulators should work together to develop compatibleworldwide standards for clearing entities.C. Financial Responsibilities of Securities FirmsThe multinational character of many large brokerage firms and financialinstitutions has raised regulatory concerns regarding the financial integrityof these entities. Securities regulators worldwide share the goal of preventingdefaults of overseas affiliates from jeopardizing the financial integrityof firms in their own countries.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Financial Information Sharing</ITAG>In the near term, national securities markets and their regulators shouldcontinue to develop bilateral and, if possible, multilateral agreementsfor the sharing of financial information with respect to securities affiliates.This approach recognizes the need for home country regulators to be betterinformed about worldwide securities activities of their regulated securitiesfirms. Regulators thus would be in a better position to respond to internationalevents_either on a firm or market-wide basis_that could have an adverseeffect on the financial and operational condition of the regulated firmin the home country.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Capital Adequacy Standards</ITAG>Varying degrees of regulation exist in different nations regarding broker-dealercapital. Securities regulators should continue to explore the desirabilityof more consistent international capital adequacy standards designed toensure stability and liquidity in national and international markets. Acheivingfull harmonization of capital requirements between banks and non-bank securitiesfirms with regard to their worldwide securities activities is a difficulttask. Efforts nevertheless should continue to harmonize securities firmfinancial responsibility rules in coordination with bank regulatory officialsin order to ensure that mutually agreeable standards for risk-based capitalare established. At a minimum, securities regulators should seek a commonconceptual framework against which non-bank capital adequacy standardscan be measured.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. A Sound Disclosure System</ITAG>Investors participating in the international securities markets shouldbe protected through a sound disclosure system based on mutually agreeableaccounting principles, auditing standards, auditor independence standards,registration and prospectus provisions, and listing standards. The goalin addressing international disclosure and registration problems shouldbe to minimize regulatory impediments without compromising investor protection.Differences in disclosure requirements, accounting principles, auditingstandards, and auditor independence standards between countries are impedimentsto multijurisdictional offerings. Securities regulators should continueto seek ways to accommodate and, to the extent possible, minimize thesedifferences in order to facilitate transnational capital formation, whileensuring adequate disclosure for the protection of investors.As a means of facilitating transnational capital formation and increasingavailable investment opportunities, securities regulators should considermultijurisdictional registration mechanisms whereby issuers can use theirown jurisdiction's disclosure documents for offerings in other countries.The ultimate goal should be the development of an integrated internationaldisclosure system.Efforts should be made to ease restrictions on cross-border sales of investmentcompany shares. Easing restrictions on access by foreign investment companiesto domestic markets can result in increased investment opportunities fordomestic investors. If cross-border sales of investment company sharesare to be facilitated, however, cooperative efforts by securities regulatorsare a necessity. The most promising approach currently seems to be onebased on mutually acceptable standards which are adequate for protectionof investors. accordingly, securities regulators should strive to developand implement bilateral and, if feasible, multilateral agreements for thesale of investment company shares based upon such standards.With regard to the applicability of securities registration requirementsto overseas offerings, a ``territorial approach'' has merit. Under thisapproach, offers or sales of securities occurring outside a country's bordersgenerally would not be subject to that country's registration requirements.Accounting principles, auditing standards, and auditor independence standardsare key factors in determining the feasibility of achieving mutually acceptabledisclosure. A primary impediment to multinational offerings of securitiesis that different countries have different accounting standards. Mutuallyacceptable international accounting standards are a critical goal becausethey will reduce the unnecessary regulatory burdens resulting from currentdisparities between the various national accounting standards. Accordingly,securities regulators and members of the accounting profession throughoutthe world should continue efforts to revise and adjust international accountingstandards with the aim of increasing comparability and reducing costs.Differences in auditing standards and auditor independence standards alsopresent obstacles to achieving a mutually acceptable worldwide disclosureregime. Auditors around the world are subject to different independencestandards, perform different procedures, gather varying amounts of evidenceto support their conclusions, and report the results of their work differently.Accordingly, an important long-term goal should be to establish mutuallyagreeable auditing and auditor independence standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Fair and Honest Markets</ITAG>Regulators should strive to make the world securities market system fairand honest, through regulation of abusive sales practices, prohibitionsagainst fraudulent and manipulative conduct, and high levels of enforcementcooperation. Laws and regulations should promote efficiency and fairnessin the securities markets by prohibiting such acts as insider trading,market manipulation, and misrepresentations to the marketplace. Additionally,securities firms and their personnel should be held to high standards ofcommercial honor and integrity. Securities regulators, including self-regulatoryorganizations, should require securities firms to establish and implementeffective supervisory arrangements to guard against dishonet or abusivesales practices.Investors will seek out markets they perceive as fair and honest. Countriesthat do not have prohibitions against insider trading, market manipulation,and misrepresentations to the marketplace risk becoming havens for illegalactivities. Market abuses result in less efficient markets, higher insuranceand other costs and, most important, the absence from those markets ofindividuals and institutional investors who consider integrity to be anessential market characteristic.As access to international securities markets by brokers, issuers, investmentcompanies, investment advisers, and securiites traders from all countrieshas increased, the need for access by enforcement authorities to informationabout foreign trading activity and the capital raising operations of foreigncompanies has expanded. Pertinent information and evidence regarding suchactivities frequently is located outside of a particular regulator's jurisdiction.Accordingly, securities regulators should continue to forge a network ofbilateral and multilateral surveillance and information sharing arrangementsthat are effective from an enforcement standpoint and sensitive to nationalsovereignty concerns. The major international securities markets shouldbe encouraged to share surveillance information with a view toward ultimateimplementation of a worldwide network of surveillance sharing agreements.Additionally, securities regulators should strive to eliminate the abilityof wrongdoers to shield themselves and their ill-gotten gains from thelaws of the countries in which their wrongdoing occurred or where theirconduct had an impact. Countries should work together to establish formalmechanisms for the enforcement of judgments abroad, as well as for impositionof preliminary judgments freezing a wrongdoer's assets.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Need for International Coordination</ITAG>The ability of securities regulators to address the issues raised by internationalizationof the securities markets will depend greatly upon cooperation among regulators.There can be no doubt that all securities regulators should work togetherdiligently to create sound international regulatory frameworks that willenhance the vitality of capital markets.Securities regulators around the world have already made strides in developingcoordinated responses to important issues. International forums such asIOSCO provide securities regulators with the opportunity to meet with theirinternational counterparts in order to work toward achieving greater cooperation,comparability, and uniformity in areas of particular concern.Although some progress toward the goal of reaching common understandingshas been made, the tasks ahead are complex. Major differences remain amongworld securities market regulatory structures, even among the most maturemarkets. While seeking common solutions to international issues, regulatorsshould also be mindful and respectful of existing national regulatory frameworks.If these national frameworks are to be respected, resolution of internationalsecurites regulation issues requires special effort by all concerned. TheUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission is committed to workingwith securities regulators around the world to achieve the goal of an internationalsecurities market system that is efficient and honest.The views expressed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commissionin this Policy Statement are intended to stimulate thought in a rapidlydeveloping regulatory area and should be regarded as subject to revision.The Commission welcomes comments on these views from all interested persons.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
