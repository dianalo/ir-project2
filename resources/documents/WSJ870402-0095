E.F. Hutton LBO Inc., whose subsidiary, PC Acquisitions Inc., earlier proposed a leveraged buyout of Purolator for $35 a share, extended the expiration date of the $268 million offer to 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday. The bid, which had been accepted by Purolator's board, was scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST today.    Separately, Emery Air Freight Corp. launched a tender offer of $40 a share, or $306 million, for Purolator, a Basking Ridge, N.J.-based package delivery and auto parts concern. Emery is a Wilton, Conn.-based air cargo transportation company.    According to an Emery official, John C. Emery Jr., Emery's chairman, met yesterday with Nicholas F. Brady, Purolator's chairman, to discuss Emery's offer. The Emery official described the meeting as &quot;very cordial.&quot; Purolator officials declined to comment on Emery's offer or on the extension of PC Acquisitions's bid.    Mr. Emery expressed confidence that his company's offer will prevail.    A spokesman for E.F. Hutton LBO, a subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc., said he didn't know whether the group was considering making a higher bid for Purolator. &quot;As far as I know, no decision has been reached,&quot; the spokesman said.    Mike Walker, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore, called Emery's $40-a-share offer &quot;a good price for shareholders. In fact,&quot; he added, &quot;I thought $35 a share was a good price for shareholders.&quot; In 1986, Purolator had a net loss of $57.6 million.    E.F. Hutton LBO said as of Tuesday night, about 880,000 Purolator common shares, or about 11.5% of the total outstanding, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn. The group said it extended the withdrawal-rights period for the tender offer to Tuesday.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Purolator shares rose $5.50 to $40.375 on volume of 625,800 shares. Emery shares closed at $13.50, up 87.5 cents.    Meanwhile, hearings in a New York state court on a request by a group of Purolator shareholders to halt the leveraged-buyout offer were adjourned until Monday. Ralph Ellis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he hadn't seen a copy of the Emery proposal. &quot;After we see it, we'll determine what to do next,&quot; Mr. Ellis said. </TEXT></DOC>
