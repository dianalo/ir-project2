The proposed improvement provides for the constructionof a two-lane facility on new location from Quincy in Lewis County to GreenupDam in Greenup County, a distance of approximately 16 miles. The proposedproject is needed to improve traffic service to a remote area of Kentucky,reduce travel time and distance, improve highway safety and faster economicand industrial development. The facility will be two lanes initially withsufficient right-of-way for four lanes, at a later date. Possible alternatives under consideration include the (1) do-nothing, (2)project postponement and (3) the build alternative. The build alignment begins near KY 1021, South of Quincy, Lewis Countyand proceeds in a southeasterly direction, paralleling KY 1021 for morethan a mile. The alignment turns to the northeast and crosses into GreenupCounty. At this point, the alignment parallels existing KY 734 to a pointnear Letitia. The alignment turns to the east, crosses Beauty Ridge toBeechy Creek and continues to Tygarts Valley. The alignment crosses TygartsCreek before ending at US 23 and the Greenup Dam Bridge, a distance ofapproximately 16 miles.
