But it isn't clear, based on the track record of some recently restructured companies, that the trend promises greater efficiency or improved management. While some past mergers and buy-outs have yielded improved results, the consolidation wave in other cases has hampered research and development, or failed to solve management or marketing problems.    In the past four years alone, five transactions valued from $2.71 billion to $6.2 billion have been completed: Beatrice Cos.' merger with Esmark Inc., Nestle S.A.'s purchase of Carnation Co., Philip Morris's acquisition of General Foods Corp., RJR's purchase of Nabisco Brands Inc., and Beatrice's own LBO.    At least two big deals now pending -- Grand Metropolitan PLC's offer for Pillsbury Co. and Philip Morris Cos.'s bid for Kraft Inc. -- would greatly increase concentration in the industry. A third, RJR Nabisco Inc.'s proposed leveraged buy-out, would further restructure the business.    But past transactions have had a mixed track record, at best. In a few cases, such as Nestle's acquisition of Carnation, the food company apparently benefited, with an infusion of much-needed capital and management. But in others, notably Philip Morris's 1985 acquisition of General Foods and Beatrice's leveraged buy-out the same year, little benefit in terms of greater efficiency or improved management seems to have resulted.    Following the Beatrice LBO, Beatrice was saddled with a big debt load, which depressed profits and made the company more vulnerable to an economic downturn. Management upheaval hurt morale and slowed marketing momentum. Productivity suffered.    Massive restructuring and divestitures at Beatrice eliminated more than 20,000 jobs following the merger with Esmark. Profits plunged despite sales gains, and improved results for ethnic foods proved elusive. Managers were distracted by what one called &quot;the feeling we have to pay off debt and pay it off fast. We have to slam these two companies together.&quot;    Similarly, analysts say that while Philip Morris boosted General Foods' returns as it pumped in $1.4 billion in capital improvements, critical problems remain at the food giant three years later, including lackluster profit growth and some sluggish brands. Nor did the tobacco parent do much to bolster General Foods' management.    However, acquisition helped Carnation immeasurably, says June Page, who follows the food industry for Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;It has improved profitability significantly since Nestle took over,&quot; she says. &quot;Carnation had a very average management. Its attention had been diverted. Nestle is a bottom-line company, very efficient, very Swiss.&quot; Ms. Page says Nestle instituted numerous low-cost production measures and funded research and development.    Many food companies have already streamlined their operations in recent years, leaving little cost-cutting to be done. And some experts see little advantage to combining research and development efforts. Typically, new-product innovation declines in the event of large food-company mergers, says John M. Connor, a Purdue University professor who has written a book on the food processing industry.    While companies tend to consolidate Randamp;D operations in hopes of achieving greater efficiency, the effort often fails, he says. &quot;Uprooting an Randamp;D facility would be like moving Purdue (University) to Chicago,&quot; he says. &quot;The disruption would be long-term in its impact.&quot;    A major exception, analysts say, is in the food-service business, which distributes products to institutions and restaurants. Giant food companies have moved aggressively into this area in recent years, and mergers may achieve significant economies of scale. As the second-largest food-service distributor, for instance, a combined Kraft-General Foods would have enormous ability to distribute all its products cheaply to institutional customers.    Meanwhile, the restructuring is virtually wiping out &quot;pure food plays&quot; for investors, leaving instead a single consumer-products industry with a core of dominant food brands that complement such non-food items as apparel, liquor and tobacco.    Analysts think food companies are vulnerable to takeovers partly because of the enormous market potential of their established brands. With huge amounts of cash and sophisticated marketing techniques honed in selling other branded merchandise, suitors such as Philip Morris and Grand Metropolitan think they've found a natural way to expand internationally. Their goal is to have consumers in places such as Indonesia and Spain sit down to dinner with Green Giant, Burger King and Velveeta, as consumers do in the U.S.    &quot;Wall Street has missed how valuable brands really are and how much growth they can give you,&quot; says Ms. Page of Bear Stearns. &quot;They can sell cereal as well in France as in Iowa now.&quot; The planned elimination in 1992 of trade barriers between European Community nations is an added incentive to establish an international market presence.    Says Craig Carver, of Dain, Bosworth andamp; Co in Minneapolis: &quot;You'll see the industry -- what's left of it -- moving very rapidly into international markets.&quot; He adds: &quot;What else is left to do in the U.S.?&quot;    ---   Joann S.
