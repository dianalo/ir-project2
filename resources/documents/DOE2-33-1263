Inorder to clarify whether the patient could tolerate carotid occlusion,a ballon clamping test was performed before surgery. The cerebral bloodflow was measured using early imaging by single photon emission computedtomography (SPECT) with N-isopropyl-(iodine-123)-p-iodoamphetamine (/sup123/I-IMP). When the ballon clamping test was performed the tracer wasinjected, and scanning was performed 35 minutes after removing the catheter.This tracer enabled a 'memory of blood flow' during temporary ischemiato determine the character of quick diffusion and slow wash out, thatcould not be performed by other methods of cerebral blood flow measurement.SPECT with /sup 123/I-IMP can simplify the measurement of cerebral bloodflow during the balloon clamping test.</TEXT></DOC>
