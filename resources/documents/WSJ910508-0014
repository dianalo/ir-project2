The bill also bolsters the shrinking bank depositinsurance fund with increased borrowing authority, imposesnew auditing standards on thousands of banks and, starting in1995, bars the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fromprotecting accounts that exceed the current $100,000. Thisprovision would end the so-called &quot;too big to fail doctrine&quot;under which the FDIC insures all accounts, including thoseoutside the umbrella of federal insurance.</LP><TEXT>   By its 34-1 vote approving the bill, the FinancialInstitutions Subcommittee took the first step towardcomprehensive reform of the banking system. Next week, itwill begin considering a broader Bush administration proposalto allow banks to operate nationwide branch systems,affiliate with securities brokerage and other financialservices firms, and to be owned by commercial companies.   Parts of the administration bill are highly controversialand will face tough going, both in the subcommittee and laterin the full banking committee. The administration argues thatbanks need more flexibility to expand the services they offerin order to compete effectively and profitably withsecurities firms, finance companies, and others that havelured traditional customers away from banks.   When the full committee takes up the bill the subcommitteeapproved, it is likely to make changes. Both the Treasury andthe Federal Reserve Board argue that the decision to end thetoo-big-to-fail doctrine could lead to dangerous disruptionsin the banking system.   The Treasury and the Fed say they need the flexibility toprotect uninsured depositors -- including foreign depositors,accounts held by correspondent banks, and accounts of morethan $100,000 held by businesses, state and local governmentsand wealthy individuals -- to prevent the failure of a largebank from triggering a loss of confidence in the bankingsystem.   But in the past year, the FDIC's decision to protect alldepositors in large institutions -- such as the Bank of NewEngland -- while allowing losses on large depositors in smallbanks -- such as New York's Freedom National Bank -- hashighlighted the unfairness of the too-big-to-fail doctrine.   The subcommittee voted down an amendment that would haveallowed regulators to continue the too-big-to-fail policyunder very limited conditions.   The bill the subcommittee approved is designed to augmentthe Bank Insurance Fund and to limit sharply future fundlosses by toughening bank regulation and requiring promptcorrective action -- such as dividend suspensions, managementchanges and growth restrictions -- to address problems attroubled banks.   The panel voted to expand the fund's current line ofcredit from the Treasury to $30 billion from $5 billion andto increase its ability to borrow from other sources. Thebill authorizes the FDIC to impose special assessments ondepository institutions to repay the borrowings. The specialassessment provision was a defeat for banks, which wantlimits on the FDIC's authority to impose premium increases.   Although some of the regulatory provisions were softenedto meet banking industry and Treasury objections, the billcontains major changes. These include:   -- Annual on-site examinations of federally insured banksby federal regulators. Currently, only the Federal Reserveperforms annual examinations; the FDIC and the Comptroller ofthe Currency don't have enough examiners to visit every bankthey supervise.   -- Annual audits by independent accountants of all bankswith assets of more than $150 million.   -- A requirement that banks disclose the market value oftheir assets and liabilities. The panel backed away from aprovision that would have pressed regulators to requiremarket-value accounting -- a practice many banks and theTreasury claim would be costly and unworkable -- in financialstatements.   -- Provisions that would require regulators to actpromptly to correct deficiencies as bank capital declines. Tominimize losses to the deposit insurance fund, the billrequires the FDIC to close banks when their capital reaches2% of assets, rather than wait until the institutions arecompletely insolvent.   A Senate bill introduced by Senate Banking CommitteeChairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) contains many similarcorrective measures.   The House panel made one important change in its bill inresponse to objections from the Fed. As originally introducedby full committee chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) andsubcommittee chairman Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), the billwould have restricted the Fed's authority to help poorlycapitalized banks with discount window loans. The paneldropped this provision after the Fed complained that theprovision could interfere with its efforts to head offdisruptions to the banking system.</TEXT></DOC>
