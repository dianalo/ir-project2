In fact, the significance ofsuch a purchase on stock-footage companies -- which deal inmotion-picture images rather than still photos -- may be muchgreater.   In addition to its photo library, Image Bank also has oneof the largest collections of stock motion-picture footage inthe world. It's only a matter of time before the same digitaltechnology that threatens the livelihood of still-photocompanies is applied to the motion-picture process. Just asan entire library of still images could be placed on compactdiscs, so too could pristine digital depictions of stockmotion-picture images be copied, distributed and potentiallypirated.</LP><TEXT>   A boycott of Kodak film by stock-footage companies wouldhave even more far-reaching consequences than one bystock-photo houses: While a still-photo company mightpurchase $15,000 to $20,000 annually in Kodak products, thetypical stock-footage production company might purchase inthe hundreds of thousands of dollars during the same period.   It is ironic that Kodak, a company that has always assuredits customers that it had no intention of competing withthem, has now taken steps to compete with some of its oldestand most loyal clients.
