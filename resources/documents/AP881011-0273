In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kroger stockfell $2.62{ a share to $55, far below Kohlberg's cash-and-stockoffer that was valued at $64 a share.   In a letter to Kroger, Kohlberg said: ``While we are perplexedthat the board found our proposal to acquire the company ... at 28times earnings to be inadequate, we were not even asked if we werein a position to improve our offer. We can only conclude that theboard has decided that the company is not for sale at any price.''   Kohlberg said it did not anticipate making any further proposals.   Paul Bernish, a spokesman at Kroger's headquarters inCincinnati, had no comment except to note that the company wasproceeding with its previously announced restructuring plan.   Bidding for Kroger began last month when Maryland's Haft familyoffered to acquire the big supermarket chain for $55 a share.Kohlberg came on the scene with a $58.50-a-share offer but lastweek sweetened the proposal to $64 a share.   Although financial analysts had said Kroger managers might bepressured to accept Kohlberg's latest offer, the company's boarddenounced the proposal last week as inadequate and put itsrestructuring plan in motion by laying off 300 employees. Krogeralso has announced plans to sell off certain assets.   Analysts speculated Kohlberg bowed out of the contest becausethe aggressive New York buyout firm did not want to proceed in ahostile manner and launch a tender offer.   ``It would hurt their image of being a white knight and adefender of management,'' said Kimberly Walin, an analyst atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Kohlberg rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover, inpart because the success of its deals typically depends on havingexisting management remain with the target company.   But analysts also were not convinced that Kohlberg was entirelyout of the picture.   ``It's possible that if something negative develops, that KKRmight be able to come back with a lower offer,'' said Linda Morris,a retail analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.   She suggested Kohlberg might be waiting in the wings to see ifany new lawsuits surfaced that charge the Kroger board withbreaching its fiduciary duties for failing to negotiate the bestprice for shareholders.   At least four shareholders' suits already were filed againstKroger contending that the restructuring plan was not inshareholders' best interests.   Kroger valued its restructuring at between $57 and $61 a share,but Kohlberg challenged those figures, noting that the financialcommunity had put a pricetag of between $53 to $56 a share on theplan.   Under terms of the restructuring, Kroger would distribute aspecial dividend of $40 in cash plus notes and stock for eachKroger share.   Disagreements over the value of the plan centered on a ``stub''share of stock that Kroger officials estimated would trade atbetween $9 and $13 a share. Wall Street investors, however,estimated the stub's value as low as $5 a share.   Analysts discounted the effect Kohlberg's withdrawal might haveon the Haft bid. The Hafts, who control Dart Group Corp. and have areputation as corporate raiders, ``still have their fingers in thepie ... but I'd be surprised if they were serious,'' Morris said.   Furthermore, after rejecting the Kohlberg bid as inadequate, itwould be difficult for Kroger to look favorably upon the Haftproposal, which was considered inferior by the investment community.   The Hafts offered last week to help Kroger fight the Kohlbergbid by proposing to provide additional equity for Kroger'srestructuring.   Dart Group President Robert Haft reiterated Tuesday that thefamily ``remains interested in working with Kroger to strengthenthe company and enhance their restructuring by providing additionalequity.''   He declined to comment on whether the Haft bid has beenwithdrawn. But representatives of the Haft family ``had contact''with Kroger management last week about remaining involved with thecompany, a source said.   The 105-year-old Kroger has 170,000 employees and 52,000shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarketsand convenience stores. Kroger operates more than 1,300supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehousesin 29 states.</TEXT></DOC>
