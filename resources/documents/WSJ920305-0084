The Dean Witter firm has played up its historical tie tothe founding Witter family in TV ads featuring an actorportraying the original Mr. Witter. But a Dean Witterspokeswoman yesterday distanced the firm from the arrest ofDavid Witter. &quot;He has no connection with the company. He hasnever been an employee. We don't have anything to say aboutit,&quot; she said.   David Witter faces a maximum jail sentence of 20 years anda fine of $500,000, or up to $500,000 for each count, saidRobert C.

The tale is a far cry from the story of the familypatriarch, who died in 1969. Dean Witter, along with tworelatives, started a securities firm with $250,000 in 1924 inSan Francisco. This blossomed into a financial servicesempire, the Dean Witter Financial Services Group, which made$4.9 billion in revenue in 1991.
