Authoritiessaid he surrendered late Tuesday afternoon, but it was expected he would beable to post the $50,000 bail.;   Authorities contend DeDomenico tried toevade paying state taxes by saying he was living in Nevada at the time of thesale of his family's companies.;   His tax return indicated he left Californiain July 1986 and that his official residence was Verdi, Nev., said SacramentoCounty Deputy District Attorney Ana Bravo.;   But investigators later found hehad only a post office box on July 9, a driver's license three weeks later andno electricity in his Verdi apartment until the end of August.;   That sameyear, DeDomenico paid $2.75 million for the 100-room Carolands mansion, siteof a grisly murder the year before.;   Ironically, DeDomenico's surrender cameon the same day that the sprawling chateau was opened to the public to begin amonthlong run dressed up to the nines as a designer's showcase fund-raiser.The stately mansion is on the market for a reputed $20 million.;   Tipped byphone call; Tax officials would not have suspected anything but for ananonymous phone caller who said DeDomenico was bragging about pulling off the$1.5 million coup, Bravo said.;   He panicked after authorities wrote to himasking him to come and talk about the tax return, Bravo said. &quot;He goes to theapartment manager and asks her to falsify new documents -- and pays her $485to backdate (his rent receipts) to June 1,&quot; Bravo said.;   Investigators,following DeDomenico's paper trail, including his utility records, couldn'tget anything to add up. When they talked to the apartment manager, she brokedown and admitted what had happened, Bravo said.;   The $485 was equivalent toa month's rent, Bravo said.;   If DeDomenico is convicted of tax fraud,reportedly the largest single case of evasion in a single year, he will haveto pay the original taxes plus interest and fines totaling $3.8 million, Bravosaid. He could also be sentenced to three years in prison.;   DeDomenico, whoalso owns homes in Incline Village, Nev., and Herald, Calif., owns between 25and 30 properties in Verdi, Bravo said.
