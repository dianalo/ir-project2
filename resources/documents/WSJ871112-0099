In a speech delivered in New York, David Ruder said he believes the SEC should support a definition of the crime that covers not only insider trading by corporate employees, but trading by other people who misappropriate inside information for their own benefit. The text of Mr. Ruder's remarks was released here.    Separately, in a speech in London yesterday, SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, differing with many market analysts, said that portfolio insurance and the futures markets shouldn't be blamed for the Oct. 19 crash.    Reacting to Mr. Ruder's speech, Theodore Levine, a Washington securities lawyer, said he found the comments on insider trading most significant as a sign that the SEC wants to see legislation enacted that would formally define insider trading. Proponents of such a bill say a statutory definition would clarify the law and strengthen the SEC's enforcement program.    The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on securities is considering a bill defining insider trading that was drafted for it by three Washington attorneys. But, until just a few months ago, the SEC was telling Congress a definition wasn't necessary. Mr. Ruder's speech &quot;means the prospects for coming up with a viable definition are quite good,&quot; said lawyer Harvey Pitt, who along with Mr. Levine helped write the bill. The SEC's formal comments on the bill are expected soon.    Nonetheless, even if passed by the Senate, such legislation faces big hurdles in getting through Congress. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the powerful chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, repeatedly has expressed reservations about fixing a specific definition of insider trading.    In his speech, to the National Investor Relations Institute, Mr. Ruder also said the SEC is continuing to aggressively pursue insider trading cases. &quot;You may rest assured that (the agency) will bring additional enforcement actions if its investigation reveals that violations have occurred,&quot; he said.    One congressional aide interpreted that remark to mean that the SEC has taken &quot;a step backward&quot; from more forceful statements earlier this year about progress in its investigation of Wall Street's insider-trading scandals. In May, for example, John Shad, Mr. Ruder's predecessor as SEC chairman, testified before Congress that, &quot;I think you will see a succession of shoes dropping through this summer.&quot; However, no significant actions related to the Wall Street scandals have been brought since that statement was made.    But Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said Mr. Ruder's comment shouldn't be interpreted to mean that the agency is backing away. He added: &quot;Some additional actions will be brought. Whether or not they'll involve insider trading, I really can't say at this point.&quot;    In his speech in London, SEC Commissioner Grundfest, who has a reputation as a dedicated free-marketer, criticized &quot;the popular allegation&quot; that portfolio insurance contributed to the Oct. 19 market crash. An advance copy of Mr. Grundfest's speech was released in Washington. He noted that the market crashed in 1929 without program trading, and that last month the markets in Tokyo and London declined rapidly even though program trading isn't as widely used overseas as it is in the U.S.    Portfolio insurance is a computerized hedging strategy. Program trading is a form of computerized arbitrage in which securities firms carry out blizzards of trades to capitalize on price gaps between stocks and the stock index futures market.    Thus, Mr. Grundfest concluded, &quot;even if futures markets didn't exist, and even if portfolio insurance as we know it today were banned, the markets could have experienced precisely the same decline that they suffered on Oct. 19.&quot;    Mr. Grundfest's comments on the futures market appear to place him in partial opposition to Mr. Ruder, who seems more inclined toward regulation in that area. Last week, the SEC chairman testified before the Senate Banking Committee that his &quot;preliminary judgment&quot; was that trading in stock-index futures did in fact contribute to the stock market's volatility last month. </TEXT></DOC>
