In the quarter ended Dec. 31, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 470 major corporations fell 7% from a year earlier, a Wall Street Journal survey finds. Net income eased only 1%, contrasted with a 7% rise in the third quarter, a 5% drop in the second and a 2% slide in the first.    The new tax law canceled the investment tax credit, effective Jan. 1, 1986, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board told companies to take the full hit in the fourth quarter. Although the effect varied widely among various industries and even within the same industry, the Commerce Department estimated that elimination of the credit and other changes cut overall fourth-quarter net income by $11.2 billion on an annual basis.    Looking ahead, most analysts expect strong gains in profits this year, though the new tax law, with its tighter depreciation rules, may help to get the year off to a slow start. Kurt Brown, an economist at Data Resources Inc., a consulting firm, cites taxes as one reason he expects first-quarter profits to trail the fourth-quarter level while remaining above a year ago.    The wave of corporate restructuring is noted by many forecasters who expect profits for the full year to top those in 1986. Analysts are generally anticipating another year of sluggish economic growth, with inflation-adjusted gross national product rising 2.5% or less. But the 50 economists surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, predict, on the average, that pre-tax profits this year will rise 8.4%, up from an estimated 5.9% year-to-year gain in 1986. Allen Sinai, a Shearson Lehman Brothers economist, says costs have been cut so much that &quot;any increase in sales will be highly leveraged into higher earnings.&quot;    Securities analysts at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. think that the huge write-offs, which have helped hold down reported earnings in the past two years, are now largely out of the way. They contend that this fact alone will make profits look better this year.    In the just-ended quarter, many major industries posted lackluster results, although in some cases operating gains were obscured by huge special charges or problems at one company. The auto industry's results, for example, were dragged down by a poor performance at General Motors, and improvements in the tire industry were swamped by a big charge at Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber. The office-equipment group suffered from a slump at International Business Machines, fierce competition and restructuring charges. The telephone group's showing was marred by huge charges at the long-distance carriers. Oil companies took a beating, dragging oil-service concerns down with them, and the steel group fell deeper into red ink.    However, several industrial groups rebounded to profitability. Chemical companies were back in the black after taking huge restructuring charges in the 1985 fourth period. Airlines were helped by cheaper fuel, insurers benefited from improvements in some troubled lines, and even the struggling nonferrous metals industry earned an overall profit.    The weak dollar aided a number of industries, including drug makers, food processors and forest-products companies, which had increased exports. Lower interest rates helped home builders and makers of building materials. The electrical-equipment group posted a surge in net income with the aid of one-time gains.    Here are the fourth-quarter earnings for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000 has been omitted.    AEROSPACE   Earnings continued to suffer from the Pentagon's clampdown on profit margins and the general-aviation slump. General Dynamics' net loss of $326.1 million included a $420.2 million write-off for its Cessna general-aviation unit. United Technologies' $228 million loss included a $346.7 million charge for restructuring, including layoffs in some defense units. Northrop's 68% drop in net was due partly to a $105.3 million write-off to close out its investment in the F-20 jet, which it couldn't sell. Grumman's net increased 7%, but operating profit in its aerospace segment declined because of higher-than-expected costs on a Navy jet program and the phase-out of an Air Force jet. Rockwell International's net included a $28.5 million gain from a pension-accounting change. The new tax law had a varied impact. McDonnell Douglas's 2% drop in net reflected $28.3 million in additional taxes. The company also posted a $14.6 million gain on real-estate sales. But at Lockheed, repeal of the investment tax credit was offset by research-related tax credits. Lockheed attributed its profit drop to higher costs of modifying military and commercial aircraft and to interest costs from debt incurred in acquiring Sanders Associates. Boeing's net was helped by a $19 million research tax credit. For 1987, Boeing projected a 10% decline in sales, blaming lower commercial-aircraft volume and a transition to higher-cost military programs. Howard J. Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence, expects 1987 profits at Lockheed and Northrop to reflect similar high-cost &quot;transition years,&quot; but he sees higher earnings at General Dynamics.                                4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    11 Firms                     1986         1985      Chg    Boeing Co                  191,000     188,000    +   2    General Dynamics          -326,100      90,400      ...

Delta Air Lines' surge in net income to $125.5million in its Dec. 31 second quarter was enhanced by a $50.8million gain from aircraft sales; the carrier's fuel expensesfell 42% from a year earlier. AMR Corp., American Airlines'parent, reported a 73% drop in fourth-quarter net as a resultof the new law on investment tax credits; AMR's pre-taxprofit more than doubled to $86.9 million. Texas Air'sContinental Airlines unit earned $23.3 million, whichincluded a $15 million special gain; the year-earlier quarterincluded about $24 million in charges related toContinental's earlier bankruptcy-law filing. Aided by a 7.3%decrease in operating expenses, Eastern (now also owned byTexas Air) earned $6 million, against a year-earlier loss of$67.5 million. UAL Inc., United Airlines' parent, had a $13.6million loss; UAL noted that fare wars offset 48% growth inUnited's traffic. Trans World Airlines posted its firstfourth-quarter profit in years, but only because of a $134.6million pre-tax gain from sale of a 50% stake in itsreservation system; TWA also was helped by cost controls.Analysts say the latest round of fare discounting may hurtthe seasonally slow first quarter.                               4th Qtr     4th Qtr       %    7 Firms                      1986        1985       Chg    AMR Corp                     6,569      24,410    -  73    Delta Air Lines            125,510       1,888    +6548    Piedmont Aviation           17,502      16,045    +   9    Texas Air                   21,735     -31,599      ...

Chrysler's results included a $144.3 million pre-taxgain on sale of its interest in Peugeot S.A. of France.General Motors' profit performance echoed the No. 1 automaker's array of troubles, including increased costs andslower sales. GM's net was hurt by a $1.22 billion chargerelated to plant closings and other moves to improveefficiency. GM didn't pay any 1986 federal income taxes and,instead, received a $300.3 million tax credit related to poorearnings and special charges for facilities scheduled to beclosed; GM also got a $330 million lift from apension-accounting change. Ford says loss of investment taxcredits under the new tax law cut its fourth-quarter net byabout $116 million; Chrysler's net was similarly reduced $60million. GM accounts for such credits under a differentmethod and wasn't affected the same way. Many industryofficials and securities analysts expect a moderate declinein car sales this year, reducing year-to-year profitcomparisons for some auto makers -- perhaps beginning thisquarter. But they expect the Big Three to maintain theirprofit positions relative to one another for a while. Ford,for instance, has scheduled production increases for thecurrent quarter versus a year ago, while GM is planning cuts.As a result, analysts predict, Ford probably will earn morethan $1 billion, up from $723.8 million in the year-earlierquarter, while some analysts expect GM to earn $500 millionto $600 million, down from $1.06 billion. Some expectChrysler, which will idle some plants for conversion to newmodels for part of the period, to report profits below $300million, against $357 million a year ago.                                4th Qtr     4th Qtr       %    10 Firms                     1986         1985       Chg    Champion Spk Plg             1,500       1,500        0    Chrysler Corp              323,600     215,000    +  51    Cummins Engine               2,458      15,575    -  84    Dana Corp                      100      29,600    -  99    Ford Motor                 785,000     720,000    +   9    General Motors             382,000   1,252,000    -  69    Mack Trucks                  6,747      -2,994      ...

Many banks posted nonrecurring gains from the sale ofreal estate and venture-capital assets and benefited fromlower tax rates on income from leveraged leases. For example,First Chicago Corp.'s earnings surged partly because of gainson its venture-capital investments and leasing business. J.P.Morgan's net was damped by a $38.2 million loss from disposalof loans to small debt-troubled nations. At ManufacturersHanover Corp., a $33.5 million charge to buy back debtsecurities depressed earnings; the company also realized anaftertax gain of $29.3 million from the sale of Manhattanreal estate. Security Pacific Corp.'s noninterest incomeincluded pre-tax gains of about $18 million from the sale ofa mortgage unit and about $17 million from the recentacquisition of an Arizona bank. In Texas, deterioratingenergy and real-estate loans caused heavy losses or sharpdeclines in bank earnings. A jump in credit losses andadditions to loan-loss reserves battered earnings at MellonBank Corp. And at troubled BankAmerica Corp., a $236 millionnet gain from the sale of an Italian unit offset an operatingdeficit. Mark Alpert, bank analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.,says, &quot;It's going to be difficult for banks to achieve thelevel of nonrecurring gains they did in 1986.&quot;                               4th Qtr     4th Qtr        %    25 Firms                     1986        1985        Chg    Bank of Boston              64,800      43,800    +  48    Bank of New York            38,450      33,572    +  15    BankAmerica                 82,000    -178,000      ...

Sales of land and assets added $29.2million to Hercules's net. Du Pont blamed falling prices forits lower earnings, and Monsanto, though back in the black,complained of weaker sales of farm chemicals and itsNutraSweet artificial sweetener. Sano Shimado, an analyst atAnantha Raman andamp; Co., expects first-quarter earnings toimprove as chemical output increases.                               4th Qtr     4th Qtr        %    20 Firms                     1986        1985        Chg    Air Pdts andamp; Chem             35,375      34,407    +   3    American Cyanamid           52,100      10,500    + 396    Celanese Corp               57,000      50,000    +  14    Dow Chemical               168,000    -314,000      ...

DRUG MAKERS   The weakening of the dollar against some foreigncurrencies helped propel strong earnings growth. Companiesalso were aided, analysts say, by prescription-drug priceincreases of about 8% last year and by continuingconsolidation of operations and staff reductions. Pfizer'sprofit, for instance, rose 14% partly because the lowerdollar lifted sales growth to 10% from 6%. Earnings at bothMerck and Upjohn increased 28% because of sales of new,big-selling prescription drugs. Schering-Plough's earningssurged 76% as a result of new products and a newly acquiredunit, Key Pharmaceuticals. Warner-Lambert and Sterling postedprofits, against losses due to one-time charges a yearearlier. Despite forecasts of no growth in unit sales ofprescription drugs, analysts see profits up 10% to 15% thisyear because of expected marketing of new, albeit often &quot;metoo,&quot; products.                               4th Qtr     4th Qtr        %    14 Firms                     1986       1985         Chg    Abbott Labs                160,598     141,401    +  14    Am Home Pdts               199,370     183,727    +   9    Bristol-Myers              151,702     122,176    +  24    Eli Lilly andamp; Co             124,300     124,500        0    Johnson andamp; Johnson           96,500     127,700    -  24    Merck andamp; Co                 171,800     134,400    +  28    Pfizer Inc                 158,400     139,300    +  14    Robins A H Co               26,161      13,464    +  94    Rorer Group                 -6,286       8,961      ...

The near-term outlook is weak. TRW, which had a $28.8million loss in the 1985 fourth period because ofrestructuring, sees a first-half profit drop but double-digitgrowth in 1987 net income. Intel hopes to break even in thecurrent quarter. But Westinghouse Electric sees &quot;another yearof limited economic growth&quot; generally. Fourth-quarter netmore than doubled at AMP, M/A-Com, Penn Central and VarianAssociates, but the companies were aided by gains from assetsales or pension changes.

Quaker Oats says its144% increase in profits included results of threeacquisitions, a $55.8 million gain from the sale ofdiscontinued operations and a $20.9 million plant-closingcharge. Kraft's profit drop reflects the spinoff of certainnon-food businesses; the company also had a $4.6 million gainfrom a change in pension accounting.

CPC Internationalsays its profit increased partly because 60% of its sales arein foreign operations and thus benefited from the weakerdollar.

HOME BUILDERS   Buoyed by low mortgage-interest rates, the big homebuilders reported profits. U.S. Home, of Houston, recordedone of its most profitable quarters since 1983, with the aidof a largely completed restructuring program. The profitwould have been greater, the company says, but additionalreserves of $6.4 million were established in connection withits disposal of mobile-home assets. Pittsburgh-based RyanHomes says its net was reduced $2.6 million as a result ofexpenses related to a tender offer from N.V. Homes. PulteHome, of Detroit, increased its provision for foreclosurelosses in its mortgage-banking operation, which felt theeffects of soft markets in Texas and Colorado.

Caterpillar blamed its loss on a $109million pre-tax charge for planned plant closings as well ascontinued price discounting and weak demand for largemachines. Its year-earlier pre-tax profit was hurt by $26million in plant consolidation and early-retirement charges.At Deere, a five-month strike and the continuingfarm-equipment slump inflicted a record quarterly deficit.Federal Mogul's loss was due to a net charge of $24 millionfor restructuring facilities; the year-earlier profitincluded a $7.3 million gain from the sale of facilities.Costs for selling or trimming some Allis-Chalmers operationscontributed to the company's deficit; its year-earlier profitwas after a $7.7 million loss from discontinued operations.Huge interest costs for Colt Industries' recapitalizationhammered down its earnings. Colt's 1985 fourth-quarter netincluded a $4.3 million loss from discontinued operations.The flight of U.S. production overseas and the collapse ofthe energy market pummeled industrial-equipment volume,analysts say. The slump will produce a first-quarter deficitof $25 million to $50 million at Caterpillar, and Deere lostabout $200 million in its Jan. 31 first quarter, analystsestimate.                               4th Qtr      4th Qtr       %    14 Firms                     1986         1985      Chg    Allis-Chalmers              -5,756         511      ...

INSURANCE   Improving commercial property and casualty business liftedoperating results. In addition, capital gains on investmentssignificantly aided several insurers. And tax-losscarry-forwards helped Aetna and Travelers. The dramaticadvances at Cigna and Continental primarily reflected specialaddtions to commercial property and casualty loss reservesthat the two companies posted in the final quarter of 1985;in that period, Cigna took a charge of $1.2 billion andContinental $220 million. There weren't any reserveadjustments that big in the latest quarter, althoughTravelers says its personal property and casualty businesshad a $24.9 million operating loss because of reserveadditions. Analysts expect insurers with largeproperty-casualty operations to report year-to-year gains inoperating results at least throughout 1987, as priceincreases for commercial insurance continue to work their wayto the bottom line.                              4th Qtr      4th Qtr        %    9 Firms                     1986         1985       Chg    Aetna Life andamp; Cas           284,900     146,800    +  94    CIGNA Corp                 317,100    -938,800      ...

MEDIA andamp; ENTERTAINMENT   Many media and entertainment companies' results werehelped or hurt by extraordinary items and nonrecurringcharges. Because companies in the group are mainly serviceconcerns, most are expected to benefit in coming quartersfrom lower corporate tax rates stemming from last year'stax-code overhaul. At CBS, net income soared mainly becauseof a $187.7 million gain from the sale of the book-publishingoperations. Walt Disney's profit more than doubled onstronger-than-expected earnings from its theme parks andother operations. But MCA's net plunged after the company,concerned about slowing sales of television programming andTV-station financial troubles, reduced its estimate of incomefrom the sale of TV series and increased its bad-debt reservefor accounts receivable from stations that buy such series.Taft Broadcasting reported a deficit for its fiscal thirdquarter because of losses on the pending sale of its fiveindependent TV stations.

IBM benefited somewhat from the decline in thedollar but took charges estimated by analysts at $400 millionto $425 million because of cost-cutting moves.

Xerox had a $21million gain because of the new tax law, but its comparisonsuffered from a $51 million charge in the latest period and ayear-earlier gain of $42 million. Apple Computer, though nottaking any charges, had only a small profit gain because ofhigher spending associated with new products. DigitalEquipment was the stellar performer because of its computers'facility in communicating with each other, and that strengthis likely to continue.

PETROLEUM   Fourth-quarter results were depressed, and the outlook forearly 1987 isn't much better. Low oil and natural-gas pricescontinued to erode profits from exploration and production.Simultaneously, demand for refined products wasdisappointing, and the resulting inventory surplus hurt thecompanies' refining and marketing operations. With crude-oilprices up a bit in recent weeks, some oil-company executivessay the worst is behind them. But with product inventoriesstill very high, analysts doubt that earnings will strengthenmuch in the next few months. Reflecting industry sentiment,James W. Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive, says, &quot;The recentfirming of oil prices provides a basis for some cautiousoptimism that there will be a more stable marketplace in1987.&quot; Tosco's 401% increase in net stemmed from a one-timegain from debt refinancing; without it, Tosco would have beenin the red.

Excluding special items, Santa Fesays its earnings from continuing operations fell 19% becauseof a higher effective tax rate. CSX posted a 10% increase inearnings after excluding its $954 million pre-tax charge in1985. The company attributed the gain to improvements in itsnatural-gas pipeline business, the sale of mineral propertiesand dividends received from another company.

One indication is the 7% profit drop for themerchandise group of Sears Roebuck, which operates on acalendar year. Dayton Hudson sees lower profits partlybecause of costs associated with changing the merchandise mixof its struggling Mervyn's chain.

The fees stemmed largely frommergers and acquisitions business; many corporations soldassets or businesses before the end of the year to benefitfrom the favorable tax treatment of capital gains under theold tax law. Merrill Lynch's 192% earnings increase waspartly due to a $105.2 million gain from the sale of itsequipment-leasing unit. In contrast, E.F. Hutton Group took a$130 million charge, largely as a provision for potentiallosses on securities that it is buying back from retailcustomers; Hutton says it thinks that it marketed thesecurities improperly. Last year's first quarter was a recordfor securities-industry profitability, so &quot;looking for 'up'comparisons is overly optimistic,&quot; says Samuel G. Liss, aSalomon Brothers analyst. He adds, however, that MerrillLynch may top its year-ago results because it had a weak 1986first quarter.                               4th Qtr     4th Qtr        %    7 Firms                      1986        1985       Chg    American Express           277,200     272,600    +   2    First Boston Corp           61,603      35,604    +  73    Hutton E F Group          -133,837     -12,156      ...

(now primarily an oil company)firmed prices and sparked panic buying. Bethlehem posted onlyits third quarterly profit in five years. LTV's loss,moreover, was illusory; it included $600 million in chargesrelated to its bankruptcy-law filing. On an operating basis,the No. 2 steelmaker earned $164 million as it captured USXcustomers and used its Chapter 11 status to avert hefty debtand pension payments. Several producers also benefited fromunusual items. Bethlehem had a $5 million gain fromdiscontinued businesses and a $26 million credit frominventory liquidations; year-ago results included a $50million loss from discontinued businesses and big gains frompension changes and inventory liquidation. Inland's earningsreflected $7 million in nonrecurring gains and $49 million ofinventory credits, against year-earlier restructuring chargesof $53.1 million. USX's steel unit posted a $1.37 billionoperating loss, but that mainly reflected $1.03 billion inpre-tax restructuring charges and the strike. Though thefirst quarter is seasonally strong, the respite won't lastlong. Economists expect prices to skid because of lowerconsumption by the auto and construction industries,diminished capital spending due to the new tax law, and USX'sreturn to steelmaking this month after its labor settlement.                               4th Qtr     4th Qtr        %    9 Firms                      1986        1985       Chg    Armco Inc                   34,600      18,600    +  86    Bethlehem Steel             34,200     -77,500      ...

Many concerns alsocontinued to benefit from cost-cutting in manufacturingoperations and profits from investments.

However, some analysts expectthe pace of earnings gains to slow. The first quarter &quot;willbe fairly flat for most companies because of the higher taxrate they'll be accruing this year,&quot; says Allan G. Bortel ofShearson Lehman Brothers. Effective tax rates will increasethis year and drop in 1988, he adds. Net income of FinancialCorp. of America, the parent of the nation's largest thrift,fell in the latest quarter largely because its loan-lossprovision increased 54% to $302.2 million.
