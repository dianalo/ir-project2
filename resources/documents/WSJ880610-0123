President Reagan is expected to sign the measure, which was passed yesterday by voice vote. The bill, a compromise between competing House and Senate versions, was approved by the House by a voice vote last month.    The new legislation, sponsored by Sen. James Exon (D., Neb.), would give the Federal Railroad Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, the authority to fine workers and managers and, under some circumstances, bar them from jobs that affect safety.    Under current law, the agency may fine companies for violating safety rules, but can't act against individual employees.    The bill also would require the Transportation Department to establish standards for locomotive operators, including a licensing requirement if it is deemed necessary.    The measure would increase to $10,000 the maximum civil penalty for each safety violation, and provide for an additional fine of as much as $20,000 for a &quot;grossly negligent violation.&quot; Currently, fines range from $250 to $2,500.    The bill also would specifically prohibit tampering with rail-safety devices. </TEXT></DOC>
