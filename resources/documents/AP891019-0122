In a rare, hour-long speech broadcast nationwide Wednesday,Mengistu accused the rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front ofrejecting peace overtures and of being ``bent on creating animmense act of fratricidal war.''   He said the insurgents also had joined in a ``sinisterconspiracy'' to facilitate the secession of Ethiopia's northernmostprovince, Eritrea, which has been the aim of another rebel group.   Mengistu said it was for the people to decide whether to allowEritrea to secede through the ``machinations'' of the TPLF, or to``defuse the vile conspiracy by mobilizing all the availableresources and score a decisive victory.''   ``We await the decision of the people,'' Mengistu said.   Since August, the TPLF is reported to have scored a string ofvictories, pushing government troops out of the rebels' Tigreprovince south into the heart of neighboring Wollo province and towithin 155 miles of the capital, Addis Ababa.   Diplomats say the offensive presents a strong challenge toMengistu's Marxist government, weakened by a bloody attempted coupin May, waning Soviet support and one of the world's pooresteconomies.   The rebels' southern progress appeared to have included thetaking of Dese, Wollo's regional capital, over the weekend, withgovernment troops and bureaucrats fleeing without a shot beingfired.   But Western diplomats said the rebels did not occupy the keycity and that, backed by hundreds of reinforcements, governmenttroops and personnel started returning to Dese on Tuesday andWednesday.   Foreign aid agencies have pulled a dozen or so expatriate reliefworkers from Dese back to Addis Ababa, apparently indefinitely, asthey monitor the military situation, said the diplomats, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   The diplomats said there appeared to be a lull in the fightingwith the rebels hiding in the hills around Dese and the governmentusing the time to bring in reinforcements from the Eritrean capitalof Asmara.   One of Mengistu's problems in slowing the rebels' advance hasbeen his demoralized army, observers said. After decades offighting, the force is principally made up of poorly paid youngconscripts with little training.   ``I think above all what Mengistu needs in Dese is quality _some trained troops who have proven their ability and theirloyalty,'' said one of the diplomats, who described the forces fromAsmara as just that.   They were instrumental in putting down a May coup attempt thatsaw more than a dozen generals slain and more than 100 other seniorofficers jailed.   Mengistu characterized the rebels as ``treacherous bandits'' whowere ``biting our hand stretched out in peace.''   In June, Mengistu offered to engage in unconditional peacenegotatiations in the presence of an international observer withthe rebel groups, and the first round of peace talks between thegovernment and the Eritreans took place last month in Atlanta. Asecond round of talks is scheduled to begin Nov. 18 in Nairobi.   The TPLF in July and August broadcast statements indicating itwas willing to engage in negotiations and Tuesday said it hadagreed on the ``basic idea'' of holding peace talks after amonthlong series of meetings in London with governmentrepresentatives.   Diplomats, however, who spoke by telephone from Ethiopia'scapital, were wary of the rebels' statement.   ``I think the TPLF is engaged in a strategy to build wedges andcracks in this government,'' said one. ``Any talks should be seenin this light.''   The TPLF took up arms in 1974 seeking greater autonomy for theprovince of Tigre and Mengistu's ouster. The secessionist Eritreanrebels have been fighting since 1962 in Africa's oldest civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
