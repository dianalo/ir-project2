software tools.andM;Some of these programs are so much alike that they're comparable toautomakers' &quot;corporate twins&quot;--identical cars built on the same assembly linebut sold under different brand names.andP;  Users who work with an application onone platform can immediately work with its twin on another platform.andM;More often, though, there are notable differences, despite the overallresemblance of the programs.andP;  The Mac and Windows environments offerdifferent services to their applications, leading to correspondingdifferences in their behavior.andP;  Windows offers superior keyboard shortcuts;the Macintosh has the advantage in the integration of desk-accesory programson machines with limited memory.andP;  The Mac also offers a more flexiblekeyboard, with convenient access to an extended character set and anon-screen key-mapping utility, while Windows' architecture lets applicationsprovide a more organized screen.andM;There's also the leapfrog phenomenon.andP;  In most cases, the Windows 3.0versions of programs are the latest renditions, and ths make use of what'sbeen learned since the last Macintosh version was produced.andP;  This willchange, as most developers move to parallel updating of products for bothplatforms, but for the next several months, Windows-version programs arelikely to be the more advanced.andM;In word processing, the premium twins are Microsoft's Word for Windows andWord for Macintosh.andP;  The similarity is high, but there are differences in theareas of macro capabilities (Windows has the edge) and printing (moreconvenient on the Macintosh).andP;  Depending on users' needs, cross-training maybe required.andM;Microsoft's spreadsheet twins are much closer to being identical.andP;  Excel forWindows, the Macintosh and Presentation Manager are very similar.andP;  Anyonefamiliar with one will feel right at home with the other.andM;This is also true of the Wingz spreadsheet from Informix Software Inc. ofMenlo Park, Calif., which also runs on NeXT workstations and is moregraphically advanced than Excel.andM;In databases, Omnis from Blyth Software Inc. of Foster City, Calif., anddbFast from Bumblebee Software Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., are two of the fewgraphically oriented cross-platform products.andM;The strongest cross-platform database, however, is probably Fox Software'sFoxBASE, whose Macintosh version provides graphic enhancements whileremaining compatible with dialects of Ashton-Tate's dBASE language.andP;  Oddlyenough, Ashton-Tate's dBASE Mac was never remotely similar to version ofdBASE for DOS, and all rights to dBASE Mac were recently sold to anothercompany.andM;Text-mode FoxBASE applications run in DOS sessions under Windows or in aterminal-like window on the Macintosh, using few of either systems' interfaceservices, but apparently meeting many users' needs.andM;In communications, Software Ventures Corp. of Berkeley, Calif., gets the nodfor the first major twin, Microphone II.andP;  Both interactive operations andprogrammed scripts are virtually identical on either platform.andM;Among page-layout and graphic-design programs, the senior siblings are thetwin version of PageMaker, from Aldus Corp. of Seattle, but there will alsosoon be a twin of Ventura Publisher from Ventura Software Inc. of San Diego.andO;Artist can turn to twin illustrator products from Adobe Systems Inc., ofMountain View, Calif., or Cricket Graph from Computer AssociatesInternational Inc., in San Jose, Calif.andP;  For clip art, there's the ClickArtseries from T/Maker Co., also in Mountain View.andM;Presentation makers can choose twin versions of Microsoft's Powerpoint; inmulti-media/education, there's Authorware from Authorware Inc. of Minneapolisand Guide from Owl International of Bellevue, Wash.andM;Where differences exist in menus and commands, but not in features, powerusers can increase the similarity of twin products with macros tailored totheir particular work group's needs.andP;  And yes, there's even a twin macroprogram: Tempo, from Affinity Microsystems Ltd. of Boulder, Colo.andM;Products like those described here keep options open for the future, withoutforcing users to settle on common-denominator solutions that may not do whatthey need today.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
