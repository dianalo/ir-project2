Robert McGarry, president of the 20,000-member union, said he considers a strike inevitable because of management's tough stand. It took union negotiators only about half an hour Saturday to reject the offer from Canada Post, a government agency that operates Canada's postal system. &quot;It was the same baloney only in different slices,&quot; a union official said of the offer.    A Canada Post spokesman said yesterday that the two sides were &quot;a long way apart.&quot; The strike deadline is 12:01 a.m. EDT tomorrow. At that time the letter carriers will be legally entitled to start a work stoppage in support of their contract demands.    Canada Post is pressing for concessions from the union on job security and work practices as part of its effort to get out of the red by next year. The company had a deficit of 184 million Canadian dollars ($137 million) in the year ended March 31, 1986, the latest year for which results have been reported.    In Canadian newspaper advertisements, Canada Post pledged that it will keep &quot;your mail moving&quot; if a strike occurs. In most previous postal strikes, mail distribution has halted.    Canada last had a postal strike in 1981, which lasted 42 days. That strike was called by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents mail sorters and other indoor workers.    Jean-Claude Parrot, president of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, pledged his union's full support for the letter carriers and he predicted that the mail won't move if a strike is called. The letter carriers and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers are expected to announce today their plans to collaborate during a strike.    The letter carriers are expected to hold &quot;rotating&quot; strikes, stopping deliveries in selected cities on various days. Such a tactic would allow most of the union members to continue drawing wages while the protest action proceeds. In past disputes, rotating strikes have crippled mail service.    A federally appointed conciliator, Kenneth Swan, warned that a work stoppage could lead to &quot;serious violence&quot; if Canada Post tries to continue operating with managers and temporary workers. Mr. Parrot said that if the strike is called &quot;I wouldn't like to be a guy delivering mail anywhere in this country.&quot;    Mr. Parrot's Canadian Union of Postal Workers expects to be legally entitled to strike by mid-August. Collective agreements of the major postal unions expired Dec. 31.    If the letter carriers strike tomorrow, it could be an important test for the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Many of Mr. Mulroney's supporters have been urging the government to deal resolutely with the postal unions, which have won generous concessions for their members in past contract negotiations.    In past contracts the letter carriers won strict limits on the length of their routes and the volume of mail they are required to carry. Critics claim they can complete their daily shifts several hours early and return to their homes and still get paid for full shifts.    Donald Lander, Canada Post president, told a recent meeting of major mail users that &quot;Canadians have been held to ransom through postal strikes in the past.&quot; He said Canada Post is &quot;determined to do something about bringing the cost base of our postal operations into line with those of other businesses.&quot;    In anticipation of a strike, the federal government mailed social security checks earlier than usual. Many companies have notified customers of alternative arrangements, including courier services, for delivery of bills. </TEXT></DOC>
