Certain limited exceptions are specified.The Office of Export Licensing must be notified in writing when the U.S.commodities being reexported are above the PRC green zone level. The rulespecifies what information would have to be included in the notice. Whileno specific form has been developed for this purpose at this time, BXAintends to do so in the future to facilitate OCR computerization of theinformation.The permissive reexport provision would also allow shipments into Switzerland,with the additional requirement that a Swiss Blue Import Certificate beobtained by the reexporting party.This procedure would not in any way alter the licensing requirements forsuch items to the Soviet Union and other COCOM-proscribed countries. Furthermore,this procedure would not authorize reexport to entities that the reexporterknows or has reason to know are controlled in fact by countries in CountryGroups Q, W, Y, or Z. BXA is seeking a means of assisting reexporters inidentifying such entities. Among the options that will be considered isa full or partial list of entities known to BXA. Comments on this aspectof the proposal are encouraged.Section 5(a)(6) of the EAA, as amended by the OTCA, requires issuance ofa regulation to define ``supercomputer'' for purposes of implementing sections5(a) (4) and (5) of the Act. This definition will be provided in a separateissuance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by January 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments (six copies) should be sent to: PatriciaMuldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O.

Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 2. This rule, includes a collection of information requirement under thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection, which would be included in andSection;774.2,is pending OMB approval. Public reporting burden for the reexport reportingrequirement is estimated to average approximately 25 minutes per response.This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burdenestimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, includingsuggestions for reducing this burden to the Office of Administration, Bureauof Export Administration, Room 3889, Department of Commerce, Washington,DC 20230 and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Because this rule is being issuedin proposed form, this rule complies with section 13(b) of the Export AdministrationAct. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemakingand an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations,this rule is issued in proposed form and comments will be considered inthe development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views. The period for submission of comments will close January 5, 1989. The Departmentwill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of thecomment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. The Department will not accept public comments accompaniedby a request that part or all of the material be treated confidentiallybecause of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. TheDepartment will return such comments and materials to the person submittingthe comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations.All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public recordand will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interestof accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will alsobe a matter of public record and will be available for public review andcopying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government orforeign governments will not be made available for public inspection. The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4086, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington DC 20230. Records in this facility, including writtenpublic comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published inPart 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
