Under the law, originallydesigned to combat organized crime, the government can seize assetsof defendants before trial, creating intense pressure on them tostrike a plea bargain. Below, and in an accompanying story, twoprominent voices argue the pros and cons of the Milken case.Michael Goldsmith is a legal scholar who consults extensively onRICO matters; Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman of IngersollPublications Co., is a personal friend of Milken's.</TEXT><BYLINE>By RALPH INGERSOLL II</BYLINE><BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   The Red Queen from ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' mightfeel right at home in today's U.S. Justice Department. ``Sentencefirst, verdict afterward,'' was her theory of jurisprudence, anapproach being adopted by overzealous Federal prosecutors withregard to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO)law.   The RICO law, enacted in 1970, contains two provisions to helpprosecutors fight the kind of organized crime I used to cover as ayoung reporter at the Elizabeth (N.J.) Daily Journal. Congressintended the RICO law to prosecute drug dealers and mob overlordswhose entire business is a crime. It was not drafted to be usedagainst legitimate businesses and individuals, who face irreparabledamage to their reputation and assets _ and the stigma of beingcompared with Al Capone as a ``racketeer'' _ even before they areaccused, much less convicted, of any wrongdoing.   RICO works like this:   Firstly, after an indictment it enables the government to seizea defendant's assets so that the ill-gotten gains cannot be spent,laundered or siphoned into foreign bank accounts in the periodbetween indictment and a trial. Secondly, after a conviction, RICOallows the seizure not only of the assets gained in the specificcrime, but all those associated with the now-proven racketeeringenterprise.   To a legitimate business enterprise or individual, who ispresumed innocent and ultimately may be shown to have committed nocrime at all, the prospect of RICO prosecution is staggering.Prosecutors know this, of course, and have used RICO as a bludgeonto coerce guilty pleas from the unindicted and exact tremendouspenalties on the unconvicted.   Drexel Burnham Lambert may well have been able to win on themerits of the government's case against the firm, a case the U.S.Attorney has been notably loathe to bring to court. But because aRICO charge would shut off Drexel's overnight bank credit and putit out of business in a single day, Drexel faced ruination fromeven a RICO charge. So Drexel agreed to plead guilty to sixfelonies rather than risk RICO indictment, certain bankruptcy andputting its 10,000 employees out of work. In other words, theguilty plea was extorted.   The latest victim of RICO abuse is Michael Milken, a visionaryinvestment banker who inspired a wave of entrepreneurial activityin the U.S. in the past decade and helped create jobs for hundredsof thousands of Americans. Notwithstanding the intent of Congress,he is being treated like a drug dealer mobster, and the U.S.Attorney is trying to seize his entire salary for the years 1983,1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.   Even though Milken resolutely denies any wrongdoing _ and,unlike Drexel, is going to fight the charges in court _ and eventhough the alleged actions with which he is charged accounted foronly a small fraction of his earnings during this period _ thegovernment wants to take every penny he has earned during this timeand jail him for ``hundreds of years.'' In the meantime, thegovernment has used RICO to force Milken out of his job, freeze hispersonal assets and effectively put him out of business. And stillno trial, much less a conviction.   RICO, then, seems to have turned the American judicialpresumption of innocence on its head. The Milken case has developedinto a civil rights issue, in which RICO is used to coercesettlements the government evidently feels it cannot win in courton the evidence confessed felon Ivan Boesky traded for a lenientsentence. Milken is being presumed guilty and severely punishedwithout trial under a law written to prevent drug dealers fromhiding their loot.</TEXT><TEXT>   Ralph Ingersoll II is chairman of Ingersoll Publications Co. ofPrinceton, N.J., which owns 40 daily U.S. newspapers and 150weeklies.
