Sayed El-Sayed of Texas Aandamp;M University said Tuesday his findingscould mean the existence of a threat to the krill, a tinyshrimp-like creature on which all Antarctic life depends directlyor indirectly.   If the krill goes, ``the whole ecosystem probably wouldcollapse,'' and the whales, seals, penguins, birds and fish woulddisappear, he told reporters at a briefing arranged by the WorldResources Institute, a Washington environmental policy researchinstitute that has called attention to ozone problems.   The ozone layer high above the earth thins by about half overAntarctica each spring, letting more ultraviolet light reach theground. If this happened over the globe as a whole, theEnvironmental Protection Agency says, each 1 percent decline inozone would mean a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet radiation anda 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skincancer.   The krill, which are an inch or two long, feed on phytoplankton,which are invisible to the naked eye. Fish and marine mammals inturn feed on the krill.   A 10 percent harvest of the 550 million to 770 million tons ofprotein represented by the krill could equal the entire fish catchof the world, and several nations are studying use of such aprotein resource.   El-Sayed and his students at an island near Palmer Stationlabeled test tanks of southern ocean water containingphytoplankton, the ``grass of the sea,'' with radioactive calciumcarbonate.   The radioactivity of the plankton after taking up the carbonisotope is a measure of photosynthesis, the process by which plantslive, deriving energy from sunlight.   Samples to which extra ultraviolet had been added showed farless radioactivity: 1,000 counts per minute on a scintillationcounter as opposed to 15,000 counts per minute for the sample fromwhich all ultraviolet had been excluded.   The extra ultraviolet was about 6.5 percent of what was alreadyin the light. On the day the measurements were made, ozone overheadwas only about 80 percent of normal, so the light was alreadypresumably enriched in ultraviolet.   Ultraviolet reaching the ground in Antarctica is not as much asit would be elsewhere under the same ozone layer. The sun is low inthe sky and its light travels a long slant distance through theozone.   Scientists attribute the Antarctic ozone hole, and a newlydiscerned average 2.3 percent year-round ozone decline in northernmid-latitudes since 1969, to man-made chemicals calledchlorofluorocarbons. Major producing nations agreed in Montreallast year to a 50 percent cut in production by 1998, and last weekdu Pont Co. said it planned to stop manufacture.   Lee M. Thomas, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, told reporters Tuesday that in light of the mid-latitudedecline, he would seek to accelerate the scientific review calledfor by the treaty so that participating nations could considerfurther production cuts when 1990 opens.   But Thomas said he would not support bills in the Senate,subject of a hearing today, calling for an early 95 percent cut inU.S. production.   Sayed, a biological oceanographer with 25 years of experience inthe Antarctic, was supported in his work last fall on Anvers Islandnear Palmer Station by the National Science Foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
