(introduction to hard diskdrives)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Levy, Charles.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The selection of a hard disk drive requires an understanding ofsuch factors as available physical size, disk capacity, accessperformance, computer interface, and mean time between failure(MTBF).andP;  The physical form factor has somewhat settled onhalf-height 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch units, though smaller, lowerpower drives are being incorporated into portable computers.andO;Individual users rarely need more than 200Mbytes of hard diskstorage, but networked fileserver applications are driving thegrowth of drive arrays or clusters.andP;  Improved access performancein the 16ms-25ms range is being provided by voice-coil technology.andO;ESDI and SCSI interfaces are offering faster disk accessperformance and more compact size, with SCSI units able to chainup to eight drives.andP;  MTBF is now generally in the20,000-to-50,000-hour range, with some drive vendors using powersleep functions to reduce ware.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Hard DiskDisk DrivesTechnologyProductsHardware SelectionSizePerformanceInterface.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
