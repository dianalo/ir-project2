(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cold weather slowed the rise of the RedRiver on Sunday, giving a reprieve to weary homeowners who havefought flooding with pumps, dikes and heaps of sandbags.   The river, which forms the boundary between Minnesota and NorthDakota, was expected to crest Sunday evening a foot lower than hadbeen anticipated.   ``The river seems to be slowing down, and that's good news,''Col. Roger Baldwin of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said duringa tour of the flood-ravaged area with Gov. Rudy Perpich. Thegovernor later said he would ask for federal disaster relief.   The bloated river flooded Breckenridge and Wahpeton, N.D.,across the river last week, damaging as many as 900 homes andforcing the evacuation of scores of people.   Lou Bennett, chief meterologist for the National WeatherService, said cold weather Saturday night in Moorhead and Fargo,N.D., helped slow the runoff from the winter's plentiful snowfall.   Temperatures fell into the teens Saturday night and stayed wellbelow freezing Sunday. Daytime highs usually are in the 40s duringthis time of the year.   The weather service changed its crest prediction to 35{ feet forthe two communities. Forecasters had been expecting a 36{-footcrest on Monday.   Bennett said cold weather should cause the water to drain awaymore slowly. The river was expected to remain above its 17-footflood stage at Fargo for at least 10 days, he said.   Residents of Fargo and Moorhead had ample time to prepare forthe flood. Hundreds of homeowners built sandbag dikes around theirproperty to keep out encroaching water.</TEXT></DOC>
