Observers said that while the agreement legitimizes part of whatthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is alreadyproducing, it still undershoots the cartel's actual production,believed to be above 22.5 million barrels a day.   The new accord raises the official ceiling to 20.5 millionbarrels a day in the fourth quarter from 19.5 million in the thirdperiod.   ``They're getting closer to institutionalizing what they'realready doing,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of theenergy group at Elders Futures Inc. ``So it didn't solve anyquestions.''   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, closed 6cents higher at $19.59 a barrel after trading as much as 30 centsunder Tuesday's close of $19.53.   Among refined products, heating oil for October delivery rose0.75 cent to finish at 58.46 cents a gallon and November added 0.84cent to 58.90 cents.   Unleaded gasoline for delivery in October dipped 1.64 cents to58.74 cents a gallon.   It was the third straight decline in as many days after a sharpincrease last week on news that a big refinery in the VirginIslands had sustained severe hurricane damage and would be closedfor 60 days. The refinery, owned by Amerada Hess Corp., suppliesmarkets in the eastern United States.   ``The market is saying that it overreacted to the Hess refinerydamage,'' said Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc.   Baker, as well as other market analysts, predicted that crudeprices in coming weeks would ``fluctuate along with the temperaturein OPEC'' in advance of the regularly scheduled meeting in Novemberof the oil group. But no sharp fluctuations are anticipated, theysaid.   Observers have already predicted that OPEC would make yetanother change in its production ceiling at the next meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
