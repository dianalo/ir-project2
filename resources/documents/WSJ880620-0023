It already may be too late to stop the quiet, but deadly epidemic.    With a few noteworthy exceptions, the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which now has 130 signatories, has significantly slowed the spread of atomic weapons. But until a year ago, there was nothing to prevent any nation with enough money from buying or developing the most effective means of delivering a severe, long-range punch -- the modern ballistic missile.    It is belatedly dawning on American and West European officials (and journalists) that these large, supersonic missiles can be a menace even without nuclear warheads. They can carry powerful new conventional explosives or, worse yet, easy-to-make chemical weapons like those being used by both sides in the Iran-Iraq war.    With their V-2 rockets, the Nazis pioneered the use of ballistic missiles as terror weapons against cities in 1945. Iraq and Iran continue to follow in Hitler's jackboot steps: Since Feb. 29, they have lobbed, by one estimate, 500 missiles at each other's capitals, killing 2,000 people -- almost all of them civilians.    The long-running &quot;war of the cities&quot; between Iran and Iraq has so unnerved Saudi Arabia, their mutual rival in the Persian Gulf, that the Saudis secretly purchased several dozen CSS-2 long-range missiles from China. Assurances from Beijing that no nuclear warheads were part of the deal, and a Saudi promise to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, have been cold comfort to Washington.    The missiles have both military and political appeal. Militarily, as Aaron Karp of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute notes in a comprehensive article in the current &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,&quot; conventional air raids are becoming riskier. The Soviets, Mr. Karp notes, had trouble using their air power against Afghan rebels equipped with relatively cheap, U.S.-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. And modern radars, missiles, and early-warning systems &quot;make aerial penetration ever more difficult and dangerous.&quot; Ballistic missiles, in contrast, are hard to shoot down, and when they are, they can't be taken prisoner.    The real appeal of ballistic missiles, however, is political. First, like jet fighters before them, they have become status symbols. Second, just like the superpowers, Third World countries now argue that they can't maintain a credible deterrent without ballistic missiles. Third, the iron logic of all arms races doesn't stop with Moscow and Washington: Once one nation acquires a new weapon, its adversaries feel increasing pressure to keep up with the neighbors.    The result has been a dramatic proliferation of ballistic missiles and the technology to make them. Some 20 nations either have such missiles already or will before the end of the century, says a State Department official. Although the U.S. stopped peddling ballistic missiles in 1974, the Soviets have made their 175-mile-range Scud-B the Model T of missiles; Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, and Syria all have it.    Argentina, Brazil, India, and Pakistan all are developing their own missiles; India tested its Prithvi, which has a 150-mile range, last February. Israel has had missiles -- and, intelligence officials believe, nuclear warheads -- for years.    In an attempt to stanch the spread of missiles, the U.S., Canada, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and West Germany in April 1987 announced that they had agreed to ban the sale of missiles that can deliver a 1,100-pound payload 180 miles or more. The pact also limits the export of some technology needed to manufacture such missiles.    But the industrial nations' attempt to shut the barn door is both too late and too little. China and the Soviet Union, the two leading missile marketers, haven't shown much interest in joining, and such future suppliers as Brazil and Argentina have shown none at all. Moreover, according to U.S. arms-control officials, some Western rocket engineers have evaded the controls by setting up shop in countries that aren't party to the agreement. Finally, each country that signed is charged with enforcing its own adherence to the agreement and there is no way to verify how vigorously anyone is doing so. </TEXT></DOC>
