Executives at several major brokerage firms say they arereviewing their self-imposed bans on trading South Africansecurities in light of President Bush's executive orderlifting the sanctions, signed yesterday. The firms say,however, that there are legal and technical issues to beworked out before they can restart trading.</LP><TEXT>   The first step is likely to be a resumption of researchand trading of American depositary receipts of South Africanmining and other companies, perhaps within several weeks.ADRs are a way for investors to trade foreign stocks in theU.S.   The brokers considering a resumption of trading includeMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. and American Express Co.'s ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc., the two biggest U.S. brokerage houses.Both firms currently have strict rules against SouthAfrica-related business.   Merrill, for example, expanded its anti-apartheid policyin 1989, when it ceased all securities research on andtrading of South African ADRs and closed the accounts ofSouth African customers. The firm, like other U.S. brokers,had already stopped doing any business in or with SouthAfrica. Now, those sweeping policies are likely to be eased.   Yesterday, a Merrill spokeswoman said the firm's SouthAfrica policy remains in effect &quot;at this time.&quot; She added:&quot;However, we periodically review all of our policies todetermine if modifications are warranted based on changes inthe circumstances which led to the policies in the firstplace. South Africa policy will undergo such a review.&quot;   Similar reviews are being undertaken at Shearson; MorganStanley Group Inc.; Bear Stearns Cos.; Dean Witter ReynoldsInc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.; and other U.S.securities firms.   Privately, securities executives leave little doubt aboutthe outcome of the reviews, even though they insist thattrading South African ADRs isn't very lucrative. &quot;We'redefinitely going to do it, assuming there isn't some hugeoutcry,&quot; said a top executive at one brokerage firm, whoasked not to be identified. &quot;{But} the bottom line is, youjust want to do the right thing without {ticking} someoneoff.&quot;   Still, it could be some time before U.S. brokerage firmsresume the entire range of business related to South Africa,such as direct dealings with the government there. That'sbecause major U.S. cities and state governments -- and bigpublic employee pension funds -- have institutedanti-apartheid policies that prohibit business with SouthAfrica. If U.S. brokerage firms violate these policies, theyrun the risk of losing out on lucrative bond underwritingsand other business.   ADRs are traded on U.S. stock exchanges and in theover-the-counter market. They represent shares of a foreignstock, but the actual shares are physically kept in theforeign country, usually in the custody of a bank.   Wall Street may face opposition if it resumes tradingSouth Africa ADRs, even though such an action is only a smallstep toward resuming South Africa-related dealings. Somevocal opponents of Pretoria's white-minority government sayU.S. brokerage firms shouldn't resume business as usual untilSouth African completes the dismantling of apartheid, or thecountry's policy of racial segregation.   &quot;If these companies think we're going to go away becauseof what Bush has done, they have something else coming,&quot; saidRichard Knight of the Africa Fund, a New York anti-apartheidgroup. U.S. brokerage firms, if they resume South Africandealings, are &quot;going to come rapidly into conflict with theanti-apartheid movement and city and state legislation,&quot; hesaid.   Not every brokerage firm is expected to resume ADR tradingright away. CS First Boston Inc. -- which has receivedcriticism for its connection to South Africa through theSwiss bank that controls it, Credit Suisse -- said its policyof not doing South Africa-related business is a matter thatmust be decided by its board of directors. The matter is &quot;noton the agenda at this point,&quot; a spokeswoman said yesterday.   A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the firm is &quot;gratifiedthat the president has determined that the goals of theanti-apartheid act have been met, and we will be reexaminingour position regarding trade involving South Africa in lightof recent positive developments.&quot;   One of the anti-apartheid movement's biggest successes onWall Street occurred just two months ago, when J.P. Morgan andamp;Co., the big U.S. banking company that pioneered ADRs in1927, announced that it would stop issuing ADRs for SouthAfrican companies. The bank already had stopped making newloans, or voluntarily renewing existing ones, to public orprivate borrowers in South Africa. Yesterday, a bankspokesman said: &quot;The progress made in South Africa towardending apartheid that has led the president to lift thesanctions is also causing us at J.P. Morgan to review ourpolicies. We will continue to watch the situation.&quot;   Despite Mr. Bush's lifting of sanctions, brokerageexecutives conceded that the waters remain muddied regardingSouth Africa. They noted that the U.S. government's positionon South Africa has never been the key point for them.Because of the underwriting business provided by U.S. stateand city governments, &quot;clearly the bigger issue for us is thestate and local municipalities and what {Mr. Bush's} actionwill prompt them to do,&quot; one Wall Street executive said.</TEXT></DOC>
