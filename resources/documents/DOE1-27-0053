According to the presentagreement with the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) the activeand reactive power swing at the 400kV point of supply should not exceed575MW and 375MVAr. The voltage drop should be less than 1.5% and therise and decay of JET load should not exceed 200MW/s. There are alsolimitations in load power steps the purpose being to protect componentsof the CEGB power system. The paper presents two simulated JET scenariosin which the plasma current is Ip = 5MA and the additional heating powerto the plasma is 25MW. The pulse termination is either normal or abnormal(plasma disruption). In the first case a reactive power compensationof 130MVAr is needed in order to comply with the limits on voltage drop.In case of plasma disruption an active power compensation of 150MW isneeded in addition in order that the combined JET load may remain withinthe present limits of active power step, reactive power swing and voltagedrop.</TEXT></DOC>
