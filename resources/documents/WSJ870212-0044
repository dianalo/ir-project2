In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of a wide variety of camping and sports equipment and heating and air conditioning products had net income of $136,000, or two cents a share.    Sales in the quarter, usually the company's weakest, increased about 21% to &quot;a little over&quot; $113 million from $93.9 million a year earlier, partly as result of two recent acquisitions, the executives said.    Coleman said a favorable tax situation in the year-earlier period made the two quarters' operating results about comparable. The company expects to report an operating loss before taxes of about $400,000 for the period, compared with a $360,000 loss a year earlier.    &quot;There's a little disappointment&quot; as a result of the quarter's results, said Frank Shaw, an executive vice president and one of three executives who share the post of chief executive officer. &quot;But there's certainly not any disappointment for the year and certainly not any disappointing indicators for the future.&quot; The company expects to have record sales in 1987 and a &quot;substantial gain&quot; in per-share earnings, Mr. Shaw said.    For the year, executives said, Coleman expects to report net income increased 71% to about $17.1 million, or $2.45 a share, from $10 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier.    Coleman said a change in pension accounting increased fourth-quarter profit by about $279,000, or four cents a share, and the year's profit by about $1.1 million, or 16 cents a share. The quarterly results were also boosted by about $1.4 million, or 20 cents a share, from recalculating the profit impact of certain tax benefits to account for changes in the tax code. </TEXT></DOC>
