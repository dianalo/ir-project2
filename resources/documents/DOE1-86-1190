Newtrends of radiation mutagenesis of subtropic plants are formulated asresults of studies during many years. A lot of mutants is subjected tosufficient tests, and concrete results are obtained with the help ofthese tests for definite species. Summing genetic and selection estimationsof the results, it is possible to make the conclusion that mutant selectionrepresents one of the powerful methods of preparation of productive andqualitative species of subtropic plants, which are successfully introducedinto practice. 38 refs.; 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
