This city's cabbies, for one.    &quot;They've been going from one speech to another all week,&quot; says taxi driver Scotty Dell, shaking his head. &quot;You gotta feel sorry for guys who think attending a meeting on tort reform is a great way to spend a Sunday in San Francisco.&quot;    Some 13,500 lawyers are here this week for the American Bar Association's annual convention, and efforts by spouses and strip-tease barkers to entice them away from speeches and seminars appear to be failing. A Saturday morning talk entitled &quot;Showdown at the 1040 Corral: Confrontations between the IRS and Tax Practitioners&quot; was packed.    But it isn't all Dullsville. Here are some snapshots from the convention:    ---   A seminar on the Baby M case sparked heated debate.    &quot;You cannot outlaw surrogate parenting. It is here to stay,&quot; says Gary N. Skoloff, a Livingston, N.J., lawyer who represents William and Elizabeth Stern, who had hired Mary Beth Whitehead to be a surrogate mother. &quot;There are too many people out there who want a family. Adoption is not a viable option. There are no kids out there to adopt.&quot;    Mr. Skoloff blames the legal profession and state lawmakers for &quot;failing to keep up with advances in medical sciences.&quot; To forestall future battles like the one over Baby M, he says, states should regulate surrogate parenting by licensing private agencies to handle such transactions.    But Harold J. Cassidy, who represents Ms. Whitehead, says surrogate parenting has created &quot;a new class of children&quot; who are bought and sold like property. He would advise women who are considering becoming surrogate mothers to seek out mothers who had to give up children to adoption, he says; &quot;ask them if they sleep at night, even 20 years later.&quot;    Legal specialists expect that the Baby M case is just the first of a spate of litigation to come as a result of medical advances. Among other cases, they also expect battles over the rights and responsibilities of sperm and ovum donors.    ---   AIDS, meanwhile, is expected to spark an epidemic of litigation.    Already, more than 150 lawsuits have been filed against blood banks and blood-plasma manufacturers by people who contracted the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, says Duncan Barr, a San Francisco lawyer who represents blood banks. Mr. Barr says he expects the number of lawsuits to soar as high as 4,000 in the next few years. &quot;It's doubtful many blood banks will survive the coming litigation,&quot; he warns.    AIDS victims and their families are turning to the courts more and more often for help in fighting discrimination by employers, schools, landlords, government and insurers. &quot;The discrimination is absolutely overwhelming,&quot; says Harvey Grossman, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union in Chicago. &quot;People are losing their insurance, their jobs, their will to live. There have been suicides.&quot;    &quot;Employers who try to avoid their benefits obligations (to workers who contract AIDS) could be hit with substantial tort damages,&quot; says Scott Silverman, a lawyer who advises corporate clients about the disease.    ---   A poll of the nation's judges turns up a discomforting revelation.    When the weekly National Law Journal asked judges what is the most frustrating aspect of their job, 4% said &quot;making decisions.&quot;    ---   Business can take comfort from legal developments in trendsetting California.    The boom in wrongful-termination lawsuits by workers against employers may be nearing an end, says Edward Lascher, a lawyer in Ventura, Calif. Companies are increasingly successful in getting trial-court verdicts against them overturned on appeal, he says. He predicts that a newly conservative California Supreme Court may limit remedies for workers who are fired or laid off.    Mr. Lascher predicts state lawmakers will move to curb lawyers' fees and set limits on damages in personal-injury lawsuits, making such cases less lucrative for lawyers. As a result, traditional deep-pocket defendants such as cities and hospitals may get some relief from the torrent of lawsuits they've had to fight.    But &quot;bank bashing is still hot,&quot; Mr. Lascher says, citing a big increase in the number of successful lawsuits by customers against financial institutions. &quot;Jurors themselves are bedeviled by banks,&quot; he says, &quot;and they're ready to swing.&quot; The banking industry, he says, &quot;failed to take this kind of litigation seriously&quot; until it was hit by multimillion-dollar awards.    ---   Lawyers are moving quickly to automate their practices.    The ABA Journal reports that 75% of the 750 law firms it recently surveyed own or lease computers. International Business Machines Corp. has 51% of the market; Wang Laboratories Inc. has 17% and Apple Computer Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. are tied at 7.4% of the market, the magazine reports.    ---   Private courts and rent-a-judge programs gain in popularity.    Frustrated litigants seek relief from crowded civil court dockets and costly delays by turning to private adjudication. Says Donald King, a state court of appeals judge in San Francisco, &quot;This is the trend of the future.&quot;    Private courts, mini-trials and rent-a-judge programs are especially popular with litigants in asbestos cases and construction disputes because they offer much speedier and less costly resolutions than state or federal courts, Judge King told a seminar on private justice.    To encourage private adjudication of disputes, more states are offering private-court litigants the use of public facilities for trials and settlement conferences. Some states even allow private-court sponsors to draw jurors for private mini-trials from the public jury pool.    But the trend toward private adjudication also is stirring some fears among some legal specialists who fear a strong private-court system will weaken the public-court system. &quot;Are we going to have a second system of justice in this country for those who are wealthy enough to opt out of the public courts?&quot; asks Robert Gnaizda, a lawyer from San Francisco. &quot;Our public-court system is on the verge of collapse. But is an alternate system of justice for the power elite the answer?&quot;    ---   The keynote speaker at a luncheon sponsored by the ABA's Section on Family Law: Zsa Zsa Gabor. </TEXT></DOC>
