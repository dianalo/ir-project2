Quoting sources it did not identify, the newspaper said bothsides were close to an agreement late Tuesday that would end one ofthe most intensive criminal securities fraud investigations inhistory.   A $750 million fine for securities fraud would dwarf the record$100 million in penalties paid two years ago by Ivan F. Boesky, thenow-imprisoned stock speculator who turned state's evidence and hasbeen a key source of evidence against Drexel.   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has maintainedinnocence throughout an investigation that has been colored by pressleaks and speculation.   Drexel executives have said they are interested in a settlementto avoid prosecution and a lengthy trial, but admitting guilt wouldmark a stunning turnaround and open the firm to numerous civillawsuits by investors who allege they were defrauded.   Steven Anreder, Drexel's chief spokesman, declined to comment onthe Journal story. Officials at the Securities and ExchangeCommission and Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, who have beencoordinating the Drexel investigation, also declined comment.   Drexel is privately owned and is one of the most profitable WallStreet firms, specializing in the market for high-yield, high-riskdebt securities commonly called ``junk bonds.''   It has played a major role in some of the biggest corporatetakeovers of all time, including the record $24.53 billionacquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.announced Nov. 30.   Drexel is known to have set aside hundreds of millions of dollarsfor a potential settlement with the government. The firm is eager toavoid a racketeering indictment, which could seriously impair itsbusiness and involve enormous fines if a jury found Drexel guilty.   Three months ago SEC filed a massive civil lawsuit that accusedDrexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and three otherkey employees of conspiring with Boesky to profit on insideinformation, manipulate stock, defraud Drexel clients, keep phonybooks and other violations.   A federal grand jury has been expected to indict Drexel oncriminal charges as well, but the indictments repeatedly have beendelayed, evidently as a pressure tactic to convince the potentialdefendants to reach plea-bargain settlements instead.   While Drexel has expressed interest in settling, Milken has notnegotiated with government prosecutors and has vowed to vindicatehimself at trial.</TEXT></DOC>
