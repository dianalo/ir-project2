The European Community Commission's formal policy is to lift by year's end the system of production quotas that has helped support EC steel prices. About 60% of the EC's steel production currently is subject to the quotas.    But Eurofer, the association of the EC's major steel producers, argues that the industry is still too weak to take the shock of liberalization. Eurofer said that quotas for the products covered by the capacity cuts should be maintained until the cuts are completed.    The planned cuts, which would take place over three years, are larger than those outlined to the EC commission by the steelmakers last autumn. The new plan was presented to the EC commission Monday, and EC industry ministers will discuss it on March 19. A final figure wasn't included for cuts of production capacity in hot-rolled coil.    Eurofer said &quot;detailed discussions&quot; will be held between the steel producers and &quot;if necessary&quot; with governments, in order to reach a &quot;satisfactory solution.&quot; Production of hot-rolled coil is politically sensitive because most of the capacity is in large, publicly owned companies. </TEXT></DOC>
