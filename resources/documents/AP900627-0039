An opposition leader predicted violence could result if theNational Affairs Conference fails to find a way to give more powerto native Taiwanese, who have been dominated by the rulingNationalist Party that retreated to this island from mainland Chinain 1949.   President Lee Teng-hui called for the conference in March afterwidespread public demonstrations demanding the scrapping of thesystem that has preserved the Nationalists' lock on power.   ``We would pay a very painful price should the conference failto set the direction of reforms in accordance with publicexpectations,'' said Chen Yung-hsing, acting chairman of thenation's largest opposition group, the Democratic Progressive Party.   He warned of violent demonstrations in case of a deadlock.   The one-week meeting will be attended by 150 delegates,including 80 members of the ruling party and 16 representativesfrom the Democratic Progressive Party. Independent academics andpoliticians account for the bulk of the remaining seats.   Although President Lee has not explicitly promised to followrecommendations made by the delegates, it would be difficult forhim to reject a proposal that had broad support from conferencemembers.   The debate will focus on what to do with the 1947 constitution,enacted in China by the Nationalist government two years before itlost a civil war to the Communists and retreated to the offshoreisland now home to 20 million people.   The Nationalists have since used the constitution as the legalbasis for their political power.   Claiming to still be the legitimate government of all China, theNationalists have not allowed native Taiwanese to vote for amajority of seats in the national Legislature and the electoralcollege. Instead, the party froze in lawmakers elected on theChinese mainland more than four decades ago.   The Nationalists have acknowledged the need for change as theaging lawmakers from the mainland die off and the increasinglyaffluent native Taiwanese, who account for 85 percent of theisland's 20 million people, demand more political power.   The Nationalists are expected to propose changing theconstitution so all members of parliament are elected in Taiwan.   But the ruling party delegates appear divided over whether theelectoral college should be replaced by presidential elections andwhether the strong presidency should give way to a Cabinet-ledgovernment.   The Democratic Progressive Party believes that just amending theconstitution does not go far enough and wants to replace it withwhat they call a ``Great Charter of Democracy.''   Opposition delegates say the charter would provide for directpresidential elections and allow the people of Taiwan to determinewhether they should drop reunification with mainland China as anational goal.   But Taiwan independence is vehemently rejected by both theNationalists and the Communist government in Beijing, which regardsthe island as a renegade province that must return to the fold.   Perhaps that is why opposition party members suggest the issueof reunification be put off indefinitely.   ``We respect the rights and wisdom of our next generation andwill leave some room for them to settle the matter,'' said HuangHuang-hsiung, a conference delegate who heads the oppositionparty's constitution task force.</TEXT></DOC>
