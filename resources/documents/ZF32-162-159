(electronic datainterchange) (X.400 electronic mail systems)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Scott, Karyl.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee(CCITT) has enacted a new specification, X.435, that links X.400electronic messaging with electronic data interchange (EDI).andP;  Thespecification details how EDI documents can be encapsulated asX.400 messages and transmitted via public X.400 services providedby long-distance carriers and by value added network (VAN)providers or directly between trading partners.andP;  Experts supportthe X.400 standard because it is more economical and efficientthan other methods for transferring EDI data.andP;  The X.435specification indicates that the new P-EDI protocol should be usedfor sending EDI documents using the X.400 standard.andP;  No commercialproducts have implemented X.435, but early users believe thelinking of X.400 and EDI is ideal.andP;  The store-and-forward qualityof X.400 is perfect for EDI applications because they normally donot require real-time transmission.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Electronic data interchangeInternational Telegraph and Telephone Consultative CommitteeCommunications TechnologyTelecommunicationsStandardsValue-Added NetworksElectronic mail systemsComputer industry.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
