At the same time, Sundstrand and some senior officials remain under federal grand jury investigation in Rockford, Ill., in a far more-serious case of alleged military overcharges. Defense Department audits being reviewed by prosecutors in that case conclude that the Rockford-based concern overcharged the Pentagon by more than $100 million going back several years, these sources said.    In a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sundstrand, which had $579 million in military sales in 1987, said, &quot;The government has advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal violations&quot; in both the Illinois and Seattle investigations.    The company report acknowledged that it &quot;is in the process of entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions,&quot; and that such settlements could make it ineligible to obtain new government contracts for an indefinite period. In addition, Sundstrand, which makes engine start-up systems, flight data recorders and other electronic equipment for commercial and military aircraft, said such settlements could result in &quot;the imposition of materially adverse fines and penalties.&quot;    Taken together, the two cases could result in the largest total payment ever to the U.S. Treasury for alleged military-contracting fraud, and provide an important boost to federal efforts to root out cost-accounting fraud by major Pentagon contractors.    In the Seattle case, the proposed plea agreement is said to cover allegations that the company's unit, Sundstrand Data Control, improperly included patent-litigation expenses in overhead costs on military contracts. It is alleged that the company failed to disclose improper accounting practices during later contract negotiations with the Defense Department.    The arrangement is said to call for the company to plead guilty to filing false statements with the government.    Justice Department officials hope the Seattle arrangement will prod Sundstrand into signing a plea agreement in the Illinois case. One federal investigator said Sundstrand's willingness to accept the Seattle arrangement before the issues in the Illinois case are resolved indicates that the company is eager to put its legal problems behind it.    The company declined to comment beyond its recent SEC filing.    Though discussions are continuing on the Seattle arrangement, hammered out by attorneys from Sundstrand and the Justice Department's fraud section, it is expected to be signed any day. It isn't expected to be announced, however, until the Illinois investigation is resolved.    William Hendricks and Theodore Greenberg, the senior Justice Department officials in the fraud section, declined to comment on either case. And in Chicago, Anton Valukas, the U.S. attorney, whose office is presenting evidence to the grand jury in Rockford, said he couldn't comment on a continuing investigation.    Nonetheless, people familiar with the Illinois overcharge investigation said Mr. Valukas is taking a hard-nosed approach toward Sundstrand. They said he is reviewing, among other matters, instances where Sundstrand allegedly charged off private commercial costs to Air Force and Navy contracts and subcontracts.    Documents released by the Defense Department show that in the past few years, Pentagon auditors repeatedly challenged Sundstrand's accounting procedures. An August 1985 audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, for example, asserted that the company during the previous three years overcharged the government nearly $3 million by billing twice for some parts.    In this case, auditors contended that Sundstrand charged off certain parts it claimed were excess inventory as indirect military contract costs, sold the parts at &quot;nominal prices&quot; to a company, allegedly for scrap, and then reacquired the same parts &quot;at substantially higher prices&quot; for use on government contracts. The auditors asserted that Sundstrand never lost control over the parts, and that the sales weren't &quot;bona fide&quot; transactions. They said Sundstrand billed the government a second time for many of the parts as a &quot;direct material cost.&quot;    Another 1985 Defense Department audit concluded that Sundstrand overcharged the government by nearly $10.8 million through &quot;inequitable allocation&quot; of certain inventory, loss and obsolescence charges, including some that should have been borne by commercial customers.    Last year, Pentagon auditors asserted that Sundstrand improperly billed the government $560,000 for certain costs associated with participation in air shows in Paris and Britain. And earlier they had pinpointed more than $35 million in allegedly improper accounting for warranty, data-processing, and foreign sales and service costs.    Overall, the company's 1987 annual report said the government alleged accounting irregularities amounting to $116.4 million between 1978 and 1985. Sundstrand, which set aside $61.5 million before taxes for the &quot;ultimate resolution&quot; of the government-contracts disputes, said in an SEC filing that it had &quot;implemented changes in its procedures to minimize future disagreements between the company and the government.&quot;    Military sales, often to other companies that hold direct contracts with the Pentagon, accounted for about 40% of Sundstrand's $1.37 billion in sales last year. </TEXT></DOC>
