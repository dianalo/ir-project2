In a complaint filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., the SEC said James Markham spent about $33,000 buying Toys &quot;R&quot; Us call options in November and December 1986 after learning of the company's robust performance during the crucial Christmas season. At the time Mr. Markham was director of industrial purchasing for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.    In January, after Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, based in Paramus, N.J., disclosed that 1986 Christmas sales rose 26.8% from the previous season's results, Mr. Markham sold the options and made a profit of almost $40,000, the SEC said.    Mr. Markham couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney, Anne Flannery, said, &quot;He intends to contest the charges.&quot; She declined to comment further.    Michael Goldstein, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us executive vice president, said Mr. Markham resigned after his options trading was discovered. He described Mr. Markham as &quot;a good, hard worker&quot; and declined to comment further.    The SEC charged in its complaint that Mr. Markham traded in the face of a company memorandum explicitly warning senior executives of the sensitivity of the closely held sales information and recommending that they trade in Toys &quot;R&quot; Us securities only after sales figures were released to the public.    The SEC asked the court to enjoin Mr. Markham from future violations of securities laws and order him to disgorge his profits and pay a penalty of as much as three times those profits. </TEXT></DOC>
