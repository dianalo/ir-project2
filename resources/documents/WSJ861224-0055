Unigesco, a holding company here, and Canam-Manac, a maker of steel products and office furniture based in St. Georges de Beauce, Quebec, said they formed a holding company and that it currently holds 10,355,000 Noverco shares, making it Noverco's largest shareholder.    Noverco was formed earlier this year as the parent for Gaz Metropolitain Inc., which distributes natural gas through most of Quebec.    Unigesco and Canam-Manac said they each began accumulating Noverco stock several months ago on the open market and that they decided to pool their holdings following talks that began earlier this month. The combination resulted in a stake of about 12% of Noverco.    Yesterday, Unigesco and Canam-Manac bought a block of 4.5 million Noverco shares from Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, the Quebec government's pension fund manager, for $14.75 a share (Canadian), raising the stake to 20%.    Trading in Noverco stock was halted on the Montreal Exchange yesterday pending the announcement. It last traded at $13.375 a share, down 25 cents from Monday's close.    Caisse de Depot retains a 15% stake in Noverco, as does Societe Quebecoise d'Initiatives Petrolieres, the Quebec government's oil and gas concern. Canam-Manac and Unigesco said they signed an agreement with the two major Noverco holders that includes reciprocal rights of first refusal on their Noverco holdings.    Canam-Manac and Unigesco said they haven't any intention of increasing their stake in Noverco &quot;in the foreseeable future.&quot;    Bertin Nadeau, Unigesco's president, said he expects harmonious relations between his company, Canam-Manac and Noverco's management. Mr. Nadeau and Marcel Dutil, Canam-Manac's president and chief executive officer, said they will join Noverco's board next month.    Unigesco and Canam-Manac are fast-growing concerns that have capitalized on a provincial stock savings plan. The program encourages Quebec residents to buy shares in Quebec-based concerns by providing generous tax breaks on provincial income tax. Unigesco and Canam-Manac said they will finance the purchase of Noverco stock internally.    Unigesco earlier this year acquired a 20% stake in Montreal-based Provigo Inc., Canada's second-largest food distributor.    Canam-Manac's Mr. Dutil said he was attracted to Noverco because its business as a natural-gas distributor will counter the cyclical nature of Canam-Manac's own business, which depends heavily on the construction industry.    Separately, Noverco said in an initial filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it holds a 6.3% stake in Sceptre Resources Ltd., an oil and gas concern based in Calgary, Alberta.    R.A. Gusella, Sceptre's president, said Noverco has been a shareholder for some time, but only recently acquired more than 5%, which requires notification of the SEC. The total cost of Noverco's holding in Sceptre is $4.6 million, the filing said.    Noverco said the acquisition is an investment and that it may buy as much as 9.9% of Sceptre. Mr. Gusella described Noverco as a &quot;welcome shareholder.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
