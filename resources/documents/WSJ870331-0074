Lawyers and prosecutors involved in recent insider litigation disagreed on whether the ruling, by U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram, could significantly affect other cases. However, some said the type of &quot;wall&quot; the judge erected, if applied in more complicated insider cases, could delay the U.S. Attorney's office in gathering market-related evidence that the SEC can get more easily.    Judge Kram's ruling came in a motion in an SEC case against Israel G. Grossman, a lawyer formerly with Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel in New York. Mr. Grossman, whose criminal case is being handled by another judge, was arrested earlier this month and simultaneously sued by the SEC in an alleged insider scheme. The government charges Mr. Grossman leaked nonpublic details of Colt Industries Inc.'s 1986 recapitalization plan, helping six relatives and friends make $1.5 million in illegal profits.    Only Mr. Grossman was indicted on the related criminal charges; the relatives and friends were sued along with Mr. Grossman by the SEC.    Mr. Grossman, who denies the charges, had sought to delay the SEC case until the criminal case was over. Among other reasons, he claimed the government brought the SEC case &quot;solely to obtain evidence&quot; for the criminal case.    Judge Kram didn't agree with that claim, and ruled, in an opinion issued yesterday, that &quot;public interests&quot; demand that both the criminal and civil cases proceed undelayed. In many cases, judges agree to delay a civil case until a criminal case is over.    However, the judge added that she did want to &quot;limit any spillover&quot; from the SEC case to the criminal one. Thus, she barred the SEC from releasing to the U.S. Attorney any documents or pretrial testimony produced by Mr. Grossman or the other six defendants in the SEC case. She also ordered all transcripts of such testimony sealed.    Steven M. Kaplan, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the Grossman criminal case, said the ruling &quot;won't have an effect on our ability to prosecute the case.&quot;    Other lawyers theorized the Grossman case is straightforward and the SEC doesn't have a lot of evidence the U.S. Attorney needs. &quot;The U.S. Attorney is always prepared to litigate its own cases or develop its own evidence,&quot; said Harvey Pitt, a former SEC general counsel who represents Ivan F. Boesky in his insider-trading case, which is unrelated to this one.    But another prominent lawyer said the ruling puts Mr. Grossman in a &quot;real bind,&quot; because anything he says in the SEC case can be used against him in the criminal case. This lawyer, who asked not to be identified, stressed that the U.S. Attorney could always petition to remove the &quot;wall&quot; if it thinks that is necessary to obtain evidence.    Mr. Grossman's attorney, Irving Seidman, couldn't be reached yesterday for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
