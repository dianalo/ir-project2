At the same time, the ethics panel faced a possible expansion ofits investigation of the speaker, requesting court records from aTexas fraud trial where Wright's name has surfaced and scheduling ameeting for Wednesday to decide whether to pursue a gas drillingventure that proved lucrative to Wright.   Wright's new eight-member legal defense team filed a series ofmotions with the ethic committee, asking for access to committeedocuments and witnesses and seeking to bar private contact betweenthe panel and its outside counsel, Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan.   Other motions were being prepared asking that the most seriouscharges against Wright be dismissed because they are based onfaulty reading of House rules.   ``I think Mr. Wright will be totally cleared in any fair trialbefore his peers,'' said Stephen D. Susman, a Houston lawyerbrought in to bolster the speaker's defense team.   In a blunt attack on Phelan, Wright said his attorneys ``havebeen profoundly shocked by the lack of professionalism andprevalence of distortion and inaccuracy contained in the Phelanreport'' and called the committee's investigation ``one-sided.''   He also said the 12 ethics committee members attended fewinterviews of witnesses. ``It has rendered them totally dependenton Mr. Phelan's interpretation and his summary of theinvestigation,'' Wright said.   And on one issue _ whether his wife, Betty, earned the$18,000-a-year salary she was paid by Fort Worth developer GeorgeMallick from 1979 through 1984 _ Phelan ignored testimony ofanother Mallick employee and concluded Mrs. Wright worked only 12days in four years, Wright said.   ``That's a lie, a falsehood, a distortion and amisrepresentation of the testimony that was given,'' he charged.   But committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and other panelmembers said Wright was wrong in contending Phelan had misled thecommittee.   ``I'm very proud of the way they (the panel) have conductedthemselves and thoroughly digested everything made available tothem,'' Dixon said.   Asked whether he was disturbed by Wright's strategy of attackingPhelan, Dixon said he was not, but added: ``I'm glad you recognizethat that is the strategy.''   Panel member Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said he had personallysat in on more than 50 hours of depositions and said most committeemembers had read all or nearly of the interview transcriptscompiled during the investigation.   ``To charge that Mr. Phelan has distorted this is to assume thecommittee hasn't done its homework,'' Craig said. ``I think thecommittee has done its homework very well.''   The panel scheduled a meeting for Wednesday to discuss whetherto pursue a flurry of additional charges surrounding Wright,including whether the speaker improperly benefited last year from agas-drilling venture in Sabine Lake that yielded him a quick$170,000 in profits.   A source familiar with the investigation, who spoke on conditionof anonymity, also said the committee has asked for transcripts andexhibits from a criminal fraud trial in Dallas in which Wright'sname showed up in the corner of a $1,000 check given as acontribution in 1985 to a political action committee by the wife ofa savings and loan executive.   Although Wright is not directly involved in the trial, it raisesagain the issue of whether he tried to exert improper influence onbehalf of the Sandamp;L industry. The ethics committee already has lookedat similar questions but did not bring charges.   ``We just can't get our platter cleared off before more is piledonto it,'' said Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the panel's seniorRepublican.   Wright's defense team, meanwhile, was seeking to reduce the 69formal counts of alleged rules violations before the speaker goesto a trial-like disciplinary hearing before the ethics panel,probably next month.   Wright is charged with evading House limits on outside earnedincome through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and with improperlyaccepting some $145,000 in gifts from Mallick, who has been deemedby the committee as having a direct interest in legislation beforeCongress.   But Wright's attorneys argued that a strict reading of the rulespermits unlimited book royalties to be collected by a House member.They also sought to make the case that Mallick had no directinterest in legislation as defined by the rules, and that thereforeany ``gifts'' from him to the Wrights would be acceptable.   They contended Phelan misread the history behind the rules andbrought charges when none were warranted. Phelan's charges amountto a rewriting of the rules, the defense lawyers said.   Tuesday's motions included an effort to formally isolate Phelanfrom the ethics panel by arguing he now takes on the role ofprosecutor and the committee should therefore limit its privatecontact with him to maintain objectivity.   The motions all must be ruled on by the ethics committee.</TEXT></DOC>
