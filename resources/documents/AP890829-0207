De la Garza, D-Texas, said Monday that his five-day visit made itclear to him that the Soviet Union is a long way from becomingself-sufficient in grain production and will continue to turn to theUnited States for that commodity.   He said the Soviet Union also could use other U.S. items but hasa hard time getting them because Soviet currency is not accepted andthe United States has shown little interest in Soviet products otherthan vodka.   ``Everything they need for the comfort of the creature, we couldsell them,'' said de la Garza. ``But they have no hard currency.''   Agriculture Department officials say the Soviets buy Americangrain with dollars that they can get by drawing upon their goldreserves.   De la Garza said that a better understanding is developingbetween the United States and U.S.S.R.   ``We need to look at how we can reshape our relations so we canbuy and sell,'' he said. ``We need to remove the feeling that all wewant to do is sell, sell, sell.''   He said the first imports may be ``symbolic'' but would go a longway toward achieving an arrangement that shows trade ``is a two-waystreet.''   The Soviets have an agreement with the United States that theywill buy at least 9 million tons of grain before Sept. 30. They havealready purchased 21.7 million tons of grain and corn and another 1million tons of sorghum, says the Agriculture Department.   Agriculture Committee members Reps. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., JerryHuckaby, D-La., Robin Tallon, D-S.C., Claude Harris, D-Ala. andDavid Dreier, R-Calif., accompanied de la Garza on the trip.   They did not see Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev but met withother top officials to discuss agricultural reform and enhancedtrade between the two countries. They also visited cooperative farmsand markets.</TEXT></DOC>
