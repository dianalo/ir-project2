(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A $16 million plan filed in federalbankruptcy court Tuesday seeks to end a multibillion dollar battlebetween former financier Marvin Warner and creditors claiming lossesfrom a bank collapse that threw the Ohio thift industry into atailspin, attorneys said.   Under the plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, Warner wouldimmediately pay $10 million and make three annual $2 millionpayments beginning with the first anniversary of the plan's approval.   Warner, 70, the target of a flood of lawsuits following thecollapse of his Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank in March1985, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 1987against creditors seeking more than $4.5 billion.   A motion filed with the proposal states that approval ``wouldsettle virtually all adversary proceedings and litigation related tothis bankruptcy case.''   Warner, the former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, will also payall legal fees and administrative costs, and an estimated $2 millionin taxes associated with liquidation of assets to pay the settlement.   The creditors agreeing to the settlement include: Ohio DepositGuarantee Fund, which went bankrupt because it insured Home State;American Savings andamp; Loan Assocation of Florida; Thomas Tew, a trusteeat the defunct ESM Government Securities; Fidata Corp. and severalcommunities that invested with ESM such as Beaumont, Texas, ClarkCounty, Nev., and Harrisburg and Dauphin County, Pa.   They will be paid a pro-rated share of the $16 million, attorneyssaid.   Also filed was a motion asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge GeorgeProctor to convert the case back to a Chapter 11 reorganization casefrom a Chapter 7 liquidation case. Proctor converted Warner'sbankruptcy case to liquidation on July 31.   Court officials say they do not know how the proposal wouldaffect a hearing scheduled Thursday to deal with an earlier motionto reconvert the case to Chapter 11.   The pact must be approved by Proctor and Hamilton County, Ohio,Common Pleas Judge Richard Niehaus, who will be asked to reduce a$22 million restitution order in 1987 to cover losses from the HomeState collapse.   ``Warner will be left essentially with his farm,'' which islocated in Ocala, said Jack R. Pigman, an attorney for Connie J.Harris Smallwood, superintendent of Ohio's Division of Savings andLoan Association.   But Niehaus, who presided at Warner's 1985 criminal convictionresulting from the Home State collapse, has been firm so far inupholding the restitution figure.   Warner said Friday he decided to pursue a settlement because ofthe pressure the court proceedings have placed on his family.   ``My family, my wife and children have suffered and have sufferedenough,'' said Warner, who now lives on a 153-acre horse farm.``Were it up to me alone, I would continue the battle of redemptionwith the last ounce of my strength.''   Pigman said under the settlement, Ohio will get about $8 million.Coupled with funds recovered in other Home State legal actions, thestate will have collected over $100 million. And there are stillsources of additional funds, he said.   The state paid out $129 million to reimburse Home Statedepositors, float bonds needed to sell Home State to other banks andresolve the savings and loan crisis that saw 70 Ohio thriftstemporarily closed in 1985.   Warner was convicted on Ohio felony charges in Home State'scollapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial.He is appealing the state conviction and the restitution order.   Home State collapsed four days after Fort Lauderdale-based ESMwas shut down by federal regulators for insolvency. Home State hadinvested heavily with ESM through securities trade and lost $144million when ESM was closed.   Settlement talks, going on since January, picked up speed lastweek after Ronald Mowrey, a former FBI agent and Tallahasseeattorney, was appointed to begin liquidating Warner's assets.   Mowrey conducted an inventory of Warner's Ohio farm near inClermont County last week.</TEXT></DOC>
