These data will help to fill that void. Selectedgroups of Los Alamos employees were invited to participate in the studywhich involved the collection of at least 400 cm/sup 3/ of urine. Includedin these groups were: 1. Chemists who work exclusively with uranium;2. Machinists who worked exclusively with uranium; 3. Chemists in theoccupational health laboratory; 4. Industrial hygiene field engineers;and, 5. Chemical research workers. Samples of drinking water associatedwith the work areas were also analyzed. The emanation method for determiningthe radium-226 in urine was used because of its sensitivity and specificity.All samples and standards were allowed to age for at least 31 days beforede-emanation and counting to issue maximum sensitivity of the measurement.These background measurements ranged in value from 0.023 to 0.177 pCi/400cm/sup 3/ of urine.</TEXT></DOC>
