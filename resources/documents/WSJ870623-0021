They've recently been pushing up Occidental stock, despite the corporate patriarch's record of outliving predictions of his departure.    Hopes of a future takeover or restructuring of Occidental have inspired some analysts to calculate a break-up value for the company. While some analysts still praise Dr. Hammer's ability to build a giant company through acquisitions, many of them feel that the parts separately are worth much more than the whole.    &quot;When you have an 89-year-old chief executive, you're going to have more speculation about a takeover,&quot; says Bruce Lazier, an analyst at Prescott Ball. He recently valued Occidental's assets at $55 a share. An Occidental spokesman says Wall Street estimates of the company's worth range from $44 to $64 a share. Yesterday, the stock closed at 37 1/4.    Recent reports that Dr. Hammer slipped in the bathtub and cracked some ribs have added a couple of points to the stock, analysts say. The shares have also been helped by speculation that Occidental would sell all or part of its meat-packing business, IBP, formerly Iowa Beef, enabling it to reduce its heavy debts.    An Occidental spokesman says Dr. Hammer &quot;fell in the tub&quot; last Monday morning &quot;and broke a rib&quot; but will return to his office by mid-week. The spokesman won't comment on the IBP rumor, but analysts think Occidental will sell within a few months sell a 49% interest in the unit to the public for $600 million or so.    Because of the injury, Dr. Hammer appeared last Monday with a cane to host a luncheon in Los Angeles for Sen. Albert Gore Jr., Democratic presidential candidate, the spokesman says. Speculation about Dr. Hammer's health might also have been fueled by his failure to appear in Washington last Thursday to receive a medal from President Reagan for his sponsorship of the arts, the spokesman adds. Doctors advised the Occidental chairman not to fly to Washington, the spokesman says.    Some speculators anticipate really big gains in Occidental's shares when the reign of its powerful chief ends.    Dr. Hammer &quot;won't let go of the reins&quot; to an acquirer and probably won't sell major assets to buy back stock, says Fred Leuffer, a C.J. Lawrence analyst. In recent years, Occidental instead has issued stock and bought companies, frets one speculator.    Occidental would be an ideal takeover candidate, analysts say. They think its valuable U.S. and foreign oil and gas reserves might tempt an acquirer. And it has several salable units that could be sold or spun off to reduce the acquisition cost, says Norman Weinger, an investment strategist at Oppenheimer.    Prescott's Mr. Lazier thinks Occidental might appeal to a big multinational oil company. It's among the few energy companies that has been adding to proven reserves and will continue to do so over the next five years, he says.    He values Occidental's oil and gas assets and acreage at $8 billion. He thinks its MidCon pipeline unit is worth $4.8 billion; its chemicals unit, $2.3 billion; and its agribusiness, mainly IBP, $1.4 billion. Including other assets, he puts a total value on the company of $11.3 billion, after subtracting long-term obligations of $6.6 billion.    Occidental wouldn't be the first company to be dismantled after the reign of a powerful executive. The former Diamond Shamrock was recently split into separate energy-producing and refining-marketing units. Allegis, the old UAL, seems likely to be split into separate airline, rent-a-car and hotel assets.    Occidental shares aren't risk-free. The company's earnings haven't covered its $2.50-a-share annual dividend for some years, fueling speculation about a dividend cut. It's fighting two big lawsuits involving claims of more than $1 billion. It will incur losses on operations in 1987 and earn relatively little in 1988, says C.J. Lawrence's Mr. Leuffer. He thinks the stock would trade &quot;in the low 30s&quot; but for takeover talk.    Occidental says it will keep paying its dividend from cash flow. Excluding proceeds from asset sales, cash flow in 1987 will be about $7 a share, says Prescott's Mr. Lazier. Philip Wallach, Occidental's investor relations officer, says he expects the lawsuits to be settled for no more than $50 million. Occidental is appealing a $412 million award to Coastal Corp.    Bernard Picchi, a Salomon analyst, thinks Occidental stock will do well on fundamentals alone. The 6.7% dividend yield is greater than many oil companies' and Occidental stands to profit if energy prices rise, he says. He thinks investors will eventually pay a premium for Occidental's &quot;fabulous exploration record.&quot;    &quot;There isn't huge downside in the stock even if Dr. Hammer lives to be 120,&quot; Mr. Picchi says.    ---   Occidental Petroleum   (NYSE; Stock Symbol: OXY)   Business: Oil and gas, pipelines, chemicals and meatpacking.
