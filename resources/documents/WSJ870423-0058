Opponents of the death penalty have said the case may be the last broad challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty in many states.    In a 5-4 decision, the high court upheld a death sentence, imposed under Georgia's capital-punishment law, against a black man convicted of killing a white policeman in Atlanta during a robbery.    The high court reviewed a University of Iowa law professor's statistical study of more than 2,000 Georgia death-penalty cases in the 1970s showing that defendants who killed white victims were 11 times more likely to be sentenced to death than those who killed blacks. Even allowing for other factors, the study said, those who kill whites are at least four times more likely to be sentenced to death. When the defendant was black, the disparity increased, the study showed. Georgia officials denied that the state's death penalty discriminates on the basis of race.    In an opinion written by Justice Lewis Powell, the court said the general evidence in the study wasn't proof that the death sentence imposed in the specific case of Warren McCleskey in 1982 was based on, or motivated by, racial discrimination.    The ruling is significant well beyond the Georgia case. The study on the Georgia death penalty is one of three recent surveys done by professors around the country. Together, these studies suggest there is a racial disparity in death sentences under the laws of 10 states accounting for more than half of the nearly 1,900 death row inmates in the U.S.    Had the Supreme Court found the statistical evidence proved that the Georgia law worked in an unconstitutional manner, it would have cast considerable doubt on the validity of the laws of those 10 states, as well as the other 22 states in which inmates are awaiting execution.    Law enforcement and conservative groups praised the ruling. &quot;Had this case gone the other way,&quot; said Daniel Popeo, general counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest group, &quot;it would have opened a Pandora's box of statistical and sociological challenges to every criminal conviction across America, not just for capital punishment.&quot; Mr. Popeo, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, said the Georgia statistical study was inconclusive. &quot;There are statistics that go both ways,&quot; he said.    John Boger, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. in New York, which represents McCleskey and many other death row inmates, called the ruling a &quot;serious defeat&quot; for lawyers who have been attacking the fairness of the death penalty.    Since the Supreme Court upheld some state death-penalty laws in 1976, after invalidating earlier laws in 1972, capital-punishment foes have mounted a series of challenges -- some focusing on details of specific cases or state practices, others making broader attacks on the fairness of many state death-penalty laws.    The effort rejected by the high court yesterday, Mr. Boger said, was &quot;the last major piece of litigation that might have struck down many states' laws in toto. . . . It's fair to say we don't have any other major challenges at this time.&quot;    But he said the legal defense fund will press state legislatures to recognize that there is racial bias in their death-penalty systems and to change their laws. He also said there &quot;will be many, many other challenges that may affect five or 10 cases at a time.&quot;    McCleskey based his challenge on the 14th Amendment's guarantee of &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; and on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot;    Justice Powell's opinion rejected both grounds. The court said that violations of the 14th Amendment must involve an intent to discriminate, and that there was no evidence of this in McCleskey's case.    The high court also said that &quot;apparent disparities in sentencing are an inevitable part of our criminal justice system&quot; and the Constitution doesn't require that a state eliminate every &quot;demonstrable disparity.&quot; Many disparities, the court said, stem from the discretion the system gives to judges and juries. &quot;Discretion . . . offers substantial benefits to the criminal defendant,&quot; the court said.    If the justices accepted the argument in the McCleskey challenge, the court said, judges might face studies showing bias based on other factors that influence a jury, such as &quot;the defendant's facial characteristics, or the physical attractiveness of the defendant or the victim.&quot;    Justices William Brennan, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens wrote dissenting opinions, and the first two were joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall. The dissenters said the majority had turned its back on evidence of racial discrimination. The McCleskey message, Justice Brennan said, &quot;is a disturbing one to a society that has formally repudiated racism.&quot;    General Dynamics Case   The high court ruled 6-3 that a company that runs its own employee health-insurance plan can't take a business deduction from federal income taxes for money placed in reserve to cover the projected cost of medical care delivered late in the tax year.    The high court said the employer can't take the deduction until the claims for insurance reimbursement have been filed. The deduction can't be based solely on the company's estimate.    The ruling, written by Justice Marshall, was a defeat for General Dynamics Corp. and a victory for the Internal Revenue Service. The case involved a deduction for 1972 that General Dynamics claimed in an amended return filed in 1977. The high court reversed a ruling in the company's favor by a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia.    Justice Sandra O'Connor dissented, joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens.    &quot;We're obviously disappointed by the Supreme Court decision. We had believed our position to be a strong one,&quot; a General Dynamics spokesman said.    He said the company will be required to pay the federal government &quot;several million dollars&quot; in additional taxes and interest, dating from 1975 to the present, as a result of the decision. The payment will have &quot;no material impact&quot; on the company's earnings, he added.    State Magazine Tax   By a 7-2 vote, the high court declared invalid an Arkansas sales tax that applied to general-interest magazines but exempted newspapers and religious, professional, trade and sports publications.    In an opinion written by Justice Marshall, the court said the tax violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press. The court, reversing an Arkansas Supreme Court decision that upheld the tax, said it discriminates based on the content of the publication.    The tax was challenged by Arkansas Writers' Project Inc., publisher of the monthly magazine Arkansas Times.    Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. </TEXT></DOC>
