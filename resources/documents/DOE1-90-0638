<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-0638 </DOCNO><TEXT>The purpose of this report is to provide the Project Managers (PM) ofthe US Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency (USATHAMA) InstallationRestoration Program (IRP) with an overview of the means by which varioushealth-based criteria and standards are derived and with definitionsof health risk terms frequently used in the risk assessment/risk managementscheme. Although certain chemical-specific criteria or standards mayapply directly to ambient conditions at a hazardous waste site, manyrequire adjustment to make them revelant and appropriate to the exposureconditions found at a particular site. This report will provide insightinto the means of adjusting available health-based information to provideguidance on cleanup of waste sites and will give examples to clarifythe methodologies. In particular, basic concepts for derivation of health-basedstandards and criteria for systemic toxicants and carcinogens are discussed,as well as the actual standards and criteria themselves. These includemaximum contaminant level goals, maximum contaminant levels, drinkingwater health advisories, and ambient water quality criteria for the protectionof human health. It can be seen that several basic precepts are inherentin each of the methodologies described, and an understanding of thesebasic concepts will allow the IRP PM to evaluate the chemical-specificARARs developed for cleanup of any CERCLA site. 8 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
