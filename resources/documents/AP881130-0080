U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell took the bench behindclosed doors after court security officials used electronicequipment to ``sweep'' the courtroom to satisfy themselves that nolistening devices had been planted.   The hearing began a day after Gesell upheld all but one of thekey charges that the former National Security Council aide illegallydiverted U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels andlied to Congress.   With virtually all the pre-trial motions disposed of, the judgetoday turned his attention to the equally difficult issues posed bythe thousands of pages of classified government documents each sidewants to use as evidence in the trial.   North attended the hearing with his attorneys, Brendan V.Sullivan Jr. and Barry Simon. A plainclothes security agent whousually accompanies the retired Marine lieutenant colonel to courtwas not allowed in the courtroom.   The secret proceeding was convened to consider North's objectionsto deleting sensitive references from 350 classified documentscovering 1,000 to 2,000 pages that independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh wants to use as evidence in the case.   North contends the references to foreign countries and U.S.intelligence agents are needed for his defense along with thecontents of 40,000 other ages of classified documents.   Walsh, accusing North of trying to provoke dismissal of thecharges by threatening to disclose the secrets, wants Gesell to barthe former National Security Council aide from using any of thematerial at trial.   Gesell on Tuesday struck a wire-fraud allegation, one of thethree central charges against North, because he found it was ``apurely cumulative count'' that would require a complicated andconfusing legal instruction to the jury.   The dismissal suggests the wire-fraud charges against North'sco-defendants also may be dropped eventually. The co-defendants _former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealersAlbert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord _ arescheduled to be tried separately.   The judge rejected North's arguments that the conspiracy andembezzlement charges were legally flawed, saying: ``The indictmentclearly alleges a conspiracy which involved concealing the veryexistence of the profits of the enterprise from the start and hidingfrom Congress information relating to the conspirators' assistancefor the Contras.''   Gesell also denied defense motions to dismiss six charges thatNorth lied to congressional committees in 1985 and 1986 by falselydenying that he was covertly helping the rebels in violation of theBoland Amendments.   He said North's ``facial attack on the constitutionality of theBoland Amendments is misplaced.'' The series of provisions, namedfor Rep. Edward Boland, D-Mass., prohibited direct U.S. military aidto the Contras.   North's ``understanding as to the constitutionality of Boland inno way affords an excuse for his alleged misconduct or entitled himto obstruct the way the government was, in fact, functioning,''Gesell said.   Nor can North justify his conduct because of doubts expressed bythe Reagan administration that the Boland Amendments applied toactivities of the National Security Council staff, Gesell said.   If prosecutors deliver on their promise to prove that PresidentReagan ordered his White House staff to obey the Boland Amendments,``North's alleged unauthorized deviation from such limitations mustbe viewed as contrary to lawful government functions,'' he ruled.   The judge also rejected the defense contention tht Congressexceeded its powers in questioning the National Security Councilaide about his efforts to help the Contras.   ``North did not refuse to answer congressional queries on thegrounds that Congress had no constitutional right to query NationalSecurity Council officials,'' Gesell said. ``In fact, he is allegedto have asserted his, and the NSC's, full compliance with the BolandAmendment.''   The judge also rejected a defense argument that the chargesinfringe on the president's exclusive power to conduct diplomacy andintelligence operations.   In ruling on 34 of North's 37 pre-trial motions, Gesell hasupheld 14 of the 16 original charges against the retired Marinelieutenant colonel. It appears unlikely that he will grant threeremaining defense motions to dismiss the charges North lied toCongress on other legal grounds.   Gesell, in a separate order, refused to bar Walsh and hisassociates from today's hearing, saying that granting North'srequest ``would alter the purpose of the hearing and result infurther and wholly unnecessary delay'' of the trial, which hepreviously indicated may start in late January.</TEXT></DOC>
