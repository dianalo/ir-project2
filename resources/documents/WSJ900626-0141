The network would use a $1 billion satellite system thatwould begin broadcasts of music, information and advertisingaround the year 2000. It would require a new generation ofradios that can receive satellite broadcasts.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal generally envisions private ownership ofsatellites and radio stations in the U.S. market andgovernment ownership of satellites in foreign markets,according to people who heard a briefing on the plan.   The proposal is backed principally by the CommerceDepartment, the U.S. Information Agency and the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration. But already the plan isrunning into opposition from U.S. broadcasters, who fear thatthe proposed system would gobble up scarce broadcastfrequencies and increase competition among radio stations. Italso may kick up a storm within the Bush administration,where senior officials have fiercely opposed governmentdirection of new commercial technologies.   Even so, the system has two big advantages. It would offerbroadcasters and advertisers a way to reach a national andinternational market. And it would offer listenerscrystalline sound quality by using digital technology totransmit signals.   The Commerce Department's Office of Space Commerce hasinvited a group of government and industry officials to abreakfast today for their second, closed-door discussion ofsatellite radio. Two satellite entrepreneurs -- MartinRothblatt, president of a consulting group here called MarcorInc., and Gary Noreen, president of Radio Satellite Corp.,Pasadena, Calif.are scheduled to address the group.   &quot;Let's get started first in the U.S.,&quot; says Mr. Noreen,who proposes a system that would broadcast 10 stationsnationally in 1993. &quot;Then we can turn our system into aworld-wide system.&quot; A report of the federal effort firstappeared in Space Business News, an Arlington, Va.,newsletter.   At the first Commerce Department meeting, on April 17, H.Don Messer, USIA's satellite broadcast program manager,sketched his agency's plans for the system. According to amemo passed around at the meeting, the system would includeas many as 100 radio stations that could broadcast anywherein the world with a sound quality comparable to compactdisks. Mr. Messer's memo called the plan &quot;a fundamentallydifferent, new radio broadcasting service from satellites.&quot;   For global reach, the USIA envisions four satellites inorbit, at a total cost of $700 million. A one-satellitesystem, costing $200 million, could cover the Americas,Europe and Africa, the memo said. The USIA is pushing theplan to increase its reach geographically, to cut its costsby sharing the satellite system with commercial broadcastersand to improve its quality, said participants in the CommerceDepartment meetings. The Voice of America, for instance,broadcasts on scratchy, shortwave frequencies and wants toaugment its service with a better-resolution system.   The agency has enlisted NASA in support of its proposal.The two agencies will spend $3 million over three yearsstudying the engineering requirements of a satellite system.They also plan to seek broadcast frequencies for the systemat an international meeting in 1992 called the WorldAdministrative Radio Conference. Any communications systemthat transmits abroad needs international approval for use offoreign frequencies.   The proposal faces formidable political and technicalobstacles. Most importantly, current radios can't receivesatellite signals, so the agencies must persuademanufacturers to develop a new generation of receivers. Italso will require the Federal Communications Commission toallocate a huge number of unused or currently used broadcastfrequencies, which U.S. broadcasters will surely oppose. TheNational Association of Broadcasters, for instance, last weektried to head off the satellite system by proposing a digitaltransmission system using conventional, land-based radiotowers.   The two satellite entrepreneurs so far have made proposalsto the FCC that closely mirror aspects of the federalproposal, but that would provide service by 1994. The systemswould be privately owned.   Mr. Rothblatt, the Marcor executive, asked the FCC toapprove a $330 million plan that he calls Satellite CD RadioInc. His system would use two satellites to provide 100channels of compact-disk quality music in the U.S. startingin 1994. In an attempt to blunt opposition from broadcasters,Satellite CD reserves one-third of the channels for localbroadcasters. Listeners would use radio sets with antennasthat look like cellular-phone antennas to pick up thesatellite signals, he says.   &quot;NASA and Commerce being behind this concept gives peoplemore technical confidence that it will work,&quot; Mr. Rothblattsays. The two agencies declined to comment on the system.   Mr. Noreen proposes something more modest. He asked theFCC to approve construction of a $1 million earth station inPasadena to transmit 10 channels of music, as well as pagingdata and telephone calls to a satellite that the FCC hasalready approved for launch in 1993. Mr. Noreen is a partnerin that satellite venture, called American Mobile SatelliteCorp.   The California entrepreneur says his system at firstwouldn't offer compact-disk quality sound, but rather wouldoffer a package of services. He envisions a car radio thatcould pick up FM-quality satellite radio stations and alsoact as a pager and a mobile phone. He says the receiver couldbe on sale by Christmas of 1993 and cost about $200 more thantop-of-the line conventional radios.   The two entrepreneurs already are taking potshots at eachother. Mr. Noreen calls the Satellite CD proposal &quot;silly&quot; andgrandiose. Mr. Rothblatt counters that Mr. Noreen's idea istoo limited. &quot;It's geared to truckers -- people who likeradio and a pager rolled into one,&quot; he says.   For its part, the FCC has asked for comment on theSatellite CD proposal. &quot;It's getting a lot of discussion inand out of the agency,&quot; says Ray Laforge, an FCC engineer whois attending the Commerce Department meetings.</TEXT></DOC>
