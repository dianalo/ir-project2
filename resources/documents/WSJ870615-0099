But while the number of imperiled farm banks has declined in recent quarters, economists, bankers and bank regulators say they don't expect any substantial improvement in the agricultural economy soon.    Indeed, should the government pare its huge support package for farmers and their lenders -- including subsidies, regulator forbearance for troubled banks, and holding farm land off the market -- agriculture could head into another tailspin. &quot;The government programs, in a number of ways, are serving to stablize conditions,&quot; said Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.    Federal subsidies are expected to account this year for nearly three-fourths of farmers' incomes nationwide, which Mr. Drabenstott estimates at about $35 billion.    That infusion of money is helping many farmers and, thus, lenders hang on. According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks likely to fail has been declining since a year ago.    Farm banks are defined as those with 25% or more of their loans to farmers. And those with problem loans exceeding their capital -- a leading indicator of failure -- fell to 184 as of December 31, 1986, from a peak of 230 last June 30, the Fed data show.    Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said that while the number of farm bank failures has continued to rise, those failures are accounting for a smaller portion of bank failures this year than last year. And Mr. Drabenstott said that total problem loans of U.S. farm banks have declined during the last year.    A slowing in the decline of farm land values, which underpin most agricultural loans, is helping many banks. Farm land prices are down 55% nationally from their 1981 peak, Mr. Drabenstott said, but in the Midwest grain belt those values didn't drop in the first quarter. And sales, though still only a small fraction of the inventory of land held by lenders and others, are picking up.    The volume of sales &quot;still is small relative to inventories yet to move through the market,&quot; Mr. Drabenstott said. &quot;But the important change is psychological.&quot;    A 117-acre farm sold recently near Shipman, Ill., for $1,000 an acre. Six months earlier, said Tim Bass, a farm lender at Citizens State Bank in Shipman, &quot;nothing was moving&quot; even with listed prices of $650 to $700 an acre.    Citizens State Bank has about twice as much in problem loans as it has capital, took a big loss last year, and is counting on federal programs to keep about half its borrowers going. &quot;Either a man is fairly solid or he's in real trouble,&quot; Mr. Bass said. For those in trouble, &quot;the farm program is keeping them in business.&quot;    The bank was also able to get Farmers Home Administration guarantees for about $3 million in troubled loans, shifting the risk to the federal agency.    First National Bank of Kiester, Minn., managed a small first-quarter profit despite a big burden of problem loans. &quot;We're very dependent on government subsidies,&quot; said Donald Nickel, a vice president. He said about three-fourths of his borrowers need the federal help to keep going. &quot;It's not a real pretty picture.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
