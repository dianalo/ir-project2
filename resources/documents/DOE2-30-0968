Just as a series of workstations is used to manufactureautomobiles in lieu of using one robot for all tasks, laboratory automationcells can be dedicated to specialized sample preparation steps and integratedto achieve a flexible sample preparation assembly line. In this A/C interface,the authors describe a flexible approach to laboratory sample preparationthat takes advantage of the assembly line concept of manufacturing automationand removes the high-volume or manual change over requirements of single-procedureautomation. This task is accomplished by breaking all of the targetedprocedures down into classes and subclasses of generic analytical steps,and then automating and networking these individual steps - which arecommon to many different procedures - into a single integrated system.One of the analytical modules, a liquid-handling workstation, will bedescribed in detail. Workstations for other analytical steps and someof the technical barriers that must be overcome to achieve them willalso be discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
