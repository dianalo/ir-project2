In the case when quark evolution is neglected, the probabilitydistribution becomes wider as energy increases, in agreement with experimentaldata. The authors find that moments fit the data remarkably well withan increasing initial number of gluons and decreasing initial numberof quarks. In this model, they predict the upper bounds for the probabilitydistribution and multiplicity moments. They also give theoretical predictionsfor the multiplicities and moments for Tevartron Collider energies, indicatingthe slow narrowing of the probability distribution in this energy range.</TEXT></DOC>
