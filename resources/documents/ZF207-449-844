 If reports in thepapers are to be believed, I gather it is his view that these are parloustimes both for the electronics industry and for the nation at large.andP;  In hiswords, &quot;US high technology is at a critical point in its evolution&quot;.andM;Evidently, the purpose of the AEA president's talk was to sound the trumpetfor an associationsponsored report that explores ways of dealing withproblems besetting the US high-tech sector.andP;  I was particularly intrigued bya recommendation that calls for the development of &quot;joint industry/governmentstrategies to advance US progress in highdefinition television,semiconductors, supercomputers, superconductivity and software&quot;.andP;  (Emphasismine.)andM;Yes, the government is definitely invited to the party, and it is respondingwith signals that indicate it is more than willing to participate-at least aslong as it doesn't have to spend any money A couple of days after theircoverage of the AEA executive's speech, the newspapers reported the Bushadministration was preparing to propose that federal antitrust laws &quot;berelaxed significantly&quot; so that such industry stalwarts as Motorola, ATandamp;T andIBM can work together on the development and production of high-technologyequipment, beginning with high-definition television.andM;If you are beginning to discern here a certain resemblance to the radiobroadcasting scenario we explored in this space last month well, that's thepoint.andP;  Radio broadcasting in the US was developed with the help of just suchan accommodation between the industry and government, made under theexigencies of World War 1.andP;  Furthermore, once the government got itselfinvolved in broadcasting, it never really got back out.andP;  All of whichsuggests that those persons in high-tech industries who are now solicitingthe assistance of the federal government might reflect upon Aesops tale ofthe kindly Arab who allowed his camel to shelter its nose in his tent, onlyto end up with the entire beast inside.andP;  (Historically, the government hasdemonstrated that it can be a very persistent camel indeed.)andM;Europeans have long marveled at the ambivalence with which we Americansgenerally regard our federal government.andP;  While we see ourselves as fiercelyindependent and determinedly individualistic, we have nonetheless created apatchwork of social programs linked with government regulation that makesours a mammoth welfare state-although many of us wouldn't be caught deadcalling it that.andP;  What's true for individual citizens has been true forbusiness as well.andP;  Though laissez faire may be its ostensible philosophy USbusiness has seldom been shy about enlisting the government's assistance whenit has perceived that its own interests would be advanced by doing so.andP;  Theresult is the jerry-built structure of agencies that today constitute thegovernment's interface with industryandM;The federal government has always played a role in the affairs of Americanbusiness, of course.andP;  We have had a US Patent Office since the early days ofthe republic, for example.andP;  It was only after the Civil War, however, thatgovernment began its involvement in business in earnest.andP;  The construction oftranscontinental rail lines was expedited by government subsidies on a scalepreviously unknown in this country, and from that moment forward thefloodgates have remained open.andP;  Mining, ranching, farming-all requiredgovernment land to start with and, before very long, other types ofgovernment assistance as well.andM;At first, this new sphere of activity inspired little in the way ofgovernment regulation.andP;  Soon, though, a mounting public outcry demanded thatsomething be done about the exorbitant rates charged customers and about thecorporate infighting that by the 1870s had become endemic in the railroadindustry.andP;  State legislatures responded by creating commissions charged withlooking into perceived abuses.andP;  These were the ancestors of the independentregulatory agencies that have since proliferated at both the state andfederal levels.andM;Nineteenth-century rail magnates did not take kindly to what they regarded asunwarranted government interference in their affairs, They found a powerfulally in the federal judiciary, which methodically savaged first stateregulatory legislation, then Congressional attempts to achieve the same end.andO;Ultimately, however, the principle of government regulation of businessactivity won out.andP;  Often as not, as in the case of radio broadcasting, it wasindustry itself that sought the government's involvement.andM;Thus did we come to witness the establishment of a sizeable group ofgovernment agencies that, at first glance, scarcely seem to fit into theConstitutional structure outlined by the Framers.andP;  Nominally part of theexecutive branch of government, they in effect create laws under powersdelegated to them by the legislatures and, in addition, exercise judicialfunctions.andP;  Most frequently, their official name will include the wordcommission, but sometimes it is board or agency instead.andP;  (For convenience, Iwill use the term commission in the discussion that follows.) Whatever theirmonikers, true independent regulatory agencies share certain characteristics.andM;Typically, their members are appointed for staggered terms, and only acertain proportion of them can be members of the same political party; thisis supposed to make them &quot;independent&quot; of the executive and the legislature.andO;The enactment creating a commission will contain general provisions thatindicate its area of authority and competence, but will leave it to thecommission itself, in Chief Justice Marshall's 1825 phrase, &quot;to fill up thedetails&quot;-in other words, to legislate the specifics.andP;  The law creating acommission will also provide that it can resolve disputes between partiesunder its authority- meaning it can exercise judicial power.andM;In short, an independent commission makes the rules that are to apply withinits designated area of authority, enforces them, and adjudicates contendingclaims that may arise under them.andP;  Now this does not mean you should simplyforget what you were taught in school about the separation of powers in ourgovernment.andP;  It is merely that when we enter the never-never land of theindependent commissions, matters become a good deal more complicated.andM;The Constitutional requirements the courts have seized upon in the past todecimate regulatory commissions still have to be met, however.andP;  Thus, if thelegislation setting up a commission is so sketchy or vague that it fails toprovide adequate guidelines for the commissioners to follow, the courts can,at least in theory, find the whole shebang unconstitutional as an improperdelegation of legislative power-though in practice they have rarely done soin recent years (and I've seen some pretty vague statutes, believe me).andP;  Tomeet the requirement that everyone who comes under the commission'sjurisdiction be afforded due process of law, there must ordinarily be someprovision for giving all the parties in a dispute a reasonable opportunity tobe heard, as well as for subsequent appeal of a disadvantageous ruling to thecourts.andM;Despite these safeguards, history has demonstrated that certain recurringproblems tend to plague independent commissions.andP;  In our day they have onceagain come under fire, this time from quarters outside the judiciary.andM;For one thing, independent government commissions seem to be chronicallyafflicted by uncertainty as to the nature of their mission.andP;  Increasingly,they are criticized for assuming the role of nurturer of -if not servantto-the industry they are ostensibly charged with regulating.andP;  (In thisregard, most people now seem to have forgotten that the initial impetusfo&quot;deregulation&quot; of business did not come from Ronald Reagan'smarket-oriented administration, but is instead a legacy of Jimmy Carter'sneopopulists.andP;  It strikes me as ironic that the dismantling of governmentregulation was set in motion by the intellectual progeny of the nineteenthcentury's agrarian radicals-who started us down the road to regulation in thefirst place.)andM;Undoubtedly, lack of steadfastness in the commissions' approach to theindustries they are supposedly regulating is tied to personnel recruitmentpractices that are common in both industry and government.andP;  It is not unusualfor people working in the industry in question to be appointed to theregulatory commission-they have the relevant expertise, after all.andP;  Withequal frequency, commissioners move to better-paid positions in that industryupon expiration of their terms.andP;  (Contrast this, if you will, with thesituation that obtains with respect to federal judges, who are appointed forlife.andP;  Of course, if the taxpayers don't start paying them better, we couldsoon see judges begin to mimic the commissioners' behavior.)andM;In my opinion, one of the most troubling defects in this system ofindependent commissions results from thefact that commissioners are called onto play three distinct roles: they must be administrators, legislators, andjudges.andP;  They thus lack clear-cut ethical mandates that would spell out whatthey should and should not do in the exercise of their functions.andP;  Forexample, it is considered perfectly proper for citizens to attempt to exertinfluence on legislators so as to obtain the passage of laws that arefavorable in their eyes.andP;  On the other hand, it is grossly improper-in factin many instances a crime-to try to do the same thing with judgesdeliberating a decision.andP;  If commissioners are supposed to act as bothlegislators and judges, which of these approaches should citizens follow? Ifyou have an easy answer, please let Washington in on it.andM;Finally for these and other reasons, commissions have too often turned out tobe ineffective.andP;  This point leads us back to the Federal CommunicationsCommission, which grew out of the 1927 Radio Commission.andP;  In 1934, to replacethe old Radio Act, Congress passed a new law giving an independent commissionauthority not just over broadcasting, but over all means ofcommunication-including telephones.andP;  Congress probably did not suspect thatthe task it was assigning the new FCC would turn out to be overwhelming.andM;By the 1960s, it was apparent that the FCC was no longer any match for ATandamp;Twhich had become too large for any regulatory agency to supervise.andP;  Whatresulted was an antitrust action that lead to the breakup of ATandamp;T and tosupervision of what remains of the former company by a federal court,effectively relieving the FCC of a major portion of its responsibilities.andO;Subsequently, both the courts and Congress acted to remove cable TV from theFCC's realm of authority, and Reagan-appointed commissioners themselvesjettisoned a good many FCC regulations directed at broadcasting.andM;There is still some life left in the FCC, though.andP;  Just try putting a&quot;pirate&quot; station on the air-as naive students do from time to time-and youwill quickly be reminded of that.andP;  In its standard-setting role, moreover,the commission has become the fulcrum by way of which a sizeable chunk of theUS electronics industry hopes to be catapulted into highdefinitiontelevision.andM;Whatever else you might say about it, the FCC is there.andP;  From the point ofview of the Congress, therefore, to what agency would it be more logical toentrust future government stewardship of the nation's high technology? Andif, in the national interest, it should be judged that inefficient intermuralbickering such as that presently going on over standards for the UNIX systemmust not be left to market forces for resolution, where better to decide thematter than at the FCC?andM;I'm not saying this is definitely going to happen, of course.andP;  It's the sortof thing that could happen, however, especially if we focus single-mindedlyon technological advancement without pausing to contemplate changes in thelaws and the regulatory climate that technological advancement mightnecessitate.andP;  One prediction I will make, however.andP;  Before their careers areover, an awful lot of people now working in the computing industry will haveto adjust to a governmental and legal climate that is certain to be radicallydifferent from the one we know now.andP;  The old Boy Scout motto-be prepared-is agood one to keep in mind.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law He also has served as an administrative law judge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
