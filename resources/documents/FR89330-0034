The Department has now completed that administrativereview in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``theTariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS''), asprovided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, forconsumption on or after that date is now classified solely according tothe appropriate HTS item numbers.Imports covered by this review are shipments of pressure sensitive plastictape measuring over 1\3/8\ inches in width and not exceeding 4 millimetersin thickness, currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 3919.90.20,3919.90.50, 4811.21.00, 4821.90.20, 4823.11.00, and 5906.10.00. HTS itemnumbers are provided for Commerce and Customs purposes. The written descriptionremains dispositive.The review covers two manufacturers and/or exporters of Italian pressuresensitive plastic tape to the United States and the period October 1, 1986through September 30, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results andtentative determination to revoke in part. We received comments from thepetitioner, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (``3M''), and three respondents,N.A.R., S.p.A. (``NAR''), Boston, S.p.A. (``Boston''), and Manuli, S.p.A.(``Manuli''). On September 2, 1988, we received additional comments fromNAR; we are not considering these comments because they were untimely submitted.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>3M urges the Department to deny Manuli's request forrevocation because, in its rebuttal brief dated September 6, 1988, Manuliacknowledged one unreported U.S. sale during the previous review period(October 1, 1985-September 30, 1986). In the administrative review of thatperiod Manuli had reported no shipments. On September 20, 1988, Manuliprovided data concerning this sale and a contemporaneous home market saleand requested that the Department determine whether there was any dumpingmargin for this sale. Manuli suggests that if the Department treats thatperiod as one in which there were no sales at less than foreign marketvalue, that would result in two consecutive periods of no less-than-foreign-market-valuesales (1984-86) and one period of no sales (1986-87), and Manuli wouldthus still qualify for revocation. Further, 3M urges the Department toexamine entry documentation provided by the U.S. Customs Service concerningtwo of Manuli's sales which may have occurred in review periods for whichManuli claimed no shipments to the U.S.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We will not consider Manuli's request todetermine whether dumping margins exist for the unreported shipment since,due to Manuli's inconsistent reporting, the Department cannot be sure thatsales are no longer being made at less than foreign market value and, therefore,we cannot be satisfied that there is no likelihood of resumption of salesat less than foreign market value. <T3>See </T3>19 CFR 353.54(a). Therefore, we hereby rescind the tentativedetermination to revoke in part with respect to Manuli. Since the unreportedU.S. sale remains unliquidated, we will instruct the U.S. Customs Serviceto assess the highest cash deposit rate for a reviewed firm (6.39 percent)in that review period, consistent with our policy concerning unreportedshipments. Further, we have examined 3M's allegations that two additionalManuli sales occurred during a review period for which Manuli claimed noshipments, and have determined that we included these sales in our previousreview of the period October 1, 1984-September 30, 1985.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>3M argues that the Department's proposal to revokethe antidumping finding with respect to Boston and Manuli without examiningsales up to the date of the tentative revocation (August 5, 1988), referredto as the ``gap period'', is contrary to the Department's regulations andpolicy. Manuli argues that the Department need not review the ``gap period''and that the Tariff Act gives the Department discretion in determiningthe effective date of a revocation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>For Manuli, see our position on <T3>Comment 1</T3>. Before determining whether to revoke Boston, however,we will examine sales up to the date of the tentative determination torevoke in part (August 5, 1988), consistent with 19 CFR 353.54(f) and theDepartment's policy. Should that revocation be made final, the effectivedate will be August 5, 1988.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>3M requests that the Department conduct on-site verificationsto determine whether Boston and Manuli made no shipments during the reviewperiod. Manuli argues that the Department's procedure for verifying noshipments, that is, relying on the U.S. Customs Service to notify the Departmentof any imports, satisfies the statutory requirement.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In making a final determination concerningrevocation of Boston, the Department will verify, to the extent it deemsappropriate, the information provided in support of this revocation. Asfor Manuli, see our position on <T3>Comment 1</T3>.<T3>Comment 4</T3>: 3M urges the Department not to revoke Boston or Manulibecause neither had demonstrated that there is no likelihood of resumptionof less-than-fair sales. Manuli argues that the fact that it has not soldthis merchandise to the U.S. since April 1984 (except for the sale in October1985, discussed in <T3>Comment 1</T3>), that it has closed its U.S. subsidiary (Manuli U.S.A.),and that it has received <T3>de minimis </T3>or no margins in two of the four years and a small(0.97%) margin in one of the other years, are sufficient evidence and assurancethat there is no likelihood of resumption of dumping. Boston urges theDepartment to publish a final revocation for Boston because it has notsales to the United States since October 1981.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: Prior to a final revocation, we intendto review the gap period for Boston in our next review (<T3>see </T3>our position on <T3>Comment 2</T3>). Manuli is no longer eligible for revocation sincewe have rescinded our tentative revocation (<T3>see </T3>our position on <T3>Comment 1</T3>).<T3>Comment 5</T3>: 3M argues that the Department's proposed revocationof Manuli based on two years of no shipments and one year of de minimismargins is contrary to the Department's revocation policy.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: See our position on <T3>Comment 1. </T3>Since we have rescinded the tentative determinationto revoke with respect to Manuli, this argument is moot.<T3>Comment 6</T3>: NAR claims that the Department should not have includedhome market sales to end users in its calculation of foreign market value(``FMV''), since it sold exclusively to wholesalers in the United States.In addition, NAR argues that; had the Department made a yearly aggregationof all end-user sales, it would have found that higher prices were chargedto end users as a group than to wholesalers and retailers. Finally, NARargues that price and quantity cannot be the only indications of levelof trade. The Department must also look at what the customer does withthe merchandise.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We used all of NAR's home market salesbecause, as in the last review, we examined pricing practices and foundunexplained inconsistencies; that is, at times prices differed though purchasedquantities were the same, and vice-versa. We are not satisfied that theseclasses of purchasers were different, as claimed. NAR did not provide anydocumentation to support its conclusion that a yearly aggregation of end-usersales would show that prices to this group were higher than to the othercustomer categories. The Department is not required by either the statuteor the regulations compare yearly sales amounts to different customer categoriesor to determine how the customer uses the merchandise in ascertaining theappropriate levels of trade. Rather, the burden falls on the respondentto establish that different levels of trade exist and that such differencesaffect price comparability. Recently the Court of International Trade (``CIT'')upheld this position in <T3>NAR </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>slip. op. 89-12 (Ct. Int'l Trade, January 27, 1989).<T3>Comment 7</T3>: NAR argues that, for the differences-in-merchandise(``diffmer'') adjustment, rather than rejecting NAR's data and using anothermanufacturer's public data (Manuli) for the 1982-83 review period, theDepartment should use NAR's data as best information available. Alternatively,if the Department insists on using Manuli's data as best information available,the Department should make proportionate adjustments for its cost differencesaccording to each size and type of tape sold by NAR to the U.S. duringthis review period. 3M argues that the Department's decision to use bestinformation available is appropriate both because NAR did not provide thediffmer data in a timely manner and because NAR's data were deficient onseveral counts.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: As noted in our preliminary results, NAR'sdiffmer submissions contained several procedural and substantive deficienciesand various inconsistencies as outlined in the Department's memorandumdated July 19, 1988. Although NAR provided various clarifications and explanationswith respect to the diffmer adjustment, we are compelled to use best informationavailable in our final results in light of the remaining deficiencies (<T3>see </T3>Memorandum to the file dated February 10, 1989). Given theclarifications and explanations furnished by NAR, however, we have decidedto base best information available, in part, on data NAR provided in itsJuly 6, 1988 submission, such as the materials and labor components. Becausewe are forced to proceed on a best information available basis, we havestill applied the adverse inference rule in determining which of NAR'sdata we used. For example, as best information available we added to FMVthe differential between the highest cost for each component of materialsand labor for U.S. tape and the lowest cost of each component for homemarket tape, for all sizes of tape for which NAR provided cost data. Fordirect factory overhead, as best information available we used the highestcost differential from another company in a previous review.<T3>Comment 8</T3>: NAR contends that the Department should not have usedthe Federal Reserve Board quarterly exchange rates in its calculations,but should have used the exchange rates which NAR submitted.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: Using the Federal Reserve Board rates ofexchange is in accordance with section 353.56(a) of the Commerce Regulations.Recently the CIT upheld this position in <T3>NAR </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>slip. op. 89-12 (Ct. Int'l Trade, January 27, 1989).<T3>Comment 9</T3>: NAR contends that the Department should have used aweighted-average U.S. price, rather than individual U.S. prices, sinceCongress intended section 777A of the Tariff Act to provide for a fairercomparison between U.S. price and FMV. NAR claims that weight-averagingU.S. prices would produce fairer results because NAR would be creditedfor U.S. sales made at or above its FMV and Commerce would be less likelyto find sales at margin. Finally, NAR argues that the Department shoulduse average U.S. movement expenses, rather than sale-by-sale movement expenses.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We disagree. Congress added this sectionof the Tariff Act allowing sampling and averaging of U.S. sales data toreduce Departmental costs and the administrative burden where a signficiantvolume of sales is involved or a significant number of adjustments to pricesis required. Congress did not intend to discourage the Department fromusing individual sales data when available and when doing so is administrativelyfeasible. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 725, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1984). With respectto U.S. movement expenses, we prefer to adjust for these expenses on asale-by-sale basis when, as here, such data are available, since this moreaccurately reflects the actual expenses incurred.<T3>Comment 10</T3>: NAR argues that the Department should not have offsethome market commissions with U.S. indirect selling expenses because section353.15(c) of the Commerce Regulations is applicable only in exporter'ssales price calculations.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We disagree. Only the last sentence ofsection 353.15(c) is restricted to exporter's sales price situations. Therest of this section is applicable in both purchase price and exporter'ssales price situations. Recently, the CIT upheld our application of section353.15(c) to purchase price situations in <T3>NAR </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 89-12 (Ct. Int'l Trade, January 27, 1989).<T3>Comment 11: </T3>NAR argues that the Department incorrectly assumedthat U.S. indirect selling expenses equalled or exceeded the full amountof the commissions paid in the home market. NAR also contends that theDepartment overstated the amount of U.S. indirect selling expenses becausesalaries for salesmen who service the U.S. market should be treated asdirect selling expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We did not assume that U.S.indirect selling expenses equalled or exceeded home market commission.In cases where U.S. indirect selling expenses were greater than home marketcommissions, we limited our adjustment for U.S. indirect selling expensesby the amount of the home market commissions. We consider salemen's salariesto be indirect, rather than direct, selling expenses, since they are paidwhether or not specific sales are made. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of the comments received, we have revised our preliminary resultsfor NAR and we determine that the following margins exist: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,25,20</C>  <H1>Manufacturer/Exporter </H1><H1>Time period </H1><H1>Margin (percent) </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">NAR <D>10/01/86-9/30/87 </D><D>1.40 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Manuli <D>10/01/86-9/30/87 </D><D>\1\ 0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Irplastnastri <D>10/01/86-9/30/87 </D><D>\1\ 12.66 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Boston <D>10/01/86-9/30/87 </D><D>\1\ 8.67 </D></ITAG>\1\ No shipments during the period; margin from last review in which therewere shipments. </ITAG> The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisementinstructions directly to the Customs Service. As provided for in section751(a) of the Tariff Act, a cash deposit of estimated antidumping dutiesbased on the above margins shall be required for these firms. For any shipments from the remaining known manufacturers and/or exportersnot covered by this review, the cash deposit will continue to be at therate published in the final results of the last administrative review foreach of those firms (48 FR 35688, August 5, 1983, 51 FR 43955, December5, 1986, and 53 FR 16444, May 9, 1988). For any shipments from a new exporter not covered in this or prior administrativereviews, whose first shipments of Italian pressure sensitive plastic tapeoccurred after September 30, 1987, and who is unrelated to any reviewedfirm or any previously reviewed firm, a cash deposit of 1.40 percent shallbe required. These deposit requirements are effective for all shipmentsof Italian pressure sensitive plastic tape entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice andshall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the nextadministrative review.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.53a. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
