RUSSO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Enter any bookstore and you'll find walls ofself-help manuals. They'll save your marriage, cure your phobia,release the ``inner you,'' or enable you to stick to the only dietyou'll ever need.   Many of them make claims on the covers or jackets that thecontents don't deliver, and some use theories that have not beenproved, said psychologist Gerald Rosen, who wants his fellowprofessionals to do something about that.   He suggests a kind of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval fromthe American Psychological Association. Books would be required tostate how methods had been tested, on whom, and how effective theywere. And now the market includes cassette tapes, too.   ``We have to have these products marketed with accurate claimsand not take advantage of the public,'' said Rosen, who is inprivate practice in Seattle and has written a self-help book of hisown, about phobias.   Rosen had hoped to present a ``Golden Fleece Award'' forself-help psychotherapies at the APA's convention last August inNew Orleans to embarrass therapists who made exaggerated claimsabout untested programs. He had planned to pass out noisemakers,and make awards based on the level of honks and boos each bookreceived.   But the APA nixed the idea.   ``Very bad taste,'' said Charles Spielberger, APA president.``It's not scientific evaluation, people booing.''   If an APA member writes a book that violates the organization'sethical principles and if someone files a claim, the APA wouldinvestigate, said Spielberger, a psychology professor at theUniversity of South Florida, Tampa.   ``We don't shrink for a minute from expelling or censuring amember who doesn't follow APA code,'' said Raymond Fowler, apsychologist and APA chief executive officer, but ``you can't justlet one member speak for the association and say, `Here's a bad guydoing a bad job.'''   But APA may consider regulating member authors.   ``We will start a serious consideration of APA's role in lookingat self-help books and ... (whether) we need to develop a taskforce to draw up guidelines or inform our members of generalstandards,'' Fowler said recently.   ``The truth is, I wouldn't want to underestimate some of thesebooks. They are very sound and very sensitively thought out,'' saidFowler, ``and for some individuals it may be the only psychologicalhelp they'll obtain.''   And evaluating every self-help book would be an enormousundertaking.   Rosen's book, ``Don't Be Afraid,'' had its share of exaggeratedclaims, he said, and the experience taught him it would be possiblefor the APA to set up a standard contract for psychologists tonegotiate control of book promotion.   One way to deal with book jacket hyperbole, Rosen said, is forauthors to take a tough stand with publishers. But Herbert Holtje,a literary agent, said it is nearly impossible for writers tomaintain that kind of control.   It is unrealistic that self-help books ``should be marketedwithout consideration of the competitive climate created bypublishers,'' Holtje wrote in the journal American Psychologist.   Albert Ellis, president of the Institute for Rational-EmotiveTherapy and a psychologist in New York City, has written more than50 self-help books.   ``I'm critical of some self-help books but definitely in favorof others,'' said Ellis, who would approve of a program to test abook for effectiveness. But he said he doubts publishers would waitaround for that.   ``I must say there's something frustrating about the hard workof research day in and day out just to get a little way and someonereels out a pot-boiler and makes thousands,'' said PatriciaKeith-Spiegel, a professor of psychology at California StateUniversity at Northridge who teaches a course in ethics.   She was on the APA's ethics committee at a time when apsychologist couldn't give out professional advice except in aclient-patient relationship.   ``Then everything exploded,'' she said, and psychologists wereon radio and television, they were writing columns, they werewriting books.   She is writing her own how-to book, how to get into graduateschool.   ``I've been a vocal critic of self-help books,'' Keith-Spiegelsaid. ``I'm going to have to research and check out everything Isay.''   Rosen cites a number of books he feels exaggerate their claims.One is ``The Doctors Guide to Instant Stress Relief: APsychological and Medical System,'' by psychologists Ronald G.Nathan and Thomas E. Staats, and Dr. Paul J. Rosch.   ``I don't believe there's any such thing as instant stressrelief,'' Rosen said. ``It could have been called the `DoctorsGuide to Stress Relief You Can Learn in a Few Weeks.'''   But Nathan said the title was suggested by the publisher andagreed upon only after much discussion among the authors. While itmay take six months to learn the technique of instant relaxation,it then can be applied in seconds, he said.   One danger in self-help books is that people can misdiagnosethemselves and fail to seek help, Rosen contends. But Nathan saidhe and his co-authors provided a test for the reader to determineif professional help is needed.   ``My pitch has been trying to convince psychology professionalsthat it's time to take self-help books seriously because they'veset up an alternate therapy system, and the books reach many moreconsumers than we will,'' said Steven Starker, chief ofpsychological services and professor of medical psychology atOregon Health Sciences University in Portland, Ore.   He also made that point in an article debating the topic in themagazine American Psychologist.   ``I have talked to a lot of people over the years who have founda great deal of help in self-help books,'' said Bernie Zilbergeld,a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, Calif., andco-author of ``Mind Power: Getting What You Want Through MentalTraining.''   ``If they can go out and pay $5 for a paperback book and gethelp from it without seeing me, why not?'' Zilbergeld said.   Rosen admits he sounds self-serving: He charges $95 for an hourof therapy. But, he said, professionals should not promise thepublic more than they can deliver.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for April 16</NOTE></DOC>
