The work stoppage could occur as early as 12:01 a.m. April17, they say, after a 60-day cooling off period expires.Negotiations between railroads and some unions appear to bestalled over a presidential board's recommendations forchanges in work rules, wages and health and welfare issuesthat rail executives believe will make the industry morecompetitive with trucks. But some rail labor leaders view theproposed changes as a major setback that could sharply erodeunion ranks.</LP><TEXT>   Railroads currently haul about 26% of the nation'sintercity freight tonnage, with a particularly important rolein the transport of coal, grain, chemicals, steel, forestproducts and automobiles. Despite pledges by rail unions notto target passenger services, a strike could extensivelydisrupt travel in cases where commuter and intercitypassenger trains operate over rails owned by freightrailroads.   &quot;I predict there will be a strike,&quot; said Fred A. Hardin,international president of the United Transportation Union,who calls the board's proposals &quot;just unreasonable and justtoo damaging.&quot;   The railroad industry is preparing management personnel tooperate trains and planning to set up a strike command centerin Washington. And some railroads are noting slightly highertraffic levels this week as shippers seek to move freight inadvance of a strike.   To be sure, negotiations are continuing with several ofthe 11 rail crafts. Last week the TransportationCommunications Union reached a tentative accord on someissues. However, agreements with the UTU and the Brotherhoodof Locomotive Engineers were considered unlikely before thedeadline.   Rail unions aren't disclosing their strategy, which couldrange from calling a nationwide strike, selectively targetingone or two railroads or calling a rolling strike, hittingdifferent railroads at different times. Rail officials sayprivately that they hope the unions go for a nationwidestrike that would create the type of crisis most likely tocompel Congress to quickly order rail workers back to theirjobs and adopt the presidential board's recommendations withthe fewest changes.   Shippers say they would expect major disruptions if a railstrike lasted more than a couple of days. At that time, &quot;westart to choke on finished vehicles, the majority of whichare shipped by rail,&quot; said Charles Wilkins, director oftransportation and traffic at Ford Motor Co. &quot;Usually, aftertwo or three days, it's hard to keep the average assemblyplant running.&quot;   In its report issued last January, the three-memberpresidential emergency board took on an unusually wide arrayof bargaining issues. It generally found a middle course,proposing wage increases short of those sought by labor andignoring industry requests for wage reductions. The boardrecommended that part of the industry's mounting health-costburden be shared by employees. And it suggested importantchanges in some of the labor restrictions that have shackledrail management for decades and rendered the industry lessable to compete with trucks for lucrative merchandisefreight.   For example, the board recommended that the mileage thattrain crews must travel for a day's pay be increased to 130miles by 1995 from the current 108 miles. The rail industryhad sought to change the standard to 160 miles. A truckdriver typically covers more than 600 miles in a day.   The board acknowledged that the issue of train staffingshould be handled at the local level, but then recommended aprocedure of binding arbitration to cut the size of thecrews. Most freight trains still have three or four crewmembers aboard, which is more than the two or three thatrailroads think are necessary.   Another recommendation would allow crews aboardover-the-road trains to handle cars for industries nearfreight yards. Now, a separate yard crew must do the work,leading to delays and higher costs for shippers.   For example, labor restrictions that would be modified bythe board's report now add three days to the transit time onCSX Corp. of freight cars bound to a St. Joe Paper Co. plantin Baltimore from North Carolina. Bob Cart, CSX's Baltimoredivision manager, said that if over-the-road crews coulddeliver the cars directly to the customer, the transit timewould be only two days, rather than five. Under current laboragreements, the cars are transferred three times betweenyards within Baltimore so that different crews can performdifferent tasks reserved to them by the union contract.   Rail executives are playing down the benefits of suchproposals. &quot;They are a step forward, but not a savior for theindustry,&quot; said Michael Walsh, chairman of Union PacificCorp.'s rail unit.   But labor leaders believe the recommendations clearlyfavor rail management. &quot;They won't admit that, but they can'twait for these recommendations as they are,&quot; said Larry D.McFather, president of the Brotherhood of LocomotiveEngineers. Mr. Hardin, the president of the UTU, said thetype of reductions in train crew sizes that the railroadswould like could potentially cut UTU members at the freightrailroads by 18,000, or 25%. He plans to lobby Congress thisweek to disregard the board's findings and appoint a newcommission to review the issues.   There is also a lot at stake for shippers, who blameinefficient work practices on the rails for their decision toswitch more freight to trucks. &quot;We have been going to trucksfor the last 30 years,&quot; said John J. Archer, vice president,logistics, at Ashland Oil Co.'s chemical subsidiary.&quot;Railroads just can't do the things we need done because oftheir embedded work rules.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
