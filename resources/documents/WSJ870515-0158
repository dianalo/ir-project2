The maker of high-pressure laminated products filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of six million common shares. The company plans to sell 4.5 million shares and institutional investors will sell the other 1.5 million.    Investors, including management, paid about $15 million for equity in the company in a buyout from American Cyanamid Co. in May 1985. After the offering, the company will have 12 million shares outstanding. The estimated offering price is $14 to $16 a share.    Funds will be used to pay down 16 1/2% long-term debt and to redeem $20 million of preferred stock held by Cyanamid. Debt will be reduced to about $135 million from $165 million when the company was purchased.    Gordon D. Sterling, chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;Investment bankers have told us the market is receptive to initial public offerings at this time, and we've done well since we separated from American Cyanamid.&quot; He said as much as 25% of the offering might be made overseas.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which was part of the buyout group, will be the lead underwriter for the offering.    The company doesn't expect to pay a dividend on the common shares anytime soon. In 1986, Formica earned more than $9 million on sales of $378 million. </TEXT></DOC>
