SullivanandM;While an ever-increasing number of companies are formalizing theirsoftware-development techniques through the use of computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) tools, for many the transition equates to culture shock.andM;For programmers and management, adopting CASE often requires rethinking theway software is created.andP;  In effect, the thought processes of softwaredevelopers must be re-engineered.andM;Both management and programmers must carefully assess what kinds of resultsthey can realistically expect to achieve with CASE technology.andM;The difficulties in adopting CASE tools have turned what was once expected tobe a $1 billion business by 1990 into an industry that is more likely toreach only $100 million by then, according to several vendors and analysts.andM;One reason for the bleak outlook is that user expectations about CASE toolsare muddled, according to Tom Scott, director of market development forProMod Inc. in El Toro, Calif., maker of the ProMod line of CASE software.andM;There is confusion over what CASE tools can and cannot do, partly because&quot;anybody with a product remotely related to CASE calls it a CASE tool,&quot; Scottsaid.andM;Indeed, the definition of CASE varies from vendor to vendor.andM;&quot;It's fashionable to call yourself CASE,&quot; said Sherman Drusin, president ofComputer Systems Advisers Inc. in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., which makes modularpicture-oriented CASE tools.andP;  &quot;Sorting out everything that's made availablewith a CASE label on it is a problem for the prospective user.&quot;andM;According to Scott, &quot;The hype surrounding CASE has resulted in theexpectation that it's some sort of magic wand for solving problems.andP;  Afterthe product's first usage, users may find that, in fact, it did not solve theproblem.&quot;andM;In such cases, the tool may wind up collecting dust on a shelf.andM;Long-Term BenefitsandM;Such misunderstandings of the benefits of CASE have kept many users fromrecognizing the long-term advantages.andM;&quot;Improved productivity is not the immediate benefit of CASE,&quot; said GregBoone, president of CASE Research Corp., a market-research and consultingfirm in Bellevue, Wash.andP;  Instead, the &quot;primary benefit is improved quality ofthe application,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;Most people in the data-processing profession are expecting a magic pill,&quot;said Boone.andM;&quot;CASE is not going to save them, because the nature of the problem haschanged,&quot; Boone continued.andP;  &quot;Now we have to develop larger and more complexapplications in less time, and we have to bring more engineering disciplineand rigor to the process.&quot;andM;To build today's complex business systems, Boone said, users will finallyhave to recognize that &quot;they can't be hackers anymore.&quot;andM;This CASE philosophy requires that a cultural change take place amongsoftware programmers.andP;  Opposition to such a change is the strongest forceworking against full CASE implementation, according to all sides.andM;&quot;Traditionally, automation has translated to displacing people,&quot; noted DonSherwood, vice president of sales and marketing at Bachman InformationSystems Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., maker of the Bachman/Re-Engineering ProductSet, a series of CASE tools.andM;What people often don't realize, he said, is that users are a vital elementin automating software analysis.andM;Converting hackers to a formal approach in software design is not an easytask, said Bob Seltzer, executive vice president of Meta Software Corp. inCambridge, Mass., maker of Design/OA, a CASE development tool.andM;&quot;Most people who build software systems do not use Yourdan [CASEmethodologies] or any other formal techniques.andP;  They use techniques that arehomegrown,&quot; Seltzer said.andM;In addition, the mind-set of programmers must change before CASE tools can beused effectively, according to Paul Paetz, director of marketing for NetronInc. in Toronto, maker of the Netron/CAP CASE product.andM;&quot;There is a strong opinion among data-processing staffs that programming isan art, that we can't build software better or cleaner, and we can't automateit,&quot; Paetz said.andM;To begin a cultural change, cooperation between the programming staff andmanagement is essential.andM;Paul Radding, president of Technology Decisions Inc., a Birmingham, Mich.,andO;consulting firm that specializes in CASE, advises companies to &quot;create aprogram that both management and staff perceive is one they helped to puttogether.&quot;andM;At Unim Corp., for example, resistance to change was reversed throughtraining by the vendor and the establishment of a single corporate goal, saidTim Pinette, a systems consultant at the Portland, Maine, insurance firm.andM;At first, &quot;a lot of people were skeptical, and some were pushing back andsaying that they didn't want to use CASE tools,&quot; Pinette said.andM;The first step in Unim's plan sent all potential users to a training courseon the Bachman/Re-Engineering Product Set.andP;  &quot;The captive audience saw thewhole thing from front to back.andP;  Once everyone knew the internal objective,it became obvious that those tools had a place here and that they weren'tthreatening anyone,&quot; said Pinette.andM;But the programmers who will use the CASE tools aren't the only ones needingan education on CASE methods and benefits.andP;  Management sometimes stands inthe way of CASE purchases, according to users.andM;&quot;The problem with using CASE is the same as with using computers -- thecorporate society becomes split,&quot; said Jim Stewart, a user of PC-SystemsInc.'s Model S and administrator of planning and scheduling at GeneralElectric Corp.'s radar manufacturing plant in Morristown, N.J.andM;&quot;Upper-level management is not computer-literate, and they fear [CASE] like aforeign technology that's out of their league,&quot; Stewart said.andM;Management's hesitation to invest in CASE tools and training can be anotherbarrier, asserted Paul Germain, a user of Popkin Software Inc.'s SystemArchitect CASE tool and a systems engineer with General Electric Aerospace inCamden, N.J.andP;  &quot;Once you start giving management costs instead of justlong-term benefits, they tend to focus on the costs,&quot; Germain said.andM;The costs associated with CASE tools and training can be astronomical,according to users.andM;&quot;If you spend $5,000 for a CASE tool, you're going to have to spend threetimes that on education,&quot; said ProMod's Scott.andM;Said Sherwood of Bachman Information Systems, &quot;Data-processing organizationshave historically justified applications with hard-dollar justifications.&quot;andO;The &quot;soft-dollar&quot; benefits of improved quality are more difficult to measure,he said.andM;Users, analysts and vendors agree that an entire organization must be willingto adopt CASE if a companywide transition is to be successful.andM;Kevin Van Noppen, a user of Syscorp International's MicroSTEP CASE tool and asenior manager in the Advanced Technology division of the accounting firmKMPG Peat Marwick Main in Chicago, summed it up neatly: &quot;With any CASEproduct, corporate commitment is the most significant issue.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
