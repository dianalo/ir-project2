The rebatechecks will average $165, the company said.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AUTO INSURANCE FIRM REBATES $80 MILLION  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;We just want to pay the rebate and get on with this, and, furthermore,move on with more insurance reforms,&quot; said Thomas V. McKernan, president andchief executive of the Automobile Club of Southern California.;   Thecompany's move followed state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's orderslast week for rebates totaling $1.56 billion from 14 companies, including theauto club.;   Some of the insurers have indicated they will fight Garamendi'sdirective.;   &quot;I'm delighted to stand here today and say with a completelystraight face that the checks are in the mail,&quot; Garamendi said at a newsconference at the club's headquarters.;   &quot;The auto club's action deservesgreat praise,&quot; Garamendi said. &quot;Their courageous decision clearly separatesthem from the rest of the industry and shows their good faith with theirmembers and customers.&quot;;   The California State Automobile Association, basedin San Francisco, has said it's considering appealing its estimated $157million rate rollback announced by Garamendi.;   And State Farm Insurance Co.,which received a $234.6 million rollback order last week, has criticizedGaramendi's formula for calculating Proposition 103 rebates.;   Lisa Ormond, aCalifornia spokeswoman for the company, said State Farm lost money on itsCalifornia operations in 1989, the year to which the rebates apply, and cannotafford to pay the rebate.;   Garamendi's formula appears to show the insurerwith a return of nearly 18 percent in California that year, a figure Ormondcharacterized as &quot;fantasy.&quot;;   State Farm plans to challenge the calculationsin its administrative hearing with the Insurance Department, Ormond said. Thehearing is tentatively scheduled for mid-1992, she said.;   Under itsagreement with regulators, the auto club was credited with $24 million it paidin dividends to its 1989 policyholders, making the total rebate worth morethan $104 million.;   The auto club's announcement sparked celebration at theoffices of Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of the group Voter Revolt and co-authorof Proposition 103.;   &quot;We all said we wouldn't really celebrate until moneywent back into people's pockets -- and now that has happened,&quot; Rosenfieldsaid. &quot;Today, every consumer can celebrate this triumph.&quot;;   Rosenfield urgedconsumers to keep the heat on their insurance companies to comply withGaramendi's directive.;   Proposition 103, approved by voters in 1988,required all property-casualty rates to be cut 20 percent below November 1987levels. The courts ruled, however, that insurers are entitled to a fairprofit.;   That ruling has triggered a bitter debate between insurers andconsumer interests over the definition of a fair profit.;   The rollbacksapplied to more than auto insurance, but public attention focused on vehiclecoverage. California has more than 20 million drivers and the third-highestauto insurance rates in the country.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911024  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  539  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 24, 199100298111,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
