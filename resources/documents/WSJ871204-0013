Judge Greene, who oversees the accord that broke up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., accused FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick of &quot;exhorting&quot; the regional Bell companies to disobey his orders, and warned the agency against trying to challenge the court's jurisdiction.    &quot;There should be no doubt that this court will carry out its constitutional and statutory responsibility to protect the decree against violation,&quot; Judge Greene said in an opinion in which he compared himself to federal judges who have withstood opposition to their orders to desegregate schools in the South.    He accused the Justice Department of failing to carry out its enforcement role under the 1984 ATandamp;T consent decree for at least the past two years. During that time, he said, the department failed to investigate allegations that the Bell companies were violating the decree's prohibition against manufacturing and didn't tell the judge of the complaints. As a result, he said, Baby Bell competitors &quot;may have been unnecessarily injured.&quot;    Judge Greene's criticisms were part of a ruling in favor of ATandamp;T. ATandamp;T in June had asked the judge to restrict the Bell companies from designing and developing telecommunications products, as well as fabricating them. The consent decree had banned the Bell companies from manufacturing, but it hasn't been clear whether that also included design work. ATandamp;T wanted to make sure a Bell company couldn't design such products and then simply have them produced elsewhere. Judge Greene granted ATandamp;T's request and used the occasion to rebuke the FCC and the Justice Department.    Judge Greene's decision was a setback for the regional Bells and would appear to jeopardize some ventures that they already have under way. At an analysts meeting in Philadelphia, Bell Atlantic vowed to appeal, and other companies are considering similar action.    Despite its victory, ATandamp;T said only that Judge Greene's interpretation &quot;should benefit the telecommunications industry by resolving&quot; the controversy over what constitutes manufacturing.    Judge Greene was especially angered by an October speech by Mr. Patrick, in which the FCC chairman said he was &quot;quite frankly, surprised by the apparent acquiescence&quot; of some of the Baby Bells to the decree. Judge Greene said that remark amounted to &quot;incitement to noncompliance.&quot;    But Mr. Patrick, in a statement yesterday, said the judge &quot;seriously misconstrued&quot; his intent. &quot;I didn't say that the Bell companies should disobey&quot; the decree, Mr. Patrick said. &quot;Briefs, appeals and legislative remedies are obviously what I had in mind.&quot;    The sharp exchanges heighten the bitter dispute between the Reagan administration and Judge Greene over the direction of telecommunications policy. Last week, a Commerce Department telecommunications agency asked the FCC to order the Baby Bells to provide information services, setting the stage for a confrontation between Judge Greene and the FCC. The Bell companies are largely banned from information services under the consent decree the judge oversees.    The FCC hasn't yet taken any action on the petition by the Commerce Department agency, but Judge Greene appeared yesterday to be warning the agency against provoking a conflict. Bruce Fein, a former FCC general counsel, said the judge's ruling could have the opposite effect, however, by pushing the FCC and Justice Department to defend their turf. &quot;It's almost like Judge Greene is citing them for contempt,&quot; he said.    In September, Judge Greene loosened somewhat the restriction on information services by allowing the Bell companies to &quot;transport&quot; information, although he didn't fully define that term. He is expected to spell out the concept early next year.    In his ruling, Judge Greene said the Justice Department hadn't pursued allegations that the Bell companies were violating the ban on manufacturing because department officials believed he might lift the ban in his September ruling. The judge rejected the approach, and said he hopes the Justice Department will begin enforcing the decree more stringently.    The Justice Department hasn't yet decided whether to join in any appeal of the ruling, and department officials wouldn't comment on the judge's remarks.    Most of the regional Bells said they have yet to consider the immediate impact of the ruling on their businesses, but it already appears to have placed a cloud over some existing ventures.    For example, Chicago-based Ameritech, with Justice Department approval, has financed research and development work that Sunnyvale, Calif.-based David Systems Corp. is performing on a local area network project. David, a design and development concern, would in turn subcontract manufacturing of the product. Ameritech, however, said it wants to receive a licensing fee from sales of the product to recover its investment -- something the ruling would appear to jeopardize.    The ruling may have a more direct impact, however, on U S West Inc. and Nynex Corp., which have been greatly expanding their reseach and development capabilities. About 18 months ago, Nynex Corp. established a Department of Science and Technology to provide additional assistance for its various units. U S West decided in October to build a research and development center in Colorado, which is valued at as much as $50 million and would eventually employ as many as 1,500 people.    ---   Johnnie L.
