additional productsscheduled to be transferred before the end of October 1990 include the EXOS205 series for personal computer-bus systems, and the EXOS 215 series forMicro Channel architecture.andM;- o -andM;The Pandamp;P Distribution arm of fast-growing Pandamp;P Plc, Rossendale, Lancashire, hasset up an open systems division to begin distributing Informix Software Inc'soffice automation and database applications.andM;- o -andM;The peripherals divisions of Trinitec Plc and Rapid Recall Ltd - both ownedby the Paris-based Metrologie International SA group - are to be combined ina new division called Trinitec Winners, based at Trinitec's North-West Londonoffices.andM;- o -andM;And London-based Amarante - the Unix products distribution division ofTrinitec Plc - is to begin selling Network Computing Devices' recentlyintroduced low-cost NCD19b X-terminal in the UK, at #1,960.andM;- o -andM;Tandem Computers' NonStop CLX midrange systems have been selected by HermansGroep of Soest in Holland to automate its retailing operations: the Dutchcompany employs over 4,000 staff and has an annual turnover of $475m; themerchandising application comes from DacosSoftware GmbH, and it will use theNonStop SQL relational database management system; Dacos Software, which isbased in St Ingbert, West Germany, is supplying Dispos software with stockmonitoring, ordering, and supply modules in addition to the managementinformation system and accounting interfaces.andM;- o -andM;Computer Products Plus Inc, a Huntington Beach, California-based supplier ofportable laptop computer peripherals and accessories, has a new WsP-200printer claimed to be the smallest form factor and lightest battery-operatedprinter available: it prints both text and graphics with 24-pin Epsoncompatibility and resolution on full-width pages, and the thermal print headprints on standard fax paper so that ink cartridges or ribbons areunnecessary; the Wsp-200 is 1.12&quot; by 6.75&quot; by 11.5&quot;, and weighs 3.5 lbsincluding batteries; it runs on AC power with a recharging adapter, or for 45minutes on a rechargeable and removable NiCad battery pack; available fromthis month, the WsP-200 sells for $350.andM;- o -andM;Ingres Corp says that the latest version of its Ingres relational databasemanagement system, including the new Knowledge and Object Manager extensions,is now available on the Sun Microsystems Sparcstation range of workstations:Object Manager is designed to enable access to non-standard data structuresthrough SQL, Knowledge Manager enables predetermined rules to be associatedwith particular data types.andM;- o -andM;Island Graphics Corp, headquartered in San Rafael, California is shippingHewlett-Packard and Apollo versions of its Unix-based desktop publishingsoftware via the Apollo Direct Channel and the Hewlett-Packard sales force:claimed to be the first publishing products available with the OSF/Motifgraphical user interface, they are sold as the Island Productivity Seriesversion 2.0, and run on the Apollo personal workstation series, the HP 9000Series 300 line of workstations, and the new HP Series 400 stations;IslandWrite offers what-you-see-is-what-you-get word processing with desktoppublishing;

the divestiture represents something of a failureon IBM's behalf, because although typewriters are a very mature market, thereis likely to be steady demand for keyboards and low-end printers for manyyears to come, and IBM is saying it can't compete sucessfully with the FarEastern manufacturers - will it decide in time that the same is true ofpersonal computers?andM;- o -andM;IBM has keyboard, printer and typewriter operations attached to theLexington, Kentucky unit that is being divested scattered across Europe, withfacories in Jfalla, Sweden; Greenock, Scotland; Vimercate, Italy; and aco-ordinating base in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.andM;- o -andM;The US Justice Department has bowled Judge Greene a googly by recommendingthat he should approve the application by two of the Baby Bells, Ameritechand Bell Atlantic Corp, to be allowed to offer long-distance service betweenNew Zealand and the US, including ownership of satellites and undersea cablesfor the service, following their acquisition of Telecom Corp of New Zealandfor $2,460m: all the activities at issue are barred to the Baby Bells underthe ATandamp;T break-up consent decree, and last time the issue arose, when NynexCorp asked to be allowed to hold the US end of the PTAT-1 transatlantic fibreoptic cable, Judge Greene said no way.andM;- o -andM;Newly-formed Compaq Computer Hong Kong Ltd is the Houston micromaker's 18thinternational subsidiary.andM;- o -andM;At the 11th hour, Japan has reached agreement with US negotiators that itwill liberalise its telecommunications market so that US companies cancompete both in offering termination equipment without the need to go throughNippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp, and introducing value-added networkservices such as electronic data interchange, voicemail, electronic mail andelectronic banking services with very little regulation: observers reckon theopening up could bring US firms $150m of business a year.andM;- o -andM;The Deutsche Bundespost has clung tenaciously to its monopoly against allodds, but suddenly a greater benefit beckons, and it has moved to suspend itsmonopoly in order to speed up the process of giving East Germany a phonesystem that works - but the Luddite postal trade union is consideringchallenging the move in the courts: under the move, companies will be free touse satellite links to communicate by voice and data with East Germansubsidiaries, and can offer capacity on the networks to third parties - butthe Bundespost hasn't gone mad, and intends to reassert its monopoly on voicetraffic in 1994.andM;- o -andM;While Germany is preoccupied on its doorstep, Italy has made a pre-emptivestrike to become the dominant economic power to the south, rounding upAustria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Jugoslavia into a co-operative zone thatinter alia would look to establish a regional telecommunications system withfibre optics and their own satellites.andM;- o -andM;Compaq Computer Corp has sliced $300 off the price of its LTE laptop computerin the US, bringing the price down to $2,000: LTE/286 models are cut between$500 and $800, with the top model now $4,000 for cuts ranging from 13% to17%.andM;- o -andM;Harris Corp is still struggling to get its semiconductor business, bloated byacquisitions, into shape and is laying off 250 more staff.andM;- o -andM;The Appeal Court has ruled that while a company is in administrati-on, ownersof equipment supplied under hire purchase and leasing agreements don't havean unreserved entitlement to periodic payments due under the terms of theagreements; it is also at the discretion of the court whether payments areexpenses of the administration - which means they are payable before theclaims of unsecured creditors - or whether owners are given leave torepossess the equipment; all of which means that Norwich Union and AlliedIrish Bank don't have the absolute right to be paid rents as part of AtlanticComputers administrators' expenses, but given the court's permission, theymay repossess their equipment; the ruling overturns the High Court decisionhanded down in June (CI No 1,448).andM;- o -andM;We're all for enterprise and initiative, but isn't it a little inappropriatefor these bodies like the British Railways Board, which seem to be able tosatisfy none of their passengers any of the time, should be diverting so muchof their clearly all-too-thinly-spread management expertise to studying plansto enter the telecommunications market - and now London Underground is at it:according to the Financial Times, it is dreaming of investing #30m to #70m tolay fibre optic cables through its tunnels to create a Metropolitan-widetelecommunications network that could be marketed commercially as well asimproving its signalling system.andM;- o -andM;The US Federal Communications Commission approved MCI Communications Corp's$1,200m Telecom*USA Inc buy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
