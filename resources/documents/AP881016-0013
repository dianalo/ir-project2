Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, says theadvertisements are an ``outrageous distortion'' of his positions.His campaign has asked the gun lobby to pull them, and iscounter-attacking with its own radio and TV ads.   Daniel A. Taylor, general counsel for the Dukakis campaign, toldthe NRA by letter that it was wrongly attributing statements toDukakis and ignoring an issues questionnaire the governor hadfilled out, according to campaign spokeswoman Lorraine Voles.   But Wayne La Pierre, director of the NRA's lobbying arm, saidthe ads were factual. He accused the Dukakis campaign of ``aheavy-handed attempt to keep us from relaying the truth.''   The NRA started running the radio spots a week ago in Texas,California, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Arkansasand Montana, among other states.   ``We're covering those states from one end to the other _probably thousands of stations,'' said La Pierre. He declined tosay how much the NRA had spent on the radio ads or on a companiondirect-mail campaign.   La Pierre said ``there is tremendous support for gun ownershipand hunting'' in the target states. ``Dukakis' strident position asgovernor ... could very well cost him those states. He's making alast-ditch, desperate attempt to say he's really pro-sportsmen andpro-firearms ownership,'' he said.   Dukakis tried to defuse the NRA ads last weekend before theybegan, calling them ``another outrageous distortion of what Ibelieve.''   His campaign is counter-attacking with its own radio ads and, inTexas, with two television ads on the crime and gun control recordsof Republican nominee George Bush.   The NRA, operating independently of the Bush campaign, isrunning three 60-second radio spots. One quotes Dukakis as sayinghe was ``going to do everything I can to disarm this state.'' TheNRA narrator says, ``Don't let this up-North nonsense gonationwide.''   Another NRA spot features actor Charlton Heston, who saysDukakis ``opposed mandatory jail time for drug pushers, vetoed thedeath penalty for cop killers, gave murderers weekend vacationsfrom prison. He also did everything he could to take guns away fromhonest citizens. ... Michael Dukakis is not just challenging yourrights. He's taking on the Constitution.''   Another ad is aimed at Pennsylvanians. A ``sportsman'' says heloves the Pennsylvania woods and accuses Dukakis of raiding hisstate's conservation fund to pay off state debt. ``Protect ouroutdoor heritage. Defeat Dukakis,'' an announcer concludes.   In his letter, Taylor said Dukakis has denied ever saying he wasgoing to try to disarm his state. He also said Dukakis hadcompleted a questionnaire for the NRA in which he said he supportedfirearm ownership for personal protection, hunting, competitiveshooting, informal sport shooting and collecting.   ``He did support a ban on `Saturday night specials','' Taylorsaid.   One of the Dukakis TV spots running in Texas says only onecandidate for president has voted for federal gun control _ GeorgeBush. The ad cites a Bush vote as a congressman and adds, ``MikeDukakis supports gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen. Don't beconfused.''   Dukakis' other Texas TV ad says ``George Bush sat by while afederal furlough program released thousands of prisoners, many ofthem drug dealers _ almost 14,000 in 1987 alone. And now suddenlyGeorge Bush is attacking Michael Dukakis for just one case in hisfurlough program. But Michael Dukakis took action and changed thatprogram, in his state he's reduced crime by 13 percent and themurder rate is the lowest of any major industrial state.''</TEXT></DOC>
