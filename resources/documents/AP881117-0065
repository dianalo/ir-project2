Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin dismissed the declaration of aPalestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories as a ``PLOdeception attempt,'' and Israel launched a diplomatic offensive onWednesday to counter it.   Hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were shot and woundedwhen soldiers opened fire on rioting youths near Nablus in the WestBank and several areas of the Gaza Strip. Among the wounded were a15-year-old girl shot in the back and a 34-year-old woman hit in theleft thigh, they said.   The army said it was checking the reports.   In Arab east Jersualem today, two Israeli policemen were injuredby rocks at an Arab boys' school, police spokesman Rafi Levy said.He said riot police then entered Rashadiye School and arrested eightstudents.   A teacher said trouble started when police arrived to quietstudents singing Palestinian patriotic songs in the school'scourtyard. The teacher would not give his name.   The army lifted curfews from several towns in the Gaza Strip,home to 650,000 Palestinians, but kept curfews in effect for the250,000 who live in refugee camps. A curfew also was maintained onthe Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarem in the West Bank.   Telephone lines remained cut off to homes and businesses for aseventh day in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah andJenin, but the army said they would be restored during the day.   The lines were severed to prevent Palestinians from coordinatinganti-Israeli activities during the meeting in Algiers of the PLO'sparliament-in-exile, which ended Tuesday with the declaration ofindependence.   The government, meanwhile, confirmed that Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin ordered Israel Television not to show scenes ofjubilation at the Palestine National Council meeting in order not toincite Palestinians in the territories.   Rabin, who has been defense minister in charge of quellingviolence during the 11-month Palestinian uprising, told Israeltelevision Wednesday night that quiet could be restored in three tosix months.   ``I believe that the events of the last several days can become aturning point leading to a significant decrease in violence,'' hesaid.   He expressed hope that many Palestinians would be content with``achieving their aim and allowing the political process'' but saidIsrael ``should continue to supress violence and block the PLOdeception attempt by political action.''   In Jerusalem on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry officials announced adiplomatic campaign against the Palestine Liberation Organization'sdrive for recognition of its self-proclaimed state.   The effort will focus on the PLO's failure to renounce terrorism,to accept U.N. Resolution 242 unconditionally or to clearlyrecognize Israel, one official said. He said Israel will argue thatthe resolution, which implicitly recognizes the the Jewish state'sright to exist, cannot be amended.   The PLO said it was accepting the resolution on condition thePalestinian right to self-determination is also recognized.   Palestinian hardliners said they opposed the declaration, and thefundamentalist Moslem Hamas (Zeal) movement called a three-daygeneral strike to protest the declaration's implicit recognition ofIsrael.   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres complained that recognition of thewould-be Palestinian state would interfere with any peace process.   He told reporters that recognition, now by more than 20 mostlyArab countries, ``further complicates the situation by supportingsomething that shouldn't be supported.''   On Wednesday, Palestinians kept up their nightly revelrycelebrating the Algiers independence statement. Youths danced in thestreets in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, and firecrackers roundedthrough Gaza City.   A 25-year-old man wounded in the head three days ago in the GazaStrip town of Rafah died Wednesday, raising to 313 the number ofPalestinians killed in the nearly year-long uprising against 21years of Israeli occupation. Eleven Israelis also have died.   Also in Gaza, military appeals court rejected appeals of eightArab activists slated for deportation but upheld two other appealsconditional on approval of military officials, Israel televisionsaid. It said the eight planned to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.   Since the uprising started, Israel has deported 33 Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
