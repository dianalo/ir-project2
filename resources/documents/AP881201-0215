In a Louisiana parish, the police chief wanted the names of thosewho had checked out library materials on the occult, not becausethere was a problem ``but just in case there might be one in thefuture.''   Increasingly librarians resist requests for records of whatbooks, films or other materials their patrons check out. They saythe borrowings could be misinterpreted, placing innocent peopleunder false suspicion.   Further, said Ohio Library Association executive director BonnieBeth Mitchell: ``If people really understood what they could getabout other people ... by tapping their library records, we'd be outof the library business.''   In this state, where an Open Records law does not exempt libraryrecords from public scrutiny, librarians have proposed legislationto make the records confidential. Thirty-eight states and theDistrict of Columbia already have such a statute, requiring a courtorder to release the records.   ``We're not obstructionists,'' said Judith Krug, director of theAmerican Library Association's Office of Intellectual Freedom inChicago. ``We just want to be sure the police or anybody else justcan't walk in half-cocked for no good reason.''   Ms. Krug said the organization has fought since 1970 againstreleasing records.   She cited the Louisiana case, calling the police chief's request``absolutely ridiculous,'' and she recalled a librarian at BucknellUniversity in Lewisburg, Pa., who spent 15 days in jail in the early1970s for refusing federal investigators' demand for the records ofVietnam war protesters Daniel and Philip Berrigan.   The case was one of the factors that led to Pennsylvania'sdecision to pass a confidentiality law, she said.   Besides Ohio, the states that do not have library confidentialitylaws are Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, New Hampshire, NewMexico, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Kentucky and Texas, althoughattorneys general in the latter two states have issued opinionsfavoring confidentiality.   In the Ohio battle over the Open Records law, law enforcementlobbyists say library records are a valuable if rarely usedinvestigative tool they will not relinquish.   The Ohio Library Association, however, calls public access to therecords a loophole in the law and an assault on the First Amendment.   The difference of opinion has forced many of Ohio's 250 publiclibraries to adopt policies that contradict the law. In 1983, onelibrarian nearly landed in jail for his defiance.   The Ohio Library Association and the Ohio Library TrusteesAssociation, with 4,100 members between them, drafted legislationthat would make patron records confidential, permitting theirrelease to police only under a court order.   The measure cleared the state Senate but has been stalled byopposition in a House committee _ and now Ms. Mitchell saidamendments have changed the bill so much the library groups nolonger support it.   The amendments, backed by the Ohio Association of Chiefs ofPolice and the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association, would, amongother things, eliminate the court-order requirement.   The OLA plans to re-introduce its bill next year.   A survey conducted by the association earlier this year foundthat six of 40 libraries questioned had received requests from localand state police for information about patrons and what they hadborrowed. Eighteen reported that patrons had inquired about fellowpatrons.   In all of the instances, including the case of the allegedwitchcraft rituals in Defiance County, the requests were rejectedunder library policies that forbid release of such informationwithout a court order.   The FBI also is interested in the reading habits of librarypatrons and has tried to recruit library personnel around thecountry to watch their patrons, according to recently releasedfederal records.   An FBI agent visited the University of Cincinnati library in 1985and again in 1986 to check the reading lists of two Soviet citizens,said the American Library Association. Both times, the agent'srequest was rejected by head librarian Dorothy Byers.   Librarians would prefer that none of the patron-relatedinformation they guard be made public, but realize a need to helpthe authorities in legitimate cases, Ms. Mitchell said.   ``We're not refusing to help. In fact, we want to,'' she said.``But we will not allow fishing expeditions, and we will not allowinnocent people to be put under suspicion simply because they use alibrary.''   ``We're trying to protect people's rights here,'' she said.   Librarians also fear they will be held liable if information theyrelease results in harm to the patron, although an amendmentproposed by law enforcement groups would relieve a librarian ofcriminal or civil liability.   John Gilchrist, a lobbyist for the Ohio Association of Chiefs ofPolice, said another amendment was crucial: ``The OLA wants thepolice to testify about what they're looking for at a hearing beforethey get a court order. That hearing, which would probably bepublic, defeats the whole purpose of an investigation. You don'twant the person you're looking for to know you're looking for them.   ``That could put innocent people in a bad light.''   The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union thinkseven requiring a court order would be insufficient protection.   ``None of this should be made public,'' said ACLU ExecutiveDirector Ann Zeller. ``Opening these records to the police or thecourts would suddenly and improperly make someone a suspect merelybecause they like to read.''   Steven Hawk, executive librarian of the Akron-Summit CountyPublic Library, was threatened with jail for refusing to comply witha subpoena seeking a list of reading material requested by a jailinmate who was suspected in attacks on several women. The attackerhad quoted French writer Francois Villon.   Hawk said the subpoena, seeking a list of everything the manchecked out, was too broad. But after prosecutors agreed to rewriteit to specify release only of information related to Villon's works,the library complied. The inmate, who had indeed checked out Villon,was convicted. He had also been identified in a lineup.   Librarians say their policies protect the confidentiality of morethan patron reading lists.   Several libraries reported they have refused solitications fromcompanies asking to buy a list of patrons' names, addresses andtelephone numbers, and from collection agencies looking fordelinquent consumers.   The American Library Association this year launched an effort topass federal confidentiality legislation that would have coveredlibrary records and other services, including video rentals. The FBIhad sought access to library information without a court order incases involving national security. The bill died when Congressadjourned.   Said Ms. Krug, ``We're going to try again, and probably again.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, Dec. 7</NOTE></DOC>
