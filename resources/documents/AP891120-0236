Union members voted near Wichita, Kan., and were to gather inSeattle and Portland, Ore., to vote on the agreement reached Sundaywith the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets. Resultswere not expected until early Tuesday.   Tom Baker, president of Seattle's District Lodge 751 of theInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,predicted earlier that the deal would be overwhelmingly approved.Boeing chief negotiator Larry McKean said strikers could be back atwork Wednesday.   The company's second-longest strike virtually halted production,delaying deliveries to airlines at a time of growing passengerloads and rising concern over aging jets.   The Machinists union represents about 43,300 workers in Seattle,12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland and a few hundred more inscattered sites, including California, Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming,Montana, North Dakota and other states.   Reporters were barred from the meeting at the Kansas Coliseumnorth of Wichita. Dozens of people stayed only long enough to pickup a seven-page explanation of the offer.   There was no clearcut sentiment among union members who leftearly.   ``I voted to go back to work,'' said Rodney Nobles of Wichita.``I think it's a good contract. They gave us our lump-sumimprovements.''   Galan Smith, 22, of Wichita, said he voted against the contract.   ``We're wanting a larger wage increase in the general wage,'' hesaid. ``We've been out long enough, we feel like they should makeup for some of what we've gone through.''   Baker said the proposed contract substantially improves twoearlier Boeing offers, including boosting the total dollar value.   Other union leaders were less satisfied. Justin Ostro, aninternational union vice president who coordinates aerospaceindustry negotiations for the Machinists, said Boeing workers wereentitled to ``a great deal more.''   Boeing officials said they were pleased with the pact.   According to a handout distributed at the Kansas Coliseum, theoffer included four major improvements from the Oct. 3 proposalmachinists overwhelmingly rejected before going on strike the nextday:   _ Lump-sum bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year, 5percent the second and 4 percent the third.   _ A 60-cent-per-hour cost-of-living increase immediately, withquarterly increases thereafter.   _ An increase in the cost-of-living adjustment base pay by 45cents an hour to make up for a 1986 adjustment workers didn't get.   _ A cut in mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends and144 hours per quarter, with double-time pay after 160 hours, downfrom 200 mandatory hours of overtime per quarter and fourconsecutive weekends in the previous contract.   Machinists have said that after six years of accepting yearlybonuses rather than wage increases, Boeing workers were entitled toa healthy chunk of the company's prosperity.   Boeing had record earnings in its most recent quarter and has abacklog of orders for more than 1,700 jets worth about $85 billion,with delivery dates stretching beyond the turn of the century.   A settlement with Boeing machinists traditionally has set thepattern for other aerospace companies, especially Lockheed Corp.and McDonnell Douglas Corp., as well as for other unions at Boeing.   The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association,which represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers, hasagreed to extend its contract with Boeing, which expires Dec. 1.   Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia and United Auto Workers Local1069, which represents about 3,000 production workers, extendedtheir pact beyond its Oct. 4 expiration.   Union contracts between machinists at McDonnell Douglas inTorrence, Calif. and Lockheed Corp. at Burbank, Calif., expired inOctober, but negotiations have been extended. Those talks areseparate from the Boeing negotiations, and the outcome of theSeattle talks had no direct effect.   Don Nakamoto, spokesman for Machinists District Lodge 727 inBurbank, acknowledged the Boeing developments have been closelywatched.   ``I'm sure it will have some impact,'' Nakamoto said. ``It'shard to say what it will be but I think both parties will be takinga hard look to see what it means to our talks.''   During the strike, Boeing, using supervisory and non-strikingworkers, delivered 22 planes, but all were virtually complete andout of the factories before the walkout.   Boeing has said the strike will have a serious financial impactduring the last quarter of the year, but has not given specificforecasts.   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, lasted 45 days. There was a19-day strike in 1965, and a 140-day walkout in 1948.</TEXT></DOC>
