The Nasdaq Composite Index opened lower and drifted 1.44before recovering. Buying among smaller investors also isorderly and cautious, he said. Small investors appear to bebuying shares of companies researched by brokerage firmsrather than chasing after speculative stories, according toMr. Costanza.   Subaru of America was the day's most active issue, mainlybecause Cantor Fitzgerald traded two blocks of more than 2million shares each for buyers and sellers.   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan is in a pact to buythe 50.4% of Subaru it doesn't already own. Subaru rose 1/16to 8 1/4 on 5.8 million shares.   Telecredit tumbled 2 1/2 to 50 3/4 after the Los Angelesprovider of payment services said it agreed to be acquired byEquifax, an Atlanta business-services concern. The agreementcalls for a stock swap valued at about $580 million. Anarbitrager at one large New York brokerage said the stockstumbled because some investors think the proposedcombination may attract antitrust scrutiny. He added somespeculators had hoped Telecredit would be acquired in cash bya larger, international finance or data-processing firm.   MCI Communications, the day's second-most active stock,continued to drift, slipping 5/8 to 41 on 3.5 million shares.Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette telecommunications analyst JoelGross said in an interview that shares of the Washington,D.C., long-distance carrier reacted to a new AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph tariff regulation that gives ATandamp;T moreflexibility in competitive pricing. The regulation becameeffective by default after the Federal CommunicationsCommission failed to act on the proposed tariff within amandated time. However, Mr. Gross said he expects federalregulators to eventually rule against the new regulation.   MCI shares also have been pressured by the pending releaseof FCC market-share data, which may show ATandamp;T's market sharerising a bit. Mr. Gross added, however, that when the data isrevised it will show that ATandamp;T's market share is continuingto decline. He continues to rate MCI a &quot;buy.&quot;   Apple Computer added 1 7/8 to 41 7/8 on more than 1.9million shares, leading the technology group.

Westmark International leaped 2 1/2 to 39 1/2 after theSeattle medical-equipment maker said late Wednesday thatearnings for the second quarter ending June 30 will fall atthe low end of an estimated range of 45 to 50 cents a share,up from 39 cents a share a year earlier. The stock recentlyhad weakened amid some analysts' concerns the earningswouldn't meet that range.   Henley Properties added 3/4 to 6 3/4 after the Hampton,N.H., real estate development company said it expects netincome for the second quarter ending June 30 to be about $80million, up from $4.8 million on a pro forma basis a yearearlier. Henley also said it will sell its interests in twotrash-to-energy facilities for $10 million to WheelabratorTechnologies Inc. That will enable Henley to reverse about$100 million of deferred income currently included as aliability on its financial statements and increaseshareholders' equity by that amount, the company added.   LDDS Communications jumped 2 3/4 to 24, a new 52-weekhigh, apparently after Prudential-Bache analyst CharlesNichols initiated coverage of the Jackson, Miss., provider oflong-distance telecommunications services with a &quot;buy&quot;opinion, DJPIR reported.   General Binding lost 2 1/2 to 18 1/2 after the Northbrook,Ill., maker of business machines and supplies said it expectssecond-quarter earnings will fall to 30 or 31 cents a sharefrom 35 cents a year earlier because of weaker markets andhigher expenses. That's below analysts' expectations of 38cents a share.
