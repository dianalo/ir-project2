TheTomahawk cruise missile allows us to pinpoint command centersand leave the rest of Baghdad standing. The Patriot defensemissile now stands guard against potential poison-gas attackson innocent civilians in Israel as well as military personneland civilian bystanders in Saudi Arabia. But the systemsbarely scraped by the U.S. Congress; the House voted to killboth -- in the name of arms control.   Combat leads to serious thought, and perhaps now we canfinally get someone to listen to our longstanding complaintsthat the arms-control process is often perverse, hamperinggood weapons while preserving more destructive ones. Afterall, why should treaties on nuclear arms affect weapons in aconventional battle like Iraq? Why should arms control hamperweapons that, like the Tomahawk, avoid hurting civilians? Whywould any kind of arms control even think of limiting weaponsthat, like the Patriot, protect against what are essentiallyterror attacks and have no offensive capability?</LP><TEXT>   Yet while the Tomahawk and Patriot survived inHouse-Senate conference committees, similar and relatedsystems did not. The epic debates over ABM and SDI, afterall, were over whether to give American civilians the kind ofprotection Israeli civilians have just received. Our sidepretty much lost with the 1969 ABM treaty, but the &quot;process&quot;is illuminated in the tale of the treaty and the Patriot.   The treaty is intended to limit systems that could shootdown intercontinental ballistic missiles. It doesn't quiteban such systems; each side is allowed one anti-missile sitewith 100 launchers. But Congress dismantled the site we didhave, partly because one site with a limited number ofmissiles is not cost-effective, and partly out of animusagainst any missile defense. The idea was that both sidesought to know they would be destroyed in a nuclear exchange-- in arms-control argot, mutual assured destruction, or MAD.   While it's immoral to shoot down a &quot;strategic&quot; missile,MAD thinking goes, it would be OK to shoot down a &quot;tactical&quot;one. The Soviet Scuds in Iraq are intermediate-rangeballistic missiles, or &quot;tactical&quot; IRBM, not &quot;strategic&quot;ICBMs. The Patriot was originally an anti-aircraft system,but as part of its SDI effort, the Reagan administrationproposed to upgrade it to have a capability against tacticalmissiles. Arms-control enthusiasts objected, saying thePatriot might not be able to tell a tactical missile from astrategic one.   &quot;Large-scale deployment of a Patriot with anti-missilecapabilities would almost certainly destroy the treaty,&quot; saidAlbert Carnesale, a member of the delegation that hadnegotiated the ABM agreement. Critics came up with a GAOreport as of 1980, saying the Patriot program &quot;was stillshowing a low reliability and experiencing performanceproblems.&quot; On these grounds, the House voted in 1986 to killresearch into defense against tactical missiles.   Happily, this amendment didn't make the final bill. We sawthe importance of missile defense in last night's televisionreports of attacks on Saudi Arabia. And the shipment ofPatriots to Israel has done much to stabilize the politics ofthe anti-Iraqi coalition by giving Israeli civilians someprotection in lieu of military retaliation. Back stateside,SDI is on the congressional chopping block and negotiationsare again under way for a new strategic-arms treaty. So whilethe Israelis have the Patriot, it remains to be seen whetherU.S. civilians will get the same kind of comfort aboutmissiles that threaten them.   As for the Tomahawk, you may wonder why it was fired froma World War II battleship. Well, on cruise missiles the&quot;process&quot; has contorted itself into the notion that themorality of the cruise missile depends not on what a weapondoes after it's launched, but on how it's carried aroundbefore it's launched. Air-launched cruise missiles werecrippled by Jimmy Carter's SALT-II, and ground-launchedcruise missiles by Ronald Reagan's INF treaty. Butsea-launched cruise missiles survived a number ofarms-control cliffhangers.   The Tomahawks that avoided the Iraqi civilians carried1,000-pound explosive warheads. But, the arms-control processhas noticed, a weapon that can carry a thousand pounds canalso carry a nuclear warhead. So in the 1979 SALT-II, allALCMs with a range of over 600 kilometers are counted asnuclear weapons. And in the 1987 intermediate-range NuclearForce Treaty, the zero option zeroed out European-basedconventional GLCMs as well as nuclear ones.   The Soviets have consistently insisted on a 600-kilometerlimit for SLCM as well, which is a bit much since nearly allof the U.S. is within 600 kilometers of the sea while littleof the Soviet Union is. In the Ford administration the SLCMlimit led to bitter internal debate that finally killed animpending treaty (and with it, some of the pro-treatyentourage felt, Mr. Ford's re-election). The Carteradministration accepted the SLCM limit, but only in atemporary protocol that quickly expired. The Reaganadministration won their deployment, but only after aconference committee overrode a House amendment effectivelyprohibiting them.   In the Ford administration debates, arms-control DirectorFred Ikle argued that cruise-missile limits were bad for armscontrol, for pretty much the reasons we saw in Baghdad lastweek. Among the many potential benefits of Iraq, maybe theBush administration will ask itself whether we really wantthe kind of arms control that's bad for civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
