 Adecision to upgrade the database system also coincided with a rethink ofoffice procedures -- now requiring multi-user access to a relational databasesystem supporting a variety of office functions, including fast look-ups fortelephone hot-line support.andM;R:BASEandM;Being an avid reader of the PC press and also believing that fire frequentlyaccompanies smoke--I decided not to give dBase IV the benefit of the doubt.andO;So--where to go?andP;  At this time, Microrim had taken back the distribution andsupport of its R:Base product in the UK from Microsoft and had released aninternational update -- Release 2.11 -- which got good reviews and seemed tomeet my requirements for a relational database manager.andM;Right from the word go, R:Base showed that its development team had given alot of thought to user support.andP;  The copious documentation is split intoseven sections to meet differing user needs.andP;  The user's manual and theBuilding Applications/Command Dictionary -- two manuals that are consultedregularly  by confident users -- are both 250 pages plus and are wellstructured and indexed.andP;  The first stop for new users is the very clear100-page Learning Guide, which gives a series of lessons based on sampledatabases covering R:Base database definition, commands, creation of formsand reports and also how to put the bits together into applications.andM;One powerful feature of R:Base is its user interface, appropriately namedPrompt by Example (PBE).andP;  R:Base can be used in two modes--experts can typein instructions at the command line and get things done quickly if thecommand is correct.andP;  Alternatively you let the PBE interface take you by thehand to guide and constrain you in making selections from alternativesdisplayed on-screen.andP;  On entering R:Base, as an alternative to typing incommands, PBE offers you access to the various R:Base modules such asdatabase definition, application generation, data entry, data modification,data query, SQL commands and R:Base utilities, through a menu system.andP;  ThePBE function extends down through to the data modification and query levelwhere its support becomes more potent.andP;  For example, in a database query suchas compute sum invtotal from tansacts where tdate eq 01/10/89' the onlyinformation needed to be typed in from the query would be 01/10/89 andeverything else is prompted in the correct syntactical sequence by the PBEinterface.andM;The next feature to come out of the R:Base tutorial is a database designphilosophy that makes information (fields) independent from the forms thatdisplay the information.andP;  Traditionally, a form is used to define the fieldsyou require and then provides the only way accessing those fields.andP;  R:Baselets you first define the fields you want to store.andP;  Later, you can decide toaccess any field in as many different forms as you require and also to bringtogether fields from different tables into view--a much more open approach toinformation retrieval.andM;R:Base supports text, time, currency, real, double-precision, integer andnote fields and computed columns based on values of other fields in therecord.andP;  When fields are defined -- or later -- you can also specify dataentry rules for each field and messages to display to the operator if therule is broken.andP;  New fields can be added or existing fields deleted withouthaving to reload the data into the database.andM;A DataEase for is designed using the 'Forms Express' -- a slick module whereyou simply paste the fields you require in any order on the form and addforeground and background colours plus text to structure the appearance ofthe form.andP;  Forms Express lets you define whether the form will be used fordata entry or editing or both.andP;  It also allows you to define the contents ofthe menus used during forms processing and lets you set passwords for theform.andM;You can define a region on a form which will display multiple rows (records)from a specified table.andP;  In this way, you can set up a scrolling region on aform which will display selected information.andP;  'Behind' any field in a formyou can add an expression which will look up values in the current table orin other tables to select records for editing or entry.andM;Data retrieval from R:Base is catered for in two ways -- by ad hoc queriesusing R:Base's query language and through the Reports Express module.andP;  For adhoc queries you build up a query expression under the expert guidance of PBE.andO;Here you can Select, Browse, Compute, Tally and Crosstabulate informationselected by search criteria.andP;  R:Base's SQL module also gives PBE support toR:Base's partial implementation of SQL.andP;  The PBE query facility is great forquick screen-based interrogations -- but it's limited in scope.andP;  For example,when specifying search criteria based on 'and' and 'or' operators, PBEdoesn't let you group terms using parentheses.andM;For more sophisticated queries.andP;  R:Base's Reports Express module lets youlayout a report with headers and footers, set page lengths and set up grouptotals and other statistic to be included in the report.andP;  A report can accesslocal; global and system variables--such as date and time -- and also draw onR:Base's comprehensive range of math functions to perform complexcalculations.andP;  I found, however, that the R:Base approach to reportgeneration wasn't easy to master and was a distinct contrast with theusefulness of the PBE for quick data query.andM;R:Base's Application Express is a real time-saver for new users who haven'tyet mastered the intricacies of the R:Base query language.andP;  ApplicationExpress uses the PBE interface to let you generate a menu-driven system forbasic procedures to add, edit, delete, display records and generate simplereports.andP;  Once you've selected the appropriate procedures it goes away andgenerates the necessary code, including default form and report layouts.andO;While the scope of the procedures that can be generated are limited,Application Express gets a basic system up and running very quickly.andM;One problem I ran straight into was that the transition from a very basicdatabase system generated by Application Express to something approaching acompetent multi-user office support system required a quantum leap in effortand competence.andP;  While the R:Base language may be very powerful I found thatit lacked the clear definitions you expect from a programming language andalso it didn't provide sufficient structures to make a system programmer'slife convenient.andM;As I got deeper into my application, I found that I was spending excessiveamounts of time trying to code ways to do things that should have beenfeatures of the product, or to do things the way that suited my applicationrather than in the way that R:Base insisted.andP;  My feeling is that to programapplications successfully in R:Base you have to take a delight inclever-clever coding and in finding work-arounds.andP;  Almost everything I setout to code required pretty mind-bending programming and a lot of patientsupport from the R:Base techies.andM;For my office telephone support system, one requirement was fast access toindividual records by searches based on a surname field and on one or moreother fields such as postcode or town.andP;  The system should work on partialdata such as the first part of a surname.andP;  A major difficulty in achievingthese goals was that in R:Base, access to information in a current form ismade using an expression called a master look-up applied to a single field.andO;This then pulls in the record containing the first occurrence of the searchstring and you have to select 'next' to work through each successiveoccurrence until you make a hit.andP;  In my case, with a 12,000 record databasecontaining 100s of Smiths and Jones -- and without the ability to include asecond criterion such as initial, town or postcode.andM;Other silly problems also plagued my application development -- the R:Basemailing-label utility only supports four lines per label and, of course, Irequired five lines.andP;  Here, I found that coding a suitable mailing-labelformat in R:Base code proved to be difficult and messy, as was sendingcontrol strings to a printer.andP;  The absence of case statement structures inthe R:Base language to support the use of 'if-thens' made a number ofprocedures very messy and error prone -- such as allocating individuals toregional groups on the basis of postcode.andM;The final straw came when I realized that it was beyond my competence toreduce the search times for data to an acceptable level.andP;  I was never able toget information up on screen in much less than a minute from my 12,000 recorddatabase -- it seems that R:Base has rather idiosyncratic rules about when ituses indexes.andP;  The combination of difficulties in getting R:Base to work forme forced the decision to abandon the effort I'd put into R:Base and to trypastures new.andM;DataEaseandM;My route out of the abyss came courtesy of PC User -- I'd noticed thatSapphire's DataEase in its various guises had won successive Pc User ShowDatabase challenges.andP;  So, resisting the temptation to try also-ran Borland'sParadox, I gave DataEase version 4.01 my challenge.andM;My very first reactions, after having been immersed in R:Base for so long,weren't good.andP;  DataEase still holds on to the forms-based definition of dataso that information can only be accessed using the form that was used atodefine it.andP;  As it turned out, this wasn't unduly restricting since DataEase 4has a number of features that adapt this design philosophy to a relationalenvironment giving acceptable access to data.andM;The first is that within any form (table) any related form can be defined asa sub-form.andP;  Further, the sub-form can be set to repeat or scroll.andP;  Let'stake the example of a sales processing application with one table used forcustomers and a second for invoices -- linked by a customer ID number.andP;  Theform/sub-form feature could be used to display customer details on-screenaccompanied by a sub-form region through which the details of each relatedinvoice could be scrolled.andP;  With this feature it was easy to set up screensthat brought together information from more than one table -- but it requirescareful data structure planning to optimize information access.andM;Another DataEase feature that supports access to related information isDataEase's use of the F10 function key.andP;  F10 brings up a list of relatedforms for selection and viewing; Alt-F10 displays a related form open at arelated record and Ctrl-F10 allows you to select information from a relatedform to paste back into the current form.andP;  DataEase can process up to 40relationships within a database and offers a very powerful environment forprocessing data stored in relational structures.andM;As my DataEase exploration progressed, my initial hostility was quicklysubdued.andP;  On transferring the database information from R:Base to DataEase(an almost trivial procedure) I found that the basic DataEase form created todefine the data record could easily process the multi-criteria look-ups thatwere essential for my application.andP;  Multi-criteria look-ups can be carriedout as a matter of routine and without any additional programming.andO;Information from my 12,000 record database took only two to three seconds toappear on-screen from across the LAN.andP;  To say that I found DataEase'sperformance acceptable is an understatement--I was over the moon.andP;  Myprevious experience with R:Base had conditioned me to expect look-up times ofaround a minute, with similar queries on the same data across the same LAN.andM;In comparison with R:Base's very slick PBE, in DataEase, a new user finds itmore difficult to generate procedures for basic queries -- such as countingthe number of records meeting a particular criterion.andP;  One reason is thatR:Base's PBE interface and language structure make light work of such tasks.andO;PBE is great for straightforward queries, but when you graduate to morecomplex queries or procedures you have to use an editor without any supportapart from the manual and your own ingenuity.andP;  DataEase has a PBE-likeinterface to its programming language, and while it's not as slick inoperation, it's interactive and far more powerful.andP;  This DataEase programmingeditor actively monitors the code as you write it and, at any point, it willalso prompt the syntactically correct options.andM;In this way, it's a very powerful aid for generating queries and proceduresthat draw on the entire DataEase Data Query Language (DQL), with the addedvirtue of not allowing code to be saved unless it's syntactically correct.andO;But, because it requires a nodding acquaintance with DQL, the DataEaseprogramming editor requires a bit of effort on the part of new users, even togenerate simple reports.andP;  After that initial effort, it's a highly supportiveand productive tool and a good way of exploring and learning DQL.andM;DataEase's DQL language itself is well thought out and contains a lot offunctions that ease the programming load and make the life of the systemprogrammer a lot easier.andP;  Also, in a multi-user data-share conflict, itautomatically signals who is hogging the data.andP;  The basic data types aretext, integer, fixed and floating point, numeric string, yes/no, date, time,currency, choice and extended text.andP;  The choice field type -- in which inputto a field is constrained by allowing the operator to select only from a listof predetermined items -- was very welcome.andP;  In R:Base, this facility had tobe programmed in and took a lot of effort.andM;DQL has a rich selection of string-handling and math/stats functions and isgenerally supportive to programmers.andP;  DQL is also a powerful tool for reportgeneration.andM;In fact, DataEase is geared to supporting individual operators by making itvery easy to generate customized menus, giving them just the procedures theyneed.andP;  Also, each individual user can be given password protected entry witha data access level ranging from enter/change/look to look only.andM;In practice, this security system turned out to be DataEase's Achilles heel.andO;The reason was that, in my environment, each operator had only a restrictedrole within the office structure -- needing full rights on some forms,viewing only rights on others and to be locked out completely from others.andO;Infortunately, the basic DataEase security system can't cope with this commonrequirement because access rights allocated to individuals apply across allforms.andP;  It was possible to program a solution in which individuals are deniedaccess to specified forms, but this requires familiarity with the DQLlanguage and with the general organization of DataEase databases.andM;After a couple of weeks development and testing, I successfully installed myoffice system.andP;  It's still being fine-tuned to meet office needs, but it'sproved to be stable, vice-free and hasn't produced any difficulties in use.andO;Installation was easy and the documentation clear, well-indexed,well-structured and easy to access.andM;Thanks DataEase, you saved my bacon -- my remaining criticism is that the DQLlanguage section in the manual is rather light on examples.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
