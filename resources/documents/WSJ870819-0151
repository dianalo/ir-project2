Kasper's Aug. 3 editorial-page article &quot;Toward Open Skies World-Wide&quot;:    There is a problem, but it is not U.S. protectionism. It is that few foreign markets -- whether national or regional -- are characterized by the growth and dynamism that the U.S. market has enjoyed since deregulation. There may be a &quot;world-wide move toward more open {aviation} markets,&quot; as Mr. Kasper suggests, but it can't be seen without the aid of time-lapse photography. In circumstances like these, &quot;open skies&quot; is a very lopsided proposition. Simply stated, most large carriers want more from us, in terms of new service opportunities, than they are in a position to offer U.S. airlines in return.    Instead of casting doubt on the continuing U.S. commitment to an open environment, it would have been more helpful to ask when, if ever, foreign governments will finally stop treating airlines as though they were public utilities. In all likelihood the large, multinational airlines that Mr. Kasper envisions (and I think he's right) will have to come first. Perhaps then foreign governments will allow the carriers to behave like the commercial enterprises that they are. When they do, and foreign markets begin to offer U.S. airlines the exciting new possibilities that foreign airlines already see in the U.S. -- new gateway cities, marketing innovations, new traffic patterns -- we will have, at last, the ingredients for an enduring competitive, expansive air-services regime.
