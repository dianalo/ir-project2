Police said seven demonstrators were arrested at a protestoutside the South African Embassy and one was arrested outside Mrs.Thatcher's home, where she met with F.W. de Klerk, leader of SouthAfrica's governing National Party.   Mrs. Thatcher said after her meeting that she believed there wasa ``new mood'' in the racially segregated nation.   ``It was evident that there is a ... greater determination toresolve the great issues of the day through negotiation,'' said astatement issued by her office. ``Our hope ... is that these newopportunities will be grasped and there will be an end to violence.''   A protester splattered white paint on De Klerk's blue Jaguar ashe arrived at Mrs. Thatcher's residence and tried to rush toward thecar.   Police overpowered three protesters who broke from a group of 15holding banners near a security barrier about 40 yards from Mrs.Thatcher's front door.   Robert Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said Mrs.Thatcher should not engage ``in a process of dialogue with theapartheid regime.''   Outside the South African Embassy, 50 demonstrators banged drumsand blew whistles in a daylong protest. Some banners described deKlerk and Mrs. Thatcher as ``fascists.''   Others said ``Free Mandela Now,'' referring to black leaderNelson Mandela, who has been in prison since 1964 serving a lifeterm for sabotage and trying to overthrow the South Africangovernment. Mrs. Thatcher's statement said she had pleaded with deKlerk to release Mandela.   The statement also said she reiterated that she will not talkwith South African groups that practice violence, indicating shewill continue to refuse meetings with representatives of Mandela'sAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement.   At a news conference at the South African Embassy, De Klerk madeno reference to Mandela but said he and Mrs. Thatcher agreed ``aboutthe need for continued discussion and interaction between the twogovernments.''   De Klerk is to replace President P.W. Botha in September.   He called the news conference but then refused to answerquestions, saying he had to get to an appointment with ForeignSecretary Sir Geoffrey Howe.   De Klerk said he discussed with Mrs. Thatcher South Africa'sposition on ``constitutional development'' and ``the negotiationprocess.''   He appeared to be referring to the white-led government's sounsuccessful attempts to get black leaders to enter constitutionaltalks.   South Africa's apartheid system denies the nation's 28 millionblacks a vote in national affairs. The white minority of 5 millioncontrols the economy and maintains separate neighborhoods, schoolsand health services.   Mrs. Thatcher is the West's most outspoken opponent of imposingeconomic sanctions on South Africa to pressure it to end apartheid.She contends such sanctions cost jobs, including in Britain, hurtSouth Africa's black majority most and harden white resistance tochange.   De Klerk met in Bonn on Thursday with West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl. The South African leader also will visit Italy,Portugal and Switzerland.</TEXT></DOC>
