The unit train concept, a highlysuccessful and efficient means of conveying high-volume commodities suchas coal, is discussed. Initially-unknown cost factors were found to havea negative effect on profits from unit train operations: rail and wheellife is reduced, relative to normal train operations. However, the characteristicsof the unit train point out the way to increased cost efficiencies. Usingidentical cars in such trains allows spreading of a very firm volumeof fixed costs over more cars. Such cars can be constructed identically,allowing easier maintenance and operation. In view of the foreseeableincrease in unit train volume, other improvements in operational efficiencyinclude pooling of equipment to increase flexibility and optimize thetrain size, and increase effective utilization of trains by carryinga suitable return cargo. A program of increased capital expendituresby Canadian National Railways is outlined. Most of the money spent inthis program will be for construction in Western Canada, where most ofthe train movements associated with the coal industry are located. Researchand development is also described concerning a new kind of freight cardesigned to permit loop track unloading without uncoupling cars in theunit train. Some mention is made of new developments in locomotives,cabooses, scheduling, and unit train contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
