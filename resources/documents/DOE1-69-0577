On the one hand, the composition of the mostimportant constituent of the glass batch{--}the waste{--}may vary widely.On the other hand, the vitrification process itself must be tightly controlledto ensure product quality, public safety, and process reliability. Thishas led to several important developments in waste vitrification technology,all aimed at improving process control. These include use of processmodels, use of artificial intelligence techniques, and improved controland measurement of glass redox. 19 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
