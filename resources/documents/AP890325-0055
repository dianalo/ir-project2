ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the branch of the TAT-8 cable toBritain failed about 12:50 a.m. EST.   The cable splits into two branches as it approaches Europe, withone going to Britain and the other to France. The French linkfailed last Tuesday, and the traffic it normally carries had beenrerouted onto the British leg.   Linnen said ATandamp;T phone service to Europe was disrupted in theearly morning hours, but was restored by mid-morning via theIntelsat communications satellite.   The fiber-optic cable can handle up to 40,000 phone callssimultaneously, Linnen said. He said ATandamp;T knew the general locationof the failure but did not immediately know the reason.   ``You have to send a cable ship out and they have to go outwhere the fault is, and they just pull it up on board,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
