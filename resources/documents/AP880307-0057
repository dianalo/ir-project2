News reports said two men and a woman were killed Sunday afterthey planted a car bomb and set it to go off Tuesday during amilitary parade in this British colony.   But Howe denied the news reports and said no bomb had beenplanted.   He said a second car linked to the guerrillas and parked inSpanish territory near border with Gibraltar, a British colony,contained three false passports and equipment, including an alarmclock, insulating tape, gloves and wire.   ``There is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterday'sevents a dreadful terrorist act has been averted,'' said Howe,speaking to the House of Commons in London.   ``The three people killed were actively involved in the planningand attempted excecution of that act.'' He did not elaborate.   British news reports said the two men and a woman were killedafter authorities uncovered a plot to set off the car bomb. Thereports quoted unidentified security sources.   The reports said bomb-disposal experts defused 440 pounds ofexplosives in a Spanish-registered car parked near Gov. Sir PeterTerry's official residence in Gibraltar, on the southern tip ofSpain.   British Armed Forces Minister Ian Stewart said ``an intelligencetip-off'' led to information about the three members of the IrishRepublican Army, which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive theBritish out of Northern Ireland.   Ronald Sindon, a spokesman for the governor, said local policecoordinated the effort.   ``The operation was under the control of the Gibraltar policecommissioner, and British forces acted in support of Gibraltarpolice,'' he said.   In an interview in London today on the British BroadcastingCorporation's Radio 4 program, Stewart said the Gibraltargovernment of Chief Minister Adolfo Canepa asked Britain formilitary assistance ``under the standard arrangements because ofthe involvement of suspected terrorists.''   Stewart said the two men and a woman were unarmed when they wereshot and killed by members of the British Armed Forces.   Asked whether Gibraltar police participated in the shooting,Sindon said: ``I am not in a position to comment on operationalprocedures.''   In Madrid, Spanish State Security spokesman Augustin Valladolidsaid today Spanish police had tipped off British authorities morethan a month ago about the presence of the suspected IRA members onSpain's southern Costa del Sol.   Valladolid said British officials asked Spanish police to keepthe three under surveillance but not to intervene.   In a statement released Sunday in Belfast, the IRA said thethree were attached to ``active service units'' of its generalheadquarters in Belfast. It extended ``deepest sympathy to thefamilies of the volunteers.''   Independent Television in Britain today identified the three asMairead Farrell, 31; Don McCann, 30; and Sean Savage, 24. Thereport said they were driving to the airport when they were stoppedby the police.   It said Miss Farrell served part of a 14-year prison sentence inconnection with a hotel bombing in Belfast in 1976.   EFE, Spain's national news agency, said the car carrying thethree IRA members was stopped by police on a road leading to theSpanish border.   British newspapers today quoted witnesses as saying plainclothespolice officers jumped out of a vehicle and shot without warning atthe three. They said one man and the woman fell on the spot and theother man had run 300 yards toward the town center before he wasgunned down.   The Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quotedofficials as saying the purported bomb may have been timed to gooff Tuesday when soldiers of the Royal Anglian Regiment are to takepart in the changing of the guard ceremony.   The regiment has just completed a tour in Northern Ireland.   The Guardian, a London newspaper, said today police werecarrying out house-to-house searches in the Spanish border town ofLa Linea on Sunday night for other members.   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite NorthernIreland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland in asocialist state.</TEXT></DOC>
