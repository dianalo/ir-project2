Mr. Kruger lowered the tip of his graphite fly-rod and a combination of hook, tinsel, cork and fur settled onto the lake's surface, as gently as a leaf falling from a nearby cottonweed. He let the lure rest at the edge of a weed-line for a few seconds before giving the fly-line a jerk to begin the retrieve.    Water flew and the fly-rod sprang to life at the fish's jolting strike. Twice the fish leapt from the water, each time flying higher than its 15-inch length. When the battle was over, Mr. Kruger lifted the fish from the water, gently removed the hook from its jaw, admired it, and eased it back into the lake.    Seconds later he made another presentation with the lure, and again the result was a savage strike and a powerful fight. It was a scene repeated dozens of times in the fading two hours of daylight.    For many fly-fishermen such an experience would be associated with an expensive, heavily stocked private trout water or a long, back-country trek to a secluded mountain lake. But Mr. Kruger's success was due more to selection of species than location. The expert angler from Dora, Mo., was fly-casting for bass rather than the traditional trout. It's a sport that's now occupying a large part of his life.    Until recently a St. Louis-based editor at a successful outdoor magazine, Mr. Kruger moved to the Ozarks to focus on flyfishing for bass -- to write about it, to guide float-trips and to develop a line of lures. Industry experts say his timing is perfect.    &quot;People have really started to get turned on to bass fishing with a fly-rod,&quot; said Howard West, project manager for Scientific Anglers/3M, a leading manufacturer of fly-fishing equipment and videos. &quot;A real good barometer is the dramatic increase that companies like L.L. Bean and Umpqua (Feather Merchants, which produces fly-fishing lures) have had in bass bug sales. It's going right through the roof.&quot;    To many, something as seemingly slow and deliberate as a fly-rod might appear out of place for a fish that's developed a following among conventional anglers who cast rapid-fire big baits that shine, shimmy and rattle. But those who've tried it will tell you that fly-rodding for bass can be very, very effective.    &quot;I've been fishing against guides and good bass fishermen using regular tackle for years,&quot; said Mr. Kruger, &quot;and there's only been one time that the other person caught more bass than I did on a fly-rod. I've often out-fished them 10 to one, though they might catch a bigger bass.&quot;    The next morning Mr. Kruger literally fished shoulder-to-shoulder with an accomplished conventional bass angler. Mr. Kruger was the runaway winner in terms of quantity, while the other fisherman caught a bass that was slightly larger than the flyfisherman's best.    Still, Mr. Kruger said, you'll seldom hear a fly-fisherman complaining about size. Bass that are a disappointment to conventional anglers armed with high-speed reels and flagpole-stiff fishing rods are always welcomed by those using a long, limber fly-rod.    &quot;A two-pound bass on a fly-rod is more fun than a six-pounder on a bait-casting rod,&quot; said Mr. Kruger. &quot;Because the rod is so long and you hold the line directly in your fingers, you can feel every little fin vibration a bass makes.&quot;    Both Messrs. Kruger and West said the ability to have fun with small and fair-sized bass fits well into the fish's population trends. The past two decades of growing popularity has taken their toll on big bass over most of the U.S. Most bass get taken from the water as soon as they pass the local length limit.    There also appears to be another bit of demographics precipitating the rising interest in fly-rod fishing for bass. &quot;Every year we have a lot of people moving south, to states like Texas and Florida,&quot; said Mr. West. &quot;That's hardly trout country but they're still looking for something to fly-fish for.&quot;    Those transplanted anglers, as well as any fisherman in the U.S., will find plenty of places to work a fly-rod for bass. &quot;No matter where someone lives, there's usually a pond, lake or river with bass in it close by,&quot; said Mr. West.    And bass offer another bonus -- they're easily caught by beginners. &quot;Trout fishing can be pretty delicate for beginners,&quot; said Mr. West. &quot;The casting has to be exact . . . and then they'll often only sip a bait so softly it's hard to detect a strike unless you're experienced. But bass are explosive by comparison. With a bass it's more like someone throwing a bowling ball into the water.&quot;    The future will see it getting easier and easier for anglers to experience such a jarring strike and powerful fight on a lightweight fly-rod. Companies such as Scientific Anglers/3M are constantly improving lines, reels and rods to assist bass fishermen.    Fly-fishermen are also seeing a new generation of lures that are specifically designed for bass. One of Mr. Kruger's pet projects is to take the principles that have worked so well for conventional fishing and apply them to fly-fishing. I watched in amazement as one of his Krugercraft creations -- the Desperate Diver -- led both of us to nearly nonstop action on that small Kansas lake. &quot;It's designed to dive and wobble underwater just like a traditional bass lure you'd throw with a regular fishing rod,&quot; said Mr. Kruger. &quot;But it's much more effective and the fish are a lot more enjoyable to catch on a fly-rod.&quot;    ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance writer in Manhattan, Kan. </TEXT></DOC>
