Since the service's debut June 1, the firm's three boats havecruised past cars on choked streets to ferry about 600 passengers aday from central London to the booming Docklands area.   The catamarans _ twin-hulled boats that can reach speeds ofabout 28 mph _ carry up to 62 passengers and are powered by twoturbo-charged Volvo jet engines.   One leaves Charing Cross Pier in London's West End every 15minutes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. for a five-mile journey to the Isleof Dogs, heart of the sprawling Docklands redevelopment area, wheredecrepit warehouses are being turned into modern residential andlight industry complexes.   The full trip with two stops takes 20 minutes. A similar journeyon the London Underground subway takes up to 30 minutes, LondonRegional Transport spokesmen said.   One big difference is the price. The subway trip costs 80 pence,or $1.36, each way. The catamaran ride costs 4 pounds, or $7.20,each way.   ``There's an element to competing with all forms of transport,''Mabbott said, ``but what we're looking to provide is service toplaces the Underground, buses and cars don't get to easily.''   Traditional ferries have not operated with the speed orfrequency of the Thames Line catamarans, Mabbott said.   Thames Line PLC was established with $8.1 million in 1986 tosimultaneously develop property in the Docklands and create a rivershuttle for the growing number of people living and working there.   Mabbott said Thames Line's operating costs for June broke evenat $108,600 to $126,700, with the boats carrying an average of fivepassengers per trip.   He expects 80 percent of the passengers to be commuters orbusiness people with an interest in the Docklands, and 20 percenttourists.   Passengers last week gave Thames Line generally favorablereviews, but one said some problems still need working out.   Hugh Mackay, 45, a civil engineer from the northern Londonsuburb of Rickmansworth, complained his boat left Charing CrossPier 20 minutes late.   ``They need to improve their scheduling if business people aregoing to use it,'' he said.   Rhonda Kufluk, 36, a property developer, lives in the Docklandsand uses the service daily. ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``I hatetaxi cabs. The Tube (subway) tends to be overcrowded anduncomfortable.''   Thames Line plans to put four more boats in operation by Octoberand extend its service farther east past Charing Cross to Chelseaand farther west to Greenland Pier in the Docklands, Mabbott said.</TEXT></DOC>
