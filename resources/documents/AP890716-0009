For the first time in 15 years, an extensive portion of the finalcommunique was devoted to environmental problems. The summit leadersendorsed the Bush administration's strategy for solving the problemof Third World debt and touted their efforts in improving the worldeconomy.   The leaders, citing the harmony of the summit, were adjourningearlier than planned. That, too, was unprecedented in the era ofeconomic summitry.   French President Francois Mitterrand, the host of the three-daygathering, read the final communique and indicated that the summithad concluded.   In his closing remarks, Mitterand said that the leaders of theseven nations ``do not pretend to substitute ourselves for others.We are women and men of good will. We want to put ourselves at theservice of all humanity. That is the significance of our work.''   President Bush expressed his gratitude to the French presidentand the host country, saying, ``we thank him for the way in which heconducted the meeting and we thank his fellow citizens.''   In a final communique, the leaders said, ``There is growingawareness throughout the world, of the necessity to preserve betterthe global ecological balance.''   The leaders of France, West Germany, Britain, Japan, Canada,Italy and the United States were caught off-guard Saturday by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request that the Soviet economy belinked to that of the West.   ``Our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending towardfull and entire participation in the world economy,'' Gorbachevwrote to Mitterrand. It ``is obvious that the rest of the world canonly gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such asthat of the Soviet Union.''   The letter was the main topic of discussion among the leadersSaturday night.   They put the finishing touches on their final communique at amorning plenary session Sunday.   In the draft, the leaders said there is a ``serious threat to theatmosphere, which could lead to future climate changes.''   The leaders also expressed concern about the ``growing pollutionof air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas.''   ``Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concertedinternational response and for the early adoption, worldwide, ofpolicies based on sustainable development.''   On economic issues, the summit nations also endorsed the U.S.debt reduction strategy unveiled by Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady on March 10. U.S. officials had hoped that Mexico, the plan'stest case, would come to agreement with its creditors before theconclusion of the summit.   While the so-called Brady plan was not mentioned by name, thecommunique clearly endorsed it, urging commercial bankers to``increasingly focus'' on reducing debt service costs to complimentnew loans to those countries.   ``Our approach to the debt problems has produced significantresults, but serious challenges remain,'' they said.   The leaders found much to boast about in the performance of theeconomy this year, but they did call for ``continued vigilance''against the problem of rising inflation.   ``Inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive afirm policy response so that it will be put on a downward path,''the communique said.   It singled out the United States, Canada and Italy as countriesin which ``further reductions in budget deficits are needed.''   ``Action will be taken to bring them down,'' the statement said.``This may help reduce the savings-investment gap and externalimbalances, contribute to countering inflation and encourage greaterexchange rate stability in a context of decreasing interest rates.''   The communique also addressed the growing drug problem with theleaders saying the situation ``has reached devastating proportions''and requires speedy action.   ``We urge all countries, especially those where drug production,trading and consumption are large, to join our efforts to counterdrug production, to reduce demand, and to carry forward the fightagainst drug trafficking itself and the laundering of itsproceeds,'' the declaration said.   The leaders ended their 27-page statement with a reference to theinternational ethics committee on the deadly AIDS virus which met inParis in May. The communique made no recommendations or suggestions.   But, as promised, the focus of the declaration was on theenvironment, a subject in which President Bush has sought to takethe lead.   Bush began his final full day in France by attending churchservices at the 104-year-old American Cathedral of Paris. He joinedthe congregation in praying for the economic summit, a betterdialogue between rich and poor nations and for the hostages beingheld in Lebanon.   Until the arrival of the Gorbachev letter, the debt problems ofPoland and of the Third World were the focus of the 15th summit,being held amid a series of extravaganzas marking the bicentennialof the French Revolution.   In Gorbachev's letter, the Soviet leader said his policy ofeconomic restructuring, known as perestroika, means that the SovietUnion wants ``full and entire participation in the world economy.''   Gorbachev suggested cooperation in easing the Third World's $1.3trillion debt, saying:   ``We see points of convergence and complementarity in theapproaches to global problems, in particular the solution to ThirdWorld debt.   ``It doesn't matter who gets credit for the best initiative. Theessential thing is that there is a real possibility to contributetogether to the efficiency of practical measures in the domain ofdebt.''   The letter was the primary subject of discussion at Saturday'sworking dinner under the gleaming glass Pyramid in the LouvreMuseum's Napoleon Courtyard.   ``If there was a common element of reaction (to the letter),''Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine told reporters afterward, ``itwas that if Gorbachev's initiative was inspired by the desire toinsert the Soviet Union progressively into the world economy, thatis a good thing.''   U.S. officials were intrigued by the overture, and White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the summit leaders found it``positive and supportive.''   But the officials also saw the idea as impractical, and one said``It's going to be tough until he has a convertible ruble,'' in ajoking reference to the weak Soviet currency.   On Saturday, the summit leaders issued declarations on China,East-West relations, terrorism and human rights.   The East-West declaration stated their willingness to give aid toPoland and Hungary in support of moves toward democracy and a freemarket economy. The summit partners noted the food scarcity inPoland, and a European official said shipments of surplus food fromEuropean Common Market stocks could begin within two weeks.   The summit leaders denounced Beijing authorities for crushing thepro-democracy movement, and urged the World Bank to deny new loansto China.   They also pledged to guard against human rights violations andcondemned terrorism.   Apparently referring to Iran and its surrogates in Lebanon andSyria, the leaders called for those with influence overhostage-takers to bring about the release of the captives. Fifteenforeigners are being held in Lebanon, including the citizens ofthree summit nations, the United States, Italy and Britain.   The leaders also agreed to set up an international task force totrace laundered money as a way of fighting the international tradein illicit drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
