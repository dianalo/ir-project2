On other futures markets Friday, precious metals, grains,soybeans, energy, livestock and meat futures all advanced whilecoffee fell slightly.   Most markets closed at noon local time and will not reopen untilTuesday morning. Trading activity was uniformly light as manytraders got an early start on the long Christmas weekend.   Copper settled 1.1 cents to 3.2 cents higher with the spotDecember contract at $1.605 a pound and the more actively tradedcontract for delivery in March at $1.393 a pound.   Prices advanced despite the Commodity Exchange's report of ahefty increase overnight in its warehouse stocks of copper. Comexcopper stocks rose by 1,376 tons to 9,582 tons.   Analysts said they expected the stocks report to put pressure onthe copper market, which saw the spot price hit a record high of$1.6475 a pound Dec. 8 on tight-supply fears.   Instead, said New York-based analyst Bernard Savaiko ofPaineWebber Inc., ``we closed stronger on lingering ideas thatthere's supply tightness that is not going to go away, especially ifthe economy remains resilient going into the first quarter of nextyear, which is normally the strongest period from a consumptionstandpoint.''   He said market players believed the rise in Comex stocks wastemporary and that some traders were surprised the copper market wasnot following last year's pattern of leaping higher each day as theend of the year approached.   ``But there's still a lack of production and strong demand, sowhile the pattern may not be repeating last year's exactly, thefundamentals are still strong,'' he said.   Also on the Comex, gold settled 30 cents to 70 cents higher withFebruary at $421.60 a troy ounce; silver was .20 cent to 1.1 centshigher with March at $6.275 a troy ounce.   Soybean futures made strong gains and grain futures closedmoderately higher Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumorsof new export business with the Soviet Union.   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced a sale of750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviets, confirming one ofthe rumors that swept the grain pits during the shortened session.   The USDA confirmed another rumor when it announced it hadtargeted the Soviet Union for 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat atsubsidized prices.   And the USDA also said it had increased the amount of grain theSoviets could buy annually under the two nations' long-term grainagreement to 16 million metric tons from 12 million metric tons.   One rumor that was not confirmed was that the Soviets had alreadypurchased as much as 1 million metric tons of U.S. soybean meal,analysts said.   ``These rumors ... kept sellers on the sidelines,'' said VictorLespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $4.40{ abushel; corn was \ cent to 1} cents higher with March at $2.84\ abushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with March at $2.37 abushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents higher with January at$7.96{ a bushel.   Coffee futures prices slipped on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; CocoaExchange on news that a Brazilian dockworkers' strike had ended. Thestrike began Dec. 13.
