However, Arthur C. Upton, chairman of the NRC committee thatmade the study, said, ``The average citizen should not view this asa source of great concern.''   Upton said he expects that agencies worldwide that set industryradiation exposure standards will reassess the risks as a result ofthe NRC study. Although he said the committee did not recommendchanges, he did say, ``I personally expect that there will bechanges.''   The committee reassessed the health effects of low-levelradiation using new data developed from studies of survivors fromthe World War II atomic bombings in Japan; from other ``irridatedpopulations,'' such as workers in atomic industries, and fromanimals studies.   Experts on the committee also revised previous mathematicalmethods of estimating risks from low-level radiation.   Using the new information and methods, the committee concludedthat the risk for solid tumor cancer is three times greater than anearlier NRC estimate, and the risk for leukemia is four timesgreater.   The committee also found a much greater danger for mentalretardation among unborn babies exposed to low-level radiation inthe eighth to 15th weeks after conception.   The committee found that women are slightly more likely than mento develop cancer from low levels of radiation, and that in sometypes of cancer, children are more susceptible to radiation'seffects than are adults.   Upton, who is chairman of the Department of EnvironmentalMedicine at New York University Medical Center, said the study``merely endorses earlier reports that we really don't know thatthere is a safe level'' of radiation exposure.   He emphasized that the findings should not prevent patients fromreceiving appropriate diagnostic X-rays or treatments because theadded risk from such medical radiation is very slight.   ``A chest X-ray might increase (an individual's) risk by 1 in amillion,'' he said. ``It's essentially negligible. But it's notnegligible to public health authorities'' who analyze risks for thepopulation as a whole.   Unneccessary X-rays, however, said Upton, ``should be avoided.''   Seymour Jablon, a National Cancer Institute scientist who was onthe NRC committee, said ``the bottom line is that you ought toavoid radiation whenever you can. But there are certain benefits,such as medical X-rays, that outweigh the risk.''   Many of the study's conclusions are based partly on the medicalhistory of 76,000 survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings in Japan, afactor that powerfully influenced the new cancer risk estimates.   Previously, the committee said, neutron radiation waserroneously considered to have a major influence on the health ofthe A-bomb survivors. Removing neutrons from the equation, it said,means that the survivors are experiencing higher rates of cancerfrom lower radiation doses.   This is interpreted by the committee to mean that there is anincreased risk of cancer and other health problems from low-levelradiation.   Dose and duration of exposure generally determine healtheffects, the committee said.   In the United States, for instance, natural background radiationgives an exposure of 0.1 to 0.3 REMs a year. REM stands for ``radequivalent in man'' and is a unit of measure used to describe abiological effect from a level of radiation exposure.   A routine chest X-ray gives an added exposure of 0.06 REM;occupational standards limit nuclear workers to an annual exposureof no more than 5 REM.   The committee estimated that a single burst of 10 REM radiationexposure will result in 790 excess cancer and leukemia deaths per100,000 people. For this same exposure, a 1980 National ResearchCouncil report estimated cancer deaths per 100,000 people at 80 to230..   For a lifetime radiation exposure of 0.1 REM a year, the newstudy estimated 520 male cancer deaths per 100,000 men, and 600deaths per 100,000 women. The 1980 report estimated cancer deathsat 25 to 119 for this rate of exposure.   The NRC, which organized the committee study, is the researcharm of the National Academy of Sciences, a congressionallychartered private organization that conducts research at therequest of the government.</TEXT></DOC>
