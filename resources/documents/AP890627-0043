In two 5-4 votes Monday, the Supreme Court said theConstitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibitexecution of juveniles as young as age 16 or adults with thereasoning capacity of children.   Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers noted that the court lastyear threw out the death sentence of an Oklahoman who murdered atage 15, and said the rulings together provided a clear agedelineation for prosecutors and lawmakers considering capitalpunishment.   ``Lines have to be drawn somewhere,'' Bowers said on ABC-TV's``Nightline'' program. ``I do not think the line is drawninappropriately.''   Henry Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties Union'scapital punishment project in New York, however, called the decision``barbaric and medieval.''   ``If you were to open up the paper tomorrow and read that theFrench government or the British or some other civilized nation wereholding 30 kids that were going to be executed, you'd think, `GoodGod, wrong dateline. They mean Iraq or Bangladesh,'' Schwarzschildsaid.   Of the 2,200 convicted murderers on death rows in the UnitedStates, at least 32 committed their crimes under age 18.   At least 11 states have one or more inmates under a death penaltyfor crimes committed before they were 18, according to stateofficials. Texas topped the list with nine, followed by Alabama andGeorgia with four each.   Mike Hoey, a lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic Conference, saidthe ruling probably will make it more difficult to persuade statelawmakers to pass a measure setting 18 as the minimum age at whichmurderers can be subjected to capital punishment.   Hoey, who unsuccessfully pushed such a measure during the 1989session, said many lawmakers think it's ``political suicide'' tovote against the death penalty, although voters who support capitalpunishment might be more lenient toward teen-agers.   ``Adolescents don't think out the consequences of their acts,''Hoey said. ``It's an emotional, turbulent time of their lives.Although they can do adult acts, they don't think like adults.''   The high court's ruling upheld death sentences for KevinStanford, who was 17 when he abducted and murdered a gas stationattendant in 1981, and Heath Wilkins, 16 when he stabbed a KansasCity, Mo., area liquor store clerk to death in 1985.   Wilkins' crime was especially gruesome. He stabbed Nancy Allen, a26-year-old mother of two, in the back and chest, and stabbed herfour times in the throat after she pleaded for mercy.   Missouri Attorney General William Webster said arguments that theruling would lead to large-scale executions of minors was``hogwash.''   ``There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door.That's ludicrous,'' said Webster.   Webster said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty,he or she has to be certified as an adult, go through a battery ofmental exams and have their age considered as a mitigatingcircumstance by the judge.   William L. Touchette, the attorney for Paula Cooper, said theruling probably will not affect her case. She was 15 when shestabbed a retired Gary, Ind., Bible teacher to death. Her case hasdrawn international attention and a call for clemency from Pope JohnPaul II.   In its ruling, the Supreme Court said convicted murderers have aright to demand that sentencing juries and judges consider mentalretardation as a possible mitigating factor.   Arguments on cruel and unusual punishment have been raised in twopending California cases with mentally impaired defendants, saidDeputy Attorney General Dane Gillette in San Francisco.   In one case, James Richard Odle of Pinole was sentenced to deathfor the 1980 slaying of a woman and the killing of a policeman threedays later.   Defense lawyers have cited the brain damage Odle suffered in a1973 auto accident and a later lobotomy operation that removed aportion of his brain. In the second case, Melvin Meffrey Wade, amentally disturbed San Bernardino man, was condemned for the torturemurder of his 10-year-old stepdaughter in 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
