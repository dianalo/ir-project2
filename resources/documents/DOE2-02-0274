<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0274 </DOCNO><TEXT>The diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging is examined in relationto computed tomography on the basis of 66 patients, who had pathologicalprocesses in the midfacial and nasopharyngeal space. The high power ofcontrast resolution in imaging soft tissue masses and the direct multiplanarcapability of magnetic resonance offer advantages over computed tomographyin respect of space occupying lesions in the median and lower parts ofthe craniofacial skull. Lymph nodes of more than 1 cm in diameter weredetected by both modalities. A disadvantage is the poorer detectabilityof tumour conditioned bone destruction at the base of the skull. In suchcases, computed tomography remains the method of choice.</TEXT></DOC>
