In this year's third quarter, staying out of high-tech issues was the key. &quot;High technology just got slaughtered,&quot; says Melissa Brown, director of quantitative analysis for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    That, more than any other factor, determined the performance of stockbrokers' recommendations in the latest quarter, a study by The Wall Street Journal and Zacks Investment Research Inc. of Chicago shows. The quarterly study tracks the stock picks of the 10 brokerage houses with the most brokers, beginning June 30, 1986.    A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. beat the others in the latest quarter and in the latest 12 months; it has now also won the 12-month crown three times in a row. Edwards excelled when stock prices fell, and just tagged along when the market was hot.    But that's fine with research director Terry Dessent. &quot;The way you get superior performance is by outperforming in down markets and participating when the markets go up,&quot; he says. &quot;Preserving principal is how you make people real money.&quot;    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is the leader for the full 27 months covered by the study. The stocks it recommended posted a return of 25%, or about a 10.5% compound annual rate. Shearson, which favors companies with fast-growing earnings, held on to its leading position despite a subpar third quarter.    Over the past year, the winning stockpicking strategy has changed from quarter to quarter. Everyone's stocks suffered heavy damage in last year's fourth quarter -- the time of the crash. But Edwards and other firms that selected defensive issues such as utility stocks were hurt less than the rest.    The first quarter of this year saw a big run-up in shares of small companies. That helped firms such as Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and, again, Edwards.    In the second quarter, the market was dull and stayed within a narrow trading range. Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. led the field by emphasizing stocks that paid high dividends.    Here's a rundown on how the individual firms have done, and what their strategies are now.    A.G. EDWARDS: As it often has during the past year, the St. Louis firm showed up its nine New York competitors in the latest quarter. Edwards tends to select the stocks of relatively small companies, often not widely followed on Wall Street, that meet traditional &quot;value&quot; criteria. For example, it likes stocks that sell at a low multiple of the company's &quot;book value,&quot; or assets minus liabilities per share. It also favors stocks that pay good dividends. The average dividend yield of its recommended stocks is 3.7%, the second highest in the group after Smith Barney's 4.1%.    In the three months through Sept. 30, Edwards avoided biotechnology stocks altogether and didn't bet too heavily on high technology. It emphasized food, tobacco, utility and telephone stocks, and real estate investment trusts. Some of its winners last quarter were TJX Cos., up 30% on takeover rumors, Buffets Inc., up 21%, Martin Lawrence Ltd., up 19%, and Sara Lee Corp., up 17%.    SHEARSON: &quot;It was a bad quarter,&quot; says Jack Rivkin, director of research. &quot;We got killed in technology stocks. Also, we probably had too many energy stocks on the {recommended} list.&quot; Silicon Systems, down 27% in three months, exemplifies the computer and semiconductor stocks that hurt Shearson's recent performance. But the brokerage firm, a subsidiary of American Express Co., ranked high for 12 and 27 months. And Mr. Rivkin still believes high-tech stocks are &quot;the place to be&quot; for the long run. That includes Silicon Systems, which supplies circuits to computer disk-drive manufacturers. &quot;I believe in that company,&quot; he says.    SMITH BARNEY: Sticking to its &quot;total return&quot; approach, which emphasizes dividends, Smith Barney notched up another good quarter. The Primerica Corp. unit, which led the field in the second quarter, was No. 2 in the three months through Sept. 30.    &quot;Avoiding problems is the key thing,&quot; says D. Larry Smith, director of research. &quot;If you're sitting there with a stock that has an above-average (dividend) yield, you tend not to get battered around if you have a disappointment. Otherwise, an earnings shortfall or slip-up can cause a disaster.&quot; The study bears out his comments: For the latest quarter, Smith Barney's list was the only one without at least one stock that lost 15% or more. But it didn't have many big gainers, either.    PAINEWEBBER: Nice gains in the shares of Philip Morris Cos., RJR Nabisco Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., all up 15% to 17% in the latest quarter, bolstered the performance of PaineWebber Inc.'s recommended list. The firm also hit pay dirt with United Telecom, which was up 32% for the quarter.    But PaineWebber's picks also ran up losses of 20% or more in high-tech issues Tandem Computers, Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc. &quot;We are loath to walk away from them, despite the fact that they've been poor performers {lately},&quot; says James Voytko, director of research. The net result: PaineWebber is solidly in the middle of the pack for all periods.    DEAN WITTER: Manny Korman, research director at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., looks for companies selling below their &quot;take-out price.&quot; That's what a company might fetch in a takeover or buy-out. He uses that price as a yardstick of value, but says he isn't necessarily trying to pick the next takeover candidate. Until recently, in fact, he thought it was &quot;nuts&quot; to expect bids for huge companies such as RJR Nabisco, which was one of Dean Witter's best gainers in the quarter, up more than 16%. Dean Witter has been in the middle of the pack for the past quarter and 12 months. But for 27 months, it ranks last.    PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: &quot;Pretty miserable,&quot; says research director Michael Culp of Prudential-Bache's figures. The firm's recommendations came in last for the quarter, and underperformed Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index for all three periods. Mr. Culp is &quot;clearly not happy with the way the stock picking has been going of late.&quot; The firm, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, recently formed a stock-selection committee to provide &quot;a greater level of discipline without squashing the analysts,&quot; he says.    As for the last quarter? &quot;We were too bullish on technology and paid the price,&quot; he says. Intel, LSI Logic Corp., Applied Magnetics Corp. and Mentor Graphics Corp. declined more than 20%.    MERRILL LYNCH: Gains in pollutioncontrol issues were overshadowed last quarter by losses in such stocks as Genentech Inc., down 39%, Telxon Corp., down 29%, and Interspec Inc., down 27%. The poor quarter pulled Merrill down to eighth in the long-term ranking. The firm has no recommended list; the study tracks the picks of its individual analysts. Andrew Melnick, director of research, says those picks don't always fit the firm's strategycurrently, to buy bonds and interest-sensitive stocks such as utilities. Utilities, he says, don't qualify for analysts' top ratings because they don't have rapid earnings growth.    KIDDER PEABODY: &quot;We have been backpedaling in the {high-technology} area for some time,&quot; says R. Joseph Fuchs, director of research at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. That helped the firm, 80%-owned by General Electric Co., advance to sixth place in the long-term standings. Believing that interest rates are &quot;in the process of topping,&quot; Kidder currently recommends banks, savings and loans, and diversified financial service companies. It also likes &quot;financially strong, consistent growth companies,&quot; such as Waste Management Inc., Federal Express Corp. and Anheuser-Busch Inc. Generally, it favors large-company stocks (median market value: $5.4 billion, highest of the 10 firms).    DREXEL BURNHAM: The Priority Selection List at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is also geared toward big-company stocks. For the latest quarter, Drexel just about matched the market averages. Longer-term, it trails them, ranking ninth for both 12 months and 27 months. Arthur Kirsch, director of research, says he thinks the recent results indicate progress. He's following &quot;a more active trading strategy&quot; these days, he says, taking profits sooner in winners such as Marriott Corp. and Coca-Cola. However, losing stocks such as Motorola, down 22% in the third quarter, and Texas Instruments Inc., down 15%, have roughly canceled out the winners.    THOMSON MCKINNON: Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. publishes four recommended lists, for investors with varying goals. It's judged on its Long Term investment list, composed mostly of traditional high-quality growth stocks. That list shone in 1986 and 1987, but this year has lagged behind the market. Harry Zisson, director of research, notes ruefully that the list has &quot;broad exposure to the high-tech area,&quot; with stocks such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Automatic Data Processing Inc. and NCR Corp. He says that some big losers, such as Digital Equipment Corp., down 45% in 12 months, and McGraw-Hill Inc., down 30%, produced good profits for investors who bought them early enough.    ---   How the Big Brokerage Houses' Favorite Stocks Performed   Estimated performance of stocks recommended by major securities firms in periods ended Sept. 30, 1988, ranked on the basis of performance in the most recent 12 months.
