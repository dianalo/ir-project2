Clark, a lawyer accused in a stock scheme involving former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans.    A trial on 17 remaining embezzlement, perjury and tax evasion counts will proceed Oct. 5. The judge's permanent order, which was signed yesterday, had been expected.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani's office had said it wanted the insider counts dismissed so it could proceed with a trial without waiting for the Supreme Court's expected decision next year on Mr. Winans's appeal. The Clark dismissal &quot;does not constitute in any way a prediction or view as to how the Supreme Court will rule&quot; in the Winans case, Mr. Giuliani's office said in its Sept. 16 dismissal request. </TEXT></DOC>
