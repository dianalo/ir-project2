Ronald Dellums,D-Calif., a member of the House Armed Services Committee and alongtime opponent of military buildup.   Although both proponents and opponents criticized the defensebill _ a compromise package worked out by House and Senateconferees after nearly two months of contentious negotiations _ theHouse on Thursday adopted the legislation, 236-172.   The bill, which goes to the Senate, slashes $1.1 billion fromPresident Bush's request for the Strategic Defense Initiative butprovides much of the money for two land-based nuclear missiles andthe B-2 stealth bomber.   The legislation also continues two programs Bush sought to kill_ the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter and the AHIP helicopter _ forone more year, and postpones a decision on the Marine Corps' V-22Osprey and the Phoenix missile.   The Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like ahelicopter but can fly like a plane, will receive about $255million in research and development money in fiscal 1990 but nofunds for procurement.   The legislation includes money for 18 F-14D jet fighters butrequires the manufacturer, Grumman Corp., to sign a terminationagreement ending all future production.   Salvaging weapons programs _ and jobs in many districts _ drewthe ire of a number of lawmakers.   ``The defense pork bill passed the Congress today. Congress madeno hard choices,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member of theHouse Armed Services Committee. ``The relationship between nationalsecurity and the defense authorization bill is just aboutcoincidental.''   The complaints came as East Germany opened the Berlin Wall andits other borders Thursday and allowed citizens to cross freely tothe West for the first time in 28 years.   ``Peace is breaking out and we're going to have four legs of thetriad instead of three,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., amember of the Armed Services panel.   Another committee member, Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said, ``Thewinds of change are sweeping across every part of our world. Wehave an opportunity to set a course to take this nation forward.''   Instead, Hopkins said, Congress was ``corrupted by parochialavarice.''   The defense budget, according to Dellums, ``continues to pursuethe same tired old path of no change, military expansion, more andmore brand-new conventional and nuclear weapons systems at a timewhen the world is crying out for change and the world is crying outfor peace.''   Among the legislation's provisions are $4.3 billion for the B-2,$430 million less than the administration requested for the fiscalyear that began Oct. 1. The bill provides money for two bombers infiscal 1990, one less than the administration sought. However, thelegislation accepts Bush's proposal for components for five bombersin fiscal 1991.   The bill provides $3.8 billion for SDI _ also known as Star Wars_ about $279 million less than was spent in fiscal 1989 and thefirst decrease since President Reagan proposed the anti-missileshield six years ago. Bush had sought $4.9 billion for the program.   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for two land-basednuclear missiles: the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX and thesingle-warhead, truck-based Midgetman. The bill trims about $150million from the administration's request for the two weapons andadds House language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX.   Also Thursday, House and Senate negotiators reached agreement ona $288 billion military spending bill for fiscal 1990 that largelytracks the defense authorization bill on the major strategicweapons, said lawmakers and congressional sources, who requestedanonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
