Different rules and definitions of illegal dealing is hinderingcontrol of unscrupulous trading practices in the increasinglyborderless equity markets worldwide, the chief of the leading U.S.exchange told reporters.   ``Everybody comes from different culture and corporatebackground. But the users of those markets have to see thosemarkets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work inthem,'' Phelan said at the Foreign Correspondent Club of Japan.   He urged each market to spell out its definition of insidertrading, then work together to set up common rules.   ``Within the market place, everybody talks the same language.But if it is perceived by any major participant that the market isunfair, there will be a lack of use of the market and that will bedetrimental to everybody.''   Phelan criticized the Japanese approach as ``a narrowinterpretation,'' but he declined to assess recent measures byJapanese securities authorities. ``Their needs are different fromour needs,'' he said.   Several cases of what Western finance experts charge are insidertrading deals _ buying and selling securities based on informationnot available to all _ are raising questions in Japan's financialcommunity about the ethics of Japanese stock deals.   In the most prominent case, several politicians' aides andsenior journalists admitted buying stock of a real estate concernbefore the issues were made public, and making huge profits byselling the shares after they were listed.</TEXT></DOC>
