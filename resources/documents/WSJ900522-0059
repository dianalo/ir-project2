The scientists tending Fast Critical Assembly No. 2, atthis laboratory a few hours from Moscow, are experimenting tofind a safer, more-efficient way to arrange uranium fuelinside a commercial nuclear-power reactor. Soon they'll starttests on a really wild notion hatched in Moscow: a reactorbathed in molten lead.</LP><TEXT>   Will it work? &quot;God knows]&quot; laughs one laboratory engineer.   The folks who brought you Chernobyl have a new mission: Toinvent an ultrasafe nuclear power reactor. In laboratorieslike this around the Soviet Union, scientists areexperimenting with a slew of possible new approaches tonuclear safety. In the aftermath of the disastrous 1986Chernobyl accident, many Soviet officials feel the only wayto repair the nuclear industry's tattered image is to leapbeyond existing technology and invent reactors that are saferthan Western models.   &quot;We need new thinking, new reactors and new philosophies,&quot;says Prof. Igor Slesarev, an official of Moscow's I.V.Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy.   Early results from this scientific brainstorming intrigueWestern physicists. &quot;There are some interesting ideas comingout of the Soviets,&quot; says Octave Du Temple, executivedirector of the American Nuclear Society, an association ofU.S. nuclear engineers and officials. Washington hasn't yetresponded to Soviet proposals to collaborate on suchresearch, but the two countries' scientists are exchanginginformation informally. &quot;We've had more (nuclear) discussionswith the Soviets in the past two years than in the previous30,&quot; says Mr. Du Temple.   There's more than scientific curiosity at stake. Aworld-wide search is under way for reactor designs that avoidsafety flaws such as those behind the world's three worstnuclear accidents: at Britain's Windscale reactor in 1957; atThree Mile Island in the U.S. in 1979; and at Chernobyl in1986. Based on that not-so-fail-safe history, nuclear foescontend that a truly safe reactor is impossible. Butatomic-industry supporters say improved safety could makenuclear power an alternative to the oil and coal plants whoseemissions are implicated in theories of global warming.   Though serious safety flaws remain in the construction andoperation of Soviet reactors, basic nuclear science has longbeen one of Moscow's few technological strong points, partlybecause of its kinship to nuclear-weapons research. Sovietsuccesses have included the first nuclear reactor in Europe(the U.S. was first in the world); the first reactor designedto produce electricity; and the first &quot;tokamak,&quot; a machineused in studies of nuclear fusion.   Now, Soviet officials say they aim to design reactors atleast 100 times safer than today's, implying there would be aone-in-10-million chance of an accident that spewed radiationoutside the plant, as happened at Chernobyl. Such a goal mayrequire abandoning much of the reactor technology of bothEast and West.   The problem, according to the Soviet analysis, is thatreactor safety today relies too much on fallible humanoperators and complex safety equipment, and not enough onmaking the reactor's basic design accident-proof. Mostreactors in East and West are just bundles of hot uraniumfuel cooled by water; the resulting steam turns a standardelectricity-making turbine. The Chernobyl accident stemmedfrom a flawed design that, with operator mistakes, let thereactor run out of control. At Three Mile Island, operatormistakes let the coolant water drain and the reactoroverheat.   One solution under study in Moscow entails buildingreactors underground, possibly in natural, watertight rockformations. There, the effects of any accident and ofradiation leakage would be minimized. And a buried reactorwould be sheltered from such hazards as plane crashes andearthquakes. U.S. engineers rejected a similar idea as toocostly years ago; but Soviet scientists, drawing onconstruction techniques developed in Soviet mining, think theexpenses may be exaggerated.   A more-radical safety approach would use molten lead as areactor coolant. The idea isn't as far out as it might seem:Already, in a few so-called &quot;fast&quot; reactors in the SovietUnion, the U.S. and France, molten sodium metal is used as acoolant. It works because the metal, though hot, is stillcooler than the reactor core. But it has a big problem of itsown: Sodium reacts violently with water or air. Sodium leakshave already caused small explosions at Soviet and Frenchfast reactors.   Lead would be safer, Soviet scientists argue. It doesn'treact violently. And it would be unlikely to leak out andallow reactor overheating, says Prof. Victor Orlov, deputydirector of Moscow's Research and Development Institute ofPower Engineering. Any leak would quickly plug itself as theescaping lead cooled and solidified, he says. Moscow alreadypowers some of its submarines with reactors cooled by amixture of molten lead and bismuth. Western nuclear subs arewater-cooled.   There are drawbacks: Without safeguards, the hot leadcould gradually corrode its steel piping, or poison reactorworkers. But the idea intrigues U.S. engineers enough toconsider accepting a Soviet offer of collaboration. The leadidea &quot;certainly is credible,&quot; says James Laidler, engineeringresearch director at Argonne National Laboratory, a majorU.S. Energy Department laboratory.   Despite the Soviet public's post-Chernobyl distaste fornuclear power, Moscow already has about 150 scientists andengineers studying the concept. After Chernobyl, &quot;We havevery strong opposition to construction of a nuclear reactor.We have no opposition to research on it,&quot; says MikhailTroyanov, director of the Obninsk research center.</TEXT></DOC>
