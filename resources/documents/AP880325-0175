(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Allowing surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould to continue visiting Baby M will hurt the childpsychologically, the toddler's father argued in court papersreleased Friday.   William Stern, who won custody of the baby in a landmark stateSupreme Court ruling Feb. 3, asked a Superior Court judge todiscontinue visitation. Stern's attorney said he will call expertwitnesses to show that halting visitation would be in the bestinterest of the child, now legally known as Melissa Stern.   ``Testimony will again reconfirm ... that visitation at thisparticular point could only have a destabilizing influence on thechild and result in very grave consequences on her future mentalhealth,'' attorney Gary Skoloff said in court papers.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has asked that she be allowed to spend moretime with the baby, with the meetings expanded eventually to halfthe summer and some holidays.   She has been allowed to see Melissa once a week, for two hours,under supervision. Court papers released Thursday by Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's attorneys call that schedule ``insufficient.''   She contends that the child would be harmed if those visitationswere discontinued.   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationshipwith Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishingand productive relationship,'' said court papers filed by Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold Cassidy.   The documents, filed earlier this week, give an indication whatboth sides will argue when Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween onMonday convenes a visitation hearing that may be the final legalskirmish in the fierce battle over the child, who turns 2 Sunday.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's $10,000 contract with Stern became ahighly publicized court case after she refused to turn over thechild she agreed to bear. Since the case began, Mrs.Whitehead-Gould divorced her first husband, Richard Whitehead, andmarried a Wall Street broker, Dean Gould.</TEXT></DOC>
