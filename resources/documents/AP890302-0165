W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, also said that ifEastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket therailroad, Amtrak would add trains between New York and Washingtonand possibly between New York and Boston.   Claytor told the Senate transportation appropriationssubcommittee that based on public statements by union leaders, heconsidered it likely that a strike against Eastern would result inpicketing against the railroad by union members seeking to disrupttransportation.   Outside the hearing room, he told reporters that managementpersonnel would operate the trains, and that Amtrak would be able toprovide limited service on its routes ``for at least a day or two,and then shut down altogether.''   He said the railroad could not function for much longer becauseof rules regulating the number of hours railway employees can work.

The ministers agreed to cut chlorofluorocarbon production by 85percent as soon as possible and to seek a total ban on the syntheticsubstances by the end of the century.   Chlorofluorocarbons are used in aerosal sprays, refrigerationcoolants and a variety of other products. The compounds are blamedfor depletion of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from thesun's harmful ultraviolet rays.   The ministers agreed to give the EEC Commission a mandate tocompletely phase out the manufacture and use of chlorofluorocarbonsby the year 2000.   The commission will represent the 12 nations at the internationalconferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue andmonitor application of an international accord called the MontrealProtocol.   This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, tookeffect on Jan. 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use ofchlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998.   The EEC ministers also gave a mandate to the commission toencourage other countries to sign and ratify the protocol.   The EEC member states are responsible for about half the world'sannual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons, with Britainleading in both production and exports, according to theLondon-based environmental group Greenpeace.   Greenpeace says Britain exported chlorofluorocarbons to 117countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signed the Montreal Protocol.   Greenpeace said that ``between 1979 and 1986 the ozone layer overthe EEC has already been depleted by an average of 3 percent. Thisrises to nearly 7 percent in the winter.''   Ministers from countries which have ratified the MontrealProtocol are to meet in London March 5-7 and a further conference isscheduled in Helskinki, Finland, on May 2-5 to monitor theapplication of the protocol.</TEXT></DOC>
