Either the large-scale energy resource extraction and convertionprojects, or the small-scale but extended exploitation of renewable energy,generate multiple effects on the economic characteristics of affectedregions. The objective of this paper is to describe a linked modelingsystem developed and elaborated for the analysis of regional energy andeconomy interactions. The work presented aims to demonstrate feasibilityof the paradigm: that the design and construction of alternative scenarioson the basis of a system of linked energy - economy models enhances significantlythe evaluation of alternative strategies. Furthermore, the paper presentsa rigid and robust linkage between various regional economic and energymodels and establishes the whole system in a user-friendly simulationenvironment.</TEXT></DOC>
