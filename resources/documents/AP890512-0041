Vindictive'</HEAD><HEAD>Laserphoto WX10</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Secord, the retired officer who ranarms to the Nicaraguan Contras, lied to Congress in his testimonyon the Iran-Contra scandal and covered up more than $1 million inpersonal profits, a second indictment against him alleges.   Secord, enlisted by Oliver North in the Contra arms supplynetwork, said the nine-count indictment unsealed Thursday shows theweakness of the government's original case and is ``a senselessattempt to secure a conviction.''   The retired Air Force major general was originally indicted onsix criminal charges in March 1988.   ``The decision to indict again is vindictive and contrary to anynotion of fair play and professionalism,'' Secord's lawyers said ina statement. The three-page statement, issued by the Washington lawfirm of Sharp, Green andamp; Lankford, also asked for financialassistance from the public to help pay for Secord's defense.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh ``has seen his so-called`conspiracy case' eviscerated by court rulings and most recently bya jury's verdict,'' said Secord's lawyers.   North, who was indicted with Secord in March 1988, was convictedlast week of three of 12 criminal charges against him. Conspiracyand theft counts against the former White House aide were droppedJan. 13 due to national security concerns.   The new indictment against Secord was returned April 7 by afederal grand jury investigating possible perjury by Iran-Contrafigures. It was kept sealed to avoid bringing it out during North'strial.   Secord was the lead witness in the televised hearings conductedin the spring and summer of 1987 by the House and Senatecommittees. He testified without immunity from prosecution beforethe congressional panels.   The new charges include seven counts of perjury in connectionwith his congressional testimony to Congress and one count ofobstructing Congress' ran-Contra committees. Secord also is accusedof making false statements to congressional staffers about a$200,000 educational benefit for North's children and a $13,800security system Secord paid for at North's home.   Secord faces a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment and$250,000 in fines on each count if convicted.   The false statement charge accuses Secord, 56, of denying tolawyers for the congressional Iran-Contra panels that he was awareof any money from the Iran-Contra transactions that went to benefitNorth.   The indictment alleges that Secord used former Internal RevenueService lawyer Willard Zucker, who was granted immunity fromprosecution and testified at North's recent trial, to hide largesums that he diverted to his personal use.   The money came from more than $47 million that Zucker, based inSwitzerland, moved through Swiss bank accounts for Secord andbusiness partner Albert Hakim, the indictment said. The accountswere part of an enterprise made up of a clandestine network offoreign corporations, the indictment said.   Secord lied to Congress by saying that his only profits fromarms sales to the Contras and Iran came from his $6,000 monthlysalary, the government alleged.   Zucker testified at the North trial that in 1986, $28.6 millionwas funneled through Swiss bank accounts used in the Iran-Contraaffair by Secord and Hakim. One $9,000 draft, testified Zucker, waspartial payment for North's security system. North was convicted ofaccepting an illegal gratuity from Secord in connection with thesystem.   Zucker wasn't permitted to testify in detail at North's trialabout the $200,000 death benefit for North's children because Northwasn't tried on that matter. But prosecutors said Zucker would havetestified that he set aside $200,000 and that the money is now inan account earning interest.   Secord was indicted in March 1988 along with North, Hakim andNorth's ex-boss, former national security adviser John Poindexter.The heart of that indictment was that the four men conspired toillegally divert profits from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.   Other charges against Secord in the original indictment aretheft of government property, wire fraud, conspiracy to pay illegalgratuities, the offer of an illegal gratuity and payment of anillegal gratuity. The gratuities charges involve the securitysystem and the death benefit.   In a separate legal matter, Secord was convicted in the FairfaxCounty, Va., General District Court of drunken driving. Theprosecution said Secord's blood alcohol level was 0.20, twice thelegal limit, when he was arrested Feb. 26. He was fined $200 andordered to enter an alcohol safety program.   Secord's lawyer said an appeal was planned.</TEXT></DOC>
