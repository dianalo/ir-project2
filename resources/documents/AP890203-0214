Big depositors, worried that the long-troubled institution was onthe verge of toppling, sent wire orders yanking out nearly half abillion dollars in the first two months of 1988 alone.   Regulators ended the nightmare with a few soothing words. Theywaved a magic wand called deposit insurance.   The episode symbolizes both the great strength and the underlyingweakness of the U.S. system of insuring bank and Sandamp;L deposits, asystem created half a century ago as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt'sNew Deal.   Bank run. The very words make financial regulators queasy andevoke Depression-era memories of long lines of depositors anxiouslyclutching savings passbooks.   But the run at American Savings and Loan was straight from thehigh-tech '80s. There were no mobs pressing at the institution'sdoors; only clacking computer terminal keys and whirring magneticdiscs as money brokers withdrew their wealthy clients' cash.   Officials at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the agency thatregulates nearly 3,000 federally insured Sandamp;Ls, stopped the run inmid-March with the simple announcement that they would protect alldepositors, even those with accounts exceeding the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp.'s $100,000 limit.   Ironically, the deposit insurance that saved the California Sandamp;Lalso helped create the industry's mess. The insurance allows savingsand loan owners to put up a little of their own money, take in a lotof deposits and gamble on risky loans, potentially at the taxpayers'expense.   That's what occurred with American Savings and Loan. Once aconservative mortgage lender, new management took over in 1983 andembarked on a program of rapid growth and aggressive real estatelending. Bad loans grew and last December the FSLIC had to pay $1.7billion to have the institution taken over by a new owner.   If deposit insurance is part of the problem, it has also been asource of security for millions and the only thing that has stavedoff disaster for people who found that the repositories of theirlife savings had gone under.   `People have an almost mystical degree of confidence in thefederal sticker on the wall,'' says Robert Litan, a banking expertat the Brookings Institution, a liberal Washington think tank.   ``Even though the FSLIC is insolvent, they believe the governmentcan come up with the money somehow. George Bush just told themthat.''   One week into his term, Bush made a point in his nationallytelevised news conference of reassuring Sandamp;L customers. Deposits inthe nation's Sandamp;Ls ``are sound, they are good ... nothing is going tochange in that regard,'' the president said.   How, then, did a once sleepy, seemingly secure industry come tothe point that it needed presidential pronouncements to steady itscustomers' nerves? How did it sink so low that regulators wouldpledge $31 billion to rescue 205 institutions in 1988 and still have350 insolvent, but still open, institutions to babysit?   The seeds of the ailment have been buried deep within from thestart. They lay in the inherent instability of borrowing short (fromdepositors) and lending long (to home buyers for 20 or 30 years).   That was fine during the long economic boom and stable interestrates that followed World War II. Sandamp;L executives lived by the 3-6-3rule: Take in deposits at 3 percent interest, lend the money to homebuyers at 6 percent and hit the golf course by 3 p.m.   By the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the industry'sunderpinnings had become wobbly. Inflation was soaring into doubledigits and the Federal Reserve Board responded by pushing interestrates past 20 percent. Money poured out of the thrifts, with theirlow interest rates, and into high-yield money market mutual fundsoffered by brokerage firms.   By 1980, Congress felt it had little choice but to lift the 5.5percent cap on interest paid to Sandamp;L depositors or watch thriftinstitutions shrivel. At the same time, the limit on federalinsurance was raised from $40,000 to $100,000 per account.   Then, two year later, new laws gave thrift owners freshinvestment opportunities: commercial and consumer loans,construction lending and direct investments in development projects.   The idea was that diversification would give Sandamp;Ls a chance toenter more lucrative fields and grow less dependent on the rollercoaster housing market.   Regulators also lifted rules limiting brokered deposits to 5percent of the total. Brokers divy up the money of wealthy clientsand institutions into $100,000 chunks, parceling them out toinstitutions paying the highest rates.   Some thrifts thrived in the new climate, but many didn't have theexperience to succeed and saw their portfolios grow ever more shaky.   Even more bedeviling were laws lying dormant in states such asTexas, California and Florida giving thrifts power to make riskyinvestments. As long as the federal interest rate cap and the limiton brokered deposits remained in place, institutions couldn'tattract enough deposits to get into risky areas in a big way.   After 1982, that changed. Enter a new breed of player: the highflier.   Men like Don Dixon and Ed McBirney, who purchased small, staidinstitutions such as Dixon's Vernon Savings and Loan and McBirney'sSunbelt Savings, both in Texas and both later bailed out forbillions of dollars. These new owners opened up the phone lines,scooped up brokered deposits and shoveled the money into riskyconstruction and development projects.   Along the way they lived well and made powerful political friendssuch as House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. McBirney threw lavishparties at his North Dallas home, serving exotic game and dressingservants in costume. He flew important customers on a Las Vegasjunket in a borrowed jet.   Dixon lent his yacht, High Spirits, to California Rep. TonyCoehlo, chief of the Democrats' congressional campaign committee,for lucrative Democratic fund-raisers.   The party lasted until 1986, when oil prices collapsed. AcrossTexas, real estate projects begun on projections of $70-a-barrel oilfell apart. Borrowers defaulted but the collateral they turned overwas now worth only a fraction of what they owed. Regulators estimatethat about half of the nation's Sandamp;L problem is centered in Texas andother oil states.   As the comptroller of the currency, Robert Clarke, says of bankfailures, ``When the economic tide goes out, you find out who isswimming naked.''   And while more and more Sandamp;Ls were becoming financially shaky, thegovernment had fewer cops _ Sandamp;L examiners _ on the beat.   The Reagan administration's budget office rebuffed Edwin Gray,then chairman of the bank board, when he pleaded for money to hiremore and better-qualified examiners.   In 1985, he did some administrative maneuvering, freeing theexamination force from White House budget controls. He raisedexaminers' salaries and by last year the force had doubled.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
