 Newfeatures have been added to this reduced memory version: A practical workloadconsisting of one MS-DOS application and up to two OS/2 applications will nowrun in 2Mb of memory in OS/2 1.3.andP;  With OS/2 Extended Edition 1.3, users cannow run these applications along with components, such as LAN Requester, in3Mb of memory.andP;  IBM says local area network programs may now be loaded up tothree times faster than OS/2 Version 1.2 for most users.andP;  As a result ofIBM's decision last spring to implement Adobe font technology across SystemsApplication Architecture OS/2 1.3 now includes the Adobe Type Manager.andP;  Thetype now looks the same on a display as it does when printed.andP;  Also includedin this version is an open font interface.andP;  Enhanced device drivers provide avariety of support for printers, such as the IBM LaserPrinter series,Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series, Epson and PostScript printers.andP;  The additionof a new Print Manager simplifies the installation of many of these printersand printer device drivers.andP;  Further, the interface to a new Print Spoolersimplifies printing over a LAN.andP;  OS/2 Extended 1.3 and LAN Server 1.3 includenew features: The Communications Manager component of OS/2 Extended 1.3 nowenables Asynchronous Communications Device Interface calls to be redirectedover the local net.andP;  This enables workstations attached to a local areanetwork to share the modem and line pooling facilities of a server.andP;  Supportfor Ethernet has been expanded in OS/2 Extended 1.3 and OS/2 LAN Server 1.3for both MS-DOS and OS/2 workstations.andP;  In addition, OS/2 LAN Server providesan MS-DOS LAN Requester that now supports Windows 3.0.andP;  OS/2 Standard 1.3costs $340 to license, a licence for OS/2 Extended 1.3 costs $830 - bothversions are available by year end, while an OS/2 LAN Server 1.3 licence willcost $1,040 in March when it ships.andP;  Users of OS/2 Standard or Extended 1.1or 1.2, and of OS/2 LAN Server 1.0 or 1.2 get free upgrades up to 120 daysfrom release.andM;The P75 luggable, weighing 21 lbs, is aptly described as a 3090 withhandleFor some reason IBM chose to announce its 80486 luggable in Europe only- the P75 486 weigh-ing in at 21 lbs, comes in two versions: the Model 161has a 160Mb SCSI fixed disk, while Model 401 has a 400Mb SCSI fixed diskdrive, and both sport a 33MHz 80486 processor.andP;  They have a plasma screenwith Extended Graphics Array functionality and four internal expansion slots.andO;They both support the PS/2 Wizard Adaptor which, via the 80860 RISCprocessor, means they can offer 27 MIPS.andP;  No pricing.andM;PS/2s galore: three new Model 80s and one new Model 65 SX are launchedIBMalso expanded the PS/2 Model 80 and Model 65 SX families to include four newsystems that deliver one-third more fixed-disk storage and 30% more infixed-disk performance.andP;  The four systems are: the PS/2 Model 80-A16, a 25MHzsystem with a 160Mb SCSI fixed disk; the Model 80-161, a 20MHz system with a160Mb SCSI fixed disk; the Model 80-081, a 20MHz system with an 80Mb SCSIfixed disk; and the Model 65 SX-321, a 320Mb version of the 16 MHz, 80386SXentry-level file server.andP;  Also available as options for all floor-standingMicro Channel PS/2s, the 80Mb and 160Mb fixed disks announced today have anaccess speed of 17mS and 16mS, respectively; the 320Mb fixed disk offers anaccess speed of 12.5mS.andP;  The new systems and disk drives are supported byMS-DOS 3.3 or higher and OS/2 1.2 or higher.andP;  The Model 80-081 costs $6,845,the 80-161 costs $7,495, the 80-A16 costs $10,195, the 65 SX costs $7,945.andM;PS/2 Model 70s, 80-A21 price cutsSystem price reductions range from 8% to 25%and affect the 25MHz PS/2 Model 70s as well as the PS/2 Model 80-A21.andP;  Theprice of the 486/25 Power Platform was reduced to $1,900 from $4,000; variousPS/2 memory options were reduced by up to 50%.andM;SCSI tower offers up to 2.2Gb storageandM;The IBM PS/2 External Storage Enclosure for SCSI Devices houses up to sevenstorage devices, such as fixed disks, CD-ROM drives or tape-backup units, andattaches them to any Micro Channel PS/2 with a SCSI adaptor through a singleexpansion slot.andP;  The new floor-standing storage tower comes standard with asingle IBM PS/2 320Mb SCSI Fixed Disk Drive and can take up to 2.24Gb of IBMstorage options.andP;  The expansion tower is attached to Micro Channel PS/2sthrough either the PS/2 Micro Channel SCSI Adaptor with Cache, standard onthe Model 95 and Model 90, or the PS/2 Micro Channel SCSI Adaptor, which isstandard on all Model 80s and Model 65 SXs.andP;  Both SCSI adaptors are availableas options for all existing Micro Channel PS/2s.andP;  The PS/2 External StorageEnclosure for SCSI Devices with a single 320Mb SCSI Fixed Disk is priced at$6,500.andP;  IBM also introduced the PS/2 2.3Gb SCSI Tape Drive, a 5.25&quot; tapeback-up device that can store up to 2.3Gb of information.andP;  Designed for usewith either PS/2 Model 95 or the PS/2 External Storage Enclosure for SCSIDevices, the tape drive is supported by Sytos Plus/IBM File Backup Utilities,OS/2 1.2 and above, MS-DOS 3.3 and up.andP;  Ships now at $6,550.andM;Multimedia touchscreens, video cardandM;IBM also announced enhancements to its multimedia offerings that, forexample, enable users of the Audio Visual Connection software to createfull-motion video presentations on the PS/2.andP;  The new Audio Visual Connection1.03 now provides touchscreen capabilities for ease of use in creating andviewing multimedia presentations in all media forms.andP;  IBM also announcedenhancements to its M-Control Program - the software which enablesfull-motion video presentations using IBM's full-motion video card M-MotionVideo Adaptor/A.andP;  M-Control Program/2 now supports Microsoft Windows 3.0, andimproves the speed of performance in Presentation Manager.andP;  Audio VisualControl 1.03 is further enhanced through a new video out option, whichenables the user to send draft or finished presentations to a video cassetterecorder or television monitor for video playback.andP;  Other improvementsinclude: higher fidelity sound and the ability to play Musical InstrumentDigital Interface files.andP;  Audio Visual Control 1.03 is available immediatelyand sells for $544.andP;  M-Control Program/2 ispriced at $150 and will beavailable in January 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
