By monitoringthe changes in the Si 2p core-level and Ag 4d valence-band line shapes,we have examined the chemical interaction between the Ag adatoms andSi surface dimer atoms. The Ag-to-Si bonding coordination number as afunction of coverage was obtained. This number is 2 at low Ag coverages,which suggests that the bonding site for a Ag adatom is between two neighboringSi surface dimers along the direction of dimerization; the two dimerdangling bonds pointing at the Ag adatom join the two Ag sp hybrid orbitalsto form two Ag-Si bonds. The growth mode was observed to be three dimensionalat higher coverages. The Schottky-barrier height was measured.</TEXT></DOC>
