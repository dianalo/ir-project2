Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. sweetened its hostile tender offer for Sterling Drug Inc. to $4.33 billion, or $76 a share, after Sterling's board rejected its previous offer of $4.2 billion, or $72 a share.    Hoffmann-La Roche's move followed Sterling's disclosure that it has entered into talks with third parties, which weren't identified, about a possible sale of the drug concern. Sources close to Sterling, however, said the company is likely to seek a friendly merger partner only as a last resort. A Sterling spokesman declined comment on Hoffmann-La Roche's sweetened bid.    Yesterday, Sterling's stock surged $3.25 a share to $77.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on news that the company rejected Hoffmann-La Roche's $72-a-share bid and was in talks with potential acquirers.    Volume was heavy, as 1.2 million shares changed hands, and some arbitragers predicted a bidding war would erupt for the company. Hoffmann-La Roche announced its sweetened bid last night after the close of trading.    By quickly boosting its bid, the Swiss pharmaceutical concern hopes to underscore its resolve to take over Sterling and seeks to pre-empt any attempt by Sterling to seek a friendly merger partner. But the new $76-a-share offer remained below Sterling's stock price yesterday, and many analysts and takeover professionals believe the bidding may top $80 a share.    Fritz Gerber, Hoffmann-La Roche chairman, said: &quot;We continue to have great respect for Sterling's management and business and strongly believe that an agreed-upon combination will enhance Sterling's operations while serving the best interests of its shareholders.&quot;    Added an individual close to Hoffmann-La Roche: &quot;They're hoping we're going to go away and we're not. Reading between the lines, we think (Sterling's) announcement suggests weakness, and we are dealing from a position of strength. The clock is running.&quot; Hoffmann-La Roche's bid expires Feb. 2.    Individuals close to Sterling said the company's primary objective is remaining independent and predicted it would arrange a merger only if forced.    &quot;If the odds look really bad, and we can't remain independent, then we've got other options,&quot; including a friendly merger, said one individual close to Sterling. &quot;If we were going to (sell the company), we could have done it over the weekend with somebody else. The message is clearly that we want the shot to try and remain independent.&quot;    In a statement, Sterling hinted that it might drop the merger talks if Hoffmann-La Roche withdrew its bid.    &quot;The continuation or consummation of such discussions and negotiations with third parties may be dependent upon the future actions of Roche . . . and may be discontinued in the event that the Roche offer were to be withdrawn or were otherwise to be unsuccessful,&quot; the company said. So far, Sterling executives have refused to meet with Hoffmann-La Roche.    Sterling's announcement came after its board on Sunday rejected Hoffmann-La Roche's $72-a-share bid as &quot;grossly inadequate.&quot; In the statement, Sterling, the maker of such well-known consumer brands as Lysol disinfectant and Bayer aspirin, urged shareholders to reject the Swiss concern's bid.    &quot;In arriving at its decision, the board of directors gave careful consideration to a number of factors, including the opinion of Morgan Stanley, Sterling Drug's financial advisers, that the Roche offer is grossly inadequate,&quot; said John M. Pietruski, Sterling Drug's chairman and chief executive officer.    If Sterling is ultimately sold, takeover professionals and analysts say it could easily fetch a price of $80 a share or more. Ronald Nordmann, a PaineWebber Inc. drug analyst, puts the company's value at between $83 and $93 a share.    Privately, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which is screening potential suitors for Sterling, is said to be shunning any companies that, in one investment banker's words, &quot;aren't super-interested and flush with cash.&quot; Adds an individual close to Sterling: &quot;It only makes sense. We're going up against an all-cash bid. We've got to have apples against apples.&quot;    So far, none of the potential suitors have been identified. Names frequently mentioned include Nestle S.A., Bayer, Dow Chemical Co., Pfizer Inc. and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., a major Japanese drug concern that formed a Japanese joint venture with Sterling.    In its statement, Sterling also said it has explored &quot;alternative transactions&quot; that, Wall Street sources said, include the sale of certain assets, a recapitalization, a complete or partial liquidation and the sale of equity to a friendly buyer.    Mr. Pietruski also said Sterling intends to &quot;pursue vigorously&quot; a lawsuit filed last week against Hoffmann-La Roche that seeks to block the bid. A hearing on the suit is scheduled for Jan. 29. </TEXT></DOC>
