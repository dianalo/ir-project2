The steam-methane reforming processwas studied using this programme in an integral flow reactor over a nickelcatalyst at temperatures varying from 674 K to 1160 K, pressure rangingfrom 1.2 to 25.5 bar and S/C in the feed between 1.44 and 4.50. The reactorwas considered to be a fixed-bed model with axial pseudo-one dimensionaltemperature profile. The intrinsic rate equations for steam-methane reforming(RF) and shift (SF) reaction were determined. Assuming the competitiveproduction model of CO and CO/sup 2/, in the hybrid expression of theLangmuir-Hinshelwood expression and the power law expression, the followingvalues were derived for the activation energies (E) and the effectivenessfactors (eta); Esub(R) = 106.87 kJ/g-mol, Esub(S) = 54.531 kJ/g-mol,etasub(R), etasub(S) = 0.05 - 0.065. The apparent rate equations (NN)estimated without separating mass and heat transfer influences were alsoobtained. The relation of RF and SF rate constants in each case was determinedfor both the YY case and the NN case. In the design simulation the excessratio of the catalyst volume required with NN to that with YY increaseswith lower pressure, lower SVo, higher S/C and higher inlet temperatureunder the same heat flux profile.</TEXT></DOC>
