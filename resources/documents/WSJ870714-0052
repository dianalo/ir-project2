Foster Co. said it agreed in principle to sell its Architectural Hardware group to a company to be formed by Beacon Capital Corp., a closely held Canadian company.    Under the agreement, the Beacon concern will pay $75 million in cash and assume about $195 million of L.B. Foster's debt to acquire the unit, which makes doors and door hardware.    L.B. Foster said that financing for the acquisition has been arranged and that the transaction is expected to be completed by mid-August.    Jerry E. Goldress, L.B. Foster's chairman and chief executive officer, said the sale will enable the company to eliminate nearly all debt and to strengthen its distribution business in its core construction, rail and tubular product markets.    Beacon Capital, which has been in the health-care field for many years, recently has become active in leveraged-buyout acquisitions. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
