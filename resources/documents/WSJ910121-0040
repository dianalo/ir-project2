Advances would be fueled by end-of-war euphoria, and thesubsequent declines fostered by bearish supply-and-demandfactors. Currently, supplies are generally more than adequatebut demand is lackluster. A quick end to the war will refocusattention on weakening Western economies, some of which, likethe U.S., already are in recession.</LP><TEXT>   Some analysts think the strong moves in commodity pricesThursday could foreshadow what would happen if hostilitiesconclude quickly. Richard Dennis, a Chicago commodity trader,thinks the trends that began Thursday will be &quot;the wave ofthe future.&quot; He explains: &quot;The market was surprised&quot; by theearly success of the U.S.-led offensive against Iraq, &quot;and itwill take a long time for it to correct.&quot;   The chief industrial commodity is oil. While most analystsbelieve that a short war is bearish for oil prices, KenNugent, a San Francisco options trader for PaineWebber, isn'tso sure. &quot;The war could end in many ways and I am not sosanguine with some possible outcomes,&quot; he says. If fightingin Iraq and Kuwait ends but terrorist attacks in the MiddleEast and elsewhere continue, oil prices would be buoyed, hesaid, perhaps to a range of $25 to $42 a barrel.   His partner, Randall Thompkins, believes oil soared to $42a barrel in October strictly on fear that supplies would becurtailed. &quot;We have now replaced oil that was coming fromIraq and Kuwait barrel-for-barrel, mostly with oil from SaudiArabia,&quot; he notes, and those Saudi fields are no longerthreatened. &quot;Though (the Saudis) would like higher prices,they are comfortable with oil at around $20 in New York,&quot; hesays. February crude closed Friday at $19.25, down $2.19 abarrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   William O'Neill, senior futures analyst at Merrill LynchFutures in New York, says many commodity prices wouldstrengthen if the war is brief. &quot;The economy needs a positivejolt to boost consumer confidence and a short war wouldprovide it,&quot; he says. The war has made copper users cautiousin their purchases, giving rise to soft prices, he contends.He said the general consensus is that the U.S. recession willcontinue at least until the second half of the year, but ashort war could help to end it sooner.   Robin Bhar, metals analyst at Carr Kitcat andamp; Aitken inLondon, says business confidence would be charged up by arapid conclusion to the war. He foresees a quick run-up inthose metals used to make autos, housing, packaging anddurable and capital goods. Initial rallies would betemporary, he believes, but prices could strengthen long-termas the recession ends in the second half.   For silver, &quot;short war or long war, it doesn't make anydifference,&quot; asserts Philip Gotthelf, editor of CommodityFutures Forecast, a market newsletter. With surplusesabounding, &quot;silver isn't going anywhere in the immediatefuture.&quot; The metal's price has dropped 20% since the invasionof Kuwait because of weakening economies.   Platinum prices are now linked to gold, Mr. Gotthelf says.He thinks that if hostilities end soon platinum will declinewith gold. However, he adds, U.S. and European oil refineriesmight use slightly more platinum if Kuwait loses refiningcapacity in the war.   Most London analysts, where the base metals are traded,see the possibility of at least initially higher prices inthe event of a short war. That's partly because in the pastsix months or so lead has slumped 54%, nickel by 52%, zinc by33%, tin by 20% and both aluminum and copper by 31%.   &quot;These low metal prices reflect higher production andinventories,&quot; says Angus MacMillan, research head atBillitonEnthoven Metals Ltd., so declines would quicklyresume. He notes, for example, that copper stocks atexchanges in London and New York have soared to more than200,000 tons from 117,000 tons a year ago.   Each of the base metals will perform differently, saysHans Murmann, managing director of the MetallgesellschaftLtd., members of the London Metal Exchange, although all arelikely to rally if the conflict ends within a month. Morecopper production will be coming on stream this year, hesays, which will pressure its price; a decline in aluminumprices will lead producers to slash output; nickel willremain weak because the Soviet Union will increase its salesto raise hard currency; lead demand is falling because of thedownturn in the auto industry; tin is in surplus. Mr. Murmannsees higher prices only for zinc, which is in short supply inEurope because of production problems.   Lumber prices would hold up longer than the metals after ashort war, says Mr. Gotthelf. He reasons that with lower oilprices the Japanese would have more money to spend on U.S.lumber, which they buy in quantity. &quot;But a long war wouldintensify the Japanese and the U.S. recessions and would meanno buyers for lumber,&quot; he adds.   Even without a war, cotton prices have been strong. SharonJohnson, cotton analyst for Cargill Investor Services inAtlanta, says, &quot;A brief war will only add to the short-termbullish sentiment in cotton.&quot; She notes that with an end tohostilities, textile-producing countries will be able topurchase more cotton with money that otherwise might havebeen spent on oil.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Sugar                                                                                                          Futures prices set new lows last week on concerns the Gulfwar would interfere with shipments to Middle Easterncountries, which are among the biggest buyers in the worldmarket. March sugar fell 0.04 cent a pound Friday to 8.99cents.   If the war ends quickly, prices might rebound briefly,says Judith Ganes, a Merrill Lynch analyst. The longer thewar lasts, she adds, the more bearish the outlook.   Sugar shippers might be willing to hold supplies intendedfor Mideast buyers for a couple of weeks, says HarriSchwartz, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services. But ifthe conflict drags on for months, that sugar will end up backin the market, he says.   In that case, the expected sugar surplus this year woulddouble to two million tons, estimates Sandra Kaul, ShearsonLehman Brothers analyst. Curiously, that gloomy prospectdidn't prompt any follow-through selling last week, Ms. Kaulnotes. Perhaps, she says, traders sense something bullisharound the corner.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Futures prices dropped from a high of 91 cents a pound toa low of 85 cents a pound in the past week and a half asspeculators sold contracts apparently to build up cashreserves, says Ms. Kaul. Prices then recovered slightly,ending Friday at 87.75 cents a pound, down 0.25 cent.   The sell-off by speculators pushed futures to a discountbelow the cash price for physical coffee, Ms. Kaul says. Asthe recovery late last week showed, that kind of situationdoesn't last long because producers jump on the opportunityto buy the discounted contracts, she adds.   Ms. Ganes of Merrill Lynch notes, however, that as theprice approached 88 cents a pound, roasters' interest cooled.She says she expects the same type of activity this week,with coffee trading between 85 cents and 89 cents a pound.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders will be watching weather reports out of Brazilthis week to determine whether this large soybean producergets the rain its soybean crop desperately needs.Unseasonably dry weather in Brazil's largest growing regions-- the last strong rain was on Dec. 18 -- spurred a rally insoybean futures contracts late last week. Extended forecastsshowed a chance of rain in Brazil early in the week; if thisdoesn't materialize, soybean futures prices may climb higher.   Some analysts have already reduced their estimates of theBrazil soybean crop by 500,000 tons, or 18 million bushels,and plan to double their estimate of the crops lost to dryweather if the country doesn't get any rain next week.Traders also will be watching war news. An indication thatthe war is likely to last a long time would put downwardpressure on grain prices, says Daniel Basse, director ofmarket research for AgResource Co., Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
