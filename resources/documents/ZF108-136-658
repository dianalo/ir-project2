O'Connell, automation coordinator for theOffice of Classification Personnel System and Oversight Group in the Officeof Personnel Management.andP;  &quot;The technology will be available and make thisfeasible.&quot;andM;More functions inevitably will move out of the personnel office and into themanagers' offices as data analysis and information manipulation become alarger part of the personnel office employee's job, said Sally K. Marshall,director of the Office of Personnel at the General Services Administration.andM;At the Army, personnel officials are concentrating on local area networks totie personnel, finance, resource management and other management functionstogether in the next few years, said Raymond J. Sumser, director of civilianpersonnel for the Army.andM;He agreed that technology will change the managers' job.andP;  But &quot;it seems to methe underlying questions here are not the automation capabilities but theimpact of those capabilities,&quot; Sumser said.andM;As an example Sumser mentioned personnel folders.andP;  Why does any agency needthem?andP;  The technology exists to electronically store and retrieve them usinga centralized database.andP;  So wouldn't it be easier to simply have a singlegovernment database of employee records, which could be retrieved andtransferred from agency to agency as needed?andP;  he asked.andM;Managers will have available at their fingertips the information to do manyjobs now done by the personnel office, O'Connell said.andP;  Personnel officeswill be smaller and more centralized in the agencies with their chief workbeing professional information analyses, he said.andM;O'Connell said he envisions a system made of several smaller expert systemsthat will empower managers and make them less dependent on personnel officesfor making human resource management decisions.andM;But before the government can move toward this type of environment, O'Connellsaid improvements need to be made in classification standards.andM;&quot;Without more analyses of the classification process, automation solutionswill be expensive, incompatible between agencies and based on antiquatedrequirements,&quot; he said.andM;A recent report by the Merit Systems Protection agreed.andP;  The exstingclassifications are dated and ineffective, the board said in its report,OPM's Classification and Qualification Systems: A Renewed Emphasis, aChanging Perspective.andM;While praising recent OPM efforts on classifications, the report questionedthe agency's ability to achieve quick and significant improvements.andO;&quot;Classification standards are not as current as they should be (or as OPMsays it wants them to be), yet the resources being devoted to producingclassification standards are unlikely to ever achieve the currency which isbeing sought,&quot; the report said.andM;Handful of SystemsandM;While classifications improvements are essential, agencies already are movingtoward a handful of personnel systems.andP;  Most agencies, covering roughly 80percent of civilian federal employees, use an automated system developed bythe Air Force.andM;Most agencies use some form of the Air Force personnel system, Marshall said.andM;&quot;We are more alike than different, so steal an existing system and develop ontop of it,&quot; she said.andM;Agencies need to share and adapt personnel systems because if they do not,government will continue to waste money and resources on personnelautomation, she said.andM;&quot;The majority of systems available are adaptable to almost all our agenciesno matter how unique we think we are,&quot; Marshall said.andM;But the biggest hindrance to personnel automation is paper, people still wantit, she said.andM;&quot;We still have this hang-pu that electronic data is not as accurate -- it'sprobably more accurate -- than paper,&quot; Marshall said.andM;There is also the equipment factor.andP;  The employee needs in the personneloffice also are changing.andP;  They key role computers now play in personnelmeans the employees often need ADP or technical expertise, Marshall said.andO;Also, she said, &quot;the best and brightest expect certain systems andtechnologies to be available to them.&quot;andM;&quot;The work force of the future is going to expect us to supply them with thosetools, she said, or else the goverment will not be able to attract the mostqualified employees.andP;  In the future, the government personnel offices willneed operating personnel with programming and analytical skills instead ofdata collection and entry ability, she said.andM;In automating personnel offices, there needs toi be balanced oversight somanagement does not create artificial barriers to innovation but still keepsautomation projects from spinning out of control, Marshall said.andM;&quot;You have to provide the equipment and then get out of the way of people inthe program,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;But you cannot let the techies run rampant either.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
