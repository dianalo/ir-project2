The results from lowerdoses i.e. 2.5 and 5 Gy treated groups indicated that there is completeand early recovery. However, after 10 Gy exposure, the restoration isnot complete but the drug accelerates the regeneration process and attemptsto attain normal value in the crypts by the last interval.</TEXT></DOC>
