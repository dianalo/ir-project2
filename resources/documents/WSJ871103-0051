The offer was reduced to $18 a share, from $24 a share, because the investor group couldn't complete financing under the previous terms, the company said.    A spokesman for International King's Table said some equity investors and lenders wouldn't support the $24-a-share price after the stock market crash. &quot;The $18-a-share price somewhat corresponds to the fall in the market,&quot; he said.    The restaurant chain, based in Eugene, Ore., has about 2.9 million shares outstanding. At $18 a share, the transaction has a value of about $52.2 million, down about $17.4 million from the earlier offer. International King's said its investment banker, Boettcher andamp; Co., rendered an opinion that the new offer is fair to public shareholders under current market conditions.    The revised agreement is still subject to certain conditions, including the availability of the required debt and equity financing and public shareholder approval. </TEXT></DOC>
