The Fed, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects the intentof the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures'' and ``wastaken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates overthe discount rate.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reaganadministration officials were disappointed by the action.   It was the first change in the central bank's discount ratesince Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than twoyears.   The increase, effective immediately, set the discount rate,which is the fee the Fed charges to make loans to U.S. financialinstitutions, at its highest level since April 21, 1986, when itfell to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.   Analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the moneysupply this week, but few were expecting an increase in thediscount rate, which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take.   Most were expecting the Fed to push up the federal funds rate,the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, by aneighth or a quarter of a percentage point from its current 7.75percent.   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,Mass., consulting firm, said he had not expected a discount rateincrease from the Fed board, all appointees of President Reagan,until after the November elections. But, he said, the Fed acted nowrather than in the fall, when the GOP presidential campaign of VicePresident George Bush is in full swing.   ``I think the timing is very deliberate to do it before theRepublican convention. That's sort of the kick off for theRepublican political ampaign and raising the discount rate now maybe seen as better than interrupting the campaign,'' Wyss said.   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the White House was``naturally ... disappointed.'' But he also told reporters:   ``The Federal Reserve has had the task of trying to balance theresistance to inflationary pressures with maintenance of realgrowth in the economy. ... We believe the Federal Reserve has beendoing a good job of balancing these interests.''   The likely negative effects of the hike include pushing up thevalue of the dollar, which could slow the improvement of the U.S.trade deficit, Wyss said. The dollar has been appreciating againstforeign currencies since early this year and now stands at an18-month high against the West German mark. It was the previousfall in the value of the dollar that shrank the trade deficit.   Wyss also said that the increase now will likely make governmentborrowing this week more costly. The Treasury Department, in itsquarterly auctions, plans to sell $11 billion in 10-year notestoday and $11 billion in three-year notes on Wednesday.   Tuesday's discount rate increase marked the second under thereign of Alan Greenspan, who took over as Fed chairman a year ago.In September, the central bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to6 percent, the first increase in three years.   That move was also taken in response to inflationary fears, butwas later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to theOctober stock market crash.   After the crash, the Fed pumped liquidity into the bankingsystem. It loosened money supplies again in mid-winter, when risingbusiness inventories raised concern that the economy was softening.   Since then, however, government statistics have portrayed astrong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation.Tight labor markets in some areas of the country has been sparkingworry about inflationary increases in wages. Some economists saysteadily rising factory operating rates are likely to contribute torising prices for manufactured goods.   Last month, Greenspan said in congressional testimony that theFed ``at this juncture might be well advised to err more on theside of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.''   At that hearing, before the Senate Banking Committee on July 13,Greenspan had played down the prospect of an immediate increase inthe discount rate after he was asked if he were worried about thegrowing gap between the discount rate and the federal funds rate,which had been increased in a series of small steps since lateMarch.   Greenspan replied that ``current relationships aresatisfactory'' and noted that the spread had been greater in thepast.   Too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to misuse the``discount window'' by borrowing from the Fed and lending to otherbanks.   In its statement today, the Federal Reserve Board said itincreased the discount rate in response to requests from FederalReserve banks in Boston; New York; Philadelphia; Cleveland;Richmond, Va.; Atlanta; St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo., and SanFrancisco.   As inflationary concerns have mounted in financial markets,other interest rates, including mortgage rates, have beenincreasing. The prime rate, the rate charged by banks to their mostcreditworthy customers, was raised by most major banks on July 14from 9 percent to 9.5 percent, its highest since March 1986.   Wyss said a further increase in the prime rate could come thisweek.   Among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the Julyunemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows.In addition, the monthly trade deficits for April and May were thelowest in nearly three years.   Prior to September, the last increase in the discount rate hadcome April 6, 1984, when the rate was boosted from 8.5 percent to 9percent.   The rate was then cut seven successive times, with the lastreduction on Aug. 20, 1986, when it dropped from 6 percent to 5.5percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade.</TEXT></DOC>
