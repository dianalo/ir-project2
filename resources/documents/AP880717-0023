The Democratic Platform Committee released the Jacksoncampaign's minority report on 13 disputed issues Sunday, but saidcompromises still were possible to avert floor fights Tuesday.   Resolution of the lingering platform disputes must await asettlement of the larger differences between Jackson and thecertain nominee, Michael Dukakis.   Even then, Jackson made clear Sunday that he wants the Democratsto debate his bedrock issues, especially his call for higher taxeson the wealthy and corporations and a Pentagon freeze.   ``The fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberatedupon and decided by the convention,'' Jackson said on CBS-TV's``Face the Nation.''   ``Our minority planks are majority positions. For example, mostAmericans do not want any more taxes on the middle class and poorpeople, but corporations and the wealthy must pay their share,''Jackson said.   The Dukakis campaign has said repeatedly it will not acceptJackson's call for higher taxes, a five-year freeze on Pentagonspending, a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and supportof self-determination for the Palestinians.   The minority report carries the disclaimer: ``These minoritypositions are under discussion by the parties for possibleagreements on language that may lead to their inclusion in theplatform.''   Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, chairman of the platformcommittee, said Saturday night, ``It's really in the hands of thecampaigns now.''   Blanchard predicted in an interview that if Jackson does pressfloor fights on all 13 issues, ``he might win one or two.''   Some Jackson minority planks cover less thorny domestic issuesthat lend themselves more readily to compromise. These includedJackson's call for full funding of Head Start, pre-natal care andthe Women, Infants and Children program, doubling the educationbudget, and creation of a national health program.   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, told reporters theplatform negotiations suspended Tuesday ``are not moving forward.''   ``Until we have resolved the broader issues of the relationshipbetween Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis, more importantly therelationship between Democratic Party and its crucial progressivewing ... to pursue detailed discussions on the platform just don'tmake sense,'' said Brown.   Ann Lewis, a senior Jackson adviser, predicted that if the twocandidates come to terms, compromise language can be found for morethan half the disputed planks.   At a dinner for the Platform Committee hosted by Rep. BillRichardson of New Mexico on Saturday night, both Jackson andDukakis delegates seemed pleased with their handiwork.   Janice Thurmond, a Jackson delegate from Athens, Ga., said,``Jackson's going to have to send a cue as to what he would likehis representatives and delegates to do about the platform, andthat hasn't come down yet.''   Richardson, a co-chair of the platform committee, said, ``Ithink there may be a skirmish on the defense and the revenue issue,but once that chemistry returns between Dukakis and Jackson, then Ithink everything will work out.''   The platform writers were in a self-congratulatory mood.   ``Well, platform people, we did it, didn't we? Didn't we do agood job? It's probably the only platform in the history of Americathat just says, `Good morning, America, we love ya,''' said Rep.Louise Slaughter of Fairport, N.Y. ``We're right on the edge ofsomething absolutely wonderful.''   William Schneider, an American Enterprise Institute analyst,told the Democrats, ``Both the choice of Sen. (Lloyd) Bentsen andthe platform that you've written ... have a message to ReaganDemocrats. Those are Democrats who are not liberals. There are tensof millions of them.''   ``The message is, `Come home. There is no ideological test.We're not going to ask you complicated questions. We want yourvotes, your confidence. The only thing that we require is that youwant to change the direction of this country,''' said Schneider.   The majority platform report, hammered out last month inMackinac Island, Mich., and Denver, runs fewer than 4,500 words _ atenth the size of the turgid 1984 platform and the Democrats'shortest election blueprint since the 1930s.   Without mentioning Ronald Reagan or George Bush, it commits theparty ``to reverse seven years of `voodoo economics,' `trickledown' politics, fiscal irresponsibility, and economic violenceagainst poor and working people.'' It calls for ``more stabledefense budgets.''</TEXT></DOC>
