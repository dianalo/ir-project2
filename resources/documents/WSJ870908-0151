And this, the Constitution's Bicentennial year, is no exception.    The Reagan administration and other conservatives say the Miranda decision does hinder law enforcement. Attorney General Edwin Meese, who wants the high court to scrap the decision, has said it &quot;provides incentives for the suspects not to talk&quot; and &quot;only helps guilty defendants.&quot;    Moreover, Mr. Meese and others say Miranda's protection for suspects goes well beyond what the framers of the Bill of Rights intended. &quot;We managed very well in this country for 175 years without it,&quot; Mr. Meese has said -- a view that leaves some constitutional experts flabbergasted. &quot;He knows nothing about the history of criminal justice in this country if he thinks that for 175 years before Miranda we managed very well,&quot; writes Leonard Levy, a legal historian at Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, Calif. &quot;In fact we managed disgracefully.&quot;    Some experts also dispute the contention that the decision has had a disruptive effect. Yale Kamisar, a University of Michigan Law School professor, said that Miranda not only hasn't hurt law enforcement, &quot;It's done some good in that it has made police more aware that someone's looking over their shoulder. It has made clear that everyone's got some rights, even the most despicable suspect.&quot;    Prof. Kamisar and others contend that the administration is only taking aim at Miranda as part of its political agenda to attack many of the liberal decisions of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren. In a planning report called &quot;Truth in Criminal Justice&quot; released in January, Justice Department officials even wrote that the value of overturning the Miranda decision would be enhanced &quot;because of its symbolic status as the epitome of Warren Court activism.&quot;    Underlying this controversy over the Miranda ruling are questions about the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Proposed by the first Congress in 1789 and ratified by the states in 1791, the amendment says, &quot;No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .&quot;    In the Miranda decision, the Supreme Court said the compulsion barred by the Fifth Amendment wasn't limited to formal testimony at a trial or before a grand jury. Being in police custody and being questioned also creates a compulsion to speak, the court ruled.    The court cited studies that showed that before the Miranda decision, there were extensive police efforts to force suspects to confess by wearing them down with endless interrogation, confusing them about their rights or inflicting physical abuse. For example, in one of the four separate cases decided by the Supreme Court as part of the Miranda ruling, a suspect was held by Los Angeles police for five days and was questioned nine times before confessing to robbery and murder.    To protect against such compulsion, the high court spelled out detailed procedures for police to follow -- the so-called Miranda warnings that have become a part of American culture through years of television police dramas. The court said a person in custody must be advised before questioning of &quot;the right to remain silent,&quot; that &quot;anything said can and will be used against the individual in court,&quot; of the &quot;right to have counsel present at the interrogation,&quot; and that an &quot;indigent&quot; person may have &quot;a lawyer . . . appointed to represent him.&quot;    The court said these unusually specific warnings weren't the only way to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege from police abuse. &quot;Congress and the states are free to develop their own safeguards for the privilege, so long as they are fully as effective,&quot; the court said.    Law-enforcement organizations complained loudly about the decision, and Congress tried to overrule it in 1968. But even now, when the Reagan administration attacks the warnings as an example of the court's usurping the role of Congress, no serious legislative effort has ever been made to use an alternative procedure.    Evidence on the impact is sketchy. The Justice Department report said studies show &quot;a major adverse effect&quot; from Miranda on the willingness of suspects to talk. But the few studies it cited were done in the first year after the ruling, and some were inconclusive. These studies suggest fewer confessions, but not reduced convictions.    &quot;Now that police must follow Miranda's principles,&quot; writes Stephen Schulhofer, a University of Chicago Law School professor, &quot;They have found . . . they can get statements without using compelling pressures or get convictions without using confessions at all.&quot;    Jerald Vaughn, executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, favors major changes in the Miranda rules, but adds, &quot;Opinion in the law enforcement community is divided. We have literally a whole generation of police officers who have never known police work except under Miranda.&quot;    Some experts say the Supreme Court has been retrenching on Miranda, partly because the growing percentage of drug-related criminal cases provide a less-sympathetic vehicle for concern about suspects' rights. In 1984, the court said police could talk to a suspect first and read the Miranda warnings later if &quot;public safety&quot; was jeopardized. In a 1985 decision whose impact isn't yet clear, the court ruled that proof of actual police pressure may be required before courts throw out incriminating statements, thus undercutting Miranda's premise that police questioning of persons in custody inherently involves compulsion.    But if the future of the decision is shaky, legal historians say its foundation in history is largely solid. When the Fifth Amendment was passed, Claremont's Prof. Levy writes, there were no police, and pretrial questioning was by justices of the peace. The privilege against self-incrimination was aimed at that form of interrogation. By the mid-19th century, police questioning had supplanted the justices of the peace.    Only the warnings themselves are &quot;devoid of historical support,&quot; Prof. Levy writes. Before 1966, suspects could refuse to incriminate themselves, but they didn't have to be told that it was their right. </TEXT></DOC>
