(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A prosecutor pursuing a case against twoformer television news executives charged with tapping into thecomputer of a competing station says such a crime is similar toburglary.   Former WTSP-Channel 10 news director Terry Cole and MichaelShapiro, assistant news director at the ABC affiliate, were chargedWednesday with 17 counts of computer hacking and conspiracy in thetheft of information through computer phone lines. They werescheduled for a May 19 court appearance.   ``It's no different than digging a tunnel under their office andcoming up and rummaging through their desks,'' Chief AssistantState Attorney Chris Hoyer said. ``It's high-tech burglary.''   If convicted, each could get up to 85 years in prison.   They are accused of raiding the files of WTVT-Channel 13, a CBSaffiliate between November 1988 and January.   Before joining WTSP, Shapiro was an assignment manager at WTVTand helped set up security for that station's newsroom computer,including passwords and identification codes intended to keep filesconfidential.   Shapiro, 33, was arrested in February. Cole, 32, his boss, wasarrested in April.   Vincent Barresi, general manager of WTSP, said his station hasnever condoned hacking and that Shapiro and Cole were fired.   Hoyer nevertheless said he is considering a civil lawsuit toseize the station's assets under Florida's racketeering laws, whichlet an organization be penalized for profiting from criminalactivity.   ``Hopefully that would not be the case,'' WTSP attorney C.Philip Campbell Jr. said. ``The station continues to cooperate.It's in Mr. Hoyer's hands.''   Hoyer said his decision on a racketeering lawsuit will beaffected by whether WTVT sues WTSP.   ``They're the victims in this case and we're waiting to see whatthey do,'' Hoyer said.   WTVT news director Bob Franklin said corporate executives werestill discussing that decision with attorneys.</TEXT></DOC>
