Early Christmas Day 1978, columns of tanks charged down Route 14from Ban Me Thuot in the Central Highlands to start Vietnam'sinvasion of Cambodia and war with its former Communist comrade, theKhmer Rouge.   Shielded by massive artillery and air barrages, a dozen divisionssurged west across the border including Route 7 and Route 1 leadingto Phnom Penh. One after another strategic points fell on the eastbank of the Mekong River: Kratie, Stung Treng, Neak Luong.   On Jan. 6, the Vietnamese crossed to the west bank at Neak Luongand the next day marched into Phnom Penh. So unexpectedly swift wasthe strike that the Khmer Rouge rulers left behind half-eaten mealsand tons of arms as they fled.   On Jan. 10 a new Communist government was proclaimed, led by aformer regional leader, commander Heng Samrin, and other Khmer Rougedefectors who had fled to Vietnam from the regime's bloody purges.   All major towns were in Vietnamese hands within a few weeks. Asweep in April left the Khmer Rouge in tatters and scattered alongthe mountains and malarial jungles of the Thai border to the west.   But sanctuary from Thailand and arms from China soon raised theKhmer Rouge up from its knees into a potent guerrilla insurgency.   The Third Indochina War, which was to split almost all Asia intotwo hostile camps, was just beginning.   North Vietnam helped build the Khmer Rouge in the 1950s and armedits insurgency against the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in 1970-75.   But its quarrel over territory, race and ideology flared in theopen with skirmishes in disputed areas just after the Khmer Rougeseized power from Lon Nol in April 1975.   The Khmer Rouge regime killed 1 million Cambodians in torturechambers and slave labor camps as it attempted to fashion a pureagrarian society.   The fanatics began raiding and shelling undisputed Vietnameseterritory in April 1977, burning down hundreds of villages andbeheading and mutilating men, women and children. Vietnameseofficials said the border conflict in 1977-78 killed 30,000Vietnamese.   Vietnamese forces made a major incursion in October 1977 and thefighting continued up to the full-scale war 14 months later. Theyset up secret camps in Vietnam to train an army of Khmer Rougedefectors.   Phan Hien, then a key Vietnamese negotiator, held talks on theborder clashes with Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.   ``Nothing came out of it. They didn't want to negotiate,'' saidPhan Hien, now minister of justice, in a recent interview in Hanoi.   The Khmer Rouge planned to try to seize Tay Ninh province andperhaps even the southern commercial center of Ho Chi Minh City,said Gen. Tran Cong Man, editor of the official Vietnamese armynewspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan.   No one in the leadership had reservations about invading becauseVietnam had no other choice, Man said, ``although we knew the worldwould not respond favorably.''   ``We wanted to withdraw as soon as possible, but ... they (theKhmer Rouge) got support from China and Thailand,'' said Vietnam'scurrent ambassador to Phnom Penh, Ngo Dien.   China went further. On Feb. 17, 1979, the People's LiberationArmy sent human waves across the frontier for a 16-day strike to``punish'' Vietnam for invading Cambodia. Tens of thousands died inthe fighting that laid waste to vast areas of northern Vietnam.   Vietnam obtained arms from the Soviet Union, with whom it signeda 25-year treaty the month before the invasion. Most non-CommunistAsian and Western nations joined China and Thailand in at leastdiplomatic backing for the guerrillas.   In June 1982, the guerrilla backers helped form a coalitionjoining the Khmer Rouge with the non-Communist forces of formerCambodian monarch Prince Norodom Sihanouk and former prime ministerSon Sann.   Each year, the struggle for Cambodia alternated betweenintensified dry season fighting and diplomacy in the fall at theUnited Nations, where the coalition was overwhelmingly supported asCambodia's government in the General Assembly.   Vietnamese forces broke the cycle with a five-month offensive in1984-85 that overran all major guerrilla bases inside the Cambodiaborder. They drove the guerrillas and the 300,000 civilians theycontrolled into Thailand. Fighting then subsided into mostly limitedguerrilla ambushes and psychological warfare in the villages.   Vietnam once declared the situation in Cambodia ``irreversible.''But diplomacy increased after a Communist Party congress in late1986 gave top priority to economic reconstruction.   In 1987, Sihanouk held his first talks with Phnom Penh's PrimeMinister Hun Sen. Vietnam first negotiated with the guerrillas in1988.   Nineteen nations conferred for a month in August in Paris. Butthey all failed to settle the quarrel over whether the Khmer Rougeshould participate in Cambodia's political future.   Vietnam claims it began annual partial troop pullouts in 1982.The departure of what it calls the last 26,000 opens a new phase ofthe war.</TEXT></DOC>
