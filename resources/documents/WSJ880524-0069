More recently, businesses have used it to induce managers to retire early.    Many companies didn't know -- and apparently didn't care -- how much those promises would cost. The bills came in; they paid them.    No more. The prospect of keeping employees healthy after they retire is making a lot of companies sick these days. And the corporations' attempts to heal themselves may soon mean much less generous benefits for current and future retirees -- though any moves in that direction are likely to meet determined opposition.    With the population aging and health-care costs surging, companies that have toted up the long-term cost of their past health-care promises have been shocked at the result. In many cases, says Ted Allen, a senior vice president at consultant Management Compensation Group, the present value of future liabilities is 20% to 40% of a company's net worth. At some smokestack companies, it exceeds net worth.    Allied-Signal Corp. won't disclose the specific amount of the liabilities it recently calculated, but E.M. Halkyard, senior vice president of human resources for the aerospace and automotive company, says, &quot;When a number gets over $1 billion, it attracts our attention.&quot;    According to a 1986 survey by Equicor, an employee-benefits joint venture of Equitable Life Assurance Society and Hospital Corp. of America, 41% of employers had already made cost-cutting changes in retiree health plans. Most were minor, such as mandatory second opinions and increased deductibles.    But corporate planners and consultants say changes are likely to become more prevalent and more profound. Possibilities range from adding &quot;keep-healthy&quot; programs for retirees to cutting back benefits for retirees to eliminating retiree health care altogether.    &quot;There's a lot of awareness of the issue now,&quot; says Anna Rappaport, a managing director of consultant William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc. &quot;Not many people have changed their plans yet, but there will be a whole bunch that will change them next year.&quot;    A lot of people could be affected. According to a survey by Jonathan C. Dopkeen of the Health Policy Institute at Boston University, the percentage of companies offering retiree health-care benefits ranges from 42% for concerns with fewer than 100 employees to 94% for those with 10,000 or more workers. The plans typically cover hospitalization, some doctors' fees and medicine, with most employers paying the entire cost of coverage.    One big impetus for change is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the main accounting-standards body, which is scrutinizing companies' future health-care obligations. If the FASB has its way -- and it likely will in the near future -- some of those future costs and liabilities are going to show up soon in company earnings reports and balance sheets.    Right now most companies show in their earnings reports only what they actually pay out for health care in any given year. The FASB wants them to estimate the present value of their future obligations and phase in a charge to current income for that, too. Richard Ostuw, a vice president with consultant Towers Perrin, estimates that companies' expenses for health-care benefits now total only about 1% of their payroll -- but if they had to take into account future costs, those expenses -- would total about 12% of their payroll.    Indeed, a Towers Perrin study of 76 companies shows the change could cut profits roughly in half. For the Fortune 100 companies it could reduce profits by roughly a quarter, or some $17 billion.    Companies were long able to overlook their future health-care costs. That's partly because retirees represented a smaller demographic slice in the past than they do now and will in the years ahead, and health insurance wasn't as expensive in real terms.    But now an aging population means more retirees to care for. Michael J. Gulotta, president and chief actuary of Actuarial Sciences Associates Inc., a Piscataway, N.J., unit of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., says the ratio of workers to retirees at the average U.S. company now is about 3 to 1; it will drop to about 2 to 1 by the year 2000. At some companies the ratio is reversed. Bethlehem Steel Corp., for example, has 33,000 active employees and 70,000 retirees and surviving spouses.    Many corporate retirees these days are leaving their companies in their 50s or early 60s. But, although cost cutting was the corporate motive for letting these people go, many companies are finding their health care unexpectedly expensive.    Jere Weliver, director of personnel services for Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, says the cost to the company of health benefits for retirees under 65 averages about 60% more than the cost of benefits for active workers of all ages. Medicare picks up much of the medical insurance cost for over-65 retirees, so the cost to companies of their care is much less.    And of course, health-care costs are rising faster than inflation -- at some companies, much faster. In 1987, Allied-Signal's health-care costs rose about 39% overall; at some locations they jumped 60%.    But retiree health care is a delicate issue, and trying to cut it may be like trying to trim Social Security. &quot;This is a very important, sacred benefit,&quot; says Herbert Nehrling, assistant treasurer of Du Pont Co. &quot;Companies will think long and hard before they change it.&quot;    Jack Christy, senior policy analyst for the American Association of Retired Persons, says, &quot;It's a major cause for concern.&quot; Loss of health coverage, he adds, &quot;could put a major financial squeeze on retirees.&quot; Officials from the association have testified in Congress in support of pending legislation to restrict companies' ability to cut out retiree health plans.    Here are some strategies companies are considering, or have tried, from the most benign to the most severe.    PREVENTIVE MEDICINE: Commonwealth Edison so far is relying on a program of &quot;health awareness and consumerism&quot; introduced in 1986, says the company's Mr. Weliver. The program, directed mainly at active employees, includes stress-management classes, a &quot;wellness&quot; program, mandatory second opinions, stop-smoking clinics and blood-pressure screening. &quot;I would expect in the future, as active employees retire, they will carry better health and better consumer habits for medical care to their retired position,&quot; Mr. Weliver says.    SET UP RESERVES: Many companies would like to set up funds, much like pension funds, to cover the costs of retiree health care. A fund wouldn't cut the cost of care, but it would set up a reserve for future liabilities.    Unlike pension funds, however, health-care funds face big problems. One is taxes. Companies get tax breaks for contributions to pension funds, and earnings on those funds accumulate tax-free. With a few minor exceptions, funds used for health benefits don't; company planners don't expect that to change any time soon. Another problem is unpredictability. Future pension obligations usually are fixed, but health obligations aren't.    Some companies, including Du Pont, are pressing Washington for changes that would allow them to use excess pension money to fund health-care plans. But such proposals face strong opposition from unions and retiree groups alike.    RESTRICT BENEFITS FOR FUTURE RETIREES: Allied-Signal is considering length-of-service requirements for retiree health care. Right now, all retirees leave the company with the same health coverage. Under the proposals, the company's contribution to a retiree's health plan would be tied to the number of years worked before retirement, says Mr. Halkyard of Allied-Signal.    At Bethlehem Steel, retirees leave the company with the same health-care provisions they had as active employees; today those provisions are more restrictive than for those who retired earlier.    RESTRICT BENEFITS FOR CURRENT RETIREES: Some companies are raising deductibles, lowering the amount of premium they pay, or ending health coverage for retirees who take other jobs. Patrick Dutson, a managing director with Mercer Meidinger, says a large Midwestern consumer-products company switched from covering all health costs for retirees to providing a fixed annual payment toward health insurance. &quot;The implication is that as medical costs increase in the future, the employee will have to contribute an increasingly significant portion of the cost,&quot; Mr. Dutson says.    When Bethlehem Steel tried in 1984 to increase deductibles, add a premium and increase the percentage of the cost that employees and retirees paid, the pensioners went to court. The parties later settled, with Bethlehem softening the changes for retirees.    CANCEL RETIREE BENEFITS: When LTV Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1986, it tried to treat retiree health and life insurance benefits as it would debts owed to any other creditors. It canceled them -- and promptly incurred a strike at one location and the threat of a strike throughout the company. Facing the loss of much-needed production, the company quickly reinstated the benefits. &quot;The lawyers may have had law on their side,&quot; says an LTV spokesman, &quot;but they didn't realize what the personal impact would be.&quot; In other cases, courts have reinstated canceled plans.    But, says Mercer Meidinger's Ms. Rappaport, more companies are considering severely curtailing or canceling retiree health benefits, despite the threat of lawsuits. &quot;It's clearly risky,&quot; she says. &quot;There is a good chance that you will get sued, but it's not automatic that you can't do it, or you can't win.&quot;    ---              Paying the Doctor After Retirement                     Who Gets Benefits   Big Firms offering medical benefits to retirees, broken down by length of employment necesary:                   No requirements                Early        10%                Normal       40%                   Five years or less                Early        10%                Normal       43%                        10 years                Early        50%                Normal       10%                    More than 10 years                Early        12%                Normal        0%                Varies by age at retirement                Early        18%                Normal        0%                    No retiree medical                Early         1%                Normal        6%   Source: Towers Perrin                      COST OF CARE   The cost of health-care benefits to retirees, as a percentage of pension benefits, is much larger for early retirees      Annual      Salary at             RETIREMENT AT AGE 65      Retirement       Pension      Health Care    Ratio      $100,000         $390,000       $32,000        8%        50,000          177,000        32,000       18%        25,000           72,000        32,000       44%        15,000           35,700        32,000       91%                            RETIREMENT AT AGE 55      $100,000         $162,000       $55,000       34%        50,000           73,000        55,000       75%        25,000           30,000        55,000      183%        15,000           15,700        55,000      367%   Source: Tillinghast, Nelson andamp; Warren</TEXT></DOC>
