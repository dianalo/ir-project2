(tips for creating editable outlines ofpopular Mac fonts)(Solutions) (tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wasson, Gregory.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Graphic artists today uses geometrical letterforms in much thesame way as other object-oriented graphics.andP;  Nine methods ofcreating editable font outlines are presented.andP;  Most of themethods work only with PostScript fonts and involve auto-tracing,scanning, or screen capture.andP;  Printing may require a true AdobePostScript printer.andP;  Illustrator and Freehand let users work withtemplates created by screen-dump files of characters scaled withAdobe Type Manager (ATM).andP;  Some paint programs provide auto-traceutilities which will also work with ATM text.andP;  These methods workonly with Adobe Type 1 fonts.andP;  Font conversion programs such asTypeStyler and Metamorphosis are designed to convert entire fontsdirectly to outlines.andP;  Users can also obtain text to auto-traceinto a font outline with a scanner or digitizing tablet.andP;  TheQuark Xpress page-layout program has commands to capture outlinesof Type 3 fonts.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Graphics SoftwareFontsTutorial.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Capturing Font OutlinesandM;Modern typographical design involves more than simply selecting the rightfont for the situation.andP;  As geometric shapes, letterforms have become anintegral part of the graphic artist's toolbox, lending themselves todistortion, collage, and various other kinds of manipulation.andP;  To use lettersin this way in computer graphics programs, you must be able to convert textcharacters into editable graphic outlines and then manipulate them with anobject-oriented program such as FreeHand, Illustrator, or MacDraw (see Figure1).andM;The simplest, least expensive solution is to use a drawing program to enterthe letters in the largest available point size and then to hand-trace thetext (preferably with a polygon tool) at high magnification.andP;  This methodcould give you the quality you're after, if you're willing to spend timeadjusting lines and tweaking tiny details.andP;  If you have the right tools,however, you can capture letters -- or even entire alphabets -- with aminimum of time and frustration.andM;The ToolboxandM;There are endless combinations of programs, hardware, utilities, andtechniques that let you obtain editable font outlines.andP;  This articlehighlights nine possible scenarios, each of which uses a particular kind ofsoftware and/or hardware.andP;  Most capture only one letter at a time, but acouple let you snare the whole character set in one fell swoop (see Figure2).andP;  One of these combinations may match the equipment you already have onhand; if not, determine which method is most cost-effective for you andinvest in a font-filled future.andM;Before we get to the specific scenarios, here's a short list of elements thatmany of the methods have in common:andM;Fonts.andP;  The methods may work with Type 1 fonts, Type 3 fonts, or both.andP;  Type1 fonts are Adobe-style encrypted fonts.andP;  Adobe used to be the sole purveyor,but many third-party vendors -- Bitstream, Compugraphic, and Monotype, amongothers -- now provide part or all of their typeface libraries in Type 1format.andP;  Type 3 fonts are unencrypted, and third-party vendors produce themusing Fontographer or other type-creation tools.andM;Auto-tracing.andP;  Several scenarios use the auto-tracing capabilities now foundin many graphics programs (see &quot;The Elements of Auto-Tracing&quot; in this issue).andO;Some of the programs that have an auto-tracing feature include Canvas,DeskPaint, Digital Darkroom, FreeHand, Illustrator, Streamline, SuperCard,SuperPaint, and UltraPaint.andM;Scanning.andP;  Scanners come in several flavors and are available from manycompanies.andP;  You can use anything from a hand-held monochrome scanner to aflatbed color scanner.andM;Screen capture.andP;  Several utilities let you convert all or part of your screenimage into a PICT or PICT2 file for later editing.andP;  These utilities includeCapture (Mainstay), Exposure (Preferred Publishers), and QuickShot (BostonCompanies).andM;Printing.andP;  Where specified, you need a true Adobe PostScript printer such asa LaserWriter IINT.andP;  If you use ATM for font scaling, you can use anon-PostScript printer such as the HP DeskJet or LaserJet, the GCC PersonalLaserPrinter, or even an ImageWriter.andP;  The printer can be used in three ways:andM;* As a source for creating printed letters from built-in fonts.andP;  Afterprinting, these can be scanned and then traced.andP;  Adobe PostScript printerscan print Type 1 and Type 3 fonts in practically any size.andP;  Some PostScriptclones can do this only with Type 3 fonts; other printers come with their ownoutline-font system and can print a limited set at large sizes.andM;* As a source of font-outline information, so that editable outlines can beproduced directly and accurately from data stored in the printer.andM;* As a resource for computing (but not printing) a large font bit map thatcan be displayed on-screen and saved as a traceable image.andM;Scenario 1: ATM, screen-capture utility, Illustrator or FreeHandandM;1.andP;  Enter the character(s) you want to convert, using the largest point sizethat fits on-screen.andP;  Version 1.9.3 of Illustrator lets you specify 1,000points or larger.andP;  FreeHand 2.02 limits smoothly created text to 127 pointsand, unfortunately, scales the bit-mapped font characters from there.andP;  Inother programs, the maximum font size might be around 500 points.andM;2.andP;  Capture the character with any screen-capture utility, and save the dumpas a PICT file.andM;3.andP;  In Illustrator, use the screen-dump file as a template when you open anew file.andP;  In FreeHand, use the Place command to import the file into adocument.andM;4.andP;  Use either program's auto-tracing tool to trace the character from theimported bit map.andM;Pros: Simple procedure; excellent outline-editing capabilities.andM;Cons: Restricts you to outlines of Type 1 fonts (Type 3 fonts don't work withATM).andM;Scenario 2: ATM plus Canvas, UltraPaint, or SuperPaintandM;1.andP;  Choose a Type 1 font, and enter the characters you want at the maximumpoint size the menu provides.andM;2.andP;  Select the text block, and scale it to any size you want (using the menuor by dragging).andP;  ATM will re-image smooth text when the block is resized.andM;3.andP;  Convert the text to a bit map: In Canvas or UltraPaint, convert the textblock into a bit map; in SuperPaint, select the text block and choose Cut toPainting.andM;4.andP;  Auto-trace the text block, using the built-in function in each program.andO;Tweak UltraPaint's and SuperPaint's trace controls to get the best results.andM;Pros: Good curve editing in all three programs.andP;  SuperPaint can producePostScript outlines; Canvas 2.1 and UltraPaint can convert their QuickDrawoutlines to PostScript through the Canvas Separator utility.andM;Cons: Works only with Type 1 fonts.andP;  Canvas' auto-tracing usually creates toomany control points (see Figure 3).andP;  Canvas and UltraPaint need a separateutility to produce PostScript curves.andM;Scenario 3: TypeStyler plus Type 1 or Type 3 fontsandM;1.andP;  Use TypeStyler's Font Converter command to select and convert a Type 1 orType 3 font to the SmoothFont format.andP;  (Note: The program crashes with someAdobe Originals fonts, such as Lithos and Juniper.andP;  It also can't convertcomposite Type 3 fonts -- that is, fonts created in Fontographer that arebased on Type 1 fonts.)andM;2.andP;  Click the text tool on the drawing area to bring up the Text Attributesdialog box.andP;  Choose the converted font's name and enter the desiredletter(s).andM;3.andP;  At this point, you can work with the outline within TypeStyler or use theExport command to save the text outline as an Illustrator file.andM;Pros: Converting fonts directly to outlines is simple and bypasses digitizingand tracing errors.andP;  TypeStyler is relatively inexpensive ($199.95) and canperform extensive font manipulation in addition to creating font outlines.andM;Cons: None worth mentioning.andM;Scenario 4: FontLiner, Type 3 fontsandM;1.andP;  In FontLiner, open a Type 3 outline-font file.andM;2.andP;  Choose to make either filled or outlined characters.andM;3.andP;  Choose whether you want to convert the standard 94 ASCII characters orthe entire character set (256 characters).andM;4.andP;  Select the Convert command.andP;  FontLiner saves the outlines as anIllustrator 1.1 file.andM;Pros: Fast conversion.andP;  Makes editable outlines directly from font-outlineinformation, which bypasses digitizing and tracing errors.andP;  FontLinerconverts some or all characters of a font in one pass.andP;  Inexpensive($129.95).andM;Cons: FontLiner works only with Type 3 fonts that were created inFontographer, and converting fonts to outlines is its only function.andO;Occasional conversion errors.andM;Scenario 5: Metamorphosis, Adobe PostScript printerandM;1.andP;  In Metamorphosis, open the font file you want to convert.andM;2.andP;  Select EPS Format under the Options menu.andP;  If you want to convert all 256characters of the character set (including European accents), click on thatoption.andM;3.andP;  Choose the Generate command.andP;  Metamorphosis uses the PostScript printerto create the outlines, which are saved in an Illustrator 1.1 file.andM;Pros: Can convert an entire Type 1 or Type 3 font set into editable outlinesat the same time.andP;  Converting a font set directly to outlines is astraightforward process and bypasses digitizing and tracing errors.andM;Cons: Requires an Adobe PostScript printer.andP;  Metamorphosis is somewhat pricey($295) and has only one function.andP;  Evolution, due out soon from ImageClub,will accomplish the same thing for about $200 less -- and it doesn't requirea printer.andM;Scenario 6: Smart Art, Adobe PostScript printer, auto-tracing programandM;1.andP;  Open the Smart Art DA.andM;2.andP;  Choose a simple effect such as the Sample Effect.andM;3.andP;  Enter the character(s) you want to convert into a graphic outline.andP;  Makesure the angle is 0 degrees and the fill is 100 percent.andP;  Set the point sizeanywhere between 500 and 1,000 points.andM;4.andP;  Press the Reimage button.andP;  Smart Art will send the PostScript data to theprinter and instruct the printer to return a bit map to the Mac.andM;5.andP;  Select the Export command, and select TIFF 600 dpi from the pop-up Formatmenu.andP;  Name and save the file.andM;6.andP;  Produce an outline with the auto-tracer of your choice.andM;Pros: Fast.andP;  Creates excellent traceable forms of a character in any Type 1or Type 3 font.andM;Cons: Requires an Adobe PostScript printer.andM;Scenario 7: Scanner, auto-tracing programandM;1.andP;  Obtain crisp, well-printed text (the bigger the better), or use anysuitable program and printer to output large, smooth characters (127 to 500points).andM;2.andP;  Scan the output as line art.andP;  Save the scanned text as a 300-dpi TIFFimage or as a 72-dpi paint or PICT file.andM;3.andP;  Trace the image in the auto-tracing program of your choice.andM;Pros: Straightforward method.andP;  Creates good outlines.andP;  Can use any printedmaterial, not just available fonts.andM;Cons: Requires more steps than direct-conversion techniques such asTypeStyler or Metamorphosis.andM;Scenario 8: Digitizing tablet, drawing programandM;1.andP;  Obtain crisp, well-printed text (the bigger the better), or use anysuitable program and printer to output large, smooth characters (127 to 500points).andP;  When you use a digitizing tablet, the largest characters work best.andM;2.andP;  Open a drawing program, and trace the image with the stylus of yourdigitizing tablet.andP;  Use a freehand, curve, or polygon tool or a combinationof these.andM;Pros: Works with any printed material, not just available fonts.andM;Cons: Quality depends on hand steadiness and tablet capabilities.andP;  Needslarge characters for best results.andM;Scenario 9: QuarkXPress, Type 3 fonts, screen-capture utility, auto-tracingprogramandM;1.andP;  In QuarkXPress, open a new document.andM;2.andP;  Use the Render Limit command to set the limit to 25 points.andP;  This tellsQuarkXPress that for all Type 3 fonts, it should create font sizes greaterthan 24 points mathematically (this approach produces smooth scaling with nojagged edges).andM;3.andP;  Select a Type 3 font in the largest point size that will fit on-screen.andO;Enter your character(s).andP;  If you are running ATM, you can also use a Type 1font.andM;4.andP;  Capture the character(s) with any screen-capture utility, and save thedump as a PICT file.andM;5.andP;  Trace the dump with an auto-tracing program.andM;Pros: Can capture outlines of Type 3 fonts, alone or in combination with Type1 fonts.andM;Cons: Requires several programs.andP;  If you don't already own QuarkXPress, thismethod is probably not for you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
