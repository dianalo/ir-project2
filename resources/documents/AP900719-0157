Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., gsaidthe May 1 report was leaked to them by ``a source in theadministration.''   The White House declined comment. A spokesman for InteriorSecretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said the report was an internal documentthat never was intended for release.   ``They are just playing partisan politics,'' said the spokesman,Steve Goldstein.   The report prepared by the Forest Service, an arm of therAgriculture Department, and the Bureau of Land Management, part ofthe Interior Department, outlines ways to save as many as 21,000timber jobs by, among other things, adding new restrictions on logexports and boosting spending on Forest Service programs, DeFaziosaid.   He said it was prepared for release at the same time the twoagencies projected that one controversial plan to save the owlwould cut timber harvests in the region by nearly 50 percent andcost the region more than 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade.   Each nesting pair of owls needs large areas of undisturbedold-growth forest to survive. The Fish and Wildlife Service lastmonth classified the owl as an endangered species, which means thegovernment must come up with a protection plan.   The Bush administration has not drafted complete plans, but hassaid it expects 1,000 timber jobs in the Northwest will be lost.Bush has said he wants to balance the needs of timber communitiesagainst owl protection.   ``This report has been suppressed by the administration,''DeFazio said during a hastily called news conference at his office.   ``I find it absolutely outrageous that the administration on May1 could give on us one-half of the equation _ that is they droppedon us the job impacts, the fear of loss of livelihood that came toso many thousands of people in the Pacific Northwest.   DeFazio said Forest Service workers have told him of the reportand have been urging him to obtain a copy of it for several weeks,but he said administrators denied it existed.   Goldstein declined comment on the allegation that administrationofficials denied the document existed: ``I can't speak to that. Idon't know who they talked to,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
