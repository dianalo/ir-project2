BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pair of labor disputes threaten to forceDemocratic National Convention delegates, one quarter of whombelong to labor unions, to avoid certain parties and to crosspicket lines unless they want to walk to the convention.   The Democrats, who count heavily on labor support, are hopingthe disputes can be resolved, or at least neutralized. One unionlocal says its parent union is pressuring it not to set up picketlines.   Intricate transportation plans could be snarled if transitworkers carry out threats to picket bus pickup points at hotels anddowntown rail stations beginning Monday, the first day of theconvention.   In addition, social events for some of the party's elite, plus alive broadcast of ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' on Friday couldbe disrupted by a campaign seeking to organize the city's janitors.   The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is providing106 of the 185 or so shuttle buses being used to ferry delegatesand workers from Atlanta's hotels to the convention site.   Although management and party officials question whether thetransit union can picket legally because it is forbidden by statelaw from striking, they admit privately that hard-core unionmembers coming to the convention would be unlikely to stand ontechnicalities.   Ralph Green, vice president of Local 732 of the AmalgamatedTransit Union, said Wednesday international president Jim LaSala``has called me and asked me to retract our position and he askedme to call together the executive committee Friday and he's goingto appeal to them to change their position.''   Transit workers have been working without a contract since Oct.19.   Ruth Berry, spokewoman for the Democratic National Committee,said Wednesday the party did not have enough information to advisedelegates how to respond to the threatened pickets.   Meanwhile, Justice for Janitors, an organizing effort by theService Employees International Union, threatens to embarrass cityleaders who have struggled to portray Atlanta as the progressivecapital of the New South.   The union has targeted noted Atlanta developer-architect JohnPortman, and his home base of Peachtree Center, even though Portmandoes not directly employ janitors but uses janitorial servicecompanies.   Peachtree Center is a complex of office buildings in the centerof downtown, including the site of several high-profile socialevents during the convention.   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and CorettaScott King, widow of the slain civil rights leader Martin LutherKing Jr., have written letters supporting the union and MayorAndrew Young has attempted to mediate the dispute.   In a letter sent to delegates this week, Portman said he isneutral in the organizing battle. But union officials say hiscompanies have harassed janitors and discouraged efforts toorganize janitorial service companies.   Although neither Portman nor his companies hire janitorsdirectly, ``he's the person that we have to deal with because hecontrols the money,'' said union spokeswoman Barbara Webber.   Portman also has ownership interest in several of the city'slargest hotels, including the Marriott Marquis, one of twoheadquarters hotels and the location of Friday's scheduled livebroadcast of ``Good Morning America.''   ``Since `Good Morning America' is set for a live broadcast, wethink we can do something there to attract attention,'' said RobertSarason, regional coordinator for the janitors' union.   The union also plans pickets or other demonstrations at a brunchfor Congress members Sunday given by USA Today and it parentcompany, Gannett, at The Atlanta Apparel Mart, a private dinnerthat night at Portman's home for Democratic National Committeetrustees and a reception for delegates at the Marquis on Wednesdaygiven by Delta Air Lines.   The union says it will not seek to disrupt two events hosted byYoung, even though they take place at Portman-owned buildings.</TEXT></DOC>
