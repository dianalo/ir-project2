The purpose of this EIS is to satisfythe requirements of NEPA and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,which has held that the 1986 Environmental Assessment prepared by the servicefor control of the red fox at Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge and NavalWeapons Station-Seal Beach was inadequate. See <T3>Animal Lovers Volunteer Association, Inc., v. Carlucci, Secretary ofDefense, et al., </T3>86-6428 9th Cir. 1988. The EIS will provide Serviceand Navy decisionmakers with a comprehensive analysis of alternative actions.Furthermore, the EIS will provide the rationale for selecting the bestmanagement actions and techniques which could be implemented or continuedat the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge and Naval Weapons Station-SealBeach to ensure the protection and enhancement of the endangered speciesand other wildlife, while minimizing impacts to other resources. The purpose of and the need for action is the protection of the endangeredCalifornia least tern, and the endangered light-foot clapper rail at SealBeach National Wildlife Refuge/Naval Weapons Station-Seal Beach. The implementationof actions to protect these two endangered species is necessary due tothe species' limited habitat, environmental factors, and particularly predationof these birds and their nests by red fox, thereby seriously limiting thepossibility of a stable or growing population of these endangered species.The EIS will address various measures which afford protection of thesetwo endangered species at Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge/Naval WeaponsStation-Seal Beach. The EIS will also address efforts which may assistin the overall recovery of these endangered species as mandated by theEndangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1531, <T3>et seq., </T3>as amended. A principal focus of the EIS will be on predationproblems and predator control techniques.Alternatives will be examined for their potential benefits and impactsto other wildlife resources, including predators such as the red fox. Impactson Navy operations, and the surrounding environment, including potentialsocial impacts such as the presence and observation of red fox in surroundingneighborhoods will also be analyzed.The Service and the Navy urge all interested parties to provide commentsregarding the scope of this EIS, the alternatives to be developed, andthe potential significant environmental impacts which may occur from theimplementation of alternative actions. The ideas and concerns of interestedparties may be expressed at the scoping meeting or provided in writingto the address listed above. Written comments must be received by the Serviceby February 15, 1989.The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordancewith the requirements of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4371, <T3>et seq., </T3> NEPA Regulations, 40 CFR Part 1500, <T3>et seq., </T3>other appropriate Federal regulations, and Service andNavy policy for compliance with those regulations.It is estimated that a Draft EIS will be made available for public reviewand comment during June 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David L.
