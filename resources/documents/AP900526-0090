(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal officials know the whereabouts ofa former police chief who disappeared 12 years ago but, at hisinstruction, they can't tell his wife and two children.   The Social Security Administration informed the family of JohnHoyt Kelley on Friday that Kelley is alive but does not want hiswhereabouts revealed.   Despite the distress it causes his family, federal privacy lawsrequire the agency to respect his wishes.   ``How do we know he's still alive? They just told us theyknow,'' said a sobbing Linda Kelley Bardin, Kelley's former wife.``We don't have any proof he's alive. I can't believe he wouldn'twant to let his kids know where he is or even to talk to them.''   Kelley was declared legally dead in 1987 to allow his childrento draw $17,363 from three life insurance policies.   Ms. Bardin said she received a letter Thursday instructing herto call a Social Security representative in El Dorado. She said shetalked to Betty Harper there Friday morning.   ``She said `I have some good news,''' Ms. Bardin said. ``I said`He's alive' and she said yes, but he had signed papers saying thathe did not want his kids or me to know his whereabouts.''   ``I'm not convinced. They tell me they did it, but I'm notconvinced the man they've found is him,'' she said.   Ms. Harper, reached by telephone Friday, confirmed that Kelley'sformer wife had been notified that her ex-husband was alive, butsaid further details could not be released.   Kelley joined the Crossett Police Department in 1964. Hedivorced his first wife 10 years later and was police chief by thetime he met Linda in 1975. He was 34, she was 27.   Ms. Bardin recalled that the family was happy, even thoughKelley kept secrets about where he went and how he spent his money.   She said she has learned he received $17,000 from the sale ofhis father's estate through 1976 and 1977, but said she had no ideaat the time that he received so much money.   Then threatening telephone calls began from people insistingKelley owed them money, Ms. Bardin said. Kelley began disappearingfor days at a time.   He resigned as police chief in January 1977 and moved the familyto Little Rock, where he worked as a salesman.   One day in 1978, he got up, helped his children get ready forschool, kissed his wife and told her he loved her, dropped thechildren off at a bus stop and drove away. He never returned.</TEXT></DOC>
