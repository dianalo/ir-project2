GE said most of the gains came in its so-calledlonger-cycle businesses, such as aircraft engines,power-generation systems and medical equipment, where salescycles are long and where GE's manufacturing operations areworking off a huge backlog of orders.</LP><TEXT>   Some of the shorter-cycle businesses, such as appliancesand materials, did less well -- although the appliancebusiness still had &quot;much higher&quot; operating profit despiteroughly flat revenue.   As a result, GE said its operating profit margin rose to12.9% of sales, eclipsing GE's record of 12.1% set in theyear-earlier quarter. GE said the improved margin and strongorder backlogs in the longer-cycle businesses mean that thedouble-digit earnings growth should continue through the endof the year.   The stock, after rising Friday in anticipation of theearnings report, was flat yesterday at $74.875 in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange.   &quot;The quarter was in line with expectations,&quot; Mark Altman,a securities analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc., said inexplaining why the stock didn't rise. &quot;But that's not to saythe expectations weren't very high.&quot;   Net income in the quarter totaled $1.09 billion, or $1.22a share, up from $972 million, or $1.08 a share, a yearearlier; revenue rose 7% to $14.35 billion from $13.53billion.   In the first half, earnings increased 12% to $2.04billion, or $2.28 a share, from $1.82 billion, or $2.02 ashare. Revenue climbed 6% to $26.95 billion from $25.43billion.   Commenting by product line, GE said operating profit andrevenue were both up strongly on aircraft engines andpower-generation systems. GE said it received about $2billion of orders for power-generation systems in the firsthalf, with demand for gas turbines especially high.   Among the other long-cycle businesses, technical productsand services had a &quot;good&quot; increase in operating profit on&quot;slightly higher&quot; revenue as orders for medical systemsincreased 15%. Aerospace operations -- such as radar andsatellites -- had flat revenue, and operating profitdeclined.   Industrial operations -- an agglomeration of businessessuch as lighting, electric motors and locomotives -- had flatrevenue, but operating profit was &quot;well ahead&quot; of a yearearlier.   Among the short-cycle operations, revenue was flat forappliances and materials. Although profit on appliances rose,it was flat for the materials operations. GE said its NBCbroadcasting unit had &quot;somewhat&quot; lower earnings and revenue.   GE financial services reported a 16% increase in earnings,as GE Capital again did well.</TEXT></DOC>
