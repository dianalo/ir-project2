The National Farmers Union said at its convention last week inLittle Rock, Ark., that 1990 farm legislation ``must increase incometo farmers through higher (price support) loan rates and supplymanagement'' of the major crops.   Yeutter, asked Monday in a telephone interview with farmbroadcasters about the NFU proposal, said he disagreed.   ``We tried that in the '50s and '60s in this country and thepolicy was an ignominious failure at that time,'' Yeutter said.``There is no reason to expect it to be any less than an ignominiousfailure this time around.''   The United States, he said, is operating much more in the globalmarket than it did 20 years ago and is relying more heavily onagricultural exports. This could not be done with higher pricesupports, he said.   Government loan rates essentially act as a floor on U.S. marketprices for such key commodities as wheat, corn and cotton. Whenmarket prices decline to the loan or support level, farmers oftentake out the government loans. If prices rise, they can pay off theloans and sell their products for cash.   Yeutter said he did not believe that when the U.S. price supportloans are raised other countries follow suit by boosting theirprices, thus keeping world markets on a fairly even keel.   Even if that happened on the short-term, the higher prices wouldbe ``great incentive'' for other farmers around the world to expandproduction and thereby create new surpluses and lower prices.   Robert A. Denman, NFU director of international and publicaffairs, said Yeutter's rejection of higher supports and productioncontrols raised a question about ``which policy has been theignominious failure'' in recent years.   ``We kind of think the price-cutting policy over the last eightyears and the way government programs have been run should be viewedas a greater ignominious failure,'' Denman said.   The NFU position was supported in Little Rock by officials of theNational Farmers Organization and the American Agriculture Movement.   Yeutter and U.S. trade representative Carla Hills were inBrussels, Belgium, Friday and Saturday for talks with the EuropeanEconomic Community on farm subsidies and the current Uruguay Roundof negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   The United States wants eventually to eliminate alltrade-distorting agricultural subsidies, while the EEC wantsshort-term measures included in the negotiations.   Yeutter reported ``some progress'' in the weekend discussions,adding that those were confined to GATT matters and did not includethe touchy separate issue of European rejection of U.S. meatcontaining growth hormones.   ``They are delicate negotiations, and it's always dangerous tocomment very much in the middle of the game,'' Yeutter said.   But he added that there had been a ``forward-looking discussionof short-term measures'' and ``reasonably good'' talks on long-termissues.   ``We certainly have not resolved the differences between us oneither of those issues,'' he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Private exporters have told the AgricultureDepartment that the Soviet Union has bought an additional 515,000metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department'sForeign Agricultural Service, said Monday the wheat was part of anauthorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under theExport Enhancement Program, or EEP.   Sims said the wheat is for shipment for April. Only 10,200 tonsare left in the current authorization.   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 4 milliontons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supplyagreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990.   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushelsof wheat. The 515,000 tons are equal to about 18.9 million bushelsworth around $78 million at recent U.S. farm prices of $4.13 perbushel.   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat andother designated commodities to specified countries at reducedprices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters thencollect free government surpluses of grain or other products asbonuses, or subsidies.   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement alsoincluded about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons ofsoybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons ofgrain sorghums.   Sims said the 515,000 tons of wheat were sold by Ferruzzi USAInc., 100,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 100,000; Garnac Grain CompanyInc., 75,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp. 40,000; Alfred C. ToepherInternational Inc., 50,000; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Gramplex Inc.,50,000; Mitsubishi International, 25,000; and Continental Grain Co.,25,000.   The companies will get subsidies of $22.70 per ton, or about 62cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Cancer Institute has approved $1million for a five-year study at Iowa State University, Ames, to seeif a cattle virus might hold some secrets that might be used in thefight against AIDS.   The project, reported Monday by the Agriculture Department, willinvolve bovine immunodeficiency-like virus, or BIV, to see if itdamages the immune system in cattle. The virus, which was discovered17 years ago by Martin J. Van Der Maaten at the department'sVirology Cattle Research Laboratory, Ames, was said to have ``somestructural similarities'' to the AIDS virus.   Jack Gruber of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.,said the cattle virus ``may provide a model useful for exploring thecomplexities of the human AIDS virus and possibly may be useful fordeveloping AIDS prevention strategies.''</TEXT></DOC>
