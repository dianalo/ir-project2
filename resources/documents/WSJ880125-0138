As part of the agreement, the Air Force won't suspend or bar the company from work on other contracts, as it often does in overcharge cases.    The government said company officials failed to disclose internal estimates of labor costs for separate contracts involving parts for canopy warning devices on F-4 Phantom jets and replacement parts for F-111 flight simulators. The Justice Department said company officials relied on such internal estimates, which were &quot;substantially lower&quot; than figures disclosed during negotiations with the government.    McDonnell Douglas, which didn't admit any wrongdoing, maintained that it wasn't required to disclose the lower estimates. But it pledged to &quot;exercise its best efforts&quot; to provide military contracting officials with such estimates involving other contracts.    In St. Louis, a spokesman for the company said that all investigations related to pricing of the 1981 contracts have been closed. McDonnell Douglas also said it isn't aware of similar allegations by the government involving any of its other military contracts.    The settlement requires the company to pay approximately twice as much as the government contends it was damaged. </TEXT></DOC>
