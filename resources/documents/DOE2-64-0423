In particular, numerical modeling is increasing in importancein a spectacular way. It now includes new fields, such as earth sciences,and is continuing to be enriched by important developments, even in sectorssuch as production where it has been used for 20 years. Such developmentswill necessarily be accompanied by adjustments in personnel trainingand in the operating of organizations.
