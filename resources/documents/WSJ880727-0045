The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 10.84 points Monday, gained 2.14 to 2073.97, although a late round of selling among blue-chip issues caused the average to retreat from its session highs, reached at midafternoon.    Other market averages fared slightly better than the Dow Jones industrials did. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index went up 0.51 to 265.19, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.29 to 150.03. Also, 764 issues rose in price on the Big Board, and 676 fell.    There was little of the dividend-related trading by institutions that had inflated the level of activity Monday, and New York Stock Exchange volume fell sharply as a result. About 122 million shares were traded on the Big Board -- the fourth lowest total of the year -- compared with 215.1 million the previous day.    Traders said the lack of interest in buying and selling that investors have shown recently was compounded by uncertainty about the GNP report, due to be released before Wednesday's opening. &quot;Certainly everyone is fixing their sights on the GNP number,&quot; said John Havens, a block trader at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Economists expect the report to show the economy expanded at a 3.4% annual rate in the second quarter, according to the consensus of a survey by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. In the first quarter, GNP grew at a 3.6% rate.    Given the market's recent jitters about the possibility of higher inflation and subsequent increases in interest rates, it is likely that the inflation measures included in the report will attract special attention. The measures are expected to show that prices rose at about a 4% annual rate during the second quarter, the survey said, which would be slightly higher than their first-quarter readings.    With the GNP report imminent, the market showed little reaction to the report of an 8.8% jump in June durable goods orders, which exceeded expectations, or a sharp plunge in commodity prices. The Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index skidded more than eight points -- one of its biggest one-day drops ever -- to the 245 level.    Morgan Stanley's Mr. Havens said he doesn't know whether the report's release will bring a pickup in the level of market activity. &quot;After GNP, there's always another number. It all depends on people's psychology,&quot; he said. &quot;If they still want to sit on their hands, that's what they'll do.&quot;    Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, was also skeptical that the GNP data will turn out to be a catalyst for the market. &quot;We're in that syndrome where you go from one figure to the next figure, and that means from one week to the next week,&quot; he said. &quot;There's certainly very little in the way of inspiration around.&quot;    Even so, he said, the market is likely to react badly if second-quarter economic growth proves stronger than expected, since it would feed the market's fears that inflation may accelerate and that the Federal Reserve may respond by pushing interest rates higher.    &quot;Clearly, anything decisive&quot; that moves interest rates up or down &quot;is going to push the stock market strongly,&quot; Mr. Miller added. &quot;The pressure is still toward higher rates, and that's going to inhibit where the stock market will be able to go.&quot;    Justin Mamis, a technical consultant at Cowen andamp; Co., says investors should prepare for the possibility that the market will drop over the next few weeks below the levels at which it bottomed out in late May. The low point for the Dow Jones industrials was reached May 23, when it closed at 1941.48.    &quot;There's no sign that stocks have hit their bottom,&quot; he said, noting that technical indicators remain negative and investors aren't demonstrating the kind of pessimism that usually occurs when the market hits a low point.    Chevron rose 1/2 to 47 as its second-quarter earnings turned out better than expected. The company recorded net income of $1.52 a share for the quarter, compared with $1.04 a year ago. Separately, the company said it formed two joint ventures with Nigeria's national oil company to market petroleum products in West Africa.    Other gainers among blue-chip issues included Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber, which climbed 1 7/8 to 60 5/8; Boeing, which rose 3/4 to 59; and Philip Morris, which gained 1 to 90. On the minus side, USX fell 1 to 30 1/8 despite reporting that its second-quarter earnings rose to 74 cents a share from 56 cents a year ago.    Armtek, which said Monday that Mark IV Industries had received federal clearance to begin acquiring up to 15% of the company's common shares, gained 2 7/8 to 35 1/2 on Big Board composite volume of 2.1 million shares. Mark IV wouldn't disclose whether it was buying any shares.    Amfac dropped 3/4 to 47 after agreeing in principle to be acquired by JMB Realty for $49 a share, or about $920 million. JMB's bid topped a $41-a-share leveraged buy-out offer from a management group.    San Diego Gas andamp; Electric rose 1 1/4 to 34 1/8. SCEcorp offered to acquire the utility in a stock swap calling for the exchange of 1.15 of its common shares for each share of San Diego Gandamp;E. SCEcorp closed unchanged at 31 3/8, while Tucson Electric Power, which had agreed earlier to merge with the company, gained 1/2 to 53 1/4.    Compaq Computer, which dipped 1 3/8 points Monday after its second-quarter earnings report proved disappointing, rebounded 1 1/2 to 58 7/8. Merrill Lynch boosted its estimate of Compaq's 1988 earnings to a range of $5.25 to $5.40 a share from $5.    Polaroid, the target of a $40-a-share takeover offer from Shamrock Holdings, went up 1 1/8 to 41 1/4 on Big Board composite volume of two million shares. The company said its board will give &quot;due consideration&quot; to Shamrock's offer but reaffirmed its commitment to the sale of 9.7 million shares to a new employee stock ownership plan as an anti-takeover move. Shamrock has filed suit to invalidate the plan.    Toro fell 1 3/8 to 19 1/4. Dain Bosworth lowered its rating on the stock and reduced its estimate of the company's earnings for fiscal 1988, which ends this month. An analyst at the firm said that the moves reflected sharply higher inventories of Toro lawn mowers.    The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.04 to 304.64. Amex volume totaled 8,570,000 shares, down from 9,650,000 on Monday. There were 269 issues advancing, 287 declining and 290 unchanged.    Bamberger Polymers advanced 1 3/8 to 12 3/4 after its chairman, Herbert M. Pearlman, said that he expects the company to report earnings of 47 cents a share for its second quarter, up from 30 cents a year ago.    Washington Post slid 3 to 194 1/2. The company said its earnings from operations for the latest second quarter dropped 4.2% to $78.1 million from $81.6 million a year earlier. The company reported net income of $3.83 a share, up from $3.29 a share a year earlier, primarily because of interest income and the company's equity in earnings of affiliates. </TEXT></DOC>
