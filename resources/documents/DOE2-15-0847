The results indicatethat, in the critical areas of design, material procurement, and manufacturing,vendor practices are essentially identical with differences only in documentation.Studies should be conducted to develop such information for other components.With this information at hand, utility engineers can more efficientlyfocus their attention on the additional measures necessary to completean item's verification.</TEXT></DOC>
