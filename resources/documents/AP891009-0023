Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet through Oct. 20at the biennial conference of the Convention on International Tradein Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. There were strategysessions Sunday, but the conference formally opens today.   Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, thesalmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species,attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory.   By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, formany an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoosby the turn of the century.   ``When we talk about halving the population in 10 years, we'retalking about disaster,'' Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a widely respectedexpert, said in an interview from Kenya.   David Western of Wildlife Conservation International, whocommissioned the last census, said: ``Numbers are dropping so fastelephants may be exterminated in most areas within 20 or 30 years.''   Overall, he said, just more than 600,000 remain in Africa,compared to estimates ranging from 1.3 million to 4 million adecade ago. Each year, poachers kill at least 70,000, oftenspraying gunfire at females and calves along with the few oldtuskers left.   In Kenya alone, fewer than 17,000 are left of the 165,000elephants counted in 1970.   The convention's rulings become non-legally binding agreementsthat rely on international pressure for enforcement. A conventionmember may abstain from a resolution, but risks being branded anenvironmental bad guy.   Delegates must find common ground between the East Africandemand for an ivory ban, backed by the United States and WesternEurope, and southern Africa's push for trade in culled tusks.   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana argue that carefulmanagement has increased their herds and that ivory financesanti-poaching measures.   ``We have a very healthy elephant population that must be culledor it will simply destroy its own environment,'' Bosman Olivier ofSouth Africa's Department for Environmental Affairs said inJohannesburg.   Zimbabwe earns $9 million a year by selling ivory from herdsestimated at 52,000.   ``You don't ban something valuable, you protect it,'' saidIngrid Schroeder of the Save Endangered African Wildlife, whichworks in Zimbabwe.   William Nduku, Zimbabwe's director of parks and wildlife said,``It's not fair to treat Africa as if it was a small country.''   But a broad coalition of experts and environmentalists,including Greenpeace and the Humane Society of the United States,say that exceptions to a ban leave doors wide open to abuse.   ``These arguments are based on a pack of lies: the numbers, thelevel of poaching and the ability to control trade,'' said CraigVan Note of the Washington-based Monitor Consortium.   Elephants and poachers ignore orders, experts say, and trade inwildlife products is as hard to control as drug trafficking.Documents are easy to falsify.   For example, Burundi lost its last elephant, an old bull, yearsago, but officials there have managed to export up to 100 tons peryear of ivory.   In 1986, the convention granted a blanket amnesty to 89 tons ofivory in Burundi as the start of an African quota system. Sincethen, convention officials admit another 87 tons of ivory _ thetusks of nearly 15,000 elephants _ have appeared in the nation.   The ban lobby is countered by well-funded traders, mostly basedin Hong Kong, who fear an end to a billion-dollar industry incarvings, jewelry and personalized name stamps used widely in Japan.   African elephants fall under the convention's Appendix Two forthreatened species. Controlled trade is allowed in that category.Shifting them to Appendix One, endangered species, would mean a ban.   Eugene Lapointe, secretary-general of the convention, hasrecommended a split-listing placing elephants on Appendix One butallowing those countries with controlled legal trade to continue.   He said a total ban might force some member countries to declarereservations, allowing them to bypass convention guidelines.   Western said he favors a ban but with accommodation for southernAfrica, under strict control. He is working on a method of tracingtusks based on genetic ``fingerprinting.''   But many specialists express concern that complex exceptionscould lead to the end of elephants in the wild.   Experts note the southern Africa group includes Mozambique andAngola, where lingering civil wars have decimated wildlife.Mozambican rebels and Zambian poachers frequently penetrate Zambianreserves.   Cynthia Moss, author of ``Elephant Memories,'' said, ``Zambia iswearing blinders. They cannot stop the poaching.''   Van Note testified before the U.S. Congress last year thatpoaching is rampant in parts of southern Africa. A few recentincidents suggest serious problems.   Last month, South African newspapers reported a plane thatcrashed on takeoff from an Angola rebel camp was overloaded withivory. The Portuguese pilot, Joaquim Augusto, owned a truck foundearlier in Namibia with 7 tons of tusks.   The plane was carrying three Portuguese legislators, includingJoao Soares, son of President Mario Soares, who had visited theheadquarters of the National Union for the Total Independence ofAngola, or UNITA. Soares was badly injured.   Last year, after U.S. groups accused Pretoria of helping UNITAfinance its rebellion by trafficking ivory, a South African boardof inquiry denied any large-scale military involvement. But theboard said the army did help UNITA transport tusks from 1976 to1979.   Two South African army officers were among six people indictedlast year in Connecticut on charges of smuggling rhino horn, skinsof endangered animals and assault rifles into the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
