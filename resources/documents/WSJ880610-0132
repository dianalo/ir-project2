A recent national survey by Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. suggests that it is. A whopping 39% of the small-business executives queried felt their companies had been hurt by &quot;questionable business practices,&quot; especially bribes, kickbacks, price collusion and conflicts of interest. The smaller the company, the higher the incidence; those with fewer than 25 employees were affected at twice the rate of those with over 300.    Analysts say that little companies are more subject to such transgressions for several reasons. For one, they don't have the legal responsibility of full disclosure that tends to keep large, publicly owned outfits in line. For another, they often lack a system of internal controls that would tend to make potential chiselers think twice.    In small businesses, people frequently get a broad range of authority, and can use it unethically with little risk. &quot;Sometimes key employees are the check and the balance, and so there's greater potential for wrongdoing,&quot; says Domenick Esposito, an assistant managing partner at Grant Thornton, the accounting firm.    Analysts also point out that while large companies have the resources to weather minor business setbacks, little ones frequently don't. This makes their owners particularly vulnerable to extortion by corrupt public officials. Prof. William Baxter of the Stanford Law School notes that for such owners, delayed building permits or failed sanitation inspections can be &quot;life-threatening events&quot; that make them cave in to bribe demands. By contrast, he adds, &quot;the local manager of Burger King is in a much better position&quot; to tell these people to get lost.    A good many small-business owners offer bribes, too, particularly when they are slugging it out with multiple competitors. A police investigation into Miami's cut-throat construction industry led to 24 bribery arrests last year, including some of the trade's most prominent local figures. &quot;A lot of people here believe this is just a cost of doing business,&quot; says Alex Ramirez, a police officer who posed as a building inspector to nab them.    An executive of a small, privately-owned food-processing company agrees that there is more sleaze in small business. This executive, who previously worked at big public companies, says most of the sleaze amounts to &quot;stupid stuff someone shouldn't jeopardize his job for,&quot; such as selling a used company car to a customer for a big discount.    But he thinks there is no point in tattling to the authorities about petty ethical breaches by a competitor. The amount involved is too small and the law too vague. Besides, he adds, &quot;you run the risk of putting yourself on the number-two list with other potential suppliers if they think you're going to wave the flag every time somebody leans on you.&quot;    Bob Kilpatrick, an adviser to minority small-business owners in the Los Angeles area, says that a little guy competing with a bigger firm may feel that he simply has to offer cash to get the business; he lacks the clout, and the access to the customer, that his competitor often has, and a bribe is his way of offsetting the disadvantage. &quot;His bigger competitor may play a better golf game,&quot; says Mr. Kilpatrick, &quot;or the competitor's wife may go to the same PTA meetings that the customer's wife goes to.&quot;    What to do? Accounting consultants advise small businessmen to adopt uniform, strictly enforced pricing and purchasing policies; to divide sensitive responsibilities (never let anyone writing checks do the bookkeeping, for example), and to draw up a code of ethics to be read and signed by all employees.    The experts also note that if small businesses have inherent weaknesses that make them more prone to ethical problems, they also have one strength that any owner-boss ought to capitalize on -- the intimacy that comes with a small operation. Mr. Esposito of Grant Thornton says: &quot;In these places the CEO is walking around the shop saying, 'How are we doing today?' instead of sitting, aloof, in corporate headquarters dictating memos about policy and procedures. The small-business man can come straight to his employees and say, 'Hey -- it's my integrity on the line here.'&quot;    ---   Mr. Allen is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Miami bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
