Introduction</ITAG>On August 25, 1988, EPA Region IV published a notice of the draft generalpermit (53 FR 32442) that is being issued in final form today. The Regionreceived materials from fourteen (14) commenters on the proposed permit,plus a request for an extension of the public comment period. On October25, 1988 (53 FR 43035), the public comment period was extended until November15, 1988. All the public comments received during this period are includedin the administrative record and were considered by Region IV in the formulationof a final determination of the conditions of today's final permit. TheRegion published a detailed fact sheet with the draft permit in 53 FR 32442.The Region is incorporating by reference that fact sheet and supplementaryinformation as part of the final fact sheet for today's final permit. Thediscussions presented in these sections should be consulted in reviewingthe applicability and scope of the final permit conditions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Other Legal Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirementsof Executive Order 12291 pursuant to Section 8[b] of that order. B. Paperwork Reduction ActEPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on the regulated facilities inthis final general permit under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>The information collection requirements of this permithave already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget in submissionsmade for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean WaterAct (hereafter, ``the Act'').C. State Certification RequirementsSection 301(b)(1)(c) of the Act requires that NPDES permits contain conditionswhich ensure compliance with applicable state water quality standards orlimitations. Under Section 401(a)(1) of the Act, EPA may not issue a NPDESpermit until the state in which the discharge will originate grants orwaives certification to ensure compliance with appropriate requirementsof the Act and state law. EPA requested certification of the permit onAugust 11, 1988. On June 14, 1989, the Florida Department of EnvironmentalRegulation waived certification of the general permit. D. Effective DateThe final NPDES general permit issued today is effective on July 17, 1989,and upon written notification of coverage from the Permit Issuing Authority.E. Regulatory Flexibility ActAfter review of the facts presented in this document, I hereby certify,pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this general NPDESpermit will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities. Moreover, the permit reduces a significant burden on regulatedsources. <ITAG tagnum="6">Lee A. DeHihns III, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Regional Administrator, Region IV.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>Appendix A_Public CommentsPublic notice of the draft permit was published at 53 FR 32442 (August25, 1988). The comment period was scheduled to close on September 25, 1988.Region IV received a request from the Florida Petroleum Council for anextension of public comment period, since the proposed draft raised issuesof potentially significant concern to the petroleum industry. The commentperiod was noticed at 53 FR 43035 (October 25, 1988) and extended untilthe close of business on November 15, 1988. Significant comments presentedduring the public comment periods were considered in the formulation ofa final decision regarding the proposed permit. The following parties responded with written comments on the general permit:Total Petroleum Inc., Kerr-McGee Corporation, Hopping Boyd Green andamp;Sams, Florida Petroleum Council, Chevron U.S.A. Inc., Shell Oil CompanyProfessor Richard L. Williamson, Jr., Florida Petroleum Marketers Association,Hunton andamp; Williams, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER),Kaiser Engineers, Conoco Inc., and the American Petroleum Institute. (1) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several industry commenters stated that the Region hasfailed to consider adequately the factors necessary to establish technology_basedeffluent limitations for benzene, lead, and napthalene. They mentionedthat there are no promulgated effluent guidelines applicable for thesepoint sources, therefore, this permit must necessarily establish technologybased effluent limitations on a site-by-site basis [40 CFR 125.3(c)(2)].Consequently, the Region must consider, inter alia, the ``engineering aspectsof the application of various types of control techniques and the costof achieving such effluent reductions.'' They stated that treating benzenecontaminated groundwater to 1.0 andCx.18;g/1 on a consistent basis wouldrequire optimal conditions to be met, and also mentioned that long termtreatment could amount to $1,000,000 or more per site. In some cases itmay be a technical impossibility to treat hydrocarbon contaminated groundwaterto trace levels in the aquifer, even if the most advanced technology currentlyavailable is used. <T3>Response: </T3>The Region agrees that optimal conditions for complyingwith the proposed benzene limit may not be available at every site. Eachoperator must consider which factors may prevent compliance with the proposedlimits before applying for coverage under the general permit. Other factors,such as iron and manganese levels above 5.0 mg/1 in the influent requirepolishing steps before using carbon absorption as a cleanup alternative.However, on individual permit requests, previous facilities were designedto meet a benzene limit of 1.0 andCx.18;g/1 by applying engineering techniquesto keep the influent to the airstripper at low concentrations before treatmentoccurred. Some facilities were using infiltration galleries and were inoperation before applying for an NPDES permit and were consistently meetingthe 1.0 andCx.18;g/1 effluent limitation for benzene from their treatmentfacilities prior to requesting a discharge permit to surface waters. Ifenormous costs could be verified after hydrogeologic consideration dueto a long term cleanup project, an individual permit might seem more appropriate;however, Chapter 17-70 of the State Underground Petroleum EnvironmentalResponse Program does provide flexibility with regard to costs and timeframe after a minimum of one year or less if data exist to verify thatthe cleanup remedial action is complete. The State of Florida would have the responsibility to make a determinationas to whether the remedial action operations would be deemed complete basedon concentrations found in the groundwater and consider the technical feasibilityof other proven groundwater techniques to further reduce contaminant levelsat the site. Therefore, compliance with the proposed limits of the generalpermit does not infer high cleanup costs, since FDER would verify whethera remediation plan is complete based on individual site data received fromthe operator. Even though airstripping independently does very little forremoval of leaded compounds in gasoline, airstripping plus other treatmentprocesses combined do reduce the lead levels enough to meet the permitlimit. Considering the amount of hydrocarbons recovered in the mobile freefloating phase and the high adsorption potential of organic leading compoundsonto the soils, treatment to comply with the lead limit has not raisedconcern at other facilities with individual permits. The technology beingused, even though not a lead removal technology, is able to reduce thelevels of leaded compounds. (2) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters mentioned that the proposed limitationsfor benzene, lead and naphthalene are more stringent than necessary tomeet applicable water quality standards. The commenters mentioned thatoutside of the mixing zone, Florida has established a general water qualitycriteria for lead of 50.0 andCx.18;g/l [FAC 17-3.061(2)(i)], yet the Regionproposed to establish end-of-pipe effluent limitations at the point ofdischarge of 30.0 andCx.18;g/l, apparently assuming that all discharges willbe to Class I Waters-Potable Water Supplies [FAC 17-3.091(16)] and thatthe drinking water intake pipe will be adjacent to the effluent discharge,a specifically prohibited practice [FAC 17-4.244(1)(d)]. It was statedthat the Florida Petroleum Council 1986 report entitled ``Benzene in FloridaGroundwater'' demonstrated that drinking water containing less than 25andCx.18;g/l of benzene would not contribute to leukemia. Commenters alsomentioned that 5.0 andCx.18;g/l is the U.S. EPA drinking water standard andthat the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation is proposing toset the benzene limit equal to EPA's standard. <T3>Response: </T3>The effluent limitations are technology-based and appliedat the end-of-pipe; therefore, a mixing zone is not granted under thisgeneral permit. On previous individual permit requests for cleanups ofthis type, the limits were applied at the end-of-pipe. Zones of mixingare granted on a case-by-case basis by FDER and will be considered in individualpermit issuances. The State of Florida had considered raising their standardto 5.0 andCx.18;g/l (MCL) for benzene in the drinking water, but these proposedlimits have not been finalized. The 1.0 andCx.18;g/l limit for benzene hasbeen proven to be technologically achievable, and is coincidentally betweenthe 10^\5\ and 10^\6\ risk levels of 6.6 andCx.18;g/l and 0.66 andCx.18;g/lfor increase in cancer over a lifetime (EPA 440/5-80-018); therefore, arevision upward is not justified. Also, as discussed in response to Comment(1), the level of influent concentrations by petroleum contamination tothe treatment system should be controlled by the operator, i.e., segregatingthe more concentrated contaminated groundwaters for product reclamationor off-site disposal. (3) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that the Region's proposedtoxicity limitations are both procedurally and substantively infirm andshould be used for information screening purposes only. They mentionedthe proposed toxicity limitation is more stringent than required underapplicable Florida water quality standards and that the subject State regulationprovides that the maximum concentration of wastes in the mixing zone shallnot exceed the amount lethal to 50% of the test organisms in 96 hours (96hr LC<T2>50</T2>) for a species significant to the indigenous aquatic community[FAC 17-4.244(4)(a)]. They mentioned the Region purports to equate the``effluent with the `mixing zone' and three appropriate test species witha species significant to the indigenous aquatic community'', an approachat odds with the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation. It wasalso mentioned that while this may be Agency policy, no substitute canexist for the exercise of informed decision making. CF NRDC v. EPA, No.80-1607 (D.C. Cir. 1988) slip op. at 64-65. <T3>Response: </T3>The ``Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Policy for Florida'',dated May 5, 1986, was developed by EPA, Region IV, for use in writingNPDES permits in Florida. Our requirements, procedures and methods do nothave to correspond with those required by the FDER. After consideration of comments received regarding the toxicity requirement,the language in this permit has been revised to allow additional confirmatorytesting if the toxicity tests fail. These additional toxicity tests willbe used to determine if coverage by the general permit should continueor if an individual permit will be required. Failure of the tests doesnot constitute a permit violation. The use of non-indigenous species forstandard laboratory toxicity is consistent with EPA's Technical SupportDocument and the final report of the Bioassay Task Force Report of August1985, by the FDER. This report recommended that ``standard stock monoculturesof known health and sensitivity must be used in testing.'' In interpretingthe meaning of the use of organisms significant to the indigenous aquaticcommunity, this has been interpreted by FDER as meaning ``any recognizedorganisms can be used for bioassay testing as long as that organism isknown to be sensitive to toxic substances that can be expected to impactthe indigenous community'', (page 6, Final Report_Bioassay Task Force).With regard to allowance of a mixing zone under Florida's standards, thesedischarges do not have approved mixing zones. In the absence of a mixingzone, the least stringent rule [17-4.244(4)], which prohibits wastes atthe point of discharge from exceeding the 96 hour LC<T2>50 </T2>(LC<T2>50</T2> andgreater; 100%), applies at the end-of-pipe (page 5, FinalReport of the Bioassay Task Force).(4) <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters stated that EPA lacks the authority torequire development of a Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan. The CleanWater Act (CWA) empowers EPA to include such requirements in an NPDES permitonly if it has published industry-specific BMP regulations and, even then,only after making certain specified regulatory determinations. Since EPAhas yet to promulgate requirements applicable to these discharges, it iswithout the statutory authority to impose them in the general permit. In<T3>NRDC</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, industry petitioners, including API challenged EPA's authorityunder sections 125.100 and 125.103 to include BMPs in NPDES permits ona case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1). In a <T3>Settlement Agreement </T3>dated June 7, 1982, the parties agreed thatthe BMP issue was not ripe for adjudication because EPA had suspended theeffectiveness of its BMP regulations pending further review, and the BMPissue was dismissed on the ripeness ground on August 6, 1982. Pursuantto the <T3>Settlement Agreement, </T3>the industry petitioners reserve the rightto challenge any new BMP regulations which may be promulgated. Many ofthe same concerns would be addressed in the applicable Site Remedial ActionPlan.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 402(a)(2) of the Act and the implementing regulationsat 40 CFR 122.43(a) authorize EPA to require Best Management PracticesPlans in NPDES permits. <T3>Decision of the General Counsel, </T3>No. 72, Issue VI. The permitrequires that the BMP plan be prepared in conjunction with the Site RemedialAction Plan.(5) <T3>Comment: </T3>An industry commenter stated that the separate authorizationto combine contaminated groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tankswith contaminated groundwater from the sites recovery well should be deleted.<T3>Response: </T3>The Region did not intend to construe this as a separatepermit requirement, but could be included in the notification stages whenthe facility will be combining discharges. This would give the Region anaccurate account of facilities that would actually be using these treatmentprocesses to treat the storage tank bottom waters. This can be handledin the Notice of Intent (NOI) which is required by EPA for the permitteeto be covered under the general permit.(6) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters mentioned that as long as the permitteeis meeting the effluent limits, the one-time analysis of the effluent forpriority pollutants appears to be unnecessary.<T3>Response: </T3>This one-time scan was incorporated into the generalpermit to check the treatment facilities' performance near the start ofoperation for the reduction of other priority pollutants which are alsodischarged. It is the Region's view that if the treatment efficiency isadequate in the initial cleanup operations, the effluent quality in thelater stages of cleanup operations should not deteriorate as the cleanupoperations progress and the groundwater quality is restored.(7) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that since these are technologybased limits, if an ``upset'' occurs, it necessarily follows that it shouldbe possible to raise that defense to any permit violation. They recommendeddeleting the water-quality qualifier which appears to limit unnecessarilythe availability of the upset defense in this setting.<T3>Response: </T3>The Region agrees that this statement should not beincluded and it has been deleted in the final issuance of the general permit.(8) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that it was unnecessary for generalpermittees to receive permission from EPA to deactivate coverage underthe general permit.<T3>Response: </T3>The language in the permit has been clarified to statethat EPA will inactivate coverage by the general permit after review ofsite closure documentation.(9) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the 30 andCx.18;g/l effluentlimit imposed for lead would not necessarily in all circumstances protecthuman health. The EPA 440/5-80-057 Ambient Water Criteria document forlead is obsolete, since EPA Headquarters has proposed a new drinking waterstandard for lead which contains an impressive array of health informationof 5.0 andCx.18;g/l (53 FR 31565, August 18, 1988). Past practice for Floridais to keep the water quality criteria for lead well below the federal standard;therefore, anticipation can be made that the State will lower their standards.If the State of Florida imposes this 5.0 andCx.18;g/l for lead, this wouldbe measured outside the mixing zone after dilution has been taken intoaccount. For example, with a dilution of 5:1, the effluent could have aconcentration of 30 andCx.18;g/l and still not exceed the new water qualitystandard.The general permit should be more stringent than individual permits basedon reasonable worst case, yet, nowhere is the general permit dischargelimited to those with substantial low flow or to conditions where thereare ambient background levels of lead. This would result in the instreamconcentration of 5.0 andCx.18;g/l to be exceeded. The lead limit of 30.0andCx.18;g/l will not protect freshwater organisms. The current documentsinclude values that would protect organisms themselves. For some substances,including lead, the value for the protection of aquatic organisms couldbe more stringent than human health, particularly in streams with verylow hardness (7.7 andCx.18;g/l at a hardness of 200 andCx.18;g/l). The effluentlimit will not be protective of aquatic organisms in streams with low flowsand/or high background levels. It was recommended that a one-time prioritypollutant scan be used to ensure the treated water did not contain anytoxic pollutants. Also, that a more frequent sampling be imposed in thepermit if a failure does occur during toxicity testing to determine ifthe limit is being maintained using a larger data base and this permitviolation would trigger applying for an individual NPDES permit.<T3>Response: </T3>This general permit was not written to consider existingor proposed drinking water standards by any regulatory agency. The testingrequirement for lead is currently being required by the State of Floridafor the groundwater at sites which do not satisfy the ``no further action''or ``monitoring only'' alternative. With regard to toxicity testing, theRegion has revised the toxicity testing requirement based on significantcomments received on the draft general permit. The Regional toxicity testingrequirements still supports the use of organisms significant to the indigenousaquatic community as mentioned in the response to Comment (3); however,additional tests will be required to support continuance or revocationof coverage under the general permit. Part II, Section G. does provideexclusion of coverage under the general permit, if a permittee proposesa discharge to receiving waters that are classified as ``Special Protection,Outstanding Florida Waters.'' A priority pollutant scan is included intoPart I B. of the general permit.(10) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended a reduction from the threeto two species for use in toxicity tests. Also, language should be includedin the permit to clarify that these operations must also meet the approvalof Florida prior to receipt of NPDES general permit coverage.<T3>Response: </T3>The recommendation for a reduction from the proposedthree (3) species for toxicity testing to the two (2) species was incorporatedinto the conditions of the final permit. Language was included into thenotification stages of the final permit to indicate that these facilitiesmust also obtain approval from the State of Florida prior to attainingcoverage under the NPDES general permit.(11) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the proposed limits fora pH range of 6.0-8.5 should be dropped since the limits are unrealisticfor Florida and natural groundwater often measures in the 4.0-6.0 rangefor pH.<T3>Response: </T3>On previous individual permits issued the pH range of6.0-8.5 was required and actual operating data indicate that some facilitiesare operating within this range; therefore, deletion of this pH range isnot justified.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Other Changes to Final Permit</ITAG>After review of the proposed permit, Region IV incorporated other changesinto the final permit that are part of today's final issued permit.(1) In Part I, Section D, the schedule of compliance was changed to reflectoperational level attainment dates for permittees with revoked individualpermits and new dischargers.(2) In Part II, Section A.2, revised language was incorporated into thepermit for penalties for violations of permit conditions, in accordancewith the Water Quality Act of 1987.(3) In Part II, Section F, language was included to allow coverage underthe general permit for permittees during initial cleanup operations whenInitial Remedial Actions (IRA) have been approved by Florida Departmentof Environmental Regulation, or if a Site Rehabilitation Initiation Orderhas been approved.(4) In Part IV of the Best Management Practices (BMP) plan, language wasadded to insure that the plan is maintained at the facility and made availableupon request from the Permit Issuing Authority.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix B_General Permit To Discharge Under the National PollutantDischarge Elimination System</ITAG>In compliance with the provisions of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33U.S.C. 1251 et seq.; the ``Act''),Discharges of treated groundwater and stormwater incidental to groundwatercleanup operations which are contaminated with gasoline or aviation fuelare authorized to discharge to waters of the United States within the Stateof Florida in accordance with effluent limitations, monitoring requirementsand other conditions set forth herein.

If the effluent is discharged to a <T3>freshwater stream</T3>, the permittee shall conduct 48-hour statictoxicity tests on two appropriate test species (EPA/600/4-85/013, Table1). The test organisms used shall include one fish and one invertebratetest species (Recommend: A Daphnidae species and the fathead minnow (<T3>Pimephales promelas</T3>). If the effluent is discharged to a <T3>saltwater stream</T3>, the permittee shall conduct 48-hour static toxicitytests using the Mysid shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia) and the inland silverside(Menidia beryllina) or any other species approved by EPA. Tests shall beconducted once every month for a period of three months following the initiationof the tests and once every year thereafter for the duration of the permitusing samples of 100% final effluent. Such tests will be conducted on onegrab sample of 100% final effluent. Results of all tests conducted withany species shall be reported according to EPA/600/4-85/013, Section 13,Report Preparation and Data Utilization, and shall be submitted to EPAwith the quarterly discharge monitoring report. 2. If lethality (less than 50% survival of tests organisms in 100% effluent)is demonstrated in either of the above test(s), another 48-hr static testusing the same specie(s) and the same methodology shall be conducted withintwo weeks. If the additional test(s) indicates toxicity, coverage underthe general permit may be revoked by the Permit Issuing Authority uponissuance of an individual permit. 3. All test organisms, procedures and quality assurance criteria used shallbe in accordance with <T3>Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluent to Freshwaterand Marine Organisms, </T3>EPA-600/4-85-013. A standard reference toxicantquality assurance test shall be conducted concurrently with each set oftoxicity tests and its results submitted with the quarterly discharge monitoringreport. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-16685 Filed 7-14-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
