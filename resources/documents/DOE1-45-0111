This technique was used to studythe nature and time course of {sup 75}Se incorporation into selenoproteins.Male weanling rats were fed either a Se-adequate (0.35 ppm Se) or a Se-deficient(less than 0.02 ppm Se) diet for 20-41 days, injected iv with 50 microCi[{sup 75}Se]selenite (100 microCi/micrograms Se), and sacrificed 1, 3,24, or 72 hr after {sup 75}Se injection. At 1 and 3 hr, a 55-kDa plasma{sup 75}Se protein contained the most {sup 75}Se of any {sup 75}Se proteinobserved in any tissue in either Se-adequate or Se-deficient rats. At24 and 72 hr, a 23-kDa {sup 75}Se protein (glutathione peroxidase subunit)in liver cytosol was the second-most labeled {sup 75}Se protein observedin Se-adequate rats. The second-most labeled {sup 75}Se protein in Se-deficientrats was a 17-kDa {sup 75}Se protein in testes at 24 and 72 hr. {sup75}Se proteins of 10, 14, 45, and 65 kDa as well as lesser amounts ofother {sup 75}Se proteins were also detected. In a separate experiment,cycloheximide pretreatment eliminated {sup 75}Se labeling of any of the{sup 75}Se proteins, demonstrating that protein synthesis is requiredfor Se incorporation. The rise and fall of various {sup 75}Se proteinswith time suggests that these seleno-proteins may be important in theflux of Se between tissues.</TEXT></DOC>
