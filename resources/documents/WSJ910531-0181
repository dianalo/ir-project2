The two companies have been hoping to unveil a newpartnership at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show, startingtomorrow in Chicago, but it isn't certain they will reach anagreement in time.</LP><TEXT>   If the two are able to agree on such an alliance, the newmedium would be an important new weapon for Nintendo, theworld's leading computer-game maker. Its sales of gamecartridges and machines are tapering off in the crucial U.S.market after five years of stunning growth, and some analystsspeculate that the company's recently unveiledsecond-generation machines aren't different enough torecharge the business.   Meanwhile, Philips, one of the main developers of compactdisks, would get an important ally in the emerging battleover standards for the increasingly popular CDs. The pactwould be &quot;a further step in achieving world-wide standardsfor CD-based products,&quot; an unreleased preliminary draft of anannouncement quotes Philips as saying.   According to the draft, the two companies are discussing aplan for Philips to grant Nintendo a license to use CDs forgames. The draft says the CD equipment could be attached toNintendo's previously announced advanced machines, whichstill run games on cartridges and which will go on sale inthe U.S. in September as the Super Nintendo EntertainmentSystem.   Spokesmen for Nintendo of Japan and Philips of theNetherlands refused to confirm or deny the negotiations.   Nintendo currently sells games that are stored oncartridges with electronic memory. Some industry officialsclaim that CDs have as much as 2,000 times more storagespace. That means games could use real voices and real video,as opposed to the current lower-quality computer simulationsounds and drawings.   By coming out with a CD-based machine, Nintendo would befollowing competitors such as NEC corp., which has beenselling the technology in Japan since 1988, and in the U.S.since 1989. But analysts said only Nintendo, which has morethan 80% of the home-computer game market, has the power toset a CD-game standard and popularize the medium.
