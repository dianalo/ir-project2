Next month, the closely held engineering and construction company will begin taking down the Tullnerfeld plant, which stands in rich farming country near the town of Zwentendorf, Austria, some 30 miles northwest of Vienna. The $645 million, West German-built reactor has been lying dormant on the banks of the Danube since its completion nine years ago, the victim of a public referendum to close the facility before it ever opened.    The precedent-setting decision to scrap the plant by its owners, Gemeinschaftskraftwerk Tullnerfeld G.m.b.)H, or GKT, may embolden U.S. opponents of nuclear power who are battling the federal government and utilities over the proposed full start-up of plants at Shoreham, N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H. The Tullnerfeld dismantling also shows the complexity of taking down facilities that require years to construct.    GKT, a government-owned utility, isn't expected to recover a significant percentage of its original investment in Tullnerfeld, which took six years to build. But a Bechtel spokesman said dismantling the facility was the only way for the utility to obtain &quot;some recovery.&quot; The spokesman said Bechtel plans to remove less than half the plant's equipment for resale to other utilities and heavy industrial companies, and leave the unmarketable parts inside the plant's structures for possible alternative uses later on.    Bechtel said the most common items to be removed for resale include such things as valves, pumps, vessels and electrical equipment. In particular, said the spokesman, emergency diesel generators are expected to be &quot;a hot item.&quot; Industry sources estimated that GKT will receive $20 million to $30 million from resale of the parts. Bechtel declined to disclose its fee for dismantling the plant.    In the U.S., energy-policy experts and opponents of nuclear power said the Tullnerfeld breakup may shed light on the unknown costs and complexities of abandoning other completed, controversial plants. Most notably, the Seabrook nuclear reactor in New Hampshire is awaiting federal approval for low-level testing, but local towns and the government of neighboring Massachusetts have thus far stymied the plant's final licensing by refusing to participate in emergency evacuation plans.    &quot;We're not at that (dismantling) point yet, but the fact that somebody else is doing it may provide an example to follow,&quot; said Gillian Gansler, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis favors converting Seabrook to a coal or natural gas plant.    Added William Davis, executive deputy commissioner of energy for New York state, which opposes full operation of the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island: &quot;This move by Bechtel in Austria should establish some baseline for people to learn a hell of a lot more about what abandonment means.&quot; The Shoreham plant is currently being tested at 5% power. </TEXT></DOC>
