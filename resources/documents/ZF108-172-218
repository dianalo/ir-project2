McGowan sounded, anyway.andM;McGowan credits telecommunications for the massive political change sweepingacross the globe.andP;  &quot;Global communications are the driving force behind manyof the revolutionary changes we're witnessing around the world today,&quot; the PRNewswire quoted him as saying early this winter.andM;The United States, he said, should encourage the use of communicationstechnologies to spur economic growth and open access to foreign markets.andO;Call us skeptical, but we can't help wondering whose economic growth MCI andMcGowan are most interested in.andM;Workers of the World,andM;Where Are You?andM;Now's the time to look for a job in high tech.andM;According to a study commissioned by Congress, the United States faces adrastic shortage of technically skilled workers, unless American collegesturn out twice as many white women in science and engineering, five times asmany blacks, and seven times as many Hispanics.andM;The figures were derived by combining numbers from the National ScienceFoundation, which foresees a shortfall of 560,000 scientists and engineers bythe year 2010, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which projects that 85percent of new workers in the year 2000 will be women and minorities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
