(program)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LettersandM;More sparks from MayandM;Sir,andM;In response to the Soapbox article in July's edition of .EXE, I would like toexpand on several points already raised by Jules May.andM;First, he mentions the problem with releasing memory prematurely with theconsequence of the operating system crashing.andP;  He has obviously only usedMS-DOS, which may be perfectly adequate for his purposes, but cannot reallybe classed as a real operating system.andP;  Any sensible OS, such as OS/2, UNIXetc, has a built-in memory management system with virtual memory which makesoperating systems extremely difficult to crash, if not impossible.andM;Second, Mr May discusses the point of producing portable code when accessinghardware.andP;  C is extremely portable as long as the code only calls thestandard library routines.andP;  It must be obvious that any hardware dependantpiece of code is virtually impossible to port.andP;  An example of thisnonportability is the hardware access on an 80x86 CPU which must be performedwith IN and OUT instructions, where a 680x0 processor will have the samehardware memory mapped.andM;My final point is the statement 'In 10 years of programming he has onlyproduced one bug'.andP;  I can only say that us mere mortals would like to meetthis programming god!andM;Mr May's programs must be extremely simple or else in his 10 years ofprogramming he has yet to release a version to an over anxious customer.andM;Mr A Goodwin Tewkesbury GlosandM;Sir,andM;I felt I had to reply to the utterly stupid comments put forward by Mr May.andO;He states that it is impossible to write a clean program in C, well how'sabout this.andP;  (Mr Moles quoted the 'Hello World' program here-Ed.)andP;  I'm sureany C programmer out there will confirm that this will compile cleanly on anyC compiler be it DOS, UNIX, VMS etc.andM;This short program also disproves Mr May's theory that you don't have anychoice but to work low-level in C.andP;  It simply passes the phrase 'Hello,world' to the operating system for output - nothing low-level in that.andM;A program such as lint, which tells you what you have done that is dangerous,does not put down the language.andP;  If anything, it puts down the compiler.andM;And finally, I don't know where Mr May gets his facts from, but I would justlike to say this: Yes!andP;  C is capable of producing inherently portable code,that is one of the main beauties of the language!andP;  Don't forget, Mr May, Cwas originally written for UNIX systems where every program has to bemodified to work on each individual machine.andM;Might I also recommend that you read 'C - A Complete Reference' by Kernighanandamp; Ritchie, it might help you get your facts straight.andM;PS: What language do you program in Mr May?andP;  BASIC?andM;Jamie J Moles Slough BerkshireandM;Jules May was on the receiving end of a lot of flak here, so we gave him theright of reply:andM;'I have got my facts straight - I have used over a dozen different Ccompilers, on systems ranging from UNIX to embedded ROM monitors.andP;  I agreeMS-DOS is much easier to crash than UNIX (though UNIX is far from impossibleto crash), but it is unrealistic to claim it is not a real system - too manymachines run it, and it must be supported.andP;  OK, so a program that crashesMS-DOS may just die quietly on UNIX; is this supposed to make the programmore reliable?andP;  It doesn't make me feel any more confident, I'm afraid.andM;'How does one force programmers to use only the standard libraries?andP;  Come tothink of it, I've never seen a real program that did, and with good reason -the standard libraries are too crude.andP;  It is obvious that hardware dependantcode is difficult to port, so why make such features so accessible that theyare invigsible in real code - they should stand out like sore thumbs!andP;  I'msorr, you can't have it both ways.andM;'Mr Moles offers a program he guarantees is clean.andP;  Well, you're going tomake a fortune writing programs like that!andP;  Now write a flight automationsyste, a life-support system, or a process control system for an oilrefinery.andP;  Can you be as certain of these?andP;  Anyone can be a smartass.andM;'I am sarcastically called a god, because I have developed tools anddisciplines to catch all my errors before they go into production programs.andO;Then I am told that I should learn to program properly, because Mr Moles getsby just fine without them.andP;  What is going on here?andP;  For the record, MrGoodwin, my solitary bug appeared in a 25,000 line program which I wrote in amonth.andP;  Did I program in BASIC?andP;  Ha!andP;  You don't listen, Mr Moles, there is nobest language; and no, I have never released a half-finished program, nomatter how vociferous the customer.'andM;Pop pickerandM;Sir,andM;Trying, to reach the update desk at Microsoft took me a total of 18 minuteson the 27th June.andP;  Is this a record?andP;  I heard the message 'Our staff arestill engaged, your call will be answeed by the first available person' atotal of 27 times.andP;  I do wish they would change the music - I could havelistened to a Vivaldi concerto in the time - then it wouldn't have felt likesuch a complete waste of time Peter F Chapman Energy Advisory Services LtdHanslopeandM;Pascal correctionandM;Sir,andM;I am writing in response to the article &quot;Turbo Pascal OOP Text Windows&quot; inthe July 1990 issue.andP;  First, I was amazed that the writer David Bolton hadnot stripped out the linked list of windows as another object.andP;  After all,one of the strengths of objects lies in their reuseability, and here is Davidignoring the perfectly good linked list object given away free by Borland (inOBJECTS.PAS, ODEMO.PAS, etc).andP;  Hence he has to re-invent the linked list'wheel' and, furthermore, make it part of a general window object, where itdefinitely does not belong.andM;Second, the rather snide remark inthe last paragraph about finding a TurboPascal compiler bug due to the 'strict pointer type checking [being] just toostrict' just illustrates that David has not checked out the example codeprovided by Borland.andP;  Rather than the chunky method he uses, the reader isintroduced to type-casting pointers:andM;Temp := ColWindPtr (Temp[and].Over);andM;Admittedly, Borland did warn its Turbo Pascal users very well about the needfor type-casting in Object Oriented programming (a quick flip through the TPOOP Guide did not bring up any references to it) but numerous magazinearticles within Dr Doods, Programmers Journal, etc have shown themethodology.andM;Finally, I would like to recommend to David and your other OOP readers theObject Professional package from Turbo Power Software (available from GreyMatter) - no, I am not linked with them!andP;  The depth of information is quiteamazing (with three manuals and 10 MB of code it is not surprising); I amstill finding out new methods/functionality six months later.andP;  The sourcecode to this library, more than anything else, has taught me about OOP; howthey have implemented their linked windows is quite instructive.andM;Julian Bucknall Hammersmith LondonandM;Object Professional is reviewed elsewhere in this issue.andM;Article unscramblerandM;Sir,andM;The article in July's .EXE Program Structures of the Fourth Kind holds adeeper meaning than that apparently exhibited.andP;  After an initial perusal, Ifelt that somehow the author was hinting at a more profound statement.andP;  Afterattempting a third pass at the article, the whole truth was apparent.andP;  Yes,to emphasise his basic argument, and as an example of the situation thatoften faces programmers using high-level languages, the article was printedin structured blocks, in completely the wrong sequence.andP;  The pseudo code inFigure 1 may help others to follow the thread.andM;Yours in sequence, with constant iteration.andM;Chris Luvaglia Pharmacia LKB Biochrom Ltd</TEXT></DOC>
