The Massachusetts governor for the first time Tuesday found amajority of his backers supporting him strongly, the polls said.Dukakis, whose margin of victory was better than 2-1, won everygroup but blacks, who favored Jackson almost unanimously.   Still, two-thirds of Jackson's voters said they would supportDukakis as the nominee against George Bush in November, an ABCNews-Washington Post poll said. And a CBS News-New York Times pollsaid 58 percent of Jackson's backers expressed a favorable view ofDukakis.   ``If I were in Dukakis' campaign I'd be jumping for joy,'' saidCBS News pollster Keating Holland. ``He's going to have a good,strong candidacy. He's not going to be a default candidate by anymeans.''   While many Jackson voters showed a willingness to supportDukakis, so did Democrats at the other end of the spectrum, thosewho voted for President Reagan in 1984. Two-thirds of them in theCBS-Times poll, and three-quarters in the ABC-Post poll, said theywould back Dukakis over Bush in November.   ``What we're seeing here is Dukakis showing an ability to pulltogether the Democratic electorate,'' said ABC poll analyst DougMuzzio. ``He's bringing Democrats back home from Reagan. And eventhough the electorate is bifurcated he's showing an ability to pullJackson's supporters to him for November.''   The Democratic electorate still was divided sharply along raciallines, with Jackson drawing support from about 95 percent of theblacks and less than 15 percent of the whites. His share of thewhite vote was well under the 20-percent-plus range he reached inWisconsin, Connecticut and Vermont.   Dukakis backers were wary of Jackson. In the CBS-Times poll 59percent of them viewed Jackson unfavorably, and in the ABC-Postpoll only 24 percent of Dukakis voters said they would supportJackson as the nominee against Bush. Forty-three percent favoredBush and 33 percent said they would not vote.   In another measure, an NBC News exit poll found white Democratssplit on whether Jackson's candidacy was good for the party.Thirty-six percent said Jackson helped the party by running and 36percent said he hurt it.   ``Dukakis has to be very careful about embracing Jackson becausehe's got a lot of people who don't like him,'' said I.A. Lewis,pollster for The Los Angeles Times. ``Dukakis has a tightrope he'swalking here. ... He has to be careful _ not because of the blacks,but because of his own supporters.''   Whatever his future problems, pollsters said, Dukakis' newfoundstrength was a striking feature of the Pennsylvania vote. TheCBS-Times poll found that 52 percent of his voters said they backedhim strongly, the first time more than half his support was strong.   While one-fifth of Dukakis voters said they were backing himchiefly to stop Jackson, that was well down from one-third in theNew York primary last week, the ABC-Post poll said. And it saidDukakis had moved in for the first time on some of Jackson's issues.   Dukakis won half the voters who cited the poor and elderly astheir chief concerns, groups that Jackson won strongly in earliercontests, Muzzio said. Dukakis also edged Jackson among voters whocited strong leadership and ability to make a change, groups thatJackson usually won previously.   ``Dukakis is consolidating his support and it's coalescing. He'smoving into Jackson issues,'' Muzzio said. ``He's making ratherdramatic inroads into issues of concern to what had been Jacksonvoters.''   NBC's poll said 80 percent of Democrats think Dukakis will bethe party's nominee, and even 49 percent of Jackson voters expectDukakis to win. In all, roughly three-quarters of Democrats saidthey viewed Dukakis favorably.   ``He's emerging as the consensus candidate,'' Lewis said. ``Thenext step is going to be binding the wounds, pulling the partytogether and getting it directed against the Republicans.''   The NBC and CBS-Times polls had a margin of sampling error of 2points; the ABC-Post poll, 3 points.</TEXT></DOC>
