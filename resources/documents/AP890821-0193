Dr. James Mold, for one, still makes house calls to elderlypatients and says he finds them useful and, in fact, enjoyable.   ``There are a variety of reasons physicians still make them,''says Mold, assistant professor of family medicine and director ofthe geriatrics program at the University of Oklahoma Health SciencesCenter. ``One reason I make house calls is that they allow me to getto know patients in a way I can't during a regular office call.''   Mold says that the home setting often alerts him to problems likeoveruse of medication or alcohol abuse _ things he might miss duringan office appointment.   ``With geriatric patients, how they function is often much moreimportant than diagnosing disease,'' he says. ``The place wherepeople function is in their home, so it's crucial in some cases thatyou actually see what the person is dealing with.''   Mold says the home setting is more relaxing and reassuring to thepatient, and he often can get a more accurate blood pressure reading.   But the negative side has to be considered, too, he says. Thedoctor can't rely on staff and equipment backup that he has at hisoffice. There also is the cost, which isn't covered by fees.   Despite these drawbacks, he predicts that a doctors will makemore house calls in the future, owing to the greater number of olderpeople and to the interest in home health care to shorten hospitalstays. Doctors probably will be working closely with home careagencies, he says.   Patients who are too frail to make trips to the office or don'thave transportation shouldn't hesitate to ask their doctors to cometo them, he adds.   ``Personally, I find house calls very enjoyable. I feel morecomfortable, and the patients feel more comfortable,'' he says.``People are appreciative when I take the time to come out, andeveryone likes to be appreciated.''</TEXT></DOC>
