Guerrilla reports said 45 to 90 insurgents died in the battle forthe city, the target of some of the heaviest fighting in thedecade-long Afghan civil war.   Soviet television reported that the Afghan army claimed 14,000guerrillas backed by 3,000 Pakistani advisers took part in theattack.   Afghanistan's Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 386guerrillas and 36 ``foreign advisers'' were killed. The officialSoviet news agency Tass said 380 guerrillas and 11 Afghan soldierswere killed.   Radio Kabul said civilian and government casualties from therocketing were slight. It gave no total count.   The broadcast said two Pakistani helicopters landed outsideJalalabad on Saturday and unloaded weapons and ``foreign advisers''before heading back home.   Official spokesmen in the United States and Pakistan have deniedsending their nationals to the country, where U.S.- andPakistani-backed Moslem guerrillas are battling a communistgovernment.   The Soviet television report, based on an Afghan army newsconference, said Jalalabad was not out of danger even though theattack had been turned back. ``Judging by everything, the Pakistanimilitary circles, which sent more than 3,000 of their advisers here,will try to do everything in their power to capture Jalalabad,'' itsaid.   Also Sunday, the Communist Party daily Pravda reported thatAfghan guerrillas fired on Soviet border guards in the Sovietrepublic of Tadzhikistan.   The newspaper claimed the culprits were connected with Pakistan,but it did not say when the incident occurred or if anyone wasinjured.   The Soviet Union ended nine years of military intervention inAfghanistan on Feb. 15, when the last of its 115,000 soldiers whohad been sent into the country left.   That left the Afghan government alone to fight the guerrillas,who have vowed to take power.   Jalalabad is Afghanistan's fifth-largest city and is 40 mileswest of the Pakistan border, on the main highway between Pakistanand the Afghan capital, Kabul.   Guerrillas say the city's fall will signal the early demise ofthe ruling communists.   Thousands of the guerrillas have been moving toward Jalalabadfrom Pakistan to join the offensive. The Afghan government says3,100 guerrillas have died in fighting around Jalalabad, accordingto Radio Kabul.   Much of the fighting has been concentrated around Jalalabad'sairport, which guerrilla sources say remains in government hands.   Before fighting began, guerrillas warned civilians and governmentmilitia troops living in Jalalabad of the offensive and urged themto evacuate, said Mohammad Shoaib, a spokesman for theJamiat-i-Islami rebel group.   Western journalists returning to Pakistan from near Jalalabadsaid residents have started to evacuate the city.   Reports from Peshawar quoted one aid worker as saying as many as15,000 Afghans were on the move, most of them on foot and takingtheir livestock with them, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.   A moderate rebel group called the National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan said it captured 500 Afghan soldiers and officers fromthe key garrison of Samarkhiel on the outskirts of Jalalabad. Somewere paraded before journalists Sunday at a rebel camp outsidePeshawar.   In London, the BBC reported Sunday that the Soviet Union hascarried out its first airlift of food to Kabul since the withdrawalof Soviet troops.   The BBC quoted an unidentified Afghan spokesman as saying twoSoviet transport planes took in 10 tons of flour each.   Also Sunday, the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said guerrillasshot down a government fighter jet, killing everyone aboard. It gaveno further details and there was no way to independently confirm thereport.</TEXT></DOC>
