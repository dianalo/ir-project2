(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Discovery and its five crewmen waitedout bad weather and thundered into orbit today to deploy a $100million satellite that completes a network giving astronauts almostunbroken radio contact with Earth.   The 113-ton winged spaceship, also carrying four crippled whiterats and 32 chicken eggs among its scientific experiments, vaultedoff its seaside launch pad into a cloudless sky at 9:57 a.m. EST.Liftoff was delayed one hour and 50 minutes to allow fog to burn offand NASA computers to adjust the shuttle's path to compensate forshifting high-altitude winds.   NASA reported 8{ minutes after liftoff that Discovery hadachieved a successful orbit 180 miles above the Earth.   ``All systems are clean as a whistle,'' Mission Controlcommentator Brian Welch reported from Houston.   The flight, postponed for nearly a month by mechanical faults, isthe third since the Challenger disaster more than three years agoand starts NASA on an ambitious schedule calling for seven shuttlelaunches in 1989.   ``It's a great start to a long launch season,'' launch directorBob Sieck told a news conference. He said that except for theweather, the countdown was virtually fault-free.   A 700-foot geyser of flame trailed the $1.5 billion craft as itrolled onto its desired course and sped toward orbit.   More than 45,000 people jammed viewing areas along nearbybeaches, roads and river banks to watch the blazing departure of the28th space shuttle flight.   Two minutes and six seconds after liftoff, the flight passed acritical milestone when the two solid fuel booster rockets burnedout and jettisoned on schedule into the Atlantic Ocean. The failureof a booster rocket joint led to the loss of Challenger and itsseven-person crew.   Six hours into the flight, the astronauts were to perform themain task of the mission _ deploying the 2{-ton Tracking and DataRelay Satellite. It then was to be carried by its own rocket to a22,300-mile-high orbit to join two older satellites and complete anorbiting network essential for communicating with future spaceshuttles and with science and military satellites.   With the new satellite operational, Mission Control will be ableto communicate with an orbiting shuttle 85 percent of the time, incontrast with the old system of ground stations which provided only15 percent coverage. NASA plans to shut six of those ground stationsat a monthly savings of $3 million.   Immediately on reaching orbit, commander Michael L. Coats pitchedthe shuttle's nose down so crewmate Dr. James M. Bagian couldphotograph the 154-foot-tall external fuel tank as it drifted awaytoward a breakup over the Indian Ocean.   On the last shuttle mission, Atlantis' thermal tiles wereseverely damaged by insulation that stripped off the tank after itwas hit by debris that fell off one of the solid fuel boosterrockets.   Modifications were made to correct the problem, and today'sphotographs should show if any more insulation came off.   ``Jim got some real good pictures of the tank from the overhead''window, Coats reported. ``We can see it real well.''   Coats and his crew were awakened at 3:16 a.m. and, in a surprise,showed up for breakfast wearing business suits and ties. Fine chinaand candles adorned the table for the steak and eggs feast.   Wearing the suits instead of the normal casual wear apparentlywas a tongue-in-cheek response to word that NASA was trying to curbastronauts' penchant for fun. Officials reportedly were annoyed by atelevised show two missions ago when the crew floated through theshuttle cabin wearing colorful Hawaiian shirts.   Flying with Coats, a 43-year-old Navy captain, are Air Force Col.John E. Blaha, 46, the pilot; Marine Cols. James F. Buchli, 43, andRobert C. Springer, 46, and Bagian, 36, a physician. Coats andBuchli have flown on previous shuttle flights.   Discovery originally was set for liftoff Feb. 18, but the launchwas postponed four times by the need to replace faulty or suspectengine parts.   Shuttle chief Richard Truly said the success of this mission is``absolutely vital'' to NASA's continued recovery from theChallenger accident and the agency's move toward safe, routine,once-a-month shuttle launches by 1992.   Following the flight, the 1989 shuttle schedule lists the launchof the Magellan probe to Venus in April, secret Defense Departmentpayloads in July and August, the Galileo mission to Jupiter inOctober, a communications satellite in November and the Hubble SpaceTelescope in December.   Coats said the first two post-Challenger flights _ by Discoveryin September and Atlantis in December _ ``were important to showthat we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe.   ``The next step,'' Coats said, ``is to prove we can do it on aregular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to showwe're a space-faring nation again.''   The mission is filled with scientific experiments. The rats, withchips of bone cut from their legs, are to be studied to determinehow well broken bones heal in the weightlessness of space.   The animals will be compared with a ground control group of fourrats. Researchers believe healing will be slower in space becauseastronauts have suffered loss of calcium during flights.   The experiment is an important step toward learning how well abroken human bone might mend during long flights aboard a spacestation or on a trip to Mars.   Also aboard is a special 70 mm IMAX camera to photographdeteriorating areas of the Earth.   ``They're trying to produce a movie that shows the Earth as avery fragile thing in the universe and that maybe everybody on Earthought to pay a little attention to not destroying it,'' Blaha saidin a recent interview.   The astronauts also will conduct experiments to determine theeffects of weightlessness on plant cell division, the growth ofprotein crystals and the development of chicken embryos.   Discovery is to remain in orbit for five days, one hour, sevenminutes, landing Saturday at Edwards Air Force Base in California.</TEXT></DOC>
