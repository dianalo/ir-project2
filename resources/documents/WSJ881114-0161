The investor, who also owns the Washington Redskins football team, New York real estate, horse farms in Kentucky and the Los Angeles Daily News, said he plans to use any proceeds from the sale of cable properties to purchase other media properties such as additional newspapers.    Mr. Cooke said two of the bids involve the purchase of the entire 700,000-subscriber Cooke Cablevision systems as a unit. He said the remainder of the bidders seek to buy certain parts of Cooke Cablevision, which includes 50 cable systems in 17 states.    Mr. Cooke declined to identify the bidders, but one is apparently a consortium of several cable operators that plans to divide the Cooke properties among themselves. John Malone, president of the nation's largest cable company, Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., said his company has been asked to participate in the consortium, &quot;and we've expressed interest at a certain price level in a portion of the deal.&quot;    Mr. Malone didn't identify other members of the cable group. But he said &quot;while they certainly are a buyer&quot; for the Cooke systems, &quot;the issue is price.&quot; He said Mr. Cooke's original asking price of about $2,800 a subscriber for the systems &quot;was very aggressive for the types of systems he has.&quot;    Mr. Cooke declined to discuss his asking price, but said price isn't an issue and he is &quot;flooded&quot; with attractive offers. Cable systems have recently been selling at more than $2,000 a subscriber, depending on their quality and location, but few have fetched as much as $2,800 a subscriber.    Some potential bidders are the various regional Bell operating companies, which have been increasingly interested in purchasing cable TV systems. But they have a number of other cable properties to choose from; for instance, the New York Times Co. recently put its systems, serving 165,000 subscribers, up for sale. And many of the potential acquirers of cable TV systems have recently completed major purchases. For example, Tele-Communications and Bala Cynwyd, Pa.-based Comcast Corp. just completed the $1.5 billion purchase of SCI Holdings Inc., parent of Storer Cable Inc. &quot;We have some digestion to do right now,&quot; Mr. Malone said.    Mr. Cooke bought into the cable business in 1987 at an average price of only $1,800 a subscriber. </TEXT></DOC>
