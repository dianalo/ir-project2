Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington, D.C.-basedFoundation on Economic Trends, said he filed the lawsuit Thursdayafter discovering that the dairy board had contracted with a publicrelations firm to promote the growth hormone.   Rifkin has used various legal maneuvers to try to block the useof bovine growth hormone on the grounds that it is unsafe forhumans.   The latest action is based on documents he obtained under theFreedom of Information Act that Rifkin says show the dairy boardwas working in collusion with the growth hormone's makers topromote it.   He also petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration onThursday to ``immediately halt any promotion of this product by FDAofficials and to immediately rescind the use of this product in themarketplace until it is approved.''   The FDA is considering whether to approve the hormone forroutine use, but it has already allowed milk from experimentallytreated cows to be released for human consumption.   Yvonne Dock, the dairy board's spokeswoman, said she had nocomment on Rifkin's action or his remarks. William Grigg, an FDAspokesman, also had no comment, saying the agency had not yet seenthe petition.   Grigg defended the decision to allow consumption of milkcontaining the hormone.   ``The safety to human beings is clear,'' Grigg said. He said thehormone has no effect in humans and occurs naturally in milk, ``sowe've always consumed it.''   Rifkin and other critics have charged that the hormone couldhave deleterious effects on human health. Questions have also beenraised about the economic consequences of boosting the milk supplyand thus presumably lowering milk prices.   Rifkin said the dairy board is prevented by law from promotingsuch substances before they are approved by the FDA.   ``The dairy board cannot put out any information regardingefficacy or safety of a product before its approval,'' Rifkin said.``It is a violation of the law. Nor can they collude and be inmeetings with private companies to be in such a campaign.''   The lawsuit seeks to block the board ``from continuing withtheir campaign to promote this product,'' Rifkin said.   The board was set up by Congress to help increase theconsumption of dairy products produced in the United States, saidMaureen Bergen, the board's director of advertising and promotionprograms.   The Department of Agriculture oversees and approves itsexpenses, she said, but the board is funded by dairy farmers, notthe government.   The documents obtained in Rifkin's Freedom of Information Actrequest include minutes of an April meeting in which the boardagreed to spend $1,085,000 on a public relations firm ``for themanagement of the BST issue.'' BST stands for bovine somatotropin,the technical term for the hormone.   In a March 12 letter obtained by Rifkin, Ernest Miller, chairmanofthe board's industry and public relations committee, said thatthe law requires that no board funds ``are to be spent to influencelegislation on regulation.''   ``If NDB (the National Dairy Board) were to become proactive onBST while it is still under government review, that action could beconstrued as lobbying on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies,''the letter continued.</TEXT></DOC>
