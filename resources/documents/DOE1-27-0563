The primary effect of supercritical extraction, SCE, on thescattering pattern was the appearance of a shoulder at the larger smallangles. This additional scattering was attributed to the formation ofan extensive new micropore structure. In the past months we have continuedour scattering experiments on Beulah lignite and begun our study of Wyodaksubbituminous coal. Work on the extract composition is progressing atthe UNDERC and a brief account of their work is included as an appendixto this report.</TEXT></DOC>
