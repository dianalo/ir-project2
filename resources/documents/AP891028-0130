Swaggart's lawyers hope to persuade the nation's highest courtTuesday to overturn rulings that forced the Louisiana-based JimmySwaggart Ministries to pay California $183,000 in back taxes andinterest for the years 1974 through 1981. They will argue that theCalifornia tax on Bibles, religious literature, recordings andother items sold by the Ministries violates religious freedom.   No other state has such a tax, Swaggart's attorneys say.   The National Council of Churches, the Evangelical Council ofFinancial Accountability, Prison Fellowship, the National TaxPayers Union, the Association for Public Justice, and other groupshave filed briefs on Swaggart's behalf, said William Treeby,Swaggart's New Orleans lawyer.   ``Churches beyond the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries realize thisissue carries broad implications that would chill, if not totallyend the dissemination of religious messages, especially acrossstate lines,'' said Treeby.   ``If the court says you can impose this tax it will have adramatic effect on all churches,'' said Charles R. Ajalat, the LosAngeles lawyer representing Swaggart. ``It's a very important FirstAmendment case. They're talking about taxing Bibles, religiousservice tapes and religious music. The sales of these items arereally people making donations to the ministry.''   California, however, claims that sales of tangible property arenot protected by the Constitution whether they are made by a shopor a church.   ``If a Bible is sold in a bookstore, it's taxed. That's the sameas if a church sells it. Donations are tax-exempt. They can makeall the donations they want, but when they start buying and sellingit's another matter,'' said Gary Jugum, assistant chief counsel tothe California Board of Equalization.   When Swaggart Ministries sells the Bible, Treeby says, it'sdifferent.   ``A book store is in the business for profit; Jimmy SwaggartMinistries is a non-profit organization,'' he said.   In earlier appeals, which were rejected by the CaliforniaSupreme Court, Swaggart admitted that some items the ministry soldwere subject to the tax, Jugum said. Those items included mugs,bowls, plates, pen and pencil sets, bud vases, Communion cups,candlesticks, replicas of Roman coins, T-shirts bearing theministry's logo and plastic replicas of the crown of thorns and Arkof the Covenant.   ``Where do you draw the line? If you put words from the Bible ona coffee mug is that taxable or is it a symbol of religiousfreedom? That's the danger here,'' said Jugum.   For the years at issue, California and Swaggart Ministriesestimate that sales from Baton Rouge, La., to California consumerstotaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandise at California crusadestotaled $240,000.   California has not taxed the ministry since 1982, pendingappeal, but if the Supreme Court rules against the ministry, itmust pay the state taxes based on its sales over the past sevenyears.   Swaggart's Baton Rouge-based ministry was once estimated bylocal officials to be a $150 million industry. That changed inFebruary 1988 when Swaggart confessed to ``moral failure.''   Although Swaggart never gave specifics, a rival minister saidthe transgression involved liaisons with a New Orleans prostitute.Swaggart was later defrocked by the Assemblies of God.   Swaggart's ministry is leaner now _ construction projects at his$10 million complex were halted after many television stationsstopped carrying his programs _ but it still remains a big industryin Baton Rouge.   Ministry officials won't discuss specifics but tourism andconvention officials said visitors are still drawn to the BatonRouge area to attend camp meetings and revivals.</TEXT></DOC>
