While the typical electric power plantreleases two-thirds of its input energy to the environment, cogenerationsystems capture and use a substantial portion of this wasted heating,cooling, or meeting industrial process needs. Cogeneration has also becomean important supplement and alternative to traditional baseload electricpower plants. These efficiency and competitive factors motivated Congressto include provisions in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of1978 (PURPA), designed to encourage the use of cogeneration in nonutilityapplications. One of the major provisions of PURPA and its subsequentfederal implementation rules requires electric utilities to purchasecogenerated electricity at a rate which can equal, but not exceed, theutility's avoided cost of generating or purchasing additional electricity.There is considerable debate today regarding the level at which thesebuyback rates have been set before state commissions. The chapter examinesthe actual cost of cogenerated electricity relative to the respectiveavoided costs as set by the state regulatory commissions, and the costof other utility purchased power. The chapter is based on 87 cogenerationfacilities which have filed for qualifying status under PURPA (QFs).These 87 facilities, located throughout the US, have a combined capacityof nearly 5700 megawatts-about one-fourth of the total filed with theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and a much higher proportionof the capacity on line today.</TEXT></DOC>
