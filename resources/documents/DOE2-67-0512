The schemeis based on the use of radiation from the 4s{sup 2}4p {sup 2}P/sup circle-open//sub3/2/ --4s{sup 2}5s {sup 2}S{sub 1}/sub //{sub 2} transition of galliumlikeMo/sup 11+/ to pump the 4s{sup 2}4p{sup 6} {sup 1}S{sub 0}--4s{sup 2}4p{sup5}6s 1/2[1/2]{sub 1} transition of kryptonlike Mo/sup 6+/. The Mo/sup6+/ ion would then lase through several possible 4s{sup 2}4p{sup 5}5p--4s{sup2}4p{sup 5}6s transitions near 60 nm.</TEXT></DOC>
