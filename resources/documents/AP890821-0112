Police detained dozens of demonstrators who marched through thecenter of old Prague calling for democratic reform and thewithdrawal of Soviet troops.   The two-hour rally started when a group of Hungarian youths tolda cheering crowd they disagreed with Hungary's participation in the1968 invasion and then unfurled a banner reading, ``The Bolshevikscame with tanks, we come with flowers.''   Many protesters were beaten by police but it was not knownwhether any were seriously injured. It could not be determined howmany demonstrators were detained.   Austrian television said police cut one of its camera cables andthen felled a crew member with what the correspondent described as a``karate stroke.''   The rally was smaller than a demonstration by 10,000 people onAug. 21 last year, but occurred despite warnings by Czechoslovakauthorities that force would be used to break up any protests.   Fearing bloodshed, activists had warned against street protests.   The official CTK news agency said 1,500 people took part in a``provocation'' organized ``by hostile centers from abroad.'' Itsaid those detained would be ``punished according to Czechoslovaklaw.''   Police sirens sounded through the area for hours after theprotest began as vanloads of helmeted riot police and regularuniformed forces moved in to downtown Prague.   The protest began at about 5 p.m. _ the hour appointed by sixdissident groups for a two-minute silent protest against theinvasion.   The crowd gathered around the Hungarian activists at the lowerend of Wenceslas Square _ a long boulevard in central Prague _ andshouted mockingly ``Gorbachev sees this!'' as riot police moved in.They referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``You must know that Hungarian youth never agreed with theinvasion!'' Hungarian activist Gyorgy Kereniy shouted to applauseand chants of ``Long live Hungary!''   Plainclothes police barged through the crowd and detained Kereniy.   As they moved from Wenceslas Square to Old Town Square and thefederal government headquarters, where they were turned back bypolice, the demonstrators chanted ``Long live Poland!'' and``Russians go home!''   They also shouted support for Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the``Prague Spring'' reforms crushed by the 1968 invasion.   Dubcek, who was ousted as party leader in April 1969 and expelledfrom communist ranks in 1970, has called for fresh reforms andrehabilitation of the half a million communists expelled after 1968.   Prague's Communist leadership has resisted mounting pressure athome and from East bloc reformers for the political changes underway in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.   Authorities had warned against demonstrations this year,harassing and detaining leading dissidents and mounting a tightsecurity operation for the past two days in Prague.   Most well-known dissidents were warned weeks in advance to stayout of Prague and other big cities for the anniversary. Two whostayed in the capital, Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova and herson, David, were placed under house arrest on Sunday.   Activists recommended Czechoslovaks sign a petition fordemocratic reforms instead of holding street protests, fearingpolice would shoot demonstrators.   On Monday, the state-run media ran no commentary of their own onthe invasion anniversary, limiting their reporting to comments fromother Warsaw Pact states that participated in the intervention.   A Polish parliamentary resolution said the invasion was aviolation of international law, and on Monday, lawmakers fromPoland's Solidarity movement led a rally in the border town ofCieszyn.   ``Never Again Brotherly Help,'' read a banner carried byprotesters, according to Poland's state PAP news agency.   Leaders of Hungary's Communist Party said last week they did notagree with the invasion. On Sunday, Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemethsaid his country has initiated steps within the Warsaw Pact to makemilitary interference impossible in the future.   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying,``It is our hope that ... Czechoslovakia will recall the events of1968 and ... will display a greater tolerance for freedom ofexpression and assembly.''</TEXT></DOC>
