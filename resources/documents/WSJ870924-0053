Sandamp;P said the move involves $4 billion of debt as well as $260 million of university general obligation debt and state contractual debt.    &quot;At issue is whether or not the state can secure a sound financial position, by addressing on a timely basis any budgetary gap that may arise as a result of any changes in its major revenue sources,&quot; Sandamp;P said.    Florida Budget Director Glenn Robertson said the state hadn't expected Sandamp;P's action. &quot;I had the impression that there was nothing imminent,&quot; he said.    Mr. Robertson said the move wouldn't have any immediate effect on the state's financial situation, since it doesn't have any plans to issue bonds. Nonetheless, the move will likely further complicate the already chaotic debate over Gov. Bob Martinez's proposal to kill the services tax.    A special legislative session called to decide the tax's fate ended Tuesday with no action. Lawmakers were divided over several options: to repeal the tax and replace it with another tax; to repeal it without replacing it; or to revise it to make it more popular.    The tax, the most sweeping levy of its kind ever implemented by a state, took effect in July. It extends the state's 5% sales tax to a variety of services, such as pest control and advertising. Gov. Martinez originally supported the tax as a way to help meet Florida's growing revenue needs. But he switched positions last week, citing the tax's unpopularity. Florida's problems with the tax have been seen as a troublesome sign for other revenue-needy states looking for ways to broaden their tax bases.    The Legislature is expected to reconvene Monday to continue to debate the tax. </TEXT></DOC>
