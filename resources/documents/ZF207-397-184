 Pilgrim almost died when he was 18.andP;  A gun accident sent abullet careening into the base of his skull, shattering vertebrae andsevering his spinal cord.andP;  As a result, he can move nothing but his eyes andhis mouth.andP;  One of his lungs has collapsed, and his diaphragm is partlyparalyzed.andP;  He's easily winded.andM;Sometimes, when he's on a hot streak, Pilgrim programs until four o'clock.andO;But by the end of the workday, he is exhausted from talking to the speechrecognition system that translates spoken words into a form the PCunderstands.andM;The PC lets all of us do things faster--sometimes a lot faster--than weotherwise could.andP;  But for Pilgrim and other disabled people, the PC has amore profound significance.andP;  For the blind person, the quadriplegic, and thevictim of cerebral palsy, the machine is a ticket to personal accomplishmentand economic independence, as well as freedom from the isolation that oftenaccompanies disability.andM;Scores of PC devices--mostly from small, entrepreneurial companies--arehelping disabled PC users overcome physical handicaps.andP;  Computers talk to theblind and listen to the commands of those who cannot move.andP;  Head-mountedswitches let the severely paralyzed use Morse code to communicate with thePC.andP;  And the PC, in turn, can introduce the disabled via electronic mail topeople, activities, and opportunities that they could not otherwise reach.andM;But while these products abound, they remain beyond the reach ofmany--largely because of a financial Catch-22.andP;  Many disabled people areunemployed, or underemployed, and can't afford the equipment that would makeit possible for them to hold jobs and move into higher-paying positions.andO;Adaptive devices for the disabled are rarely covered by Medicare and privatedisability insurers.andP;  As a result, only the most financially secure anddownright determined are using the PC to break through employment barriers.andM;Seeing-Eye MachinesandM;One who has succeeded in breaking through is Albert Gayzagian.andP;  Gayzagian,who is blind, started as a typist in the personnel department of Boston'sJohn Hancock Insurance Company in 1952, a tie when few adaptive devices toassist the blind existed.andM;Today, he is a financial officer at the company, and he uses a speciallyequipped PC-XT to perform tasks that once required the assistance of sightedcoworkers.andM;Early on, he says, &quot;I had to do things the hard way.andP;  I'd tell the staffpeople what numbers to punch into a calculator, and they'd tell me theanswer.andP;  I think sometimes about how nice it would have been if moretechnology had been available.&quot;andM;Assistive devices, when they existed at all, tended to be tactile equipmentthat just happened to be useful to the blind, not designated for them.andM;&quot;One year,&quot; says Gayzagian, &quot;I put the whole salary payroll program on anabacus--and never told anybody.&quot;andP;  The PC, he says, has &quot;totally changed theway I can work.&quot;andM;No longer does he need assistants to operate the calculator; he runs hiscomputations through Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  The salary payroll program has come offthe abacus and onto a computer.andP;  The PC announces what is on its screen usingthe Verbal Operating System (VOS) from Computer Conversations, in Alexandria,Ohio.andM;VOS and other screen-reading programs convert displayed text into speechoutput, pronounce words they recognize, and spell out words they don't.andP;  VOScan also recite punctuation, though experienced users can turn off thepunctuation feature if it isn't needed to resolve an ambiguity.andM;Tactile output devices also bring the blind into the PC community.andO;VersaBraille II Plus, from the Telesensory Corporation, in Mountain View,California, connects to a PC to convert onscreen letters into braille.andP;  Thebraille letters, 20 at a time, pop up in a small windowed surface on thedesktop VersaBraille machine as the user navigates the screen using thestandard arrow keys.andM;As useful as VersaBraille is, however, it is not a panacea for the entireblind population; only about one blind person in eight can read braille.andO;And, as with screen-reading programs, it is limited by its inability totranslate graphic images--it understands only ASCII.andP;  In fact, virtually allPC adaptive equipment for the blind operates in the character-based DOSenvironment.andM;A Graphical Catastrophe?andM;&quot;I just ignore graphics,&quot; says Christine Donchue, a blind programmer/analystat Travelers Insurance who listens to her PS/2 computer with the help ofIBM's ScreenReader program.andP;  &quot;Most of what is put in pictures can bedescribed verbally,&quot; she says.andM;The day is approaching when graphics cannot be ignored.andP;  The PC industry'smove to graphical user interfaces is arousing concern among the visuallydisabled--and with good reason.andM;The sightless person's workhorse device--the screen reader--requires thattext be stored in screen memory as ASCII characters.andP;  Today's DOS machinesfulfill that requirement, but the trend points in a disturbing direction.andP;  Asit is, the Macintosh, uses a graphical interface that is essentiallyinaccessible to the blind: the Mac's screen memory contains only rawinformation about each pixel, and screen readers can't make sense of thebit-mapped display.andM;The more graphical the interface, the less translatable it is into speech.andP;  Ascreen full of icons, pictures, and overlapping windows becomes gibberish toa screen-reading program seeking clean ASCII code.andP;  To the extent that DOSand OS/2 emulate the Mac's graphical interface, the blind will soon be lockedout of PCs as well.andM;The new graphical interfaces being touted for PCs may herald a return to thebad old days for blind users like Gayzagian.andP;  &quot;I get very concerned when Ilook at what's coming,&quot; Gayzagian admits.andP;  &quot;The newer developments may leaveblind people out.andP;  I may have to freeze with the XT I have and try to getby.&quot;andM;For people who are partially blind, however, the future does not seem sobleak.andP;  A number of adaptive devices can help people who can see the screenbut cannot make out normal-sized text.andP;  For instance, software such as LargePrint DOS from Optelec, of Harvard, Massachusetts, does for computers whatlarge-print books do for literature.andM;Other devices offered to these users allow access to graphical interfaces.andO;Magnification lenses, such as the Compu-Lenz available from AbleTechConnection, in Kettering, Ohio, simply fit over the screen and magnifywhatever is on it--graphs, windows, or icons, as well as text.andM;Reading from PaperandM;Access to the computer screen is only part of the solution.andP;  As long asinformation is distributed on paper, blind people need to be able to readprint like everyone else.andM;The Telesensory Corporation, maker of VersaBraille, also offers Optacon,which allows users to move a small scanner over a document with one handwhile the index finger of the other &quot;feels&quot; the letters as they arereproduced in a nest of closely spaced, vibrating metal pins.andM;In this way, Optacon produces a tactile &quot;picture&quot; of the document.andP;  As theuser runs the scanner across the page, the pins spell out the words,character by character.andP;  Optacon does not use braille; learning todistinguish one letter from another by feel takes practice, and evenexperienced users may find, &quot;reading&quot; in this way a slow process.andP;  Still,Optacon frees users from having to wait months while books and articles aretranslated into braille.andM;Optacon user Richard Gage, a research staff member at IBM's ScientificCenter, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says it takes him several minutes toread a single column of text.andP;  Gage, who has been blind since birth,sometimes enlists the aid of colleagues.andP;  &quot;If a memo is sent out,&quot; he says,&quot;I'll find someone who hasn't read it yet and have them read it aloud.andP;  It'snot a waste of their time because they need to read it anyway.&quot;andM;However, high-tech equipment can replace a human reader.andP;  More than ten yearsago inventor Ray Kurzweil astonished the blind community with such a machine.andO;It could read printed paper text and convert it into synthetic speech.andP;  At$50,000, however, the Kurzweil reading machine found a limited market; only750 are now in use, according to Kurzweil Computer Products, in Cambridge,Massachusetts.andP;  Almost all are installed in libraries and institutions.andM;After a decade of unfulfilled promises, Kurzweil last year introduced a muchsmaller and less expensive reading machine--the Personal Reader.andP;  A systemwith a handheld scanner sells for $7,950; with a flatbed scanner, it's$9,950.andP;  Like the earlier Kurzweil, the Personal Reader can be trained torecognize virtually any typeface.andP;  It uses one of the best speechsynthesizers available--the Digital Equipment Corporation's DECtalk unit--togive reasonably high-quality voice output.andM;The Personal Reader replicates basic human into-nation, avoiding the roboticmonotone of more primitive systems.andP;  Pitch drops when the speaker pausesafter punctuation or reaches the end of a statement; it rises slightly toindicate a question.andM;The Kurzweil Personal Reader is far from perfect.andP;  It works most reliablywith single-column, laser-printed copy in common typefaces, but may failmiserably when trying to decipher a multicolumn magazine page with graphics.andM;Long the only game in town for blind people who need to have documents readaloud, Kurzweil has new competition, Arkenstone, in Santa Clara, California,a nonprofit spin-off from optical character recognition vendor Calera, offersa system called the Arkenstone Reader, with similar capabilities, for lessthan $5,000.andP;  Unlike Kurzweil, which markets its system as a standalonepackage, Arkenstone sells its product as a PC peripheral.andM;Empowering the ImmobileandM;Four years ago, Hewlett-Packard researcher Ronald Pulleyblank felt a twitchin his left arm.andP;  He went ahead with a planned trip to the Netherlands, wherehe had been invited to serve as a visiting scientist at the Delft Universityof Technology.andM;The twitch didn't go away.andP;  During his year in Holland, Pulleyblank lostcontrol of muscle after muscle.andP;  The diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), a degenerative condition commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.andM;By the time he returned home, Pulleyblank, who has a doctorate in electricalengineering and had worked at prestigious Bell Labs, could barely walk.andM;Although today he has no motor control from the neck down, he continues towork for HP's laboratories from his home by using a head-mounted pointingsystem to operate his PC.andP;  He uses the computer to program algorithms forcomputer graphics.andP;  Pulleyblank's home computer has limited graphics ability;to view the images his programs create, he spends one day a week at the lab.andM;Pulleyblank uses the Words Plus Software Keyboard Emulator.andP;  He attaches acamera to his head and looks at the emulator screen, which displays akeyboard.andP;  The camera sends an image of the screen to the emulator, whichdisplays a dot at the spot Pulleyblank is turned to.andP;  If he holds his gazefor a second, the selected letter appears on the screen of his 286 machine.andO;(FreeWheel, from Pointer Systems, in Burlington, Vermont, is a similarproduct.andP;  Users wear a lightweight reflector on their heads or any part ofthe body to send an infrared signal indicating where the cursor should go.)andM;&quot;It's slow, but it's not frustrating,&quot; says Pulleyblank.andP;  &quot;I was never morethan a one-finger typist anyway.&quot;andM;Besides, he says, he is in on position to be choosy.andP;  &quot;Without this, I'd bedoing nothing at all, and that's infinitely worse,&quot; he says.andP;  Fasterinterfaces, such as voice recognition systems, would not work for Pulleyblankbecause his lungs failed two-and-a-half years ago, leaving him dependent on aventilator.andP;  He speaks for only a few seconds at a time, then must pause,waiting for another breath from his life-sustaining machine.andM;For those with greater muscular control, lower-tech options are available.andO;People with good control of their neck and head muscles, for example, can usea mouthstick, which is a piece of wood or plastic that users grip in theirteeth to poke at the keyboard.andP;  Mouthsticks are inexpensive; sometimes evenan ordinary pencil will suffice.andP;  A mouthstick user can become almost asproficient as a one-finger typist.andM;But many quadriplegics and cerebral palsy victims lack the neck-musclecontrol the device demands.andP;  And there are other complications; the stickmust be kept clean because it sits so long in the user's mouth, and thekeyboard must be shielded from saliva.andP;  Also, it is impossible to depresskeys simultaneously.andM;Keyboard macro programs such as ProKey and Keyworks let the user modify thekeyboard to combine common commands in a single keystroke.andP;  Such softwarealso lets them turn the Alt, Ctrl, and shift keys into toggle switches--pressonce to activate, a second time to deactivate.andP;  For an able-bodied PC user,such macros represent power tools; for the disabled, they are a necessity.andM;Other help comes in the form of simple devices such as keyguards.andP;  These letpeople with poor arm control rest their hands on the keyboard without makingaccidental keystrokes; to push a key they must poke a finger or stick througha hole in the protective shield.andM;Specialty keyboards can also compensate for specific disabilities.andP;  Thosewith cerebral palsy who can make large arm movements but lack fine fingercontrol, for example, can use an oversized device such as the King Keyboardfrom Technical Aids and Systems for the Handicapped (TASH) in Markham,Ontario.andP;  Another TASH product, the Mini Keyboard, is designed for peoplewith good dexterity but limited range of motion, such as those suffering frommuscular dystrophy.andM;Still another, called the Unicorn Expanded Keyboard, comes as a flat panelwith a membrane surface that can be configured to have 2 to 128 keys.andP;  Thebetter the user's motor control, the more closely spaced (and hence morenumerous) the keys can be.andP;  The Unicorn cannot communicate directly with thePC, however.andP;  Instead, it plugs into an interface box called the PC SerialAid, also available from TASH.andM;New GadgetsandM;New, more exotic technologies for the disabled promise even bettercapabilities.andM;PRAB Command in Kalamazoo, Michigan, has adapted one of its robot systems tofulfill the far more delicate mission of office servant.andP;  The robot is fullyvoice controlled.andP;  You can say &quot;Get Lotus,&quot; for example, and the arm fetchesthe 1-2-3 manual from a bin.andP;  Say &quot;Get drink&quot; and the mechanical servantbrings a container of water.andP;  (See the Next department in this issue for adiscussion of computerized personal robots.)andM;A brain-wave interface developed at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye ResearchInstitute, in San Francisco, can monitor electrical activity in the brain tofind out where on the screen the user is staring.andP;  The trick is to divide thedisplay into a checkerboard, with each square flashing on and off atdifferent intervals.andP;  The interface is able to determine which section of thescreen is being looked at by reading the user's brain waves, which pulsate insynchrony with the part of the screen being viewed.andM;Researchers elsewhere are taking the brain-scanning idea one step further,according to Mary Pat Radabaugh, director of the IBM National Support Centerfor Persons with Disabilities, in Atlanta.andP;  The premise is that people'sbrains respond to words and ideas in similar ways.andP;  Two different people whothink about trees, for example, might produce similar patterns of electricalactivity in their brains.andP;  The objective is to calibrate a computer input tothe pattern.andP;  Then a user could strap on some electrodes and think abouttrees, and the word trees (or a picture) would appear onscreen.andM;But Who Pays?andM;Almost 20 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 64 are disabled,according to Carl Brown, a vice president at the Electronics IndustriesAssociation, in Washington, D.C.andP;  Enlightened companies buy equipment fordisabled employees; both IBM and Apple, for example, put out thick, slickpublications chronicling the accomplishments of their disabled workers.andM;For many people, however, costs continue to be prohibitive.andP;  No singlesegment of the disabled population constitutes the kind of mass market thatpermits manufacturers to turn adaptive products into affordable commodities.andO;With few exceptions--notably voice recognition--the technologies used asspecial interfaces for the disabled hold little allure for the able-bodied PCcommunity.andM;Compounding the problem is the fact that private insurance companies,Medicare, and Medicaid do not generally pay for computer access equipment.andO;But awareness is growing that aids for the disabled are not charity; theyserve broader business and societal interests.andM;&quot;There's a whole brain trust sitting here just vegetating,&quot; fumes WayneDinger, a programmer and consultant for PRAB Command.andP;  Dinger broke his neckin diving accident when he was 18 and is paralyzed from the shoulders down.andO;When he took the job with PRAB, says Dinger, his federal Medicare paymentswere cut off.andP;  He managed to keep his state Medicaid benefit only afterkicking up a lot of publicity in the local press.andM;&quot;I'd be financially better off just doing nothing,&quot; says Dinger.andP;  &quot;Butanybody in their right mind wants to get back to work.andP;  It's reallydepressing.&quot;andM;A ray of hope emanates from Washington (see the sidebar &quot;A View from CapitolHill&quot;).andP;  In a clear symbol of consciousness raising, Congress recently passedlegislation mandating that all computer equipment purchased by the federalgovernment be adaptable for use by the disabled.andP;  Any vendor wishing to sellinto the sizable federal market will have to assure that its equipment meetsthis guideline.andP;  And last year Congress passed a bill authorizing more than$15 million to develop assistive technologies and to help the disabled obtainthese technologies.andM;PC FreedomandM;PCs give most users some sense of liberation: by automating the tediouschores of information management, the PC lets us work at a higher level.andP;  Forseverely disabled people, the computer offers a more profound emancipation.andM;In remote northwestern Minnesota, quadriplegics are doing computer-aideddesign using a head-mounted pointing device to draw lines on the screen.andO;&quot;When they sit down at the computer, they go totally crazy,&quot; says DavidColby, who initiated the program at the Thief River Falls, Minnesota,Technical Institute.andP;  &quot;Some of these people have been storing drawings intheir heads all their lives.&quot;andM;Those with multiple disabilities need computers not only to work but also tocommunicate with their families.andP;  Laura Schiller, a former schoolteacher inSanta Rosa, California, eloquently explains the role the computer has assumedin her life.andP;  Schiller, rendered unable to move or speak by ALS, communicatessolely through her PC.andP;  She has enough hand strength to activate a smallon-off switch.andP;  This switch, combined with the Words Plus keyboard emulatorprogram, enables her to enter text.andP;  The computer display sequentiallyhighlights letters of the alphabet, and she touches the switch when the wordor letter she wants is highlighted.andM;After Schiller enters the first character, the screen offers a list of commonwords that start with that letter.andP;  In one motion, she enters a word from thelist.andP;  This saves her from the laborious task of spelling out the entire wordletter by letter.andP;  The Words Plus emulator adapts its word lists to theuser's style.andP;  Words that Schiller never selects disappear from the list;words that she frequently builds from scratch are added.andM;In addition to writing poems and stories, Schiller is able to have &quot;complexconversations&quot; with her husband, John.andP;  And each weekday she writes out forher health aide a list of the jobs that have to be done.andP;  &quot;She becomes myarms and legs so that I can run my house almost the way I would if I werehealthy,&quot; Schiller says.andM;To talk to her six-year-old son, who cannot yet read, she commands hercomputer to convert her words to synthetic speech.andM;&quot;The computer is my lifeline,&quot; says Schiller.andP;  &quot;It gives me an outlet for allthe feelings that would have remained locked inside me.&quot;andP;  When the diseasewas diagnosed, Schiller was given six months to nine years to live.andP;  That wasfive years ago.andM;&quot;I think I would have died long ago if I'd never gotten the computer,&quot; shesays.andP;  &quot;Without a way to communicate with my family and friends, without away to express my trapped feelings, I would have quickly lost the will tolive.&quot;andM;She hasn't.andP;  Though her prognosis is uncertain, she continues to write.andP;  Andone of her poems, &quot;My Phonebooth,&quot; likens her life at the PC to that of aheroic figure whose powers are suddenly released: When I need to be strong orpowerful or pretty, I simply enter my phonebooth, which is in the form of aneasy chair and a computer.andP;  Someone puts a switch in my hand and in aninstant, I change from mild-mannered wimp to Superwife, Supermom, Superme!andO;There is nothing I can't do with the power of my imagination and themarvelous machine on the table in front of me.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
