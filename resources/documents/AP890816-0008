It is a living hell for those who stillhuddle in its ruins.   ``We're living like rats underground, hiding in fear in sheltersfor endless days and nights,'' lamented Salwa Ashkar, a 22-year-oldMaronite Catholic woman who runs a beauty parlor in Christian eastBeirut. ``We can't take much more.''   Across the capital's dividing Green Line, a moonscape ofdevastated apartment blocks infested by snipers, life is asdesperate for the Moslems as well as the Christians.   ``We're going down the drain,'' said Mahmoud Shami, anengineering graduate from the American University of Beirut who hasno job and no future.   ``I'm trying to get out. Anywhere. I'll go to any country thatwill give me a visa,'' said Shami, 24.   Hospitals are running out of medicine. There's no electricity orwater. The presidential palace atop a hill overlooking Beirut in theChristian suburb of Baabda, like most buildings, has been blastedinto rubble.   Packs of stray dogs, their ribs poking through their sides,scavenge through the piles of fly-infested garbage in the streets.   Rats, some as big as cats, scamper through the stinking moundsthat lie feastering in the summer heat on nearly every alley corner.   Beneath the rubble-strewn streets, where power cables cut byshrapnel dangle from splintered wooden poles, the estimated 150,000Beirutis who cling to what is left of their lives cower for days onend in underground bunkers or basement parking lots from thebombardment.   Apartment building tenants crowd ground-floor entrances to cookwhatever they have on makeshift stoves. Housewives hand out themeager fare. The men venture out when they can to forage wood oranything that will burn.   There is nothing but despair. After 14 years of civil war, anIsraeli invasion and murderous street battles between rivalmilitias, surviving one day to the next is all Beirutis can expect.   The capital's radio stations cut into programs to report whichareas are being hit _ in between commercial breaks with bouncyjingles advertising scotch or hairsprays that seem grotesquely outof place.   The police, who long ago lost all hope of maintaining law andorder in a country that seemed bent on self-destruction, chronicleLebanon's daily disasters with painstaking dedication.   They estimate that more than 1.3 million of the 1.5 millionpeople who lived in Beirut before the latest spasm of fightingbetween the Christians and the Syrians broke out March 8 have fledthe city.   Every day in Moslem west Beirut, when the shelling eases, peopleemerge from the bunkers, load up cars and pickups with whatever theycan carry, and head south.   Some find shelter with relatives. But tens of thousands have tocamp out along the coastal highway as they did when they fled theIsraeli siege of Beirut in 1982.   They sleep in their cars or under plastic sheets.   For miles along the highway, these refugees in their own landsquat beside the road, listening to the rumble of shellfire to thenorth ripping their city apart.   In east Beirut, the Christians are not so lucky. Their310-square-mile enclave, shrunken after years of defeats in thecivil war, is ringed to the north, south and east by the Syrians andtheir allies.   The only way out is by sea, past a Syrian blockade on ships boundfor Cyprus. Not everyone makes it.   A Christian couple lost their two daughters a few nights ago whenSyrian shellfire hit the speedboat ferrying them to aNorwegian-owned hydrofoil, the Santa Maria, that sneaks in at night.   The parents were separated when they were pulled from theMediterranean by the Santa Maria's crew. Both thought the other hadthe children.   It wasn't until they reached the Cypriot port of Larnaca hourslater that they bumped into each other and learned their childrenhad been killed.   Many Christians had fled to the comparative safety of ski resortsof Faraya, Harajel and Ashkout in the pine-studded centralmountains. But it it expensive: A two-room apartment rents for about$1,800 a month.   Some Beirutis have stuck it out. Some have nowhere to go. Somehave no money to get out. Some have just given up and wait for theend.   Gaby, the Armenian who has had a barber shop in the basement ofthe Commodore Hotel for 15 years, is still there. He used to havehundreds of customers a month, sipping scotch as he clipped theirhair. Now he's lucky if he gets a dozen.   His best customers in the ruined hotel, once headquarters for theforeign press, are the 30 Syrian soldiers billeted there. If he'slucky, they sometimes leave a tip.   ``Mostly they don't bother paying,'' he said. ``What can I do?There's nowhere for me to go anymore.''   The Christians, paralyzed by a fuel shortage because of theblockade, line up at gas stations. Gas canisters for cooking costabout $21. In more peaceful times they cost $1.   In the Moslem sector, fuel is more plentiful, although stillscarce. Oil and gas are brought in from Syria, but even that'sbecoming risky because the Christians are shelling the mountainroads used by Syrian convoys.   Beirut's cafes and restaurants, once the haunt of high-rollingArab sheiks and their bejeweled women, are closed: no customers, nopower, no water.   A few bistros open briefly during lulls along rubble-strewn HamraStreet, the main commercial thoroughfare that once bustled withlife. But few risk sitting down for a coffee when a shell could blowthem away at any minute.   Along west Beirut's corniche, the Syrians have set up artilleryguns that shell the Christian side across the bay. They have becomea favorite target for Christian gunners, which makes for dangerousliving in the apartment blocks lining the corniche.   Government offices, banks, businesses are closed. What was leftof the government system after years of fighting has ceased tofunction.   No one is being paid. Schools have been closed for months.Parents teach children at home, often in the shelters duringshelling.   Central Bank Governor Edmond Naim lives in the building'sunderground bunker and refuses to answer the telephone _ even whenit is functioning _ because the bank isn't operating.   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun huddles in his bunker twofloors below the presidential palace, which has been demolished bySyrian shellfire.   Simon Khoury, Aoun's spokesman, said the two-story, 35-roomcomplex has been hit by 10 240mm mortar rounds, designed to knockout army bunkers, and scores of 180mm shells.   ``They try every day to blow us away, but we're still here,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
