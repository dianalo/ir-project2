The ban, the third this year, reduced traffic on intercity roadsand highways by up to 90 percent, according to several dispatchersand broadcast reports from the provinces. City traffic appeared tobe about a third of that on a normal day.   Only two privately owned city buses were seen in a tour of thecapital and the surrounding area. Several state-owned buses withsoldiers aboard for protection were providing transport, as weresome army trucks.   But most Salvadorans either walked or boarded overcrowdedpickups and vans converted to public transport by their owners. Thedrivers charged an average of two colones (40 cents) per trip, orabout six times the average bus fare.   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, whohave waged an 8-year campaign against the U.S.-backed government,warned drivers to heed the measure. They did not say how long itwould last.   On the clandestine Radio Venceremos, the rebels said they weretaking down license plate numbers of vehicles violating the ban andwould retaliate with sabotage.   The guerrillas said the ban was a response to increasedrepression by security forces.   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for securityreasons, said a taxi was commandeered then burned Tuesday morningby urban commandos in northeastern San Salvador.   During transport bans in February and March, four people died,11 were wounded and 15 vehicles were burned or shot.   As was the case during the previous bans, the guerrillas onTuesday stepped up their sabotage against the state-owned electricutility. Bombs toppled several utility posts or transmissiontowers, cutting electricity to wide swatches of this nation of 5million.   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, saidall leaves for members of the 56,000-strong armed forces had beencanceled to provide security along the nation's thoroughfares.   Several citizens condemned the transport ban.   ``The ones most hurt are the humble people who use publictransport,'' said a middle-aged man who refused to give his namefor fear of the guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
