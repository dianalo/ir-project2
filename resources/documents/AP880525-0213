Chairman L. William Seidman toldthe Senate Banking Committee.   The performance of farm banks, the sore spot of the industryseveral years ago, is slowly improving as agriculture recovers fromits slump, he said.   The nation's largest banks, bedeviled by shaky loans to lessdeveloped countries, wrote off big losses last year and now have``adequate, if not comfortable, reserves,'' he said.   And there are signs that the economy of the Southwest, heavilydependent on the oil industry, has hit bottom and turned up.   Still, he warned, bank failures in Texas could rise from 50 lastyear to 70 this year because banks' performance generally lagseconomic changes.   ``We believe 1989 looks better (in Texas) for two reasons: Everymajor bank will have its problems resolved in one way or another..... And smaller banks are already showing some recovery in thefirst quarter'' of 1988, he said.   Last year, by almost any measure, was the worst for the nation's13,650 commercial banks since 1933. A record 184 banks failed _Seidman expects about the same number this year _ and banking as awhole posted its lowest profit level in 54 years, a 2.02 percentreturn on equity.   But, the entire drop can be attributed to the $20.6 billion inwrite-offs for overseas loans, a move the regulators said hasstrengthened banks' ability to deal with the problem.   ``There are two areas of concern,'' said the comptroller of thecurrency, Robert L. Clarke, whose office regulates nationallychartered banks. ``But they should not overshadow the fact that thenational banking system remains sound.''   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., agreed that ``the picture thisyear is by no means gloomy,'' but he raised concerns about thepossibility that developing country loans will have to be writtendown still further.   Banks have written off the loans by about 25 percent to 30percent, but they trade on the open market at only about 50 centson the dollar, he said.   Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller said``meaningful progress'' has been achieved on the Third World debtproblem. Because much of the value of the loans depends on thecountries' willingness, rather than their ability, to pay,judgments vary as to how much they should be written down.   Proxmire, the chairman of the committee, also questioned theability of banks to withstand a severe recession.   ``What haunts me is that Texas today might be the United Statestomorrow if we have a national recession,'' he said.   Seidman, whose agency insures bank deposits up to $100,000, saidmany banks are prepared to withstand a short recession with few illeffects.   He added, ``The FDIC fund is adequate to deal with any problemswe can foresee in the banking system in 1988.''   Compared with the fund that insures savings institutions, theFDIC is in good shape, ending 1987 with $18.3 billion, up slightlyfrom the end of 1986. But, the fund could record its first loss,depending on how much it costs to restore First Republicbank Corp.of Dallas to health.   At least one thrift industry trade group, the National Councilof Savings Institutions, is eyeing the FDIC as a potential sourceof money to rescue the Sandamp;L insurance fund, which most analysts saywill not have enough money to meet the $20 billion to $60 billionpricetag of cleaning up insolvent savings institutions.   Seidman vigorously opposed that idea, arguing that the moneyshould come from the thrift industry and as a last resort, thetaxpayer.</TEXT></DOC>
