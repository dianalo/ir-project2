The shorts are betting that Apache, which has already cut its distribution twice since the 1985-86 freefall in oil and gas prices, will have to take the same step again by year-end unless natural gas prices rise. But a minority of other analysts contends that the shorts are fighting last year's battle.    A current annual payout of 70 cents a share props up the partnership units, which closed yesterday at 7 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, giving them a 9.2% yield.    &quot;The distribution is very difficult to sustain at current levels unless there is a really big increase in natural gas prices,&quot; says Erica Eager, who follows oil companies for Carl H. Pforzheimer, a brokerage.    The most prominent short sellers are the Feshbach Brothers of Menlo Park, Calif. They have bet on a decline in the issue off-and-on for the past year, a period when it tumbled 50%. The units traded above 30 in 1981 and were near 20 until late 1985. Back then, the distribution was $2.10 annually.    One key to whether Apache can maintain the payout is its annual cash flow, which totaled $80 million in 1986, including $8 million in capitalized interest. That cash flow must cover Apache's distribution, debt principal repayment and exploration and development spending. Apache says first-quarter energy prices were less than last year's average, implying that without a price upturn, 1987 cash flow won't reach last year's.    Three-fourths of Apache's business is based on natural gas prices, which haven't recovered from their lows as smartly as crude oil. Another problem is long-term debt, which has nearly tripled since 1983 to $336 million, or 49% of total capital, a relatively high level for such a partnership.    At year-end Apache had reserves of 14.8 million barrels of oil in the ground and 370 billion cubic feet of natural gas. One short seller values the reserves at $7 per barrel of oil and $1 per thousand cubic feet of gas, or $104 million for the oil and $370 million for the gas.    Those values are far too low, according to Apache, which says it believes oil and gas prices will rise while some short sellers think they will stagnate.    The bear's valuation, after subtracting long-term debt, leaves a market value of only $139 million, which, added to working capital of $24 million, totals $163 million, or about $3.50 a share. Apache says the short's values don't include 450,000 undeveloped acres and the &quot;significant potential reserves&quot; in about 200 drilling locations that haven't been fully developed. But Apache has less and less extra cash for exploration and development.    The current distribution requires $33 million annually. This year Apache must also repay at least $20 million of its debt principal, a requirement scheduled to increase to $48 million next year. This year, there would be only $19 million left for exploration and development even at last year's cash flow levels. Apache had to slash such spending 38% to $51.6 million last year and the company acknowledges it must make another big cutback.    Another potential bind: Apache's $194 million bank loan from RepublicBank Dallas bars Apache from paying more than two-thirds of its cash flow in distributions.    George Baker, an oil analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, which is Apache's investment banker, says the company could buy its way out of the bind. Apache has been the most skilled of all the independents in creating vehicles for financing oil and gas acquisitions. But even Smith Barney is neutral on the stock.    In a bold but risky move to boost assets last June, Apache bought $444 million of oil and gas properties from Occidental Petroleum in a joint purchase with Denver oilman Marvin Davis. Weeks later, Mr. Davis withdrew and sold his holding to Apache, lending fuel to critics who charged Apache overpaid initially. Apache says that Mr. Davis, who in the past has bid for several entertainment companies, may have decided &quot;to keep his powder dry.&quot;    Some analysts say Apache, which has been selling properties, could always sell more to raise cash. The shorts, says one, &quot;are underestimating the options the company has to deal with its cash flow picture.&quot; But it isn't clear how many assets Apache could sell before making RepublicBank nervous about the security on its loan.    A spokesman says Apache's top priority is reducing debt, and it has repaid $13 million in the first quarter alone.    ---   Apache Petroleum   (NYSE; Symbol: APP)   Business: Oil and gas partnership    Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Revenue: $189.9 million   Loss: $182.8 million*   Fourth quarter, Dec. 31, 1986:    Loss: $168.1 million vs. $136.8 million*    Average daily trading volume:   67,868 units (March)   Partnership units outstanding: 47.6 million    *Includes charges of $153,497,000 in 1986 and $137,824,000 in 1985 from write-down of oil and gas properties. </TEXT></DOC>
