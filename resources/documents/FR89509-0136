The new amendments, passedby Congress on November 18, 1988 (as subtitle F of title VII of the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1988, Pub.

OJJDP was originally established by the JuvenileJustice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act of 1974.The 1988 amendments altered OJJDP's previous funding structure by increasingthe mandatory Part B formula grants program allocation from a minimum of61 percent of OJJDP's total budget for title II programs to 70 percent.The program's overall appropriation was not increased to support this higherlevel of formula funding, resulting in a sharply reduced discretionaryfund allocation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mandated Studies and Reports</ITAG>The amendments require OJJDP to begin, and complete within three years,three special studies concerning:andbullet; Conditions in juvenile detention and correctional facilities andthe extent to which they comply with national standards;andbullet; Obstacles to the recovery by legal custodians of children whohave been removed by a noncustodial parent; and,andbullet; Village and tribal justice systems' treatment of Indian and Alaskannative juveniles accused of committing crimes on or near reservations,and the availability of community-based alternatives to incarceration forthese youth.In addition, the amendments require that OJJDP publish several reportsannually, including a program plan. The first program plan, reflectingFY 1990 programs, is due December 31, 1989.
