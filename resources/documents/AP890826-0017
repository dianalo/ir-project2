SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The helicopters, weapons and supplies the U.S.military is providing Colombia will help that nation take itsanti-drug battle into the remote regions where drug traffickers hide.   ``Our military equipment is well-suited for that purpose. It isdurable and designed to operate in rough terrain,'' Army Maj. DavidSuper, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday.   While the exact numbers and types of equipment have not beencompletely worked out, President Bush has decided to send some $65million worth of material to help stem the flow of illegal drugs tothe United States and help Colombia battle drug dealers.   No U.S. combat personnel will be sent to Colombia, officialsstressed, but a small number of U.S. advisers will train Colombiansin the use of the equipment.   There are 112 U.S. government employees in Colombia, including 36military personnel, the Pentagon said.   The initial $20 million package Bush has designated for Colombiaincludes some of the rough-and-tumble type of equipment that U.S.forces used in the jungles of Vietnam, such as the eight UH-1``Huey'' troop transport helicopters.   The choppers, which also may be used for ground surveillance, canbe modified to carry two .50-caliber machine guns.   ``They are fast, versatile and reliable, and can be used to greateffect to speed up transportation when the roads are bad,'' Supersaid of the choppers.   Under past Foreign Military Sales agreements, the United Stateshas sold Colombia Huey choppers, as well as the updated Blackhawkversion, which must be flown by Colombian pilots.   The Colombians can put most of the transportation, communicationsand small weapons to work if they carry out raids against the ranchheadquarters and cocaine processing plants scattered about thatcountry's rough, mountainous territory.   Included in the first package destined for Colombia are machineguns, mortars, ammunition, 4-wheel drive vehicles, ambulances,communications equipment and anti-tank guns, said White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   The anti-tank weapons could be used to blow up entire buildings,if necessary.   The Colombians are also in line to get 12 more Hueys, a Blackhawkmedical evacuation helicopter, assault boats, trucks, medicalsupplies and airplanes, Fitzwater said.   Although he did not identify which type of fixed-wing aircraftmight be sent the Colombians, a good candidate would be an A-37, asmall two-person attack jet that can carry small rockets or bombs.   The Colombians already have 18 similar aircraft in their own airforce and have pilots familiar with such a craft.   The Blackhawk helicopter, which can be transformed into a medicalevacuation chopper, is the larger, modernized version of the olderHuey, and can carry twice the payload.   Super noted the type of U.S. trainers that will be sent to helpwill depend on the final type of equipment that is shipped toColombia.   ``They may need help maintaining the equipment _ with mechanics _or they may request training in tactics, map reading, or first aid _any number of things that we could provide,'' Super said.</TEXT></DOC>
