The move is unusual because it marks the first major investment in an airline by Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren E. Buffett, who has tended to shy away from investments in capital-intensive and labor-intensive industries.    However, the method of investment closely parallels Mr. Buffett's $600 million purchase last month of preferred stock that is convertible into an 11% stake in Gillette Co., which has narrowly escaped battles with hostile investors in recent years.    In Omaha, Neb., Mr. Buffett said late yesterday that his USAir Group investment is friendly to management, with which he said he is happy. The closely followed investor added that he wants to see USAir Group remain independent.    The Washington-based airline holding company said Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new issue of 9.25% Series A cumulative preferred stock that is convertible after two years into USAir Group common at a conversion price of $60 a share. USAir Group estimated that the Berkshire Hathaway stake represents about 12% of its voting shares.    Unlike the Gillette move, Mr. Buffett won't become a director of USAir Group.    USAir Group, which said it welcomed Mr. Buffett's move, has been the subject of takeover speculation since late July when an investment group that includes Steinhardt Partners Limited Partnership of New York raised its stake in USAir Group to 5.89% and indicated it may consider seeking control of the company.    Since the Steinhardt move, the price of USAir Group has risen more than $5 a share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, USAir Group common rose $1 to $53 a share, and Berkshire Hathaway fell $25 to $7,650 a share. The Berkshire Hathaway investment was disclosed by USAir Group after the close of trading.    The sale of such a large stake is the strongest statement yet by USAir Group that it doesn't want to get wrapped up in the takeover frenzy that has ensnared UAL Corp. and NWA Inc. This summer, USAir Group adopted a so-called poison pill measure and yesterday announced that it had expanded its common share buy-back program to 7.2 million shares from the five million shares it announced earlier. On June 30, USAir Group had about 43.9 million common shares outstanding.    USAir Group said it will use proceeds from the preferred stock sale to finance its common share repurchase program. The company also said it is mulling whether to adopt an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. </TEXT></DOC>
