Many U.S. foreign exchange dealers took the day off,apparently stretching Wednesday's Independence Day holidayinto a long weekend. Those who were active here and in othermarkets around the world seemed to be concentrating onestablishing positions ahead of today's June U.S. employmentreport.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A lot of traders came in looking for a lower dollar&quot;after the currency's retreat in Asian and European tradingWednesday, said Thomas Palladino, a New York assistant vicepresident for Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.   &quot;There seemed to be an incentive to push the dollarlower,&quot; Mr. Palladino said, but the move didn't get thesupport it needed. &quot;Finally people decided {to say} to heckwith it, square up and wait for employment to come out.&quot;   Michael McGuinness, a foreign currency investment officerwith Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago, attributed thelack of strong selling to a &quot;feeling that most things havebeen overdone&quot; on the dollar's downside, especially what hecalled the currency's &quot;skyrocketing decline&quot; against theBritish pound.   &quot;The market was oversold,&quot; said Manfred Totzauer, seniortrader for Citibank in Frankfurt, explaining the dollar'srise in European trading yesterday. If the U.S. report todayon non-farm payroll growth is much better than expected, hesaid, &quot;short-covering could take us two pfennigs higher&quot;against the mark.   Although the dollar stood higher in late New York tradingyesterday than it was a day earlier in London, it was onlymixed by comparison with its pre-holiday New York levels. Thedollar was quoted at 1.6517 marks, up from 1.6505 lateTuesday in New York and from 1.6467 marks late Wednesday inLondon. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 150.60yen, which was down from 150.90 in New York before theholiday but up from 149.75 in London late Wednesday.   Sterling was trading at $1.7815, up from $1.7775 in NewYork Tuesday but down from $1.7845 in London Wednesday.   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 151 yensoon after the opening, unchanged from Thursday's Tokyoclose. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6553marks, up a bit from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6551 marks.   The employment report, due for release at the start of theNew York trading day, will contain the first official U.S.economic data for June. Market anticipation of easier U.S.credit has grown in recent weeks. Currency dealers willscrutinize the data for signs of a U.S. slowdown because theyassume that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspanwill do the same.   Non-farm payrolls are believed to have grown by 83,000 inJune, or by 132,000 if layoffs of temporary census workersare excluded, according to the average of estimates of 20economists.   This would follow a gain of 164,000 in May, which includedthe hiring of about 145,000 temporary census workers.   Notwithstanding the market's recent run of thin,directionless sessions, today &quot;is going to be a wild day,&quot;said Brian Jones, an economist with Salomon Brothers in NewYork. &quot;You're going to get hit with a barrage of numbers,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Unless they're all going in one direction, you'regoing to get bounced around until people have digested theinformation.&quot;   Mr. Jones said the often-overlooked hourly wage componentof the employment data may give the Fed a signal on interestrates that contradicts the one contained in the employmentdata. Analysts look for an average gain in hourly earnings of0.3%, compared with a 0.4% gain in May.   The dollar finished higher in Tokyo trading Thursday.Japanese dealers suggested that the market had sold thedollar too short Wednesday and observed that life insurancecompanies entered the market Thursday, buying the dollararound 150 yen. Other participants followed, but the dollarsubsided after it failed to break resistance about 151 yen.   A report in the Financial Times newspaper that SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev had been warned by a group of&quot;prominent politicians, scientists and army officers&quot; of apossible military coup also helped the dollar gain againstthe mark in Tokyo, traders said.   The most active cross, or non-dollar, trading was betweenthe pound and the mark. Long, or overbought, pound positionswere unwound against the German currency after the poundreached about 2.95 marks in early European trading. Sterlingended the New York session at 2.9425 marks, compared with2.9385 marks late Wednesday in London.   London traders still expect sterling to test an areabetween 2.98 and 3.00 marks. They also see a chance for thepound to move toward $1.80 in the next few weeks onspeculation about Britain's possible full entry into theEuropean Monetary System.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $361.40 an ounce, down 70 cents.Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.   In early Hong Kong trading Friday, gold was quoted at$360.60 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
