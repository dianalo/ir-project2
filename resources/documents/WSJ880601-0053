The Fed has tightened its credit reins three times in the past 2 1/2 months, nudging short-term interest rates up almost a percentage point since March. The moves have demonstrated the Fed's determination to head off any threat of inflation, despite election-year pressures to keep rates low.    But Fed officials note that while the economy seems strong, financial markets are still shaky in the wake of last October's stock market crash. As a result, the central bank wants to avoid abrupt moves, such as a rise in the discount rate, which could be a jolt to the markets.    &quot;The financial markets are still a bit fragile and skittish,&quot; said one senior Fed official, who asked that his name not be used. &quot;If you go and hit them over the head and say, 'Hey, we are going to step on the brakes,' you could easily see things get off track.&quot;    The discount rate, which is the interest rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, is largely a symbolic tool of monetary policy. The rate has been unchanged since last September, when it was raised to 6% from 5 1/2%.    But recently the Fed has been using its so-called open market operations to boost another key interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate banks charge on loans to each other. The Fed can boost that rate by selling government securities to banks, thus reducing the cash banks have available to lend.    Interviews with various Fed officials, some of whom spoke on the condition that they not be quoted, indicate that they believe the tight policy is needed to slow business and consumer spending in the U.S. A combination of strong domestic spending and rapid export growth, they fear, could prompt an outburst of inflation later this year or next year.    &quot;The rate of growth in the economy is coming along a little stronger than I would have anticipated,&quot; says Robert Boykin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. &quot;I'm not sure it is too strong, but it has the potential of becoming that way.&quot;    &quot;We've had three quarters of rather substantial economic growth, above the trend rate of growth,&quot; says Roger Guffey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. &quot;The most recent numbers don't show any real change in that.&quot;    And in a speech in Hong Kong Monday, San Francisco Fed President Robert Parry, a member of the Fed's policy committee, said he is &quot;less concerned with a potential slowdown in U.S. business activity than I am with the possibility of overheating activity and the threat of rising inflationary pressures.&quot;    The recent actions have convinced many market analysts that the Fed is determined to prevent an acceleration of inflation, despite the election-year pressures. Until recently, many analysts thought the Fed would be reluctant to raise rates during the election year. They noted that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has had a long involvement in Republican politics, and that his fellow board members were all appointed by President Reagan.    &quot;I think Greenspan is earning his spurs,&quot; says Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;And I think the Fed's message is clear. Inflation will be restrained, election year or not.&quot;    Lyle Gramley, a former Reserve Board member who now is chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, agrees. &quot;This is a very determined Federal Reserve, and it's not letting election year concerns get in the way.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
