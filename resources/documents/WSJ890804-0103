The further collapse of any order there will make it even harder for Bush to counter hostage-takers, regardless of how the current crisis plays out. The chaos in Lebanon is a perfect atmosphere for terrorists, State Department experts say. &quot;Until the Lebanese can get on the road to recovery,&quot; one official says, &quot;this anarchy and madness will continue to go on.&quot;    The Arab League gives up a push to end the fighting between Christians and Moslems in Lebanon. Iraq sends arms to Christian troops, who then battle Syrian forces and their Lebanese allies. Khomeini's death may mean Iran has even less control over Shiite terrorists in Lebanon. This internal jockeying could give captors more reason to keep or harm their hostages.    Some Mideast analysts even suspect pro-Syrian terrorists announced the killing of Higgins to signal that Syria won't be boxed out of the Lebanon picture.    INTELLIGENCE FAILURES in the Middle East produce political finger pointing.    Conservatives argue that the post-Vietnam cutbacks at the CIA, especially manpower reductions in the Carter years, are the root cause of today's problems. More reliance was placed on electronic surveillance, which is largely useless in Lebanon. Also, anti-terrorist activities, including assassinations, were restricted. But some Democrats pin much of the blame on the Reagan administration. Despite adding almost 2,000 people to spy programs, director Casey never built back Mideast operations after the 1983 devastation of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. Critics say he became too enamored with Ollie North-type escapades and relied too much for intelligence help on the Israelis, who had their own agenda.    FED CAUTION on the economy generates nagging recession worries.    Bent on reducing inflation, the Fed wants 18 more months of slow economic growth. Short-term interest rates, though declining, remain above year-ago levels. Fed watcher Eric Heinemann says the dip reflects weaker credit demand rather than any Fed moves. Prudential Insurance economist Michael Keran, mentioned for a Fed seat, puts recession odds this year at 50-50.    Maryland Sen. Sarbanes warns Greenspan that the economy is entering &quot;a rather precarious period.&quot; Tennessee Sen. Sasser lectures the Fed chief that &quot;the economic indicators are not good.&quot; Bush-administration officials are silent in public, but they privately fret about the Fed's tight-fistedness.    Pittsburgh economist Stuart Hoffman derides the &quot;Goldilocks scenario&quot; -- an economy that is not too hot, not too cold, but just right.    TERRORIST THREATS are emphasized by top White House and Pentagon officials to push for congressional support for costly weapons. Even before the hostage crisis, Quayle and Cheney argued that the B-2 bomber, SDI and other multibillion-dollar weapons are needed to combat threats from Libya, North Korea and the Middle East.    NO-WIN SUMMIT? This weekend's meeting of Central American presidents could put U.S. officials in an awkward position. If a plan is devised to dismantle the Contras before Nicaragua's promised 1990 election, the administration must either side with the Contras and alienate congressional Democrats or support the plan and anger conservatives.    WRIGHT RETURNS to Congress often enough that the former House speaker is dubbed &quot;the Phantom of the Capitol.&quot; He still uses his former congressional office, which soon will be occupied by a Texas Republican. Wright, who resigned under ethics charges in June, already has a half-dozen speaking engagements at $10,000 each.    TRIVIA QUIZ: Which state hasn't elected a Democratic senator since 1932, the longest such interval in history? Kansas, according to trivia questions in the soon-to-be-released Almanac of American Politics 1990. And the city with the largest percentage of VCRs -- 74% -- isn't Washington, but Bend, Ore.    FOLEY FACES a turning point as tough issues loom for the House speaker.    His low-key style heals wounds left after Wright's departure under an ethics cloud. &quot;It's the soft sell with logic,&quot; Illinois Rep. Rostenkowski says. But Foley's leadership will be tested in fighting for clean-air legislation and against Bush's push for a capital-gains tax cut as well as a move to repeal the catastrophic-illness insurance law.    Members of both parties praise Foley, but some fellow Democrats worry that his consensus style may not be tough enough. They wonder how well he would rebound from a defeat. Concern about Foley's style may reflect the increased decision-making it requires of colleagues. &quot;He's forcing the members to have a little spine,&quot; California Rep. Miller says.    Foley also must fulfill his own promised agenda, which includes ethics reform and campaign-finance revision.    MINOR MEMOS: Commerce chief Mosbacher, who often meets with foreign delegations, diplomatically replaces a cushion on his office couch that has the message, &quot;Happiness is being an American,&quot; with one that reads, &quot;Free Trade Avenue is a two-way street.&quot;. . . Sen. Dole quips that &quot;there are more presidential nominees lined up for congressional approvals than there are people waiting for hamburgers in Moscow.&quot; . . . Georgia Rep. Ray protests proposed House spending of $700,000 to buy one million calendars for members to give away. </TEXT></DOC>
