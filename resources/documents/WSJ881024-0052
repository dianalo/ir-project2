Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MKT </IN><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate gave final congressional approval to compromise legislation that would apply federal lobbying restrictions for the first time to former lawmakers and their top aides and stiffen the rules for former administration officials.    The measure responds to the growing sensitivity to influence-peddling by former administration officials and increasing criticism of lawmakers for not applying ethics laws to themselves. Both were heightened by the February conviction of former Reagan adviser Lyn Nofziger for violating ethics laws.    The legislation represents one of the few times lawmakers have voted to include themselves in governmentwide restrictions of any sort. It wasn't popular among congressional aides or lawmakers, who nonetheless felt they couldn't vote against it so close to the November elections. Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), the bill's sponsor in the House, said the legislation &quot;had a lot of votes, but not much support.&quot;    The measure, which reconciles differing House and Senate versions, was cleared by voice vote in the Senate after the House voted 347-7 to pass it. President Reagan hasn't indicated whether he'll sign the measure into law.    The legislation would bar former lawmakers from lobbying current members of Congress for one year after leaving office. Former top personal aides would be prohibited for one year from lobbying the lawmaker for whom they worked or that member's staff.    In addition, former committee aides would be barred for one year after leaving their job from lobbying the committee's members or staff, and former House or Senate leadership aides wouldn't be permitted for the same period to lobby any member of the leadership in the chamber in which the aides worked.    Current law doesn't place any restrictions on activities of former lawmakers or their aides.    Under the legislation, former U.S. trade officials would be barred for one year after leaving their jobs from representing any foreign-owned company in matters before the U.S. government. In addition, former top administration officials wouldn't be allowed for one year to lobby the U.S. government on behalf of a foreign government or an entity of a foreign government.    Current law bans former executive branch employees from lobbying their former agencies for one year after leaving their jobs, and from lobbying on matters in which they were personally involved for life.    The bill would impose a maximum criminal penalty of two years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. Currently, the maximum sanction is two years in prison, a $10,000 fine, or both. </TEXT></DOC>
