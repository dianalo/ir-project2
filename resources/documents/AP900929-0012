And some lawmakers, while fearful of the impact on timber jobs,say they are optimistic that adoption of a credible protection planwill help avert environmental lawsuits that threaten to bring theregion's logging to a standstill.   Concerned that its current protection plan may violate theEndangered Species Act, the Forest Service announced Friday it willfollow instead the recommendations offered in April by one of itsbiologists, Jack Ward Thomas, and a panel of government scientists.   Congressmen said the move will mean greater cuts in logging thanthe White House predicted last week.   The Forest Service estimated last spring that the Thomas planwould cause federal timber harvests in the Northwest to fall bynearly 50 percent and result in the loss of more than 20,000logging jobs.   However, President Bush last week endorsed a finding by a WhiteHouse task force that the owl could be saved from extinction byreducing next year's harvests by only about 20 percent - from thisyear's 3.85 billion board feet to about 3 billion board feet.   Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., said Friday's announcement by theForest Service means that harvests will tumble to about 2.6 billionboard feet. ``This is just a further cave-in to the folks that aretrying to put us out of business,'' said Smith, a strong supporterof the timber industry.   The action came as environmentalists were preparing to return tofederal court in Seattle to try to force the Forest Service toaccept a scientifically sound plan to protect the spotted owl'shabitat in the Northwest's old-growth forests.   The Fish and Wildlife Service on June 22 declared the rare owl athreatened species under the Endangered Species Act. An estimated3,000 pair live in the Pacific Northwest, their only habitat.   Lawmakers said the Thomas proposal would be the most sweepingprotection of wildlife in the history of the act, banning loggingon 3 million acres of national forests currently open to harvests -an area larger than the state of Maryland.   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said implementation of the Thomas planshould help prevent an onslaught of environmental lawsuits thatcould block the sale of much greater amounts of timber.   Todd True, an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,said the action was overdue. ``Certainly it is appropriate that theold (plan) has been thrown out and recognized as the poor job ithas always been,'' the environmental lawyer said.   But Evelyn Badger of the pro-industry Oregon Lands Coalitionsaid the announcement means that Forest Service Chief DaleRobertson ``has just signed eviction notices for tens of thousandsof families in the Northwest.''   The Thomas plan will remain in force until Congress adoptsanother plan or the Fish and Wildlife Service adopts a permanentrecovery plan for the owl.</TEXT></DOC>
