(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Optical DelusionsandM;Bill Gates knows technology.andP;  With Microsoft's operating margins around 30%recently, he clearly also knows the value of a dollar.andP;  So we paid attentionwhen Microsoft signed off early last year on an extensive project to convertthe central conduits of its data communications pipeline to the new andexpensive fiber optic network technology known as FDDI.andP;  But hardly anybodyfollowed Microsoft's lead.andP;  Only a couple of thousand FDDI &quot;nodes&quot; weredelivered to customers in 1989.andM;The question a lot of FDDI backers are asking now is, how many folks outthere will do as Bill Gates did?andP;  Nobody doubts that Fiber Distributed DataInterface (try saying that ten times) is going to be an important networkingstandard.andP;  People will get rich selling FDDI products.andP;  But how soon?andP;  Arethousands of companies, universities, and government labs really ready toinstall networks that are 10 times faster than Ethernet -- but also 10 timesmore expensive?andP;  Will anyone buy equipment based on standards that are notquite complete?andP;  Will they trust vendors who claim that their products willwork with others that are still in the lab?andM;Probably not.andP;  Recent hype notwithstanding, we think it will be late in theyear before enough FDDI equipment from different suppliers is available toallow conclusive tests of interoperability (another torpoid slug of a word.)andO;If it turns out that computers and other devices in large FDDI networks dowork together as smoothly as advertised, we'll be off to the races.andP;  If, asseems more likely, further fine tuning is required, it will be 1991 before wecan start talking in earnest about the Year of the Optical LAN.andM;That will be none too soon for buyers of the super-workstations that IBM andothers will start shipping later this year.andP;  With performance measured intens of MIPS, these machines will overload many an Ethernet artery.andP;  As callsfor FDDI equipment go out, prices will start falling, and good olddemand-elasticity should take hold.andP;  If all goes as well as the Dataquestforecast illustrated on the next page suggests, the world market for FDDIequipment could very well hit almost $700 million by 1993.andM;Standard behaviorandM;The rewards have been a long time coming for such FDDI boosters and pioneersas Proteon, Advanced Micro Devices, and Ungermann-Bass.andP;  FDDI was firstproposed as an advanced local area networking standard back in 1981, and fouryears later Proteon started installing its optical networks, the ProNET 80family, using many of the concepts later adopted as FDDI standards.andP;  By 1988,the hardware standards were firm enough to allow AMD to offer the firstoff-the-shelf FDDI chip set, which Ungermann-Bass used in custom equipmentfor the Microsoft installation.andM;That pace was considerably faster than the fits and starts that characterizedthe evolution of Ethernet from a gleam in Bob Metcalfe's eye (when he arrivedat Xerox in 1972) to the widely accepted networking standard in themid-1980s.andP;  And no wonder.andP;  Where Xerox, Digital Equipment, and such thenstartups as Mr. Metcalfe's 3Com had to promote Ethernet against dozens ofproprietary network schemes, the backers of FDDI include virtually everycompany in the industry.andP;  Nobody opposes FDDI.andP;  Still, after almost a decade,the standard is incomplete and installations sparse.andM;Let's do it my wayandM;The very fact that FDDI is accepted as a universal standard has made itdifficult -- and painfully time consuming -- to get agreement on those issuesthat hit closest to home.andP;  In particular, the quest for a specificationcalled Station Management Task, or SMT, has been grinding on for some fouryears.andP;  SMT is important because it says how FDDI networks will performmanagement and control functions such as fault detection and a self-healingprocess that keeps the network running in spite of a breakdown.andM;Because network management was not part of the Ethernet technicalspecification, every righteous computer and network company developed aproprietary approach to the problem.andP;  That has made it hard for the FDDIcommittee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to winagreement for an SMT spec.andP;  &quot;It's been a constant struggle,&quot; says BruceMcClure, who got involved in the ANSI process in 1984 and founded a company,Synernetics, to help commercialize SMT.andM;Let the tests beginandM;Recent progress toward a final version of SMT has quickened the pulse of FDDIboosters and prompted a flurry of product announcements ranging frominterface boards to bridges and routers.andP;  Enough of these products areavailable now to allow the all-important tests of interoperability to begin,and the initial results are encouraging.andP;  Most recently, AMD hooked upequipment from five chip-set customers, including Proteon, Sun Microsystems,and Fibronics International, and got them to exchange messages using SMTprotocols.andM;That was but a precursor.andP;  Proteon president Patrick Courtin doubts thatcustomers will materialize in large numbers until tests of far largernetworks, incorporating chips from multiple sources, have been conducted.andO;That may take a while, since only one other FDDI chip set -- from SumitomoElectric Industries -- is available and that only as part of an interfaceboard.andP;  Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, the likeliest next entry,won't even disclose architectural details of its chip set until mid-year.andO;National Semiconductor and Japan's Toshiba are also expected to join the fraythis year.andM;Looking for jitterbugsandM;Once products based on those chips are completed, the acid test will be toget dozens or hundreds of them to work together flawlessly, as they must inthe real world.andP;  Based on Proteon's experience with large high-speed network,Mr. Courtin half-expects to encounter such problems as the &quot;jitter&quot; timindisorder that occurs in some networks when stations get out of sync.andP;  Thatkind of trouble wouldn't be fatal to the cause of FDDI, but it could delayacceptance for several more months until software fixes are made.andM;No job too smallandM;The uncertainties that lie ahead haven't deterred Mr. McClure, whose businessplan is to spare FDDI vendors such onerous tasks as writing their ownsoftware to implement the SMT standard.andP;  Synernetics is taking on at leasttwo big selling jobs: one to prove that its approach won't be obsolete whenthe SMT standard is finally approved, and the other to convince equipmentmakers to give up their own SMT development efforts.andM;We think the ANSI committee is far enough along that Mr. McClure's offer toprovide the upgrades when the final standard is approved, probably later thisyear, ought to allay fears.andP;  We're less certain bout his ability to surmountthe no-invented-here barrier.andP;  Several companies that figure to be majorfavtors in FDDI, including Proteon, Hewlett-Packard, and Ungermann-Bass, tellus they will more than likely want to write their own SMT software.andP;  But thatdoesn't mean Synernetics won't find a lot of prospects among smaller playerseager to find a fast way into a new market.andM;Fast, fast, fast reliefandM;Actually, we suspect that FDDI is more a technology than a market; that is,unlike Ethernet, it is an extension of a well-penetrated market segmentrather than something entirely new and different.andP;  Admittedly, the technologyis impressive.andP;  The bandwidth of 100 megabits per second (versus Ethernet's10 megabits), the 60-mile allowable length (versus the 2-mile limit ofEthernet), and the fault-tolerant layout of two counter-rotating rings willaid network administrators.andM;But fiber optic technology is not so arcane that mainstream networkingcompanies can't master it.andP;  Some of them are hanging back,  waiting for amarket need to develop.andP;  As Dana Hendrickson, Vitalink's director ofmarketing tells us, &quot;A lot of customers haven't come close to using thebandwidth they have installed in Token Ring or Ethernet.&quot;andP;  So far, Mr.andO;Hendrickson says, FDDI is not a &quot;checkoff item&quot; for network suppliers.andP;  SoVitalink, the leader in remote bridges, doesn't feel compelled to offer itright now.andP;  Sun is shipping an FDDI controller for its workstations, and DEC,Prime, and HP's Apollo division have all announced at least the intent to doso; IBM has yet to be heard from, but is active in the standard-settingprocess.andM;Is it too soon?andM;Sooner or later, we expect, FDDI will be dominated by the same folks who nowdominate Token Ring and Ethernet, which will be supplemented rather thandisplaced by the new technology.andP;  But there ought to be room forentrepreneurs like Mr. McClure, who can supply the mainstream companies orcarve out well-defined niches.andP;  Paul Ely, the former HP and Convergentexecutive who now doles out venture capital for Alpha Partners, believes thetime is ripe for getting involved with FDDI -- &quot;although we could be threeyears early.&quot;andP;  Alpha is backing a startup called Network Peripherals, whichis exploring FDDI applications.andM;Them bones, them bonesandM;Initially, at least, most FDDI networks will be sold as &quot;backbones,&quot; like theone Ungermann-Bass installed for Microsoft.andP;  The issue here is notperformance so much as the management and control problems that multiply asnetworks grow.andP;  In Microsoft's case, FDDI provided a way to smooth thecomplexities of trying to organize more than 6,000 desktop machines andhundreds of servers into 20 or more Ethernets.andP;  Not only is the network nowfar easier to manage, Microsoft tells us, but response times have improvedeven though the number of workstations continues to multiply at a 40% annualrate.andM;FDDI backbones will be an interesting opportunity for such internetworkingcompanies as Ungermann, Proteon, Wellfleet, and cisco Systems, whose bridgeand router products will connect country-road subnetworks of computers intothe fiber superhighway.andP;  But the market won't really take off until theperformance of workstations and servers accelerates beyond the capacity ofEthernet and Token Ring to handle the flood of data they generate.andP;  Thosemachines would then have to be plugged directly into an FDDI network.andP;  Thatwon't happen on any scale until interoperability of machines from manysuppliers is proven and until prices for FDDI equipment fall substantially.andM;Standing on protocolandM;There are other ways to break through the bandwidth limits of today'snetworks.andP;  One is to improve the network protocols and spell out how packetsof data are to be created and processed.andP;  Although the bandwidth available onan Ethernet network is 10 megabits per second, individual users typicallyachieve no more than a 2-megabit rate with the usual TCP/IP protocol.andO;Hewlett-Packard and others are working on improvements to TCP/IP, hoping toget as much as a 6-megbit transfer rate out of Ethernet.andM;A more ambitious project, initially funded by Silicon Graphics and now beingnurtured in the spinoff company Protocol Engines, seeks to replace TCP/IPwith the new XTP protocol, which would be much more efficient in handlingdata.andP;  Ultimately, Protocol Engines hopes to reduce XTP to silicon, boostingthe protocol processing task in the same way that specialized processors havesouped up graphics performance.andP;  But the path to adoption of XTP as anindustry standard is likely to be a long one.andM;Ultra modernandM;For those performance buffs who can't wait for new or improved industrystandards, Ultra Network Technologies offers a proprietary alternative thatpushes fiber optic network bandwidth to the gigabit-per-second level and --just as important -- achieves a far higher effective throughput than eitherEthernet or FDDI.andP;  Workstations equipped with UltraNet send data at ratesranging from 25 to 50 megabits per second, minisupercomputers at about twicethat speed.andP;  (See the chart on Page Four).andM;Ultra has competition, including Proteon's ProNET 80 and HyperChannel fromNetwork Systems, but Ultra seems unique in providing a range of price andperformance options that tailors bandwidth to a wide range of needs.andP;  And itshigh profile, thanks to the visibility of Chairman Ken Oshman, has helpedline up marketing and technical partnerships with leading vendors ofhigh-performance systems.andP;  Ultra has picked up 45 installations sinceannouncing its technology 18 months ago; sales were $8 million last year.andM;To each his ownandM;We don't see Ultra as a direct competitor for FDDI networks.andP;  Ultra'sapproach, which involves high-speed network hubs connected to protocolprocessors on each host machine, is more appropriate for specializedapplications such as medical image processing and engineering simulation thanfor general purpose networking.andP;  Still, Ultra will benefit from the costreductions for fiber optic components that FDDI will usher in.andP;  And when XTPbecomes a standard, promises Ultra's president Stan Tenold, &quot;I'll be thefirst to use it.&quot;andM;Desktop moviesandM;What really fires the imagination about high-speed networks is not theopportunity they offer to sell esoteric technology but the impact they willhave on applications.andP;  It takes only a brief stroll through the back rooms ofsuch companies as Silicon Graphics or Stardent to appreciate the power ofthree-dimensional graphic displays to present information.andP;  For that power todistributed as widely as office automation and CAD applications are todaywill require vast increases in network bandwidth.andP;  Still more bandwidth willbe needed if we ever get serious about sharing multimedia applications thatincorporate video and audio resources.andM;So let's hear it for the lightwave links that might enable the computerrenaissance we've all been looking for.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
