Shining Path guerrillas trying to thwart Sunday's ballotingkilled a candidate and blew up a church, a school and power lines.Six other people were killed in attacks blamed on the rebels.   No overall figures were available, but turnout was high in Limaand other major cities. In the capital, authorities extended votingfor two hours to accommodate lines.   Early results from a few mountainous rebel strongholds didsuggest some voters were frightened by rumored rebel threats to cutoff the index fingers, marked with indelible ink at pollingstations, of people who voted.   In Ayacucho, 240 miles southeast of Lima, 68 percent of thevotes cast were blank, according to unofficial returns.   Soldiers armed with assault rifles patrolled the streets. Armedpolice and soldiers also provided heavy security at voting places.   Political independent Ricardo Belmont won the mayoral race inLima with nearly 49 percent of the votes, according to the returns,defeating the Democratic Front's Juan Inchaustegui, runner-up with21.5 percent.   The Democratic Front is the center-right coalition backingnovelist Mario Vargas Llosa in April's presidential elections andit was challenged in most of the municipal races by the UnitedLeft, a Marxist-led alliance.   Sunday's voting was seen, first as a trial of whether thegovernment could put on an election amid a rising tide of rebelviolence.   It was also considered a bellwether of the appeal of VargasLlosa, the presidential front-runner, as well as a gauge of justhow unpopular Garcia's center-left Aprista party has become.   Vargas Llosa called the vote ``very important to the future ofour country ... to demonstrate that Peruvians do not fear theextremist minorities that want to destroy our democracy.''   More than 130 mayors, local judges, clerks, council members andmunicipal candidates have been slain by the rebels so far thisyear, and hundreds more have resigned out of fear.   Vargas Llosa sought to play down Inchaustegui's defeat in thecapital, saying Belmont's victory signaled ``a desire for changethat is being profoundly felt from one end of the country to theother.''   With Peru suffering from 3,000 percent annual inflation andeconomic chaos, Aprista candidates had been given little chance ofwinning many mayoral races.   Vargas Llosa entered the political fray after Garcia tried in1987 to nationalize all the country's financial institutions, amove that seriously cost the once popular president.   A television exit poll Sunday showed Vargas Llosa would capture55 percent of the vote if presidential elections were heldimmediately. No other candidate got more than 14 percent support inthe poll.   The novelist applauded the victories of Democratic Frontcandidates in towns and provinces torn by guerrilla violence.   Unofficial returns from outside the capital, where nearly athird of the impoverished nation's 21 million people live, showed aclear repudiation of Aprista. Candidates of the Democratic Frontappeared to take most of the seats.   About 10 million Peruvians were registered to vote. Peru has1,947 municipalities, but election authorities said there were nocandidates in at least 86 towns due to rebel death threats.   Election officials in Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima, countedballots by candlelight Sunday night after guerrillas blew up powerpylons, causing a blackout. Police reports from the city saidrebels set off a series of dynamite charges in the city shortlyafter the blackout began.   Reporters said gunfire could be heard throughout the city, whichhas been under a nighttime curfew since Friday.   Early Sunday, the rebels dynamited a church and a school in thecity.   The attacks followed more than 20 explosions around the citySaturday night intended to disrupt the voting as the first stage intheir campaign to block the presidential election.   Police said a young man and young woman were electrocuted byfalling power lines Sunday when a power pylon was blown up 12 milesnorth of Huancayo.   They also said four people were killed and three wounded whenone of the victims stepped on a mine a few miles north of Huancayoas they were returning home from voting. The mine was presumablyset by the rebels.   Authorities said Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed theAprista mayoral candidate early Sunday in Azangaro, near theBolivian border 470 miles southeast of Lima.</TEXT></DOC>
