The maker of coatings for high-technology applications didn't say how big a loss it expects to report, or what revenue would be. But it said results will be &quot;lower than anticipated&quot; despite what it called &quot;continuing strong demand&quot; for its products. A year earlier, Southwall had net income of $261,000, or four cents a share, on revenue of $3.8 million. </TEXT></DOC>
