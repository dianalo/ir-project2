In 15 of 29cases, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) was performedto observe the lymphatics of the cardia. The rate of detection of paraaorticlymph nodes by SPECT was 66.6 %, and in particular the paraaortic lymphnodes in the upper portion of the left renal vein were detected at arate of 58.3 %. The ascending lymph flow from the cardia to the mediastinumcould be depicted by SPECT. The SPECT images and the distribution ofaccumulation of Tc-99m Rhenium colloid into the regional lymph nodesindicated a similar tendency to the actual metastatic rate of carcinomaof the cardia. Endoscopic lymphoscintigraphy with SPECT is consideredto be useful for imaging the lymph flow from the cardia to the regionallymph nodes. On the other hand, the conventional planar image was poorin depicting lymph nodes, and was impossible in dynamic analysis. Inthe early stage of carcinoma of the cardia, if the area limited, proximalgastrectomy seems reasonable, but in progressive and deepseated cancer,it is suggested that it is necessary to remove the lymph nodes in a widearea, including the paraaortic lymph nodes, in addition to performingtotal gastrectomy.</TEXT></DOC>
