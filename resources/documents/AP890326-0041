The weeklong trip to Morocco, Zimbabwe and Malawi, with astopover in Nigeria, underlines Mrs. Thatcher's transformation frombeing in the mid-1980s the focus of African resentment over whatblack states see as Western foot-dragging over South Africanapartheid.   ``This is the beginning of an initiative,'' said a seniorBritish government source, speaking on condition on anonymity.``But how far it will go is anybody's guess at the moment.''   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, once an outspoken critic ofMrs. Thatcher for her refusal to impose tough sanctions againstSouth Africa, is planning a warm welcome for the BritishConservative Party leader.   It is her first visit to the former white-ruled Rhodesia, whichBritain steered to independence in 1980, and to Malawi, anotherex-colony.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who held a surprisemeeting with Mrs. Thatcher at her invitation in London on March 15,indicated before the trip that she could play a pivotal role insouthern Africa.   Con Botha, a spokesman for South Africa's governing NationalParty, said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview thatSouth Africans have ``the highest regard'' for Mrs. Thatcher'santi-sanctions stance.   ``We also think she is in a particularly good position toinfluence African states she is going to visit now to adopt a morepragmatic attitude toward developments in southern Africa,'' hesaid.   Mrs. Thatcher may try to build on recent agreements under whichSoviet-supported Cuban troops will withdraw from Angola andU.N.-supervised elections will bring independence to Namibia.   In Zimbabwe, Mugabe will likely reiterate demands for Britain toimpose tough embargoes against South Africa, a major tradingpartner.   Talks in Zimbabwe and Malawi are expected to focus on new movesto end the civil war waged in neighboring Mozambique by Renamorebels and on the implementation of the Namibian peace settlement.   Mrs. Thatcher denied published reports she plans to organize asouthern African regional peace conference, but said Britain willhelp if asked.</TEXT></DOC>
