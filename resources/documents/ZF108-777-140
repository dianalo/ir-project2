 Several of these products as well asMacintosh networking issues are discussed.andP;  Pharos Technologies(Cincinnati, OH), for example, introduces StatusMac, acontroversial software package that enables a Macintosh networkadministrator to collect detailed information about any networkedMacintosh and its applications.andP;  Asante Technologies (Sunnyvale,CA) introduced a variety of Ethernet modules, adapters and networkinterface cards.andP;  Three vendors announced products for connectingMicrsoft Corp's Excel spreadsheet software to relational databases.andP;  Novell Inc's development activities for Macintoshnetworking are also described.andP;  The emphasis of the show was onmultimedia.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (equipment and supplies).andO;Topic:     Trade ShowsLocal Area NetworksProduct IntroductionCompatible SoftwareCompatible HardwareSoftware PackagesNetwork Management SoftwareMacWorld Exposition.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MacWorldandM;MacWorld Expo/San Francisco was everything you could want in a trade show andmore.andP;  As in more people on the show floors than you would ever want to plowyour way through.andP;  As in more lost children than you'd ever want to hearscreaming for mommy again.andM;And--to the dismay of those who bemoan the lack of press coverage aboutMacintosh networking products and issues--it was also more of the typicalMacintosh trade show atmosphere that we've all come to expect.andP;  In otherwords, it was row after seemingly endless row of booths displaying graphicsand desktop publishing applications, monitors, color printers, fax servers,cute mouse and Mac covers, educational software, and the occassional modem.andM;Mitch Hall Assoc., the Dedham, Mass.-based convention firm handling MacWorldExpo, crammed this year's Mac Expo into the Moscone Convention Center andBrooks Hall/Civic Center, two facilities about a mile and a half apart incab-and-parking-space sparse San Francisco.andP;  We mention this because SanFrancisco isn't well prepared to handle 60,000-plus convention goersdescending en masse on its earthquake-crippled freeway and street system.andM;Fortunately for the LAN Magazine staff, the Moscone Center is just threeblocks down Howard Street from our San Francisco office and thus withinwalking distance.andP;  This was not to be taken for granted, as outsidersunaccustomed to driving and parking in the city most assuredly found out ontheir way to Moscone or Brooks Hall.andM;No Roads or ParkingandM;Getting to the show in the morning was a two-pronged nightmare.andP;  First, ifattendees drove in from the outlying areas--say, Silicon Valley in thesouth--then they had to deal with heavily congested traffic.andP;  The worstexample is Highway 101 (the Bayshore), the only freeway in/out of town leftundamaged by the October 17 earthquake.andP;  Then, after a 30-minutebumper-to-bumper crawl from Candlestick Park to downtown (it's only aboutthree miles, but it seems like three times that) came the real fun--finding aparking place, hopefully near Moscone.andP;  Unless you know where to look--and,to give next year's visitors a hint, they're not around Fourth and Fifthstreets, close to Moscone--any kind of parking is scarce in the area whereMacWorld is held.andM;And those lucky enough to find the rare on-street parking often found itwasn't such a bargain, after all: Parking meters that give only five minutesof parking per dime aren't particularly user friendly, especially whenthey're in 30-minute-limit zones that are more heavily patrolled than theBerlin Wall used to be.andM;(Those once-a-year visitors to San Francisco whose visits coincide withMacWorld must have been particularly amazed at this situation.andP;  At MacWorld1989, there was plenty of parking right across the street from Moscone; thatlot, however, has since become part of the Yerba Buena Center, a multimilliondollar Moscone-expansion project that was a deep hole in the ground untilshortly before MacWorld.)andM;From the frowns on the faces of people standing in line waiting to retrievetheir cars at the City Tow parking garage, a mile or so away from Moscone, alot of convention-goers only thought they had found legal parking spots oroverstayed their welcome in timed parking spots.andM;Congested Inside, TooandM;MacWorld visitors found just as much congestion once they got inside Moscone(Brooks Hall, while crowded, didn't appear to draw the same volume of trafficas Moscone).andP;  We're talking shopping-mall-at-Christmas kind of crowded, notjust trade show crowded.andM;In that same vein, attendees were saying the kinds of things you'd hearduring your holiday shopping: &quot;Yeah, it's crowded,&quot; one harried-looking mancommented to a friend as they rode an &quot;up&quot; escalator in Moscone, &quot;but you cansure get some great deals, especially on printers.&quot;andM;And t-shirts.andP;  And just about any other Mac-related gadget imaginable.andP;  Therewere even a few network-oriented deals, too.andP;  Of course, you had to bewilling to wade through the crowds that included, much to many corporateattendees' dismay, month-old babies to four- and five-year-old tykes--inother words, those just old enough to wander and get separated from theirparents.andM;What other computer show features lost child announcements over the P.A.andO;system?andP;  Most shows limit attendance to adults 16 or 18 and over.andP;  (Andwisely so; few under-18-year-olds have the funds to purchase expensiveelectronics equipment.)andM;But let's be realistic and not call MacWorld a trade show--it's an end-usershow, plain and simple; even the show organizers appeared to accept thisnotion.andP;  Why else did they give attendees paper badges, rather than theembossed credit card-like plastic ones you see at real trade shows?andM;No one actually buys products at most electronics industry trade shows; theydo, however, become potential buyers when booth staffers run their badgesthrough a card reader that imprints their name and company information on aqualification form.andP;  The badges at MacWorld wouldn't have embossed wet toiletpaper.andP;  That's assuming they didn't immediately fall off the gimmicky clipthat came with them.andP;  (And if you lost your badge, you had to reregister, tothe tune of another $25 for the exposition).andM;Doing Something Right,andM;HoweverandM;Before this begins to sound too much like a knock on MacWorld, we have toadmit something right must be going on.andP;  Why else would 500 companies chooseto exhibit there?andP;  Why else would about 60,000 Mac fan(atic)s brave thepreviously mentioned terrors of the streets of San Francisco?andP;  (The SanFrancisco event is only one of nine such Mac-specific shows Mitch Hall Assoc.andO;puts on annually.)andM;As already mentioned, only a small percentage of the products exhibited atMacWorld were network-related.andP;  In fact, of the 54 vendors listed in theMacWorld program under &quot;Networking,&quot; only 14 were readily identifiable astruly networking companies.andM;For instance, Linotype, a computer typesetting vendor, was listed in thiscategory, as were Presentation Technologies, the maker of an image-processingsystem; WordPerfect; TeleTypesetting, another typesetting vendor; and amagazine for Mac programmers called MacTech Quarterly.andM;True networking companies, including Novell (Provo, Utah), DCA (Alpharetta,Ga.), Alisa Systems (Pasadena, Calif.), Cayman Systems (Cambridge, Mass.), CESoftware (West Des Moines, Iowa), Farallon (Emeryville, Calif.), and PacerSoftware (Westborough, Mass.), were listed.andP;  Curiously, Hewlett-Packard (PaloAlto, Calif.), which introduced several peripherals for AppleTalk networks,was not.andM;In any case, here are some of the new and/or revised network-relatedproducts/issues we found to be worth noting.andM;StatusMac: Dream orandM;Curse?andM;One of the more promising and, at the same time, troubling productannouncements at the San Francisco MacWorld was a Mac network-managementsoftware application called StatusMac.andP;  The product, from Pharos Technologies(Cincinnati), gives managers of Macintosh networks an intimate profile ofvirtually all the elements making up an end user's networked Mac.andM;With StatusMac, a network administrator can gather detailed information--forexample, size, utilization, type of hard disk, and type and revision levelsof applications software--about any Macintosh on an AppleTalk network.andO;Pharos president Bob Beech, in a presentation at the San Francisco Marriott,well away from the crush of the MacWorld show floors, said that StatusMacworks &quot;most elegantly&quot; in conjunction with Microsoft Mail version 2.0 but canalso operate as a standalone application to gather the detailed profiles ofnetworked Macintosh systems.andM;With StatusMac, a Mac network manager sends each user a profile request,asking users to run the profile program when their systems are free.andP;  Thisrequest can be sent via MS Mail's store-and-forward capabilities orStatusMac's own portable profiler.andM;After users execute the profile program, the data collected is automaticallysent back to the Mac manager's system and imported into a master database;the network manager can peruse this database from StatusMac or move it into aspreadsheet for additional analysis.andM;According to Beech, StatusMac helps the network manager identify hardware andsoftware conflicts before they cause problems, manage hardware and softwarestandards &quot;to ensure workgroup compatibility,&quot; track hardware and softwareassets, and verify software licensing compliance.andM;StatusMac collects a wide variety of information, including detailed profilesof an individual user's CPU and system files type/revision levels, the typesof add-on boards (i.e., network adapters) in the system, the kinds ofapplications--and their revision level--installed on a user's hard disk, thefonts and disk accessories (DAs) on users' systems, the volumes installed,INITs, and the sorts of SCSI devices attached to the network.andM;What StatusMac does not collect and allow the network manager to study isinformation about individual data files, Beech emphasized.andP;  Giving networkadministrators that level of information, he said, borders on an invasion ofprivacy--too close to Big Brother to be widely acceptable.andM;However, Beech did admit that it would be possible to provide that capabilitywith StatusMac.andP;  He could, for instance, foresee allowing a U.S.andP;  agency suchas the CIA to purchase a specially configured version of StatusMac that wouldallow the CIA's MIS manager to gather information about individual files.andP;  Insuch a high-security environment, he reasoned, it would make sense forsuperiors to control what data is and is not available on the network.andM;This form of maintenance would be unacceptable to most PC users, who areunaccustomed to dealing with MIS-type centralized control of all networkassets.andP;  For Macintosh users, who generally perceive themselves as even moreindependent than the typical PC user, it would be tantamount to a directinvasion of their civil rights.andM;Still, it is easy to understand why managers of Macintosh networks wouldcrave such a tool--very little else is available now.andP;  Beech called StatusMaca &quot;tremendous timesaver for Macintosh managers.andP;  Until now, inventory andanalysis of software and hardware on individual Macs has been tedious,inefficient, and, often, impossible.&quot;andM;Following demonstrations of StatusMac for potential customers, Beech said,Mac network managers have &quot;practically strangled me,&quot; demanding copies of theprerelease software.andP;  &quot;This allows them to be proactive as opposed toreactive,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It allows providing a reasonable prediction of what thenetwork's future needs will be.&quot;andM;Without StatusMac, Beech said, network managers are required to go from Macto Mac, individually checking out each system's configuration--trying tolearn what revision level of the Mac system software is in use, whether allusers have the same version of an application, etc.andP;  Obviously, this can beextremely time-consuming in large Mac networks.andP;  It is also ineffective, henoted, adding that it's almost impossible to collect and study configurationdata of hundreds of Macs this way.andM;StatusMac, on the other hand, can collect all this data from a single remotelocation and then allow &quot;feeding&quot; of information into analysis software.andM;The types of information StatusMac can collect include CPU and ROM version,RAM and RAM cache size, AppleTalk version, and availability of floating-pointprocessors.andP;  It can also collect volume and application names, version numberand size, the number, types, capacity, and addresses of SCSI devices, typesof fonts, and DAs installed and/or in use--in essence, just about everythinga network manager needs to know to manage a network of Macintoshes.andM;By working in conjunction with MS Mail, Beech said, StatusMac lets thenetwork manager and end user compromise about when to run the application.andO;In use, the manager's request to the user to run the StatusMac profileprogram is sent just like any other MS Mail message, and a pop-up &quot;new mail&quot;window appears on the user's screen.andM;This means end users can run the profile application then or later, when it'smore convenient or when they are not working on a time-critical project.andO;Letting the end user postpone running the profile program is a way to &quot;showsome sensitivity to personal issues,&quot; said Beech.andM;Depending on how comprehensive a profile request is, it takes a minute ormore to do.andP;  The information collected is then automatically returned via MSMail to the network manager.andM;Users not within an MS Mail system can be polled with a portable profilerthat works via file transfers between Macs and a server.andP;  The profile programcan also write its results to a floppy disk, which in turn can behand-carried to the network manager.andM;The network manager can then study the collected data via StatusMac's ownanalysis tools or import it to a spreadsheet such as Excel.andM;Beech believes StatusMac will find its strongest use in large corporationsthat want to maintain consistency of applications, ensure that all theirusers possess properly licensed applications, and manage the network'shardware resources.andM;&quot;We think that the first time you use the product, it will pay for itself,&quot;Beech claimed.andP;  Pricing of the product, to be available around July 10, hasyet to be set, although it will probably be based on a per-profile basis.andO;&quot;Considering the effectiveness of StatusMac, the value per profile will bevery attractive for networks of all sizes,&quot; said Beech.andM;A Modular ApproachandM;Asante Technologies (Sunnyvale, Calif.) has taken an innovative approach toproviding unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) Ethernet connections for theMacintosh: Realizing that the IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) 10BaseT proposal for UTPmay still undergo modifications before standardization, Asante has developedmodules that provide near-10BaseT capabilities but can be replaced ifnecessary when the standard is truly finalized.andM;Asante offers a wide range of network interface cards (NIC), includingnon-10BaseT Ethernet, thick and thin coax, and Token Ring, for the fullfamily of Macintoshes.andP;  At MacWorld, Asante introduced its MacCon+ET seriesof adapters, which support thick coax or the proposed 10BaseT UTP standard.andO;Included in this family of NICs are the MacCon+IIET, MacCon+SE30ET, andMacCon+SEET boards, which support the Macintosh II, SE30, and SE computers,respectively.andM;Asante said that these adapters offer register-level compatibility withApple's EtherTalk cards Phase One and Two.andP;  In addition, the MacCon+IIET andMacCon+SE30ET NICs provide 32-bit data transfers that maximize the power ofthe Mac.andP;  These adapters, available from Ingram Micro D or Macamerica, retailfor $495, the MacCon+SEET for $395.andM;The UTP versions of these adapters feature factory-replaceable modules thatcan be &quot;revved&quot; in the event the proposed 10BaseT standards undergosignificant modifications, noted Asante president Wilson Wong.andM;Database Front EndsandM;The development of database front ends for PCs involves more noise thanaction.andP;  In the Mac world, database front ends are quietly and steadilycoming to market.andP;  Three companies announced methods of connecting MicrosoftExcel to relational databases.andM;Microsoft (Redmond, Wash.) announced that Excel for the Mac will offer CL/1support.andP;  Apple's CL/1, or Connectivity Language/1, is a query languagerooted in SQL.andP;  Support for CL/1 will permit Excel users to access andretrieve information from corporate databases without having to be familiarwith the intricacies of CL/1.andP;  Few Mac users will want to learn the oddsyntax of CL/1 or SQL.andM;Once the file macro is installed, Mac users can access host residentinformation using familiar database functions and commands of Excel.andP;  Theuser specifies the host and database, then reviews the fields of informationfrom the host database.andP;  He can then copy the host data to his Mac, useExcel's SET command to set the query criteria, and extract the information.andO;Once this data is down-loaded into Excel, they can perform various analyticalfunctions.andP;  Or, they can write SQL queries directly, if that is preferable.andM;Excel users can now access IBM's DB2, VMS/Rdb, Oracle, Ingres, Informix, andSybase databases.andP;  However, there currently is no way for Mac users toextract data from SQL Server, Microsoft's own OS/2 database server.andP;  The CL/1capability is available to all registered users of Excel 2.2 for $9.95.andO;Starting in June, support for CL/1 will be included in all Excel packages.andM;Fairfield Software, a custom software house amid the corn fields ofFairfield, Iowa, released version 1.2 of Clear Access, its first commercialproduct.andP;  Clear Access gives Mac users a consistent method of accessing localand remote databases.andP;  Mac users only have to point, click, and choose tobring data into an applications program on the Mac.andP;  Because it is a deskaccessory, users can run Clear Access under Finder and MultiFinder.andP;  ClearAccess hides the different variations of CL/1 used by the database vendors,so users do not have to be familiar with CL/1 or SQL type queries.andM;Version 1.2 adds support for local databases as well as Oracle.andP;  Userscontinue to have access to Informix/SQL, Sybase, VMS/Rdb, Ingres, and DB2.andM;Version 1.2 has an improved query builder that supports wider table andcolumn names.andP;  Fairfield Software took some cues from the newspaper business.andO;It examined what column widths were easier for people to read and thenincorporated them into its product.andM;The query builder lists the information in the database and then builds anSQL-type query for you as you click on the items you want.andP;  It displays itemsin SQL statements vertically, rather than horizontally, which makes thestatements more easy to understand.andM;Query results can be placed in the Clipboard, into any application, or intoone of several standard file formats.andP;  Users can record a script, automatingmundane procedures.andP;  A single copy costs $349.andP;  A 10-user pack costs $2,799.andM;Clear Access and Excel bring CL/1 to Mac users who are not programmers;SequeLink is clearly intended for programmers.andP;  SequeLink, from TechGnosis isa development platform for Mac-to-VAX applications.andP;  TechGnosis, a Belgiancompany with offices in Boca Raton, Fla., has extended SequeLink to allowExcel users to access SQL databases.andP;  It does not support CL/1.andM;SequeLink for Excel consists of two parts.andP;  The Excel Call function is usedto address a library of eight external routines.andP;  These routines connect theuser to any SequeLink Server platform, execute SQL statements, and funneldata back into the spreadsheet.andM;The second part is a menu-driven, macro-based shell.andP;  It providesgeneral-purpose query capabilities right out of the shrink-wrapped box.andP;  Italso functions as a platform for defining customized solutions.andP;  SequeLinkshields developers from the details of networks while writing client-serverapplications.andM;SequeLink supports connections to Oracle, Ingres, Sybase, and Rdb databases.andO;Pricing is based on the number of workstations that require simultaneousaccess to the server.andP;  A typical Mac/VAX installation costs $4,995 for theserver module, and $195 to $695 for each workstation.andP;  TechGnosis has similarproducts for HyperCard, SuperCard, and 4th Dimension.andM;Novell's RoleandM;Novell recently licensed the FastPath to Shiva and its LocalNet cards toDayna.andP;  But this doesn't mean Novell isn't interested in the Mac marketplace.andO;At Macworld, Novell illustrated how well it juggles different networkingprotocols with a literal demonstration.andP;  Jugglers kept blue balls, red balls,apples, and bowling balls in the air, even while riding unicycles.andM;Novell recently announced a Mac development site in Walnut Creek, Calif.,andO;where the company will continue to develop Mac support for NetWare, accordingto a prepared statement by Steve Nelson, the director of marketing atNovell-Walnut Creek.andP;  Novell plans to deliver a NetWare 386 AFP module duringthe third quarter of 1990 that will permit Mac users on NetWare 386.andM;Novell announced a new release of its LAN WorkPlace for Macintosh, softwarethat allows Macs to function in a TCP/IP environment.andP;  Release 1.1 broadenscharacter set support, increases screen display size, and expands the printscreen function.andM;Under the terms of the Shiva agreement, Novell will no longer manufacture andmarket FastPath, a Local-Talk-to-EtherTalk gateway, although it will retainthe technology license.andP;  As of June 1, Shiva will manufacture, sell, support,and continue the development of the newly christened Shiva FastPath.andM;Users of FastPath should be happy to hear of the change.andP;  Somewhere duringthe acquisition of Kinetics by Excelan and Excelan by Novell, FastPath fellbetween the cracks.andP;  Dan Schwinn, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-basedShiva, plans to &quot;get the product back on track.&quot;andP;  There are problems withFastPath's &quot;perceived reliability,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Installations with more than100 units have problems.&quot;andP;  Shiva plans to get users of earlier versions ofthe gateway upgraded to the most current version, FastPath4.andM;Shortly before Macworld, Novell announced that Dayna Communications (SaltLake City, Utah) will take over production of Novell's LocalTalk adapters forNetWare for Macintosh.andP;  Dayna's DL2000 will replace Novell's NL1000 LocalTalkadapter, and the DL/2 will replace Novell's announced, but not yet shipping,NL/2 LocalTalk adapter.andP;  Dayna will also assume support for the NL1000,DL2000, and DL/2.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
