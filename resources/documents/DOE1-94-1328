For this purpose oflow-NO/sub x/ firing systems were developed and tested which achievea reduction of NO/sub x/ emissions by at least 40% compared with conventionalfiring systems. In pursuance of the energy-political objectives, developmentconcentrated on the fuel coal. In the meantime, these firing systemshave proved successful in full-scale operation in a few plants. The operatingexperience gained shows that the emission standards of the Grossfeuerunganlagen-Verordnungcan be met by primary measures and under certain conditions even lowervalues can be achieved. There are still restrictions for smaller plantsand certain fuel qualities. Further development of firing systems aimingat a still greater reduction of NO/sub x/ emissions is being activelypursued. The developed low-NO/sub x/ firing systems are used in new plantsand, in many cases, also in existing plants by retrofitting. These primarymeasures do frequently not suffice to attain the NO/sub x/ levels establishedby the Conference of Secretaries of State for Environment in a resolutionof April 5, 1984 for limiting NO/sub x/ emissions form large firing systems.Rather, the basic assumption is made that both in new plants and existingplants to be operated for an unlimited period of time of a furnace heatinput of more than 300 MW secondary measures for reducing nitrogen oxidelevels will have to be adopted in addition to the primary furnace-orientedmeasures. The costs for NO/sub x/ removal form the flue gas are normallyconsiderably higher than for combustion modifications. With 20 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
