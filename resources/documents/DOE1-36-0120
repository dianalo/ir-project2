A comparison is madebetween calculations and experimental data on the effect of the layupstructure on the tensile strength of rectangular specimens of layeredboron and carbon composites with free edges. The structural parametersfor which near-edge interlayer stresses are comparable with stressesapplied to the specimen are determined. 20 references.</TEXT></DOC>
