EDS is a division ofGM.andM;EDS' contract to run Viable expires in August of 1992.andP;  As of last month theArmy and Navy were discussing a tentative plan in which the Army would turnthe Viable hardware over to the Navy Regional Data Automation Centers.andM;&quot;I don't think anyone in the Navy could run the NARDACs [with Viable hardwareadded to the centers] as well as eDS could,&quot; the Navy official said.andM;&quot;It's obvious why IBM would be against SBIS,&quot; the Army official said.andP;  &quot;Atleast half of all the processing done at the centers being consolidated isIBM-world processing.andP;  If the consolidation goes ahead, they certainly standto gain.&quot;andM;Spokesmen for IBM and EDS had no immediate comment.andM;A Boeing official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said seniorcompany executives were interested in a Viable replacement contract until OSDmoved last fall to establish corporate information management (CIM) acrossthe services.andP;  At that point, the Army's SBIS plan became unrealistic, hesaid.andM;He said the CIM imperative to consolidate like requirements &quot;took the urgencyout of the [Army's] problem of finding a way to replace Viable.&quot;andM;Without that sense of urgency, he said, Boeing has no reason to believe therewill ever be an SBIS program.andP;  &quot;We don't put any time or resources on it,because we don't think it's going to be real,&quot; he said.andM;The CIM and consolidation efforts are being led by the DOD Comptroller'sOffice under the supervision of the deputy comptroller for IRM, CynthiaKendall.andP;  In an interview earlier this year, Kendall said she thought jointservice requirements being developed by functional experts in seven differentprocessing categories probably would not lead to open systems solutions forthe first systems developed under CIM.andM;Earlier this month, Hilmes told OSD officials they ought to consider usingSBIS as a vehicle to move DOD into open systems for joint servicesadministrative processing [GCN, July 9].andM;An Army systems manager who is viewing the consolidation debate from outsideWashington said OSD's current plan is not taking into account the power ofpersonal computers.andP;  &quot;OSD tends to see things from a perspective that isbroad and large.andP;  They don't know what is possible to accomplish in costcontainment down here at the local level with PCs in an open system,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;It's too bad,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;They're missing out on the power of a situationwhere you have a guy who does data entry on a spreadsheet somewhere but hasthe ability to introduce changes and ideas to the process....andP;  You know,that's the way you sometimes end up with an idea that saves the Army $10million.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
