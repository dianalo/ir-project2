The St. Louis-based concern was ordered by the jury to pay $16.2 million in punitive damages to 65 plaintiffs. This quite preposterous case is where the tort liability crisis has taken the American legal system.    At issue in the Monsanto trial, which lasted a record three years and eight months, was whether the plaintiffs were harmed when a rail car spilled 19,000 gallons of a wood-preserving chemical -- orthochlorophenol -- and minute traces of dioxin over a half-mile stretch of their town. The Sturgeon 65 reported various ailments from the spill, including headaches, insomnia, depression and a host of related maladies.    The plaintiffs' case was built largely on the testimony of a Chicago doctor -- an expert witness whose speciality is toxic tort cases. The doctor saw that each of the plaintiffs received a thorough test for dioxin, but the tests yielded no evidence of the chemical in their blood. Even so, he testified that the plaintiffs' ailments stemmed from the dioxin exposure.    After considering the doctor's testimony and that of almost 200 other witnesses, and examining some 6,000 exhibits, the jury concluded that the plaintiffs suffered no ill effects from the spill. Yet it awarded the Sturgeon 65 a multimillion-dollar judgment.    Even more confounding was the explanation of one of the jurors, Barbara Wettig, of how she and her jurymates squared the inconsistency of their verdict: &quot;We couldn't prove that the dioxin caused these people's illness,&quot; she said, &quot;but they (the plaintiffs) did prove that there was dioxin in the rail car, and that Monsanto had known that there was dioxin in the tank car.&quot;    What this says is that the jury found Monsanto innocent of harming the plaintiffs, but guilty of knowing that a teaspoon of dioxin was being carried on a rail car through the town of Sturgeon.    We suspect that this extraordinary verdict had less to do with the jury's deliberations on the case's merits than it did with the jury's exasperation. Indeed, one of Miss Wettig's jurymates, Evelyn McDougler, complained bitterly after the trial that she was &quot;ganged up on&quot; by Miss Wettig and other jurors who wanted her to sign off on the judgment even though she sided with Monsanto. The other jurors, she said, were determined not to let the case end in a mistrial after devoting nearly four years of their lives to it. Ms. McDougler said she finally acquiesced, fearing that her bad health would deteriorate further if the case dragged on any longer.    Even without the jury infighting and controversial verdict, this trial was an almost too-perfect illustration of how perverse the judicial process has become in many jurisdictions in this country. There were questionable maneuverings from the start. The suit was originally filed with the circuit court in Boone County, Mo., the jurisdiction in which Sturgeon is located. But it was withdrawn by the plaintiffs' lawyers when a survey of potential jurors suggested there might be small but significant opposition to a large damage award. The lawsuit was refiled with the circuit court in St. Clair (where the orthochlorophenol was produced by one of Monsanto's plants) -- a locale that the plaintiffs' lawyers felt would be more sympathetic to their claims.    The public interest is badly served when liability claims are allowed to clog up the courts in this manner. Many cases were delayed for months in the St. Clair County circuit court while the Monsanto case was heard. St. Clair County is hardly unique. Other court systems around the country are similarly bogged down and gridlocked with tort suits.    There was no real winner in the Monsanto trial (it is hard to imagine that the judgment against the chemical company won't be overturned on appeal). But there was a big loser -- public respect for the American legal system. When the wheels of justice spin pointlessly, as they did in St. Clair County circuit court for the past four years, the public is further confirmed in its belief that a courtroom has become mainly a place where lawyers toss arguments around like dice on a crap table. The verdicts in these tort liability suits are seen to have more in common with state lotteries than with state justice. </TEXT></DOC>
