Exxon said that negotiations were continuing, however, and that it probably would sell the building by year's end. The company wants to unload the property before year's end because the new tax law, effective Jan. 1, will impose a higher capital-gains tax.    Bids received on the 53-story building, known as the Exxon building, were rejected Wednesday. Exxon declined to say how many offers it received for the property.    But real estate industry sources said that Shuwa Investment Co., a Japanese concern, was the highest bidder, offering about $550 million for the building. Shuwa recently bought the headquarters of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s American Broadcasting Cos. unit, an office tower only a few blocks away from the Exxon building.    Other bidders were said to include Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., Prudential Insurance Co. of America and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. </TEXT></DOC>
