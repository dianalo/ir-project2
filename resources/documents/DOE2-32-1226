The overall objective of the European programmeis to have the option of fully commercialised fast reactors availableto replace existing thermal reactors when they are retired in the earlydecades of the next century. The immediate objectives are:-to reducecapital costs without reducing current safety margins, to improve operationalreliability, reduce fuel cycle costs, and to meet the safety standards.These objectives are all discussed, along with fast reactors worldwide,and the future of the fast reactor.
