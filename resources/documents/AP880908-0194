Shultz accusedIraq on Thursday of ``unjustifiable and abhorrent'' use of chemicalweapons against its minority Kurdish population.   In a 50-minute meeting with a senior Iraqi diplomat, SadoonHamadi, Shultz threatened to reverse the recent improvement in U.S.relations with the Middle Eastern country if human rights abusescontinuesd.   ``The secretary asked that the Iraqi government weight thisfactor fully in its decision-making,'' said State Departmentspokesman Charles E. Redman.   On Capitol Hill, meantime, Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill to slapeconomic sanctions on Iraq.   Redman, in a statement issued after the meeting, said Shultz``conveyed to Iraqi Minister of State Hamadi our view that Iraq'suse of chemical weapons in its military campaign against IraqiKurds is unjustifiable and abhorrent.''   A U.S. official said Shultz also used the word ``horrifying''todescribe the situation.   With chants of pro-Kurdish demonstrators ringing in his ears,Hamadi denied the charges in a brief news conference outside thedepartment building.   ``This is absolutely baseless and this has not taken place atall,'' he said.   Hamadi denounced the Democratic Party Union, a Kurdish groupheaded by Jalal Talabani, as terrorists who collaborated with Iranin the eight-year Persian Gulf war. He said Kurdish refugees whohave taken sanctuary in Turkey were free to return home.   Shultz's session with Hamadi initially was scheduled to surveyefforts to end the Iran-Iraq war. A U.S. official said Shultzlistened without comment to a report by Hamadi on sputteringnegotiations being held under United Nations auspices.   The official, who demanded anonymity, said there was noindication the U.S. dispute was Iraq over chemical weapons washaving a spillover effect on the negotiations.   Shultz told Hamadi that the United States would explore withfriendly governments ways to influence Iraq to cease chemicalwarfare practices ``which are unacceptable to the civilized world.''   State Department officials declined to say what those measuresmight be.   The bill introduced by Pell, D-R.I., would cut off economiccredits to Iraq, require the United States to vote against loans toIraq in international financial institutions and prohibitimportation of Iraqi oil.   Pell, in a statement, said the sanctions would remaion in place``as long as Iraq uses poisonous gas in violation of the 1925Geneva Protocols and as long as Iraq's campaign of genocide againstthe Kurdish people continues.''   Spokesman Redman refused to say how the United States obtainedits incriminating evidence against Iraq. However, he said a U.S.embassy official in Turkey had traveled through areas in whichKurdish refugees gained sanctuary.   Earlier this week, the State Department said it had no evidenceto substantiate widespread reports that Iraq employed cyanide andother chemical weapons against entire Kurdish villages.   Thousands of Kurds fled to Turkey, which in the past has hadstrains with its own Kurdish population. But Redman said Turkey hadbeen very hospitable to the refugees, creating new villages tohouse them.   ``The United States is convinced that Iraq has used chemicalweapons in its military campaign against Kurdish guerrillas,'' hesaid. ``We don't know the extent to which chemical weapons havebeen used, but any use in this context is abhorrent andunjustifiable.''   The spokesman added: ``We have expressed our strong concern tothe Iraqi government, which is well aware of our position that useof chemical weapons is totally unjustifiable and unacceptable. Thesecretary will be raising this issue with the Iraqi minister ofstate.''   In the past, the State Department also accused Iraq of usingchemical weapons against Iranian troops in the eight-year PersianGulf war.   Iraq has consistently denied the charges.   The session with Hamadi was scheduled before reports circulatedlast weekend that Iraqi troops had slain hundreds of Kurdishsurvivors of gas attacks.   On Tuesday, the ruling Revolutionary Command Council in Baghdadannounced a ``general and comprehensive'' amnesty for Kurdishrebels in an apparent effort to counter the poison gas allegations.   A spokesman for the Iraqi embassy here denied the reports, whichhe said were being spread by Kurdish leaders in Euorpe, far fromthe claimed disaster scene.   He said the Iraqi army was taking up positions that had beenoccupied ``by people who collaborated with the enemy in the past.''   The spokesman, Abul Rahman Jamal, said some of them may havebeen Kurds or Arabs. ``They collaborated with the Iranians andfacilitated their movement into the country,'' he said.   Jamal also said Western newspapers had ``blown up'' reportscirculated by a handful of Kurdish leaders who were touring Europe,``trying to air accusations'' against Iraq.   The Kurds, a non-Arab people, are a stateless minority in Iraq,Iran, Turkey and other countries in the area.   On Wednesday, referring to the Kurds' quest for autonomy, Redmanappeared to rule out U.S. support for statehood.   ``Our policy is that the Kurds should satisfy their aspirationspeacefully within the framework of the existing states of the areaand that it is a matter that has to be worked out between the Kurdsand the respective governments,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
