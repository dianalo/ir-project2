The planned demonstration, which would have been the first overt political protest since winter 1986, when students around the country rallied for democracy, fizzled quickly after the government interrupted a campus rally Tuesday night to read a message warning that demonstrations were illegal and urging students not to take part. That message was repeated the following morning in the Beijing Daily and on radio broadcasts. By yesterday afternoon, the campus was quiet, and seems likely to remain so.    This determined effort to stop student demonstrations reflects a fear among Chinese leaders that campus upheavals could spark widespread public unrest. Across China, people are disgruntled over rising prices and rampant government corruption, which some Chinese see as the most visible fruits of a decade of economic reform. Urban workers, who have been hardest hit by inflation, which rose 11% the first quarter, are a special source of concern to Chinese officials.    Ironically, as Soviet leaders have begun talking about democracy as a means to encourage public acceptance of their new economic reforms, Chinese leaders increasingly see demands for democracy as a threat to sustaining their economic reform program.    Student demands for Western-style democracy and their open criticism of the Communist Party clash with the party's cherished principles of upholding socialism and maintaining the party's absolute power. Reforms are seen as a necessary step toward modernizing China's backward economy, not as a step toward capitalism or democracy.    This latest round of student unrest began last week, when students marched to protest lax security, which they said was responsible for the murder of a fellow student. That protest quickly led to calls for democracy, human rights and free speech.    The mood on campus was tense Tuesday as student leaders spoke before hundreds, urging them to take to the streets. Students with flashlights jostled one another to read scores of wall posters criticizing the Communist Party and demanding democratic rights. But the mood changed when a government announcement was broadcast over the campus loudspeakers warning that demonstrations are illegal. There was stunned silence. Then some students began filtering back to their dormitories.    Sources said that the Politburo of the Communist Party held an emergency meeting Tuesday night and decided all student protesters would be arrested and expelled from school, and that the police would be out in force yesterday.    They were. By yesterday afternoon, many student protesters were disheartened to see a new poster on campus. This one, signed by the &quot;Action Committee,&quot; the leadership of the protest movement, said that the committee had disbanded and its members wouldn't be involved in protests any longer. </TEXT></DOC>
