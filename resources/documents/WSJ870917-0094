The oil company said last month that it would offer about a 35% stake at $19 to $22 a share. Union Texas is 50%-owned by Allied-Signal Inc., Morristown, N.J., and 50%-owned by two partnerships controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., New York. Each will own about 33% after the offering.    A company spokeswoman said underwriters led by First Boston Corp. changed the price range because of current market conditions.    Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay $185 million of senior bank debt and for working capital. The company didn't specify the expected proceeds after the price revision. It previously predicted proceeds of $551 million to $638 million. As of June 30, the company had $710 million of long-term debt outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
