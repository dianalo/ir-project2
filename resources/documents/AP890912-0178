Democrats stuck with their proposal, which would beef uptreatment, prevention and law enforcement initiatives, saying it wasa badly needed response to the growing problem of illegal drug useand drug-related violence.   Administration officials talked of a possible veto as Bush made alive televised appeal from the White House to millions ofschoolchildren, urging them to stay away from drugs and telling themthat refusing drugs ``won't make you a nerd.''   ``I'm asking you to not to look the other way,'' Bush said. ``I'masking you to find someone who needs you. And offer to help. I'llsay it again: If you're not in trouble, help someone who is.''   Democrats said they would finance their proposal withacross-the-board cuts in hundreds of federal programs, and sought tograft the proposal to an unrelated appropriations bill on the Senatefloor.   White House officials met privately with Senate Republicanleaders as both sides held closed-door meetings on the latest roundof political maneuvering over the drug issue.   ``We're going to see how strongly Byrd feels about this and we'regoing to ask for negotiations,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Doleof Kansas said about the Democratic proposal sponsored by SenateAppropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.   Dole's comments followed a one-hour meeting in his Capitol officeattended by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, administrationbudget director Richard Darman, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, drugcoordinator William J. Bennett and several top GOP senators.   Alternatives to Byrd's package, including a $1.8 billion plansponsored by a Democrat and a Republican, emerged elsewhere onCapitol Hill.   Bennett told a House committee the administration envisioned itsefforts costing $50 billion over five years, while a Senate panelapproved a Pentagon spending bill with more than $1 billion foranti-drug efforts.   The White House's Office of Management and Budget distributed astatement saying that Bush had ``made the tough choices'' when heunveiled his $7.9 billion anti-drug plan last week. Bush's top drugadvisers will urge the president to veto the Democraticdrug-fighting proposal, OMB said.   ``The proposed `Emergency Drug' amendment makes no choices,'' thestatement said. ``It throws money at the problem rather thanproviding a plan.''   Democrats held their ground.   ``We're not waiting for an invasion,'' Byrd said. ``The invasionhas already begun.''   Byrd, with the support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, offered the package as an amendment to a bill providing$11.9 billion for transportation programs for fiscal 1990, whichbegins Oct. 1.   To raise the money for the drug initiatives, Democrats proposedslicing 0.575 percent off most defense and domestic programs,exempting Social Security, Medicare and other benefits.   But administration officials objected, saying that would resultin a $1.8 billion cut in defense spending ``way out of proportion''to the cutbacks that domestic programs would suffer.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters there that theDemocratic plan was like taking ``a simple meat ax'' to the DefenseDepartment's budget and said ``it would create ... havoc.''   Republicans also objected to the way the Democratic proposalwould distribute its extra funds: 53 percent for law enforcement and47 percent for treatment and prevention efforts.   ``That, of course, changes the president's entire drug program,''said Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas.   The Democratic plan would increase the federal anti-drug budgetby $3.9 billion above the amount Congress had planned to spend, Byrdsaid.   The new spending would include $1.1 billion for drug and alcoholtreatment, $1 billion for new prisons, $200 million to help stateand local law enforcement agencies, $97 million for the FBI and $100million for public housing authorities to fight drug problems.   Bennett's prediction before the House Foreign Affairs Committeethat administration anti-drug efforts would cost $50 billion overfive years was met with objections from several members, who said itwould be unacceptable for the administration to find those funds byshifting money out of other vital domestic programs.   The committee chairman, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., told Bennett:   ``I don't want to see one dime diverted from from essentialdomestic purposes that are in fact part of the drug problem. I thinkthat would be a tragic mistake.''   Elsewhere:   _The Senate Appropriations commerce, justice and statesubcommittee approved a measure that would cut defense and manydomestic programs by 0.225 percent and use the $1.8 billion raisedto pay for anti-drug law enforcement programs. The provision,adopted on a voice vote, was sponsored by subcommittee ChairmanErnest Hollings, D-S.C., and the panel's ranking Republican, WarrenRudman, R-N.H.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Hollings' proposalwould cut $675 million from the Pentagon's budget, an amountFitzwater said was tolerable.   ``We have told Hollings we would reluctantly support hiscompromise,'' Fitzwater said.   _The Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee approved a $279.7billion military spending bill for next year containing $1.05billion for drug efforts _ eight times the $132 million Bush hadrequested.   The package includes a transfer of $300 million in cash andequipment to the Coast Guard, $118 million for existing DefenseDepartment drug-treatment and education programs, $60 million forsurveillance planes and ships and $40 million for the National Guard.   _Top administration drug officials and a congressional staffreport said officials ought to focus on developing strategicinformation on Colombian cocaine cartels, rather than on immediatebusts and asset seizures, to nail entire organizations.   ``Long-term cases which produce continuing intelligence data thatcan be used to dismantle whole organizations are favored overbuy-bust type cases,'' William Baker, the FBI's assistant directorfor intelligence, told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee onInvestigations.   To the cartels, Baker said, the arrests of low-level non-criticalcartel employees and the daily seizure of multihundred kilograms ofcocaine ``are merely the costs of doing business.''</TEXT></DOC>
