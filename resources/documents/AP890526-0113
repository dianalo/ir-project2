Diplomats say nearly the entire military high command was killedin the three-day revolt crushed May 18 and subsequent purge in thisstrategic nation that is the Soviet Union's strongest ally inAfrica.   The new appointees will command the continent's largest andbest-equipped force of 325,000 troops, although many are unwillingconscripts.   All but two of the new military leaders are central committeemembers of the Marxist Workers Party of Ethiopia, this Horn ofAfrica nation's sole legal political party.   Lt. Gen. Addis Tedla, the deputy prime minister and a Politburomember, is the new chief of staff.   Other appointees with their new titles are Maj. Gen. SeyoumMekonen and Maj. Gen. Mesfin Gebre Kal, deputy chiefs of staff; andMaj. Gen. Embibel Ayele, commander of ground forces.   Brig. Gen. Alemayehu Agonafir becomes air force commander whileYfhuwal Ashet Girma was named navy commander with the rank of rearadmiral.   Berhanu Jembere, a former ambassador to East Germany who has hadcharge of the government agency dealing with drought and otherdisasters, takes command of the 1st Army with the rank of majorgeneral.   Other appointments are: Maj. Gen. Gimar Neway, to head thepolice; Maj. Gen. Wubishet Dessie, 2nd Army commander; and Brig.Gen.

HaileGiorgis Habte Mariam, who was killed by rebellious generals when hetried to halt their coup attempt.   The government made no mention of casualties in the mutiny.   Initially it was announced that loyal troops killed threegenerals: Maj. Gen. Merid Negussie, then chief of staff; Maj. Gen.Amha Desta, air force commander; and Maj. Gen. Denissie Bulto, 2ndArmy commander. But Mengistu told a rally last week that the threecommitted suicide rather than surrender.   Mengistu has blamed the three dead generals for military defeatsin northern Eritrea and Tigre provinces, where it is fightingrebels who want more power for their ethnic minorities.   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front, waging a 28-year war forsecession, and the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, which seeksmore autonomy, recently have scored major victories and chasedgovernment troops from most of the countryside and small towns.   Many troops in the 150,000-strong 2nd Army, which has done mostof the fighting and has its headquarters in the Eritrean capital ofAsmara, backed the coup.</TEXT></DOC>
