As recently as March 23, Charles J. Zwick, chairman andchief executive officer of Miami-based Southeast, said thebank holding company would be profitable this year, and manybanking analysts had expected Southeast to turn a modestprofit in the second quarter.</LP><TEXT>   But Friday, the company disclosed that the credit qualityof its large South Florida loan portfolio is much lower thanpreviously believed.   The bleak outlook sent Southeast stock tumbling Friday to$11, down $2.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange compositetrading.   Southeast said it would take several steps to shore up itsbalance sheet. First, the company slashed its quarterlydividend by 64%, to 10 cents a share from 28 cents a share.The dividend is payable July 17 to shares of record June 25.The last time Southeast cut its dividend was 1976.   Second, the company said it reached a preliminaryagreement to sell certain assets of its mortgage subsidiaryto Sears Mortgage Corp., a unit of Sears Roebuck andamp; Co. Thetransaction, if completed, would include Southeast'sresidental mortgage servicing portfolio, a number of branchoffices of the mortgage unit and other assets and wouldresult in a payment to Southeast of as much as $100 million,the firm said.   Southeast said it is looking for other &quot;significant costsavings,&quot; including the possibility of deferring some capitalprojects.   Third, Southeast said it is adding between $2 million and$22 million to its loan-loss reserve, raising its totalprovision for bad loans to a projected $260 million to $280million by June 30 from $258 million March 31. The increasereflects a surge in nonperforming assets. The company said itexpects its total nonperforming loans to range between $600million and $620 million by June 30, up at least 26% sinceMarch 31.   Loan-loss reserves are a fund that banks set aside tooffset expected losses from bad loans. Nonperforming assetsare loans that have been foreclosed upon or are more than 90days past due.   Southeast didn't elaborate on its projected results forthe second quarter or year except to say that neither periodwill be profitable. In the 1989 second quarter, Southeast hadnet income of $32.3 million, or $1 a share. For all of 1989,it had net of $80.5 million, or $2.42 a share.   &quot;The condition of Florida's economy has not improved andcontinues to adversely affect the loan porfolio,&quot; Mr. Zwicksaid. But, he said, &quot;The situation now is better than it wasin the mid-'70s,&quot; the time of the last severe slump inFlorida real estate.   Cheryl Swaim, a banking analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co.,said Southeast's loan portfolio is deteriorating faster thanshe expected. In addition to the Florida real estateproblems, she said, Southeast added a $55 million leveragedbuy-out loan to its nonperforming category in the secondquarter. Before Friday, Ms. Swaim projected Southeast wouldearn between 25 cents and 30 cents a share in the secondquarter and at least break even in 1990.   Mr. Zwick confirmed that Southeast added an LBO loan toits nonperforming list in the period, but he wouldn'telaborate on the size of the loan or provide any otherdetails. He said 70% to 75% of Southeast's nonperformingassets are from real estate loans, with the rest fromcommercial credit.   John J. Mason, a banking analyst with Interstate/JohnsonLane, said he expects Southeast to record a roughly $50million capital gain from the sale of its residentialmortgage unit, compared with the gross price of as much as$100 million that Southeast said it should receive for theassets. The difference reflects Southeast's hefty investmentin acquiring the mortgage subsidiary, said Mr. Mason. &quot;Theypaid real money for that company,&quot; he said.   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it loweredits senior debt ratings for Southeast as well as thecompany's commercial paper rating. The rating service alsosaid it downgraded the ratings of long-term and short-termdeposits of the company's Southeast Bank N.A. unit.   The changes affect about $375 million of debt.</TEXT></DOC>
