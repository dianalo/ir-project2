A further programme provides forthe construction of large wind energy facilities between 100 and 150MW in the period 1986 to 1990. A table provides data on government funding,sizes of wind power plants (rotor surface, installed maximum output),individual projects, turbine manufacturers and research programme objectives.In addition, the author gives data on design and output details of differentprojects, individual sites of wind power plants and their wind conditions,and comments on technological problems (safety engineering, hydraulicsystems, corrosion, radio interference).
