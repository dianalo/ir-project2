Flow returned to the baseline level within 60 secondsfollowing release. Flow was also altered in a controlled fashion by otherinterventions. Recordings of Thallium uptake in the myocardium were displayedas a time histogram (counts per second squared vs time) which correlatedvery closely with electromagnetic flow probe recordings of flow (R=o.82-0.97).These experiments demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in Thallium infusionimaging to detect rapid changes in flow through a major coronary artery.</TEXT></DOC>
