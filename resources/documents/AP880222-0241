But getting the surface ready for the paint is another matter.Caulking cracks, countersinking popped nails, scraping blisteredand peeled areas, removing mildew, priming where necessary andperforming the other preparatory steps all add up to plain workwithout the visual compensation of the actual painting.   Yet you must perform the preliminary phase of the operation withsome degree of dedication or you will pay for it later.   A house not adequately prepared may look very much the same asone that has been given the full treatment, but it is only aquestion of time before the difference is seen.   The let's-get-it-over-with process begins to peel, blister,check or flake. The take-your-time-but-do-it-right formula paysdividends in the form of a continuous good appearance.   Poor paint, or the failure to handle the brush, roller or spraygun properly often gets the blame for what is nothing more thaninadequate preparation.   If you do not have the time or the inclination to get the houseready to paint, don't do it.   Check on whether the paint you plan to use will work well on thekind of surface you are covering. Oil-based, alkyds andoil-modified alkyds all are excellent for wood siding, but themajority of do-it-yourselfers prefer latexes because they haveblister resistance and, since water is the solvent, they makecleaning up a lot easier.   Once regarded as less likely to ``cover'' than other paints,they now have good hiding ability. Some can be applied even over adamp surface. Read the label on the container to see whether aprimer is required, especially if the latex is being put over anoil paint designed to chalk.   If brick or other masonry is being painted, be sure you have anexterior paint formulated for use on such surfaces. Oil paints donot work well on any material containing cement, which has analkali content that attacks the paint.   Exterior wood shakes or shingles usually are stained, althoughthey can be painted. Once they have been stained, they should bestained again when a second treatment is necessary. While you canpaint over stain at a later time, a careful priming is required toprevent bleeding. If you paint the first time, you cannot stainlater without removing the paint, which can be a messy job onshakes or shingles.   When covering this kind of wood when a house is new, look overthe various kinds of stains and pigmented sealers on the market.Manufacturers of some of the pigmented types say they are moredurable than the clear coatings. Incidentally, you can get finisheswith mildewcides in them or add a mildew-resistant compound toother finishes.   As you paint, follow the sun; that is, paint where the sun justhas been. In that way, you will not risk having the sun dry out thepaint too quickly. It's also a lot more comfortable painting whilein the shade.   If you are using an extension ladder, use it with caution. Mostaccidents occur when a person leans over too far. Instead, get downand move the ladder. It may be a little more trouble and take alittle more time, but it will keep you from getting hurt.   Work from the top of a house, usually in the left hand corner,and continue downward.   Always work in toward the wet paint, using wide, firm strokes.Dip the brush about halfway and pat off the excess on the side ofthe container. If you are using a roller, be sure it does not takeup too much paint and do not spin the roller at the end of astroke. With a roller, work from a dry area into a wet one.   Color changes the seeming appearance of a house. If you wantsomething to be inconspicuous, such as a garage door, paint it thesame color as the main part of the house. A house looks smallerwhen it is painted with dark colors. Light colors, of course, havethe opposite effect. When a house seems to be too tall, paint itthe same color as the roof. If you want it to seem higher, paintthe siding a contrasting color.   If you have been content with the colors on your house over theyears, don't experiment. Choose the same or nearly the same colors.</TEXT></DOC>
