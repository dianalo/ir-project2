The action comes only a month after ATandamp;T, the nation's No.1 long-distance carrier, said it would cut just its eveningrates an average of 2.5%, or $160 million annually. Under thenew plan, evening rates will drop 5%.</LP><TEXT>   But ATandamp;T last week said it would increase the size of itsprice cut, after the Federal Communications Commissionordered local phone companies to reduce the fees they chargeATandamp;T and other long-distance phone companies for originatingand terminating interstate phone calls.   That FCC-ordered reduction amounts to $1.1 billion overthe next 12 months -- about $696 million more than the localphone companies had proposed in April.   ATandamp;T's reduction applies to basic long-distance service,operator-handled calls, calls from the U.S. to Canada, andthe company's optional calling plan named Reach Out America.   For example, effective Sunday, price reductions ondirect-dialed, out-of-state calls will average 5% duringevening calling periods from Sundays through Fridays, andone-half percent during the day on weekdays. The Reach OutAmerica evening discount plan will drop to $7.80 a month from$8.15. And per-minute charges for operator-assisted callswill be cut an average of 3%.   The decrease is ATandamp;T's 11th since the comany's breakup in1984. Since then, longdistance prices have been reducedalmost 43%, ATandamp;T said.   ATandamp;T's primary rivals, MCI Communications Corp. ofWashington, D.C., and the US Sprint Communications Co. unitof United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo., saidthey will take whatever pricing action is necessary to staycompetitive with ATandamp;T's rates.</TEXT></DOC>
