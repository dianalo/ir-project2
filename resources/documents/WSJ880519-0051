An attorney who wasn't identified but was described as having a &quot;privileged professional relationship&quot; with Mr. Guez contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the threat, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Rudolph Giuliani.    On May 16, Mr. Guez, 43 years old, allegedly said, in the presence of the attorney, that he intended to kill Judge Lifland &quot;if a result contrary to his interests were to be reached,&quot; the criminal complaint said. The FBI was told Mr. Guez's tone and demeanor suggested this was a &quot;serious threat to the life of Judge Lifland,&quot; the complaint said.    At a hearing in U.S. District Court last night, Mr. Guez was detained without bail pending a hearing today on whether he should be incarcerated until a trial. If convicted, Mr. Guez faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a $5,000 fine.    &quot;I did not threaten anyone. I am astonished to see that I'm accused of this,&quot; Mr. Guez said at last night's hearing.    Mr. Guez's arrest came yesterday at court proceedings in which Judge Lifland approved the sale of the Sasson trademark for $8 million to Stanwich Partners Inc., an investment firm based in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Guez was not inside the courtroom when he was taken into custody by an FBI agent.    Mr. Guez, of Old Westbury, N.Y., also is currently under indictment and awaiting trial for allegedly assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal who tried to seize Sasson records last year at the posh $5.5 million Manhattan townhouse where Mr. Guez once resided.    Mr. Guez and his bankruptcy-law case have become widely known in the courts of Manhattan. In the past year or so he has been involved in a continuing round of court appearances and has employed many New York law firms in his effort to hold on to what is left of his company.    Sasson filed its bankruptcy-law petition Oct. 10, 1986. Founded in October 1976 as a maker of fashion jeans, the company became a successful licensing concern by the early 1980s; in 1984, sales peaked at more than $700 million.    Martin Siegel, Mr. Guez's lawyer, charged the arrest was part of a conspiracy to keep Mr. Guez out of bankruptcy court today when Judge Lifland is expected to approve a reorganization plan for Sasson.    Judge Lifland couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
