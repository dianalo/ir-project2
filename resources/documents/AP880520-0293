The group led by the British construction company Beazer PLC andthe investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. stated Thursdaythat about 73.2 percent of outstanding common shares and about 68.7percent of outstanding preferred shares had been tendered as ofWednesday under its $60 a share tender offer.   The group also extended its tender offer through midnight EDTWednesday.   The common shares tendered, together with 2.1 million commonshares already owned by related entities, represent about 75.2percent of the outstanding common shares, the Beazer groupindicated.   The group must acquire 85 percent of Koppers' shares in order tocomplete the deal under the anti-takeover law in Delaware, whereKoppers is incorporated.   Right now, the group may not purchase Koppers' shares underterms of federal court injunctions in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.   It appealed the Los Angeles ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in San Francisco, but a decision has not been announced.   Also Thursday, U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill said he wouldhold a hearing May 31 on the question of whether the hostile bidviolates federal securities rules.   The hearing specifically will address whether the $540 millionof preferred securities that the group plans to issue to Shearsonin return for $540 million of its financing should be consideredstock or debt.   Cohill said the tender offer as currently structured must bepermanently enjoined if the stock in question is found to be a debtsecurity. If that is the case, the Beazer group could restructurethe financing to comply with regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
