Newton used&quot;when he beat charges that he murdered Oakland police officer John Frey, Burrsaid.;   Defense attorney Alfons Wagner accused Oakland police and prosecutorsof &quot;fast and loose playing with witnesses&quot; who escaped criminal chargesthemselves while giving investigators statements that Robinson murdered Newtonon a West Oakland street to gain status in the Black Guerrilla Family prisongang.;   Robinson, 27, an admitted crack dealer who has spent most of hisadult life behind bars, contends he shot Newton three times after Newton firedat him first.;   Wagner said authorities are seeking a murder convictionrather than believing Robinson's self defense claim because they don't wantthe public to think they are being lenient toward the man responsible fortheir nemesis' death.;   In this case, authorities &quot;kiss off anything (pendingagainst witnesses) because the prosecution was going to look good in theprosecution of the guy who killed Huey Newton in this town of Oakland,&quot; Wagnertold the jury.;   But prosecutor Burr responded that the conspiracy theory wasfanciful and he told the jury he personally resented it.;   &quot;It implies I amdoing something improper, and illegal, and immoral,&quot; Burr said.;   Wagnercontends that the prosecution's key witness, Brian Keith Walton, lied instating he saw Robinson shoot Newton first while Newton's hands were in theair and then twice more through the head as he lay on the ground. Walton, afriend of Robinson's who died last year in an apparently unrelated drug-houseshooting, was facing an auto theft charge at the time he gave his tapedstatement to investigators.;   During the trial, Wagner also presented astring of witnesses to talk about violent incidents in Newton's past,including the killing of Frey -- in which a manslaughter conviction againstNewton was overturned -- and two other killings in which Newton wasimplicated. The evidence was shown to demonstrate a lifelong propensity forviolence in support of Robinson's contention that Newton was armed, eventhough police found no gun near Newton's body.;   Burr acknowledged thatNewton was a thorn in the side of local law enforcement for more than twodecades, a radical leader who &quot;had a way of pulling law enforcement's chain, away of kind of rubbing law enforcement's noses in it.&quot; Most importantly, hegot away with Frey's murder, in the eyes of Frey's fellow Oakland policeofficers.;   &quot;What better epitaph could the Oakland Police Department writethan that . . . he's fallen so low he was killed trying to rip off a crackdealer,&quot; Burr said. &quot;That sings.&quot;;   But in defending the investigation, Burrsaid, the evidence showed Robinson executed a defenseless Newton in the&quot;stupid&quot; belief he'd &quot;become somebody on the mean streets of West Oakland.&quot;;  Burr is expected to complete his statements to the jury today.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BARRY WITT, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911003  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  572  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 3, 199100277095,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
