Energy Secretary John Herrington said the action would &quot;assure that EPA, the states and DOE will see that the strongest possible standards will be met.&quot;    Critics have accused the Energy Department of polluting several of its nuclear-production facilities with large amounts of radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals. Previously, the Energy Department claimed that the Atomic Energy Act gave it exclusive authority to regulate mixtures of radioactive and non-radioactive wastes. It rejected attempts by the EPA to assert authority over mixed wastes at its facilities.    The Energy Department noted, however, that it retained regulatory authority over radioactive portions of its wastes. </TEXT></DOC>
