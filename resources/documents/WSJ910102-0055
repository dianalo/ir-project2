The dead &quot;may beCambodian farmers whose only `sin' is a desire for socializedmedicine to alleviate the suffering of their families andneighbors,&quot; he wrote from his summer house in Yakima,Washington.   The Supreme Court was in a pre-FAX era recess, but by 3the same afternoon Justice Thurgood Marshall managed to reachthe other seven justices by telephone. When he explained thebizarre situation, the other justices unanimously agreed thatJustice Douglas had gone too far. They nullified his order.Commander in Chief Nixon was able to continue the pullout oftroops without having to halt the air cover that saved manyU.S. lives.</LP><TEXT>   This story is worth recounting for more than JusticeDouglas's assessment of Vietnam as a war over socializedmedicine. We are now again on notice that a federal judgethinks he has the power to issue a legal writ to reverse adecision by the president on how to command the troops.   Harold Greene, a federal district court judge inWashington, D.C., last month issued a ruling in a case thatargued President Bush needed congressional approval to wagean &quot;offensive attack&quot; in the Persian Gulf. While Judge Greeneruled against the 54 Democratic congressmen-plaintiffs, hisopinion in the case does not give Mr. Bush much breathingroom.   Judge Greene, famous for his continuing role in the ATandamp;Tbreakup, said in Dellums v. Bush that &quot;an injunction mayissue at the request of members of Congress to prevent theconduct of war which is about to be carried on withoutcongressional authorization.&quot; He instructed Congress thatbefore issuing an injunction against Mr. Bush, all he needsis a sign that the case is &quot;ripe,&quot; which he defined as proofthat &quot;the plaintiffs in an action of this kind be orrepresent a majority of members of Congress.&quot;   This seems to mean that Judge Greene would issue aninjunction against war if half plus one of all congressmenjoin as plaintiffs to the lawsuit. Or he would issue theinjunction if Congress passes a resolution claiming solepower to start war.   A few words about the merits of this case. The power todeclare war -- with all the formalities this has entailedsince Grotius invented international law in 1625 -- belongsto Congress, but the Founders were careful to give thepresident the power to make war. There is no constitutionalrequirement of a formal declaration; Korea and Vietnam areleading examples of recent undeclared wars. Throughout itshistory of some 200 deployments of troops abroad, the U.S.has had but five declared wars. As a Washington LegalFoundation friend-of-the-court brief filed last month noted,even if the Founders wanted a president to consult Congressbefore launching a true offensive war -- an imperial war togain territory, for example -- it was Iraq that started thesehostilities.   The larger point is that of all the people to debate theconstitutional tug of war between Congress and the president,federal judges may be the least relevant. Indeed, this wasthe deciding factor in an opinion issued the same day asJudge Greene's by another judge in the same federal districtcourt in Washington.   Judge Royce Lamberth dismissed a case brought by aNational Guard reservist who claimed Mr. Bush didn't have thepower to order troops to the Persian Gulf. &quot;The court lacksthe expertise, resources and authority to explore&quot; issuessuch as what &quot;constitutes `war,' `imminent hostilities' oreven the prelude to offensive war,&quot; Judge Lamberth wrote.Which branch can order troops to battle should be resolvedpolitically, not by courts. Separation of powers requiresthat &quot;the far-reaching ramifications of those decisionsshould fall upon the shoulders of those elected by the peopleto make those decisions.&quot;   Judge Lamberth added that Congress has plenty of powers,lacking only the will to use them. &quot;Congress can itselfdeclare war, exercise its appropriations power to preventfurther offensive and/or defensive military action in thePersian Gulf or even impeach the president.&quot;   If the battle here between Judges Greene and Lamberth evergets to the appeals courts, bet on Judge Lamberth. Even someof the liberal judges on the federal appeals court inWashington have expressed doubts about judges issuing orderswhere Congress fears to tread.   &quot;Questions of military deployment are best settled by theinterplay of the political branches,&quot; said Judge (and formerRep.) Abner Mikva in a 1987 speech. &quot;When the two politicalbranches have not exhausted their own powers to settle thematter, the courts are well advised to take a page fromCongress -- and do nothing.&quot; Judge Mikva noted that judgesquickly dismissed all but one of the 20 legal challenges tothe Vietnam War. Maybe one day Judge Mikva will get a chanceto play Justice Marshall, with Judge Greene re-creating therole of Justice Douglas.   One legal commentator with plenty of experience in thisarea is Robert Bork. He was the solicitor general who in 1973won the reversal of Justice Douglas. As a judge, he wrote aleading federal appeals court opinion against judges givingthe political branches the standing to sue each other incourt.   &quot;In matters of such importance as possible war in theGulf, the courts have no place,&quot; Mr. Bork said after readingthe Greene and Lamberth decisions. &quot;This is a matter for thepolitical branches to decide. The president, and indeedCongress, should make this clear so that courts are nottempted to expand their authority into areas where it hasalways been understood not to exist.   &quot;The rules courts have created to restrict their ownpowers -- rules about political questions, standing, ripenessand so forth -- are designed to keep the courts in theirproper place in our democratic system. If courts show signsof ignoring these rules, of breaking out of their properauthority,&quot; Mr. Bork said, &quot;the political branches shouldtell the courts that they will have none of it.&quot;   Mr. Bork recognizes the political reasons why Mr. Bush hasrefrained from announcing he would ignore as unconstitutionalany injunction that bars the use of troops. While this wouldremove any hope Saddam Hussein may have for a reprieve fromthe judicial branch, this could also anger Congress intopursuing what could become a battle's second front -- afull-fledged legal fight against Mr. Bush's constitutionalpowers.   The last thing Mr. Bush or the troops need is a federaljudge trying to expand judicial power into foreign policy.The last thing Congress deserves is a judge stepping in sothat legislators can keep ducking responsibility for oragainst war. America may finally have found a public policyissue that can't be decided in court: war.</TEXT></DOC>
