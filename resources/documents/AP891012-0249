They found areliable woman to watch their 5-year-old son for $85 a week, eventhough that required getting special permission to enroll him in aschool near the care-giver's home three miles away.   ``And that's good for only one year,'' said Mrs. Jackle, 37, alibrarian who lives in Upper Darby, Pa., near Philadelphia. ``We'reeven contemplating moving, so we could be closer to where she is.''   The Jackles' scramble to find a trustworthy sitter for their5-year-old is a product of the growth in two-income families amongthe baby-boom generation. That, in turn, has created an enormousproblem for working parents nationwide: who takes care of the kidsand how to pay them?   ``Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd betterget set up before you get pregnant,'' said Louise Hurst, a licensedday-care professional who watches the Jackle boy and five otheryoung children in her home.   ``I've gotten lots of calls,'' said Mrs. Hurst, 43. ``I informthem I'm full until September 1991, so I don't even bother to takea waiting list.''   Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs havemultiplied, in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from asecond income. This has crimped budgets of millions of Americansand created an underground cash economy of unregulated care-givers.   Historically, American women have been the family care-givers.But the nation's labor pool is becoming increasingly female. ALabor Department study by the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolisresearch organization, says women comprise almost half the workforce, compared with 38.1 percent in 1970 and 29.6 percent in 1950.   Other Labor Department figures say 57 percent of all women withchildren under 6 work outside the home, compared with 12 percent in1950. The Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-basedchild-advocacy group, predicts that by 1995, two-thirds of allpreschool children will have working mothers, an increase of 50percent in a decade.   ``Only 7 percent of American households now fit the BeaverCleaver family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,''says a policy paper by the Child Care Action Campaign, a New Yorkcoalition that advocates a national system of care. ``As femalelabor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand forchild care will grow, too.''   Many companies, striving to attract or retain valued employees,offer incentives ranging from flexible work schedules to emergencysitters. Some have gone further, allowing young parents to work athome or take years off with full benefits and job guarantees.Others are building in-house day-care centers, hiring rovingnannies or subsidizing the cost of care with cash.   ``Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to getinto this,'' said Antony Ward, director of Child Care Inc., a NewYork referral service many companies retain to help employees findsitters.   ``A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue,''he said. ``Anyone who takes the kid to the family day-care providerto find a note on the door saying, `I have the flu,' knows whatit's like.''   First Bank System of St. Paul, Minn., for example, this yeardonated space in its office building for a public kindergarten thatdoubles as an after-school day-care center, with priority given tochildren of bank employees. NCNB Corp., a fast-growing bank inCharlotte, N.C., plans to offer many of its workers a child-carereimbursement of up to 50 percent.   Pitney Bowes Inc., a leading maker of business machines inStamford, Conn., helped pioneer flexible working hours toaccommodate working parents, allowing them to arrive early somedays, leave early on others. Federal Express Corp., the Memphis,Tenn., overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-dayweeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts.   Last month, seven large New York-based employers, hoping to cutabsenteeism, announced a pilot program to provide emergency sittersfor workers whose usual arrangements are disrupted.   ``Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly,they're losing employees,'' said Lorraine Dusky, a free-lancewriter and co-author of ``The Best Companies for Women,'' aguidebook to 50 American corporations. ``Companies aren't doingthis to be altruistic. If companies don't do something, we're introuble.''   Child-care activists say, however, that the high-profilebenefits of a few companies mask a potential labor crisis. Mostbusinesses say child care isn't a work-related issue, despiteevidence that help from the boss lowers turnover, raises morale andimproves productivity. Moreover, the activists say, the federalgovernment isn't providing much help.   Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support forchild care is working through Congress, it faces a likely WhiteHouse veto because of the estimated $22.7 billion cost over fiveyears.   President Bush proposes more modest legislation that would cost$2.5 billion a year by 1993, mostly through tax credits to parents.Still, that's less than $20 a week or about $1,000 a year, and itwould go only to poorer families.   Actual costs for out-of-home child care range from $1,500 to$10,000 a year, according to a study by the Conference Board, a NewYork-based business research group. Other studies show much highercosts for in-home care.   Because of the costs and the scarcity of day-care openings, thevast majority of working parents contend with a hodge-podge,hit-or-miss system for finding help they can trust and afford.Stories abound of sitters who ignore, abandon, abuse or kidnapchildren.   Most parents rely on referrals from friends and relatives, butthe result can be hiring an unlicensed, untrained care-giver. Anadditional aggravation is that these care-givers generally takeonly cash to avoid paying income tax. An estimated $7 billion inday-care income goes unreported annually.   Beginning this year, parents must give the Internal RevenueService the name and social security number of their day-careprovider to qualify for a tax credit to defray child-care costs.The IRS plans to cross-reference the returns of sitters andprosecute cheaters.   Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder forparents to afford day care, since many providers will raise ratesto compensate for taxes.   ``Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in thiscountry. One of the ways people are able to survive is to be paidwithout having to declare the income,'' said Barbara Reisman,executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign.   ``I don't recommend people cheat on their taxes,'' she said.``But many parents can't afford to pay the full cost of care.''   Esther J. Kahn, director of Parent's Place, a San Franciscocounseling and referral service, agrees: ``We have a system thathas not caught up with rapid social change in our society, in whichmore women are back in the labor force and need child care. Oursociety hasn't provided support for families.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 15</NOTE></DOC>
