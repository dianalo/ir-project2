In fact, public-health specialists are becoming more and more concerned that the risks -- and costs -- of asbestos removal may outweigh the negligible risks of leaving asbestos materials in place and managing them properly.    The &quot;risk of continued exposure to asbestos&quot; troubles everyone, but the Environmental Protection Agency risk assessment referenced in the article was criticized nearly a decade ago as &quot;essentially speculation&quot; and &quot;scientifically unacceptable&quot; by experts from the Harvard School of Public Health, Oxford University and other institutions. Last year, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded that the average concentration of asbestos fibers in the air inside &quot;the vast majority of buildings with asbestos as surfacing materials&quot; is not significantly different from outdoor air. EPA recently came to a similar conclusion when it monitored the air inside 43 government buildings with asbestos-containing materials.    The logic here is simple. If there is no significant exposure, there is no significant risk and therefore no need to remove asbestos materials. Unfortunately, as the Journal pointed out in an editorial last Oct. 12 on the asbestos-in-schools law, while &quot;EPA does not require removal if the asbestos does not pose a health threat . . . the reasons for this alternative often get lost amid the emotionalism.&quot;    The Aug. 8 article mentions asbestos contractors who don't &quot;do the job right.&quot; School asbestos work has become such a feeding ground for inexperienced consultants and uninsured contractors that the greatest threat posed by asbestos in schools may be its removal. Studies in the U.S. and the U.K. show that higher levels of asbestos are typically found in a building for up to nine months after removal activities have been completed.    Congress passed the asbestos-in-schools law in hopes that it would give schools objective guidance and adequate time to appropriately respond to asbestos. However, the EPA rules implementing the law are creating the very problems Congress sought to avoid: confusion about what to do and what not to do; the use of inadequately trained asbestos inspectors; the proliferation of &quot;rip-and-skip&quot; contractors; and too many panicked, potentially dangerous and costly removal projects.    The lesson to be drawn from the current schools situation is that efforts to protect building occupants from asbestos can be neither misdirected nor mis-paced lest risks be created rather than controlled. However, despite the turbulence from the asbestos-in-schools law, which applies to 107,500 school buildings, some voices are calling for similar legislation for the 3.6 million public and private buildings in the U.S. It does not take much imagination to visualize the situation that would result if every commercial office building, factory, retail establishment, shopping mall, hotel and motel, hospital, nursing home, church and synagogue, as well as every federal, state and local facility, were subject to such legislation.
