It was a remarkable and welcome about-face.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DOCTORS' ABOUT-FACEAGREEMENT ON THE NEED FOR UNIVERSAL MEDICALCOVERAGE WILL AID HEALTH CARE REFORM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Medical costs are growing out of control. Between 30 million and 40 millionuninsured Americans live in fear of medical and financial disaster.;   Doctors are abandoning Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California) in droves, leavingthe poor with nowhere to go but emergency rooms and oversubscribed, publiclyfunded clinics. The trend seems to contradict the AMA's new desire forreform.;    The nation's medical insurance system clearly needs reform.;    Inits latest journal, the AMA condemned the failure to insure all Americans as&quot;no longer acceptable morally, ethically or economically.&quot;;    It also blamed&quot;longstanding, systematic, institutionalized&quot; racism for the fact thatminorities are disproportionately underinsured.;    These wereuncharacteristic and strong words for the AMA, words that should help push theissue to the top of the national agenda where it belongs.;    The solutionswon't be easy. Reform proposals range from requiring all employers to offerminimal health insurance to establishing a tax-based national health systemmodeled after the Canadian, German or Japanese systems.;    Oregon and Hawaiialready have laws that guarantee health insurance for all residents. A bill inthe California Legislature would extend health coverage to uninsured pregnantwomen and children.;    Without a vigorous, public debate, reforming medicalinsurance could be a spotty process that could end up with nearly as muchinequity as there is now.;    The AMA comes to the table in time to providedesperately needed leadership. With vigilance in statehouses and Washington,it could help contain costs and deliver basic medical care at affordableprices to every American.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  310  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136186,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
