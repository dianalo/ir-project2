The British government now is free to end a price-support plan that enabled it to proceed with its #7.24 billion ($12.95 billion) offering of BP shares nearly six weeks ago. But the government seems unwilling to let the shares stand on their own just yet.    The new BP shares have hovered stubbornly near the Bank of England's 70 pence buy-back price since the 2.19 billion-share offering on Oct. 30. The shares traded late yesterday on London's Stock Exchange at 73 pence each. At these levels, the government can't set a date for withdrawing the price-floor offer without risking BP's share price tumbling and thus being forced to buy back many of the shares it recently sold.    The Conservative government &quot;has gotten itself into a box,&quot; says a British merchant banker close to the situation. If the government stops supporting the BP share price now, says Michael Unsworth, an oil analyst at London brokerage Smith New Court, &quot;it will get a lot of BP shares -- which will be politically embarrassing.&quot;    The support plan was hailed as a coup by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who came under great pressure from American underwriters to withdraw the BP offering in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash. On the eve of the offering, Mr. Lawson announced the plan, which called for the Bank of England to buy back any or all of the 2.19 billion shares. The central bank promised to keep its offer in force at least until this Friday but not past Jan. 6, and said it would give five days' warning before ending it.    Mr. Lawson apparently figured the plan would put a floor under BP's price until world financial markets regained some stability. Stability, however, hasn't returned.    The pressure thus has grown on the government to keep the offer open in the hopes that share prices rise. Each day it delays, it avoids confronting the heavy political cost to its free-market policies of having to buy back the shares. The buy-back would tarnish the reputation of its high-profile privatization campaign.    Pressure is growing for alternative solutions. An extension of the buy-back plan beyond Jan. 6 would be politically controversial, and government officials indicate they intend to stick to the deadline.    Another solution, proposed by one British merchant bank to BP, is that BP undertake its own share buy-back plan. Officials close to BP say the oil giant is considering the buy-back plan. Though common in the U.S., it's unusual in Britain and requires a shareholder vote. Despite its purchase of a 14.9% stake in Britoil PLC yesterday, welcomed by analysts as bullish for BP, the company would still be able to fund a share buy-back, analysts say. A BP spokeswoman declined to comment.    The BP new shares, without the government's floor price, have an indicated value of only 55 pence. Given such disparities, the government's decision on when to end the offer depends on its judgment about the short-term outlook for BP's price, and the likelihood that holders will keep their shares even if it's technically against their financial interest.    That judgment, in turn, depends on expectations for higher share prices or oil prices, which itself is linked to such factors as the strength of any year-end rally and the prospect for positive news from the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries beginning today.    Another factor is the number of BP new shares that have found their way to long-term holders who might hold their shares because they expect prices ultimately will rebound. Such holders apparently include the Kuwait Investment Office, which so far has bought at least 31% of the offering. </TEXT></DOC>
