Theresults were compared with those of computed tomography and with theclinical findings. The diagnosis depended on the postoperative histology.Gynaecological examination proved superior to imaging methods in determiningthe extent of local tumour spread. Tumour involvement of the regionallymphatic system was better demonstrated by MRT than by CT. Exact stagingproved inadequate with both these methods and the new imaging methodshave not produced any changes in operative planning or technique.</TEXT></DOC>
