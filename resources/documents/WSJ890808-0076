August delivery gold eased $1.90 an ounce to $365.90. September silver fell four cents an ounce to $5.16. October platinum was down $4.60 an ounce to $484.60.    &quot;The dollar has long been the primary influence on precious metals, and the market has again shown that military and political crises have only a short-lived impact,&quot; said William O'Neill, vice president, research, of Elders Futures Inc., New York.    Mr. O'Neill also noted that oil prices were easier and that the Commodity Research Bureau Index declined. These two anti-inflationary developments hurt precious metals prices, he said.    There has been barely any retail interest in bullion, which has seriously hampered precious metals, he noted. &quot;Normally, we see some anticipatory buying for fall needs,&quot; he said.    Mr. O'Neill suggested that the widening ratio of gold to silver prices might have contributed to selling of silver futures. &quot;The ratio now is about 71.2 in favor of gold,&quot; he said. &quot;Most recently, 50 times has become acceptable, and 60 times is mediocre.&quot;    What appears to be an attitude of more compromise in racial relations in South Africa may be weighing on platinum because it reduces the chance of production problems caused by political upheavals, Mr. O'Neill said.    Also afflicting platinum, he said, is that it's again being treated by traders as more of an industrial metal, reflecting the U.S. industrial slowdown, and as less of a precious metal.    Prices may continue to decline but not significantly more, according to Peter Cardillo, trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York. &quot;August gold isn't too far from its contract low of $360.50, but I don't think it will break below that. Likewise, silver is close to its low of $5.105, but it will hold without breaking through,&quot; he said.    Support will come because while there is widespread concern about a recession, &quot;a soft landing is more likely,&quot; Mr. Cardillo said, and this will inhibit aggressive selling of precious metals.    Not everyone saw the market's performance as wholly negative. Sharon Ziemian, assistant vice president, Citibank N.Y., said gold performed pretty well &quot;considering the heavy pressure of selling induced by the dollar. There was strong support on the buying side, more than I thought there would be.&quot;    There is a good chance that gold will hold in the lower $360 range, she said. &quot;But if it breaks below $360, it is likely to go as low as $350,&quot; she said.    According to Craig Sloane, analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham, New York, the interest-rate market is of significant importance to precious metals.    &quot;Interest rates influence currency markets, which in turn affect precious metals,&quot; he said. &quot;The tone in interest rates has changed dramatically recently. Anticipation of lower interest rates were dashed by Friday's employment report, which came in stronger than expected.&quot;    One effect was that it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates over the near-term, Mr. Sloane said. &quot;That, along with the strong dollar, have contributed to weakness in precious metals,&quot; he said.    Mr. Sloane explained that as interest rates rise, gold prices often drop to attract investors away from rising risk-free returns in Treasury bills.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Crude-oil futures prices drifted lower in light trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Overproduction and sluggish demand lopped 12 cents a barrel off the September price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, pushing it down to $17.91 a barrel. Reports estimated output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as being as high as 21.8 million barrels a day for July. That group, set to meet again next month, had agreed to quotas totaling 19.5 million barrels a day. Demand for crude generally slackens during this time of year as the U.S. summer driving season winds down. Products followed crude lower. Gasoline for September delivery fell 0.49 cent to 49.75 cents a gallon, and September heating oil ended the session at 48.44 cents a gallon, down 7.44 cents.    COPPER: Futures prices fell back from Friday's advances. The September delivery declined 2.25 cents to $1.1055, which was just above the low of the day. One analyst said there is a growing belief that the Highland Valley strike in British Columbia, which began July 9, will be settled by the end of the week. He noted that talks are recessed until the middle of the week, but not because of problems. The mediator was tied up with other work, the analyst said. Selling in London that depressed the cash position there and narrowed its premium over the three-months contract was also a contributing factor in New York's decline, he said. There was technical weakness as well, he said, as the September contract's price fell below $1.11, a key support level, which triggered selling orders that accelerated the decline.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices rose because the monthlong trend of falling prices finally triggered buying by bargain hunters. The correction, which began Friday, follows a drop of about $1.50, or 20%, in the value of some soybean futures contracts. Traders said the soybean rebound was primarily based on technical signals. Fundamental developments for the July price decline, such as the weather, continue to indicate a relatively good-sized harvest. In recent weeks, much of the Midwest has received rainfall. And, despite forecasts for drier weather this week, the soybean and corn crops are expected to benefit from cooler temperatures, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. Corn futures prices rose in part because brokers for South Africa reportedly bought contracts for delivery of roughly 14 million bushels of U.S. corn.    COTTON: Futures prices fell as selling accelerated the decline from recent highs. The December contract ended with a loss of two cents a pound, the maximum daily permitted amount, to 73.96 cents. Other contracts at times touched their limit lows during the session. The action was mostly technical, according to one analyst, who said that the market had been heavily overbought during the recent rise. He noted that from June 7, when the Chinese political situation was most critical and the December price was at 63.40 cents, that futures contracts rose as high as 76.75 cents on July 27, a gain of 13.35 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
