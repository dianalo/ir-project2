Background</ITAG>Section 934 of Pub. L. 96-499, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980,amended Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) to authorize MedicarePart B coverage for facility services furnished in connection with certainsurgical procedures performed in an ambulatory surgical center (ASC). Withrespect to the surgical procedures covered under this provision, section1833 (i)(1) of the Act requires the Secretary to specify, in consultationwith appropriate medical organizations, surgical procedures that, althoughappropriately performed in an inpatient hospital setting, can also be performedsafely on an ambulatory basis. The report accompanying the legislation(Report of the Committee on the Budget to Accompany H.R. 7765, H.R. Rep.No. 96-1167, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 390 (1980)) explained that Congress intendedthat procedures currently performed on an ambulatory basis, especiallyin physicians' offices, that do not generally require the more elaboratefacilities of an ASC, should not be included on the list of covered procedures.In line with this Congressional intent, our current regulations specifythe following four requirements regarding the range of covered services:1. Procedures on the list are to be those commonly performed on an inpatientbasis but which also may be safely performed in an ambulatory surgicalfacility (42 CFR 416.65(a)(1)).2. The list is to exclude procedures that are commonly performed, or thatmay be safely performed, in physicians' offices (andSection; 416.65(a)(2)).3. Procedures are limited to those requiring a dedicated operating roomand generally not requiring an overnight stay (andSection; 416.65(a)(3)).4. The list may not contain procedures excluded from Medicare coverage(andSection; 416.65(a)(4)).The list of covered procedures merely indicates procedures for which paymentmay be made if performed in the ASC. It does not require that these proceduresbe performed in an ASC, nor is any special review or justification requiredif listed procedures are performed on a hospital inpatient basis. The choiceof operating site remains a matter for the professional judgment of thepatient's physician who appropriately may decide that a procedure on thelist may be safety performed only on an inpatient basis.Section 1833(i)(2)(A) of the Act, as amended by section 9343 of the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-509), provides that by July1, 1987, and annually thereafter, the Secretary must review and updateASC payment rates. In addition, section 1833(i)(1) provides that the listof procedures must have been reviewed and updated every 2 years. Sincethe current list of covered procedures was published April 21, 1987, wemust update that list by April 21, 1989.Currently, ASC covered procedures are classified according to a four grouppayment classification system, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="14">Group 1_$274</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Group 2_$326</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Group 3_$351</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Group 4_$399</ITAG>The ASC facility payment for all procedures in each group is at a singlerate adjusted for geographic variation. This prospectively determined facilitygroup rate does not include physicians' fees and other medical items andservices (for example, prosthetic devices, except intraocular lenses) forwhich separate payment is authorized under other provisions of the Medicareprogram. Rather, the rate is a standard overhead amount which covers thecost of services such as nursing, supplies, equipment and use of the facility.As required by section 1833(i) of the Act, we reviewed the ASC paymentrates and proposed revisions to the rates and reimbursement methodologyin the August 18, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 31468).Also, in accordance with section 1833(i) of the Act, the latest updateto the list of covered ASC procedures was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 21, 1987 (52 FR 13176). The update supplementedthe original list of covered ASC procedures published on August 5, 1982(47 FR 34099). Further, on August 11, 1987, we published a proposed notice(52 FR 29729) that announced proposed additions to and deletions from thelist.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Notice </ITAG>In the proposed notice, we announced proposed additions and deletions tothe current list of surgical procedures for which facility services arecovered when the procedures are performed in an ASC. The proposed deletionswere based on analysis of new data that showed that some of the surgicalprocedures on the existing ASC list did not meet the criteria that theybe commonly performed on an inpatient basis in hospitals or not be commonlyperformed in physicians' offices. In the notice, we also solicited publiccomments on additional procedures to be added to the current list of approvedASC procedures and specifically invited comments on extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. We evaluated the usual site of service surgical procedures considered forcoverage under the ASC benefit based on the Part B Medicare Data files(BMAD), which are maintained centrally as a component of the Medicare statisticalsystem. One of the BMAD files is the procedure file, from which sourcedata are extracted to create an array of every procedure code used by eachcarrier in processing Medicare claims. The procedure file includes suchdata elements as frequency, submitted charges, allowed charges, and deniedservices. These variables can be arrayed for each procedure code by siteof service (for example, physician's office, ASC, inpatient hospital, outpatienthospital) and by type of service (for example, surgical service). The procedure file is constructed from 100 percent of the bills processedannually by carriers reporting procedures using the HCFA Common ProcedureCoding System (HCPCS). The source data that we used in assessing site ofservice were claims processed in calendar year 1984. The 1984 file excludedclaims processed by carriers servicing Texas, Utah, Michigan, Georgia,and New Jersey because in that year those carriers did not report usingHCPCS codes. When we arrayed currently covered ASC services by site of service, we foundthat many of them were not commonly furnished on an inpatient basis orwere furnished in physicians' offices a majority of the time. Based onthese data, it would be contrary to our regulations and program objectivesto continue to cover them when performed in an ASC. We decided that ifa procedure is performed on an inpatient basis 20 percent of the time orless, or in physicians' offices 50 percent of the time or more, it shouldnot be covered in an ASC. Subsequently, we identified 70 procedure codesthat we proposed to delete. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Discussion of Public Comments on the Proposed Notice </ITAG>We received 927 pieces of timely correspondence, most of which expressedopposition to the deletion of one or more of the procedures from the list.Many of the general comments expressed support for ASCs. Approximately 400 comments were deleted from urologists and their patients,all opposed to the deletion of CPT code 52000, cystourethroscopy. The nextlargest group writing in opposition to the deletions were practicing podiatristsand podiatric medical students, the latter sending a signed petition. Theremaining comments were spread among plastic surgeons, orthopedic surgeons,ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, thoracic surgeons, hand surgeons,obstetricians/gynecologists, pathologists, and dentists. In addition, ASCs,hospitals and a lithotripsy center submitted comments. The commenters' objections to many of our proposed deletions were supportedby our subsequent analysis of Medicare claims data processed in calendaryear 1986. As a result of the analysis of this more recent complete billingdata, we are retaining 22 of the 70 CPT-4 codes originally proposed fordeletion. A summary of the comments, and our responses to them, follow:A. Impact on Rural Areas<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the proposalwould adversely affect rural health care because (1) elderly patients wouldbe required to travel long distances to receive services that would nolonger be available locally; (2) rural hospitals would lose income whichwould affect their ability to provide comprehensive care; and (3) the availabilityof health care in rural areas would be decreased if facilities for theseprocedures were unavailable. Also, it was suggested that the increasedcost of providing the services in an urban area would negate any advantagegained.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe the commenters overestimate the impact ofthe proposed deletions on ASCs and, to some extent, misunderstand the effectof deleting the procedures. First, the deletion of 48 procedures, mostlyof the integumentary system, will not have a significant financial impacton an individual ASC. This is a small number of procedures to be deleted,especially in light of the approximate 1300 procedures that were addedto the list of covered ASC procedures on April 21, 1987 (52 FR 13176).Second, since the deletion of a given procedure from HCFA's list does notmean that it may no longer be performed in an ASC (although the ASC wouldreceive no facility fee for the procedure's performance) or in a hospitaloutpatient department, it is incorrect to assume that elderly patientswill need to travel to urban areas to receive care.B. Impact on Hospitals<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that if a procedurewas deleted from the ASC list, then no reimbursement would be made forthe procedure in the hospital outpatient department since the outpatientdepartment is paid for ASC listed procedures using ASC reimbursement guidelines.Others believed that rural hospitals would be forced to create a separateand distinct ASC in order to be reimbursed.<T3>Response: </T3>As noted in our response to comments on the impact ofour proposal on rural areas, we believe that the commenters misunderstandthe effect of deleting a procedure from the list. The deletion of a proceduresimply means that an ASC will no longer receive a facility fee for theperformance of that procedure. It does not mean that hospitals will notbe paid for performing the procedure in their outpatient departments. Paymentfor the performance of deleted procedures will be made to hospital outpatientdepartments on a reasonable cost basis. Hospitals do not need to builddistinct and separate ASCs in order to be paid for performing procedureson the list.C. Impact on Physicians' Offices<T3>Comment: </T3>Some physicians expressed concern that the performanceof several of the procedures proposed for deletion would be inappropriateif performed in an office setting because office surgical facilities aretotally unregulated.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe that the commenters are expressing concernthat procedures performed in physicians' offices are not subject to thesame quality of care and medical necessity reviews as are procedures performedin hospitals and ASCs. While that is true, we note that the deletion ofa procedure from the ASC list does not mean it must be performed in a physician'soffice. We expect physicians to select the appropriate setting for theperformance of any procedure, taking into account the circumstances ofa particular patient.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several physicians expressed concern that the performanceof a procedure under general or spinal anesthesia in the office would requireextensive equipping and additional special staff and that monitored anesthesiawould be an additional liability.<T3>Response: </T3>As noted above, we are not mandating that these proceduresbe performed in the office setting. Further, we are not precluding theirperformance in an ASC. The deletion of a procedure from the list simplymeans that the ASC will not be paid a facility fee for the performanceof the procedure. The physician would continue to be paid on a reasonablecharge basis regardless of the setting in which the procedure was performed(office, ASC, or hospital).<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters noted that there is no additionalfacility fee paid to a physician's office and that the cost incurred forthe performance of a procedure deleted from the ASC list would be bornedirectly by the physician and would result in a substantial loss each timea Medicare patient is treated. Commenters alleged that if the proposeddeletions occurred, physicians would incur expenditures to (1) remodeland redesign areas in their offices; (2) maintain emergency supplies andequipment; (3) hire trained personnel; and (4) purchase sterile equipmentand supplies. It was argued that this would lead to an unnecessary duplicationof services already available at ASCs.<T3>Response: </T3>First, as noted above, HCFA does not mandate that anysurgery be performed in the office. Second, our billing data indicate thatmost of the procedures we are deleting from the list are routinely performedin physicians' offices. Although there are undoubtedly additional costsassociated with the performance of these procedures in the office, we donot believe that they result in substantial losses given the extent towhich physicians already perform them without additional payments overand above their professional fees.D. Threshold Rule <T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters objected to our decision to delete fromthe ASC list any procedure that is performed on an inpatient basis 20 percentof the time or less or in physicians' offices 50 percent of the time ormore. It was argued that the threshold rule is arbitrary and that its applicationwould reduce the cost savings associated with ASCs. <T3>Response: </T3>We acknowledge that the threshold levels are, to someextent, judgmental and that other levels (higher or lower) could have beenselected. We decided that the fairest and least arguable level for ``commonlyperformed in physicians' offices'' would be 50 percent or higher. We rejectedthe application of a 50 percent level for ``commonly performed on an inpatientbasis'' because that level would have led to a much greater number of deletionsand because we recognized that in the past few years, more and more proceduresthat had been done on an inpatient basis are now being done on an outpatientbasis. We recognize that the deletion of procedures from the list willhave some effect on ASCs. However, to be consistent with Congressionalintent and our regulations, we are obliged to assure that the list excludesprocedures that are commonly performed in physicians' offices or not commonlyperformed on an inpatient basis. We note that the threshold levels are intended to be general guidelinesrather than absolute cut-off points. In some situations, we have made exceptionsand not deleted procedures that would have been deleted by a strict applicationof the threshold rule. Such exceptions have been made in cases where thehigh level of ASC utilization has itself depressed the inpatient rate belowthe 20 percent level. In addition, some procedures have remained on theapproved list in order to maintain a clinically consistent approach. Insome other cases, with borderline data, we accepted the comments of thosearguing that quality of care could be threatened if the procedures weredeleted from the ASC approved list. E. Billing Data_(Deletions) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters questioned the validity of the BMADfile noting that the ``place of service'' indicator on a billing form maynot be correctly completed since it does not affect payment. Others questionedthe appropriateness of analyzing 1984 data that did not include informationfrom all carriers. <T3>Response: </T3>We acknowledge that the place of service indicator inthe 1984 BMAD file was not validated. However, it was the best availableinformation at the time the proposed notice was published and, to a largeextent, contained information provided by physicians or their staff. Therefore,we are reasonably confident that it contained accurate information. Sincethe publication of the proposed notice, more recent and complete informationhas become available. We analyzed the 1985 and 1986 BMAD files which includeinformation from all the carriers, and found that several of the proceduresthat we had proposed for deletion were not performed as frequently in physicians'offices as the 1984 BMAD file data suggested. Where these more currentdata were consistent with the comments we received, we retained the procedureson the list. We provide an analysis of the data and our response to commentsfor each of the proposed deletions in the following sections. We did notreceive specific comments on every individual procedure code. However,since many of the commenters objected, in general, to the deletion of anyprocedures, we will provide the basis of our final decision for each ofthe individual procedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Integumentary System</ITAG>a. <T3>Excision of skin tags (procedure codes 11200 and 11201):</T3> No specificcomments were received on these procedures. BMAD data for 1986 indicatethat these procedures are performed over 90 percent of the time in physicians'office. Therefore, they are deleted.b. <T3>Excision of benign lesions (procedure codes 11401, 11402, 11403, 11404,11421, 11422, 11423, 11441, 11442, 11443, and 11444): </T3>Several commentersobjected to the proposed deletion of excisions of lesions of greater than2.0 cm diameter. In particular, concern was expressed over the removalof larger lesions of the face and genitalia in an office setting. MVADdata for 1986 indicate that all of the proposed deletions are performedless than 5 percent of the time on an inpatient basis and more than 60percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore, they are deleted.It is possible that the commenters' views that larger lesions of the genitaliaand face should not be removed in an office setting would be supportedif the data were based on more precise CPT-4 codes. For instance, procedurecode 11444 includes lesions of the eyelids, ears, nose, lips and mucusmembranes in addition to the face. At the present time, we have no meansof distinguishing the specific site of the lesions that are excised. Wewill explore other methods to distinguish these procedures (for example,link narrative diagnosis and procedure codes). In the interim, however,the procedures will be deleted from the list based on BMAD data for 1986.c. <T3>Excision of malignant lesions (procedure codes 11600, 11601, 11602,11603, 11604, 11620, 11621, 11622, 11623, 11624, 11640, 11641, 11642, 11643,and 11644):</T3> The most frequently received comments were from urologistswho expressed opposition to the deletion of excisions of malignant lesionsof the scalp, neck, hands, feet and genitalia (procedure codes 11620 through11624) because of their concern that malignant lesions of the male genitaliacannot be easily or safety performed in an office setting. Other commentersfelt that skin lesions of any size that might be malignant should remainon the list because a frozen section diagnosis might be required. BMADdata for 1986 indicate that malignant lesions are excised more frequentlyon an inpatient basis than are benign lesions. All of the proposed deletionsare performed 55-85 percent of the time in physicians' offices. As withbenign lesions, we note the difficulty in distinguishing the location oflesions through the procedure codes that combine several locations in asingle code. We will explore other methods of distinguishing the preciselocation of the lesions. In the interim, however, the procedures will bedeleted from the list based on BMAD data for 1986. We note again that thedeletion of these procedures from the ASC list does not mean that theymust be performed in an office setting. If a physician believes that hisoffice is not adequately equipped or staffed to perform a given proceduresafely, the physician should arrange to perform the procedure in a settingappropriate to the patient's needs.d. <T3>Excision of nail and nail matrix, partial or complete, for permanentremoval (procedure code 11750): </T3>No specific comments were receivedon this procedure. BMAD data for 1986 indicate that it is performed over80 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore, it is deleted.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Musculoskeletal System </ITAG>a. <T3>Treatment of closed or open nasal fracture without manipulation (procedurecode 21310); </T3>No specific comments were received on this procedure.BMAD data for 1986 indicate that although it is performed 16 percent ofthe time on an inpatient basis, it is performed less than 50 percent ofthe time in physicians' offices. Therefore, it will not be deleted fromthe list. b. <T3>Tenotomy, hand or finger (procedure codes 26060 and 26460): </T3>Nospecific comments were received. BMAD data for 1986 indicate that theseprocedures are perfomed more than 20 percent of the time on an inpatientbasis and less than 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore,they will not be deleted from the list. c. <T3>Tenotomy procedures, foot or toe (procedure codes 28010, 28011, 28230,28232, 28234, and 28240): </T3>For these and the other foot and toe proceduresdiscussed below, many comments were received expressing concern that deletingthe procedures would adversely affect quality of care. In particular, podiatristswere concerned that the deletion of a procedure from the list would forcepodiatrists to attempt the procedure in their offices where the appropriatestaff and equipment might not be available. Commenters stated that ASCswould not permit podiatrists to use their facilities if a facility paymentwas not available and that many podiatrists do not have the option of usinghospital outpatient departments since surgical privileges are not availableto podiatrists in many parts of the country. Several orthopedic surgeonsalso objected to the deletion of the procedures but for different reasons.They claimed that the data were skewed by the podiatrists who frequentlyperform the procedures in their offices. They also indicated that for reasonsof quality this was inappropriate and that the procedures can be performedsafely only in an ASC or hospital. We acknowledge that podiatrists in someareas of the country may be unable to obtain surgical privileges at theirlocal hospital, although we believe that this problem is diminishing withtime. In response to the concern that the podiatrists are skewing the data,we performed a special analysis that confirmed that podiatrists performin their offices the foot and toe procedures proposed for deletion morefrequently than other practitioners. However, we have no evidence thatthe quality of care provided in an office setting (by podiatrists or someorthopedic surgeons) is less than that provided in an ASC or hospital outpatientdepartment. Also, BMAD data for 1986 indicate that all the tenotomies proposedfor deletion are performed in an office setting between 54-77 percent ofthe time. Therefore, they are deleted. d. <T3>Osteotomy procedures (procedure codes 26567, 28306, 28308, 28310, and28312): </T3>The comments received on the proposed deletion of osteotomyprocedures were comparable to those received on tenotomies. Unlike tenotomies,however, the more recent BMAD data for 1986 indicate that, with the exceptionof an osteotomy of the proximal phalanx of the first toe (procedure code28310) and osteotomy of other phalanges, any toe (procedure code 28312),all the osteotomy procedures proposed for deletion are performed more than20 percent of the time on an inpatient basis and less than 50 percent ofthe time in physicians' offices. Data on procedure codes 28310 and 28312indicate that they are performed 18 and 25 percent of the time on an inpatientbasis and 54 and 51 percent of the time in physicians' offices, respectively.In light of the comments received, the more recent data, and for the sakeof clinical consistency, all of the osteotomy procedures that had beenproposed for deletion will be retained on the list.   e. <T3>Fasciotomy, plantar and/or toe, subcutaneous (procedure code 282008):</T3>No specific comments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986indicate that it is performed more than 20 percent of the time on an inpatientbasis and less than 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore,it will not be deleted from the list.f. <T3>Repair of suture of tendon, foot, flexor. single (procedure code 28200):</T3>No specific comments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986indicate that it is performed more than 20 percent of the time on an inpatientbasis and less than 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore,it will not be deleted from the list.g. <T3>Capsulotomy, midtarsal (Heyman type procedure) (procedure code 28264):</T3>No specific comments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for1985 indicate that it is performed more than 20 percent of the time onan inpatient basis and less than 50 percent of the time in physicians'offices. Therefore, it will not be deleted from the list.h. <T3>Capsulotomy for contracture, metatarsophalangeal joint (procedure code28270) and interphalangeal joint (procedure code 28272):</T3> No specificcomments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986 indicate thatthese procedures are performed over 70 percent of the time in physicians'offices. Therefore, they are deleted.i. <T3>Hammertoe procedures (procedure code 28285 and 28286):</T3> No specificcomments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986 indicate thatthese procedures are performed more than 20 percent of the time on an inpatientbasis and less than 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore,they will not be deleted from the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Respiratory System</ITAG>a. <T3>Repair nasal septal perforations (procedure code 30630):</T3> Severalcommenters objected to the deletion of this procedure which, in their opinion,should not be performed in an office setting. BMAD data for 1986 supportthe comments, indicating that this procedure is performed more than 20percent of the time on an inpatient basis and less than 50 percent of thetime in physicians' offices. Therefore, it will not be deleted from thelist.b. <T3>Laryngoscopy procedures (procedure code 31505, 31510, and 31525):</T3>Several commenters objected to the deletion of these procedures, whichin their opinion, are rarely performed as office procedures and are invariablydone in a surgical setting. BMAD data for 1986 indicate that laryngoscopy,indirect; with biopsy (procedure code 31510) is commonly performed on aninpatient basis and not commonly performed in physician's offices. Therefore,(procedure code 31510) will not be deleted from the list. BMAD data for1986 indicate that direct laryngoscopies, diagnostic (procedure code 31525)are performed 53 percent of the time in physicians' offices. However, inlight of the comments received and in view of the fact that comparableprocedures (for example, procedure codes 31526 and 31527) will not be deletedfrom the list, procedure code 31525 will not be deleted. Because the dataindicate that indirect diagnostic laryngoscopies (procedure code 31505)are performed more than 79 percent of the time in physicians' offices,procedure code 31505 will be deleted from the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Digestive System</ITAG>a. <T3>Biopsy of Tongue (procedure code 41100):</T3> No specific commentswere received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986 indicate that it isperformed less than 20 percent of the time on an inpatient basis and lessthan 66 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore, it willbe deleted from the list.b. <T3>Dialation of rectal stricture under anesthesia other than local (procedurecode 45910)</T3> Several commenters objected to the deletion of this procedurenoting that anesthesia is required and that physicians' ofices are notequipped to provide this service. BMAD data for 1986 support the comments,indicating that this procedure is performed more than 20 percent of thetime on an inpatient basis and less than 50 percent of the time in physicians'offices. Therefore, it will not be deleted from the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Urinary System</ITAG>a. <T3>Cystourethroscopy (procedure code 52000):</T3> Objections to the proposeddeletion of this procedure were received from more than 400 commenterswho indicated that the procedure is inappropriate (particularly for malepatients) for the office setting. Specifically cited reasons for oppositionwere (1) quality of care could not be assured in an office setting; (2)anesthesia is frequently required and should not be administered in a physician'soffice; and (3) greater expense to the Medicare program as a result ofa shift from the ASCs to hospital outpatient departments. BMAD data for1986 indicate that cystourethroscopy is performed more than 20 percentof the time on an inpatient basis. Although it is performed 52 percentof the time in physicians' offices, in light of the comments received,it will not be deleted from the list.b. <T3>Urethral dilation procedures (procedure codes 53600, 53601, 53620,53621, 53660, 53661, and 53665):</T3> Many commenters objected to the deletionof these procedures claiming that our proposal was arbitrary, capricious,and inconsistent with the practice of quality medicine. Several commentersnoted that the performance of procedure code 53665 required general orspinal anesthesia that would be inappropriate in an office setting. Weaccept that comment since it is supported by the BMAD data for 1986 andwill retain procedure code 53665 on the list. However, we have not acceptedthe other comments since the BMAD data for 1986 indicate that between 69percent and 98 percent of the other procedures are performed in physicians'offices. Therefore, procedure codes 53600, 53601, 53620, 53621, 53660 and53661 are deleted from the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Female Genital System</ITAG><T3>Dilation of vagina under anesthesia (procedure code 57400):</T3> Severalcommenters objected to the deletion of this procedure noting that anesthesiais required and that physicians' offices are not equipped to provide thisservice. BMAD data for 1986 support the comments indicating that this procedureis performed more than 20 percent of the time on an inpatient basis andless than 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Therefore, itwill not be deleted from the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Eye and Ocular Adnexa</ITAG>a. <T3>Discussion of lens capsule (procedure code 66800):</T3> No specificcomments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986 indicate thatit is performed less than 20 percent of the time on an inpatient basisand less than 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. However, althoughit is not commonly performed on an inpatient basis, the data indicate thatit is performed 30 percent of the time in an ASC. Therefore, it will notbe deleted from the list.b. <T3>Excision of chalazion (procedure code 67801):</T3> One commenter objectedto the deletion of this procedure and noted that the occurrence of a multiplelesions in an infant or child would require general anesthesia that couldnot be provided in a physician's office. BMAD data for 1986 indicate thatthis procedure is preformed 87 percent of the time in physicians' offices.Therefore, it will be deleted from the list. We note that the proper procedurecode for the case described by the commenter is not procedure code 67801,but procedure code 67808 (excision of chalazion under general anesthesiaand/or requiring hospitalization, single or multiple). This procedure code(67808) is on the list of covered ASC procedures.c. <T3>Plastic repair of canaliculi (procedure code 68700):</T3> No specificcomments were received on this procedure. BMAD data for 1986 indicate thatit is performed less than 20 percent of the time on an inpatient basisand approximately 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices. Althoughit is not commonly performed on an inpatient basis, the data indicate thatit is performed 10 percent of the time in an ASC. Therefore, it will notbe deleted from the list.d. <T3>Probing of nasolacrimal duct with insertion of tube or stent (procedurecode 68830):</T3> No specific comments were received on this procedure.BMAD data for 1986 indicate that it is performed 7 percent of the timeon an inpatient basis and 68 percent of the time in physicians' offices.Therefore, it will be deleted from the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Auditory System</ITAG><T3>Myringotomy including aspiration and/or eustachian tube inflation (procedurecode 69420):</T3> Two commenters objected to the proposed deletion becauseit would then be performed as an inpatient procedure where costs wouldbe higher. They noted that the procedure is not properly done in a physician'soffice, since a biopsy of the nasopharynx should be done before placinga tube in the ear of an elderly patient. It was argued that unilateralhearing loss in an elderly patient should be considered an indication ofmalignancy until proven otherwise. Another commenter noted that two differentprocedures are included under procedure code 69420 (Myringotomy and/oreustachian tube inflation) and that the former is an operating room procedureand the latter an office procedure. We believe that procedure 69420 isbeing performed for other indications in addition to that of hearing losssince the BMAD data for 1986 indicate that more than 84 percent are performedin physicians' offices. Also, as we noted in our response under the integumentarysystem, we are unable to distinguish between two procedures that are includedin the description of a single CPT-4 code. In view of the high physicianoffice frequency, this procedure will be deleted from the list.F. AdditionsIn addition to the list of proposed deletions that was included in ourproposed notice, we specifically requested comments on additions to theASC list. In particular, we sought comments on the addition of extracorporealshock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) because we had received several requestsfor the addition of this procedure after the close of the comment periodfor our proposed notice published on February 16, 1984 (49 FR 6023) onwhich we based our April 21, 1987 (52 FR 13176) expansion of the list ofcovered procedures.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters were divided in their recommendations forESWL (procedure code 50590). Many of those in favor of adding the procedureto the list did not provide a specific rationale for their recommendation.On the other hand, those opposed, while fewer in number, provided specificobjections to adding the procedure to the list. A State urological associationindicated that the procedure carries with it the dangers of hemorrhageand infection and that it should be considered an inpatient procedure.Another commenter indicated that the procedure should be done on an inpatientbasis and an overnight stay required because of the possibility of complicationsand the need of close monitoring. Another indicated that ESWL was appropriatefor outpatient use in younger patients with small stones.<T3>Response:</T3> We agree with the commenters who believe that the outpatientutilization of ESWL (procedure code 50590) is only safe with a carefullyselected patient population, and that it will continue to be an inpatientprocedure for the majority of Medicare patients. In view of the concernsover safety that were raised by several commenters and in considering ourdata, which indicate that ESWL is still most often an inpatient procedure,we have decided not to add it to the list at this time. As more informationand data on the safety of ESWL become available, we will continue to evaluatethe appropriateness of adding this procedure to the ASC list. In additionto our concerns about safety based on the comments received, we are notyet convinced that ESWL can be categorized as a ``surgical'' procedure.We note that this decision does not mean that ESWL can be covered onlywhen performed on an inpatient basis. For certain patients, ESWL can beperformed safely on an outpatient basis. The choice of site remains a matterfor the professional judgment of the patient's physician.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Dental Procedures</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that dental cases requiring generalanesthesia should be added to the list.<T3>Response:</T3> Section 1862(a)(12) of the Act excludes from coverageany services in connection with the care, treatment, filling, removal,or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting the teeth. TheASC regulations at andSection;416.65 prohibit the inclusion of noncoveredservices on the list of covered services. Therefore, dental cases requiringgeneral anesthesia cannot be added to the list.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Laser Procedures</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters recommended adding procedures to the listthat required the use of a surgical laser and specifically recommendedthe addition of retinal detachment repair (procedure code 67105) and prophylaxisof retinal detachment (procedure code 67145).<T3>Response:</T3> A laser may be used for any surgical procedure on theASC list provided that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approvedthe use of the laser for that particular procedure. With a few exceptions,the procedures contained in CPT-4 do not specify the use of a laser. Procedurecodes 67105 and 67145 are two of those exceptions. We reviewed BMAD datafor 1986 that indicate that procedure code 67105 (retinal detachment repair)is performed more than 20 percent of the time on an inpatient basis andless than 50 percent of the time in physician offices. Therefore, it willbe added to the list. On the other hand, procedure code 67145 (prophylaxisof retinal detachment) is performed less than 10 percent of the time onan inpatient basis and over 50 percent of the time in physician's offices.Therefore, it will not be added to the list.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Arthroscopy</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended adding procedure codes 23356,23357, and 23358 to the list.<T3>Response:</T3> These three codes describe arthroscopic procedures ofthe shoulder. They were deleted from the CPT-4 in 1986 and replaced byprocedure codes 29815 through 29825. Because there is not a one-to-onecorrelation with the new codes and we will not have a full year of datato review until BMAD data for 1987 are available, we will not add theseprocedures at this time. They will be considered when the list is nextupdated.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Provisions of the Final Notice</ITAG>This notice is being issued to finalize the list of proposed additionsand deletions that we published on August 11, 1987. Additionally, thisnotice fulfills the requirements of section 1833(i)(1)(A) of the Act thatthe list of ASC procedures be reviewed and updated no less than every 2years.A.

Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any final notice that will produce effectsmeeting one of the E.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that willbe likely to result in_ andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This final notice does not meet the $100 million criterion nor do we believethat it meets the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this final noticeis not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and a final regulatory impact analysisis not required. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a final notice will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, all physicians, ASCs and hospitals are treated as small entities.Although some commenters believed that the deletion of some proceduresfrom the list of approved ASC procedures would have an adverse effect onsome ASCs and hospitals, we pointed out in our responses to these commentersthat dropping the procedures does not remove coverage for these procedures.It means only that we will not pay the facility amount that had been associatedwith the procedure (that is, the facility payment amount for one of thefour payment groups into which the procedure had been classified. Furthermore, in almost all instances of a procedure being deleted fromthe list of approved ASC procedures, fewer than one percent of the procedureswere being performed in an ASC. The majority of cases involving deletedprocedures were being treated in a physician's office. Thus, the effectof deleting the procedures listed in this document is expected to haveonly a slight economic effect on ASCs. Although the effect of deleting the procedures listed in this notice isexpected to be small, there may be a slight benefit to hospital outpatientdepartments. Approved ASC procedures performed in a hospital outpatientsetting are subject to a payment limitation of the lower of the hospital'scost or charges, or a blend of the applicable ASC facility payment amountand the lower of the hospital's costs or charges. For procedures removedfrom the list of approved ASC procedures, the hospital will be subjectonly to the lower of costs or charges. In most cases, hospital outpatientcosts or charges are higher than the applicable ASC facility payment amount.The benefit to hospitals, however, is expected to be very small. First,the difference between the payment amount hospitals receive under the blendof 50 percent of the hospital's facility costs and 50 percent of the standardASC facility amount that is in effect now and the amounts they will bepaid is negligible for the procedures being deleted. Second, since mostof the procedures being deleted are already performed either in a hospitaloutpatient setting or in a physician's office, we do not expect a significanttransfer of cases and payments from ASCs to hospital outpatient settingsto occur. For these reasons, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, thatthis notice will not have a significant effect on a substantial numberof small entities. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibilityanalysis. Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a final notice may have a significant impact on theoperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysismust conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposesof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospitalwith fewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.We received some comments expressing concern about the effect on ruralhospitals of deleting some procedures from the list of approved ASC procedures.However, as explained in our response to these comments and in the precedingdiscussion, we do not expect a significant effect on any small entitiesto follow from this notice. Therefore, we are not preparing a rural impactstatement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies that thisfinal notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operationsof a substantial number of small rural hospitals. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
