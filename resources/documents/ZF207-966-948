 The two main types ofnetworks are centralized networks, which dedicate a 'file server'to network-related processing, and distributed networks, in whicheach machine does some of the network processing tasks.andO;Distributed networks are less expensive and support fewer usersthan centralized systems.andP;  File servers may be connected toworkstations via twisted-pair telephone wiring or with the TokenRing or Ethernet protocols.andP;  Each machine requires an add-innetwork adapter board.andP;  Network software consists of a networkoperating system and a small driver program based on either aproprietary or NetBIOS standard.andP;

 The reason is simply -- Until recently,communications between computers was left to electronics engineers, with asmattering of programmers at each end.andP;  This was fine, but electronicsengineers label every innovation with a descriptive title, hence the long,but generally meaningful, acronyms.andP;  To help even the most techno-phobic,I've split the field of networking into easily palatable divisions: adefinition of what makes a netowkr, the software and hardware that drives it,and what can you do with it once it's in.andM;What is a network?andP;  All the hardware and software paraphernalia in the worldcannot disguise the fact that the prime purpose of a network is to allow onecomputer to exchange data with another.andP;  However, the reason why the data ishurtling backwards and forwards is the point at which things start to getcomplicated.andM;There are really just two types of network.andP;  The first dedicates a singlemachine to do all the network-related processing, the fileserver: this iscalled a centralized network.andP;  The second type lets each machine on thenetwork do some of the chores: this is a distributed network.andM;Typically, the cheapest PC networks around are distributed networks; thehigh-priced PC flavorous, such as Novell NetWare and 3Com 3+ Open, arecentralized, while mini and mainframe networks are again distributed.andM;Each has its own benefits.andP;  The centralized network only requires onehigh-powered PC and all data is in one easy-to-reach location.andP;  Having adistributed network means that most of the computers within it must beintelligent, but if one fails, the system will carry on.andM;The centralized system requires a server, which needs to be no more than abox containing a hard disk.andP;  Some RAM and a fast processor.andP;  Nor keyboard orscreen is required, although PC-based servers usually have these by default.andM;Computers connected to the network (other than the fileserver) are calledclients, workstations or just stations, and they could be just dumb terminals(with no processing capabilities) or normal PCs running special software.andP;  Tobe useful, the workstations need both a screen and keyboard.andP;  The only otherdevice you're likely to need is a printer, which is connected to the serverin a centralized network or to the workstation that's been given the task oflooking after printing in a distributed system.andM;The hardwareandM;Connecting the server to the workstations (or connecting the workstationstogether within a distributed network) is the next step.andP;  There are many waysof doing this, but the three most common in the PC world are Twisted Pair,Ethernet and Token Ring.andM;These names refer to the technology that's used to send the data - nothingelse.andP;  To use any of these three methods, an add-in driver board, packed withsuitable electronics, is plugged into each computer within the network --including the server -- and wired together.andM;Why bother with special add-in boards?andP;  Why not just cannect the main busesof each computer together with a piece of wire?andP;  Oh, if only it were thatsimple.andP;  The various technologies have evoled because the humble digitalsignal within a PC is a mere 5V high and, if left to roam along a cable morethan a few feet away from the casing, will get saud kicked in its face bynoise and the cable's electrical resistance.andP;  It would also require anabsolute minimum of 12 wires running between each PC -- and wires isexpensive.andM;On the subject of wire (which, in Comms Speak, is called cabling), how do youconnect the boards within each PC together?andP;  Twisted pair cable comprises twothin wires lightly twisted to reduce the noise and load produced.andP;  It'snormally terminated with a standard 9-pin connector (like a serial port).andO;Each board will have two connectors: one in, one out.andP;  For a three-stationnetwork, you would wire station A to B and B to C.andP;  A and C would have an'in' and an 'out' connector free, which would either be terminated with aspecial plug or wired to each other to form a ring, depending on themanufacturer.andM;Ethernet cable is coaxial; like TV aerial cable, it has a central copper coresurrounded by an insulator, then a shield.andP;  This is terminated by BNC plugs,again similar to those on a TV.andP;  Each board has one BNC socket and aT-connector: you wire station A to C with an outlet for B via theT-connector.andM;Token Ring uses thicker cable with a minimum of two wires to carry thesignal.andP;  The point about a Token Ring network is that it is a ring.andP;  Theboard has a 9-pin D-connector; the cable runs from this to a box called aMedium Access Unit (or Multi Station Access Until in IBM Speak).andP;  This, formost small applications, is the ring.andP;  It accepts between eight and 16computers and ensures, even if they are not switched on, that the ring isalways completed.andM;Whatever you do, don't leave cabling out of your price calculations justbecause it's a bit of wire.andP;  Cabling costs have the unfortunate habit ofbecoming very, very large.andP;  The gents that rush around fitting the cablinginto your office are some of the most highly paid around.andP;  For a smalleight-user network, getting someone in to install the cabling can costseveral hundred pounds.andM;The add-in boards convert the data into a serial form and bundle around itinformation to ensure it gets to the right place, saying where it's from andmaking sure that any errors that occur in transmission are corrected.andP;  Thetechnology used to convert and send data from the PC along the wire isgrouped together under the title of low-level protocol.andP;  (There areexceptions, but let's keep things simple.)andP;  The reason it's termed low-levelis because the user does not control it - software does.andM;The softwareandM;Network software is made up of two parts: one does the useful things likelook after passwords, printers, file transfers, mail and so on -- this is thenetwork operating system.andP;  The important thing to realize about the operatingsystem is that it expects to be able to communicate with other PCs on thenetwork in a certain, fixed way -- no matter whether it's an Ethernet orToken Ring card sending the signals.andM;To solve this problem, you are requested to select the type (and make) ofhardware card in use when installing the network software.andM;Part two is a small driver program that is used to provide a standard look tothe differing hardware cards.andP;  It's the small driver program that differs foreach setup, not the operating system or hardware.andM;The driver program takes two forms.andP;  The first, fastest and most efficient isa specially written driver provided with the operating system software forthe particular variety of hardware card you've installed.andP;  This talksdirectly to that one manufacturerhs card, but to no other.andP;  Most networksoftware is ready to interact with a wide range hardware decices.andM;The second method is to use a shtandard called NetBios.andP;  This is supplied bythe hardware manufacturer and provides a standard programming interface.andP;  Theoperating system then deals with the hardware via the NetBIOS layer.andP;  This isslower but standardized.andP;  Almost all hardware cards and network operatingsystems support NetBIOS, so, in theory, anything can run with anything else.andM;Most general-purpose applications such as work processors and databasesmanage to run on a range of networks by using the NetBIOS interface to talkto the network.andP;  Your hardware should be able to support NetBIOS; if itdoesn't, or your software cannot emulate it, then it's a definite minuspoint.andM;What now?andP;  Once the hardware boards are in, the software drivers selected,the network operating system installed on the server and the whole lot cabledtogether, what's the result?andP;  Well, if it all works--which is unlikely firsttime for your first network - you can start configuring the system.andM;All or part of this will have been done during the main installation, butthere are three basic tasks left: one, install the owrkstation software; two,set up the user accounts; and three, set the drive mappings.andM;Taking these in order, the workstation software is resident all the time oneach workstation and just looks after such tasks as translating screencommands from your word processor, searching remote disk drives and the like.andO;It's simple but takes some precious workstation RAM and has to be installed.andM;User accounts consist of a record containing information about when the userwas last on, his rights to look at various files, which printer he can use,and so on.andP;  All of this information is identified by a user name andpassword.andP;  With the aid of an audit trail, you can see who has been doingwhat, when and for how long.andM;Dirve mappings are one of the most important tasks, and sometimes the mostbothersome.andP;  I'll assume you are using a PC as a workstation and that this PChas a floppy and a hard disk.andP;  Usually, the floppy is drive A and the harddisk C.andP;  One benefit of a network is that you can access disk drives (orresources) on another machine as if they were your own.andM;The problem is that DOS needs a drive letter.andP;  This is where the LASTDRIVEcommand comes in.andP;  Placed in the CONFIG.SYS file, it describes how manydrives DOS can access.andP;  So if I had the line 'LASTDRIVE=H:' in my CONFIG.SYSfile, I would have letters C to H free to assign to another PC's networkdrive.andP;  (There is a problem in that some software takes LASTDRIVE to be thenumber of drives within your PC, others take it to mean the maximum includingthe shared network drives.)andM;Using a networkandM;Now you can use your network.andP;  But for what?andP;  Networks provide an excellentmethod of resource sharing.andP;  That is, if you have one fast machine with a bighard disk and you install a network, then all your diskless PCs can be madeto feel as if they have all those facilities for themselves.andP;  The other majorattraction is the ability to run one application across a network.andM;Brace yourselves for myth number one: only special network versions ofsoftware will run.andP;  False.andP;  You can install almost any application (with theexception of some 'naughty' programs such as TSRs and some graphicsapplications) on a network and run it from one workstation.andP;  The problemscommence if more than one user on the network tries to run it at the sametime.andP;  First, you'll be in breach of the software copyright agreement;second, the non-networked version won't support file locking.andM;File locking involves the application that is currently running puttingthrough a special call to DOS and is one answer to the perennial networkproblem: there's an original file, you open it in your word processor,someone else opens the same original file.andP;  You go on to make some changesand save the result.andP;  The other user also makes some changes to theiroriginal file and saves it, overwriting your changes.andM;The usual method to get around this is to warn a user that they can look at afile that is already in use but no change anything in it.andP;  You can appreciatethat for something like a database, being unable to change any of thecontents of a file is rather incovenient, hence the use of record locking.andO;This is a more advanced version of file locking and it prevents more than oneuser changing a particular record within a file.andM;Final considerationsandM;This should have given you a brief insight into the workings of a network.andO;Before you decide to install one, bear two points in mind: first, as ageneral rule, network device drivers will eat up around 50Kb of workstationRAM (often more).andP;  Your workstation will also appear to operate more slowlybecause files and programs are being fetched from a hard disk 50 metres away.andM;Second, networks are expensive in both real and hidden terms.andP;  In real terms,you'll probably have to invest in new network versions of your currentsoftware, buy all the driver boards, the system software and the cabling.andP;  Inhidden terms, someone will have to carry out system manager tasks every weekor so -- do they get paid extra for that?andP;  And who trains the users to getover the initial (and big) learning curve?andM;The benefits of networking are substantial -- if, that is, your sitewarranted a network in the first place.andM;But think carefully whether your office works as a team, sharing data andprograms: if so, a network will improve life enormously.andP;  If not, you'llwaste a lot of money, time and sweat.andM;Networking terms in briefandM;Centalized network: A network based around a central server which deals, byitself, with all the network commands and tasks.andM;CSMA/CD: Carrier Sense, Multiple Access/Collision Detect.andP;  This is the methodused by Ethernet systems to determine if any other station is trasmittingdata.andP;  If a station tries to transmit and it gets collision signal, it waits,then has another go.andM;Distributed network: A network with no central server.andP;  Each computer on thenetwork does some of the chores.andM;Drive mappings: Drive letters assigned to disk drives on a remote computer toallow DOS to access them correctly.andM;Ethernet: A network protocol developed by Xerox, mainly used by 3Com.andP;  Thisis a high-speed transmission system as long as the loads remains manageable.andM;File locking: A feature of DOS that prevents a file being edited by one userif it is already opened by another user.andM;NetBIOS: A standard method for system and application software to communicatewith network hardware.andM;Packet: An amount of data sent along with information giving its destination,it source and error-correcting information.andM;Protocol: Standards defining all the steps in sending the data along thecable as well as the form that data takes.andP;  This allows manufacturers toproduce compatible equipment.andM;Record locking: A finer version of file locking that prevents two usersediting the same record within a file at the same time.andM;Resource: A disk drive, printer or other peripheral connected to a network.andM;Resource sharing: Most network operating systems allow the ability to use thedisk drives or printers of another computer on the network as if they werepart of your own PC.andM;Server/Fileserver.andP;  A machine that spends most or all of time looking afternetwork tasks.andP;  In a centralized network, the system software andapplications are installed on the server and reached using workstations.andM;Token Ring: Network protocol using a ring network around which travels a&quot;token'.andP;  If a station wants to transmit data, it waits for the token, checksit's free and, if it is, uses it.andP;  This usually operates at 4Mbps or 10Mbps,but provides better load-handling characteristics than other protocols.andM;User: A record defining a person authorized to use the network, giving theirname, password and rights.andM;You get what you pay forandM;Low-cost networksandM;These usually cost less than 152 pounds sterling per user and offer basicfacilities such as electronic mail, password protection and resource sharing.andO;There's no central server, it being a distributed network.andP;  They usually usethe twisted pair technology and aren't particularly fast.andP;  A maximum ofanywhere between eight and 64 users can be linked together -- but theresponse time for more than eight users will be very slow.andM;Medium-price networksandM;These are usually limited-user versions of the big networks and offer amaximum of eight or 10 users all the benefits of a big netowrk based onEthernet or Token Ring Technology.andP;  These require a central server -- atleast a fast 286 machine, or a 386 for a decent response time.andP;  The servercan be non-dedicated, allowing it to function as a workstation at the sametime as it's covering its server tasks.andP;  The facilities should include goodsecurity, password protection and audit trails to see who's doing what, thison top of the usual electronic mail, printer and resource sharing.andM;High-end networksandM;The software alone usually retails for 3,000 pounds sterling or 4,000 poundssterling, and these networks require a dedicated 386-based server with a fasthard disk for decent performance.andP;  However, this setup will support up to(normally) 255 users with not too much difficulty.andP;  Several networks can belinked together to expand a system or increase computing power.andP;  These shouldalso be facilities for disk mirroring -- two hard disks doing the same thingjust in case one breaks down -- and some form of fault tolerance to ensurethe easy recovery of damaged files.andM;The two main protocolsandM;Token RingandM;This is the standard adopted by IBM, and as such has a lot of clout.andP;  Itworks by sending a 'packet' of data around a network ring at a rate ofbetween four and 16 million bits a second.andP;  As each workstation wants to sendsomething, it just waits for an empty packet to come past, then fills it withdata.andP;  The advantage is that even under a heavy load, it'll perform well.andO;However, for a two station network, it's not as fast as Ethernet.andP;  Thecabling is thick but not fragile, and has a maximum range between connectionpoints (MAUs) of about 300 metres.andM;EthernetandM;This is based on a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access/CollisionDetection) technique.andP;  That means before trying to send data each workstationwill do a test run and, if it finds someone else is using it; will wait thenhave another go.andP;  This makes for very high speed data rates on a smallnetwork, but it'll get clogged up on a very heavily used system.andP;  The cablingis also breakable (if badly treated) but can often run for lengths of 500metres.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
