But that doesn't mean the Treasury will have much difficulty selling $26 billion of notes and bonds in its quarterly refunding this week.    &quot;Sure, people are nervous about the economy's strength, a potential dollar decline and (possible) tighter credit by the Federal Reserve,&quot; says E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. But it's unclear how fast rates may rise, and &quot;Treasury bonds are the cheapest they've been all year.&quot;    So when the government auctions $8.75 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $8.75 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $8.5 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday, Mr. Coats anticipates &quot;a sudden wave of buying. If yields get to 9.2% or 9.25%, it's almost a certainty,&quot; he says.    The latest U.S. employment report, showing a drop in the April jobless rate to a 14-year low, helped drive the yield on the government's benchmark 30-year bond to about 9.15% Friday, its highest level since Dec. 20, when it yielded 9.2%. The employment report is &quot;just the beginning&quot; of a whole slew of forthcoming reports suggesting &quot;the economy is expanding at a faster pace,&quot; says John Paulus, a managing director and chief economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;That means higher interest rates.&quot;    Even so, Treasury bonds yielding 9.25% &quot;are a good bet in the near term,&quot; says Wayne Wong, a managing director at the money management concern Marinvest. &quot;Japanese investors will participate in the auctions with yields ranging between 9.13% and 9.25%.&quot;    Robert Giordano, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and co-director of its economic research department, has been consistently gloomy about the outlook for interest rates. In January, when the yield on the government's 30-year bond was nearly 8.25%, he said yields would rise into double digits in the next 18 months.    Mr. Giordano still thinks the bond market &quot;is on thin ice.&quot; But he says &quot;too many people have become too negative too soon. The Treasury doesn't usually have any difficulty during the auctions and it probably won't have difficulty this time. There's always a little candy to dish out with the beets,&quot; he adds.    Investor fear of rising inflation has been the main catalyst for higher bond yields the past two months. Average hourly earnings and the Labor Department's hourly earnings index, two inflation measures in the latest employment report, showed big increases that may prompt the Fed to tighten credit.    &quot;If there's any downward pressure on the dollar, the Fed will probably raise&quot; the federal funds rate, or the lending fee it charges banks and other financial institutions, to more than 7% from about 6 7/8% currently, says Edward A. Treichel, vice president and investment strategist for the Van Kampen Investment Advisory Group. Higher short-term rates might even help stabilize the bond market, by showing the Fed's resolve to quell potential inflation pressure.    Growing skittishness toward Treasury bonds has made their yields &quot;increasingly attractive relative to British, French, West German and Japanese bond yields,&quot; says Mr. Coats of Salomon Brothers. For instance, some actively traded 10-year government issues yield at least four percentage points more than similar-maturity Japanese government issues. The narrowing yield margins of U.S. corporate and mortgage-backed bonds over similar-maturity Treasurys are another indication that the &quot;government market is comparatively cheap,&quot; he contends.    Mr. Treichel agrees: &quot;Treasury bonds look like the best value right now in the U.S. bond market.&quot;    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   The decline in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.4% from 5.6% last month helped drive long-term interest rates to their highest levels this year amid growing investor fear of inflation.    Prices of some actively traded 30-year bonds fell almost 5/8 point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Short-term interest rates also spurted higher.    The price of the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to 97 1/8 from 97 22/32 Thursday. The yield rose to 9.16% from 9.1%. The price of the Treasury's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 fell to 94 11/32 from 94 27/32. The yield rose to 9% from 8.92%. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 5.84 points to 1231.84. The index ranged between 1230.14 and 1235.88.    Among short-term interest rates, the rate on the Treasury's recently issued three-month bill rose to 6.29% bid from 6.2% bid. The rate on the Treasury's six-month bill rose to 6.5% bid from 6.39% bid.    The rate on federal funds averaged 6.86%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). The rate was unchanged from Thursday. </TEXT></DOC>
