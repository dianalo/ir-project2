Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR CMD NDX </IN><G> SEC CFT </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal securities and futures regulators approved &quot;circuit breaker&quot; plans to interrupt all stock-related trading after big drops in the markets.    As approved, the plans, which were developed in response to the crash that occurred a year ago today, omit the contigency clauses originally insisted on by the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange. Those exchanges had said enactment of their plans was subject to the adoption of similar predetermined plans to halt trading by all other domestic markets.    The Big Board dropped the contingency clause Monday to expedite SEC approval, an exchange spokesman said. He noted that the regional stock exchanges haven't submitted their own circuit-breaker plans, but are expected to do so soon.    The Big Board's trading-halt system, which is being adopted as a one-year experimental program, goes into effect at the close of business today, the spokesman said. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades the most popular stock-futures contract, said its own system of halts will take effect simultaneously.    Under the plans approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, stock trading will halt for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummets 250 or more points from its previous day's closing level. Similarly, stock-related futures trading will halt for the same period when futures fall an equivalent level.    A second closing for two hours will occur if the industrial average falls 400 points below the previous close. Stock-related futures would follow suit. In addition, trading in stock-index options will halt after circuit breakers have been activated in the futures markets.    Regulatory approval of the plan had long been expected.    The SEC reviewed the marketwide trading halts as part of a package of related Big Board proposals it approved yesterday.    Under the package, certain trading changes will begin when the industrial average moves 25 points from the previous day's close. At that point, individual investors' small orders will gain priority use of the Big Board's high-speed order system.    The SEC also approved a trading change that would occur when the price of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, falls 12 points, about the equivalent of a 96-point drop of the industrial average. At that point, the Merc would place restrictions on trading for a half-hour.    Meanwhile, the Big Board's computers would sidetrack program trades into a separate queue, where the computer would try to match buy and sell program trades. After five minutes, trading in an individual stock affected by heavy program trading could be halted.    This limit on program trading replaces the Big Board's 50-point &quot;collar&quot; on program trading implemented earlier this year. </TEXT></DOC>
