Plant scientists at several companies including MonsantoCo., have poured millions of dollars into what appears to bea successful attempt to take genes from a bacterium called Bt(for Bacillus thurigiensis) and put them into plants. Thegenes produce proteins that kill insects by interfering withtheir digestion. Laboratory and greenhouse tests show that abug taking a bite out of a plant carrying one of thesebacterial genes will quickly discover it's eaten its lastmeal.</LP><TEXT>   The genetic engineering feat is so promising, Monsanto hasbeen conducting field trials of cotton plants incorporatingthe Bt gene for two years.   But a group of entomologists from the University of Hawaiisay they have documented cases in Hawaiian watercress fieldsin which the diamondback moth, a common pest, has developedstrong resistance to insecticide sprays containing a Bttoxin. &quot;The results of our study put to rest the notion thatBt will be a permanent solution to our pest problems,&quot; saidBruce Tabashnik, professor of entomology and one of theresearchers, &quot;There was a perception until recently thatinsects won't develop resistance to Bt as they have tochemical pesticides.&quot;   Prof. Tabashnik said the diamondback moth's resistance toBt should also be seen as &quot;an early warning that otherinsects can develop resistance&quot; to other strains of Bt. Anumber of companies -- Monsanto, Ecogen Inc., Du Pont Co.,Calgene Inc., Entotech Inc., Agracetus, a subsidiary of W. R.Grace andamp; Co. -- have developed or are currently testingdifferent strains of the bacterium against such pests ascottonplant eating caterpillars, corn borers, and potatobeetles.   Some of these companies expressed concern over theevidence collected in Hawaii, but said it wasn't conclusive.Also they have already been pursuing strategies that take Btresistance into account.   Some companies are using the Bt-toxin in the form ofsprays, such as the ones used on the fields in Hawaii, andothers, like Monsanto, are engineering the gene for the toxinright into the crop.   Monsanto is considering incorporating into the plants morethan one strain of the bacterium. &quot;There is a low probabilitythat the insect will develop resistance to both at the sametime,&quot; said Randy Deaton, a scientist at its plant sciencesunit.   Chi-Li Liu, who heads the microbiology operation atEntotech, a Davis, Calif., unit of Novo Nordisk of Denmark,said her company is closely monitoring the fields where itsBt-based insecticide sprays are used. &quot;We don't believe thatif Bt pesticides are properly used by farmers insects woulddevelop resistance,&quot; she said. Entotech recommends farmersrotate Bt-based pesticides with the traditionalchemical-based products and rotating crops.   But Prof. Tabashnik believes that the evidence ofresistance developed by the diamondback moth is likely todamp the heavy reliance of companies on Bt for biologicalcontrol of pests. He said there have been other convincingreports of resistance developing in moths in Florida, Japan,and the Philippines. The diamondback moth is a pest ofcabbage, broccoli, watercress, and brussel sprouts, amongother crops.   It's uncertain how long it takes for an insect to developa resistance to the Bt toxins. The Hawaiian fields whereProf. Tabashnik and his co-researchers found moth resistancehad been using sprays containing Bt from 1978 to 1982, andagain from 1988 to present.</TEXT></DOC>
