(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A powerful state senator goes on trialMonday amid strong indications that the federal corruptioninvestigation that led to his indictment could result in chargesagainst two other lawmakers.   State Sen. Joe Montoya, who chairs the Senate Business andProfessions Committee, has pleaded innocent to 12 felony countsthat accuse him of racketeering, extortion, bribery and moneylaundering. Among the alleged victims of his shakedown efforts:actor Ed Asner.   If convicted, Montoya faces a maximum of 220 years in prison andmore than $3 million in fines.   The Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte, who's beenin the Legislature for 17 years, is the first person to be tried asa result of an investigation that began in 1985.   The investigation included agents who posed as Alabamabusinessmen seeking a bill to aid a shrimp-importing company theyhoped to establish, and a Senate aide who cooperated with theagents by wearing a hidden recording device. The bill waseventually passed, but Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tippedoff by the FBI, vetoed it.   The probe became public in dramatic fashion in August 1988, when30 federal agents raided the Capitol offices of Montoya, threeother lawmakers and their aides. There were reports that during theraid, aides in some offices shredded documents and erased sensitivecomputer information.   Besides Montoya, one of his former aides, an Assembly aide, aformer Yolo County sheriff and a former undersheriff have also beencharged. And while prosecutors are saying little about theinvestigation, a plea bargain reached last week could mean at leasttwo other lawmakers will face charges.   Karin Watson, a key aide to Assembly Republicans, pleaded guiltyTuesday to one extortion count and agreed to help prosecutors. Thatdevelopment could spell trouble for the two Republican Assemblymembers whose offices were searched 15 months ago, Pat Nolan ofGlendale and Frank Hill of Whittier.   According to papers filed in the case, Watson played a key rolein setting up two meetings in June 1988 at which $12,500 was paidto an undercover agent. News articles have linked Nolan and Hill tothose meetings. Both have denied wrongdoing.   Montoya's attorney, Michael Sands, refused to discuss the caselast week. But Sands said in an earlier interview that he was``convinced that Montoya's position can be sustained.''   According to Senate aides, defense attorneys have subpoenaedabout half the 40 members of the Senate to testify at the trial,apparently in an attempt to show that Montoya's actions were notout of the ordinary.   Among other things, Montoya is accused of accepting a $3,000``honorarium'' from an undercover agent in exchange for help ingetting the bill to help the fictional shrimp business through theSenate.   The charge alleging an extortion attempt against Asner stemsfrom a 1985 meeting, at the time the popular actor, known for hisroles in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Lou Grant'' and``Roots,'' was president of the Screen Actors Guild.   According to a memorandum filed by prosecutors last month, Asnerand a lobbyist for the guild went to see Montoya in May 1985 toseek his vote against a bill their union opposed.   ``Montoya took the two into his office and closed the door,''the memorandum said. ``He then stated in no uncertain terms that hedid not see why he should support the guild since the guild had notmade financial contributions to him.''   The memo said Asner and the lobbyist were ``infuriated anddisgusted'' and the meeting ended abruptly. Montoya voted againstthe guild's side that afternoon, the memo added.   In another incident, prosecutors alleged, Montoya wrote lettersto all California high school principals, urging them not to insuretheir athletes with a particular insurance company. The letterswere written after the company's owner refused to pay Montoya$10,000 for support of legislation backed by the company, thememorandum said.   A key figure in the investigation, the memorandum said, was JohnShahabian, a Senate staffer who tried to extort an undercover agentand then agreed to cooperate with the FBI in exchange for lenienttreatment.   In June 1988, Shahabian asked an unidentified legislator what itwould take to get the shrimp legislation out of the Senate Bankingand Commerce Committee, the memorandum said.   ``Well, you need to make some arrangements with Joe,'' thelawmaker reportedly told Shahabian. ``What it'll take with Joe is alittle envelope.''   Later that month, Shahabian, wearing a hidden recording device,went to see Montoya. Montoya asked if the organizers of shrimp dealwere ``doing well,'' and learning that they were, replied, ``OK, sothey can be helpful.''   Later in the conversation, after Montoya was assured that thebill would attract little attention, Shahabian asked, ``How can webe helpful to you?''   ``Either way, (campaign) contributions and@or honorariums,''Montoya reportedly said. A luncheon meeting was set up with theundercover agent, at which time the $3,000 check was passed toMontoya, the memo said.</TEXT></DOC>
