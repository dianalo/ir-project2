To attain this goal, DOE continuously evaluates new technologiesto determine their potential in contributing to the Program. One suchtechnology is artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer sciencethat, in recent years, has begun to impact the marketplace in a numberof fields. Expert systems techniques can (and in some cases, alreadyhave been) be applied to develop computer-based &quot;advisors&quot; to assistdrilling personnel in areas such as designing mud systems, casing plans,and cement programs, optimizing drill bit selection and bottom hole asssembly(BHA) design, and alleviating lost circulation, stuck pipe, fishing,and cement problems. Intelligent machines with sensor and/or roboticdirectly linked to AI systems, have potential applications in areas ofbit control, rig hydraulics, pipe handling, and pipe inspection. Usinga well costing spreadsheet, the potential savings that could be attributedto each of these systems was calculated for three base cases: a dry steamwell at The Geysers, a medium-depth Imperial Valley well, and a deepImperial Valley well. Based on the average potential savings to be realized,expert systems for handling lost circulation problems and for BHA designare the most likely to produce significant results. Automated bit controland rig hydraulics also exhibit high potential savings, but these savingsare extremely sensitive to the assumptions of improved drilling efficiencyand the cost of these sytems at the rig. 50 refs., 19 figs., 17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
