Expectations about the meeting's outcome, coupled with speculation about possible Japanese and West German interest-rate cuts and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee today, prompted many traders to take profits by buying back dollars sold earlier at higher levels, halting the U.S. currency's most recent plunge.    &quot;The Baker-Miyazawa meeting certainly has bullish implications&quot; for the dollar, said Frank Pusateri, senior corporate trader at Bank of Boston. &quot;The meeting, plus Volcker's testimony and other factors, was enough to turn the market around.&quot;    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8375 West German marks, up 1.6% from 1.8080 in late Monday trading in London. (New York interbank trading was idle Monday for the holiday marking Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.) The dollar also climbed 1.2% to 152.68 Japanese yen, from 150.80, and 1.9% to 1.5438 Swiss francs, from 1.5148.    In mid-morning trading in Asia Wednesday, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese currency to 153.30 yen from 152.68 in New York yesterday afternoon.    As the dollar rebounded, gold prices posted their steepest declines in 22 months and other precious metals also plunged. Bond prices edged higher in response to the dollar's rise.    The White House yesterday confirmed that the subject of the Baker-Miyazawa meeting primarily will be conditions in the foreign-exchange market. Traders believe Japan, which bought billions of dollars in currency markets in recent days to slow a steep slide in the dollar, will seek an agreement with the U.S. on measures to stabilize exchange rates. That possibility prompted yesterday's dollar recovery.    But traders generally are doubtful that the U.S. is prepared to do anything to discourage the dollar's decline, which, prior to yesterday's rebound, amounted to losses of 5.8% against the mark and 4.8% against the yen since the beginning of the year.    To head off further declines, &quot;Baker will have to say that he's satisfied with the level of the dollar,&quot; said Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia. &quot;I don't think he'll be able to say that because of political pressure in Congress.&quot;    The Reagan administration has allowed the dollar to plummet over the past 22 months, and at times has actively encouraged the decline, to help reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit and fight protectionist pressure in Congress. A weaker dollar makes U.S. products more competitive abroad and imports more expensive for Americans.    &quot;Whatever pronouncement comes out of the meeting, the market will jump all over it,&quot; said Mr. Pusateri of Bank of Boston. &quot;In terms of reversing the dollar's decline, we have to hear something specific.&quot; Referring to Mr. Baker, he said: &quot;People are looking for a statement that the dollar has gone down far enough. If we don't see it in black and white, we're going to assume the administration wants the dollar to go lower.&quot;    He added that a &quot;vague&quot; statement following today's meeting won't convince foreign-exchange traders that the U.S. wants anything but a further depreciation of the dollar.    Following a meeting between Messrs. Baker and Miyazawa at the end of October, the two officials issued a joint statement calling the dollar's level &quot;broadly consistent with the present underlying fundamentals,&quot; and noted their &quot;willingness to cooperate on exchange-rate issues.&quot; In the wake of that meeting, the dollar stabilized above 160 yen until the record $19.22 billion November U.S. trade deficit was announced in late December.    The October statement was accompanied by a Japanese discount-rate cut. Yesterday, the dollar found support from speculation that interest rates will be lowered by the Japanese and West German central banks. Lower interest rates abroad would tend to strengthen the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments relatively more attractive.    A Japanese newspaper reported yesterday that the Bank of Japan is willing to cut its discount rate if the U.S. promises to intervene in currency markets to keep the dollar and yen stable. And early Wednesday the Kyodo news service reported that the rate reduction probably would be about 0.5 of a percentage point. The plan, which reportedly will be proposed by Mr. Miyazawa today, would help Japan spur its sluggish economy. The dollar's weakness against the yen has hurt Japanese exports.    Although it is widely believed that the Bundesbank is leaning toward an interest-rate cut to stem the slide of the dollar, some sources close to the German central bank believe such a cut probably will be postponed until after Sunday's national election.    &quot;I am convinced we will see a reduction in rates,&quot; said one official, &quot;but I am also convinced they won't take action on Thursday,&quot; when the policy-making central bank council holds its biweekly meeting.    One government official, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had been told by a member of the Bundesbank's 18-member council that &quot;a majority&quot; of the panel seemed to now favor cutting the discount and Lombard rates, but not before the election. He suggested that the council may decide to lower interest rates but not implement its decision until after the election.    The discount rate is charged on short-term borrowings by commercial banks from the central bank. The Lombard rate is similar, but traditionally is meant only for last-resort financing and therefore is higher. The Lombard rate is the rate at which the Bundesbank provides overnight liquidity to the banking system.    Several sources suggested that even with the dollar's decline, the Bundesbank may be hesitant to cut its key rates. In particular, they said, cutting interest rates is thought to be the central bank's last defensive measure to fight a decline in the dollar. Other stopgap measures, such as allowing money-market rates to dip, could be implemented before a formal rate cut, they argued.    &quot;They have to keep their powder dry,&quot; said one source. An interest-rate cut, he said, could prove ineffective, and &quot;then they'd really be in a fix.&quot;    This source and others suggested that the council may prefer to delay any action on interest rates until it sees whether a cooperative accord can be reached with the U.S., such as the one discussed last August. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl offered then to cut interest rates if the U.S. would take actions to stabilize the dollar, sources said, but the possible compromise fell through when U.S. officials failed to respond to the offer.    Meanwhile, Mr. Volcker's scheduled testimony today before the Senate banking panel worried some dollar bears because the Fed chairman has often warned in past trips to Capitol Hill of the possible negative effects of an overly sharp decline in the dollar's value. Mr. Volcker has noted that a dollar free-fall could revive inflation and frighten away foreign investment needed to fund the huge U.S. budget deficit.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery fell $15 an ounce to $407.40 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was 6.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $408.25 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
