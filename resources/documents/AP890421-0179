Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert called Hudson's behavior``outrageous and reprehensible'' for not telling his lover of hisAIDS diagnosis, but he said the jury's ``passion'' had led it tomake an excessive award.   In his written ruling, Geernaert said that both the compensatoryand punitive damages were excessive and he felt that the amounts heset were sufficient to compensate Christian.   Christian's lawyer, Harold Rhoden, said his client ``was asdisappointed as I am.'' But Christian later said he was delightedeven at the prospect of getting less than a third of what the jurydecided he should receive.   Reached by telephone, Christian said he still felt he wonbecause the judge had removed any reason for appeal on grounds ofexcessive damages.   ``It's still a big award'' he said, noting he never expectedrealistically to collect the larger figure.   ``It was more symbolic than anything else,'' Christian said,adding he believed the $5.5 million award ``still sends the samemessage out,'' that those with AIDS must warn their sex partners.   But Robert Parker Mills, the attorney for the Hudson estate,said he believes his clients probably will appeal.   ``There's not any evidence I can see that would substantiate a$5 million award to this man,'' said Mills.   The judge said he had given the matter much thought since anearlier hearing when he suggested a figure of $3 million inpunitive damages.   ``Upon further reflection, in light of the entire record, apunitive damage award of $500,000 seems to fairly accomodate ...the pertinent factors,'' Geernaert said. He set compensatorydamages at $5 million.   Geenaert specified that these reductions would go into effectonly if Christian accepts them. If he does not consent, Geernaertsaid he would order a new trial on damages.   ``The court finds that the jury's award of $14.5 million (incompensatory damages) is so high that it must be concluded that theaward is based in part on passion resulting from the jury'sevaluation of the outrageous and reprehensible nature of theconduct of Rock Hudson and defendant (Hudson secretary Mark)Miller,'' the judge said.   He added that substantial evidence supported Christian's claimof enhanced fear of contracting AIDS after he learned that Hudsonhad the disease.   ``On the other hand, however serious plaintiff's distress mightbe when he first learned of Hudson's AIDS, such emotional distresswould become somewhat less over time,'' the judge said.   ``Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiff's emotionaldistress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff hassuffered any tangible economic loss.''   Lawyers for Hudson's estate tried to show during the often luridtrial testimony that Christian's affair with Hudson was over by thetime the star's disease was discovered. Hudson died at age 58 onOct. 5, 1985.   The jury rejected that argument and decided in February thatHudson was guilty of ``outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDSdiagnosis from Christian, his lover for two years. Christian saidhe didn't learn of the star's illness until a few months beforeHudson died.   The jury awarded Christian $14.5 million compensatory damagesand $7.25 million in punitive damages to compensate for the fear hesuffered.   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' he testified.   Although Christian did not contract AIDS and has tested negativefor the virus, the judge and jury found he deserved damages, aruling unique in personal injury law on sexually transmitteddiseases. In previous cases, only plaintiffs who developed thediseases have collected damages.   Miller, Hudson's secretary, also was found liable for damages.The jury said he conspired with the actor to keep Christian in thedark about the AIDS diagnosis so that the younger man wouldcontinue to engage in sex with Hudson. The jury assessed $7.25million in punitive damages against Miller alone since an estatecannot be held liable for such damages, which are intended topunish and set an example.   In papers filed in recent days, the Hudson estate lawyers hadurged the judge to give Christian no more than $1 million and aslittle as $100,000. Lawyers for Miller insisted that Christian isentitled to no punitive damages.</TEXT></DOC>
