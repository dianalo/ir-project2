President Virgilio Barco outlined the proposal in a televisedaddress Thursday night and Government Minister Cesar Gaviria gavedetails Friday.   Barco said guerrilla violence must end before direct contactsare made.   Guerrilla violence has claimed more than 75,000 lives in 20years and the estimated numerical strength of rebel groups hasgrown from 2,500 to 10,000 in a decade.   Over the past year the guerrillas have blown up oil pipelines 45times, attacked 14 towns, set off car bombs, attacked militarybases, ambushed army patrols and destroyed bridges, electricitytransmission towers and other government facilities.   They have kidnapped dozens of ranchers for ransom since theearly 1980s and also have a U.S. captive _ Jake Gambini of Houston,Tex., owner of General Pipe Co. He was kidnapped two months agofrom an oil company camp in Colombia's eastern plains but therehave been no reports of ransom demands.   Gaviria, who is in charge of internal security, said preliminarycontacts with guerrillas can begin as soon as they end hostilities.   After the cease-fire and initial contacts, the rebels would beallowed to give Congress their proposals for change, the ministersaid in an interview with the RCN radio network.   Barco said Thursday night the peace plan's objective wasdisbanding the guerrilla groups, and he repeated an amnesty offermade last month.   This is the second time a Colombian government has tried tonegotiate with the insurgents. In 1982, President BelisarioBetancur offered an amnesty and signed a truce with four ofColombia's six rebel armies.   Only about 300 guerrillas accepted pardons and the cease-firecollapsed, with rebels and the military accusing each other ofviolating it.   Barco's plan differs in two important aspects _ provisions fordirect negotiations with the government and submission of guerrillaproposals to Congress.   Betancur met with guerrilla representatives twice but hisnegotiators were not government officials, which led the rebels tosuspect he did not take the process seriously.   Gaviria said the proporsed negotations would be handled byhimself and Barco's personal representative for guerrilla contacts,Rafael Pardo Rueda, who was appointed last year and has met withguerrilla leaders several times.   No guerrilla reaction is expected for several days. Gaviria saidthe insurgents were not given details in advance.</TEXT></DOC>
