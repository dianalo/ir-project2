The company also said that it and its Napco International Inc. subsidiary will continue to receive export licenses granted by the State Department.    Venturian, a maker of military parts and communications equipment, previously pleaded guilty to bribing officials of the Republic of Niger to get them to buy its defense-related products. Venturian agreed to pay $1 million in criminal fines, penalties, taxes and restitution.    By pleading guilty to breaching the corrupt-practices law, Venturian could be barred from getting future Defense Department contracts and stripped by the State Department of export licenses needed to do business abroad.    Venturian said it is continuing discussions with the Defense Department to avoid potential debarment. No action has been taken on the government's part that would prohibit the company from receiving new U.S. government business, Venturian said. </TEXT></DOC>
