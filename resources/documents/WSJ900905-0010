Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/05/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><IN>MEDICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY (MTC)</IN><LP>   BETHESDA, Md. -- Medical researchers have linkedosteoarthritis to a genetic defect, a discovery that couldlead to new treatments for a condition that disables millionsof old people.   Osteoarthritis, a disintegration of the cartilage betweenbones, produces pain, stiffness and lack of mobility. Thedisease has long been considered an inevitable consequence ofaging. But the new findings, announced at the NationalInstitutes of Health, suggest that therapies may be able tostop or slow its progression.</LP><TEXT>   The latest findings emerged from research supported by theNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and SkinDiseases, part of the NIH, and the private ArthritisFoundation. A team of researchers led by Roland Moskowitz,rheumatologist at Case Western Reserve University inCleveland, examined a three-generation family in whichosteoarthritis seemed to be an inherited trait.   Dr. Moskowitz and his team then collaborated withresearchers led by Darwin Prockop, a molecular biologist atJefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, to find thespecific genetic mutation that produced weak cartilage.   The researchers were quick to note that the findings don'tmean that all osteoarthritis results from genetic flaws orthat it will be easy to find new therapies for a disease forwhich there is currently no cure. The conclusions, announcedyesterday and published in Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences, were based primarily on researchinvolving people in one family, while osteoarthritis afflictsnearly 16 million Americans.   &quot;We're not making any claims or promises based on thisresearch&quot; because much more work needs to be done to learnhow broadly osteoarthritis is tied to genetic mutations, saidLawrence Shulman, director of the National Institute ofArthritis.   But independent analysts called the work a potentialbreakthrough. Paul Katz, chief of the division ofrheumatology, immunology and allergy at the GeorgetownUniversity Medical School, said the research should lead to abetter understanding of &quot;the biochemistry of cartilagedisintegration&quot; that could help researchers &quot;developtherapies to prevent its progression.&quot;   The primary treatments for osteoarthritis today includerest and anti-inflammatory medicines to control pain. Inaddition, many of the 150,000 hip, knee and other jointreplacements performed each year are tied to osteoarthritis.Any new therapy that slows the progress of osteoarthritiswould greatly improve the quality of life of many olderpeople and reduce Medicare costs for treating the disease.   In the family they studied, the researchers found adefective gene for collagen II, a protein the strengthens thecartilage. Of the more than 1,000 amino acids that constructcollagen II, the faulty gene mistakenly directed the exchangeof an amino acid called cysteine for arginine, the correctsubstance. &quot;This one amino acid substitution in collagen IIcould wreak havoc on the integrity of the cartilage,&quot; Dr.Prockop said.   The isolation of a mutant gene that triggeredosteoarthritis in one family &quot;gives us a plan for futureresearch,&quot; Dr. Prockop said. The researchers are planningstudies to determine how common the genetic mutation is.   In cases where a mutation is identified as the cause ofosteoarthritis, doctors will have several options theycurrently lack. First, they can screen members of familieswhere the mutation is found. People with the faulty gene thencan be advised to look for jobs and exercise patterns thatminimize stress on their joints. In addition, scientists canbegin to look for drugs and gene therapies that help counterthe adverse effects of mutations.</TEXT></DOC>
