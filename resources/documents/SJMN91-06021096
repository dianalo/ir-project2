Then hesurprised Weir with it when the group auditioned in Central Park.;    As soonas he heard it, Weir says, he knew he wanted it -- as a parable for theseemingly insurmountable obstacles faced by the film's two main characters,played by Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell.;    &quot;The song throws themessage to the audience to keep your eyes on the prize,&quot; Weir says. &quot;There's alot of hopelessness in the world. . . . Yes, it's just a movie, but it givesyou hope.&quot;;    Before his lucky break, Stewart says, he was &quot;throwing hisfaith away,&quot; a lyric from another of his songs. &quot;That's what I was doing. Ibecame homeless and I stayed that way because of an addiction to drugs.&quot;;   &quot;I got the inspiration from seeing the homeless. If I encourage one person whois homeless, then I've done something,&quot; he added.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Compiled from Mercury News wire services.  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910121  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  317  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 21, 199100021096,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
