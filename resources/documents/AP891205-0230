The world's biggest computer company also said it would setaside $2.3 billion from its pre-tax profit to pay for the job cutsand related steps. That will give IBM a net loss in the fourthquarter and guarantee a decline in 1989 earnings compared to 1988.   The company acknowledged that growth in its home market wasslower than expected as it announced its fourth job-cutting programsince 1986.   IBM is being squeezed by sluggish spending by its customers,increasing competition and the personal computer revolution, whichis cutting into sales of the big mainframes and minicomputers thataccount for most of its profits.   Unisys Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. are among the othercomputer companies that have cut jobs this year. They, too, dependheavily on larger computers for profits.   John Akers, IBM's chairman and chief executive, told a roomfulof stock analysts Tuesday that the computer industry is ``understress _ some would say turmoil.''   Cautious investors, burned by IBM's poor stock performance,barely acknowledged the company's plan. The stock rose a slender37{ cents a share to $99.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading. Itrose $2.12{ a share Monday when speculation intensified that thecompany planned job cuts.   The stock remains far below its peak of $175.87{ in August 1987.   IBM said it would reduce its staff without layoffs by limitinghiring and offering incentives to employees to quit or retire.   The company did not announce any closings of facilities andAkers said no site closings were anticipated. However, someoperations at certain sites could be phased out.   IBM expanded rapidly in the early 1980s but has been cuttingback since 1985, when it became apparent that the industry's rapid15 percent annual growth was slowing.   Tuesday's announcement was among the most dramatic measures yettaken by the company to improve its profitability by cutting costs.IBM said its growth overseas was strong, but the U.S. businessstill was growing more slowly than desired.   ``They have begun to face up to the realities of what theoutlook is for the U.S. market,'' said Barry Bosak, a Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co. analyst. ``I think the ground rules changeddramatically in the 1980s ... and the need to streamlineorganizations is there.''   The job cuts are intended to reduce the company's U.S. workforceto 206,000 by the end of 1990, a reduction of more than 37,000 from1985 levels. IBM had 387,000 employees worldwide at yearend 1988and has been cutting jobs abroad as well.   Akers said IBM intended to continue a no-layoff tradition thathas lasted more than 40 years because it helps the company maintaina high-quality, flexible and dedicated workforce.   He added, ``It's impossible to guarantee for all time fullemployment under any and all circumstances.''   Several analysts agreed that layoffs would be cheaper but woulddamage morale.   IBM said its $4 billion stock buyback, if completed, would bringtotal repurchases since mid-1986 to more than $10.5 billion.   The repurchase amounts to about 15 percent of the sharesoutstanding in 1986 and is possibly the biggest buyback programever undertaken. General Electric Co. last month announced plans torepurchase up to $10 billion of its stock over five years, thelargest program ever in a single announcement.   A stock repurchase pleases investors because by taking sharesoff the market it makes the remaining ones more valuable. It alsosignals that the company is confident about its own stock.   IBM's $2.3 billion pre-tax charge against fourth-quarterearnings breaks down as follows:   _$500 million for separation payments to people leaving thecompany.   _$500 million for accounting changes to recognize the shorteruseful life of IBM's investments in software and technology. Theshorter life is good because it shows the company has acceleratedits schedule of introducing new products.   _$1.3 billion for restructuring, including consolidations,capacity reductions and cuts in the valuation of specialinvestments such as share ownership in other companies.</TEXT></DOC>
