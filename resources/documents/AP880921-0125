(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A black high school student says she wastold to ``go back to the ghetto'' during a football game, promptingschool officials Wednesday to promise to work toward preventingfuture racial clashes.   Shana Cannell, a 14-year-old freshman, said a cheerleader atPekin led other students in racially harassing blacks at the Sept.2 game between the Peoria Lions and the Pekin Dragons.   ``While I was playing in the (Peoria) band, Pekin High Schoolstudents taunted my friends and me with racial slurs such as ...`go back to the ghetto,''' the teen-ager wrote in a letter to theJournal Star of Peoria.   She added that ``one of the more vocal students was a Pekincheerleader who was standing in front of her coach'' and referredto her by a common racial epithet.   Jack Wilt, Pekin School District superintendent, said he hasfound no witnesses but has no reason to doubt the girl's story.Wilt said he plans on offering her a written apology.   ``I can't pinpoint who made the remarks but I don't doubt theywere made,'' Wilt said Wednesday.   Ms. Cannell's father, Julian Cannell, the Peoria School Districtattorney, said an apology ``is not the answer.''   ``My speculation is the teachers and parents in Pekin don'tcare,'' he said. ``They must educate their children that overtracism will not be tolerated in our society.''   Chic Renner, president of the Pekin school board, said Wednesdaythat the remarks of a few students do not reflect the attitudes ofeveryone in Pekin.   Wilt said there is a history of racial problems at athleticevents involving Pekin and Peoria High, which has 1,200 studentsand a 39 percent minority enrollment.   He noted that less than 1 percent of Pekin High's 2,500-memberstudent body is black and only one or two black families live inPekin.   Renner is concerned the incident is rekindling the longstandingperception of Pekin as a racist community.   ``I don't know how long we have to dwell on it,'' he said. ``Werecognize the problem and are trying to deal with it and cure it.''</TEXT></DOC>
