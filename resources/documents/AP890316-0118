(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An adult's right to refuse medicaltreatment in the face of death was upheld Thursday by the FloridaSupreme Court in a case involving a Jehovah's Witness who was forcedto accept blood transfusions.   Privacy rights and religious freedom supersede the medicalprofession's interest in saving lives, the justices ruled 6-1. Thecourt, noting the woman did not want to die, said its ruling was notcondoning suicide.   The decision was a victory for Norma Wons, who sought care foruterine bleeding in April 1986. Doctors said she was lapsing in andout of consciousness and death was imminent at the time.   While still conscious, she fought against receiving transfusionsbecause Jehovah's Witnesses believe it defies a biblical passage inLeviticus, ``Whatsoever man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cuthim off from among his people.''   A court in Miami ordered doctors at the county-run JacksonMemorial Hospital to perform transfusions. Mrs. Wons regainedconsciousness and continued her court battle.   Her attorney, John D. Kelner, said the bleeding is likely torecur.   ``That is one of the things that made the issue not moot with thecourt,'' said Kelner. ``She has expressed her preference in writingthat should she suffer from it again, she be allowed to ... refusetransfusions.''   Hospital officials, represented by the hospital's Public HealthTrust of Dade County, said letting Mrs. Wons die would leave her twochildren without proper nurturing.   Mrs. Wons, 41, argued that her husband supported her decision andthe children would be cared by him, his mother and brothers.   The high court said Mrs. Wons' wasn't necessarily ignoring thebest interest of her children and shouldn't be viewed as returningto a normal life after having been forced to commit a sin againstreligious laws.   Her death may have been necessary to ensure her spiritual life,Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich wrote in a separate opinion agreeingwith the majority.   ``As a parent, ... she also must consider the example she setsfor her children, how to teach them to follow what she believes isGod's law if she herself does not. The choice for her cannot be aneasy one, but it is hers to make,'' Ehrlich wrote.   Justice Ben Overton, in the sole dissent, said Mrs. Wons' deathwould have been unnecessary and guessed the court would havesurprised one of the framers of the U.S. Constitution.   ``To justify, as a right of the free exercise of religion, aparent's right to abandon a minor child through a death which istotally unecessary is, in my view, neither a reasonable nor alogical interpretation of the First Amendment,'' wrote Overton.``James Madison would not believe that his `free exercise' clausecould ever be interpreted in this manner.''</TEXT></DOC>
