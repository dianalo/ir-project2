NRC Commissioner Kenneth Rogers said a recent tour he made of theproposed Yucca Mountain site ``indicates that's a bit of a problem.''   Rogers commented during a briefing by Samuel Rousso, actingdirector of the Energy Department's Office of Civilian RadioactiveWaste Management, on recent waste activities.   The commission will have to decide whether to issue a license,currently scheduled for 1995, to the department for operation of apermanent depot planned for Yucca Mountain. It will store for 10,000years the highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel from the nation'sreactors that is now building up at each reactor site.   It is the first operation of the Energy Department to besubjected to the kind of scrutiny the commission has always givencivilian nuclear power plants. The department's weapons-buildingactivities are exempt from commission rules.   Rousso agreed the waste depot project means ``some change inphilosophy and culture,'' and assured Rogers that ``field personnelwill be trained'' in quality assurance.   Though often confused with quality control, quality assurance isdistinct: It is the proof of quality control, documentation that thework has been done correctly. An example might be a weld in a pipein a nuclear power plant: An X-ray kept on file of the completedweld showing no flaws would be the assurance that the weld had beendone correctly.   In the civilian nuclear power industry, the commission insists ondocumentation of every step of work, and failure to conform has ledsome plants into costly reconstruction before completion.   The waste project ``is imposing a regulatory process onscientists who have not operated in this mode in the past ...geologists, hydrologists,'' Rogers said.   The dismay, he said, surfaced among ``people who were on the tourwith me, some (of them) government people'' who ``expressed a littleconcern about this.''   In his presentation, Rousso noted that the scheduled beginning ofthe first investigative drilling into Yucca Mountain had beendelayed five months to November 1989 ``to ensure that all necessaryquality assurance plans and procedures and other necessarydocumentation and analyses are in place.''   Responding to Rogers, he said, ``Quality assurance is an area wefeel quite strongly about,'' as shown by the formation of a qualityassurance unit several months ago in the Office of CivilianRadioactive Waste Management.</TEXT></DOC>
