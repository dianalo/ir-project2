Still, Mr. Reed says with resignation, &quot;We were brought up as Democrats so I guess I'll go for him.&quot;    There is little doubt that the Democratic presidential nominee will garner the lion's share of votes cast by blacks who go to the polls Nov. 8. But margin of victory and turnout are the critical questions. Whether he wins 75% to 80% of black votes, or 85% to 90%, could be crucial in determining the outcomes in some closely contested states. So, too, could the question of whether blacks will make up more than the approximately 8% of all voters that they did in 1980 and 1984.    As he tries to boost those figures in his favor, Mr. Dukakis is running up against his own personality and background. His cool, cerebral style and general lack of involvement in civil-rights issues -- Massachusetts is less than 4% black -- may work against him in trying to reach these crucial voters.    Concerted voter-registration efforts, plus the excitement generated by Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns, have added an estimated two million black voters to the rolls since 1984. In 1980, 60% of blacks aged 18 and older told the Census Bureau they were registered to vote, compared with 68% of whites; by 1986, the figure for blacks had risen to 64%, compared with 65% for whites. Moreover, some census figures even suggest that young black voters -- the principal focus of Mr. Jackson's efforts -- may even be surpassing whites of their age group in turnout.    &quot;There has been some increase in voter registration and turnout&quot; as a result of Mr. Jackson's efforts, says Ronald Brown, an assistant professor at Eastern Michigan University and one of the directors of a major study on black voting habits. But &quot;the real question,&quot; he says, is &quot;will the new voters turn out and vote?&quot; Many Dukakis field workers and local black officials acknowledge that what Mr. Jackson calls the &quot;margin of enthusiasm&quot; among black voters hasn't expanded as much as had been hoped.    &quot;The excitement of Jackson is going to be difficult for anybody else to capture,&quot; says Jordan Wilson, who is leading voter-registration efforts in New York's Suffolk County. &quot;The person that Jesse reached is going to be difficult for us -- or anybody else -- to reach.&quot;    Meanwhile, &quot;Dukakis faces a paradox, the paradox faced by all recent Democratic candidates,&quot; says Mr. Brown. &quot;He needs black votes in order to win in a very close race, and yet he can't afford to alienate the white middle class.&quot;    A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll provides ample evidence of black voters' dislike for the Reagan administration. In the survey, more than two-thirds of blacks likely to vote said the Reagan administration's economic policies didn't personally benefit them; only 45% of whites felt that way. Fifty-nine percent of blacks, but only 36% of whites, believed that the nation as a whole hasn't benefited from Mr. Reagan's policies. Those numbers translate into a substantial edge for Mr. Dukakis over Vice President George Bush; according to the poll, three-quarters of blacks likely to vote favor Mr. Dukakis.    But that is still fewer than the nine out of 10 black votes that exit polls showed former Vice President Walter Mondale got in 1984 against Ronald Reagan. Even the Dukakis campaign's own polls point up some of the problems. In Louisiana, for instance, a recent poll paid for by the state Dukakis campaign showed that more than one in five black voters were still undecided.    The good news for the Democratic nominee is that a large majority of those undecided black voters who go to the polls are likely to favor him. The danger is that many simply won't vote.    At the heart of many black voters' ambivalence toward Mr. Dukakis seems to be a perception that he is ambivalent toward them. His well-publicized failure to alert Mr. Jackson of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's selection as his running mate, as well as the sometimes strained relations between Mr. Jackson and the Dukakis staff in the general-election campaign, has turned off some black voters through what they see as his offhand treatment of their standard-bearer.    But there is also the candidate's personality. &quot;He has that standoffish style,&quot; says Donna Thompson, a flight-attendants union staffer based in St. Louis and a Dukakis supporter. &quot;We're used to some fire with the words.&quot;    Some observers say the &quot;warmth&quot; issue is a bad rap. &quot;I don't think Mike's problem is he's uncomfortable with black people,&quot; says Thomas C. Adkins, the longtime former president of the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. &quot;I think Mike's problem is he's not comfortable with people in a social situation, period. He doesn't chit-chat.&quot;    Mr. Adkins also disputes the suggestion that Gov. Dukakis sat out the emotion-laden battles over Boston school desegregation in the 1970s. &quot;He was responsive to what we asked him to do,&quot; says Mr. Adkins, now an attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y. &quot;We did not want the issue politicized, and he respected that.&quot;    Still, the Massachusetts governor has muffed some opportunities during the presidential campaign to prove to black voters that he has a strong and emotional commitment to their concerns. This summer, he visited the predominately white Neshoba County, Miss., fair on the 24th anniversary of the murder of three civil-rights workers. Yet he made only a passing reference to the event -- a pledge to bring down the barriers to opportunity on what he called &quot;this special day.&quot; Aides say he later acknowledged that he made a mistake in handling the appearance.    Some complaints go beyond symbolism, arguing that Mr. Dukakis's campaign hasn't put enough effort into registering and turning out black voters. &quot;I'm disappointed that we have a candidate who doesn't have any concern for winning black votes,&quot; says Fannie Lewis, a city councilwoman from Cleveland's Hough neighborhood. &quot;There's no sign he wants votes in black neighborhoods or wants to register people.&quot;    The Dukakis forces vehemently deny this. Suffolk County's Mr. Wilson, who is black, says his campaign hasn't reached its full goal of registering 8,000 additional voters, but &quot;in terms of the amount of attention being paid, the money's there.&quot;    Donna Brazile, deputy field director of the Dukakis campaign, points to a wide-ranging advertising campaign aimed at black audiences through black-owned and black-targeted media. The $3 million to $5 million effort, she says, is the largest media campaign ever directed at black audiences; it includes magazine ads signed by Mr. Jackson, and gospel-backed television and radio ads featuring black politicians and Gov. Dukakis himself.    &quot;We had a lot of ground to cover from not having had the support of the black community during the primaries,&quot; says Ms. Brazile. But she adds that Mr. Dukakis's standing in the black community is continually rising, and &quot;our support is firm.&quot;    ---                   Black Voters' Views   Black support for presidential candidates, 1984 and 1988             1984                       1988    Mondale        91%          Dukakis       74%    Reagan          9%          Bush          11%   Sources: NBC News 1984 election-day voter poll; Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 9/16-9/19/88. -</TEXT></DOC>
