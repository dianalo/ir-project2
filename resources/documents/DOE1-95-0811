A key requirementis that the waste packages be capable of being retrieved during the last26 years of the 76-year repository operating period. The unique designconsiderations relating to the retrieval of waste packages emplaced inbedded salt are presented in this paper. The information is based onthe experience developed during the design of vertical emplacement andretrieval equipment in support of the Sandia Defense High Level Wasteexperiments at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Also included are theimpact of retrievability on the design of the equipment, the specialsalt cutting technology that was developed for this application, anda description of the equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
