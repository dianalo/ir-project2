The Soviet military adventure in its southern neighbor hadclaimed the lives of more than 15,000 Soviet soldiers and left35,000 wounded.   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov was the last soldier to cross the bridgeinto to Soviet city of Termez from the Afghan town of Khairaton, theofficial news agency said.   He walked across the bridge over the Amu-Darya River at 9:55 a.m.Moscow time, Tass said.   A Moscow Radio reporter in Termez said:   ``There they are, standing in front of us, the lads who were thelast to leave ... Two battalions, a reconnaissance one and airborneassault one, left today. Everyone is wearing medals and smiling withsatisfaction.''   ``The dust-covered armored personnel carriers are still. The gunsof many of them are already under cover,'' said the reporter, whosebroadcast was monitored in London.   ``That is it _ this war has come to an end.''   With the forces Gromov commanded gone, major cities held by theSoviet-backed government of President Najib were expected to fall tothe insurgents in a matter of weeks.   Soviet media reported looting by troops of the 30,000-memberAfghan army _ and mass desertions as the guerrillas gain ground.   ``Some garrisons have been plundered. Certain posts andstrongholds transferred to the Afghans have been emptied,'' anarticle in Trud said Tuesday.   ``The political situation in the republic is becoming tense.Attacks by military formations on peaceful cities are increasingdaily, not to mention the artillery and rocket shellings of Kabul,Kandahar, Jalalabad and other big centers. The extremists fromPeshawar don't want a peaceful national settlement,'' it said,referring to the city in western Pakistan where many of theU.S.-supplied guerrillas are based.   The last Soviet troops left Kabul aboard military transportplanes late Tuesday, leaving defense of besieged capital to theconscript Afghan army and Najib's security forces.   A U.N. airlift of food to Kabul, which has been plagued by foodand fuel shortages because of the guerrilla blockade _ has beensuspended for fear the planes would be shot down.   Soviet soldiers intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 _ ayear after a Marxist coup touched off civil war _ and an estimated115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May 15 under aU.N.-mediated agreement.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilev told a newsbriefing in Moscow Tuesday that guerrillas were massing outsidemajor cities _ including about 30,000 around Kabul _ but he did notsay whether they were preparing to attack. He said the withdrawalwas proceeding on schedule.   ``As of Feb. 15, not a single Soviet soldiers will be on Afghanterritory,'' Perfilev said.</TEXT></DOC>
