Ron Clarke, a special assistant to Gov. Steve Cowper, said thereare wide disparities between what top Exxon officials are sayingpublicly and what is happening to the claims of tourism operators.   ``Depending on who you talk to, you get different answers,''Clarke said Thursday.   Bill Tribble, manager of Exxon's Valdez claims office, said thecompany gives priority to ``on-the-water'' claims, and that claimscovering tourism losses on shore will be handled later.   Tourism is a billion-dollar-a-year industry in Alaska. Manysegments already are taking a beating from the spill, which fouledhundreds of miles of beaches along Prince William Sound and thesouthern Alaska coast.   Sport fishing guides, tour boat and bus tour operators arereporting a run of cancellations, and a sharp decrease in thenumber of bookings they normally would be taking this time of year.   Exxon agreed this week to finance a $4 million media blitz aimedat key markets across the country that contribute about one-thirdof the state's visitors each year.   But that general assistance apparently isn't being translated toindividual situations.   Glenn Williams, who runs bus tours out of Eagle River to Homer,Seward and Prince William Sound, said he submitted two claims,totaling more than $30,000, for tours canceled as a direct resultof the spill.   He said his claims were rejected by Exxon, and he was told by aclaims adjuster that ``nobody in tourist-related businesses fallsunder the (reimbursement) guidelines at this time.''   ``I know there's a lot of people losing a lot of bookings,''Williams said. ``Our phones just stopped ringing about three weeksago.''   Exxon spokesman Tribble insisted no such claims have beendenied, but acknowledged they haven't been paid either. He said thecompany's emphasis at this point is to take care of commercialfishermen and tour boat operators.   ``We haven't addressed any type of off-water claims yet,'' saidTribble. ``I'm not saying we're not going to.''   ``Tourism in Alaska is much bigger than me or you or this manwith his 21-day tour,'' Tribble said. ``I don't have the authorityto make that decision.''   Asked who did have the authority, Tribble replied: ``I don'tknow.''   Clarke said he couldn't see any difference between a commercialfisherman's claim and one from a bus tour operator like Williams ora sport fishing guide who lost clients because of the spill.   Clarke said the problem has been particularly severe in Cordova,a community almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing.   He said Exxon had announced earlier Thursday that it would payclaims only to fishermen and processors, and not to ``Main Streetbusinesses'' like restaurants, grocery stores and hardware stores,even though they are totally dependent on fishermen.   ``After considerable haranguing from a lot of quarters,'' Exxonreversed itself, and said it would pay claims for those businessesin Cordova, Clarke said.   He said the state has a written agreement with Exxon promisingto pay the secondary claims in Cordova.   Clarke said the governor's office will continue to try to makeclaims officers follow the policies enunciated publicly by Exxonexecutives.   ``When it gets right down to filing claims, it is something verydifferent,'' Clarke said of Exxon's actions. ``There's a littlefancy footwork going on.''   Clarke said the spill chill has stretched as far south asKetchikan where sport fishing guides have reported cancellations,even though the oil is 700 miles to the northwest.   ``The lack of knowledge of Alaska geography is working againstus,'' Clarke said.</TEXT></DOC>
