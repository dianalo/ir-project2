Now Wall Street seems to be warming up again toward energystocks as the 1990s approach.   ``The oil industry's long dry spell appears to be ending,''declares the Merrill Lynch Market Letter in its current issue.   ``We think it is giving way to an uptrend that will see all themajor facets of the business _ exploration and productionactivities as well as refining and marketing operations _ do wellsimultaneously in the years ahead.''   At another large investment firm, Dean Witter Reynolds, analystJohn Connolly says: ``At long last energy fundamentals look decent.We now believe this group can significantly influence the successor failure of a portfolio.''   Connolly, like many another market-watcher, had beenrecommending that investment managers keep their energy holdingswell below the proportionate weight the group carries in thepopular indexes of stock prices.   Now, he says, ``we have canceled our deep underweighting andopted, for the first time in years, for a slightly overweightedposition.''   Even the most ardent energy bulls don't expect investorssuddenly to rush into a sector of the market that has produced somany disappointments for so long.   But they do foresee at least a gradual recognition of what theydescribe as brightening prospects for both energy demand and energyprices.   ``The demand for oil has increased since 1985 and now is morethan 51 million barrels a day, a level last seen 10 years ago,''Merrill Lynch says.   ``We think demand will increase at an average annual rate of 1million barrels a day over the next few years and that prices willtrend higher, especially if supplies from countries that are notmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries beginto decline.''   Ah yes, OPEC _ the powerful cartel that was supposed to keeppushing oil prices higher and higher for the indefinite futureafter the energy shocks of the 1970s in the industrialized world.   When market conditions got tough, it turned out there were somedeep cracks behind that group's supposedly united front.   But now, Connolly argues, OPEC's leading members have maneuveredthemselves into a position where only a few of them need topractice restraint in their production policies to tip the balanceof supply and demand in their favor.   Furthermore, he adds, ``the most significant development in thenext few years will be a pronounced output decline by the world'slargest producer, the Soviet Union.''   Along with improving business conditions, analysts say, mightcome revived takeover interest in energy companies. Says MerrillLynch, ``higher valuations for refining and marketing facilitieshave boosted the asset values of many oil companies.''   Despite all such arguments, many skeptics remain. Investorstrying to spot a rebound in the oil industry's fortunes have beenfrustrated repeatedly since the mid-1980s.   In his report on the subject, Connolly says he was not an easyconvert to the cause.   ``We have hesitated to commit to the energy area all year,'' hesays. ``In fact, we have hesitated for several years now, provingthat he who hesitates is not always lost.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, Oct. 16.</NOTE></DOC>
