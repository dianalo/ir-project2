Temple Jr., chief of the Guard Bureau, said the companyhad &quot;failed in the objective we set up for them.&quot;andM;According to the investigators, IMA officials said they will not renewAutomation Research Systems' contract, which expired in September.andM;Tom Wilder, an Automation Research Systems project director, disagreed.andP;  Hesaid that on Sept. 30 company officials turned over a completely convertedRPAS and a 98 percent completed SABERS.andP;  He said company officials have beenunsuccessful in efforts to talk to either Powers or the Army National Guarddirector, Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Donald Burdick.andM;On a related subject, investigators said Powers told them theheadquarters-level version of the Standard Installation/Division PersonnelSystem (SIDPERS) ran succesfully on Unisys 1100 machines during testing.andO;Although it was not one of the 15 standard systems, SIDPERS was scheduled forconversion to the minis.andM;At the April hearings, Temple and Burdick said SIDPERS had not beenconverted.andP;  The Guard had issued a stop-work order to the SIDPERS contractor,Stephens Engineering Co. of Greenbelt, Md.andM;Powers, however, told investigators last month the Guard has reinstatedStephens to work on SIDPERS.andP;  Another source said Unisys now is involved inconverting field-level SIDPERS software under a $1 million support contractit has with the Army.andP;  Unisys officials would not confirm or deny that thecompany is working on SIDPERS.andM;Documents submitted during the meeting last month between Powers and theinvesigators also showed none of the other 15 systems has been convertedfully.andP;  In March, Guard officials told Congress 10 of the software systemswould be ready to run on the new minis by the end of this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
