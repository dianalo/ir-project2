apart from anything else,unless a predator has a willing buyer lined up, ICL makes STC well-nighbid-proof, whereas STC stuffed with cash without an immediate home wouldbring out the hostile bidders like stray dogs around a dustbin.andM;-  o  -andM;Sage Software's pact to pay $1.9m for Visual Software isandM;definitive.andM;-  o  -andM;Amdahl Corp warned at its quarterly meeting for analysts that itandM;expects its gross profit margins to continue to be under pressure during 1989because of greater pricing competition from other manufacturers - led by IBM,which Amdahl says is putting its salespeople under great pressure to losefewer orders - and higher manufacturing costs as it brings the 5990s on fullstream: chairman Jack Lewis said he didn't see gross margins going back tothe 48% of the first quarter of 1988 in the next couple of years, but thecompany later said it didn't expect them to go below the 45% of the firstquarter 1989;

Northern MartsandM;is to introduce an electronic auctioning system under which potential buyersbid via a computer terminal in their own homes or offices, rather thanattending a cattle market: while such a system may well reduce livestockhealth risks and stress, its scope for raising stress levels among farmersseems immense as it speeds the bidding process up to stock exchange timing;it also offers a challenge to all expert systems programmers, for can acomputer truthfully assess livestock form if it relies on information fromthe seller?
