Both companies were cautious in predicting what Iraq'saggression in the Persian Gulf would mean for oil prices. Ata news conference, BP's chairman, Robert Horton, said heexpected oil prices to remain &quot;on the north side&quot; of $20 to$22 a barrel over the next six months.</LP><TEXT>   North Sea oil prices were quoted yesterday at around $25 abarrel, up from an average of $16 in the second quarter.   BP said it didn't expect the Persian Gulf situation tocreate an immediate oil-supply crisis. The company estimatedthat increased output by other countries would make up forhalf the four million barrels a day lost from Iraq andKuwait.   Shell said the outlook for its results this year &quot;isobviously extremely uncertain and almost entirely dependenton how events in the Middle East unfold.&quot;   Royal Dutch/Shell's net income fell 43% to $940 millionfrom $1.64 billion a year earlier. On a current-cost basis,which strips out inventory gains or losses and is similar tothe accounting system used by U.S. oil companies, net fell16% to $1.24 billion from $1.49 billion.   Sales grew 6% to $27.86 billion from $26.17 billion.   In the first half, net fell 41% to $2.3 billion from $3.88billion a year earlier. On a current-cost basis, net fell 23%to $2.62 billion from $3.42 billion. Sales climbed 11% to$56.99 billion from $51.2 billion.   BP's net plummeted 94% to $74 million from $1.22 billion.The quarter included an extraordinary loss of $18 million,compared with a gain of $451 million a year earlier.Current-cost net slid to $478 million from $604 million.Sales rose to $12.2 billion from $12.01 billion.   In the first half, BP's net fell to $706 million from$2.29 billion. That included extraordinary gains of $43million in the latest half and $451 million a year before.Current-cost profit declined to $1.08 billion from $1.27billion. Sales grew to $25.54 billion from $23.45 billion.   Both companies were hurt by lower oil prices and reducedprofit margins on petrochemicals. Shell's results wereroughly in line with expectations, but BP's figures were wellbelow forecasts.   Stockbrokers said the market paid little attention to thefigures, focusing instead on action in the Persian Gulf andits effect on oil prices. &quot;That's really rendered everythingelse superfluous,&quot; said John Toalster, an analyst at HoareGovett in London.   In the second quarter, Shell's production of crude oilgrew 11% to 1.9 million barrels a day, but that was offset bythe drop in prices. The average price of North Sea Brentcrude was down 15% from a year earlier to $16.05 a barrel.   Operating profit from chemicals slumped to $257 millionfrom $435 million, reflecting a general drop in prices aftera boom in the late 1980s. Shell said that the &quot;downward trendin margins appears to have stabilized&quot; but that the companyremains cautious on the outlook for chemicals.   BP's operating profit from chemicals dropped to $65million from $305 million a year before. The company said theyearearlier results were exceptionally good and that plantmaintenance hurt performance in the latest quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
