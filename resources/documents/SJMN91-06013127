Schooley has refused to comply with a lawthat requires him to turn over to the state health department the names ofpatients who are taking part in work on experimental AIDS drugs.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AIDS RESEARCHER FIGHTS TO SHIELD SUBJECTSOF STUDY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Under Colorado law, physicians and other health-care providers must reportthe names of people who test positive for AIDS or the HIV virus to the healthdepartment. Failure to comply with the law is a petty offense punishable by upto a $300 fine.;    Schooley, chief of the infectious diseases department atthe University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, heads an AIDS  drugresearch program established as part of a nationwide network funded by theNational Institutes of Health.;    Launched in August, Schooley's study hasfewer than 50 patients. It focuses on experimental drugs that attack AIDS andmay impede the spread of the HIV virus that usually leads to AIDS. One of thedrugs is ddI, dideozyinsoine, an anti-viral  drug.;    Schooley maintains theparticipants have a right to confidentiality that could be breached if theirnames were logged into a state computer.;    &quot;Although the health departmentdoes a very good job of maintaining confidentiality, people say, 'Good grief,what if somebody gets those names? What effect could it have on me?' &quot;Schooley said.;    &quot;I don't think it's appropriate for names of individuals inresearch studies, just by virtue of being in a research study, to be subjectto being identified to the state. It's an issue of confidentiality of researchrecords.&quot;;    Colorado Department of Health officials say they need the namesto help them track the disease, find people who could be infected and stop itsspread.;    They note the state computer is self-contained -- not linked to atelephone line or a modem -- and is kept in a highly secure room.;    Inaddition, state law prevents health department employees  from disclosing thenames under penalty of a maximum $5,000 fine and up to 24 months in jail.;   The debate over whether the patient's rights to protect his identity shouldtake priority over the public health agency's right to information to helpcontrol AIDS' spread has smoldered for years.;    Schooley's actions couldwell bring it to a head.;    He has asked the NIH to seek a certificate ofconfidentiality from the Department of Health and Human Services to allow himto legally keep patients' names secret. The final decision will be made bySecretary Louis Sullivan, but officials were not sure when.;    Fred Wolf,director of the department's AIDS testing program, said the certificateprogram was launched in the 1970s to protect the identities ofdrug-and-alcohol abusers and mental health patients who wanted help but fearedrepercussions  from law enforcement agencies.;    Two dozen states requiresome kind of report on the identities of AIDS and HIV patients, Schooley said.Some of the states exempt research participants from the requirement, he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SANDY SHORE, Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Denver  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  525  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, January 13, 199100013127,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
