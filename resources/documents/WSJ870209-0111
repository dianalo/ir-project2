JacobsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PRESTREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><TEXT>   For a while, Precision Resources Inc. was flying high, telling the world that it had won government contracts totaling $200 million -- about 15 times its annual sales.    Then the repairer of military tanks and troop carriers learned it was all a lie. The company said there were no contracts.    The company said it was the victim of its own employee -- a vice president hired in September -- who wrote false records to show he was succeeding at getting the company more government work, the job for which he was hired.    The company declined to identify him other than to say he was in his 40s, and that when it recently checked his references they were found to be bogus. &quot;It was a long-term scheme to deceive the company,&quot; said Thomas H. O'Mara, chairman and chief executive officer.    But so far, at least, not a costly one. About the only money the Whippany, N.J., company committed to the bogus orders was to hire six or seven people in anticipation of more work, Mr. O'Mara said, adding that the real damage &quot;is to the reputation of the company.&quot;    Formerly called Van Dyk Research Corp., the company said it has a backlog of legitimate orders valued at $12.5 million. That is close to its sales in the fiscal year ended last June 30, when the concern earned $799,000, or 27 cents a share, on sales of $12.9 million.    Trading in the company's stock in the over-the-counter market was suspended Friday when the company announced the discovery of the scheme. Thursday the stock closed at $6 a share bid.    The phony orders began in the last three months of 1986, confirmed by written notices from the U.S. Treasury, Precision said. The bogus notices said the company had been named to buy, warehouse and ship goods for foreign governments. The company then announced the orders, which totaled about $200 million over three years.    But a $2.5 million deposit due on one order last month wasn't paid; a telex came saying the payment would be 45 days late, Mr. O'Mara said. Then the deceit was discovered when the company contacted the Treasury employee whose name appeared on the notices, and learned they were phony.    Apparently the new employee had faked all the papers. But Mr. O'Mara is at a loss to explain why. The man could get commissions only if the company received payment under the contracts. He did travel to Europe and the Middle East at the company's expense, but the trips &quot;were nothing elaborate,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said, adding that the employee was dismissed last week.    Treasury investigators have been called in, the executive said, adding &quot;It's a bizarre situation to say the least.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
