England, Ph.D., Divisionof Health Systems and Special Studies, Office of Research and Demonstrations,Room 2306 Oak Meadows Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland21207, telephone (301) 966-6630.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>HCFA proposes to initiate a new systemof records for data collected under the Arizona Health Care Cost ContainmentSystem (AHCCCS) demonstration project, which includes both acute care andthe Arizona Long Term Care System (ALTCS). (Both programs will be referredto as the AHCCCS program.) The AHCCCS program is conducted under the authorityof Section 1115 of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 gives the Secretaryauthority to waive certain requirements of Title XIX (Medicaid) for demonstrationprojects. The purpose of the proposed system of records is to acquire andmaintain data necessary to evaluate the AHCCCS project. The AHCCCS projectbegan in 1982 and in November, 1988 was granted a 5 year annually renewableextension through 1993.The AHCCCS concept involves payment of a capitated rate for acute and longterm care for indigent persons in Arizona, in lieu of a traditional Medicaidfee-for-service system. Because the AHCCCS program is capitated, Arizonadoes not receive claims data directly from Medicaid billings generatedby the program, as is the case with traditional fee-for-service programs.The proposed system of records will include encounter data collected byAHCCCS provider organizations, and beneficiary surveys conducted by theevaluator contracted by HCFA to evaluate the AHCCCS program. One objective of the AHCCCS demonstration project is preparation of a studycomparing the AHCCCS system with a traditional fee-for-service Medicaidsystem. In order to fulfill this objective and complete the tasks of thisproject, HCFA and the evaluation contractor must have individually-identifiedrecords. We are proposing to establish this system of records in accordancewith the requirements and principles of the Privacy Act. We do not anticipatethat establishment of the proposed system of records will have an unfavorableeffect on the privacy or other personal rights of individuals. The Privacy Act permits us to disclose individually identifiable informationwithout the consent of the individual under an exception for ``routineuses''. Under the ``routine uses'' exception, disclosure is permitted forpurposes that are compatible with the purpose for which HCFA collectedthe information. The proposed routine uses of the proposed system meetthe compatibility criteria because the information in the system is collectedfor evaluating the AHCCCS program, a demonstration program of the FederalGovernment. We anticipate that disclosures under the routine uses willnot result in any unwarranted adverse effects on personal privacy. In addition to the above, we are also changing the Retention and DisposalSection in the ``Evaluation of Medicare Competition Demonstrations,'' froman expiration date of December 31, 1988, to an expiration date of December31, 1993. This system, No. 09-70-0029, was last published at 48 FR 56645;December 22, 1983. This extension is needed to allow the data gatheredin the evaluation of the demonstrations to be used in conjunction withanother system of records, the ``Evaluation of the Tax Equity and FiscalResponsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)and Competitive Medical Plan (CMP) Program'' HHS/HCFA/ORD, No. 09-70-0038,last published at 53 FR 182; January 5, 1988.Dated: May 26, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="6">Louis B. Hays, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">09-70-0045 </ITAG>SYSTEM NAME: Evaluation of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment and Long Term CareSystems Demonstration. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: None. SYSTEM LOCATION: Contact system manager for location of contractor. See ``System Manager(s)and Address'' for system manager location. CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM: Persons residing in Arizona who qualify for medical assistance under theAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or the Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) programs, and a sample of persons in these programs in anotherstate(s) chosen for comparison with Arizona. CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM: Records in the system will contain information taken from the preadmissionscreening instrument, including beneficiary name, address, age, socialsecurity and Medicare numbers, demographic data, social worker assessment,available social supports and services, medical conditions, history andtreatments, and a cost-effectiveness analysis of proposed treatment. Thesystem will also include information on past encounters with AHCCCS facilities,visit types (inpatient or outpatient), the type of facility visited, andthe nature of the health resources utilized. During this project, approvalfor a beneficiary survey may be requested, in accordance with the PaperworkReduction Act and 5 CFR Part 1320. Data from such a survey would be includedin the proposed system of records. In additon, data from a previous beneficiarysurvey approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), ``Evaluationof Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System'', HCFA-386, OMB Number0938-0281, may be included in the proposed system of records. AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM: Section 1115 Waiver authority of Title XIX (Medicaid) requirements underwhich the AHCCCS program is operated. PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM: The primary objective of the AHCCCS demonstration is to assess the meritsof providing medical care to indigent persons on a capitated basis, comparedto a traditional fee-for-service system. This system of records will beused to study and evaluate the performance of the AHCCCS demonstration.ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIESOF USERS AND PURPOSES OF SUCH USERS: Disclosure may be made: 1. To contractor(s) for the purpose of collating, analyzing, aggregating,or otherwise refining or processing records in the system or for developing,modifying, and/or manipulating ADP software. Data would also be disclosedto contractors incidental to consultation, programming, operation, userassistance, or maintenance of an ADP or telecommunications system containingor supporting records in the system. 2. To a congressional office, from the record of an individual in responseto an inquiry from the congressional office made at the request of thatindividual. 3. To the Department of Justice, to a court or other tribunal, or to anotherparty before such tribunal, when: a. HHS, or any component thereof; or b.
