(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman celebrating her birthday with herhusband broke into hysteria after returning home to find that a firehad destroyed their wooden house, killing 10 people, including theirfour children.   Firefighters had to restrain Nancy Watson when she repeatedlytried to enter the burned-out two-story house, said Valerie Pound, awitness.   ``There was no house to get back into. It was just gone,'' Poundsaid. ``She kept screaming the names of her four kids in a pattern,one right after another.''   Three walls and the roof already had collapsed when firefightersarrived early Sunday, said Fire Chief Leo Renn.   The bodies of the badly burned victims were in or near their beds.   ``It's probably the worst situation I've seen where 10 people arekilled at one time,'' said Cass County Sheriff Jim Dawson. ``It'sjust devastating.''   Killed were John and Nancy Watson's children, Jenny, 14,Samantha, 11, Edward, 9, and William, 8; Mrs. Watson's sister andbrother-in-law, Jean and Becky Smischney; their two children, Jay,10, and Kimberly, 8; and Michelle Bastle, 10, and Robin Bastle, 12,daughters of Tony and Nancy Bastle, who live near the Watsons.   Elsewhere, New Year's weekend fires killed at least 23 people,including four in Charlotte, N.C., and four in Anchorage, Alaska,since Saturday.   Mrs. Watson was kept overnight for observation at Itasca MemorialHospital early today in the north-central Minnesota city of GrandRapids, 20 miles northeast of this town of 400 residents. She wasexpected to be released today, hospital officials said.   The fire spread so quickly it was unlikely anyone woke up beforebeing overcome by smoke, said Renn.   It was sparked by a wood-burning stove or an oil space heater,Renn said. He originally said the house was not equipped with smokedetectors, which were not required by law. But later, after arelative said there were indeed three smoke detectors in the house,Renn said, ``We may have to retract that.''   The fire was discovered by passing motorists, who stopped at thehouse of Melody Berczyk across the road from the Watson home. ``Itwas one big ball of flame right then,'' said Berczyk, who called thefire department.   A crisis intervention team was asked to come to the elementaryschool Tuesday to help the children deal with the deaths of theirclassmates. ``Hopefully, we'll just all pull together,'' saidPrincipal Mike Doro.   The Watsons had left the children with her sister andbrother-in-law, who were visiting from Bemidji, to celebrate Mrs.Watson's 32nd birthday on New Year's Eve.   Tammy Grover, a stepsister of John Watson, said the Watsonchildren loved the outdoors.   ``They had pet rabbits and geese and ducks,'' she said.   ``Jenny liked drawing and painting a lot, especially unicorns andhorses. She just won $75 in a contest at school, which was a reallybig thing to her,'' Grover said.   The Watsons, who are unemployed, ``were a poor family as far asmaterial things go, but they were a very close family,'' said Pound.   She said a fund has been set up for the victims' families at theSecurity State Bank in Remer.   ``In a small town, everyone is family,'' she said. ``This is byfar the most devastating thing that has ever happened to this town.   ``Everybody will pull together and help in any way you can. Eventhough it's not going to bring the kids back, the families will knowthat everyone in this town is hurt by what happened and is behindthem. This has touched everybody,'' Pound said.
