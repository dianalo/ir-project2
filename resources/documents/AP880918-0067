We are ready to speak withany government that respects human rights,'' said Louis Dejoie II,60-year-old leader of the national Agricultural Industrial Party,said by telephone from Puerto Rico.   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, who seized power in a palace coup fromLt. Gen. Henri Namphy, promised in his first public statement torespect civil liberties, human rights and said ``dialogue will behonored for the sake of national reconciliation.''   The statement was considered signficant because it echoed arecent offer for dialogue from opposition leader Marc Bazin, aconservative leader of the Committee for Democratic Understanding.   Bazin and Dejoie were among the four leading candidates forpresident in the Nov. 29 elections that were aborted by theindependent Electoral Council when armed thugs supported by thearmy attacked voters at the polls. The council was later abolishedby Namphy, who held new elections Jan. 17.   The leading candidates boycotted the second election, which waswon by Leslie Manigat, who was in office only four months whenNamphy ousted him in a bloodless coup.   ``In the next week or so, I expect them (the military) to saywhen elections will be held. They must do it or they won't have anysupport,'' Dejoie said.   Even Haiti's small Communist Party expressed pleasure with theturn of events.   ``This ... has come at the right moment to put an end to agovernment which was going to lead the country to an abyss ... Wegreet with satisfaction the first declaration of the newpresident,'' said Max Bourjolly, second in command of the party.   Another opposition politician, Hubert de Ronceray, runner-up toManigat in the military-controlled elections of Jan. 17, said,``All our difficulties come from the absence of dialogue. Dialogueis indispensable to the democratic process. Bazin has only revivedthe theme.''   A Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,predicted the new military government will maintain the oldcabinet, but propose an opening to civilians with a view toelections.   He also said other motives played a role in the coup.   ``The coup seems to have begun, as the coup against Manigat did,with the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the 1,000-manPresidential Guard,'' he said. ``Under Manigat, they felt slightedand felt their privileges threatened. Under Namphy, they did notreceive the material signs of recognition they expected, and on topof that, the atrocity last Sunday must have affected these men ofthe people ... (while) the High Command stood by.''   On Sept. 11, about 20 men armed with machetes, handguns andsteel pikes attacked a church during a Mass being said by the Rev.Bertrand Aristide, a militant opponent of the military government.Thirteen people were killed and 77 wounded. Namphy's government wasblamed by opponents for the violence.   The Presidential Guardsmen were the first military men topublicly condemn the government.   The diplomat speculated that the fact that Col. Jean-Claude Pauldid not intervene with his 700-man Dessalines Battalion indicatedhe was in favor of ousting Namphy.   ``Avril's margin of maneuver will be limited by the NCOs, whohave gotten a taste for power, having now overthrown twogovernments, one civilian, one military,'' he said.   There was at least one opponent of Namphy who was still notsatisfied with developments.   Sylvio Claude, leader of the Christian Democratic Party and oneof Haiti's most popular politicians, said in an interview on RadioSoleil Sunday, ``The coup was imminent, but the person who replacedNamphy is unacceptable. He was already rejected (by the people). Heis known as a Duvalierist and all Duvalierists are criminals.''</TEXT></DOC>
