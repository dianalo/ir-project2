Although both governments have expressed a desire to improvetheir chilly relations, the Japanese official said neither waswilling to compromise on a territorial dispute over several islandsin the southern Kurile chain held by the Soviets since the end ofthe war in 1945.   ``There were absolutely no new points of contact,'' said theofficial, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. He saidthe Soviet delegation called Soviet possession of the islands a``postwar reality,'' and urged Japan to ``assume a stance thatrecognizes the results of the war.''   Japan, however, renewed its claim to what it calls the``northern territories,'' a group of small islands off Hokkaido,Japan's northernmost main island.   The official said the Soviet delegation proposed the exchange ofdraft treaties, but that Japan refused because of ``reservationsregarding the validity of such drafts'' while the territorialdispute continues.   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev, head of the Sovietdelegation, was scheduled to continue talks with his Japanesecounterpart, Hisashi Owada, on a less formal level Tuesday, theofficial said.   Rogachev, completing a tour of five Asian nations, is scheduledto fly back to Moscow Wednesday.   The apparent failure of the talks comes less than two weeksafter Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, prompted by rapid changes inEastern Europe and the recent mood of East-West detente, called fora new era in bilateral relations.   Exchanges between the two nations have recently increased, andalong with a scheduled visit of Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze next March, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev isexpected to visit Japan in 1991. If he does, he will be the firstSoviet president to do so.   Foreign Ministry officials said their expectations for any newdevelopments were low going into the talks, but room for compromisehad been indicated earlier by Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev,a close adviser to Gorbachev who during a visit to Tokyo last monthspoke of a possibility of a ``third route'' toward improvedrelations.   However, no progress toward opening up a new path was made intoday's talks, the official said, adding that both countriescontinue to have a ``different approach.''   ``What the Japanese call the territorial problem, we call thedefinition of borders,'' he quoted a Soviet official as saying.   He said most of the seven-hour talks dealt with the Soviet claimto historical and legal jurisdiction over the islands, which theysay have belonged to Russia since the late 18th century and weredefined as Soviet territory by the Yalta Conference in 1945 and theSan Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951.   Japan disputes those claims, countering that the islands havebeen an integral part of its territory since ancient times. Tokyoalso claims a treaty signed in 1855 and a treaty ending theRusso-Japanese War in 1905 give Japan rightful ownership.</TEXT></DOC>
