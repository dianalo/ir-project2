This paperoffers some perspective on the progress which has been made, on someof the unresolved problems, and on the potential yet to be realized.These discussions address a variety of issues related to the developmentof nuclear data. Topics examined are: the importance of designing andconducting experiments so that error information is conveniently generated;the procedures for identifying error sources and quantifying their magnitudesand correlations; the combination of errors; the importance of consistentand well-characterized measurement standards; the role of covariancesin data parameterization (fitting); the estimation of covariances forvalues calculated from mathematical models; the identification of abnormalitiesin covariance matrices and the analysis of their consequences; the problemsencountered in representing covariance information in evaluated files;the role of covariances in the weighting of diverse data sets; the comparisonof various evaluations; the influence of primary-data covariance in theanalysis of covariances for derived quantities (sensitivity); and therole of covariances in the merging of the diverse nuclear data information.226 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
