L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drugand Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide thata patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patenteditem (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the itemwas marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period formsthe basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phaseand an approval phase. For human drug products, the testing phase beginswhen the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomeseffective and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phasestarts with the initial submission of an application to market the humandrug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drugproduct. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may counttoward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patentsand Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtractedas well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued),FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a humandrug product will include all of the testing phase and approval phase asspecified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).FDA has approved for marketing the human drug product Eulexin (flutamide)which is indicated for use in combination with luteinizing hormone releasinghormone (LHRH) agonistic analogues (such as leuprolide acetate) for thetreatment of metastatic prostatic carcinoma (state D<T2>2</T2>). To achieve the benefit of the adjunctive therapy with Eulexin,treatment must be started simultaneously using both drugs. Subsequent tothis approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received two alternativepatent term restoration applications for Eulexin from the Shering-PloughCorp. One was for U.S. Patent No. 4,472, 382 and the other covered U.S.Patent No. 4,329,364. The Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistancein determining the patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA,in a letter dated April 20, 1989, advised the Patent and Trademark Officethat the human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period andthat the active ingredient, flutamide, represented the first permittedcommercial marketing or use of the active ingredient. Shortly thereafter,the Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product'sregulatory review period.FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Eulexinis 6,359 days. Of this time, 3,317 days occurred during the testing phaseof the regulatory review period, while 3,042 days occurred during the approvalphase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:1. <T3>The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act became effective:</T3> September 2, 1971. FDA has verifiedthe applicant's claim that the investigational new drug application (IND)for Eulexin became effective on September 2, 1971. 2. <T3>The date the application was initially submitted with respect to thehuman drug product under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, andCosmetic Act:</T3> September 30, 1980. The applicant claims that the newdrug application (NDA) for Eulexin (NDA 18-554) was initially submittedon September 26, 1980. However, FDA records indicate that the applicationwas not received until September 30, 1980.3. <T3>The date the application was approved:</T3> January 27, 1989. FDA hasverified the applicant's claim that NDA 18-554 was approved on January27, 1989.This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximumpotential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of theactual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension,this applicant seeks 730 days of patent extension under U.S. Patent No.4,329,364 and requests 500 days of patent extension under U.S. Patent No.4,472,382, which constitutes the maximum allowable period of patent extensionunder that patent.Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may,on or before July 10, 1989, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (addressabove) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, anyinterested person may petition FDA, on or before November 7, 1989, fora determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted withdue diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden,the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation.(See H. Rept. 857, Part 1, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitionsshould be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch(address above) in three copies (except that individuals may submit singlecopies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in theheading of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the DocketsManagement Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stuart L.
