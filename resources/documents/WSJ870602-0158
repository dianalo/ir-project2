The food and chemical concern also disclosed it sold three of its businesses for $45 million.    By far the biggest of the acquisitions, Prince, a pasta and sauce producer in Lowell, Mass., is expected to post sales of $210 million this year, Borden said. Borden's Creamette brand pasta and 13 regional pasta brands the company produces were forecasted to generate $285 million of sales this year on their own, Borden said.    The other companies acquired are Blue Channel Inc., a Beaufort, S.C., crabmeat canner with annual sales of about $8 million; Steero Bouillon, a Jersey City, N.J., producer of instant and cubed bouillon, and DeJean Packing Inc., a shrimp canner in Biloxi, Miss., with yearly sales of about $5 million.    The operations sold are Polyco, of Cincinnati, a maker of polyvinyl acetate emulsions, and two overseas makers of toy models and hobby products, Heller, a French concern, and Humbrol, in England. The Polyco sale was announced earlier by Rohm andamp; Haas Co., which acquired the business. Altogether, the three divested operations would have accounted for about $50 million of Borden's estimated $6.4 billion of sales in 1987, Borden said.    Blue Channel, Steero Bouillon and DeJean Packing add to Borden's existing brands in canned seafood products and cubed and instant bouillon, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
