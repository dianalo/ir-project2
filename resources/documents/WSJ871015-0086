Andthis time it's on trade.   Financial markets took a dive yesterday, panicked by the latest trade-deficit figures. Washington officials took the latest report more calmly.    The turmoil was set off by the Commerce Department's report of a $15.68 billion deficit in U.S. merchandise trade in August. Although the deficit was narrower than the $16.47 billion gap in July, it exceeded the forecasts of many in the financial markets.    The financial markets' reaction: The dollar slipped in foreign-exchange dealings, short-term interest rates soared, bond prices plunged, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted in its second record one-day decline in eight days. The markets clearly fear that the Federal Reserve Board is preparing to increase its discount rate -- the rate that it charges on loans to member banks.    But in recent days, Federal Reserve officials have gone out of their way to suggest that such fears are misplaced. Both Chairman Alan Greenspan and Governor Robert Heller have said they see no signs of resurgent inflation. Yesterday Fed officials gave fresh indications that a discount rate increase isn't imminent.    And despite the strong market reaction yesterday, Fed policy makers insisted that the trade figures weren't a surprise. Excluding oil, imports were down substantially from the previous month, they note. And although the export dip in August was a disappointment, &quot;the general export trend is clearly up,&quot; one official said.    The investor panic triggered by the trade figures is ironic for another reason, government officials and private economists say. They consider the monthly merchandise figures, which aren't adjusted for inflation or seasonal variations, to be one of the least reliable indicators. &quot;It would be a serious mistake to believe these monthly numbers give a good view of the underlying trade picture,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. He and many economists in and out of government contend that rising export volumes are brightening the trade picture and buoying the economy.    Fed Chairman Greenspan said in a speech Tuesday that &quot;an extraordinary shift currently under way&quot; in the nation's trade balance is helping revive the nation's industrial sector. He conceded that the improvement isn't showing up in the monthly figures because higher import prices that have resulted from the dollar's decline continue to push up the nation's import bill.    However true that may be, the financial markets now react instantly to the monthly trade figures -- the same way they used to react to the money-supply figures, and, in an earlier era, to the consumer price index and the unemployment rate. Yesterday, the markets took one look at the trade figures, and the rout was on.    The Dow Jones average plunged 95.46 points in heavy trading to close at 2412.70. The drop, which worked out to 3.8%, eclipsed the prior record point decline of 91.55 points, or 3.47%, set Oct. 6. However, neither drop ranks among the 100 largest one-day percentage declines in the average.    Yesterday's sharp rise in short-term interest rates, which included a hefty quarter-point spurt on the usually stable prices of three-month Treasury bills, prompted Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., to predict that the Fed may well raise the discount rate as early as tomorrow. The Fed last raised the discount rate just before Labor Day, by half a percentage point to 6%.    In the bond market, prices of several widely traded Treasury issues plunged more than two points, or $20 per $1,000 of face amount. As a result, the yield of the latest 30-year Treasury, a bond-market bellwether, soared above 10%.    And in foreign-exchange trading, the dollar immediately slipped more than a pfennig against the West German mark on the trade announcement and more than a yen against the Japanese currency. The dollar ended at its lowest levels against both currencies since early in September.    To understand yesterday's savage market reaction, the trade news must be viewed against the backdrop of other Wall Street worries, market observers say. The slide of more than 300 points in the Dow industrial average since its Aug. 25 record of 2722.42 has both resulted from and combined with fears of a new interest-rate spiral. Sharply higher interest rates could derail the economic boom and spark a recession as early as the second half of next year.    Mitchell J. Held, a money and credit analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said late last week that his reading of recent moves by the West German central bank and Fed Chairman Greenspan suggests that &quot;a coordinated, or semicoordinated, tightening of monetary policies {among the world's major trading partners} could take place within the next few weeks.&quot;    Moreover, some in the markets believe that America's U.S. trading partners/creditors at last month's meetings in Washington -- particularly Japan and Germany -- quietly put their foot down and wrung major, long-term commitments from the American government to defend the dollar through higher interest rates, even if it forces a recession here.    But Fed policy makers paint a quite different picture. They say the discount-rate increase in September was largely a response to the bond market's fears of inflation. A key indicator of those inflation fears, these officials argue, is the steepness of the &quot;yield curve&quot; -- the degree to which long-term bond rates exceed short-term rates. Yesterday, however, short-term rates rose faster than long-term rates, and the yield curve flattened. So, the officials say, they see no need to tighten credit further.    And, in fact, there are indications that the Fed hasn't tightened credit further this month. Looking back at September, some market analysts recently detected signs of a tighter policy in the Fed's open-market operations and in the rise of the Fed funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to one another. Technical factors -- including the surge of Treasury receipts at the end of the federal fiscal year Sept. 30 -- probably masked the full extent of the Fed's tightening last month.    An administration official said investors might take the view that the trade numbers presage higher interest rates, but he said, &quot;That view is unjustified.&quot;    The administration's top trade official, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, conceded that &quot;so far, the key trading countries have not yet made sufficient progress in correcting the imbalances&quot; that underlie the trade problem, &quot;and the market perceives this.&quot; But he added that if trade volume figures continue to improve, &quot;it'll be simply a matter of time before the nominal {actual dollar} figures turn around.&quot; He said the next set of volume figures to be watched closely will be those due out next week as part of the report on third-quarter gross national product.    Mr. Yeutter discouraged speculation that the dollar must go lower to right the trade balance. &quot;Exchange rates can only do so much,&quot; he declared. &quot;Our problem today is not one of price competitiveness. Adjusting exchange rates has no effect on trade flows where the determining factors are quality, service and other things besides price. That is our challenge today.&quot;    But if the trade deficit remains stubbornly high, something will have to give: Either the dollar will have to fall further to make U.S. products more competitive in world markets or interest rates will have to rise to attract foreign capital. The administration saw yesterday's market reaction as largely tied to interest-rate fears rather than expectations of a lower dollar.    Treasury Secretary James Baker and other administration economic officials are bound to be questioned on all these topics this afternoon at a previously scheduled economic policy press briefing, following a meeting with President Reagan. Officials said the press session was scheduled at White House request several days ago to highlight trends in the economy, and wasn't a reaction to yesterday's market plunge.    Democrats used the report to blast the Reagan administration's trade policy. Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, campaigning in Iowa, released a statement saying, &quot;Until we have an administration that fights for open markets overseas, American exports of manufactured goods and farm products will continue to fall, and the heartland of this country will continue to be left behind.&quot;    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd said he is troubled by the export drop. &quot;As the U.S. plunged from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor, there has been no sense of administration concern, no sense of urgency,&quot; the West Virginia Democrat complained.    In inflation-adjusted terms, the trade deficit in goods and services narrowed in the 1986 fourth quarter and the 1987 first half. The Commerce Department's initial estimate of third-quarter growth, due next Friday, is expected to show a narrowing for that quarter, too.    In addition, economists contend that the trade balance typically deteriorates in July and August; so, the figures might look much better after seasonal adjustment. &quot;This isn't a good number,&quot; said Donald Straszheim, president of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. But he added, &quot;We remain confident that for the forseeable future our export volumes will continue to grow at a fairly healthy pace.&quot;    Last month, according to the Commerce Department's August figures, the trade deficit shrank against each of the countries with which the U.S. ran the largest deficits last year -- Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong. The deficit with Japan -- $4.88 billion, down from $5.07 billion in July -- was the lowest in the past six months.    Also, the overall deficit in manufactured goods narrowed to $13.28 billion from $14.47 billion in July. That improvement was entirely due to lower imports; manufactured exports fell for the third consecutive month.    The report showed that the dollar value of exports fell 3.7%, while the value of imports dropped 4.2%. The drop in exports followed a 0.6% decline in July. In addition to the seasonal factors, Mr. Jasinowski said the decline included a big drop in aircrafts and parts, a category that varies widely from month to month. Moreover, he and other analysts cited recent gains in industrial employment and production as indications that U.S. companies are increasing shipments overseas.    The import decline, which followed a 1.8% rise in July, might have been even sharper if oil imports had been at more normal levels, analysts said. July and August oil imports reflected temporary inventory building in anticipation of price increases and supply disruptions in the Persian Gulf.    At the same time, the import total probably was reduced by the unrest in South Korea. The trade deficit with Korea narrowed to $902.5 million from $1.14 billion in July.    Mr. Jasinowski said that notwithstanding the unusual factors, the August decline suggests that &quot;U.S. consumers are beginning to substitute domestic for foreign products.&quot;    Still, economists in and out of government had expected the dollar's decline to have brought the merchandise deficit to much less than $15.68 billion by now, and the August report was widely viewed as a negative indicator. Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said the figures suggest that &quot;the improvement in the trade balance that was occurring even in nominal terms seems to have stalled. That is an unsatisfactory situation.&quot;    Mr. Straszheim cited U.S. deficits with Taiwan and Korea, which he said have been deteriorating this year despite improvement in August. &quot;We're making progress against the Japanese but losing ground against Taiwan and Korea,&quot; he said.    Exports in August fell to $20.22 billion from $21.01 billion in July. Manufactured exports fell to $13.67 billion from $13.87 billion.    Overall, imports dropped to $35.91 billion from $37.48 billion, with manufactured imports falling to $26.95 billion from $28.34 billion. The value of imports of petroleum and related products rose 1.1% to $4.7 billion after increasing 15.7% to $4.65 billion in July.    ---                      Largest Drops of DJIA    Date                Close      Decline    % Chg    Oct. 14, 1987          2412.70      95.46     -3.81%    Oct. 6, 1987           2548.63      91.55     -3.47    Sept. 11, 1986         1792.89      86.61     -4.61    July 7, 1986           1839.00      61.87     -3.25    Mar. 30, 1987          2278.41      57.39     -2.46    May 15, 1987           2272.52      52.97     -2.28    Sept. 1, 1987          2610.97      51.98     -1.95    April 13, 1987         2287.07      51.71     -2.21    April 22, 1987         2285.94      51.13     -2.19    Sept. 15, 1987         2566.58      46.46     -1.78   ---                U.S. Merchandise Trade Balance                (In billions of U.S. dollars)                            AUG.
