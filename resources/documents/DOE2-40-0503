Calculations were performed withthe BWR Severe Accident Response (BWRSAR) code and are based upon considerationof the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station. The modeling strategies employedwithin BWRSAR for debris relocation within the reactor vessel are brieflydiscussed and the calculated events of the accident sequence, includingdetails of the calculated debris pours, are presented. 4 refs., 13 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
