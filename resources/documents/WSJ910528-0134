By converting, Sandamp;Ls rid themselves of higher regulatoryfees, avoid a rule ordering that home mortgages comprise 70%of their assets, and shed what some believe is an unsavoryimage following the taxpayer bailout of the Sandamp;L insurancefund.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's just no reason to want to be a thrift any more,&quot;says Patrick Forte of the Association of Financial ServicesHolding Companies.   Just last week, the Office of Thrift Supervision grantedapproval to a first wave of 11 Sandamp;Ls that wanted to abandontheir federal thrift charters and become savings banks,chartered by their states. They were the first approvalssince the thrift regulators started raising objections tocharter flips last fall.   Six additional applications are pending, and many more areanticipated. &quot;My sense is now that these have been approved,there's going to be a great deal more interest on the part ofother institutions,&quot; said Alan Kaplinsky, of the Philadelphialaw firm of Wolf, Block, Schorr andamp; Solis-Cohen, whorepresented four of the switching thrifts. Other Sandamp;Ls, hesaid, have expressed interest but were wary of undertakingthe lengthy, expensive process if government regulators werehostile to the idea.   Previously, thrift regulators fought the requests,contending that the Sandamp;Ls were simply trying to sidestepfederal rules that barred Sandamp;Ls from risky investments. Now,in private interviews and public speeches, Timothy Ryan,director of the thrift office, proclaims that financialinstitutions should choose whichever charter makes sense.   &quot;He's been talking to industry people, other experts, thatlead him to believe that there shouldn't be artificial,archaic barriers that don't make economic sense,&quot; a spokesmanfor Mr. Ryan said.   Many of the previous advantages of a thrift charter werewiped out in the Sandamp;L cleanup law. For example, thrifts arerequired to be members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System.Once they reaped hefty dividends on the stock they held inthe bank system, but now those dividends have been curtailedbecause a portion goes to the Sandamp;L bailout costs.   &quot;They're forcing us to do things our competitors don'thave to do,&quot; says Charles Koch, president and chief executiveof First Federal Savings Bank, Cleveland, a unit of CharterOne Financial Inc. He wants First Federal, with $3 billion inassets, to switch charters, but so far he can't even applybecause Ohio has no state charter for savings banks. The OhioLegislature may take up the issue in the fall, he said.   The sweeping banking-overhaul legislation currently movingthrough Congress is likely to address how Sandamp;Ls may switch tobank charters. One amendment approved in a House subcommitteelast week would permit buyers of failing thrifts to convertthem to national banks.   But the amendment, sponsored by Rep. Chalmers Wylie (R.,Ohio), would allow the new banks to own other financialaffiliates without restriction. Congressional aides andlobbyists say they expect the amendment language to berevised.   Another amendment is expected to be introduced by Rep.Doug Barnard (D., Ga.). Current rules require Sandamp;Ls to countreserves for bad Sandamp;L debts as income if they switch to a bankcharter. The Barnard amendment would shield them from the taxpenalty, but would require them to continue home-mortgagelending.</TEXT></DOC>
