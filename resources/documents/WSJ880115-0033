The sources said Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, a family trust, was expected to deliver a formal proposal last night to state and city agencies.    The proposal envisions that the Kennedys would build the mart as a major anchor to the project, which also will include four big office towers, renovated theaters, a hotel and shopping.    Under the proposal, Chemical Bank would lease 800,000 square feet, roughly a third of the mart, and the rest would be devoted to wholesale showrooms for apparel, gifts, furnishings and other items. In addition, Chemical, a unit of Chemical New York Corp., is considering moving its headquarters to one of the four office buildings.    The 42nd St. Development Project -- an attempt to revitalize one of New York's most famous and dilapidated streets -- is one of the biggest renewal efforts ever. However, the project has been delayed for years by lawsuits and critics, and its political backing has wavered.    The addition of the Kennedys, as well as Chemical, would give it powerful allies. &quot;The Kennedys bring a unique dynamic to it,&quot; one person involved in the project said. &quot;It's moving again.&quot; The Kennedys already own merchandise marts in Chicago and in Washington.    Sources said the Kennedy proposal was delayed by the stock-market crash, which weakened the city's real-estate market. However, the office buildings, which will be built by closely held Park Tower Realty Corp. and Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America, have major, long-term tax advantages. Real-estate executives said that even in a weakened market, Park Tower buildings should be able lure tenants from other buildings by charging lower rents.    With the Kennedys on board, it also is expected that a hotel-development team, including closely held Silverstein Properties Inc., will be announced soon. Trade-mart shows generate big hotel traffic. &quot;The hotel is a winner if the mart is there,&quot; one source said.    The project still faces hurdles. The mart can't break ground until the State Urban Development Corp. and the Kennedys sign an agreement. In addition, the state agency, which is sponsoring the project, has to go through condemnation proceedings to acquire the 13-acre site and turn over pieces to various developers.    A spokesman for the agency said all the parties involved had agreed not to comment for the time being.    Critics said the subsidized, $2.5 billion project is no longer needed. They note that the Times Square area has been slowly improving because of market forces. In addition, landowners in the area are expected to fight condemnation. </TEXT></DOC>
