Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/24/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee approved aDemocratic anti-crime bill that would impose a seven-daywaiting period for handgun purchases.   The legislation, passed on a 23-11 vote, could reach theHouse floor for a vote as soon as two weeks from now,Democrats said.</LP><TEXT>   The Bush administration until recently had opposed thebill as ineffective and a burden on law-abiding gun owners.But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last week said PresidentBush might sign the legislation if it were part of a broaderpackage of anti-crime provisions, including an expandedfederal death penalty and curbs on the appeal rights ofdeath-row inmates. At least for now, Democrats want to passthe bill separately and force the president to make adecision about whether to sign it.   Supporters praised the so-called Brady Bill, named forformer White House spokesman James Brady, as a milestone inthe nation's fierce gun-control debate. &quot;I believe Congressis on the verge of transforming public opinion into publicpolicy,&quot; said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), chairman ofthe House crime subcommittee. Mr. Brady was severely woundedwhen he was shot in the 1981 attempt to assassinate PresidentReagan, who was also wounded in the attack.   Mr. Reagan's own recent endorsement of a waiting period,which he had previously opposed, has prompted proponents topredict that Congress will enact the legislation this year.The bill was defeated in the House three years ago. SeventeenDemocrats, joined by six Republicans, voted for the measureyesterday.   &quot;Today's vote sends a strong, clear message to the NRA&quot;(National Rifle Association), said Rep. Edward Feighan (D.,Ohio), the Brady Bill's original sponsor. &quot;The era ofintimidation is over.&quot;   The influential NRA has lobbied hard against the BradyBill. The association and the White House have supported analternative measure that would require instantaneous computerchecks of gun purchasers. Brady Bill supporters branded thealternative bill impractical and designed only to underminethe waiting-period measure.</TEXT></DOC>
