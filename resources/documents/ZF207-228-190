 The Macintosh community was small and truly acommunity.andP;  People planned their calendars around Expos and made pilgrimagesto San Francisco and Boston to share their enthusiasm for the Macintosh withother true believers.andP;  The show floors were like Persian bazaars: row afterrow of tiny booths with strange and interesting things to show and barter.andO;Macophiles wandered the aisles in jeans and T-shirts in a state of perpetualexcitement and passed freeware and shareware from hand to hand like bottlesof apple wine.andP;  People in suits felt out of place.andM;But time and tide wait for no man, and over the years the Macintosh tide hasdefinitely turned toward business.andP;  The Macintosh community, once a smallneighborhood, has burgeoned into a vast melting pot in which the originalenthusiasts have become just a small subgroup among the business users,desktop publishers, and other new converts.andM;The Macintosh market is now large and diverse, and the shows just aren't funanymore.andP;  They're too big, too sprawling, too crowded -- and there are toomany of them.andP;  The &quot;general audience&quot; Macworld Expos added a third locationthis year, and the two Comdex shows have sprouted concurrent Macintosh-onlyshows like second heads.andP;  Then there are the more targeted shows such as theMacintosh Business Conference andamp; Exposition (three locations), although theyare smaller and less heavily attended and easier to get something out of (sofar).andM;I used to really look forward to attending these shows.andP;  But as the showshave grown, the fun has shrunk, to the point where I didn't bother to attendthe Boston Expo last year, and people who did attend told me how lucky I wasto have missed it.andP;  This year I went to the San Francisco Expo in January andwas overwhelmed by the size of the show, spread over two locations.andP;  An extra&quot;industry&quot; day has been tacked onto the beginning of the last few Expos, butthis year the crowds on industry day were as bad as they were on thegeneral-public days last year.andM;There were actually some high points at the January Expo, such as Apple'sintroduction of the Mac SE/30.andP;  It's an interesting machine, returning as itdoes to power with a small footprint, but it wasn't the laptop, so peopleyawned.andP;  Silicon Beach announced SuperCard, which blends artistry withHyperCard programming and expands on it with elements such as color andvarying card sizes.andP;  No one yawned at this one, but it wasn't ready to shipyet.andM;One of the few really exciting products at the Expo came out of one of thosesmall booths that were few and far between and hearkened back to the earlydays of Macintosh enthusiasm.andP;  The WristMac, a Seiko watch with a cable forconnecting to a Mac and a HyperCard interface program, thrilled and delightedthe crowds.andP;  Although it's hardly a Mac on a wrist, it does allow you todownload 80 &quot;screens&quot; of two 12-character lines (especially handy fortelephone numbers) and program in alarms with memos.andP;  It even interfaces withprograms such as Focal Point II, so you can download reminders.andP;  One of thereasons this product seemed reminiscent of the old days was that the wholeproject was undertaken by a bunch of old-line Macintosh enthusiasts who hadall met via CompuServe's MAUG forums.andM;Many smaller gems were to be found among the teeming hordes.andP;  Projectmanagers got a preview of MicroPlanner X-Pert, coming in late summer, whichbuilds on MicroPlanner and adds dozens of improvements and enhancements,ranging from a report writer for designing custom reports to aminute-by-minute scheduler.andM;Telecommunicators who made the trek to Brooks Hall from the MosconeConvention Center saw a preview of CompuServe Navigator 3.0, which takesadvantage of CompuServe's new Host-Micro Interface.andP;  Back on the main floorin Moscone, Hayes was showing version 3.1 of Smartcom II, which addson-screen macro buttons and automatic script generation, and SoftwareVentures was previewing Micro-Phone II 3.0, an enhanced version of thatpopular communications program.andM;As the show floor gets more crowded and spreads over more locations, somecompanies are focusing more on hospitality suites, where they can show theirwares to industry insiders away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds.andO;Farallon had such a suite right in Moscone, where it was showing its entireline, including the incredible Screen Recorder (a product you mustinvestigate if you're involved in training), as well as previewing a new&quot;groupware&quot; program for shared editing and commenting on any document.andO;Layered had a suite in a nearby hotel, where it demonstrated its newmiddle-range accounting program, AtOnce, which should be a real winner in anuncrowded category.andP;  The new version of Layered's high-end system, Insight,which now features full import/export capability, allows sophisticatedfront-end systems to be developed with databases such as 4th Dimension.andM;Finding these significant new products amid the chaos and hoopla was noteasy, even though I had been inundated with press releases, productliterature, and invitations in the weeks before the show and had theadvantage of being able to do some prescreening.andP;  For the average Macintoshuser walking in off the street, the show must have been overwhelming.andP;  It wasjust too big, too sprawling, and too crowded (not to mention the brilliantstroke of scheduling the show to end on Super Bowl Sunday in what was tobecome the winning city, which made gridlock a certainty that night).andM;PINSTRIPE PICKSandM;Some other products seen at the Expo (in those smaller booths) that you maywant to investigate if you use your Macintosh for business:andM;Acta Advantage (Symmetry).andP;  The popular outlining desk accessory now comeswith an application version as well (great for those MultiFinderenvironments).andM;INITPicker (Microseeds).andP;  A simple Control Panel device that lets you pickand choose which INIT programs you want to run at startup.andP;  Excellent forproblem determination.andM;OnCue (ICOM).andP;  Install your most frequently used programs and documents in analways-available menu for quick access.andP;  Works well with MultiFinder.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
