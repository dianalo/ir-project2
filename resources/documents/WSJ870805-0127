The toll on Iranian and Iraqi youth has been hideous, but the early fears of world-wide impact have not been realized. Oil continued to pass through the Persian Gulf. Shiite fundamentalism did not fire the Arab world. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were able to find a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with the belligerents. The Soviet Union pocketed its arms-sale revenues, but found no obvious opportunities for meddling in the turmoil.    Now suddenly the war dominates the news. Iranian pilgrims riot in Mecca, and Iran declares an objective of removing the Saudi royal family. The price of oil is soaring. The U.S. Navy, after its first ward hits a mine, congratulates itself on escorting a &quot;reflagged&quot; Kuwaiti tanker through the gulf. Kuwait refuses to provide bases for mine-sweeping helicopters protecting its shipping. Whether from honest doubt about the operation or congenital cowardice, the European allies won't help, except France, embroiled in its own dispute with Iran.    Iranian rhetoric focuses with new venom on the United States, even blaming America for deaths during the riots in the Islamic holy city. Ugly rumors are spread that both President Reagan and French Prime Minister Chirac asked the Iranians not to release hostages before American and French elections. In the midst of this, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov visits Tehran. According to the official Iranian news agency, he wound up his trip by condemning the &quot;governments&quot; responsible for the deaths of pilgrims, adding, &quot;The global role of Iran and the Soviet Union warrants further cooperation between the two countries.&quot;    These are the early returns, it seems to us, from the U.S. tilt toward Iraq. When Iraqi planes attacked an American warship, the American response was to send ships to fight the Iranians. The ayatollahs, known for their odd view of the world, somehow took offense. Instead of flying sorties against the escorts, they planted mines, played the Saudi card and cozied up to the Russians. A saner response would be finally to accept Iraqi offers to negotiate an end to the bloodletting, of course, but the U.S. again seems to have underestimated the Iranian regime.    Which leads us again to the question: Just what is the U.S. trying to accomplish in the gulf? It would of course be nice to end the attacks on tankers by both sides. The Iraqi attacks are aimed at stemming Iranian oil exports and revenues, and the Iranian attacks are in retaliation. If Iraq stops, perhaps because it is convinced it has alternative ground targets, Iran probably would follow if not put in the position of backing down.    It would also be nice to bolster the Kuwaitis, especially since the Russians have been making their own overtures. But this scarcely seems an overwhelming objective when Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah gives news conferences to wash his hands. &quot;These are American ships now,&quot; he said. Kuwait is &quot;not ready&quot; for bases, though after awhile it might let the escort warships enter Kuwaiti territorial waters to take on fuel or food. In response to this rebuff, the U.S. sends an aircraft carrier for the helicopters.    These limited purposes didn't require reflagging with maximum publicity in the wake of the missile attack on the USS Stark. The ayatollahs read this spin as a tilt toward Iraq because it was a tilt toward Iraq. Strange fellows that they are, they may also have some trouble understanding why the U.S. wants to tilt toward the Saddam Hussein regime, which not only attacked the Stark but started the war, started the tanker attacks, holds a friendship treaty with the Soviets, uses primarily Russian arms and is scarcely innocent of terrorism. (Though taken off the State Department's terrorist-nation list in 1982, it has been home for Abu Abbas, who hijacked the Achille Lauro in 1985, for example.)    The explanation for the tilt toward Iraq seems to lie with George Shultz and Caspar Weinberger. The State Department agenda is negotiation, as always, and it wants to exert some &quot;pressure&quot; to get Ayatollah Khomeini to the table. The secretary of defense has just been on television explaining his personal anti-Iranian convictions. His strategic view of the gulf seems to start, and pretty much end, with the notion that no one in Iran could possibly be a &quot;moderate,&quot; presumably including army officers trained at such places as Fort Benning. Having swept aside bureaucratic opponents in the Iran-Contra affair, the two former Bechtel executives now stand unchallenged.    Too bad there's not someone to keep demanding, what are the U.S. interests in the gulf? In such a list, the top two items would be avoiding a Soviet takeover of Iran, which dominates the area geopolitically, and avoiding a sudden interruption of the flow of oil. This was once understood in the National Security Council, but of course, such thinking led the nation into error and disaster. </TEXT></DOC>
