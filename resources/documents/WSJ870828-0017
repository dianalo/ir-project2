In two of the tries at the crucial test, the countdown was stopped within 15 seconds of ignition. A fourth attempt of the test wasn't expected until tomorrow.    The failure to conduct the test -- regarded as a major hurdle for the space shuttle program -- was a setback for Morton Thiokol officials and appeared to underscore the difficulties of obtaining reliability in space technology. When the countdown was cut short the third and final time, there was an audible groan from the spectators on the scene. Morton Thiokol officials shook their heads.    The object of the test -- the main element of the redesigned shuttle booster rocket, especially the joints holding the rocket segments together -- apparently wasn't at fault on any of the occasions. Nevertheless, test officials were clearly dismayed that the countdown hadn't gone smoothly. It was also another dose of bad news for the nation's space program. &quot;We're obviously disappointed,&quot; said one Thiokol executive. The company had been at work on the redesigned engine for nearly 20 months and had prepared long in advance for the test.    Company officials said the first countdown was stopped because of a malfunction in a water system designed to cool the rocket after the firing. On the second occasion, computer systems weren't synchronized properly. The third time, an auxiliary power unit that controls the rocket motor nozzles failed to pressurize properly nine seconds before iginition. The last problem was one that would have forced the scrubbing of an actual space shuttle launch.    U.E. Garrison, president of Morton Thiokol's aerospace division, said, &quot;It's a very complicated test. Literally hundreds of things have to operate properly.&quot;    Space industry officials regard the scheduled test as a critical one for the space shuttle program. A failure in the test most likely would force the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to postpone its goal of a June 1988 launch. It also could severely damage the company's efforts to remain the major supplier of the shuttle boosters.    It was also hoped that the test would be a boost to the sagging morale of Morton Thiokol employees. Instead, it may have had just the opposite effect.    The test is the first attempted firing of the redesigned shuttle engine with a full load of propellant. The main feature of the new engine -- changed because of last year's explosion of the space shuttle Challenger -- are new joints that connect the four sections of the rocket. A presidential commission concluded that cold temperature on the day of the Challenger launch in January 1986 caused two O-rings in one of the joints to contract, allowing hot gases to escape and ignite the shuttle's liquid fuel tank.    Thousands of spectators focused on the 1.2 million-pound rocket, mounted on a horizontal test stand in a barren mountain setting here. During the first countdown, a test official announced the proceedings over a loudspeaker. Just after reaching 15 seconds, the official said &quot;abort motor . . . emergency . . . shutdown.&quot;    NASA and Thiokol officials immediately exited from a special viewing platform and disappeared from sight.    The officials later returned to say that a hose had broken in the cooling system. Following the malfunction, however, there appeared to be considerable confusion about when the test might be restarted and the schedule was repeatedly changed.    The test was attempted again two hours later, but stopped early in the countdown because of the computer problems. The third attempt occurred late in the day and appeared to frustrate company officials the most. The culprit in the final attempt was a power unit -- formerly called a thrust-vector control -- supplied by United Space Boosters Inc.    Morton Thiokol officials sought to play down the significance of the aborted tests, by calling it &quot;disappointing, but not unusual.&quot; Said Mr. Garrison: &quot;We're not really panicked to get the test off.&quot;    NASA officials also shook off questions about whether or not test officials had succumbed to the same sort of pressure that led to the misstaken decision to launch the Challenger in cold weather. Adm. Richard Truly, the highest-ranking NASA official present at the test, said there was &quot;no pressure to get the test off today.&quot;    He added, however, that he was &quot;frustrated&quot; by the day's events.    The aborted tests are bound to lead to renewed debate about the ultimate reliability of modern space technology. Earlier this week, a solid-fuel rocket being developed by Morton Thiokol for the Delta launch vehicle flew along the ground after a motor failed during at test firing in Huntsville, Ala., according to wire service reports.    Yesterday's scheduled firing was the first of several full-scale tests planned for the 126-foot-long rocket. During the test, solid fuel in the rocket was to burn for almost two minutes.    Officials estimated the cost of the test at $15 million. The budget for the redesign program is $460 million. As part of a settlement with NASA, the company agreed to do the redesign work at cost.    Company officials described the redesigned rocket as a &quot;quantum jump&quot; over the previous model. They said this particular test wouldn't fully determine if the new design is adequate. Among other things, they said it wouldn't be capable of determining how the new joints would be affected by gravitational forces that build up in an actual launch, the pressure and temperature changes that take place as the shuttle rises, or how the motor would react when attached to the actual shuttle, with its large external fuel tank. </TEXT></DOC>
