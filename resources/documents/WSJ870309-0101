A spokesman for the St. Louis-based aircraft maker confirmed yesterday that there have been &quot;some informal conversations&quot; with the European aircraft consortium &quot;in recent weeks.&quot; Airbus declined to comment yesterday.    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus had serious discussions for several months last year about cooperating on a long-range aircraft to compete with market leader Boeing Co.'s 747. Talks broke off in September when it became clear that both sides were committed to launching their own projects -- McDonnell Douglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.    Since then, McDonnell Douglas has gone ahead with the MD-11 program and has attracted more than 100 orders and options for the 260-seat long-range jumbo jet. And Airbus hopes to get the necessary airline orders and government funding so it can proceed with its program for the long-range A340 and the related, shorter-range A330 this spring.    Despite this head-to-head competition, McDonnell Douglas revived the talks recently because &quot;we can work together on things that don't conflict,&quot; the spokesman said. Theoretically, he added, the two companies could team up to build Airbus's proposed A330, a derivative of Airbus's 150-seat, short-range A320, and even a stretched version of the MD-11.    Airbus and McDonnell Douglas &quot;are in the early stages of talking to each other again,&quot; the McDonnell Douglas spokesman said. &quot;Several people on both sides have been involved. We have never stopped believing that collaboration is the most sensible way to go.&quot;    Given the enormous outlays necessary to develop new aircraft, collaboration is becoming more common in the industry. Airbus itself is a collaboration between Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.)H of West Germany, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    The MD-11 is expected to cost McDonnell Douglas some $700 million to develop. Airbus's A330 and A340, which would share a common wing and cockpit and a similar fuselage, are expected to cost at least $2.5 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
