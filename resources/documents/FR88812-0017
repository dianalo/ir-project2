The proposed exemption would apply to sales in subdivisions(as that term is defined by the Act) of 100 or more lots that are createdby the continual acquisition and disposal of lots in geographically scatteredlocations which, unless extraordinary steps are taken, are offered underone common promotional plan and are, therefore, subject to registration.However, because of the very nature of these types of operations with aconstantly revolving inventory of lots in scattered and diverse parts ofthe country, registration is impractical from both the registrant's andthe registering agency's standpoint.The proposed exemption will allow developers of these subdivisions to operatewithout the necessity of taking the steps necessary to avoid operatingunder one common promotional plan and maintaining a registration. Promulgationof this exemption will not decrease the consumer protections provided bythe Act but, rather, will provide information formerly not made availableto prospective purchasers by developers of these types of subdivisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2><T3>Comment Due Date:</T3> October 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit comments regardingthis rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Room10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20410.

Individual sites contain fewer than 100 lotsbut are ineligible for the 100-lot exemption (24 CFR 1710.6) since, whentwo or more of the sites are offered under a single common promotionalplan, the offering exceeds 100 lots and is subject to registration. Likewise,these multiple site offerings are ineligible for the scattered site exemption(24 CFR 1710.8) since, invariably, one or more of the sites will exceedthe 20 lot-per-site limitation. Therefore, since these multiple site subdivisionsare offered and sold under a single common promotional plan, all such multiplesite offerings must either be registered or qualify for one of the availableexemptions from registration. Typically, these sites are created from abandonedfarms, undeveloped parcels in remote locations and similar vacant land.In an overwhelming majority of cases the developers of these multiple sitesubdivisions offer no facilities or amenities but rather, sell the landon an ``as is'' basis.To avoid the difficulties of a multiplicity of registrations and the nearimpossibility of a single registration, these developers must structuretheir offerings so that eligibility for the 24 CFR 1710.6 exemption isattainable. To accomplish this eligibility, the multiple sites are groupedso that the total number of lots is fewer than 100 and the correspondingpromotion and sales activity is limited to that combination of multiplesites, totally isolated from any other site or any other multiple sitecombination(s) which the developer owns or acquires in the future. In otherwords, these developers must create and maintain separate subdivisionsof fewer than 100 lots each and strictly adhere to the principles of separability;i.e., no common advertising, name, telephone number, address or sales forceand, probably the most difficult of all, no cross-referrals. In order tomaintain the necessary separability, the only acceptable element of commonalityis ownership.The proposed rule will provide relief from the registration requirementsplaced upon developers of these types of operations by creating the ``MultipleSite Subdivision Exemption''. This exemption will permit developers ofthese numerous sites to promote and sell the revolving inventory of lotsunder a single common promotional plan without registration by simply meetingcertain eligibility requirements which are, for the most part, alreadycharacteristic of the offerings, and by providing general information aboutreal estate ownership along with a minimum of information about specificlots.Under the proposed exemption: The land being offered must be sold ``asis'' and must meet all local codes and standards; and amenities or facilitiesused in advertisements or other promotional materials must be completedand in the condition advertised; each lot must be accessible by a road;any exceptions to title must be approved by the purchaser in writing; thepurchaser must be contractually provided a seven day cancellation period;a warranty deed (or its equivalent) must be delivered within 180 days ofthe date of sale; the purchaser, or spouse, must make an on-site inspection;payments must be escrowed until a deed is delivered; and purchasers mustbe provided a statement which includes warnings about the risks of buyingland. The proposed exemption would not be available to offerings where the developeracquires lots in a subdivision which was established by another developerfor the purpose of making sales. This prohibition would exist whether theacquisition was, for example, from an active developer, residual inventoryfrom a previous developer, through tax delinquency sales of from individuallot owners. It is felt that individual purchasers from these ``secondary''developers need the intended benefits of disclosure and the protectionsof the Act, and the offering can be easily registered or qualify for oneof the existing exemptions.Likewise, the proposed exemption would not be applicable to any individualsite of 100 or more lots nor to an individual site of fewer than 100 lotswhere the developer either owns adjacent land or has an option, or otherevidence of intent, to acquire adjacent land which, when taken cumulatively,would or could equal 100 or more lots.Therefore, a developer who is operating under the proposed exemption andacquires a separate site containing or potentially containing 100 or morelots as described in either of the two preceding paragraphs, would necessarilybe required to isolate that site from any other eligible multiple sitecommon promotional plan(s), The ineligible site would then have to be registeredor qualify for one of the other available exemptions, but the principlesof separability would have to be strictly applied.In addition, subsequent to the effective date of the proposed exemption,OILSR will not recognize artificial barriers established for the sole purposeof segregating lot groupings to give the appearance of qualification forthe 100 lot exemption described at 24 CFR 1710.6. To implement this policy,the Department is proposing a closer adherance to the Congressional intentby restricting eligibility for the 24 CFR 1710.6 exemption to the smaller,individual subdivision where the developer owns fewer than 100 lots andwhere the developer's plan of operation is not to continually acquire anddispose of multiple sites in geographically dispersed locations. The proposed new exemption is a regulatory exemption and could be listedin 24 CFR 1710.14 but, because of the unique character of this exemption,it is being added as a new andSection; 1710.15, Regulatory Exemption_MultipleSite Subdivision_Determination Required. The termination provisions of24 CFR 1710.16 are included in the new section and the anti-fraud provisionsof 24 CFR 1710.4 (b) and (c) would also apply to this exemption. Also, a technical change is proposed to add the definition of the term``Site'', which is currently included in the exemption guidelines, to thedefinitions in andSection; 1710.1 of the Regulations. A finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD Regulations in 24 CFR Part 50 which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 SeventhStreet SW., Washington, DC 20410. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 10, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The rule was listed as item H-47-86 (Sequence Number 924) in the Department'sSemiannual Agenda of Regulations published in April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854,13872) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. Congress provided several specificexemptions from the Act, and from the registration requirements of theAct, for identified small entities. In 15 U.S.C. 1702(c), Congress alsodirected the Department to create, by regulation, additional exemptionsfor small entities whose offerings are of a small amount or limited character.This proposed exemption is being promulgated pursuant to that authority.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.801. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget, and assigned approvalnumber 2502-0243. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 1710 </ITAG>Consumer protection, Land sales, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, 24 CFR Part 1710 is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1710_LAND REGISTRATION</ITAG>1.
