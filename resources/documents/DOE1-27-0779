<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0779 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) commissioned an operations-relatedproject (RP1557-26) in mid-1986 to update the project data base developedfor EPRI Report NP-3370, &quot;Identification of Radwaste Sources and ReductionTechniques,&quot; which was published in January 1984. An update was deemedparticularly desirable in order to assess the impact on power reactorlow level radioactive waste generation of 10 CFR 61, the recent implementationof the 1985 Amendment to the Low Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 (andits potential effects on accelerated waste shipment programs), and theefforts of several plants to implement waste minimization program overthe past several years. These events, as reflected in waste generationrates from 1982 through 1985, should help NP-3370 continue to be a usefuldocument for a plant's radwaste manager in the future. Furthermore, thetrends of the past several years presented herein should help to moreaccurately define utility waste source terms for use in planning on-sitestorage and developing regional burial facilities. A new data base wasdeveloped that includes 1982 through 1986 information, as well as pertinentportions of the 1978 through 1981 data base. The result of the projectis a two volume report comprising radwaste related information from morethan 95% of the nuclear power plants in commerical operation as of 1986.Volume 1 contains all information pertaining to boiling water reactors(BWRs), while Volume 2 contains information for pressurized water reactors(PWRs). The computerized data base of waste volumes, sources and characteristicsfor each plant type (BWR or PWR) is included as an appendix in each respectivevolume. 36 figs., 26 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
