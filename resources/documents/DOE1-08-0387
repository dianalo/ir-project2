<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-0387 </DOCNO><TEXT>Unidirectional composites with a glassy or vitroceramic matrix and SiCNicalon fibers were developed by hot pressing. Good mechanical propertiescould be obtained at room temperature: an elastic module of 100 to 120GPa stressed to rupture of 600 to 800 MPa, pseudoproducible material.The temperature resistance is at present mediocre. A detailed analysisof the interfacial fiber-matrix relationship should make it possibleto resolve this point.</TEXT></DOC>
