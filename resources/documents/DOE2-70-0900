Petroleum development in Libya was started in 1955,and more than 3 million barrels of petroleum came to be produced perday in 1970 thanks to the light and low-sulfur quality of the petroleum.As a result of the nationalizing policy of petroleum undertakings afterthe revolution, the government's participation rate became 60.7% in 1974.The USA began sanction on Libya in 1981 and the export to the USA decreasedsuddenly, but Libya maintained the export amount of 1 million barrelsper day with the exports to Western Europe and with flexible export policies.These flexible policies, in a way, accelerated the adverse developmentin the market and caused the decrease of petroleum income. The constructionsof petroleum factories have been postponed or stopped because of thelow petroleum income, and the recent export amount of manufactured petroleumis only about 130,000 barrels per day. libya is, therefore, to push thediversification of undertakings and to develop gas resources and thelike in the future. In connection with the diversification of undertakings,Libya is actively pushing into the foreign petroleum markets and joininghands with foreign petroleum companies. (6 figs, 8 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
