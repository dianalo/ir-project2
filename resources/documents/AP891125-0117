Three crew members werefatally injured and a fourth apparently committed suicide.   Salvadoran and U.S. military officals said the flight of thesingle-engine Cessna originated in Nicaragua and that the crash wasproof Nicaragua's Soviet-backed Sandinista government smugglesweapons to El Salvador's guerrillas.   A second plane also apparently on an arms smuggling mission wasburned at a landing strip southeast of the capital San Salvador.Both planes apparently ran out of fuel.   Later, rebels fired on a military helicopter carrying reportersto the site of one of the two planes and two foreign cameramen werewounded.   Colleagues said Hugo Burgos, a camerman for Cable News Network,and Alfredo Hernandez Lopez, a reporter for the Mexican governmentradio network were wounded when the guerrillas opened fire nearZacatecoluca, 18 miles southeast of San Salvador.   The pilot managed to land the helicopter at the Comalapainternational airport and doctors at the Central Military Hospitalin San Salvador said Burgos was in serious but stable condition andHernandez suffered minor injuries.   The Cessna was carrying 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-airmissiles _ 24 Soviet-made and one U.S.-made _ a Soviet-designedanti-tank weapon and mortar shells. It crashed in a soybean fieldjust north of the town of El Transito, about 60 miles east of SanSalvador.   The Salvadoran military press office reported Saturday afternoonthat the second light plane, which had been used to smuggle weaponsto the rebels, was set afire on a dirt landing strip 7 milessoutheast of Zacatecoluca.   It said residents of the area told army officers the plane'screw unloaded boxes, presumably containing ammunition, after itlanded. The press office said the plane apparently did not haveenough fuel to take off and the crew burned the craft and then fled.   The Cessna, painted black and with no registration number, didnot burn. Col. Ricardo Casanova, commander of the 6th army brigade,said it crashed when it ran out of fuel.   Fredy Garay, a peasant who lives about a mile from the crashsite, told reporters he heard a sputtering motor and the sound of acrash at 5:30 a.m. He said as he and a friend approached thewreckage they heard a single shot.   Garay said two of the plane's crewmen were dead, one diedshortly after he and his friend arrived and the fourth was deadfrom a bullet wound in his right temple.   Three of the victims wore military fatigue uniforms. None of thefour had identification papers, and officials said it was presumedthey were Nicaraguans.   An officer showed reporters a Belgian-made Browning pistol thathe said presumably was used by the crewman who shot himself.   Engraved on the pistol was, ``Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua'' _Nicaraguan national guard.   The rear cargo section of the plane was intact but the frontsection was destroyed. Salvadoran troops and a U.S. militaryadviser were at the Piedra Pacha site within an hour after thecrash.   When reporters arrived at midday the weapons had been placed infront of the wreckage _ 24 Soviet-made SAM-7 missiles, oneU.S.-made Redeye anti-aircraft missile, a Soviet-made 75mmrecoiless rifle and 21 Soviet-manufactured 82mm mortar shells.   A flight plan found in the wreckage indicated the plane was tohave landed at a beach near Amatecampo, south of the capital.   Lt. Col. Luis Turcios told reporters the surface-to-air missilesrepresented ``a great threat.'' He also said the plane ``was proofof Sandinista intervention in the Salvadoran conflict, of their aidto the terrorists.''   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front havenot used surface-to-air missiles in their 10-year-old war against asuccession of U.S.-backed governments. Such missiles could providea tactical boost to the rebels, who last week waged their biggestoffensive of the war.   El Salvador is northwest of Nicaragua and the two countries areseparated by the Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific Ocean. They do notshare a land frontier.</TEXT></DOC>
