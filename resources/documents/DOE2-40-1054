Several methods for examining compositematerials are investigated and documented. Polishing techniques for thismaterial are described. An interference layering method is developedto reveal the structure of the fiber, the reaction zone, and variousphases within the matrix. Microprobe and transmission electron microscope(TEM) analyses are performed on the fiber/matrix interface. A detaileddescription of the fiber distribution as well as the microstructure ofthe fiber and matrix are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
