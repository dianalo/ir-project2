Ambassador Manuel Pacavira told reporters that his governmentdid not consider the U.S.-backed rebels in the south of Angola alegitimate force.   ``In Angola there is no opposition, there is no civil war,''Pacavira said. ``What exists in Angola is a military confrontationwith South Africa and its paramilitary forces ... UNITA.''   The rebels, headed by Jonas Savimbi, calls themselves UNITA forthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.   Earlier this week, Chester Crocker, the assistant secretary ofState for African affairs, said an unresolved civil war in Angola``could hamper and postpone'' efforts to reach a troop withdrawalagreement.   Crocker mediated an agreement between Angola, South Africa andCuba under which Pretoria began withdrawing its troops from Angolaon Wednesday. The parties will next try to reach agreement on thewithdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers from Angola.   Negotiators, however, have not tried to resolve Angola's civilwar. The United States has supported the concept of nationalreconcilation talks between the Luanda government and UNITA, whichcontrols large areas of land.   But Pacavira said his government has proposed a program of``national harmonization'' if UNITA fighters surrender. Individualguerrillas would be integrated into society, he said.   The offer does not extend to Savimbi, who has good relationswith the Reagan administration. ``I cannot comment on what willhappen to him,'' Pacavira said.   He called Savimbi a ``terrorist'' and an opportunist who ``todayis with God and tomorrow is with the devil.''   The ambassador also said the United States should stop itssupport for Savimbi, though such as act would not necessarily meanthe Angolan government would stop accepting military aid from theSoviet Union.   ``U.S. assistance to UNITA cannot be conditioned in any form tothe Soviet assistance to Angola,'' he said   On a related issue, Pacavira denied that the Soviet Union haspressured Angola into signing a cease-fire.</TEXT></DOC>
