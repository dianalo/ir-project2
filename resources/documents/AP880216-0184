(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Among the also-rans, Gary Hart and BruceBabbitt failed in New Hampshire to extract themselves from thebottom of the seven-man Democratic heap, but Pete du Pont'sslow-but-improved showing on the Republican side Tuesday gave himcause for hope.   None of the last-tier candidates was counting himself out asvotes from the nation's first primary rolled in. But in the days tocome, New Hampshire still could send a few candidates packingbefore Super Tuesday rolls around March 8.   Proving that in politics all things are relative, du Pont, whowas running fourth in the five-man Republican field, said: ``Thishas been a terrific evening for us here in New Hampshire.''   He had finished fifth in a six-man field _ before the withdrawalof Alexander Haig _ in Iowa's caucuses a week earlier.   Du Pont's showing was just shy of Jack Kemp and ahead ofRobertson, according to partial returns. All three trailedfront-runner George Bush and his main rival, Bob Dole.   For the Democrats, Babbitt edged out Hart. Ahead of them wereJesse Jackson and Albert Gore, each of whom had solid organizationsawaiting them in the South. Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon were inthe strong second tier behind winner Michael Dukakis.   Hart, who won New Hampshire when he ran in 1984 but whosecandidacy has failed to catch fire since he re-entered the 1988race, called his meager showing at the bottom of the Democraticpack this time ``disappointing ... but not discouraging.''   The former Colorado senator said he expects to be a candidate``as far ahead in the future as I can see'' but he was pragmaticabout the need to start picking up some solid support that wouldtranslate into the dollars and delegates needed to win nomination.   ``I understand that there are standards that have to be met interms of delegates and votes,'' he said. ``It will take at least 30to 60 days to determine if I can put together a viable candidacy.''   Babbitt, who had said prior to the New Hampshire primary thatits voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy,insisted he wasn't ready to start planning his funeral just yet.   ``I'm going to move on for a couple of days to Washington in acouple of days and call and talk to my supporters all over thecountry and ask them this question: How ... can we keep this reformmovement alive?''   Jackson said he met with Babbitt on Tuesday night and discussedgetting his support.   ``Our message has tremendous overlap ... I hope that in time wewill work out some common ground in terms of our politics,''Jackson said.   Robertson failed to repeat his dramatic second-place showingfrom Iowa, but had never claimed he'd sweep New Hampshire. He hadbetter prospects in sight in the South and plenty of money on handto propel him forward.   One of the also-rans from the Iowa caucuses never even made itas far as the New Hampshire primary. Haig last week bowed out andthrew his support to Dole.</TEXT></DOC>
