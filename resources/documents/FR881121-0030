On July 26, 1988, the Coast Guard announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 28024) a series of public hearings onthe notice of proposed rulemaking. These hearings were held on August 10,1988 in Houston, Texas; August 12, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois; August 19,1988 in Washington, DC; and August 22, 1988 in San Francisco, California.A total of 80 individuals made statements on the proposed rules at thesehearings. Each hearing was recorded, and copies of the tapes, along withany written statements and other materials provided, have been placed inthe public docket. The Coast Guard also received a total of 246 letterscommenting on the proposed rules. All of this information has been reviewedand considered in the development of the final rule. The Office of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation is publishingelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4> an Interim Final Rule and request for commentsentitled <T3>Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs.</T3>These Procedures, which will be codified in 49 CFR Part 40, are based onDepartment of Health and Human Services Guidelines for Drug Testing, withappropriate modifications to allow them to apply to private industry andstate and local governments. The new 49 CFR Part 40 provides detailed informationfor implementation of the drug testing requirements of this rule, settingforth requirements for such things as specimen collection procedures, laboratoryprocedures, and quality assurance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this document are CDR John Koski,Project Manager, and Christena Green, Project Counsel, Office of ChiefCounsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The Coast Guard has explicit statutory authority to deny issuance of alicense, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document to anyindividual who (1) has been convicted of violating a dangerous drug lawof the United States or a state within 10 years of application, or (2)has ever been a user of, or addicted to, a dangerous drug (46 U.S.C. 7503).Similarly, the Coast Guard has statutory authority to revoke a license,certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document of any individualwho is, or has been, a user of, or addicted to, a dangerous drug (46 U.S.C.7704(c)). The Coast Guard is further mandated to revoke the license, certificateof registry, or merchant mariner's document of any individual who has beenconvicted of violating a dangerous drug law of the United States or a statewithin a 10 year period before the beginning of the proceedings againstthat individual (46 U.S.C. 7704(b)). It is clear that these statutes intendto exclude drug users and violators of drug statutes from serving on U.S.merchant vessels. As the Coast Guard stated in its notice of proposed rulemaking, these statutesare currently enforced by examining criminal conviction records of licenseand document applicants and holders, by the prosecution of those individualsoperating a vessel negligently or while intoxicated, and through administrativeremedies such as civil penalty actions and suspension and revocation proceedings.These methods are used, however, only after an incident occurs and theCoast Guard obtains evidence on which to base remedial or punitive action.This final rule is a logical extension of existing regulations to ensurea drug-free working environment in the maritime community. The regulationsprovide for positive and aggressive action to identify users of dangerousdrugs before they are involved in incidents which bring them to the attentionof the Coast Guard. The regulations are intended to ensure that users ofdangerous drugs are not issued licenses, certificates of registry, or merchantmariner's documents, and are not accepted for employment on vessels engagedin commercial operations. Drug users and abusers will either be deterredfrom continued drug use or will be faced with sufficient probability ofbeing identified in the workplace and precluded from employment in theindustry when such use is detected through chemical testing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>General Overview of Major Issues The Coast Guard received 246 written comments in response to the noticeof proposed rulemaking. Despite the fact that some of these were receivedafter the close of the comment period, all were considered in the formulationof these rules. In addition to the written responses, 80 individuals presentedtestimony at the four public hearings held by the Coast Guard. All facets of the maritime industry presented their views, either as individuals,small operators, large corporations, unions, or associations. While therewas universal support for a drug-free maritime working environment, therewas serious concern about how the Coast Guard proposed to accomplish thisgoal. Several sectors felt that the scope of the proposed regulations was toobroad and would result in unbearable implementation costs, most notablyamong small operators. Many felt that only those people operating underthe authority of a Coast Guard issued license or merchant mariner's documentshould be subjected to mandatory drug testing. Echoing this opinion, manyothers stated that employees serving aboard vessels in capacities whichhad nothing to do with the safe operation of the vessel should not be subjectto the mandatory testing requirements. Small operators and seasonal operators were seriously concerned that mandatorytesting would result in shortages in their workforces, maintaining thatpotential employees would opt to go into other, equally well-paying jobswhich do not require them to be subjected to testing. In addition, a companyadministered testing program would erode the trust which has typicallybeen established between management and the working members of small operations.Commenters generally supported testing in conjunction with obtaining licensesand post-casualty testing, but felt that such programs should be administeredby the Coast Guard and not private industry. There was a split of opinionregarding other types of testing (i.e., pre-employment, random, and reasonablecause): those companies and organizations which currently have effectiveanti-drug programs generally supported these types of testing, while thosewithout such programs did not feel that all types of testing should berequired. Even among those which had existing programs, there was concernthat the strict parameters specified in the proposed rules would forcethem to abandon their programs in order to implement the procedures whichare much more costly and more difficult to administer but, in their view,not necessarily more effective. Among individual commenters and labor unions,the opinion was almost universal that mandatory testing would be a violationof constitutional rights, with guilt being assumed until the individualcould establish innocence. Constitutional Issues Numerous commenters questions the constitutionality of mandatory drug testingof maritime employees. Many commenters requested that the Coast Guard notproceed with this regulatory package until these issues have been resolvedby the Supreme Court. <T3>Response:</T3> Although the state of the case law is still evolvingin rapid fashion and the Supreme Court has not resolved many of the relevantand complex issues, the Coast Guard is confident that testing of employeesunder this rule will withstand judicial scrutiny on constitutional grounds.Of particular concern to the commenters is the relevance of the FourthAmendment to drug testing. The principles of the Fourth Amendment to theU.S. Constitution are paramount in scrutinizing the fundamental legalityof many drug testing programs. As a threshold matter, the Fourth Amendmentapplies to ``searches'' conducted or mandated by the government and protectsindividuals against ``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Action of aprivate party does not constitute State or Federal action unless thereexists a close nexus between the State and the action in question. <T3>See Jackson v. </T3><T3>Metropolitan Edison,</T3> 419 U.S. 345 (1974); <T3>Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis,</T3> 407 U.S. 163 (1972). Assuming that drug testing programs called for under the final rule doimplicate the government, a second issue then arises concerning whetherurine tests under these programs are ``searches'' within the meaning ofthe Fourth Amendment. Although most courts to address the issue to datehave ruled that toxicological testing of employees for the purpose of determiningfitness for duty is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,the issue is not entirely settled. <T3>See Wyman v. James,</T3> 400 U.S. 309, 317-338 (1971) (government welfarecaseworker's ``home visit'' as a precondition for assistance payments isnot a Fourth Amendment search). <T3>See also, Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga,</T3> 1988 U.S. App. Lexis6952 (6th Cir. May 23, 1988) (Guy, J., dissenting); <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab,</T3> 808 F.2d 1057,1060, 1062 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham, J., concurring). <T3>Cf Mack v. United States, F.B.I.,</T3> 814 F.2d 120, 125 n.2 (2nd Cir.1987). Also assuming, <T3>arguendo,</T3> that urine tests of merchant vessel personnel for prohibitedsubstances are ``searches'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,it is clear that while searches ordinarily must be conducted pursuant toa warrant issued on probable cause grounds, such a requirement is not alwaysnecessary. <T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</T3> 413 U.S. 266, 277 (1973) (Powell,J., concurring). Where, for example, ``* * * the burden of obtaining awarrant is likely to frustrate the government purpose behind the search* * *'' the Supreme Court has routinely held that a warrant is not requiredby the Fourth Amendment [citing <T3>Camera v. Municipal Court,</T3> 387 U.S. 523, 533 (1967)]. <T3>See e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin,</T3> 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3167 (1987) (pluralityopinion); <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985). The Supreme Courthas likewise found that the probable cause standard is inappropriate whereit would defeat the purpose that the search is designed to achieve. <T3>See e.g., New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 325 at 340-342 (1976)(While ``* * * some quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisiteto constitutional search or seizure [,] * * * the Fourth Amendment imposesno irreducible requirement of such suspicion'' <T3>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,</T3> 428 U.S. 543, 560-561). Rather, ``[t]he fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searchesand seizures be reasonable * * *'' <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 328 at 340. In determining thereasonableness of a search, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed theimportance of the facts particular to the search while acknowledging thatthe test of reasonableness ``* * * is not capable of precise definitionor mechanical application.'' <T3>Bell v. Wolfish,</T3> 441 U.S. 520, at 559 (1979). In analyzing a drugtesting program, ``* * * what is reasonable depends on the context withinwhich a search takes place.'' <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 325, at 337. In scrutinizing whether a particular search comports with the Fourth Amendment,courts have adopted a balancing test. In general, to support a claim thata search of an individual or the individual's property is reasonable, thegovernment must demonstrate that, on balance, the public's legitimate interestin conducting the search outweighs the individual's legitimate expectationof privacy. <T3>See e.g., United States v. Montoya de Hernandez,</T3> 473 U.S. 531,537 (1985); <T3>United States v. Villamonte-Marquez,</T3> 462 U.S. 579, 588 (1983);<T3>Delaware vs. Prouse,</T3> 440 U.S. 648, 653 (1979). Thus, the courtsmust ``* * * consider the scope of the particular intrustion, the mannerin which it is conducted, the justification for initating it, and the placein which it is conducted.'' <T3>Bell v. Wolfish, </T3>441 U.S. 520, at 559. Viewed in this light, it is beyond dispute that the public has an overridinginterest in assuring that merchant vessel personnel performing duties whichdirectly affect the safety of a vessel's navigation or operations do sofree of prohibited substances. The drug problem in society in general andevidence of drug use in the maritime industry in particular are discussedelsewhere in the preamble of this final rule. The impairing effects ofdrugs and the substantial risks to public safety posed by merchant vesselpersonnel who use drugs underlies the compelling governmental interestin promulating this rule. In contrast, the drug testing requirements of the final rule involve aminimal invasion of privacy. As the Supreme Court has indicated, wheresearches are undertaken in situations where individualized suspicion islacking, other safeguards must be relied upon to ensure that the discretionof the party conducting the search is properly defined and the scope ofthe search is limited. <T3>See Delaware v. Prouse,</T3> 440 U.S. 648, at 654-655; <T3>New York v. Burger,</T3> 107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987). The drug testing requirementsof the final rule place constraints on an employer's discretion in conductingdrug testing. For example, the requirement for random drug tsting callsfor selection of an employee to be tested in a scientifically acceptablemanner, such as use of a computer-based random number generator. Requirementsfor testing based on reasonable cause or post-accident testing also areseverely circumscribed in order to limit an employer's discretion in administeringthese tests to employees. The actual testing procedures that each employer is required to implementunder this final rule also are narrowly tailored to respect an employee'sreasonable expectations of privacy. The procedures governing collectionof urine samples, as referenced in the final rule, are carefully designedto preserve privacy while protecting the integrity of the sample. The finalrule contains a number of important employee safeguards, including privacyduring collection under most types of tests, stringent laboratory safeguards,and provisions for challenging results. Equally significant is the fact that urine drug testing of employees performingsensitive safety-related duties is to be conducted in the ``context'' ofthe employment relationship. As the Supreme Court has noted, ``[t]he operationalrealities of the workplace * * * may make <T3>some</T3> employees' expectation of privacy unreasonable'' <T3>O'Connor v. Orgega,</T3> 107 S.Ct. 1492 (1987). This is particularlyimportant in circumstances where the employee works in an industry in whichan employee's activities are subject to extensive regulation. Thus, personswho work in such ``closely regulated'' industries have a ``reduced expectationof privacy'' [<T3>New York v. Burger, </T3>107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987)] and, ``in effect consent[ ] to the restrictions placed upon them'' [<T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</T3> 413 U.S. at 271)]. For thesereasons, two Federal Courts of Appeals have upheld urinalysis testing,in the absence of particularized suspicion, in industries where pervasiveregulation has reduced an employee's expectation of privacy. <T3>See Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power Dist.,</T3> 844 F.2d 562, 566(8th Cir. 1988) (nuclear plant operators); <T3>Shoemaker v. Handel,</T3> 795 F.2d 1136, 1142 (3rd Cir.), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 479 U.S. 986 (1986) (jockeys); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n. Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>1988 U.S. App. Lexis 8443 (3rd Cir. June 21, 1988) (police officers). The Coast Guard recognizes that a number of Federal and State courts haverejected government-mandated drug testing program on Fourth Amendment grounds.However, even courts striking drug testing programs have recognized thatdrug testing is appropriate in other contexts. <T3>See e.g., Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga,</T3> 1988 U.S.App. Lexis6952 at 23 (6th Cir. May 23, 1988) (Martin, J.) (``When determining, thenwhether a mandatory drug search is ``reasonable,'' we believe that, asthe costs to society of an impaired employee increase, the requisite levelof suspicion that a drug problem exists decreases.''); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n. Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>672 F.supp. 779, 792 (D.N.J. 1987), <T3>rev'd,</T3> 1988 U.S.App. Lexis 8443 (3rd Cir. June 21, 1988) (``[T]heneed to prevent a major airline disaster presents a far more compellingrationale than those presented [by the municipality in support of testingits police officer.]''); <T3>American Federation of Government Employees v. Meese, </T3> No. C-88-1419-SAW(N.D. Cal. June 16, 1988) (issuing a preliminary injunction against a Bureauof Prison plan to test randomly all agency employees but nonetheless notingthat ``[t]here are cases in which compulsory drug testing may be justifiedin the interest of public safety or security.'' Memorandum opinion at 2).The Coast Guard also is aware of the recent Ninth Circuit decision thatheld that the Federal Railroad Administration's mandatory blood and urinetesting after certain accidents, incidents, or rule violations is unconstitutionalbecause the rules do not require a showing of ``particularized suspicion''of drug or alcohol impairment prior to testing. <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley,</T3> 839 F.2d 575(9th Cir.), <T3>cert. granted,</T3> 108 S.Ct. 2033 (1988). The Ninth Circuit basedits views, in part, on the proposition that `` * * * the vast bulk of [railroad]safety regulation is directed at owners and managers of railroads, notemployees.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 585. However, contrary to the circumstances in the railroadindustry, the Coast Guard has a long history of regulating licensed anddocumented maritime personnel.The Supreme Court has granted a government petition for a <T3>writ of certiorari</T3> in <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley,</T3> and has orderedthat this case be argued next term ``in tandem'' with <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab,</T3> 816 F.2d 170 (5thCir. 1987), <T3>cert. granted,</T3> 108 S.Ct. 1072 (1988) (upholding drug testing ofapplicants for critical safety or security sensitive positions in the U.S.Customs Service). Decisions in these cases may not be forthcoming untilthe spring of 1989. However, in the absence of Supreme Court guidance,the Coast Guard is convinced that the need for drug testing by urinalysisin the maritime industry to determine fitness of maritime personnel forduty in sensitive safety-related positions, and, thereby, to ensure publicsafety, clearly outweighs the privacy interest of individuals in this class.While not totally free from doubt, it is the opinion of the Departmentof Transportation that the Coast Guard's anti-drug progam, and similardrug testing regimens proposed by other administrations within the Department,will be determined to be constitutional. The critical need for properlyadministered drug testing to ensure that employees in the transportationindustry do not have drugs or drug metabolites in their systems while performingsensitive safety- or security-related functions outweighs the reduced privacyinterest of these employees.Lack of Evidence of a Drug Problem in the Maritime IndustryVarious segments of the maritime industry have asserted that there hasbeen no demonstrated need to mandate industry-wide drug testing of maritimeemployees.<T3>Response</T3>: The Coast Guard clearly stated in the preamble of thenotice of proposed rulemaking that it did not have data which specificallyidentified the use of drugs or alcohol as a major causal effect in commercialvessel losses or casualty damage. However, many commenters submitted datato indicate that company-sponsored drug testing programs have resultedin significant documented reductions in drug usage among their employees.For example, a major maritime association testified that the lost-timeincidence among its member companies has decreased by some 50 percent,and that much of this decline can be attributed to their drug interdictionprograms. Other companies have reported similar successes. This informationsupports the Coast Guard contention that the marine industry is not immuneto the drug probem that exists in society in general. It further illustratesthat drug testing programs do decrease the incidence of drug usage by maritimepersonnel.Accuracy of Drug Test ResultsMany commenters base their opposition to drug testing on the perceivedinaccuracy of analysis and test results. The commenters raised the issuesof false-positive test results, passive inhalation of illicit drugs, misidentificationof licit drugs, and ingestion of food substances such as poppy seeds whichmay result in a positive drug test result.<T3>Response</T3>: Each of these issues surfaced with the first seriesof drug testing programs introduced in the military and the private sector.Since that time, laboratories have been increasingly sophisticated in theiranalytical methods. Many laboratories have compiled extensive records demonstratingscientific accuracy and protection of individual specimens. Today false-positivetest results occur primarily during analysis of a specimen provided duringan initial screening test. However, the initial screening test is usedonly to yield a preliminary indication of the possible presence of drugs.In order to ensure the integrity and accuracy of any test result, the CoastGuard has determined that each positive initial screening test result mustbe confirmed using Gas Chromotography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The GC/MSconfirmation test is an extremely accurate test and is virtually error-freewhen properly conducted. This final rule specifies explicit procedureswhich must be followed to ensure accurate drug test results.The final rule requires that employers establish and utilize drug testingprograms which comply with the requirements of 49 CFR Part 40. These regulationsare patterned after the ``Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace DrugTesting Programs,'' published by the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) on April 11, 1988. These regulations provide a system of checksand balances during collection and analysis of specimens to ensure theintegrity and accuracy of the tests using appropriate scientific methodsand rigid chain-of-custody procedures. An employer may only use a laboratorythat complies with the regulations and has been certified by the DHHS toprocess and analyze specimens required by the Coast Guard rule. Finally, the Coast Guard believes that the Medical Review Officer (MRO)review process that has been provided in 49 CFR Part 40 will preclude misidentificationof food substances or licit drugs that might produce a false-positive testresult. The procedures provide an individual with an opportunity to reportany legal or prescription drugs that he or she may be taking at the timeof collection of the specimen. The MRO's broad authority to interpret eachconfirmed positive test result, to interview and evaluate an employee,and to verify that a confirmed positive test result is accurate shouldpreclude misidentification of licit drugs taken in accordance with a validprescription or food substances. In summary, the Coast Guard believes thatthe two-step analysis process, coupled with the requirements for independentreview by an MRO, provides a process by which an individual is protectedfrom erroneous false-positive drug test results. <T3>Periodic Testing in Conjunction With License Application or Renewal</T3>While many commenters voiced support for the concept that applicants fororiginal and renewed licenses, certificates of registry, and merchant mariner'sdocuments should be subjected to drug testing, there was almost universalagreement that the costs and responsibility for administering such testingshould be borne by the Coast Guard. Further, commenters generally feelthat periodic testing has no deterrent value because an employee may temporarilyabstain from drug use prior to such a test. <T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard agrees with the commenters that predeterminedperiodic testing can be circumvented by a person's abstinence from druguse. However, periodic testing does enable the Coast Guard to identifythose persons who are so heavily-dependent on drugs that they are unableto abstain from drug use for even a short period of time prior to a periodictest. The suggestion that the cost for such testing be borne by the Coast Guardhas not been adopted in the final rule. Costs for such testing should appropriatelybe borne by the person desiring a license, certificate of registry or merchantmariner's document, as are the costs for required physical examinations.There is no reason to impose these costs on the taxpayer, which would bethe effect if the Coast Guard were to pay for the testing. Periodic testingwill be required in conjunction with required physical examinations afterimplementation of the rule. However, the periodic testing requirement maybe met by satisfactory evidence that an individual has passed a recentdrug test or has been participating in a random drug testing program forthe previous year. <T3>Pre-employment Testing </T3>Many commenters felt that pre-employment testing was a needless cost toincur since the job applicants would have been tested to obtain their license,certificate of registry or merchant mariner's document and would be immediatelysubject to the company's random testing program once he or she was hired.They also noted the transient nature of employment in the maritime industry,with mariners frequently signing on a vessel for a single trip, or beingemployed on a succession of vessels. <T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard believes that pre-employment testingis a necessary component of an effective anti-drug program. The Coast Guardacknowledges that needless, redundant testing could result if all job applicantswere required to undergo pre-employment drug testing. Accordingly, thefinal rule has been modified to permit employers to hire, without a pre-employmentdrug test, an individual who can provide satisfactory evidence that heor she has passed a previous pre-employment or periodic drug test withinsix months of applying for their position or if that individual can establishthat, over the previous twelve months he or she has been subject to a randomtesting program meeting the requirements of these regulations. Random Testing   Numerous comments were provided concerning the issue of random testing.Some addressed the constitutionality of the tests. Many companies wereparticularly concerned with the proposed method of selecting employeesto be tested. For the widely-scattered and often remotely located maritimeworkforce, employers felt that random selection of a unit or vessel andunannounced testing of the entire employee complement would provide a satisfactorydeterrent effect and would be the most cost-effective method of implementinga random testing program.  Most commenters believe that the proposed 125 percent random sampling ratewas excessive and would impose a significant economic burden, particularlyon small businesses. The commenters proposed a range of random samplingrates starting at 10 percent annually. The majority of the commenters suggestthat a 50 percent random sampling rate for the maritime industry is appropriate.These commenters believe that the 50 percent sampling rate accomplishesa deterrence level consistent with the intent of the proposal.  <T3>Response: </T3>While noting the constitutional issues surrounding theissue of random testing, the Coast Guard believes that random testing isa fundamental component of an effective drug testing program. Random testinghas proven to be an effective deterrent to drug use and will provide safetybenefits to the maritime community by reducing or eliminating drug useby maritime personnel. Random testing programs initiated by the military,including the Coast Guard, and private industry show declining drug use,evidenced by a decrease in the number of individuals who test positivefor drugs over the course of the drug testing program.  The Coast Guard agrees with the commenters who propose a 50 percent randomsampling rate and, therefore, has revised the random sampling provisionof the rule consistent with the majority of the comments received in responseto the NPRM. The 50 percent sampling rate will provide a sufficient deterrentto drug use without imposing an undue economic or administrative burdenon employers and employees subject to the requirements of the regulation.The frequency of testing and the development of a random selection methodfor testing has been left to the employer. The requirement remains, however,that the method chosen ensures that all employees have a substantiallyequal chance of being selected for testing and that no employee shall knowin advance when such testing will occur. A properly designed unit testingprogram could meet these requirements.  For some employers, particularly those with a large number of employeessubject to drug testing, it may be a substantial burden to move from nodrug testing to a 50 percent random testing rate. If required to have tested50 percent of all covered employees by the end of the first year, employersmight have to test at rates far above 50 percent toward the end of theyear to make up for lower rates at the beginning. Employers should be permittedto start out at a lower testing rate and work up to 50 percent as experienceis gained and the testing procedure becomes administratively routine. Wedo not want to create a situation which might lead to mistakes by requiringinitial testing at too high a rate.  The final rule, therefore, provides an implementation procedure that wouldallow employers to phase in random drug testing during the first 12 monthsin which tests are conducted. Employers would not be required to reachan annualized rate of 50 percent until the last test collection. The testswould have to be spaced reasonably through the year to permit the employerto phase into the 50 percent rate, and the total number of tests conductedwould have to equal at least 25 percent of the covered population.  Suppose, for example, that an employer has 1000 sensitive safety- and security-relatedemployees. At a 50 percent annual rate, 500 tests would have to be conductedduring a year. Under the phase-in, however, the employer could conductonly a few drug tests at the beginning of the program and then graduallyincrease the number of tests until, by the end of the first year, the annualizedrate of 50 percent was achieved. Thus, if the employer's drug testing plancontemplated administering random tests on 12 occasions during the year,the employer would need to administer at least 42 tests (500 divided by12) on the last occasion, but could administer fewer tests until then.Overall, the employer would have to conduct at least 250 random tests thefirst year. In subsequent years, the 50 percent rate would be maintained.Post-Casualty Testing   Numerous commenters felt that post-casualty testing was a law-enforcementfunction and was appropriately the responsibility of the Coast Guard. Employersgenerally objected to the proposal that post-casualty testing be conductedby crewmembers when medical personnel were not available.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard appreciates this opinion. However, inmany instances the Coast Guard would be unaware that a serious marine incidenthad occurred until receipt from a vessel master or owner of Form CG-2692,Report of Vessel Casualty. Since time is of the essence in post-casualtytesting, the responsibility for ensuring that it is accomplished wheneverpracticable has been left with the employer.DHHS Guidelines Many companies expressed concern over the required use of DHHS Guidelines,especially with respect to random testing programs which they presentlyhave in effect. They stated that such requirements would force them todrastically alter testing programs which have proven effective.  <T3>Response: </T3>In the notice of proposed rulemaking for this rule,the Coast Guard proposed that all drug testing take place in accordancewith the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs of theDepartment of Health and Human Services (53 FR 11970; April 11, 1988).These guidelines describe the collection and testing procedures applicableto all drug testing in the Federal government, and they include safeguardsfor accuracy and privacy of testing.  The Department of Transportation has determined that certain modificationsof the DHHS Guidelines are appropriate in the context of this and otherDOT operating administration drug-free regulations. The result is the DOT``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs,'' whichwill be codified at 49 CFR Part 40. These DOT Procedures are intended topreserve, to the greatest extent practicable, the important safeguardsprovided by the HHS Guidelines.    Some of the modifications to the DHHS Guidelines are editorial in nature(for example, references to responsibilities of ``agencies'' are changedto reference ``employers''). Other modifications are intended to take intoaccount differences in the situations of Federal agencies and DOT regulatedindustries. For example, in testing at remote sites, DOT regulated industriesmay find it necessary to conduct some kinds of testing in medical facilities,through use of mobile units, or in ordinary toilet facilities, rather thanthe more permanent collection sites contemplated by the DHHS Guidelines.It may not be practicable for the regulated parties to maintain on-sitepermanent log books. Consequently, the DOT Procedures permit alternativecollection and recordkeeping procedures in these circumstances.  During the comment period on this drug-free workplace rule and those proposedby other operating administrations, comments were received concerning theDHHS Guidelines. These comments will be incorporated in the docket forthe Office of the Secretary (OST) interim final rule creating 49 CFR Part40. The OST will respond to those comments, as well as comments receivedduring the comment period for Part 40, in its notice following the endof that comment period.Applicability   Many comments were received that stated the scope of applicability of theproposed rule was too broad. They feel many positions in the marine transportationindustry are not directly related to vessel navigation or safety, thisbeing especially true in smaller vessel operations such as excursion boats,and on fish processing vessels. Requiring testing of caterers, bartenders,and musicians on small passenger vessels, or people involved in factory-typefunctions aboard fish processing vessels would prove excessively costlyto the operators and such testing would not enhance the safety of navigationor vessel operation.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard agrees with this view. The regulationsin the final rule have been changed to eliminate pre-employment, for cause,and random testing requirements for employees whose duties do not directlyaffect a vessel's safe navigation or operation. In addition to the personsdiscussed above, the Coast Guard has determined that scientific personnelon oceanographic research vessels can be exempted.Employee Assistance Programs  Employee assistance programs received wide support with the exception ofrequiring rehabilitation as part of the program. There was strong oppositionfrom employers to any mandated rehabilitation program. Employers feel itis essential for them to retain the right to terminate a person's employment,if they desire, should that person test positive for drugs. Union commentsgenerally favor some requirement for rehabilitation of testing is mandated. <T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard agrees that rehabilitation of an employeeis not directly related to the safety of the vessel. The Coast Guard'sconcern is solely that persons who are impaired, or are likely to be impaired,are not carrying out safety-related duties. Employee rehabilitation shouldbe a decision of the employer or agreed upon between labor and managementduring the collective bargaining process. The requirement for mandatoryreinstatement of an employee who successfully completes rehabilitationhas been deleted from the final rule. However, a person may not returnto a safety-related position after testing positive for drugs without theMRO's recommendation. The person must agree to unannounced testing fora period of 60 months. In addition, the provisions of 46 CFR Part 5 concerningsuspension or revocation of a license, certificate of registry, or merchantmariners document, and their restoration, apply.Comments that the Proposed Rules are Politically-Motivated  Over 80 commenters addressed the ``short'' comment period allowed for evaluatingthe proposed regulations. Extentions of the comment period for 30 to 180days were requested. Many commenters suggested that the proposed rulesbe reissued as an ANPRM, while others requested that an SNPRM be issuedbefore publication of a final rule. The general perception of many in theindustry was that the Coast Guard was rushing to final rule in this instancebecause of the up-coming elections in November.<T3>Response: </T3>Because this issue was raised so frequently by the commenters,the Coast Guard chose to address these comments although they do not addressthe substance of the rule. The war against drugs is one of this Administration'stop priorities. Also, Congress has enacted, and is considering, a substantialamount of legislation addressing the use, distribution, importation, andinterdiction of drugs in the United States. Moreover, a significant numberof public opinion polls indicate that the American public is deeply concernedabout the effect of drug use by individuals in critical safety occupations,including the maritime industry. Development of this rule is motivatedby the current political climate only to the extent that these attitudescoincide with the Coast Guard's statutory duties and authority. The CoastGuard is implementing these comprehensive anti-drug regulations becausethey are consistent with our statutory authority and responsibility topromulgate minimum standards to ensure and promote maritime safety.Medical Review OfficersNumerous comments were received which indicated opposition to the requirementthat employers hire a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to evaluate the resultsdetermined to be positive by a testing laboratory. Employers felt thatthe laboratories would best be able to ascertain the validity of positivetest results and the requirement for an MRO represented an unnecessaryexpense.<T3>Response: </T3>After consideration of the comments on the issue ofthe MROs, the Coast Guard has determined that the requirements to utilizean MRO are appropriate. The Coast Guard believes that the review and evaluationfunctions of an MRO, as set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, provide critical andnecessary safeguards for an employee who is subject to drug testing underthe comprehensive anti-drug program. The Coast Guard beleives that theMRO will prove to be a beneficial asset to both employees and employerswho are subject to the provisions of the final rule.Neither this rule nor 49 CFR Part 40 requires that each employer have itsown individual MRO. The Coast Guard anticipates that small entities willbecome associated with large companies, or will participate in a consortiumof small companies, in order to comply with the MRO requirements, and thatthe services of an MRO will not result in unreasonable costs to small entities.Costs of ImplementationMany commenters stated that the Coast Guard has seriously underestimatedthe cost of implementing these regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard agrees that the certain cost estimatesin the NPRM were lower than can be expected (e.g., initial screen and confirmatorytesting costs). These have been increased in the development of the finalregulatory impact analysis. However, because of changes included in thefinal rule (e.g., elimination of rehabilitation requirements and reducingthe random testing rate to 50 percent), the estimated overall cost of implementingthese regulations has dropped from $62.30 million to a maximum of $9.22million during the third year of implementation to a constantly recurringannual cost of $7.20 million after the fifth year.Exemption of Seasonal or Temporary EmployeesNumerous requests were received from small passenger vessel operators andothers to exclude seasonal or temporary employees. They expressed sincereconcerns that requiring prospective employees to undergo pre-employmentdrug testing and to then be subjected to a random testing program wouldresult in many individuals, notably high school or college students, seekingemployment elsewhere. This, in turn, would greatly increase the difficultyof obtaining sufficient help to run a seasonal operation.<T3>Response: </T3>As stated previously in this preamble, the Coast Guardhas modified the scope of these regulations to exclude persons who arenot involved as ``crewmembers'' aboard a vessel. Small passenger vesseloperators will not be required to test employees serving as waiters, waitresses,cooks, bartenders, entertainers, etc., provided their duties do not directlyaffect the safety of the vessel's navigation or operations. Similarly,many seasonal employees on fish processing vessels are exempted. Thesechanges should alleviate the problems associated with temporary employees.The Coast Guard appreciates the concerns expressed by parties employinghigh school or college age workers on a seasonal basis. However, many ofthese persons are solely or primarily responsible for the safe operationof the vessel as for example, a yacht club tender, camp boating instructor,or licensed operator of a sport fishing boat carrying six or fewer passengers.Safety concerns are not lessened because these persons are employed ona seasonal or temporary basis. In fact, there is considerable opinion,and some evidence, that the incidence of drug use is higher among the highschool and college age group. The final rule does not exempt seasonal ortemporary ``crewmembers'' from the testing requirements.Alternate Testing Technologies<T3>Testing of Hair: </T3>A number of comments addressed the issue of usingtesting technologies different from those proposed by the Coast Guard.Three comments suggested that Radio Immunoassy of Hair be permitted asan alternative to urinalysis.<T3>Response: </T3>Because the suggestion of drug testing using analysisof hair specimens raises an issue within the expertise of DHHS, the CoastGuard does not intend to include testing of hair at this time. If DHHSfinds this drug testing method satisfactory in the future, and if the DOTprocedures in 49 CFR Part 40 are revised to include this testing method,or any other proven testing technology, the Coast Guard will adopt themin their rules also.<T3>Breath Testing Devices: </T3>Many commenters objected to the requirementin the proposed rules that all inspected vessels certificated for unrestrictedocean routes, and all inspected vessels certificated for restricted overseasroutes, have on board at all times an evidential breath testing device(EBT) approved by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.They objected primarily to the high initial costs of obtaining this equipmentand having to train crewmembers to properly calibrate and operate thesedevices and to perform post-casualty breath testing on fellow crewmembers.<T3>Response: </T3>After reviewing the comments on this issue, the CoastGuard has revised the proposed rule to allow carriage of any breath testingdevice capable of accurately detecting the presence of alcohol in a crewmember'ssystem. Some of these devices have been shown to be very accurate, easyto use, and inexpensive.Because of the wide variety of breath testing devices available under therevised rule, the Coast Guard will require only that such devices be usedin accordance with procedures specified by the manufacturer. This changewill provide employers with sufficient flexibility to choose any accuratebreath testing device compatible with their operational circumstances.The use of alcohol is not automatically disqualifying. The weight to begiven test results in determining whether the standards of 33 CFR Part95 have been violated is up to the Administrative Law Judge who can considerthe type of device and the conditions under which the test was administered.The Coast Guard appreciates the concerns raised about testing fellow crewmembers,and allows blood or breath samples to be collected by medical personnelor other qualified nonvessel personnel whenever practicable. However, ifa vessel is in a location where such personnel are not available to conductsuch tests, breath testing would be required to be done by vessel personnel.Blood testing can only be conducted by qualified medical personnel. Thealternative, to forego readily available evidence concerning whether alcoholwas involved in a casualty, would not be in compliance with the intentof 46 U.S.C. 6101.Conflict with Foreign, State or Local Laws, or with Existing AgreementsNumerous comments indicated that drug testing of individuals was contraryto existing foreign or state laws prohibiting such testing. Other commentsstated that the current programs are the result of collective bargainingagreements with affected unions and that the requirements of the proposedrules will send them back to the bargaining table.<T3>Response: </T3>The Coast Guard recognizes that some state or locallaws and some foreign laws may prohibit or limit the testing required underthe final rule. Because of the predominant role assigned the Coast Guardconcerning the safe operation of U.S. vessels in commercial service, itis the Coast Guard view that these rules preempt state laws. The complexityand variable circumstances encountered in the interaction of U.S. and foreignlaw concerning U.S. flag vessels operating within the jurisdiction of aforeign country requires each such situation to be separately analyzed.We are aware of concerns expressed by foreign entities and foreign governmentsconcerning the potential of our rule to have effect outside United Statesterritory. There are several kinds of situations in which this concernappears to arise.The first such situation involves a foreign citizen employed by a U.S.company. To begin with, we believe it is fundamental that a foreign citizenemployed in the United States by an American company is fully subject toU.S. law, including the requirements for drug testing. With respect toemployees of an American company located in a foreign country, it is notour intention to require an employer to violate local law. The requirementto ensure that employees located in a foreign country are subject to drugtesting will not become effective until January 1, 1990. This additionalcompliance period is intended to minimize disruption for employers andemployees while the U.S. government meets with foreign governments to discussimplementation of the requirements of the rule.The second situation that has generated interest in this context concernsforeign entities that are contractors to U.S. companies. The Coast Guardposition is that a marine employer who uses contract personnel to performthe duties of a crewmember has ``engaged'' those personnel. Therefore,the final rule subjects employees of the contractor to the same drug-testingrequirements as direct employees of the marine employer. This requirementis necessary to ensure that U.S. companies do not circumvent the rule bycontracting out for services. Some foreign entities and their governments,however, have suggested that this gives the rule extraterritorial effect,since a foreign contractor, like a U.S. contractor, would have to complywith our rule.However, our rule does not <T3>require</T3> any foreign contractor to conduct drug testing of itsemployees. The rule imposes requirements only on the operator, i.e., marineemployer. It is the responsibility of the marine employer to ensure thatcrewmembers are drug-free, as enforced by the drug-testing program we aretoday establishing. In that respect, the drug-testing requirements arenot fundamentally different from other testing and training requirements.While it is true that foreign contractors will have to ensure that theiremployees who service U.S. companies meet our requirements, the same isalso true for U.S. contractors.Nevertheless, we appreciate the seriousness of the concerns expressed onthis point. Therefore, the final rule provides that U.S. companies cancontinue to use foreign contractor employees, whether or not they haveinstituted drug-testing programs, through December 31, 1989. This shortdelay in the application of our rule to foreign contractors will providean opportunity for additional discussion between governments.The third situation involves a foreign citizen, employed by a foreign company,on a U.S. vessel operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of theUnited States. Under agreement between the United States and Canada, Canadianpilots are required on American vessels under certain circumstances inboth American and Canadian waters. These pilots, moreover, may, at leastin some instances, be employees of the Canadian government. Representativesof the Canadian government have expressed the view that requiring testingof these pilots, even if they are in the United States at the time of thetest, might violate the Canadian Human Rights Act. While there is as yetno definitive understanding about the extent and effect of Canadian lawon random drug testing by Canadians operating in the United States, furtherconsultation with the Canadian government seems advisable. Under the circumstances,we have determined to postpone implementation of the final rule, exceptfor post-casualty testing, insofar as it would affect foreign pilots andforeign vessels, until January 1, 1990. This will allow for consultationbetween governments about implementation of the requirements of the rule.There are also issues about random tests for employees of U.S. companieswhere the vessels may not return to the U.S. during the year. The companyis required to conduct the tests in international waters, where feasible,or on board the ship within the territorial waters of a foreign countrywhere such testing does not violate the laws of the foreign country. Whereforeign law prohibits the testing of an employee regardless of his location,implementation of the final rule, insofar as it would affect such individuals,is postponed until January 1, 1990, to allow consultations between governments.We have determined not to make the rule applicable in any situation wherecompliance would violate the domestic laws or policies of another country.In addition, because of the potential confusion that may exist involvingapplication of this rule in situations where compliance could violate foreignlaws or policies, we have determined not to make the rule applicable, untilJanuary 1, 1990, in any situation where a foreign government contends thatcompliance with our rule raises questions of compatibility with its domesticlaws or policies. During the next year, the Department of Transportationand other U.S. government officials will be working closely with representativesof foreign governments with the goal of reaching permanent resolution toany conflict between our rule and foreign laws and policies. The U.S. andCanadian Governments have already established a bilateral working groupin an attempt to achieve this objective. We believe that considerable progresshas already been made, and further meetings will be held in the near future.While we believe that this can be a model for addressing the concerns ofother countries, it is not intended to be the exclusive means. The Commandantmay delay the effective date further under this section, if such delayis necessary to permit consultation with any foreign governments to besuccessfully completed.It is the agency's intention to issue a notice no later than December 1,1989, that would make any necessary amendments to the rule as a resultof discussions with foreign governments. Shortly after their issuance,any such notices will be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> While we recognize that this may create someanomalous conditions in competitive situations, it is the intention ofthe U.S. government to make every effort to resolve potential conflictswith foreign governments in a manner that accommodates their concerns whileensuring the necessary level of safety by those we regulate.Section-by-Section AnalysisThis final rule reflects substantial changes to those regulations set forthin the notice of proposed rulemaking. These changes have been made as aresult of the comments received, issues raised during the public hearingsand further review within the Coast Guard.Amendments to Part 4The final rule amends the existing marine casualty and investigation regulationsby adding chemical testing requirements to be followed when commercialvessels are involved in serious marine incidents. To accomplish this, ithas also been necessary to define additional terms utilized in these newregulations.<T3>Section 4.03-2 </T3>defines a serious marine incident. Serious marineincidents differ from marine casualties and accidents. Some occurrencesconsidered reportable marine casualties would not be considered seriousmarine incidents (e.g., suffering vessel damages of $50,000); other occurrencesconsidered serious marine incidents would not be considered reportablemarine casualties (e.g., discharging a reportable quantity of a hazardoussubstance into the navigable waters of the United States).<T3>Section 4.03-4 </T3>defines an individual directly involved in a seriousmarine incident. This rule requires that these individuals be chemicallytested for drug or alcohol use. For an individual to be directly involvedin a serious marine incident, that individual's order, action or failureto act must have been a significant causative factor in the events leadingto or causing a serious marine incident. This would be indicative of humanerror. Chemical testing would be required to determine whether or not suchan error could be a result of drug or alcohol impairment. It is not intendedby these regulations that the master of a vessel, who, by virtue of position,is responsible for the entire vessel, be tested after each serious marineincident in which the vessel may be involved. It is also not the intentof these regulations to necessarily test personnel after each materialfailure which may lead to a serious marine incident (e.g., the helmsmanwho happens to be on duty at the time of a steering gear failure).<T3>Section 4.03-5 </T3>defines a medical facility.<T3>Section 4.03-6 </T3>defines qualified medical personnel.<T3>Section 4.03-7 </T3>defines a chemical test. Although these final rulesrecognize only certain chemical tests of urine, blood and breath to determineevidence of dangerous drug or alcohol use, the definition is written inbroad enough terms to allow for the acceptance of other types of testswhich may be added in subsequent rulemakings.Paragraph (e) of andSection; 4.05-1 has been revised to require the reportingof a marine casualty to the Coast Guard when an injury results which requiresprofessional medical treatment beyond first aid and, in cases involvingcrewmembers, renders an individual unfit to perform routine vessel duties.This varies from the previous requirement which required reporting of injurieswhich incapacitated a person for a period in excess of 72 hours. This eliminatesthe need to report such cases as sprained ankles whereby an individualcould be incapacitiated for over three days and still not require professionalmedical attention.A new Subpart 4.06 is added to address mandatory chemical testing followingserious marine incidents involving vessels in commercial service. Theseregulations extend those contained in 33 CFR Part 95, which require determinationsas to whether alcohol or drugs are involved in marine casualties and allowfor the chemical testing of individuals involved in marine casualties orsuspected of being intoxicated. The regulations in this part require chemicaltesting of individuals directly involved in serious marine incidents.<T3>Section 4.06-1 </T3>outlines the responsibilities of the marine employerfollowing the occurrence of a serious marine incident. A marine employeris first required to make a timely, good faith determination as to whethera marine casualty, discharge of oil, or discharge of a hazardous substanceis, or is likely to become, a serious marine incident. If the employerdetermines that the criteria for a serious marine incident has been, orlikely will be, met, the marine employer shall then determine who, if anyone,abroad the vessel was directly involved in the incident. The marine employershall then take all practicable steps to assure that all persons directlyinvolved in the serious marine incident are chemically tested for evidenceof dangerous drug or alcohol use. A law enforcement officer may determinethat individuals other than those designated by the marine employer shouldalso be designated as being directly involved in the serious marine incident.In such cases, the marine employer must take all practicable steps to testthose individuals also.This section is intended to allow the marine employer to balance the chemicaltesting requirements of this part against the immediate circumstances surroundinga serious marine incident. The need to control a shipboard fire may faroutweigh the necessity to promptly take a breath sample to test for alcoholuse. It may be physically impossible to transport a crewmember directlyivnolved in a serious marine incident abroad a fishing vessel in the Gulfof Alaska to a medical facility where a blood sample can be taken and shippedfor testing. The Coast Guard expects that timely chemical tests will beconducted on every person directly involved in a serious marine incident.It trusts the marine employer to make good faith determinations as to whensuch testing is required, who is required to be tested, and when it ispracticable to do so.The regulations also require the marine employer to indoctrinate all individualsengaged or employed aboard a vessel of these requirements. Personnel assignedfunctions to implement these regulations shall be trained to carry outthose duties as necessary.<T3>Section 4.06-5 </T3>outlines the responsibilities of persons directlyinvolved in serious marine incidents. An individual can be determined tobe directly involved in a serious marine incident by a marine employeror a law enforcement officer. When an individual is directed to undergochemical testing for evidence of drug or alcohol use by the marine employeror the law enforcement officer, the individual is required to comply. However,no individual can be forcibly compelled to comply with these testing requirements.In cases where an individual refuses to submit to chemical testing requiredby this part, an entry will be made in the official log book, if one isrequired to be maintained, and on Form CG-2692B (Report of Required ChemicalDrug and Alcohol Testing Following a Serious Marine Incident). Such a refusalis considered to be a violation of regulation and will subject individualsholding a license, certificate of registry, or merchant marine's documentto suspension and revocation proceedings under 46 CFR Part 5. Individuals,whether or not they hold a license, certificate of registry, or merchantmariner's document, who refuse to submit to testing when directed to doso by their employer or a law enforcement officer will be subject to removalfrom any duties which directly affect the safety of vessel's navigationor operations. There may be instances where personnel would be unable tosubmit to such testing in order to perform duties in the aftermath of aserious marine incident which would be necessary for the preservation oflife or property or the protection of the environment. In such cases, thetesting would have to be delayed or not conducted, as determined necessaryby the marine employer.<T3>Section 4.06-10</T3> specifies what types of specimens must be takento meet the chemical testing requirements of this subpart. Paragraph (a)requires urine specimens to be provided for testing for evidence of dangerousdrug use. Urine specimens must be collected and tested in accordance withthe requirements of andSection; 4.06-20 and 46 CFR Part 16, ``Chemical Testing.''Paragraph (b) allows either blood or breath specimens, or both, to be utilizedto test for evidence of alcohol use. Because alcohol dissipates quicklyfrom a person's system, it is necessary that the specimens be taken assoon as is practicable following the occurrence of a serious marine incident.<T3>Section 4.06-20</T3> establishes requirements for specimen collection.It is extremely important that specimens be obtained as soon as practicablefollowing the occurrence of a serious marine incident, that they are notaltered or tampered with, and that they can be positively tracked fromthe time the specimens are provided until the time they are tested. Toensure this, designated personnel must supervise the collection processand make certain that the proper procedures are followed. Ideally, specimencollection would be overseen by qualified collection personnel or by afirm offering a specimen collection service, either in a designated shoresidefacility or aboard the vessel. Because of the nature of the maritime industry,however, it may be necessary for specimen collections to be carried outin remote locations which would necessitate that trained shipboard personnelcollect specimens. This latter option would only be permitted for urineand breath specimen collections: blood specimens are only permitted tobe taken by qualified medical personnel.Paragraph (a) of this section specifies that a vessel certificated forunrestricted ocean routes and a vessel certificated for restricted overseasroutes carry on board a breath testing device capable of determining thepresence of alcohol in a person's system. The selection of this deviceis left to the discretion of the marine employer. However, the device mustbe used in accordance with the procedures specified by its manufacturer.These devices are not required to be carried on other vessels since theirroutes will, in all likelihood, place them near a medical facility whereblood specimens can be taken, near a law enforcement facility where breathtesting can be conducted, or in a location where the marine employer orthe designated representative can bring testing equipment to the vessel.Paragraph (b) requires that marine employers have urine specimen collectionand shipping kits readily available for use in the collection and shippingof urine specimens following serious marine incidents. These kits neednot be maintained aboard vessels if they can be obtained within 24 hoursof the occurrence of a serious marine incident. The kits must contain allthe items necessary, including written step-by-step procedures to be followed,to ensure that specimens are properly collected and shipped, regardlessof the location at which the collection is accomplished. Specimen collectionand mailing kit requirements are contained in andSection; 16.330.<T3>Section 4.06-30</T3> requires that body fluid specimens be collectedfrom the remains of crewmembers who die as a result of marine casualties.The marine employer is responsible for notifying the appropriate localauthority of this requirement. The marine employer shall make a specimencollection and shipping kit available to the local authority and assistin assuring that the specimen is properly handled and shipped. Recognizingthat there may be instances where the local authority or the custodianof the remains may refuse to allow such specimens to be taken, the regulationspermit the marine employer to explain why the required specimens were notobtained in such cases.<T3>Section 4.06-40</T3> places the burden of ensuring that blood and urinespecimens are properly collected, documented, and shipped upon the marineemployer. Paragraph (a) specifies shipping requirements specific to bloodspecimens, and paragraph (b) specifies requirements for shipment of urinespecimens.<T3>Section 4.06-50</T3> requires testing laboratories to provide promptanalyses of specimens sent to them for testing. The testing laboratoriesare required to send test reports to the Medical Review Officer designatedby the marine employer. The main function of the Medical Review Officeris to ensure that any positive test result is not attributable to a prescribedmedication or some other acceptable reason.Paragraph (c) cautions that a positive test result, by itself, shall notconstitute a finding that the use of drugs or alcohol was the probablecause of a serious marine incident. Such a fact may, however, be consideredas evidence in the investigation of a serious marine incident and may leadto the conclusion that the use of drugs or alcohol was its probable cause.<T3>Section 4.06-60</T3> details the requirements for submittal of chemicaltesting information to the Coast Guard. This is accomplished through theuse of Form CG-2692B (Report of Required Chemical Drug and Alcohol TestingFollowing a Serious Marine Incident). Following the occurrence of a seriousmarine incident, the marine employer is required to submit this form tothe Coast Guard. In cases in which a Form CG-2692 (Report of Marine Accident,Injury or Death) is required to be submitted, the Form CG-2692B shall beappended to it. In cases involving discharges of oil or hazardous substances,where a Form CG-2692 may not be required, the Form CG-2692B shall be submittedto the Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection having jurisdictionover the location where the discharge occurred or nearest the port of thevessel's first arrival following the discharge. The Form CG-2692B requiresthe marine employer to indicate all individuals directly involved in aserious marine incident. These individuals are to provide specimens forchemical testing as required by this subpart. In instances where individualsrefuse to provide required specimens, or where for some reason specimenscannot be obtained, this information shall also be included on the form.The marine employer shall submit a copy of the positive or negative testresults for each person designated as a person directly involved in theserious marine incident to the same Officer in Charge, Marine Inspectionto whom the Form CG-2692B was submitted.Amendments to Part 5<T3>Table 5.569</T3> is revised in the final rule to include a listingfor ``Violation of Regulation: Refusal to provide specimens for requiredchemical test.'' The suggested range of appropriate order to be used forthis violation will be a 12 to 24 month outright suspension of an individual'slicense, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document.Amendments to Subchapter BThe final rule amends Subchapter B, Merchant Marine Officers and Seamen,by adding a new Part 16, Chemical Testing. Part 16 is divided into foursubparts: Subpart A, General; Subpart B, Required Chemical Testing; SubpartC, Standards for Chemical Testing for Dangerous Drugs; and Subpart D, EmployeeAssistance Programs.<T3>Subpart A</T3> of this part contains requirements of a general naturewhich apply to the chemical testing of commercial vessel personnel.<T3>Section 16.101</T3> informs the reader of the purpose of the regulationscontained in this part, i.e., to provide minimum standards, proceduresand means to be used to test for the use of dangerous drugs in order tominimize the use of intoxicants by merchant marine personnel and to promotea drug free and safe work environment.Section 16.101 provides that an employer may test the sample obtained underthis rule only for the drugs required or specifically authorized to betested under the rule. That is, an employer must test the sample for thefive major drugs listed in the regulation. Only if, in the context of reasonablecause testing, the Coast Guard authorizes testing for additional Drug Xunder 49 CFR Part 40 (an approval which would be granted only after consultationwith the Department of Health and Human Services, and only on the basisof a DHHS-established testing protocol and positive threshold) may theemployer also test the sample for that drug.Absent such an approval, if the employer wants to test, in addition, forDrug Y, the employer must obtain a second sample from the employee. Theobtaining of this second sample is not under the authority of these regulations.The employer must base its request for the second sample on whatever otherlegal authority is available, since the employer cannot rely on the CoastGuard regulation as the basis for the request.<T3>Section 16.105</T3> defines several terms utilized in Part 16.<T3>``Chemical test''</T3> is defined in broad enough terms to describevirtually any type of chemical test. Although these final rules authorizeonly certain chemical tests of urine, blood and breath to determine evidenceof dangerous drug or alcohol use, the definition is written to allow forthe acceptance of other types of tests as they are proven to be satisfactory.<T3>``Commitment of employment''</T3> is defined to mean the proof of employmentrequired by 46 CFR 12.25-5.<T3>``Crewmember'',</T3> as used in this part, is an important term asit defines vessel personnel to whom the regulations of this part apply.The intent of these regulations is to chemically test all individuals engagedor employed aboard a vessel who perform duties which directly affect thesafety of the vessel or its operations. This definition states that anyoneaboard a vessel who is acting under the authority of a license, certificateof registry, or merchant mariner's document issued under this subchapter,whether or not a member of the vessel's crew, is subject to the requirementsof this part. The wording is used to include individuals such as federalpilots who operate aboard a vessel, but are technically not a member ofthe vessel's crew. While not members of the vessel's crew, they are aboardserving a function, albeit temporary, which can directly affect the safetyof the vessel. It is therefore necessary for them to be subject to thesechemical testing requirements. The second part of this definition statesthat anyone engaged or employed to perform duties aboard a United Statesvessel which is required by law or regulation to be operated by an individualholding a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's documentissued under this subchapter which directly affects the safety of the vesselor its operations is similarly subject to the requirements of this part.Thus, state pilots, certain industrial personnel, and undocumented crewmemberswould all be subject to the requirements of this part. Certain of theseregulations do not apply to individuals employed aboard a small passengervessel such as waiters, waitresses, bartenders, and musicians who haveno duties directly affecting the safety of the vessel. Scientific personnelaboard oceanographic research vessels and individuals primarily employedin the preparation of fish or fish products on fish processing vesselsare also excluded from certain testing requirements.<T3>``Dangerous drug''</T3> is defined.<T3>``Dangerous drug level''</T3> is defined.<T3>``Employer''</T3> is defined to include both marine employers and sponsoringorganizations, as described below. Many of the regulations in this partrefer to employers, vice marine employers. In such cases, marine employersmay utilize sponsoring organizations to fulfill specified regulatory responsibilities.<T3>``Fails a chemical test for dangerous drugs''</T3> is defined.<T3>``Intoxicant''</T3> is defined to include any form of alcohol, dangerousdrug, or combination thereof.<T3>``Marine employer''</T3> is broadly defined to mean a vessel's owner,managing operator, charter, agent, master, or person in charge. Many ofthe regulations in this part pertain specifically to the marine employer.Who specifically executes the regulatory requirement will often dependon the circumstances of a given situation. Where doubt exists as to whowill carry out a particular regulatory requirement, written company guidanceshould be provided.<T3>``Medical Review Officer''</T3> is an individual designated by theemployer to carry out the duties specified in 46 CFR 16.370. This individualmay be employed directly by the employer, or may be provided for as partof a contracted drug testing program.<T3>``Serious marine incident''</T3> is defined as in 46 CFR 4.03-2.<T3>``Sponsoring organization''</T3> is broadly defined to include companies,consortiums, corporations, associations, unions, or other organizationswith which marine employers or their employees are associated. Many ofthe regulations in this part refer to employers, vice marine employers.In such cases, sponsoring organizations can be used to fulfill the specifiedregulatory responsibilities.<T3>``Vessel owned in the United States''</T3> is defined.<T3>Subpart B</T3> of this part delineates the type of required chemicaltesting.<T3>Section 16.201</T3> emphasizes that chemical testing of personnel mustbe conducted. Any user who fails a chemical test for dangerous drugs isconsidered to be a user of dangerous drugs. The employer or prospectiveemployer of an individual who fails to pass a required chemical test mustdeny that individual employment in, or remove him or her as soon as practicablefrom duties which directly affect the safety of the vessel's navigationor operations. If an individual holds a license, certificate of registry,or merchant mariner's document and fails to pass a required chemical test,the employer or prospective employer must report the test results to thenearest Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. The individual will thenbe subject to suspension and revocation proceedings against his or herlicense, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document under46 CFR Part 5.Paragraph (e) of this section permits individuals who have failed a requiredchemical test to be rehired, provided requirements outlined elsewhere inthe regulations have been fulfilled.<T3>Section 16.205</T3> establishes a graduated implementation scale foremployers to come into compliance with the requirements of this part. Agraduated scale is provided to allow smaller employers time to form associationsor other similar sponsoring organizations, if they so choose, to overseecertain testing aspects required by these regulations and enable them toobtain reduced group testing rates at certified testing laboratories.Marine employers who employ more than 50 employees subject to the requirementsof this part are given six months after the effective date of this ruleto implement a pre-employment testing program and one year to implementthe remainder of the drug testing program.Marine employers who employ from 11 to 50 employees subject to the requirementsof this part are given one year after the effective date of this rule toimplement the pre-employment, periodic, post-accident, reasonable cause,and after return to duty testing programs. They must establish random testingprograms within two years after the effective date of this rule.Marine employers who employ 10 or fewer employees subject to the requirementsof this part are given two years after the effective date of this ruleto implement a complete anti-drug program which fully complies with theseregulations.Paragraph (d) allows random testing programs to be gradually brought intoeffect over an extended time period of one year. As discussed earlier inthis preamble, it may be a substantial burden for employers to move immediatelyfrom no drug testing to a 50-percent random testing rate. This paragraphspecifies the graduated steps which will be permitted in the implementationof random testing programs.Paragraph (f) is written to clarify that foreign pilots aboard U.S. vesselsoperating in waters not subject to the jurisdiction of the United Statesdo not have to meet the testing requirements of this part.<T3>Section 16.207 </T3>addresses conflicts with foreign laws. As discussedpreviously in this preamble, some foreign laws may prohibit testing oftheir citizens. This section delays implementation of the testing requirementsof this part with respect to foreign citizens aboard U.S. vessels in orderthat agreements can be pursued with foreign governments to clarify thispoint.<T3>Section 16.210 </T3>requires that no one be engaged, employed or otherwisegiven a commitment of employment as a crewmember aboard a vessel unlessthat individual passes a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The burdenrests upon the marine employer to ensure that this requirement is met.The pre-employment test may be waived if the individual can prove thathe or she has passed a pre-employment or periodic chemical test withinthe previous six months or if the individual can prove that he or she hasbeen subject to an accepted random testing program for not less than twelvemonths, has not failed a chemical test for dangerous drugs, and has notrefused to participate in required chemical tests. The wording of thissection relieves the employer of the burden of pre-employment testing byallowing the hiring of individuals through sponsoring organizations, e.g.,unions, which conduct pre-employment and random tests in accordance withthese regulations of their members prior to their being assigned a shipboardbillet.<T3>Section 16.220 </T3>specifies that a chemical test for dangerous drugsmust be conducted whenever a physical examination is required by regulationscontained elsewhere in this subchapter. If a physical examination is requiredfor a license or merchant mariner's document, the applicant must providethe results of the chemical test to the Coast Guard Regional ExaminationCenter (REC). When the regulations require a license holder to undergophysical examinations on a periodic basis, the results of each requiredchemical test must be provided to the REC by the individual at the timeof license renewal.If an individual can prove that he or she has passed a pre-employment chemicaltest within the previous six months or if the individual can prove thathe or she has been subject to an accepted random testing program for notless than twelve months, has not failed a chemical test for dangerous drugs,and has not refused to participate in required chemical tests, a periodicchemical test need not be conducted.<T3>Section 16.230 </T3>requires marine employers to provide for the chemicaltesting of crewmembers on a random basis. As has been discussed previously,marine employers may form or otherwise use sponsoring organizations toconduct their random chemical testing programs.Employers must test crewmembers on a random basis at an annual rate ofnot less than 50 percent. Every member of a given population must havea substantially equal chance of selection to be tested on a scientificallyvalid basis. The basis of selection is left to the employer. Employersmay choose to test individuals; employers may choose to test entire units.The important consideration is that the testing frequency and process usedin such that an individual employee's chances of selection remain constantthroughout his or her employment. Employees may not receive a prewarningof when they are to be randomly tested.It is important to note that the requirements of this section apply toindividuals such as independent tankermen, federal pilots, state pilots,and certain industrial personnel. While not members of the vessel's crew,they are aboard serving a function, albeit temporary, which can directlyaffect the safety of the vessel or its operations. It is therefore necessaryfor them to be subject to these chemical testing requirements. Becausesuch individuals commonly work for or through ``third parties'', e.g.,pilot's associations or drilling companies, and are not properly employeesof the marine employer, it is incumbent upon the marine employer to ensurethat these individuals are either tested under programs established bytheir employer or association, or are tested under the marine employer'sestablished program.Paragraph (d) forbids anyone from serving as master, operator, or personin charge on a vessel in a position for which a license or merchant mariner'sdocument is required unless all crewmembers are subject to the random testingrequirements of this section. Doing so could result in suspension and revocationproceedings being initiated against the individual. This change was madebecause it is unreasonable to expect that all holders of licenses or merchantmariner's documents aboard a vessel be cognizant of who is and who is notin compliance with the testing procedures of this section. The master,operator, or person in charge, however, should be.<T3>Section 16.240 </T3>requires that all individuals directly involvedin a serious marine incident be chemically tested for the presence of dangerousdrugs and alcohol in accordance with the requirements of 46 CFR 4.06.<T3>Section 16.250 </T3>requires an employer to chemically test crewmembersfor dangerous drug use when there is reasonable cause to suspect such usage.The decision to test in such circumstances should be based on the observationand concurrence of two persons in supervisory positions, wherever practicable.Whenever such testing is conducted, it shall be logged in the vessel'sofficial log book, if one is required. If an individual refuses to submitor cooperate in the administration of a timely chemical test when directedto do so, this fact shall also be entered in the vessel's official logbook. In the case of licensed or documented personnel, this will subjectthe individual to suspension and revocation proceeding under 46 CFR Part5.<T3>Section 16.260 </T3>requires employers to maintain records of chemicaltests performed. These records must be sufficient to provide evidence ofthe results of chemical tests of crewmembers to satisfy andSection;andSection;16.210(b) and 16.220(b). Additionally, the records must be sufficientlydetailed so as to permit collection and analysis of the effectiveness ofthe testing programs. Negative report records must be retained for oneyear. Positive report rcords must be maintained for five years. These recordsmust be made available to Coast Guard officials upon request.<T3>Subpart C </T3>establishes the standards to be met when chemicallytesting for dangerous drugs.<T3>Section 16.301 </T3>requires that drug testing programs subject tothis part be conducted in a manner consistent with 49 CFR Part 40, Proceduresfor Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs. These regulations arebased upon ``Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs,''developed by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS Guidelines).These were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 11, 1988. This section cautions readersthat the regulations in this subpart are summaries of the requirementscontained in 49 CFR Part 40. In establishing specific procedures to carryout the requirements of this part, those regulations should be consulted.<T3>Section 16.310 </T3>provides the employer with general guidance inthe establishment of specimen collection procedures. It stresses principalissues which must be considered during program development (general collectionsite requirements, security of the collection site, access to the collectionsite by authorized personnel only, privacy of individuals providing specimens,and maintaining the integrity of specimens after they are given). Specificrequirements for these aspects of a testing program are found in 49 CFRPart 40, and these regulations should be consulted to ensure program adequacy.<T3>Section 16.320 </T3>requires that a chain of custody be establishedfor each specimen provided for chemical testing. It is extremely importantthat each specimen can always be accounted for, from the time it is providedthrough its authorized disposition. A properly established chain of custodyensures that the chances of a specimen being altered, contaminated, switched,or lost are minimized and that test results provided are, in actuality,those of the indicated specimen.<T3>Section 16.330</T3> establishes specimen handling and shipping procedures.The regulations require the employer to obtain a specimen collection andshipping kit to be used to collect specimens and return them to the certifieddrug testing laboratory. Items required to be provided in the specimencollection and shipping kit are specified. The list is not all-inclusive,and additional items may be included as the employer considers necessary.It is imagined that the employer will work closely with the chosen drugtesting laboratory in developing this kit. One important feature of thekit is the set of step-by-step instructions which describe the proper proceduresto be followed during specimen collection, handling, and shipping. Becausesituations are envisioned where specimen collection may be supervised bypersonnel not overly familiar with these procedures, the specimen collectioninstructions must be written in a manner which is easily understandableand will result in the specimens being properly provided, stored, handled,and shipped to the testing laboratory.<T3>Section 16.340 </T3>requires that laboratories used to conduct thechemical tests required by this part be DHHS certified. The burden is placedupon the employer to ensure that this requirement is met.<T3>Section 16.350 </T3>requires that each specimen be analyzed in a mannerconsistent with 49 CFR 40.24. DHHS certified laboratories will meet thisrequirement. It also specifies the dangerous drugs for which each specimenmust be tested and defines when a specimen is considered to have testedpositive. Specimens which indicate the presence of a dangerous drug inexcess of the levels established in 49 CFR 40.24 shall be reported to theMedical Review Officer as positive.<T3>Section 16.360 </T3>describes the information which must be includedon each specimen analysis report. Only specimens tested as positive onthe confirmatory test are to be listed as positive on the specimen analysisreport. Samples which are negative on the screening test and specimenswhich are negative on the confirmatory test shall be reported as negativeon the specimen analysis report. All specimen analysis reports shall besent to the Medical Review Officer designated by the employer, rather thanto the employer.<T3>Section 16.370</T3> requires employers to designate or appoint a MedicalReview Officer (MRO). The primary function of the MRO is to review andinterpret each confirmed positive test in order to detemine if there isan alternative medical explanation for a positive test result. The MROmay be employed directly by the employer, or the provision of MRO servicesmay be contracted as part of the drug testing program. The MRO verifiespositive test results through interviews with the crewmember who testedpositive, reviews of the crewmember's medical history and biomedical factors,and verification of the laboratory report and assessment. The MRO may,if he or she considers it necessary, request the original specimen be reanalyzedto determine the accuracy of the reported test result.The MRO provides the final report to the employer or the employer's designatedagent. The MRO may determine there is a legitimate medical explanationfor a confirmed positive test result that is consistent with legal druguse. In such cases the MRO shall report a test result as negative. TheMRO may conclude, based on reviews of laboratory inspection reports, qualityassurance and quality control data, and other drug test results, that aparticular drug test result is insufficient for further action. In suchcases the MRO shall also report a test result as negative. If the MRO determinesthat there is no legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positivetest result that is consistent with legal drug use, the MRO shall reportthe positive test result to the employer for further proceedings in accordancewith the employer's anti-drug program.The MRO also determines when an individual who has failed a chemical drugtest for dangerous drugs may return to work. The decision is made afterthe MRO determines that the individual is drug-free and the risk of subsequentuse of dangerous drugs by that person is sufficiently low to justify hisor her return to work.<T3>Section 16.380</T3> mandates that employers shall not release individualtest results or other personal information from anti-drug program recordsexcept: to the Coast Guard where required by these regulations, to specificallyidentified persons designated by the individual tested, or personally tothe individual tested.<T3>Subpart D </T3>specifies the requirements of employee assistance programs.<T3>Section 16.401</T3> requires employers to provide an Employee AssistanceProgram (EAP) for all crewmembers. The employer may establish the EAP aspart of its internal personnel service program or the employer may contractwith an entity that will provide EAP to a crewmember. The EAP must containan education program and a training program for all personnel. At least60 minutes of EAP training must be provided for each supervisor.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures</ITAG>These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291. However, they are considered to be significant under the DOT regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11304; February 26, 1979) because they initiatea substantial regulatory program.The Coast Guard has prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket a finalregulatory evaluation addressing the economic impact of these rules. Itmay be inspected or copied at the Marine Safety Council, Room 3600, U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001,from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>The Coast Guard has developed a final regulatory impact analysis and placedit in the docket. As previously stated, the estimated overall cost of implementingthese regulations will be a maximum of $9.22 million during the third yearof implementation to a constantly recurring annual cost of $7.20 millionafter the fifth year. Although revisions to the vessel casualty reportingprogram have recently been effected, existing data does not readily identifydrug-related casualties. Therefore, the Coast Guard has not estimated thetotal cost benefits of this rulemaking. However, the following must bekept in mind.In 1984 there were approximately 2300 commercial vessel casualties (excludingfishing vessels), resulting in $237 million in damages and 68 deaths. Ofthese, 1133 of the accidents were directly attributable to personnel-relatedcauses, i.e. carelessness, misjudgment, etc., resulting in $77 millionin damages and 29 deaths. (It should be noted that these statistics donot include personnel deaths or injuries which were not associated withvessel accidents.) According to a 1987 NIDA report on Strategic Planningfor Workplace Drug Abuse Programs, abusers of drugs and alcohol have 3.6times as many accidents in comparison to other workers. There is no reasonto believe a similar correlation does not exist in the maritime industry.On that basis, it would be reasonable to assume that detecting 7.5 percentdrug users in the employee population would have the potential for preventingup to 27 percent (3.6 andmultiply; 7.5%) of the accidents attributable topersonnel-related causes. If 27 percent of the $77 million in damages and29 deaths attributable to personnel-related causes is prevented some $20.8million in damages and eight deaths could be prevented. (Additional savingswould also be achieved as a result of reduced compensation claims, lowermedical costs, and less time lost due to sick leave.)The Coast Guard believes that if drug screening can prevent even a lowpercentage of accidents through drug testing and rehabilitation, the programwill more than pay for itself. Using the minimum accepted value of a humanlife of one million dollars, the saving of but a few lives annually, alongwith reduced property damage, will more than match the cost of the program.This goal is believed achievable, given the success of other drug testingprograms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires review of proposed rulesto assess their impact on small business. In consideration of the costinformation discussion under the regulatory analysis, the Coast Guard concludesthat this final rule could have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entites. The Coast Guard has provided viable alternativesfor small employers to adopt which would reduce the cost of compliancewhile achieving the levels of protection sought by these rules. Althoughunit costs for small entities for certain services required under theseregulations may be somewhat higher, small operators have the latitude toutilize cooperative services, or form associations, which will result ina reduction of unit costs. A regulatory flexibility analysis discussingthis issue in more detail has been placed in the docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rulemaking contains information collection requirements in the followingsections: Part 16, subparts B and C, plus section 46 CFR 4.06. These collectionrequirements are being submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq.).Under andSection; 4.06-60, the employer is required to submit a Form CG-2692B(Report of Required Chemical Drug and Alcohol Testing Following a SeriousMarine Incident) to the Coast Guard whenever personnel are directed toprovide specimens for mandatory chemical testing after the occurrence ofa serious marine incident. Employers are also required to maintain recordsof the results of chemical testing for dangerous drugs under andSection;16.260.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>This regulation has been analyzed in accordance with the principles andcriteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The rules affectthe safety of vessels in interstate and foreign commerce and are directlyrelated to the qualifications of personnel licensed by the U.S. Coast Guardand their working conditions on vessels. These are express statutory responsibilitiesof the U.S. Coast Guard and there are no similar State responsibilitiesor programs in these areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulationsand concluded that, under section 2.B.2.1. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B,they will have no significant environmental impact and are categoricallyexcluded from further environmental documentation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>46 CFR Part 4Administrative practice and procedures, Investigations, Accidents, Marinesafety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Alcohol and alcoholicbeverages, Drugs.46 CFR Part 5Administrative practice and procedures, Investigations, Administrativelaw judge, Investigating officer, Seamen, License, Certificate, Document,Administrative hearings, Navigation (Water), Suspension and revocation,Marine safety, Alcohol and alcoholic beverages, Drugs.46 CFR Part 16Seamen, Marine safety, Navigation (Water), Alcohol and alcoholic beverages,Drugs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 46, Chapter I, of the Codeof Federal Regulations, is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 4_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
