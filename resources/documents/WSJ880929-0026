The Sterling, Ill., steel company said its board has approved the plan, which includes the acquisition and modernization of the plant, which will produce wide-flange beams. The cost was put at about $150 million.    The company said it obtained a leasehold interest and initiated some construction at the site in June 1987. Northwestern has been trying to acquire the plant for more than two years but completion of the purchase has been delayed.    Northwestern said it is working to arrange financing for the acquisition, which should be completed by Dec. 31.    Armco is a Parsippany, N.J.-based steel concern. </TEXT></DOC>
