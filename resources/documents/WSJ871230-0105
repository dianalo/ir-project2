In addition to about $1.1 billion of so-called junk bonds, the Tampa, Fla.-based home-building company is marketing a private placement of about $1.3 billion of securities backed by the mortgages on company-built homes. The financing would replace a $2.3 billion bank line arranged when the company went private last September in a leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., New York.    By halving the amount of junk bonds the company needs to sell, noted one investment banker, the asset-backed securities could smooth the path of the whole financing package. Noting Southland Corp.'s recent troubles in placing $1.5 billion of junk bonds, he said a $2.4 billion chunk of such securities probably would be impossible to sell in the current market climate. Junk bonds are high-yielding securities that are rated below investment grade.    The junk-bond market, badly shaken by the Oct. 19 stock market crash, is still encountering investor uncertainty, especially regarding companies that, like Jim Walter and Southland, were taken private at pre-crash prices. The Jim Walter offering also includes an element that gave Southland some problems -- deferred interest payments.    The Southland financing had to be restructured to attract investors. But so far, the Jim Walter offering is going ahead with only minor revisions. Investors generally seem enthusiastic about the company. They say the bonds probably will find buyers, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Jim Walter's investment banker, is trying to wrap up the deal before the end of the year.    Speed is of the essence, as both Jim Walter and Drexel are working under deadlines. The interest rate on some of the bank loans jumps 2 1/2 percentage points Jan. 18, and the bank financing expires three months later. For its part, Drexel is committed to a $1.1 billion bridge loan if it doesn't sell the junk bonds by the time Kohlberg Kravis completes the final details of its acquisition of Jim Walter, expected by next March.    In a leveraged buy-out, investors finance an acquisition largely with debt that eventually is repaid from operations or the sale of assets.    Drexel is approaching a different set of investors, primarily insurance companies, for the asset-backed part of the plan. Currently, the firm is working with a group of potential lead investors that are expected to take from half to 80% of the asset-backed securities. Key to the financing's success is Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which is considering taking well over a quarter of the securities, sources said. Prudential put together a team of officials to study the plan, but hasn't yet made a commitment, they added. Prudential officials declined to comment.    The asset-backed securities, which Drexel officials expect to meet rating-concern standards for a single-A, investment-grade rating, are expected to carry a yield substantially below that on the junk-bond portion of the package, cutting the overall cost.    Terms of the offering haven't yet been set, but sources said that early in the negotiations, Drexel was suggesting yields on the asset-backed securities ranging from 1 1/4 to 2 1/4 percentage points above those on Treasury securities of similar maturities. Though the final yields will probably be higher, they should still be substantially below junk-bond yields.    If Drexel can line up Prudential and a handful of other major investors, sources said, the financing should be relatively smooth. But if they balk, the firm might have to turn to other techniques to complete the transaction.    Drexel has been talking to Financial Security Assurance, a bond-insurance firm, about buying a policy that would boost the rating to a triple-A. William Jacobs, an executive vice president at Financial Security, said that the firm has recommended a public, triple-A-rated offering, but that he expects Drexel to try to market the financing privately first.    Despite the uncertainties, officials at Drexel and elsewhere are enthusiastic about using asset-backed securities in financing other buy-outs. James Vaughan, a first vice president at the firm, declined to discuss details of the Jim Walter or other deals, but did say Drexel is working with another client on a leveraged buy-out financed by securities backed by consumer receivables. &quot;I think there are other opportunities,&quot; he added. &quot;Everybody has receivables.&quot;    Especially in an uncertain economic climate, it makes sense to use financial assets to finance a buy-out, asserted Stephen J. Albert, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. Mr. Albert, who now follows junk bonds, used to track Jim Walter as an equity analyst.    Because investors in asset-backed securities look to the cash flow from the assets for their security, he explained, they don't need to worry as much as junk-bond investors would about how the company will deal with changing economic conditions.    One industry official who has analyzed the financing said it is structured so that the company &quot;can survive without selling assets.&quot; But if necessary, he added, Jim Walter has several subsidiaries apart from its basic home-building business that are &quot;very salable.&quot;    Nonetheless, potential investors have been looking hard at the company's financial viability, as Jim Walter will continue to service the loans once the securities are sold. &quot;It's a very service-intensive type of loan,&quot; said an official at one insurance company considering investing in the transaction. &quot;Somebody's going to have to be able to coordinate the servicing.&quot;    The average balance of the loans backing the securities is only $25,000. Jim Walter's customers are largely middle-income and low-income rural residents. The company gives home buyers a 10% mortgage with no cash down payment -- the buyer's equity is his land and labor.    But the unusual structure of the mortgages also makes it hard to design a security that investors are comfortable with. &quot;They don't have loan-to-value information,&quot; noted a source close to the deal, &quot;and they don't have the documentation that's required on traditional loans.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
