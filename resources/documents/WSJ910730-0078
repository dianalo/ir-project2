Convex's stock was quoted at $10, down $2, in late NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading after a SalomonBrothers analyst cut his rating to &quot;sell&quot; from hold and aHambrecht andamp; Quist analyst lowered his rating to &quot;hold&quot; from&quot;buy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Convex's stock fell $2.25, or about 16% on Friday when thecompany reported a wider-than-expected second-quarter loss of$1.4 million, or 6 cents a share. The company attributed theresults to a weak economy, price competition and transitionin its product line. It also said it expected equally poorresults in the third quarter, but was hoping for improvementin the fourth quarter, when new products are to be shipped inlarger numbers.   The maker of supercomputers told analysts in a conferencecall Friday that it expects to ship six mid-range C3400systems in the third quarter and more than 20 systems in thefourth quarter. Although a spokesman said the company hadn'tdisclosed specific planned shipments before, the numbersapparently disappointed analysts.   Convex said that it has discovered problems with thecomputers' memory management systems when some applicationsare run and said it is modifying the C3400's compiler andoperating system. The spokesman said the problem &quot;is anon-issue for 75%&quot; of the applications that Convex hastargeted for the machine.   The company also said it plans to ship its first new,high-end C3800 in September. Convex said it doesn't have asmany specialty chips for the C3800 and C3400 as it needs, inpart because it has made design changes that have slowedproduction of the chips.</TEXT></DOC>
