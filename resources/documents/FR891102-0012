The Rulemaking</ITAG>This rulemaking does not impose emission measurement requirements beyondthose specified in the current regulations, nor does it change any emissionstandard. Rather, the rulemaking would simply amend two existing test methodsassociated with emission measurement requirements that would apply irrespectiveof this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Participation</ITAG>The opportunity to hold a public hearing on October 24, 1988, at 10:00a.m., was presented in the proposal notice, but no one desired to makean oral presentation. The public comment period was from September 7, 1988,to November 21, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Significant Comments and Changes to the Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Three comment letters were received from the proposal of the rulemaking.The major comments and responses are summarized in this preamble. The commentletters contained multiple comments. The significant comments and subsequentmethod changes are listed here.1. Several comments centered around the proposed repositioning of the scrubberbehind the probe which would also serve as a moisture trap and allow deletionof the heated sample line and dilution system. It was felt that a varietyof alternative methods of moisture removal such as the traditional heatedsample system, dilution with dry air to lower the dew point, or permeationdryers should be included to preclude making the methods overly restrictive.One commenter suggested that references to sample dilution and moisturecontent in the procedures, diagrams, and calculations be retained for thosetesters who prefer to continue to use a dilution system.The repositioning of the scrubber was intended to add sampling convenienceby eliminating unnecessary components which themselves could introducesampling errors. In addition to its removal of interferences and moistureat an initial sampling point, the added benefits include neither havingto heat the sample line, use a dilution system, nor determine moisture.Notwithstanding, some testers, due to equipment that is already in place,may prefer the traditional practice of preventing moisture condensationduring sampling with subsequent sample correction for its presence. Thisprocedure is still acceptable. Alternative methods are also allowed providedother criteria within the methods are met. This is stated in the introductoryparagraph to the method. To make this acceptability criteria more specific,the paragraph will be amended to require that alternative equipment andprocedures meet the calibration and post-test criteria stated in each methods.References throughout the methods to sample dilution and moisture contentwill be deleted except where critical to sampling and calculation needs.2. Two commenters thought the specifications for the citrate scrubber wereunnecessarily restrictive and may be rigidly enforced by regulatory agencyobservers. It was felt that most scrubbers made with glass or Teflon impingersin series, with the first two containing citrate buffer, would be capableof removing interferences. The mention of monitoring the scrubber pH between5.4 and 5.6 was thought to be unnecessary.The introductory paragraphs to the methods allow acceptable variationsto the scrubber design. It should be noted, however, that sample lossesmay be incurred from using glass impingers. Deviations from the prescribedscrubber volumes and impinger sizes may also hinder performance and resultin unacceptable post-test checks. We agree that the statement mentioningpH monitoring should be deleted. The scrubber is normally replaced aftereach 3-hour run, and drastic pH variations are not anticipated for theduration of single run. Unusual cases of sample losses due to pH increasefrom alkali mist and moisture collection would be detected in the line-losstest after the run.3. All commenters questioned the availability of ``NBS-traceable'' line-lossgas and ``certified'' permeation devices proposed for calibration. It waspreferred that permeation devices ``of known permeation rates'' be usedfor calibration and line-loss gases be calibrated against these devicesor by the procedure in Section 7 of Method 16A.We agree with the commenters on these points since no standardized NBS-traceablegases or certified permeation devices currently exist.4. It was brought to our attention that passing diluent air over hydrogensulfide (H<T2>2S</T2>) permeation tubes causes oxidation of liquid H<T2>2</T2>S inside the tubes. This, in turn, affects the measured permeationrate. It was also noted that calibration gases of H<T2>2</T2>S in air are unstable. These will be remedied by specifying thatnitrogen be used in place of air as the diluent for permeation devicesand standard gases. 5. The revision to remove the need for recalibration if a subsquent line-losstest is 10 percent or less was criticized. It was felt that system recoveryand instrument calibration drift should remain as separate measurementsof system accuracy. This way, any periodic sample losses caused by componentinteractions and changes in analyzer sensitivity due to detector gas flowsor column degradation can be separately accounted for. It was also recommendedthat the calibration drift specification cover periods shorter than 24hours. This would prevent confusion and inaccuracy in those cases whererecalibration is needed at shorter intervals. We agree that calibration drift and line-loss tests should remain as separatetests. This would also eliminate the possibility of achieving an acceptablecombined test when the individual drift and line-loss errors are unacceptablebut of comparable magnitude and direction. It will be stated that calibrationdrift measurements be made after each run or series of runs within a 24-hourperiod. 6. The commenters felt the components used in the dilution system and rotarygas valves should be composed of inert materials instead of strictly Teflon.Although Teflon is relatively inert, it offers poor dimensional stabilitywhen used in the dilution system, especially when heated. This could potentiallylead to leaks and changes in flow rates. Rotary valves made of Teflon werenot believed to be commercially available. This change will be made with the dilution system for the stated reasons.A study of the sample dilution system has indicated that glass and stainless-steelcomponent parts are acceptable. Teflon-lined rotary valves are commerciallyavailable and should be used. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Administrative </ITAG>The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information consideredby EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The docket is a dynamic file,since material is added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketingsystem is intended to allow members of the public and industries involvedto identify readily and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process. Along with the statement of basis and purposeof the proposed and promulgated test method revisions and EPA responsesto significant comments, the contents of the docket, except for interagencyreview materials, will serve as the record in case of judicial review [Section307(d)(7)(A)].Under Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether a regulationis a ``major rule'' and, therefore, subject to the requirements of a regulatoryimpact analysis. The Agency has determined that this regulation would resultin none of the adverse economic effects set forth in Section 1 of the Orderas grounds for finding a regulation to be a ``major rule.'' The Agencyhas, therefore, concluded that this regulation is not a ``major rule''under Executive Order 12291.The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires the identificationof potentially adverse impacts of Federal regulations upon small businessentities. The Act specifically requires the completion of an RFA analysisin those instances where small business impacts are possible. Because thisrulemaking imposes no adverse economic impacts, an analysis has not beenconducted. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thepromulgated rule will not have an impact on small entities because no additionalcosts will be incurred. This rule does not change any information collection requirements currentlyapproved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3> Information requirements contained in 40 CFR part 60,Appendix A are cleared under OMB Control Number 2060-0022. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Petroleum refineries,Kraft pulp mills, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and Incorporationby reference.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
