But when Tower wanted the job of defense secretary, his formercolleagues turned on him viciously and drummed him out of publicservice.   Tower's heinous crime (besides being a conservative) was thatreports about drunkenness and skirt-chasing dogged his tracks tooclosely, and the ``appearance'' of immoderate behavior doomed him.   Now let's shift our focus to the U.S. House of Representatives,presided over by one Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas and third in lineof succession to the presidency.   Want to talk about ``appearances?''   How does it look when Wright ... takes a staggering 55 percentroyalty on the sale of his vapid book, most of the copies of whichwere sold in bulk to those noted literary critics, the Teamstersunion, a heavy contributor to guess who's campaigns?   What ``appearance'' is given when the speaker of the Housepublicly blabs classified details of CIA activity in Nigaragua? ...   The House Ethics Committee _ after nine long months offoot-dragging _ is finally poised to release its findings (about)... Wright.   If the Democrats in the Senate felt secure in bludgeoning ...Tower for exhibiting the ``appearance'' of immoderate behavior, thenCongress should seek Wright's scalp if the Ethics Committeediscovers not ``apparent'' but actual improprieties.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 17   West Central Tribune, Willmar, Minn., on assault rifles:   Banning the import of assault rifles is not going to preventanother random massacre. There ... always will be people who woulddo such a thing, if not with an assault rifle, by any other means.   This is getting close to the National Rifle Association'sargument that ``guns don't kill people, people kill people.''   This is true, but Patrick Purdy, who rampaged through theStockton, Calif., school yard on Jan. 17 with an assault rifle,killing five children before turning a pistol on himself, neverwould have been able to inflict such tragedy had he been armed witha knife, a baseball bat, or even a less devastating firearm.   Americans do not want to see the right to bear arms severelylimited, but there is growing public sentiment against assaultrifles and similar deadly firearms.   The NRA, which usually lashes out blindly against any perceivedattack on the right to bear arms, should be a good citizen and takethe lead in clamping down on semiautomatic military weapons. It willhelp one of its most prominent members achieve the goal of a``kinder, gentler nation.''</TEXT><TEXT>   March 18   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on restructuring Sovietagriculture:   Mikhail Gorbachev's plan for restructuring Soviet agriculture isbeing hailed as the greatest thing since canned caviar.   Even the Communist Party Central Committee and the rulingPolitburo, whose usual approach to change is as cool as a Siberianfrost, have warmed to the proposed privatization. ...   The linchpin in the reform is long-term leasing of state-ownedland. Under ... Gorbachev's bold initiative, private farmers wouldbe allowed to lease state land for life _ at present 15 years is thelimit _ and pass it on to their children. ...   The driving force behind this hard turn toward privatization isthe crushing need to increase productivity. Under the Marxist system..., food production has lagged to the point where shortages havebecome the rule.   If the Gorbachev plan is given an honest trial _ which it may notbe, if past reform efforts are any gauge _ the Kremlin may discoverwhat everyone else already knows: that capitalism is not all bad.Until then, Soviet farmers must be thankful for half a loaf, in thefat years.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 16   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on freedom of expression:   Some notably fatuous behavior garnered much publicity for theradio talk show host Tom Leykis of KFI-AM in Los Angeles.   This piece of folly demonstrated abysmal failure to grasp theprinciple of free expression, though Leykis conspicously benefits bythat freedom in his work. He besmeared it with a goonish act ofdestruction.   The popular musician Cat Stevens, who became a Muslim convert adecade ago and changed his name to Yousuf Islam, appears to haveendorsed the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fanatical death sentencepronounced against Salman Rushdie because of his novel ``The SatanicVerses.''   Leykis chose to respond by getting together a batch of CatStevens records and tapes and crunching them with a steamroller. Themessage, he said, was ... ``We endorse the right of the Americanpeople to read, think and say whatever they want to.''   Bravo! But those fine words were perhaps unwittingly rejected thenext moment when the man ... ceremoniously destroyed records andtapes which ... exemplified intellectual freedom.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
