American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. had contested MCI's service on the grounds that MCI had agreed to pay Spain's monopoly telephone company, Telefonica, an accounting rate at a substantial premium over ATandamp;T service and that MCI hadn't submitted necessary FCC disclosures and a waiver request. ATandamp;T complained that Spain was trying to force the company into paying a higher accounting rate, too.    The commission rejected MCI's argument that its service from Spain was substantially different from ATandamp;T's, and ordered MCI to file revisions to its plan with the agency by Sept. 5. Under the service, a customer with an MCI credit card could place a call from any phone in Spain to a U.S. operator who would complete the call. ATandamp;T's service, USA-DIRECT, is available from only a few special phones. A spokeswoman for MCI had no comment. </TEXT></DOC>
