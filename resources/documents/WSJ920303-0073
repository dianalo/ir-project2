However, the projection in its Current Market Outlookreport -- that world-wide air travel will grow at an annualrate of 5.2% through 2010 -- follows a 1991 prediction thatwas far too optimistic about last year.</LP><TEXT>   In the 1992 outlook, a widely watched prediction ofdemand, Seattle-based Boeing extended the 5.2% annual-growthestimate that it last year applied through 2005. If accurate,it means annual airline traffic world-wide will triple by2010. Over the 18-year period, Boeing predicted, about 11,678jetliners will be sold at a total value of $857 billion.   It suggested that the 1991 downturn in air travel was a&quot;short-term deviation&quot; from a prosperous long-term outlook.Company officials said world air-travel markets would reboundsharply this year after dropping about 4% last year,including a 1.8% domestic decline.   A year ago, Boeing had predicted 1992 traffic still wouldgrow by 2.9% world-wide. Boeing officials, who blame theunraveling of their 1991 prediction on the impact of the GulfWar and lingering economic problems, said the Cold War's endand renewed stability in the Middle East brighten theair-travel picture now.   While international markets began to rebound late lastyear, U.S. traffic still is limping along. The Air TransportAssociation, which tracks the performance of most major U.S.airlines, lists the January increase in U.S. traffic as only1.4%. The credit crunch and low consumer confidence are amongfactors still hobbling air travel, reducing airlines' abilityto order planes from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. andEurope's Airbus Industrie consortium.   But Jack Howard, director of market research for Boeing'sCommercial Airplane Group, suggested that the Americaneconomy has bottomed out. Domestic traffic will climb 6.3%this year and 7.8% next, Boeing said, while world-widetraffic will rise 7.6% this year and 8.7% next.</TEXT></DOC>
