The work consists ofthe development of a stabilized laser system and an atomic beam systemcoupled to the laser system. Preliminary experiments on isotope shiftmeasurements on radioactive Indium and Samarium isotopes were carriedout although the measurements were not feasible. A natural sample ofGd isotopes was heated in a tantalum oven by e-gun bombardment to producea collimated atomic beam of Gadolinium. The atomic beam interacted withthe laser beam in the perpendicular direction and resonance fluorescencewas detected by a cooled photomultiplier tube in the direction perpendicularto the atomic and the laser beam. The laser frequency was scanned indiscrete steps and the isotope shift was measured for seven stable Gadoliniumisotopes. Measurements were made for five different optical transitions,and the data were combined with the available muonic and electronic x-rayisotope shift data to extract the specific mass shift and the field shiftconstant. The change in mean square charge radius of the chain of isotopeswas extracted and the results were compared with Droplet Model prediction.</TEXT></DOC>
