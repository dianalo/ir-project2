Both banks -- Bank of North Mississippi, Oakland, Miss., and Peoples Bank, Collinsville, Ala. -- are slated to reopen as branches of other institutions.    Bank of North Mississippi's three offices, closed yesterday by state authorities, are to reopen today as branches of Bank of Mississippi, Tupelo, Miss. The failed bank had assets of $14.6 million and held $13.7 million in 4,800 deposit accounts. Bank of North Mississippi was the first bank in the state to close this year.    Peoples, closed yesterday by state regulators, is scheduled to reopen tomorrow as a branch of Bank of Geraldine, Geraldine, Ala. The reopening is being delayed because Bank of Geraldine normally is closed on Thursdays.    Peoples had assets of $12.9 million and held deposits of $12 million in 3,300 accounts. It was the second Alabama bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
