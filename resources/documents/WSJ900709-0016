The expected walkout would shut down Cominco's biglead-zinc smelter complex at Trail, British Columbia, whichat full capacity produces about 5.8% of the western world'srefined zinc, and about 2.6% of its refined lead.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The potential is for quite dramatic increases&quot; of perhapsseveral cents a pound for both lead and zinc, if there is alengthy walkout at the Trail complex, said Victor Lazarovici,analyst with Toronto's BBN James Capel Inc. In London MetalExchange spot dealings Friday, lead closed at about 41 cents(U.S.) per pound; zinc closed at 79 cents.   &quot;Physical supplies of the metals are still very tight,&quot;Mr. Lazarovici said, partly reflecting a continuing strike atBrunswick Mining andamp; Smelting Corp.'s big lead-zinc mine atBathurst, New Brunswick, where about 1,100 unionized workershave been off the job since July 1. Brunswick Mining is aunit of Noranda Inc.   At Cominco, contract talks broke off Saturday betweencompany bargainers and negotiators for the UnitedSteelworkers of America, which represents 2,900 workers atTrail and 700 more at Cominco's currently dormant lead-zincmine at Kimberley, British Columbia. The previous pactexpired June 30.   Union bargainers angrily dismissed Cominco's latest offer,which called for annual wage increases of 7.3% and 3.6%,respectively, over the life of a new two-year pact, asinadequate. The proposed pay gains reflect an average hourlywage of 16.82 Canadian dollars (US$14.47), under the previousaccord.   Union officials, citing higher wage rates for BritishColumbia's forestry workers, and for unionized workers atCominco's 50%-owned Highland Valley copper mine, said theywant to close the gap with an immediate pay boost of at least14%. Union bargainers said they also want cost-of-livingallowance (COLA) payments to continue. Cominco, which madesuch payments under the old pact, hasn't offered to restorethem.   Cominco's spokeswoman said the union's contract demandswould add about C$120 million, or an average C$9.50 an hour,to existing operating costs at Trail. &quot;It's a level thatwould shut us down. We just couldn't operate economically atthose levels,&quot; she said.   Cominco's spokeswoman said the company began a three-dayshutdown of the Trail refinery complex Friday. &quot;We have noidea when talks will resume,&quot; she said.   Union officials said the stage appears set for what couldbe a bitter and protracted strike. If so, it wouldn't be thefirst labor confrontation for Cominco, which has had a stormyrelationship with its unionized workers in recent years.   Indeed, Cominco endured a four-month strike at Trailduring the last round of contract talks, in 1987, and itscontract with workers at Highland Valley was reached lastfall, after workers struck for three and a half months.</TEXT></DOC>
