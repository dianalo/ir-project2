Rising prices turn reserves which are unusable today intoviable commodities especially when the energy needed for their productionand utilization comes from outside as in the case of nuclear fusion whichcould in the long run give a major boost to a generous hydrogen technology.The present geological reserves of coal, oil and natural gas are estimatedto come up to 13400 thousand million of coal equivalent 82% of whichis coal, 14% oil (including oil from shales and sands) and 4% are accountedfor by natural gas. Only 8% are usable under today's economic and technicalconditions. Though even these vast geological ressources are not inexhaustiblethey will last for a few centuries yet or at least long enough to giveman a chance to think of some new systems until then.</TEXT></DOC>
