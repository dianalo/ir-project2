Perry@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 08/14/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Now it can be told: George Bush switched political parties two months ago.    It happened in Clay County, near Jacksonville, Fla., where Mr. Bush is the owner of an insurance agency and an elected member of the county school board. This Mr. Bush, no relation to the president, switched from the Democrats to the Republicans. He wonders why he took so long.    &quot;I'm a conservative,&quot; he says. &quot;I just got tired of those Dukakises, the Tip O'Neills, the whole Kennedy clan, all those liberals. They cater to minorities rather than mainline citizens.&quot;    Mr. Bush is one of 128 elected Democratic officials who have switched to the Republicans this year in the Deep South, 35 of them in Florida alone. (The GOP also picked up Maurice Turner Jr., the District of Columbia's recently retired police chief.)    &quot;The worm has turned,&quot; says Clay County's Mr. Bush.    &quot;We are opening the final doors that will make us the dominant party in the South,&quot; says GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater.    &quot;It doesn't send chills down our spine,&quot; counters Michael McCurry, chief spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. &quot;They {the Republicans} have labored mightily in the vineyards -- and produced vinegar.&quot; But he concedes, quietly, that the Democrats are suffering some of the consequences &quot;of losing five of the last six presidential elections.&quot;    Out in the vineyards, Democrats aren't always sanguine. &quot;There are people switching here,&quot; says former Rep. Buddy MacKay, state campaign chairman for Florida Democrats. &quot;The Republicans have some momentum going for them. It's a head-counting game that's spooking a lot of Democrats.&quot;    &quot;We're working hard to calm down our people,&quot; says Brian Martin, political director for Mississippi Democrats. &quot;We're telling our candidates, 'Remember, you're not Michael Dukakis and you're not running against George Bush.' Don't let them stampede you.&quot;    The point of Mr. Atwater's operation is to stampede moderate and conservative Democrats, spook them and ultimately, through mass switching, to bring the Deep South, top to bottom, into the Grand Old Party.    So far, it isn't working as well as Mr. Atwater boasts, but it isn't as harmless as Mr. McCurry suggests.    Florida is the key test -- &quot;target No. 1,&quot; in Chairman Atwater's words. The state already has a Republican governor, lieutenant governor, treasurer and secretary of state, a Republican U.S. senator and Republicans in 10 of the state's 19 House seats, after a party switch by Rep. Bill Grant this year. The GOP also is favored to pick up its 11th House seat in a special election Aug. 29 to fill the late Claude Pepper's seat.    &quot;We're on a roll,&quot; says Gary Landry, chief spokesman for Florida Republicans. &quot;Next thing, we're going to take control of the state Senate in 1990.&quot;    That would be the big breakthrough -- the first state legislative chamber to turn Republican in the Deep South in modern times.    &quot;It's not ordained,&quot; says Democrat MacKay, who lost a bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate last year by 33,000 votes, while in the presidential race Mr. Bush was whomping Mr. Dukakis by 960,000 votes.    Working for the Democrats is the performance of Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, whose positive rating in statewide polls hovers at less than 50% and who seeks re-election next year. &quot;He's done everything but shoot himself in the head,&quot; says Simon Ferro, state Democratic chairman. &quot;He's going to taint a lot of other Republicans. Anybody could beat him. I could beat him.&quot;    Mr. Atwater doesn't deny Mr. Martinez may have a difficult time winning re-election, but he says he takes comfort in the fact the Democrats are hoping for a &quot;knockout punch&quot; to turn things around. &quot;That's a big change,&quot; he says. &quot;It used to be the Republicans who desperately sought the big knockout punches.&quot;    The Atwater operation works at two levels. The first involves big names -- switchers such as Rep. Grant in February and Rep. Tommy Robinson of Arkansas last month. Making the top list, too, are Secretary of State Fox McKeithen in Louisiana and State Auditor Pete Johnson in Mississippi.    But this sort of thing's been going on for years. Before Watergate closed in on Richard Nixon, Democrats were switching over to the GOP at a sprightly rate, including such big names as Govs. John Connally of Texas and Mills Godwin of Virginia. There was still another switching surge in President Reagan's first term, when the party picked up Reps. Phil Gramm of Texas, Andy Ireland of Florida and Eugene Atkinson of Pennsylvania. Mr. Atkinson, who went straight from supporting Ted Kennedy to endorsing Ronald Reagan, didn't survive politically.    Democrats say they don't worry so much about these people. As often as not, they argue, there's a special reason for their switching. Congressman Robinson, for example, makes no secret of his intention to run for governor next year. Louisiana Democratic Chairman James Brady says Mr. McKeithen switched after Republicans promised they would take care of his $400,000 campaign debt from 1987. Mr. McKeithen denies it. He is expected to be the GOP challenger to Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston next year.    &quot;The Republicans make two different pitches to these people,&quot; says Chairman Brady. &quot;First, they make sure your campaign debt gets erased. Second, they promise they'll run you for a higher office held by a Democrat.&quot;    Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Mr. Brady points to former Democratic state Rep. Jock Scott (who was also a national committeeman). He defected to the Republicans and challenged an incumbent Democratic state senator in 1987 -- and lost.    The Atwater campaign's second level is more fundamental -- and, for the long run, more significant. It's the one aimed at people like Clay County's George Bush; it's the campaign for school board members, judges, aldermen, sheriffs.    William &quot;Buddy&quot; Eubank, sheriff of Pontotoc County, Miss., is fairly typical. &quot;I began thinking about making a change while I was watching the Democratic convention on TV last summer,&quot; he says. &quot;I just thought to myself, I can't go along with the philosophy of these people. They're liberals. I'm a conservative.&quot; The sheriff switched.    &quot;Every four years,&quot; says Florida's Mr. MacKay, the Democratic Party &quot;gets hijacked by what you might call the presidential wing of the party, and that tends to pull the entire debate to the left.&quot; The result, of course, is a continuing erosion of conservative and moderate Democrats, of whom there are far more in the Deep South than in Massachusetts.    Mr. Atwater says the Democrats can't do anything about it because their party has drifted out of the mainstream and no longer offers a coherent message to the voters. &quot;They have no systematic set of beliefs,&quot; he charges.    Mr. MacKay acknowledges the existence of a problem. &quot;The first thing we've got to do,&quot; he says, &quot;is convince ourselves we haven't fallen apart. And then we've got to coordinate our message and show we are centrist, mainstream Democrats.&quot;    Mr. MacKay and other Southern party leaders lean heavily on the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of moderate Democrats seeking new directions for the party. Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia is the chairman. Leading members, with Mr. MacKay's blessing, will swing through Florida as well as Texas and Louisiana in a political cavalcade early in October &quot;to give people hope and a home,&quot; says Deb Smulyan, the council's deputy director.    &quot;This will give Democrats in Florida who feel isolated a chance to take a second look at us and at some of the people in our emerging mainstream leadership,&quot; says Mr. MacKay. &quot;We can still get our act together.&quot;    ---@ Officials Switching Parties    Elected Democratic officials in Southern states who have switched to the Republican Party this year: @ State Number of Switches @ Alabama 13 @ Florida 35 @ Georgia 6 @ Louisiana 10 @ Mississippi 39 @ North Carolina 1 @ South Carolina 7 @ Texas 17 @ TOTAL 128    Source: Republican National Committee </TEXT></DOC>
