Every time another indicator pops up to signal that theeconomy verges on recovery, some bond traders panic at thethought of resurging inflation and push up long-term interestrates. And climbing interest rates, as was demonstrated againlast week, aren't good for stocks.</LP><TEXT>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank in four consecutivesessions, ending Friday at 2976.74, down 18.12 from Thursdayand 50.76 for the week.   Bond bears, recalling the horrors of 13% annual inflationin the days of the oil embargoes, assume that as the economyrebounds later this year, prices of goods and services willresume rising at the heated pace of yester-year and rob themof future returns on their investments.   That's why they have hoisted the yield on the Treasury'sbenchmark 30-year bond to a lofty 8.47%, much higher thanwould be warranted by either the 4.9% annual rate ofinflation during the past 12 months or the 5.2% annual rateso far this year.   Many stock analysts and investors, meanwhile, think the1990s will be a period of relatively low inflation. &quot;A lot ofpeople are saying the current low level of inflation is justa temporary blip,&quot; says James Hocking, chief investmentofficer at Citicorp's private bank. &quot;But our view is thatinflation could run at 3.5% to 4% in the next several years,and it could be a lot lower than that.&quot;   Economists of the optimistic persuasion are even moresanguine. &quot;Inflation rates are going to trend down to a 2% to3% on a consumer-price-index basis by 1992 or 1993,&quot; saysEdward Yardeni, chief economist at C.J. Lawrence. He thinksthe same rebound that so frightens bond investors willproduce lower inflation because productivity tends to rocketup in the early stages of recovery.   Beyond that, though, Mr. Yardeni and other economiststhink U.S. productivity will continue improving ascompetition intensifies in many industries, holding downprices and forcing companies to preserve their currentlyfashionable lean-and-mean look. &quot;Partly because productivitywas so pathetic in the 1970s and 1980s, it's got to getbetter,&quot; he says.   Commodity prices, too, should remain relatively low incoming years, especially now that the Allied success in theGulf War practically assures ample supplies of oil.&quot;World-wide, there are ample supplies of just abouteverything,&quot; says Gary Shilling, a Springfield, N.J.,economist who predicts inflation soon will fall to a 1% to 2%annual rate.   With stock prices already at record levels and bondsproviding hefty yields, it would seem that all thoseforecasts of lower inflation would argue for shiftinginvestments to bonds. Some analysts recommend doing justthat, but others say the stock market will thrive in alow-inflation environment.   James Renshaw, chairman of Van Strum andamp; Towne Inc., aninvestment advisory firm in San Francisco, has compiledstatistics for the past 31 years comparing the ratio of shareprices to per-share earnings of the 30 stocks in the DowJones Industrial Average to the annual inflation rate asmeasured by the government's consumer price index. His datashow that P-E ratios shrink markedly as inflation rises.   On average, he says, investors are willing to pay onlyabout seven times earnings if annual inflation is 12%. But atan annual inflation rate of just 1%, investors are willing topay a hefty 20 times earnings for stocks. Over the past 70years, Mr. Renshaw says, the correlation between the DowJones industrials and inflation works out to an average P-Eof 13 to 14.   Declining inflation coupled with rising earnings fromproductivity gains could be a powerful combination for thestock market, says Mr. Renshaw. He figures that modestearnings gains and a reduction in the annual inflation rateto 3% from the 1990 average rate of 5.2% could easily liftthe Dow Jones Industrial Average to 4000 in 1992. And adecrease in the inflation rate to just 1.5% could drive theDow Jones industrials up 50% from current levels.   &quot;Obviously the incentives for reaching and maintaininginflation at as low rates as possible are tremendous,&quot; hesays.   Money managers agree that they would pay more for stocksif inflation remains lower. &quot;If we had a modest recovery withlow inflation and lower interest rates, a P-E of 20 is not atall a problem,&quot; says James Crawford, managing director of J.andamp; W. Seligman, a New York money management firm.   But not all stocks will benefit equally from lowinflation. What's an investor to do?   Mr. Crawford says he's sticking to the growth stocks thathave already performed so well. Some investors worry thatgrowth stocks are too pricey, but Mr. Crawford argues that ifinflation remains low, those prices are easily justified andwill continue to rise.   Mr. Yardeni, the C.J. Lawrence economist, foresees abroad-based rally that will carry many stocks higher. But hesays one attractive strategy might be to pick the bestcompanies in the worst industries on the theory that ashakeout in many industries will favor the best-managedcompanies.   &quot;Industries like banking, retailing and airlinesoverexpanded to meet all the demands of the baby boomers,&quot; hesays. &quot;Now that the baby boomers are becoming couch potatoes,you don't have as much demand for mortgages and retailstores. The companies that are going to survive are going todo extraordinarily well.&quot;   But Mr. Shilling warns that while lower inflation will begood for stocks in the long run, there are pitfalls along theway. &quot;I think we'll see inflation in the 1% to 2% area,&quot; hesays, &quot;but you have to remember that the way we get there isthrough recession.&quot; He warns that even if the economyrebounds from the current recession, the recovery probablywill be weak and mightn't last long before the economy onceagain slips into a decline.   &quot;If further recession is ahead, you have to worry aboutthe earnings to which you apply higher P-Es,&quot; he says, notingthat a disappointing earnings projection by Compaq recentlysent the stock crashing. &quot;They didn't even bother to take thecompany out in the back to shoot it; they just shot it whereit stood,&quot; he says.   Mr. Shilling says the safest approach to stocks if aninvestor expects further recession is to stick with bigelectric utilities, which he says are &quot;stocks that act likebonds.&quot; Some growth companies may fare well in a sluggishrecovery and subsequent decline, he says, &quot;but even thosehave some risk because there's been such a surge to buy themand they may not survive another economic dip untouched.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Rising bond yields sent stock prices tumbling.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 18.12 points lowerto 2976.74, recovering a bit from losses of more than 30points earlier in the day. By the close, declining issuesoutnumbered advancers, 1,121 to 465, on the New York StockExchange where volume was 167,826,000 shares.   Broader averages also tumbled: Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex slipped 4.20 to 379.43 and the New York Stock Exchangecomposite fell 2.05 to 208.19.   For the week, the industrial average fell 50.76 points, or1.68%; the Sandamp;P 500 eased 2.67%, and the Big Board's compositeindex lost 2.25%.   Friday's employment data for May stunned both stock andbond investors. Payrolls rose by 59,000, the first increasesince June 1990. Analysts said the employment reportindicated that the economy may be recovering more quicklythan expected.   Consequently, U.S. bond prices fell $5 for each $1,000face amount, taking yields up to 8.47%, around the highestlevels of the year.   Stock investors concluded that further reductions inshort-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve are probablyfar off in the future. They sold several financial shares,and especially savings and loans, whose profits can beaffected by short-term interest rates.   Golden West Financial tumbled 1 7/8 to 36; Great WesternFinancial fell 5/8 to 17 3/4 and H.F. Ahmanson eased 1/2 to19 1/8.   &quot;A slight rise in interest rates shouldn't hurt earningsof these companies,&quot; said Nancy Spady, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers. &quot;But I think investors are taking profits.&quot;   Brokerage stocks also lost ground. Salomon Brothers fell 17/8 to 32 3/8; Quick andamp; Reilly Group slipped 5/8 to 17 3/4 andPaineWebber Group fell 3/8 to 22 5/8.   Goldman Sachs crossed 2,547,700 shares of BankAmerica,equal to 1.2% of all shares outstanding, at 39. That made thestock the second most active issue on the Big Board at 3.2million shares. BankAmerica closed down 3/8 to 39.   However, many New York banks closed higher. This newspaperreported Friday that many analysts think mergers will occurbetween the big banks in the near future. Chemical Bankgained 1 to 24 1/4 and Manufacturers Hanover rose 1/4 to 265/8.   Greg A. Smith, chief strategist at Prudential Securities,reduced his stock positions in his asset-allocation models.&quot;I believe that the odds of a correction in the stock marketof two or three-month duration, and perhaps 10% in magnitude,are increasingly likely,&quot; Mr. Smith said in a memo to hisinstitutional sales force.   For large pension fund accounts, Mr. Smith raised cashreserves to 10% from 0%; cut the bond allocation to 35% from40%; and reduced stocks to 55% from 60%.   In large equity funds, Mr. Smith raised cash to 15% from5%; and cut the stock allocation to 85% from 95%. The bondallocation was left unchanged at 0%.   For small aggressive funds, Prudential's strategist raisedcash to 20% from 10%; left bonds unchanged at 15% and cutstocks to 65% from 75%.   Mr. Smith said his allocation change was related to hiscomments in a June 5 strategy report, which urged caution.That report said, in part: &quot;In this stage, investors mustdepend very heavily on earnings to lift stock prices, asopposed to interest rates and valuation . . . Onlysurprisingly strong earnings can boost the stock market 10%or more.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
