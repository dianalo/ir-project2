Treasury sought commentson, and alternatives to, five specific notice approaches. These approacheswere: (1) Putting up a short notice prescribed by Treasury conspicuouslyat every location in the financial institution where customers may conductcash transactions; (2) requiring that a short Treasury form notice be handedto any person conducting currency transactions over a specified amount(<T3>e.g</T3>., $1000 or $3000); (3) requiring that all deposit slips beimprinted with a short notice prescribed by Treasury of the provisionsof Section 5324 and that a person making a currency deposit over a certainamount ($1000 or $3000)) sign the back of the deposit slip in acknowledgmentof reading such notice; (4) mailing a Treasury form notice to all customersby a certain date and to all new customers upon the opening of an account;and (5) requiring that a short Treasury form notice of the provisions ofsection 5324 be included periodically, <T3>e.g., </T3>quarterly, in all customers' monthly account statements,and upon opening a new account. After review of the comments received on this proposal and further legalanalysis of the possible law enforcement need for the proposal, Treasuryhas decided not to proceed with the proposal. Treasury's position continuesto be that the law and legislative history are clear on this issue, thatis, that the government need only prove that a criminal defendant had actualknowledge of the currency reporting requirements and the specific intentto evade them; the government need not prove that the defendant had knowledgeof the structuring prohibitions. Therefore, Treasury is withdrawing thisproposal from further consideration at this time.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 28, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Salvatore R.
