Through thispolicy, EPA encourages the use of the least toxic inert ingredients availableand requires the development of data necessary to determine the conditionsof safe use of products that contain toxic inert ingredients. In developingthis policy, EPA categorized inert ingredients into the following fourlists according to toxicity:<ITAG tagnum="21">List 1 Inerts of toxicological concern</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">List 2 Potentially toxic inerts, with high priority for testing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">List 3 Inerts of unknown toxicity</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">List 4 Inerts of minimal concern</ITAG>List 1 and List 2 were published as part of the April 22, 1987 policy statement.The criteria developed by EPA to categorize List 1 inerts were reviewedby the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act's ScientificAdvisory Panel (FIFRA SAP). Chemicals were placed on the list of inertsof toxicological concern if they met any one of the following criteria.<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Carcinogenicity:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A rating as a human carcinogen of probable human carcinogen (rating1, 2A or 2B) by International Agency for Research on Cancer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Characterized by the National Toxicology Program as an animal carcinogenin at least one species and one sex.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Being regulated by some Federal agency as a carcinogen.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Neurotoxicity and other Chronic Effects:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Identified in the Occupational Diseases, a Guide to their Recognition(1977), as causing neurotoxicological and other chronic effects in theworkplace environment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Being regulated by some Federal agency as a neurotoxin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Peer reviewed study, included in the Toxicology Data Bank of theNational Library of Medicine, reporting neurotoxic or other chronic effects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Adverse Reproductive Effects:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Being regulated by some Federal agency as causing adverse reproductiveeffects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Peer reviewed study, included in the Toxicology Data Bank of theNational Library of Medicine, reporting adverse reproductive effects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(4) Ecological Effects:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_An LC50 of less than one part per million.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Revision of Lists of Inert Ingredients</ITAG>Since the publication of the policy, EPA has received additional data onsome of the listed inerts. EPA scientists have reviewed this informationaccording to criteria previously developed and used in the creation ofthe initial lists. As a result of this recent examination of new data,EPA proposed modifications to the lists. These modifications were submittedto the FIFRA SAP for review. The FIFRA SAP concluded that the proposedchanges were justified.EPA is announcing the following revised List 1 and List 2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>List 1._</T4><T4>Inerts of Toxicological

1</ITAG>Di-(2-ethylhexyl)adipate and dimethyl-formamide (DMF) were moved to List1 from Lists 3 and 2, respectively. Based on a National Toxicology Programbioassay, positive results for oncogenicity were indicated for di-(2-ethyl-hexyl)adipate:This chemical caused increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinomasin female mice, and thus meets one of the criteria for categorization asa List 1 inert. For dimethylformamide (DMF), hepatotoxicity has been reported at very lowdoses in animal studies and is commonly observed in case reports of industrialexposure. Developmental toxicity has also been reported to occur in animalstudies in the literature. In addition, recent reports of clusters of testicularcancer associated with human exposure to DMF have added to the weight ofevidence which supports upgrading this compound from List 2 to List 1.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additions to List 2</ITAG>Based on data available at the time of the April 22, 1987, FR Notice, monochlorobenzenewas determined to be an oncogen as well as an ecotoxin. For these reasons,it was placed on List 1. The EPA Science Advisory Board has reviewed theoncogenicity data on monochlorobenzene and concluded that it is a classD oncogen, i.e., not classifiable. EPA scientists have reevaluated theecotoxicity data and concluded that monochlorobenzene does not meet List1 ecotoxicity triggers. Because of these determinations, monochlorobenzeneis being moved from List 1 to List 2 and is now considered as a high priorityfor testing. Methyl ethyl ketoxime has been moved from List 3 to List 2 because of itsclose structural relationship to acetoxime, which has been reported asbeing carcinogenic in preliminary tests and is also positive in a mouselymphoma test. Methyl ethyl ketoxime has been proposed for testing undersection 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additions to Lists 3 and 4</ITAG>To accommodate revision of the lists, EPA has decided to subdivide List4 into two parts. The previous List 4, representing inerts generally regardedas safe, has become List 4A, and a new List 4B has been created. List 4Bis composed of inerts for which EPA has sufficient information to reasonablyconclude that the current use patterns in pesticide products will not adverselyaffect public health and the environment. List 4B inerts in formulationsproposed for new use patterns which cause significant increases in exposurewill receive further scrutiny.Two inerts, gammabutyrolactone and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS),are being removed from List 2 because EPA now has a complete human healtheffects data base indicating that they do not meet the criteria for List1 and that their current use in pesticides should not adversely affecthuman health. The placement of gammabutyrolactone on List 2 was based on structural analogyto the known oncogen, betabutyrolactone. Further review indicates thisanalogy is inappropriate. In addition, a review of toxicity data for gammabutyrolactone,including acute and subchronic data, developmental toxicity, mutagenicity,and oncogenicity indicates a low order of toxicity. Thus EPA has decidedto remove gammabutyrolactone from List 2 and add it to List 4B becausecurrent use patterns pose minimal risk for human health. Because gammabutyrolactonehas not been adequately tested for ecotoxicity, however, it is being placedon List 3 for these effects. EPA decided to list the inert on two liststo reflect the different degree of knowledge the Agency has about the inert'svarious effects. EPA considered it appropriate to place the inert on List4B because it has sufficient information about human health effects, andto also place it on List 3 to reflect inadequate information concerningthe ecotoxicity of this inert. DSS was placed on List 2 because of developmental and reproductive toxicityconcerns as well as ecotoxicity concern for surfactants. Data have nowbeen reviewed for these effects, and indicate a low order of toxicity.Thus, DSS is added to List 4B for nonadverse effects on human health. Becauseof limited ecotoxicity testing, however, DSS remains on List 3 (unknowntoxicity) for these effects. <ITAG tagnum="84">Deletions From All Lists </ITAG>Further investigation of ethylene thiourea, carbon disculfide, and 1, 1-dimethylhydrazine(UDMH, the impurity in Alar, which is in Special Review), has revealedthat these are only impurities, not intentionally added inerts. Furthermore,betabutyrolactone, benzene, dichlorvos, 1, 2-dimethyl-hydrazine, pentachlorophenoland sodium pentachlorophenate, dinitro-o-cresol, dinitrophenol, ethyl methylphenylglycidate,formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde, hexachlorophene, mercuryoleate, 2-nitropropane, 1, 2-dichloropropane, and thiourea are not nowused as inerts in any pesticide products. Therefore, these chemicals havebeen removed from all lists of inert ingredients and are not currentlycleared for use as inerts in any pesticide product. Thus, in the eventa registrant or applicant proposes to include one of these chemicals asan inert ingredient in a pesticide product, EPA will consider the chemicala new inert. Impurities in registered products are contaminants from the manufacturingprocess for the active ingredient, rather than intentionally added inertingredients. The presence and toxicity of impurities is routinely evaluatedduring the normal Agency review processes. Impurities are identified inthe product chemistry review, and would probably have been present, aspart of the test material, during testing considered for support of theregistration. Thus, it is not appropriate to subject impurities to theInerts Strategy. As discussed in the April 22, 1987 Notice, registrants with products containingList 1 inert ingredients must amend their product registrations by addingthe following statement to the label:<ITAG tagnum="20">This product contains the toxic inert ingredient (name of inert).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The wording should be placed in close proximity to the ingredientsstatement in a type size comparable to other front panel text. Since dimethylformamideand di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate have been added to List 1, registrants ofproducts containing these inerts are required to submit applications toamend their product labels not later than May 22, 1990. Products containingone or more of these inert ingredients released for shipment after May22, 1991 must have the amended label in place. Registrants of products containing dimethylformamide have already receiveda Data Call-In. All registrants have either voluntarily cancelled or committedto reformulate the product. Most reformulations have been received; a fewtime extensions were granted to allow for necessary testing of the reformulatedproduct. A Data Call-In for di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate will be issued, at the sametime as for diethylhexylpthalate, since the uses are similar and we expectto find them in the same types of products. Data Call-Ins for other originalList 1 inerts were mailed in March 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Stocks of Old Formulations </ITAG>Registrants are encouraged to substitute or remove any List 1 or List 2inert ingredient from their products by submiting a new Confidential Statementof Formula as a proposed amendment to the registration. The April 22, 1987Policy statement did not address provisions governing the sale of stockof old formulations. If a registrant reformulates its product to replacea List 1 or List 2 inert ingredient with a less toxic inert, EPA has determinedthat some limit on continued sale of stocks of the old formulation is appropriate.Once a registrant submits the revised formulation, registrants may manufactureonly the old formulation, properly labeled as containing a toxic inertas described above, until EPA accepts the new formulation. Stocks of theold formulation, bearing the required labeling, may be released for shipmentby the registrant for a period not to exceed twelve months from the dataEPA accepts the new formulation. Products already in channels of trade(retailers, distributors, dealers) are not subject to this limitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 10, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
