The officials said students set fire to a barricade doused withpaint thinner when the raiding force burst in, setting severalpolice ablaze.   Police, who refused to give their names, said about 700 trooperslaunched a dawn raid on Dongui University to rescue five officerstaken hostage Tuesday after a demonstration by students.   About 20 other troopers and radical students were injured in thefighting, 10 of them seriously.   Students holding the hostages on the seventh floor of the schoollibrary set the thinner-drenched barricade aflame when troopersburst in and several attacking officers were set on fire, theofficials said on condition of anonymity.   Some troopers, wrapped in flames, leapt out of windows. Otherschoked to death on the smoke or were badly burned, they reported.Three troopers were dead on arrival at a hospital and three diedwhile undergoing emergency treatment, they said.   All of the hostages were later freed when professors intervenedand persuaded the students to let them go, officials said.   Korean Broadcasting System, the state television network, said88 students were arrested in the fighting in South Korea's secondlargest city.   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said it was the worst lossof police life in recent years. Officers could not recall anycomparable incident.   The students had seized five officers as hostages to protest anincident Monday when a police officer fired warning shots asprotesters attacked a police station. Radical students claimedpolice overreacted by firing. They also demanded release of afellow student being held by police, officials said.   Police officials negotiated unsuccessfully through the night forthe hostages' release and authorities then ordered a raid to freethem.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recentweeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow ofPresident Roh Tae-woo's government.   Pusan and other South Korean cities experienced violence Mondayin protests marking the international May Day labor holiday. Theprotests came the day after riot police blocked a major labor rallyin Seoul.   Protests rarely result in deaths in South Korea, however, inspite of the fury of street clashes in which protesters battle riotpolice with firebombs and rocks. Riot police are normally onlyarmed with tear gas and batons.</TEXT></DOC>
