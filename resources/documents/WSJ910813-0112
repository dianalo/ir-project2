That's understandable -- theentertainment industry, though ever volatile, is a pocket ofplenty amid a wilting economy in Lotusland.   Actually, it's doubtful the Van Nuys parcel will become afilm lot or anything else soon. The environmental testing andcleanup now required of industrial sites prior to sale cancause substantial delays (which don't help Americancompetitiveness, by the way, and encourage inefficient sprawlto untainted sites). But, after the California comedown of1991, job creation isn't taken for granted. Most of the statehasn't struggled like this in 20 years.</LP><TEXT>   The local pessimists are ahead on points over those whothought that continued population growth, entrepreneurialdrive and immigrant investment could spare SouthernCalifornia from catching the economic flu. Officialemployment stats for Los Angeles County show a 2% drop fromJuly 1990 to July 1991.   The declining aerospace industry has been at the root ofanalysts' Angst. It isn't going down without a dogfight: LA'sliberal Democrats in Congress are drawing flak for notbringing home the ballistics. But that battle is mostly over.Demilitarization is winning.   Aerospace also is a target of regional air-qualityregulations. Those rules are crimping LA's giant petroleumrefineries as well. They face a downturn in driving, too, sothey're consolidating; Shell is leaving altogether. So aresmall manufacturers in other industries.   What strength can Southern California draw on, then? Spellit s-t-y-l-e. Outside of health care and biotechnology, whichare a growing source of good jobs everywhere, thevalue-adding action in the region is in the image andappearances trades. This exportable output can be summarizedin three parts: &quot;Hollywood,&quot; fashion and other design.   The motion-picture business shows no sign of leaving,though the glamorous aspects of it (save Paramount) moved outof Hollywood proper long ago. Beverly Hills has kept some ofthe glitz, but the greatest celluloid concentration inAmerica now occurs in the vicinity of Burbank -- the SanFernando Valley city that was once the butt of jokes ontelevision's &quot;Laugh-In&quot; show.   Burbank is such a thriving production center thatno-growth initiatives aimed at studio-related offices wereplaced on the municipal ballot this past winter. They weredefeated but at great cost, a reminder that trafficcongestion remains an obstacle to providing even &quot;clean&quot; workin a region with 8.6% unemployment.   Such obstruction led the Economic Development Corp. of LACounty to issue a brief last month on show biz's contributionto the economy. It found the business to be made up mainly ofsmall outfits such as the post-production studios that dotHollywood and the Valley. To the south, in Orange County,corporate videos for training and promotion engage anestimated 150 small firms. All told, area employment inscreen fare probably exceeds 110,000.   The celebrity culture and make-believe atmosphere of themovie theme parks feed tourism, an even-larger but not sowell-paying Southern California industry. And Los Angeles isthe nation's leading hub for recording artistry, anothersource of world-class output (believe it or not) whose workis often integral to films.   But a less noticeable synergy with Hollywood (and MTV) isto be found in fashion. Designers have traded on the &quot;LAlook&quot; in some popular television shows.   The longer-running California clothing craze has been theyouthful, casual attire that is now standard garb for much ofthe world once suits and dresses are off for the night or theweekend. The Gap, a favorite son, is also the most successfulchain clothier in America. Although some of the hotbeach/active-wear makers cooled off noticeably during thepast year, their product has reached a mainstream -- andincreasingly international -- clientele.   The state's designers broke through in the 1960s with thefirst junior-sportswear line for women. During the 1980s,California broadened its manufacturing base. Its 130,000garment workers, mostly nonunion, surpassed the number in NewYork. (Most are in the Los Angeles area, but in San Franciscoapparel is still the largest manufacturing presence.)   Only in the current recession has this sector's growthstopped, but many in the industry expect local production toresume its gain. Makers are finding they're better off sewingstylish items close to the U.S. market, rather than farmingoutput offshore, where it is subject to delays.   The rag trade is a point of entry to the labor market forthousands of Southern California immigrants. But theopportunities don't end with low-wage assembly. Severalrespected specialty schools offer alternatives to atraditional academic grind, and the chances for upwardmobility are enhanced further by the relative absence of anold-boys' network in the industry locally. All this wellsuits California's changing cultural mix.   At LA's Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, thestudent body is now more than 20% of Asian heritage, andnearly 10% foreign. (Blacks have dipped from 15% in the 1970sto 5% now, school officials say.) Total enrollment nearlydoubled in the 1980s, and a new main campus was builtdowntown. The curriculum includes cosmetics, embracinganother growing industry in the state.   Interior-design work is cut from the same cloth --literally, in some cases. Fabric innovations combine withadvances in other materials and lighting technologyas well asever-changing consumer tastes -- to keep the showroom lightson, even in a down real-estate market. As in some other U.S.cities, design shops in Los Angeles and San Francisco havehelped to revive deteriorating neighborhoods.   Product design, meanwhile, reaches its highest (-priced)art form in the auto industry, whose world leaders now lookto California to determine the shape and feel of tomorrow'smodels. Several big auto makers now have their own creativecenters in the LA area or, as BMW announced last week itwould, exploit the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.   These endeavors are the stuff of trends, and California isnothing if not chic. But in applying creativity to seriousproduction, the state may be establishing a criticalindustrial mass of the sort it needs in order to overcome itsother reputation, as a highcost, high-crime locale. Much asNew York City for decades got away with being inhospitableand stayed &quot;the place to be&quot; for those with talents of manytypes, so too may Los Angeles endure.   Exercising judgments over which fresh face to put on thesilver screen or whether to strip lace on the legs of Lycrashorts is not such a serious contribution to the welfare ofmankind. But there's no sense underestimating the popularappetite for novelty along with quality. GM neglected both,and fades. California, as always, offers hope of makingsomething good out of starting anew.</TEXT></DOC>
