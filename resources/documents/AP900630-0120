(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kazimieras Augustinas Saturday pouredwhat he hoped was his last canister of black-market gasoline,smuggled past Moscow's blockade of Lithuania by someone fromneighboring Soviet Byelorussia.   Augustinas paid four times the state price for the nine gallons,then wound his way from the site outside Vilnius where thousands ofLithuanians, Poles, Russians, Vietnamese and Chinese trade goodsfrom bicycles to chandeliers.   With a bit of capitalist free enterprise and socialist vacationpay, Lithuanians survived the Kremlin's ten-week blockade.   Summer weather and power from a nuclear plant also helpedresidents weather the crisis.   The Kremlin cut off shipments of oil, most natural gas and otherproducts such as coffee and sugar to force Lithuania to rescind itsMarch 11 declaration of independence.   Lithuania's Parliament agreed Friday to a 100-day moratorium onthe declaration. The moratorium goes into effect when the Sovietsbegin negotiations on the republic's independence.   The first oil began flowing toward Lithuania's Mazhiekiairefinery Saturday.   Last week, as Lithuanian leaders flew to Moscow to hammer out adeal with the Soviet leadership, Vilnius was crowded with trafficfueled by black-market gasoline. Only the dark streets hinted thatsomething was amiss.   But as residents adjusted, Lithuanian officials warned theharvest was endangered for lack of fuel, and the summer andvacation pay that financed the black-market would soon beexhausted. The 50,000 people left jobless by the blockade were soonexpected to be joined by hundreds of thousands.   Although the blockade left Lithuania with an estimated 344million-ruble deficit in consumer goods _ almost $573 million atthe official exchange rate _it also pushed the republic toward amarket economy.   When gasoline disappeared, people bought gas in neighboringrepublics at 7 cents a quart and sold it for 50 cents. Soon,Lithuanians could buy all the gas they wanted and the price droppedto 33 cents per quart.   The center of the gasoline trade is a bustling, dusty fieldoutside Vilnius that has been transformed into a market where onecan buy Egyptian jeans, `Jelp' laundry soap, auto sun-roof, ginsengteabags and even American currency.   Prices at the market are staggering in a nation where theaverage person earns 240 rubles a month _ $400 at the officialexchange rate or $13 at the black-market exchange rate. LeatherAdidas high-tops sold for 700 rubles; a sausage cost 20 rubles.   Vitas Markauskas said he spent 500 rubles on electric drills andbarbecues, toys and radiators in Lithuania and sold them for 2,000rubles in Poland. He then bought 2,000 rubles worth of Polish goodsand was selling them in Vilnius for 4,000 rubles.   Markauskas figured he earned 3,500 rubles for a week's work andquit his job in the state factory where he earned 250 rubles amonth.   ``If I'm at work, I have no time to make money,'' he explained.   At the Plasta factory in Vilnius, massive presses stood idlewhile a lone worker stacked plastic packaging material. The Kremlincut off the factory's supply of polyethylene, even though 92percent of its output of sewer pipe and industrial parts goes tothe other Soviet republics and not Lithuania.   Two-thirds of the 2,300 workers at the factory were sent onvacation, said assistant commercial director Edmundas Armoska.   Like most Soviet factories accustomed to irregular supplies,Plasta had a large inventory of raw materials on hand when theblockade began.   Plasta expanded its small plastic recycling operation andtransforming used bottles into shopping bags to keep the factoryrunning during the blockade.   ``Now, we are using everything we can get,'' said purchasingdirector Victoras Jankevicius.</TEXT></DOC>
