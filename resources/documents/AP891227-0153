CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   In religion, the decade of the 1980s started with a plunge intopolitics by America's ``religious right'' and is ending with aburst of new freedoms for believers within the Soviet orbit.   Over the past 10 years, the religion domain also has been joltedwith scandals, hit with jail terms for ``sanctuary'' workers andshaken with conflicts over homosexuality, the Bible and abortion.   Simultaneously the quest for Christian unity, though flaggingfrom its earlier euphoria, nevertheless made substantial strides.So did closer Jewish-Christian relations, despite rocky moments.   But the main religious hallmarks of the 80s were the burst intoU.S. political activism by church conservatives and the burgeoningof religious rights in lands long shackled under atheist statism.   The freshening spiritual breath in Eastern Europe emanated inpart from the churches themselves and from that surprising SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev.   Capping the trend was the unprecedented friendly meeting thisyear between Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II. The Vatican wasscorned by previous Soviet leadership as impotent for lack ofmilitary power.   But while religious opportunities grew in most Communist areas,even in China despite the brutal anti-democracy suppression lastsummer, the churches met persistent harassment in Latin American.   But they also became bastions of human rights there, although along line of Christian workers were slain, particularly El Salvadorand Guatamala, along with thousands of civilians.   The decade there began with the assassination of El Salvador'sRoman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 and ended in 1989with the murder of six Jesuit priests.   U.S. churches entered a sanctuary movement to shelter refugeesfleeing the strife-ridden area. But the formerly open movementedged underground after several participants were convicted in 1986of smuggling aliens.   A key religious development of the decade was the emergence intopublic affairs of the long insular religious right, which hadpreviously denounced such activity as meddling in politics.   But they surged from their spiritual closet in l980, along withtheir paragon, former President Ronald Reagan, claiming credit forelecting him that year and again in 1984.   The changed mode was sparked by a suave Virginia preacher, JerryFalwell, who founded Moral Majority in l979, and led it through 10years of robust politicking, closing it down only this year.   ``Mission accomplished,'' he said, adding that otherconservative Christian lobbying groups had evolved to handle thecause.   The movement's prime objectives _ public school prayer, tuitiontax credits for church schools and stopping abortion _ remainedunaccomplished. But ferment continued about them.   A conservative tide also swept the Southern Baptist Convention,where fundamentalists gained the presidency in 1979 and held itthrough l989, broadening control throughout that biggest Protestantbody.   It was a battle for the Bible, fundamentalists contended,gradually imposing their demand for literalist ``biblicalinerrancy'' _ historically and scientifically _ on denominationalagencies.   Meanwhile, mainline denominations suffered declines inmembership, and their chief cooperative organization, the NationalCouncil of Churches, fell into operational and financial disarraylate in the decade.   But remodeling work was underway, with efforts to bring moreevangelical churches and Roman Catholicism into full membership.   Also, quiet but steady progress continued on the ecumenicalfront.   Northern and Southern Presbyterians, separated since the CivilWar, united in 1983 into the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) and threebranches of Lutherans united in 1987 into the Evangelical LutheranChurch in America.   Of wider significance, a stream of world-wide, largely favorableresponses flowed into the World Council of Churches to a remarkablyinclusive ``convergence agreeement.''   Dealing with key issues dividing churches _ baptism, eucharistand ministry _ the ``BEM'' document was produced by representativesof Protestantism, Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy at a l982meeting in Lima, Peru.   The deepening ties were dramatized at a giant largely Baptistrally in Columbia, S.C., where the pope preached on his 1987 U.S.trip, flanked by leading figures of most U.S. denominations.   But he had a tense session with his U.S. hierarchy in LosAngeles, where bishops told him Americans were used to beingpersuaded rather than told what to believe. But he insisteddissenters were't good Catholics.   Seeking to tighten Vatican controls, he stripped noted moraltheologian Charles Curran of teaching credentials in 1986 andtemporarily curtailed the authority of Seatle Archbishop RaymondHunthausen, restoring it in 1987.   The Vatican's mid-decade repudiation of homosexualty as a``moral disorder'' continued to stir sharp resentments anddisruptions in Catholic churches.   Sex scandals hit two prominent television evangelists, JimmySwaggart and Jim Bakker. Baker resigned his PTL network in 1987over a sexual tryst and in 1989 was convicted and imprisoned fordefrauding contributors.   Swaggart was defrocked in 1988 for sexual misbehavior after herefused to to accept disciplines imposed by his denomination, theAssemblies of God.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Dec. 29.</NOTE></DOC>
