The ES computerwith large on-line storage (not less than 1 Mbite) and fast response(not less than 300.000 of operations per a second) should enter the ACScomposition. Several program complexes are used in the NPP ACS. The programscollected into the EhNERGIYa library are used to provide central controlsystem operation. The information-retrival system called the Fuel fileis used to automate NPP fuel motion account, as well as to estimate efficiencyof fuel application, to carry out calculations of a fuel component ofelectric and heat energy production cost. The automated information systemfor unit operation efficiency analysis, which solves both plant and unit-levelproblems, including engineering and economical factors and complexingof operation parameter bank, is under trial operation.</TEXT></DOC>
