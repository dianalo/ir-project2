Wilder, Mr. Inside, Challenges   A More Charismatic Mr. Outside, Jesse Jackson   ----   By James M. Perry   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/03/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20</SO><LP>   WASHINGTON -- At about 9 o'clock Saturday night, VirginiaGov. Douglas Wilder will step to the podium at Atlanta'sWestin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and deliver a polite lecture tothe Rev. Jesse Jackson and his National Rainbow Coalition.   Mr. Wilder, the nation's first black elected governor, hasbeen criss-crossing the country, preaching a message ofDemocratic party unity and mainstream values that sometimesseems to be targeted directly at the prickly, thin-skinnedMr. Jackson, a two-time presidential candidate who may decideto run again in 1992.</LP><TEXT>   Gov. Wilder will deliver his message personally Saturdaynight in the lion's den -- to Mr. Jackson himself and toabout 1,000 of the people who worked for him, campaigned forhim and attended national conventions as his delegates andalternates.   &quot;People call it 'The War of the Roses,'&quot; says JosephJohnson, executive director of Mr. Jackson's RainbowCoalition, referring to a movie in which an angry coupledestroys almost everything they own. &quot;But that's not fair.&quot;   Fair or not, the contest between these two black leadersis more and more perceived as a battle between Mr. Inside andMr. Outside. Mr. Inside, Gov. Wilder, spent 16 years in theVirginia state senate and served four years as lieutenantgovernor before being elected governor last year. Mr.Outside, the charismatic Mr. Jackson, has never been electedto any public office and disappointed some of his friends bydeclining to run for mayor of Washington this year.   National Democrats who quake at the prospect of anotherJackson presidential campaign see Mr. Wilder as a checkmateto Mr. Jackson's ambitions and possibly even as a runningmate to the party's 1992 nominee.   Gov. Wilder has surprised some of his friends by theeagerness with which he has stepped forward to challenge bothMr. Jackson's position as his party's premier blackpolitician and his views on how the party should proceed tobecome competitive once again in presidential elections.   Mr. Wilder calls, first of all, for the kind of partyunity in which politicians who lose agree to support thepeople who win, without cavil. In both 1984 and 1988, Mr.Jackson demanded concessions and special treatment from thewinners of the party's presidential nomination, WalterMondale first, then Michael Dukakis.   &quot;If those who fail to win in our primaries don't rejecttheir sense of injury and unite behind our candidates -- comeelection day it will be Democratic nominees who arerejected,&quot; says Gov. Wilder, in a remark that could hardly bemore pointed (though he insists he isn't singling out Mr.Jackson).   Mr. Wilder's chief political adviser, Virginia partychairman Paul Goldman, sponsored a resolution at the mostrecent meeting of the Democratic National Committee'sexecutive commitee calling for an end to &quot;internecinepolitical warfare&quot; within the party and urging &quot;allDemocrats, especially those with prior experience in thepresidential primary process,&quot; to take steps to remedy theproblem. It, too, could hardly be more pointed. Theresolution was passed unanimously.   But perhaps even more importantly, Mr. Wilder ischallenging Mr. Jackson on the basic direction the DemocraticParty should take to once again become competitive inpresidential elections.   As Mr. Wilder sees it, the nation is &quot;being asked tochoose between two great forces -- the forces that are lockedin the past and the forces that look to the future.&quot; Needlessto say, he comes down on the side of the future. &quot;This forceof the future,&quot; he says, &quot;is what I call America's NewMainstream, that uniquely American combination of solidfamily values and individual initiative that knows our bestyears are ahead of us.&quot;   He boasts that he balanced his state's budget by cutting$1 billion in spending. Democrats, he says, face &quot;a choicebetween individuals who intend to lead a government whichpromotes fiscal responsibility and an ability to compete in aglobal economy {and} government that runs up huge deficitsand ignores fundamental changes in economic reality.&quot;   Throwing money at social problems isn't &quot;a panacea&quot; foreverything, Gov. Wilder says. More important is &quot;the power ofeconomic development. For we know that it's among thegreatest of all social equalizers.&quot;   Mr. Jackson -- neither he nor Mr. Wilder would beinterviewed about their relationship -- dismisses thegovernor's talk about a new mainstream. In a recent speech inNew Orleans, Mr. Jackson said: &quot;For those who are not in themainstream, does that mean backwater? Does that meancesspool? We want justice to roll down like a mighty stream,not like a narrow mainstream.&quot;   While Mr. Wilder addresses ordinary voters struggling withpaying their bills and worrying about crime and drugs, Mr.Jackson continues to concentrate on the victims of society,the jobless, the workers on picket lines, even, frequently,the fate of oppressed people in Third World nations. Hespends much of his time recalling the triumphs of hismentors, including the Rev. Martin Luther King, and recitinghis own primary successes in his two presidential campaigns.   &quot;The governor doesn't wallow in the past,&quot; asserts Mr.Goldman, his political adviser. &quot;Others&quot; -- he refuses tosingle out Mr. Jackson -- &quot;tell you what's wrong. But you'vegot to tell people what they've accomplished just to keepthem going.&quot;   Mr. Goldman believes Gov. Wilder can deliver that messagecredibly because he has come such a long way himself, workinghis way up the political ladder. &quot;The Rev. Jackson has takenanother approach,&quot; says Mr. Goldman. &quot;I just think peoplehave been more successful working their way up thanparachuting from the top of Mt. Everest. The Rev. Jacksonthinks he should start at the top.&quot;   Mr. Wilder's approach has won him some unlikely allies --including the conservative Democratic Leadership Council,among whose founders was Mr. Wilder's old nemesis, VirginiaSen. Charles Robb. &quot;His message, basically, is our message,&quot;says Al From, the DLC's executive director. &quot;He has done whatall successful Democratic politicians have done in recentyears. He has combined a progressive social approach withfiscal responsibility and toughness on crime. He's theparadigm of the new Democratic politician. He drives Jacksonup the wall.&quot;   But the battle for the Democratic mind and soul is farfrom over. It isn't just Mr. Jackson who objects to Mr.Wilder's mainstream convictions. It's many liberal whiteactivists in the party, too. &quot;The part they disagree withmost,&quot; says one leading Democrat, &quot;is fiscal conservatism.Many liberal Democrats believe now is the time to take someresources and apply them to problems.&quot; Many of theseDemocrats were in the audience when Mr. Wilder addressed theCalifornia state Democratic convention last month. It was theone occasion, so far, when he drew mixed reviews.</TEXT></DOC>
