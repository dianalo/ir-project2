 The most striking illustration of this to come tolight - it's clearly happened many times when the IBM watching community wasless vigilant - came at the June Consumer Electronics Show in 1983.andP;  The showopened over the weekend, and IBM had come right down to the wire in launchingPeanut, the PCjr home computer version of the Personal Computer at the show.andO;But at a meeting in Boca Raton on the Friday before the show was due to open,some of the IBM top brass felt uncomfortable that the machine was reallyright for its chosen market, and with just hours to go to the opening of theshow, where everything was in place for the razzmatazz launch, theannouncement was pulled.andP;  The machine eventually surfaced in November, toolate to make much impact in the Christmas market, which unlike 1989represented a massive boost to retail sales of home computers that year.andP;  Andthe machine that did come out was overpriced, underpowered and ungenerous inthe facilities that it offered.andP;  It had no doubt been configured that way tominimise the risk of self-impact, but the reaction of the market was to blowa loud raspberry, and the machine sank without trace within 15 months - andthe world learned the hard lesson that even the IBM name is not a guaranteethat users may find themselves orphaned.andP;  And for those pinning theircommercial hopes on the next generation IBM Unix RISC machines, history looksuncomfortably like repeating itself.andP;  The launch of the so-called Riosmachines is now hopelessly mired in IBM politics: almost universally expectedthis month after the launch was pulled last October, the launch date isbeginning to slip again, and some that think they are in the know do not nowexpect the launch before March.andP;  Despite all the talk of ensuring that enoughapplications are available before the thing is launched, the reason is almostcertainly the fear of self-impact, the mental gerontocracy in the ArmonkKremlin shivering in its collective shoes at a product carrying an IBM badgethat will lie on a dramatically more attractive price-performance curve thanthe AS/400, the 4381 and the 9370 - if it doesn't it will be hopelesslyuncompetitive with the offerings from DEC, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packardet al - and unleash the threat of revolution in all the core Soviets thathave kept IBM and its shareholders in the luxury to which they have becomeaccustomed.andP;  While the Armonkeys fiddle, the neglected RT Unix box has to besustained a little longer, so there are a couple of new offerings for it.andM;...adding Ingres 6 for AIX users...andM;IBM is releasing Ingres Inc's Relational Database Management System Version 6for its AIX implementation of Unix.andP;  The architecture has been redesigned tosupport a multithreaded processing environment, and with a server acting asthe common thread of access to the database engine or kernel, multiple userscan share a single back-end or central processing unit.andP;  However, theembedded preprocessor for Pascal is no longer available.andP;  Available onJanuary 26, the Ingres database Version 6 costs $3,250, Ingres/Applicationsis $975, and the embedded SQL preprocessor for Fortran is $488.andP;  Ingres/Netcosts $550, and Ingres/PCLink is $325.andM;...and a Unix transaction processing  system with CICSandM;links from VISystemsandM;IBM has had to go outside for a transaction processing system for AIX.andP;  TheVIS/TP Transaction Processing System is published and licensed by VISystemsInc, which is unfortunately not in Data Sources, so we don't know where thecompany lives.andP;  The software is offered through the Co-operative SoftwareProgramme for AIX Unix and is designed to provide an environment forexecuting and controlling on-line and batch applications, developing, testingand maintaining applications in C or Cobol, migration of existing CICS/Cobolapplications and VSAM data to Unix, and remote access to data distributed onother AIX Unix machines or data on the mainframe defined to CICS.andP;  It isavailable on both the RT and PS/2 under Unix; no prices were given; VIS/TP isavailable immediately in the US.andM;Stairs/CMS Version 1.2 in MarchandM;IBM has come out with only the second release of its Stairs Storage andInformation Retrieval System for VM users running CMS.andP;  Stairs/CMS Version 1Release 2 is claimed to help reduce costs and avoid delays associated withmanually handling data in document form.andP;  It interfaces to Officevision/VM,provides an Application Programming Interface and a sample dialogue program,andM;supports   documents  prepared  on  IBM  editors,  displays   setandM;switches,  and supprots the merging of as many as  16  databases.andP;  Available from  March  16, 1990, it carries  a  monthly  licence charge of $633regardless of 370 used.andM;X25 PS/2 Co-Processor Support ProgramandM;The X25 Co-Processor Support Program is designed to enable the 4684 Models111, 131, 161 point-of-sale terminals and the 8550, 8555, 8560, 8570, 8580models of the PS/2 to attach to an X25 Packet Switched Data Network whenequipped with an X25 Interface Co-Processor/2.andP;  It provides an X25Programming Interface to enable both IBM and customer developed applicationsto use public and private packet-switched data network communications3facilities.andP;  Not to be available until September 30, 1990, it will be $337.andM;Advanced NetWare 2.15 from IBMandM;Even IBM has to bow to the market dominance for Novell Inc's local networkoperating system, and the company is offering Advanced NetWare Version 2.15with support for communications between MS-DOS, OS/2, and Macintoshworkstations and network servers.andP;  New features include the facility to copyMacintosh files, and the NDIR command shows which files are Macintosh files.andO;The NVER utility shows the version of software running on the file server,and FLAGDIR permits the viewing or changing of sub-directories in a givendirectory.andP;  It carries a licence fee of $2,925.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
