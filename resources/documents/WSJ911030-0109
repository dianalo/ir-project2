The company's Marathon Oil group, however, posted sharplylower earnings, reflecting depressed natural-gas andcrude-oil prices and a difficult comparison with last yearwhen the Persian Gulf War inflated oil prices.</LP><TEXT>   USX earned $28 million vs. $163 million a year earlier.Sales fell 6.8% to $4.77 billion from $5.12 billion.   The U.S. Steel Group, which also includes other operationssuch as mining and real estate, earned $5 million, or ninecents a share, down sharply from $81 million, or $1.57 ashare, a year earlier. Sales fell 12% to $1.28 billion from$1.46 billion. The results include a pretax pension credit of$55 million, which means on an operating basis the steelbusiness lost $5 a ton. But that is a big improvement fromthe first half, when the company lost $90 a ton and $41 a tonin the first and second quarters, respectively, because oflost orders amid strike threats.   While steel-group profit was off sharply from last yearand shipments fell 15%, the results impressed analysts. &quot;Itwas a great performance,&quot; compared with that of its rivals,said John Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities. Other major steelmakers have posted, orare expected to post, third-quarter losses.   In spite of the typically slow third quarter, U.S. Steel'sorders in July and August reached near 90% of capacity, andaveraged 88% in the third quarter. Moreover, the companydidn't have any major costly repairs and it benefited fromthe start-up of a continuous caster at its Gary, Ind., plant,and the write-off of steel operations in Pennsylvania andIllinois this year.   U.S. Steel Group's fourth quarter should be even better,as sales increase and the price increase effective with Sept.29 shipments takes hold. The company's third-quarter priceswere 4% below last year's levels. One major fourth-quarterwild card remains: auto makers, who last year began cuttingback production schedules and canceling steel shipments.Moreover, world spot prices continue to fall in spite of highoutput, notes Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber.   Marathon earned $23 million, or eight cents a share, downfrom last year's level of $82 million, or 31 cents a share.Sales fell 4.7% to $3.49 billion from $3.66 billion.   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said world-wide crude pricesfell more than $4 a barrel from year-ago levels, whilenatural-gas prices were depressed.   Fred Leuffer, an analyst with CJ Lawrence who expectedMarathon to earn 15 cents a share, called the results &quot;verydisappointing,&quot; especially since nonrecurring gains addedseven cents a share in profit.   He attributed the poor results to several factors,including an 11.5% drop in natural-gas production, highercorporate expenses and a higher tax rate. Explorationexpenses also increased 15% from a year ago, and jumped 80%from the second quarter. Those exploration activities havepaid off, however, in a string of gas and oil welldiscoveries. Domestic oil production, while 2.2% higher thanlast year, was below first-half levels.   Results in the downstream operations -- marketing,refining and transportation -- also fell, reflecting thesluggish economy and its impact on demand at both theconsumer and factory levels.   Still, analysts noted that natural-gas prices have begunto rebound, as has oil demand, which should boost Marathonearnings in the fourth quarter.   Starting with the second quarter this year, USX beganreporting its steel and energy operations independently toreflect a stock restructuring into separate issues.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, USXSteel rose 37.5 cents a share, to $29.25, while Marathon fell$1, to $28.875.</TEXT></DOC>
