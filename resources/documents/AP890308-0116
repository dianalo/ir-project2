(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Supreme Court nominee Robert Borksays his grilling before the Senate in 1987 set a precedent for therough treatment that John Tower is getting in confirmation hearingsfor secretary of defense.   ``Of course I feel sympathy for him,'' Bork said Tuesday beforeaddressing 350 local Republicans. ``I think my episode set apattern. ... Those folks tasted a little blood.''   Senate confirmation of Tower has been jeopardized by allegationsof drinking and womanizing and concerns about his ties to defensecontractors.   Bork, nominated for the Supreme Court by President Reagan,testified for 30 hours over five days during his confirmationhearings, defending his conservative record and narrow reading ofconstitutional protections that enraged civil liberties and women'srights groups.   After listening to 112 witnesses over 12 sessions, the Senaterejected Bork's nomination 58-42. It was only the 11th time theSenate had voted against a Supreme Court nominee.   During a dinner speech, the former federal appellate judge said,``I think it's legitimate to ask if (Tower) has personal habits thatwill interfere with the performance of his duties.'' But he addedthat Tower should be confirmed because those habits did not preventhim from being an effective senator or compiling an impressiveresume.   Bork said there is a new ``venomous mood'' in the capital, and``Senate Democrats in a variety of ways are intent on taking overthe functions of the president.''   Bork left the bench in 1988 to ``debate, discuss how we shouldview the Constitution and how we should select judges.'' He isworking on a book that explores the intrusion of politics intoconstitutional law.</TEXT></DOC>
