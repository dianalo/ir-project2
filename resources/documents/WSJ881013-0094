Jobs is crouching on his knees in a chair in front of the video monitor of Next Inc.'s new computer. He has just finished a 20-minute demonstration of how the machine can help him create models of molecules, play digitized music, or, appropriately enough, look up the meaning of the word &quot;prodigality&quot; from its built-in dictionary.    &quot;So, what do you think?&quot; he asks almost breathlessly, with all the pride of a first-time father. &quot;Isn't it cool?&quot;    If nothing else, the Next computer was born to be shown off. From the cube-shaped black box that holds its electronic innards, to the sphinx-like monitor you can tilt at any angle with one finger, right down to the tiny, three-dimensional Next logos on every component, it is a masterpiece of industrial design. William H. Gates, the famed chairman of Microsoft Corp., calls it &quot;the most beautiful-looking computer I've ever seen,&quot; even though he and other Next competitors contend that it hasn't any special performance edge.    The machine's electronic circuitry is housed in the one-foot magnesium cube that sits under a desk. Engineers chose magnesium because it can dissipate heat well and can confine the electromagnetic radiation from the circuitry. The basic system includes eight megabytes of memory -- 12 times the memory that comes standard in most personal computers and twice that found in many workstations.    Its brain is Motorola Inc.'s most advanced conventional microprocessor, the 68030, the same chip that Apple Computer Inc. uses in its most powerful Macintosh computer and that Sun Microsystems Inc. and Apollo Computer Inc. use in many workstations. The Next machine also incorporates a math co-processor chip to handle number-crunching and a special chip called a digital signal processor that, with the proper software, can transform the computer into an electronic music synthesizer. These two chips, both also made by Motorola, free the 68030 to handle the graphics and other data processing.    A slim, black keyboard, with green and white letters and numerals, and a matching mouse pointing device plug into a 17-inch, black-and-white, high-resolution monitor supplied by Sony Corp. Although the machine can generate stereo sound when it is plugged into a stereo system, the computer itself provides one speaker housed under the monitor, which swivels on the desk.    &quot;We designed the monitor with the case arching over the top so it looks like a stage in a theater,&quot; says Hartmut Eslinger, an industrial designer for a company called frogdesign, of Los Gatos, Calif., which crafted the outward appearance of the computer's parts. &quot;The idea is to make a little play of the software performing.&quot;    But the machine's most striking standard feature is its magneto-optical drive, which can hold 256 megabytes -- roughly 100,000 typed pages on a single removable disk costing about $50. That's equal to the amount of information that can be held on about 320 floppy disks used by most International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Macintosh personal computers.    To overcome the slow data-retrieval times that plague most optical drives, the machine also has two unusually complex integrated circuits. The result is the biggest, fastest optical drive available to personal computer or workstation users.    The disk shipped with the machine will contain, among other things, a dictionary and thesaurus, a dictionary of famous quotations and the collected works of William Shakespeare, as well as a text-search program, a word processor and a mathematics program. The machine doesn't have a conventional floppy-disk drive.    &quot;Students will be able to accumulate the body of all their work during their whole college career and keep all the reference materials and software they need on a single disk,&quot; Mr. Jobs says.    The machine comes ready to plug into computer networks and uses MACH, a variation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s popular Unix operating system. Consequently, it can run much of the technical and engineering software that runs on other Unix machines made by Sun, Apollo, Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. And Next is offering an optional $2,000 laser printer that provides twice the printing quality of most other desktop laser printers.    Many academicians especially like the ease with which the computer can be programmed. Mr. Jobs contends that its &quot;object-oriented&quot; programming languages and &quot;interface building tools&quot; will enable programmers to write programs using snazzy graphics in one-tenth the time it takes to write similar programs on other Unix workstations and personal computers.    &quot;If the Next machine can really bring down the time to write a program from months to weeks, people won't care how much it costs. They'll buy it,&quot; says Raymond Neff, vice president for information services of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
