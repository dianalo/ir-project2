Briefing reporters on the overall request, Deputy Secretary ofState John Whitehead said the budget would provide for the firsttime since 1986 full funding of U.S. asssessed contributions to theUnited Nations and other international organizations.   Overall, the administration requested $14.8 billion in spendingauthority but planned to spend $13.2 billion of that during thecoming year.   The recommendations are subject to change because neither theincoming Bush administration nor the Democratic-controlled Congressis bound by them.   The proposal was identical in most respects to the 1989 budgetalthough the administration decided to proposal the disbursal of allmilitary aid on a grant basis. Historically, a portion of militaryassistance has been in the form of credits.   Among the new items in the budget were $50 million in spendingauthority for the U.N. forces that will oversee the transition thisyear of Namibian independence from South African rule and $20million for the U.N. peacekeeping for in the Persian Gulf.   Also included in the request was $46 million in partial paymentof prior year arrearages to the United Nations. Whitehead said thiswould be the first of several payments aimed at making up for $572million in cumulative arrears to international organizations.   Consistent with past practice, there was no request forassistance for the Nicaraguan Contras in the budget message. TheReagan administration routinely has treated that issue separatelyand made no recommendations for the incoming administration.   Israel was earmarked for $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2billion in economic assistance. The $3.0 billion total authorizationis the largest worldwide, exceeding the $2.3 billion recommended forEgypt, which would receive $1.3 billion for military purposes and$815 million in economic aid.   In other authorization requests, the major recipients were thecountries with which the United States has base agreements: ThePhilippines, $649.3, Turkey $613.5 million, Greece $350 million andPortugal, $177.6 million.   In Central America, major recipient countries included ElSalvador $386.1, Honduras $207.3 and Guatemala $158.6.</TEXT></DOC>
