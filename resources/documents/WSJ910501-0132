Paul Tsongas declared hiscandidacy for president and vowed to &quot;plant the seeds ofAmerica's economic renaissance.&quot;   The declaration of the former Massachusetts lawmaker, a50-year-old cancer survivor who faces formidable politicalodds, marked the formal beginning of the 1992 presidentialcampaign.</LP><TEXT>   In his remarks here and later at a renovated mill in NewHampshire, where the first presidential primary will be held,Mr. Tsongas sought to portray himself as a new product ofpolitical alchemy, a Democrat who is aggressively&quot;pro-business&quot; and an environmentalist who cares abouteconomic growth.   &quot;I commit myself to making this country a thriving,striving, triumphant competitor in the world marketplace,&quot; hesaid in a gloomy rain. &quot;I commit myself to an America whereour standard of living, our educational and health-caresystems and our industrial output are second to none.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas is the first Democrat to declare hispresidential candidacy in a race that, because of the victoryin the Persian Gulf war and President Bush's high pollratings, is getting off to an unusually slow start. By thispoint in the political season four years ago, sevencandidates had formally joined the 1988 contest; and formerDemocratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, a longshotcontender to whom Mr. Tsongas often is compared, had alreadyspent 21 days in New Hampshire and 31 days in Iowa, whichnext February holds the first presidential caucuses.   As have many candidates in the past, Mr. Tsongas, a formermember of the House and Senate, signaled that he will run forthe White House by running against Washington. &quot;We needleadership that embraces a higher vision,&quot; said Mr. Tsongas,who retired from the Senate in 1984 when he was diagnosedwith lymphoma, and subsequently fought a battle against theillness that included a successful bone marrow transplant,massive chemotherapy and radiation treatment. &quot;Today, thatleadership is not in Washington. That leadership is here andacross America.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas is calculating that two themes -- that he isan outsider and that he has borne witness to hardship -- willhelp him overcome his lack of a popular base of support oreven recognition among the nation's voters.   A former Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia and the WestIndies, Mr. Tsongas speaks easily of &quot;the obligation of mysurvival.&quot; He brought Dr. Tak Takvorian of Boston'sDana-Farber Cancer Institute both to Washington last monthand to New Hampshire yesterday to reassure those in politicalcircles that he is fit for the race. Last weekend, hecompeted in the YMCA Masters National 100-yard freestyle and100-yard breast stroke competitions.   Both he and his campaign aides deliberately avoided anyreference to the state's other prominent Greek-AmericanDemocrat, former Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis, who won the1988 Democratic presidential nomination but now is reviled inhis home state and among many national Democrats.   As a legislator, Mr. Tsongas was known for his casual mienand rigorous attention to detail. His nascent campaign showssigns of both. His announcement ceremony, one of the ritualsof politics, had a down-home air: His sister talked of herhopes of celebrating Greek Easter at Camp David, a formermayor of Lowell crooned &quot;God Bless America&quot; and a signhanging across the brick face of a mill spoke of thecandidate as &quot;our favorite son.&quot;   For weeks, Mr. Tsongas has been distributing copies of asomewhat breathless manifesto with the title &quot;A Call toEconomic Arms&quot; -- first in the form of an 83-page,single-spaced typewritten monograph and later in pamphletform. In this campaign blueprint, Mr. Tsongas scoldsDemocrats, warning that they won't be able to redistributewealth if no wealth is being created and espousing a numberof viewpoints that are unconventional and provocative forDemocrats.   Mr. Tsongas is calling for a reduction in capital-gainstaxes for some long-term investments, aresearch-and-development tax credit, an assault on globalwarming, a national energy policy that includes highergasoline taxes and renewed support for nuclear power.   But in his remarks yesterday in a setting where mill girlsof the 19th century lived together, sang the factory song andoperated machines that stitched a textile empire, he trodlightly on issues. He did call for the &quot;full funding&quot; of HeadStart but offered no other specifics. Instead, he seemed toluxuriate in difficulties his candidacy faces when heprepares to go, as did Lowell's other native son, JackKerouac, on the road.   &quot;I offer a different path,&quot; said Mr. Tsongas, who despitehis retirement from Congress remained active in Massachusettspolitics and government, even heading the Board of Regents ofHigher Education. &quot;Harder but more hopeful. Longer but morecompelling. Steeper but more worthy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
