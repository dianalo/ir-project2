In particular, the list ofthe measurement system identification, e.g. measuring instruments, sensorlocation, uncertainties, measurement identification code etc., has beenupdated and amended to include the identification codes for the computedparameters. The measurement identification codes, which also stand forthe identification of the corresponding measured quantities in engineeringunits, and the identification codes derived therefrom for the computedparameters have been adequately defined in the description of the measurementsystem identification.</TEXT></DOC>
