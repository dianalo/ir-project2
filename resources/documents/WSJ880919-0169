Although the unanimous vote was rare good news for Seabrook, opponents said they will launch new litigation to block licensing of the plant, idle since its completion in 1986.    Seabrook's owners called the NRC's new rule the &quot;last regulatory impediment&quot; to its low-power license. The decision &quot;moves Seabrook Station a giant step closer to operation,&quot; said Edward A. Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates Seabrook on behalf of the 11 New England utilities that own it.    Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which owns 36% of Seabrook, saw its bellwether 17 1/2% debentures, due 2004, close Friday at $48.875 per $100 principal amount, up 75 cents.    The new rule drops a requirement that nearby towns maintain accident-warning sirens during the period when the plant operates at low power.    Seabrook officials requested the rule change after neighboring towns in Massachusetts, which opposed the plant, dismantled their emergency sirens to block the Seabrook license. The commission ruled, however, that the sirens were unnecessary while the plant is at low power, when the chances of an accident are said to be greatly reduced.    The NRC expects the rule to become final in 30 days. After the NRC staff examines the plant and its procedures once again for safety, Seabrook could begin preparations for operating at 5% of power, to test the plant and train employees.    But opponents, for starters, plan to challenge the new rule in the federal appeals court, said James M. Shannon, the Massachusetts attorney general. &quot;We'll take this as far as we have to,&quot; he said. &quot;This could be tied up for years.&quot;    And whether or not the low-power license is granted, he will also push the commission to re-examine the financial condition of the Seabrook owners, to find them unfit to manage a nuclear plant. Public Service, the majority owner, filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors in January, and the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Corp., an 11.59% owner, has been negotiating with third parties to buy out its share of the project.    The NRC examined the owner's financial health during Seabrook's construction phase, an NRC spokesman said, and hasn't yet determined whether it will entertain that argument again.    Moreover, even if Seabrook is granted its low-power license, it would still require a full-power license for commercial operation. Mr. Shannon said he will argue in bankruptcy court in the Public Service case that it is unreasonable for Public Service to incur the costs of testing under the low-power license when its full commercial license is far from assured. Mothballing the plant, after the test phase when radioactive waste is created, will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. &quot;Why increase the costs to shut it down?&quot; he asked. </TEXT></DOC>
