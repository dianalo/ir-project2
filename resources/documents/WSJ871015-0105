Last week, almost four years later, both the federal government and Florida gave up efforts to prosecute a Seminole Indian chief on charges of killing a Florida panther, one of the world's most endangered animals.    In the little Idaho town of Kamiah a few days ago, anti-Indian anger erupted after a Nez Perce Indian, apparently within his legal rights, shot a bighorn ram considered a community pet.    And in Wisconsin, complaining sportsmen persuaded a congressman to introduce a bill that would revoke Chippewa tribal hunting rights bestowed by treaty 150 years ago.    From Florida to Washington state, Indians' broad hunting rights are under fire. One reason: Indians are making bold new court claims to their rights under old treaties. In addition, many people consider Indian hunting privileges out of step with the popular trend toward conservation.    Terming hunting rights &quot;a volatile issue in many states,&quot; Thomas Dougherty, Rocky Mountain regional executive for the National Wildlife Federation, a sportsmen's group, comments, &quot;What we're hearing from sportsmen's groups and affiliates is that with many game populations bouncing back as a result of sportsmen's money and efforts, they have strong feelings about uncontrolled harvest.&quot;    Apart from sportsmen, few people know that many tribes' hunting rights extend far beyond reservations to ancestral hunting grounds. There the Indians often are subject only to tribal rules and can ignore state hunting seasons and bag limits.    In central Idaho, the reservation for some 3,000 Nez Perce Indians spreads across about 150,000 acres of good deer, moose and bighorn-sheep country. But their ancestral hunting grounds to which they have treaty hunting rights, now mostly national forests, sweep westward into Washington and Oregon. Similarly, a 1983 decision by a federal appeals court gave six bands totaling some 9,000 Chippewas hunting rights on four million acres, roughly the northern third of Wisconsin.    Compared with regular hunting restrictions, Indians' privileges on off-reservation ancestral hunting grounds often are extremely liberal. The Nez Perce in Idaho recognize no bag limits or seasons. Charles Hayes, a member of the tribal executive committee, says that although they can legally hunt year-round, &quot;the majority follow the pattern set by ancestors. Our ancestors didn't hunt in the dead of winter or when animals were carrying young.&quot;    Even so, Indian practice diverges sharply from typical fall hunting seasons, which emphasize &quot;fair chase&quot; -- wildlife gets a sporting chance. In contrast, Indians and non-Indians agree, tribes hunt for meat, not recreation, and the difference is reflected in their hunting techniques. One such method: hunting late in the year when winter storms have driven deer, moose and elk down from the mountains into large groups in the valleys.    Some Indians' hunting tactics considered &quot;biologically unsound&quot; are especially criticized. &quot;They kill {elk} cows with calves by their side in June and July, and there's no rule against it,&quot; says Dwight Kilgore, an Idaho Fish and Game officer in the Nez Perce area.    Similarly, Wisconsin's regular deer season runs nine days, with the limit generally one deer and, in a few areas, two. The Chippewas, negotiating with the state, agreed to a four-month season, September through December. The Chippewa bands and the state also set the size of their deer harvest, but within that share Indians haven't any individual limits, and their spokesmen concede that some shoot 20 to 30 deer a season.    Some Indians hunt all four months but supply venison to others in the bands, says James Jannetta, an attorney for the Chippewas. He scoffs at the impact on wildlife. &quot;We're talking about the rights of a community of a few hundred Indian hunters compared with hundreds of thousands of others,&quot; he says. &quot;The Indian harvest in Wisconsin is less than the road kill.&quot;    However, George Meyer, enforcement administrator for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, notes, &quot;The courts even ruled the Indians could sell game and fish to the public.&quot; The state negotiated a temporary agreement under which Indians would confine wildlife commerce to bartering within the tribes.    The Indian harvest of game, often unmeasured, perplexes state officials who set seasons according to game populations as estimated by aerial surveys and other methods. Idaho's Nez Perce don't compile any game-kill figures, and &quot;we have no way to know what's taken by Indians,&quot; says Frank Nesmith, chief of law enforcement for Fish and Game. &quot;If there's a strong harvest by Indians, we come up with shorter seasons and less permits for non-Indians.&quot;    The bighorn killed by a Nez Perce recently near Kamiah was on private land within the reservation. The ram had taken a liking to the rocky slopes around the lumbering town, and the rare animal had become a local attraction. &quot;What upset me most was that it was an opportunity for people to see a bighorn sheep, and now it's lost forever,&quot; says Richard Bovey, a state fire warden whose home looked out on the ram's favorite territory. &quot;Under the treaty, the Indian had the right to do it. But having the right and doing right are two different things.&quot; Under Idaho law, only two bighorn rams are permitted in a hunter's lifetime.    In Wisconsin, treaties giving Indians special hunting rights are under attack. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. introduced a bill in Congress last July stating, &quot;Any off-reservation usufructuary right to hunt, fish and gather granted to any Indian tribe by any treaty, law or executive order which may be exercised in the State of Wisconsin is hereby abrogated.&quot; The Republican congressman says he seeks to abrogate &quot;expanded rights handed down by federal court.&quot;    Protect Americans' Rights and Resources, a Wisconsin-based organization that claims affiliates in 15 states, opposes Indian treaties generally. &quot;We want treaties abrogated because they are outdated and have been replaced by new opportunities and expensive programs to take care of needy Indians and non-Indians alike,&quot; says Larry Greschner, its executive director. &quot;We don't think the Indian should enjoy full benefits of citizenship and then claim to be a sovereign nation.&quot;    In Washington state, tribal victories in fishing cases have prompted the state to try negotiating to get Indians to restrict their hunting seasons voluntarily. &quot;We said we know you have the right to hunt on federal lands, but if you are willing to restrict hunting to biologically sound times and manner, we won't challenge your right to hunt on state lands,&quot; says Robert Rasmussen, Indian affairs administrator for the Department of Wildlife. Last season, five of the 20 tribes agreed.    The Florida panther case illustrates the complexity of such litigation. Bruce Rogow, attorney for Seminole Chief James Billie and a Nova University law professor, conceded that his client killed the big cat in December 1983. The case was thrown out of state court in 1985 for lack of jurisdiction but was reinstated in 1986.    This year, when the Justice Department prosecuted Chief Billie, Mr. Rogow argued that &quot;the U.S. Supreme Court has never held that the federal endangered-species act applies to Indian reservations.&quot; He also contended that the endangered status applied to only one species, that there are variations of the panther in Florida and that which one the dead panther belonged to isn't known. After a federal-court mistrial due to a hung jury, a state-court jury acquitted Chief Billie on a similar charge this month. &quot;It's clear Indians do have different privileges,&quot; Mr. Rogow says.    Some experts call litigating Indian cases a losing game. Says James Vaught, chief of law enforcement for New Mexico Game and Fish, &quot;We've been to the U.S. Supreme Court twice, been whipped both times and now we're sitting on the bench saying, 'If you want to argue with those Indians, more power to you.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
