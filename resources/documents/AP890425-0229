Millions of people in southern Africa are both barefoot andhungry these days, and though their leaders are reluctant to admitit, they depend on South Africa for commerce so conditions won'tget any worse than they are.   From war-ravaged Angola and Mozambique to tiny, overcrowdedMalawi, the region includes some of the poorest and least developednations in the world.   Almost a decade after nine black-ruled states joined forces inan ambitious effort to lessen their reliance on South Africa, theyhave yet to tap their economic potential and still are inextricablylinked to their southern neighbor.   ``In many ways the countries are worse off now than in 1980,''said Tom Kennedy, a South African-based researcher who recently dida study on economic conditions in southern Africa. ``Due to wars,bad internal policies and poor management, there's been very littleprogress in the region.''   The nine regional states are Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe,Zambia, Tanzania, Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, whichmake up the Southern African Development Coordination Council(SADCC).   SADCC concentrates on the region's two most pressing problems,transportation routes and food supplies. Since it was founded in1980, the organization has helped increase trade among memberstates, improved the flow of technology and research, and currentlyis involved in almost 600 projects that will cost some $7 billion.   But successes have been limited. Almost three-quarters of the 75million people in SADCC countries remain subsistance farmers andper capita income in the region is less than $500 a year, accordingto World Bank figures.   South Africa remains the leading trading partner for seven ofthe nine SADCC countries. Its roads, rails, ports, power stationsand communications networks are essential to their economicsurvival.   South Africa's 28 million blacks have higher average incomesthan in any SADCC country. More than a million workers fromneighboring countries earn their livings in South Africa, while thetraffic in the opposite direction is minimal.   The black-led countries want to reduce reliance on South Africanot only because they oppose its apartheid policies, but also totake advantage of potentially more efficient trade routes.   Malawi, where annual per capita income is about $200, spends anextra $100 million a year exporting its tobacco, tea and nutsthrough distant South Africa because railway lines in neighboringMozambique are mostly inoperative because of guerrilla sabotage,according to Kennedy's estimates.   Zaire, more than 600 miles north of South Africa, receives morethan half its imports via South Africa although it has its ownAtlantic Ocean port.   Five major railways connect landlocked nations of southernAfrica to the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.   However, four pass through Angola or Mozambique, where civilwars dating to the mid-1970s have halted or sharply reduced traffic.   ``The region will never have secure food supplies until we canmake these rail lines work,'' said Nkwaki Ng'wanakilala, aspokesman at SADCC's headquarters in Gaborone. ``And that won't bepossible until the fighting stops.''   The region's fifth rail line, which links Zambia to the port ofDar es Salaam in Tanzania, has been unaffected by war. But poormanagement has kept it from operating anywhere near full capacitysince it was built by the Chinese in the 1970s. About half its 75locomotives are out of service.   Farm-to-market roads throughout southern Africa range fromprimitive to non-existent. Crops in the fertile region often rot inthe fields.   The region has the potential to feed much of the continent, butfarmland is often under utilized. Farmers are almost exclusivelysmall-scale growers with little training, equipment or access togovernment services.   Zimbabwe is the only SADCC country that has more than 100private commercial farms of several hundred acres or more,according to regional agricultural officials.   The Southern African Economist, a magazine published by SADCC,noted that regional governments ``blame the decline in foodproduction on a host of factors ranging from adverse weather,escalating costs of fertilizers and longer transport routes todisruption of agriculture by South African-backed terrorists.''   But, it added, the ``blame also lies with the governmentsthemselves, for maintaining subsidies and setting unrealisticproducer prices which give farmers no incentive to produce more.''   Despite the gloomy picture, there have been two recentdevelopments that could strengthen southern African economies inthe long-term.   South Africa has been trying to improve relations with blackAfrica and expressed eagerness to cooperate on developmentprojects. It has agreed to grant independence to Namibia and saysit has stopped supporting guerrilla movements in Angola andMozambique.   SADCC has estimated that South African military actions in theregion have cost more than $10 billion during the 1980s.   The more peaceful climate has eased the international pressurefor sanctions against South Africa, which inevitably would damageits neighbors as well.   Also, several countries have begun to pursue market-orientedeconomies and are moving away from ``African socialism'' andcentralized economies.   Tanzania, long hostile to free enterprise, has been implementingausterity measures backed by the International Monetary Fund sincePresident Ali Hassan Mwinyi came to power in 1985.   ``IMF conditionalities are painful,'' Mwinyi said last year.``But we have to make a choice between two sharp-pointed spears. Itis either we go forward with shops full of expensive commodities orwe revert to the days of empty shops.''   Malawi has pursued similar reforms, while Mozambique andZimbabwe, both officially socialist, are talking less aboutideology and offering some encouragement to foreign investors.   At present, SADCC's only economic standout is the arid nation ofBotswana, where diamond wealth has transformed the country from oneof the poorest in the world into one of Africa's wealthiest statesin 22 years of independence.   The economy has been growing at roughly 10 percent a yearthroughout the 1980s and Botswana has foreign reserves of $2.3billion, equal to South Africa's.   The government's formula has been a commitment to freeenterprise, support for foreign investors and a fiscal policy thatis probably the most conservative in Africa. Officials warned ofspending curbs this year when the projected budget surplus dippedbelow $200 million.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 7</NOTE></DOC>
