Pilots who disobey orders to land would face up to five years inprison under the proposal, contained in the administration's newanti-drug bill, the Los Angeles Times reported today.   The proposal would let the Customs Service, Coast Guard and themilitary do ``everything we can short of shooting the bad guysdown,'' an unidentified administration official told the newspaper.   Authority to shoot down planes has been proposed by Sen. MitchMcConnell, R-Ky. But the administration said that option posed anunnecessary risk to innocent pilots.   Currently, U.S. pilots who intercept suspected drug smugglersover American airspace have no authority to force planes to land.They can only follow them until they land, when a search ispermitted.   Authorities have complained the restriction allows smugglerpilots to drop drugs into the United States with little fear ofprosecution.   The administration bill, which is to be unveiled Wednesday, hasgenerated concern that authorities could force innocent pilots toland and submit to searches.   ``We're all for efforts to stop drugs, but you have to bereasonable,'' said Cheri Farha of the 300,000-member AircraftOwners and Pilots Association.   The Customs Service has devoted 100 planes to drug interdiction,the military 50 planes and the Coast Guard 10 aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
