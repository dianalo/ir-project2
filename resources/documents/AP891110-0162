In greenhouse tests, corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percentin plants inoculated with the naturally occuring microorganism,according to a statement released by Crop Genetics International ofHanover, Md.   ``This is the first time that a plant has been able to grow itsown genetically-engineered pesticide in its vascular system,'' thecompany said.   The borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the U.S. corn crop,the company said. U.S. farmers annually lose 200 million bushels ofcorn worth $500 million to the borer.   ``If it proves to be effective, if it can be easily used and itis not too costly it will do Minnesota farmers a lot of good,''said Ken Ostlie, a University of Minnesota entomologist.   Minnesota lost an average of $107 million worth of corn to theborer from 1981 to 1983, years in which borer infestation wasparticularly bad, Ostlie said.   The microorganism, whose scientific name is Bacillusthuringiensis, is harmless to humans and animals, making itpreferable to chemical pesticides, according to the company, whichspecializes in developing biological pesticides.   ``Our InCide vaccine is environmentally more attractive thansynthetic chemical pesticides,'' said company chairman John B.Henry.   A prototype of the vaccine was field tested in several states. Anewer, more potent version was effective in greenhouse tests and isscheduled for field trials in Maryland next summer, the companysaid.   The bacteria already is being used as a pesticide by beingapplied on corn in granular form, Ostlie said.   Researchers are concerned about whether the borers would becomeresistant to the toxin if it goes into widespread use.</TEXT></DOC>
