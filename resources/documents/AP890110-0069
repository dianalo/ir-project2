(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The knife used in the 1987 slaying of aprostitute is identical to the one found near the bodies of sevenwomen discovered weeks later on a hillside in a remote area, aprosecutor said.   Dayton Leroy Roger is serving a life sentence for theprostitute's death and faces trial next month in the slayings of sixof the seven women. The seventh victim has not been identified.   The prosecution disclosed Monday that the bodies of the sevenwomen were nude and that their legs and feet had been sawed off.   Information about the knife and the condition of the bodies wasrevealed at a Clackamas County Circuit Court hearing on pretrialmotions. Roger's trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 6.   The seven young women, all known or suspected prostitutes, wereabducted, mutilated and stabbed to death and their bodies dumped ina remote area near Molalla, about 30 miles southeast of Portland.   Rogers, 35, was charged with six counts of aggravated murder.   Deputy District Attorney Andrejs Eglitis said the knife was found``a matter of feet'' from four of the victims. He characterized theknife as ``identical in size and shape'' to one Rogers admittedusing to kill Jennifer Lisa Smith.   Smith, a Portland prostitute, was tortured and stabbed to deathin a parking lot of a suburban Portland restaurant a few weeksbefore the bodies were found near Molalla in August and September1987.   Rogers told jurors last year he killed Smith in self-defense, buthe was convicted of aggravated murder.   Among the motions considered by Judge Raymond R. Bagley Jr. was adefense request to suppress certain evidence, including the knife,that Eglitis said would be important to his case.   Eglitis said there were knife wounds in the bodies of some of theMolalla victims that were consistent with the type of wound thatwould be made by Rogers' knife.   ``There is every reason to believe that knife is the one thatcaused the wounds on the Molalla victim,'' Eglitis said.   Rogers' attorney, Christopher Burris, argued that no human bloodor tissues were found on the knife and that it would be inflammatoryto introduce it as the probable murder weapon.   Burris also argued against the introduction of bones from thelegs of the Molalla victims. The bones, he said, had ``tool marks''showing they had been sawed from the bodies.   Eglitis said the tool marks proved that the bones weren't severedfrom the bodies by foraging animals.   During the Smith trial, several former prostitutes testified thatRogers has a foot fetish and was sexually fascinated with the archesof women's feet.   Burris also asked to supress a hacksaw taken from Rogers' smallengine repair shop. Eglitis said the saw could have been used to cutthe women's legs.   The judge made no immediate rulings on the motions.</TEXT></DOC>
