I'd buy them two for a nickel,&quot; Kongsaid, laughing.;    &quot;I used to sell newspapers to the tourists and then I'dask them if they could give it back when they were done and I'd go to theother street corner and sell it.&quot;;    Openness to the press and the strongties with the surrounding community seem to be trademarks of Kong's tenure aspresident of the College of Alameda.;    &quot;We have never not been able to talkwith him. I don't think we've ever been stonewalled by him where a story maybe touchy or negative as opposed to positive,&quot; said Tom Tuttle, editor of theTimes-Star, Alameda's local paper.;    And they are practices Kong said he'llbring with him to San Jose when he takes over as chancellor of the SanJose/Evergreen district on July 1.;    The 53-year-old administrator, who hasserved as president of the College of Alameda since 1989, was chosen earlierthis month to replace the district's current chancellor, Richard W. Goff, whowill retire in August.;    In doing so, Kong is also making history. He is thefirst Asian-American to head the college district in its 17-year history.;   As chancellor, Kong will be responsible for overall administration of thecollege district. He will carry out the wishes of the board of trustees and beheld accountable for all action and operations within the district.;    &quot;I'mexcited about the prospect of leading San Jose/Evergreen, but I have mixedfeelings about leaving (College of Alameda),&quot; he said.;    And it is withregret that many at the college will see him depart.;    A table in his officeis littered with congratulatory cards and a computer printouts of messagesfrom staff members.;    &quot;There are very mixed feelings (about his departure).We're disappointed that we're losing him, on the other hand we know that ourloss is San Jose's gain,&quot; said Don Kechely, spokesman for the college.;   &quot;He's a wonderful administrator. He's on top of everything,&quot; he added.;   Added Rita Haberlin, who has taught geography at the school since 1975 andserves as president of the academic senate: &quot;He's extremely hard-working. Yousee him working till 6:30 or 7:30 p.m. and on Saturdays as well. He's reallyactivated the faculty.&quot;;    Some at the college credit Kong with the recentrises in enrollment at the school. They say his community outreach program hasnot only brought students in but has made the college a part of thecommunity.;    &quot;I think that's where he'll be missed the most. We are known somuch more in the community because of him,&quot; said Haberlin.;    The College ofAlameda is the second largest of the four colleges in the Peralta CommunityCollege District. Total spring quarter enrollment was 5,800, Kechely said. TheSan Jose/Evergreen district has a combined enrollment of 24,000.;    Kong is afirm believer in the system he heads. All five of his children have attendedcommunity colleges.;    &quot;I think it's an old-time stigma that communitycolleges are seen as extensions of high school that allow smoking,&quot; he said.;   Kong has already given thought to projects he'd like to tackle when hearrives in San Jose.;    &quot;I want the message to get out that students have agood opportunity to get to a four-year university from a community college,&quot;he said.;    Kong is a third-generation Chinese-American, the first of threechildren, who was born and raised in Hawaii.;    Kong began his career ineducation as a faculty member before moving on to administrative duties. Hetaught biology, botany, ecology and marine biology at schools and colleges inHawaii, Oregon and California.;    He received a master's degree in sciencefrom Oregon State University. He served as president of Irvine Valley Collegein southern California before taking his current post at the College ofAlameda.;    Kong will earn almost $25,000 more as the head of the SanJose/Evergreen district. District spokeswoman Martha Lucey said thechancellor's salary was set at about $105,000 when trustees began the searchfor Goss' successor last year.;    But Kong says it's not the money thatpersuaded him to make the jump.;    It's the challenge of overseeing two verydifferent colleges and &quot;moving them forward into the future.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LORI ARATANI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910424  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  783  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 24, 199100115077,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
