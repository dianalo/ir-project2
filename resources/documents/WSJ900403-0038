Only about 1% of pesticides are put on lawns, but theyraise special concerns. Children play the most on grass, andthey're &quot;the subgroup of the population most susceptible&quot; totoxins, notes Susan Cooper, an ecologist with the NationalCoalition Against Misuse of Pesticides, an environmentalgroup. Last week, the U.S. General Accounting Officeunderscored concerns by charging that the lawn-care industryexaggerates pesticide safety.   Organic offerings include everything from books, such as&quot;The Chemical-Free Lawn,&quot; published last year by RodalePress, to rapidly biodegradable pesticides. Rincon-VitovaInsectories Inc., Oak View, Calif., says its aphid-eatingladybugs and other insect stand-ins for chemicals are flyingoff the shelf.   NaturaLawn Inc., a Damascus, Md., organic lawn-careconcern, &quot;had to {temporarily} cut off sales last yearbecause we couldn't handle all the business we were getting,&quot;says Phil Catron, president. NaturaLawn occasionally useschemical herbicide on some tenacious weeds, Mr. Catron says.But part of the organic approach, he adds, &quot;is educatingpeople that having a few weeds is not that big a deal.&quot;   Mainstream yard-care concerns also are getting into theact.   ChemLawn Services Corp., Columbus, Ohio, says it'stest-marketing a program that uses manure for fertilizer andno pesticides. Bartlett Tree Experts Co., Stamford, Conn.,offers an option featuring precisely timed spraying andpest-attacking insects. The method cuts chemical use by morethan 90%, says Donald Booth, a Bartlett manager.   Enlisting a Clay Pit   To Store Solar Energy                                                                                                          ENGINEERS at the University of Massachusetts are planninga solar energy system based on clay.   The team plans to capture heat from the sun during thesummer with solar collectors and use it to warm a100-foot-deep clay deposit near the school's Amherst, Mass.,campus. In winter, the stored energy would provide as much as80% of the heating for a new convention center near campus.   The technique, which could overcome the difficulty ofstoring solar energy, was explored by the the U.S. Departmentof Energy in the 1970s as a way to heat homes, says teamleader Edward Sunderland. But heat leaked out of therelatively small systems too fast. The Amherst system's muchlarger 100,000-cubic-meter clay deposit is expected to retainand give back more than 85% of its stored heat, says teammember Dwayne Breger.   The system would employ six acres of solar collectorssimilar to rooftop water heaters. The collectors would heatwater, which would be pumped through underground pipes lacingthe clay to warm it. In winter, the warm clay would heatwater to 140 degrees Fahrenheit before it is pumped to theconvention center.   The system's estimated cost of about $3.5 million would berepaid by fuel savings in five to seven years, Mr. Bregerprojects. The engineers, whose design work was funded by theDOE, now are seeking funds to build the system. It would be aU.S. first, but some 30 such systems already have been builtin Europe, they say.                                                                                                          Ecology Groups Waver   Over Seals of Approval                                                                                                          IT'S A FAUSTIAN dilemma that's shaping up for someenvironmental groups.   Many of them recently have been approached by retailersand other concerns proposing to use the groups' names andlogos in product promotions. The companies are offeringroyalties or other kinds of payment and a chance for thegroups to spread their messages among consumers. &quot;Right now,we're being deluged&quot; with such proposals, says RosemaryCarroll, the Sierra Club's director of development.   Some groups already make such deals: The Audubon Societylicenses its name to makers of binoculars and birdseed. BlackSheep Marketing Inc., New York, pays a 25% royalty to theRainforest Alliance to use its name in inserts with showercurtains picturing rain forests. The World Wildlife Fund haslicensed its name to a maker of T-shirts featuring endangeredspecies.   But other groups are wrestling with issues raised by theproposals and haven't yet decided how to handle them. &quot;Ourname could lose all meaning if we don't protect how it isused,&quot; says Ms. Carroll of the Sierra Club, which is nowdeveloping a policy on the matter. For example, she adds, thegroup probably won't sign a pact with a company that wants topromote its plastic-free tampons with the Sierra Club.                                                                                                          Introducing the Annual   `Green Con Award'                                                                                                          THE LONDON OFFICE of Friends of the Earth has initiated anannual &quot;Green Con Award.&quot;   The environmental group wants to spotlight examples of&quot;companies jumping on the green bandwagon when in fact theyare talking gibberish,&quot; says a Friends spokeswoman. The firstwinner was British Nuclear Fuels PLC for &quot;railing about howgreen nuclear power is,&quot; she says.   A British Nuclear spokesman says its recently developed adcampaign stresses that nuclear plants, unlike conventionalplants, don't pollute the air. &quot;We maintain nuclear powercould contribute to lessening the greenhouse effect,&quot; hesays.   He added that &quot;we don't agree with the criticism that weare deceiving people. But we derived some amusement from theaward. We would have displayed the trophy in the pressoffice, but it's so hideous nobody wanted it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
