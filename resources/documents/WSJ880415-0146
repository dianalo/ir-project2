Nine years ago, facing the possible extinction of its third largest employer, the UAW gave major wage and benefit concessions to Chrysler Corp. It was the first time the union broke with the sacred practice of continuously higher living standards and consistent contracts across the Big Three auto makers. As a labor-movement leader, the UAW's actions opened the gates for sacrifices by many other unions.    Now Chrysler is coming off four straight years of billion-dollar profits. So when negotiations begin Monday for new national contracts covering 51,500 active hourly and 5,600 salaried workers, the UAW expects to end up with a contract that for the first time in a decade will mirror precisely those at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.    &quot;Since 1980 we've been in the process of bringing the Chrysler section of our union back to full pattern,&quot; says UAW President Owen Bieber. &quot;And we intend to complete that this time.&quot;    Company officials worry that while they may not be asked do anything more than their domestic competitors, such a contract could put them at a further disadvantage to the growing group of low-cost importers as well as Japanese companies that will reach full production in the U.S. by the 1990s. Chrysler's top bargainer, Anthony P. St. John, publicly says &quot;our goal is to reach a strike-free settlement that recognizes the unique needs of Chrysler and its employees.&quot;    But privately, company executives acknowledge they will have little choice but to swallow whole the Ford and GM contracts signed last fall. That should make the process relatively quick and painless. Negotiators for both sides project wrapping it up sometime next month.    Lingering hostilities and mistrust, however, could derail a settlement. The 1985 talks were considered simple and predictable at the outset, but broke down into a 12-day strike-Chrysler's longest in 35 years -- over wage disputes and general miscommunications. While a walkout doesn't seem possible this spring, negotiators could abruptly break off talks and return for a confrontation when the contract expires Sept. 14.    Between 1979 and 1985, GM and Ford negotiated three contracts; Chrysler and the UAW went to the table eight times. Half those sessions ended in deeper and deeper concessions. The others involved struggles between the company and the union -- and the union leadership and the rank-and-file -- over how much the workers should get back. Eventually, Chrysler workers got provisions similar to their industry brethren. But the contracts had different expiration dates, which ensured some differences.    In this round, the union wants to wipe out the last vestiges of discrepancy. The UAW does have some unusual demands that stray far from plowed ground, such as tying worker profit-sharing payments to executive bonuses, and adding three more UAW seats to the one it already holds on the Chrysler board. But those aren't likely to go far.    In general, the UAW leadership has so far resisted, even in pre-bargaining rhetoric, membership pressure to push for more. Asked last week if the union wanted any major changes from the GM and Ford agreements, Mr. Bieber said, &quot;No. The agreement that we'll go to the table with is a pattern agreement.&quot;    The union's official public position, for example, includes no demands for base wage raises. It wants a new two-year pact expiring simultaneously with Ford's and GM's in 1990, and it only wants lump-sum payments in each of those years, similar to the final two years of the Ford and GM agreements, which were negotiated last fall. Chrysler assembly-line workers currently make $14.43 an hour.    The main thing the union is interested in is immediate coverage under job security plans in place at the other auto makers. Chrysler, which already employs the lowest number of workers per car of the Big Three, would be hard pressed to reject that. The union also wants a profit-sharing formula similar to those at the other manufacturers.    Another factor that should smooth the process is simply the diminishing importance of the national contract. Chrysler's main labor concern these days is getting local unions to adopt &quot;modern operating agreements&quot; that reduce restrictive work rules in the plants.    Indeed, Mr. St. John says, &quot;our No. 1 objective is to move out of these negotiations into non-adversarial activities,&quot; like joint union-management quality programs. Chrysler agreed to start the talks early, he says, so &quot;we can then put what I'd call the adversarial activities surrounding labor negotiations behind us and move on with our joint cooperative efforts.&quot;    Despite the apparent simplicity, there are potential pitfalls. One is simply the complications that always arise in applying even a pattern contract to the unique structures of individual companies.    Another is the militance of Chrysler's work force. Twice in the past six years, the rank-and-file have taken the unusual step of rejecting contracts bargained by the leadership. There are rumblings that workers will demand a sweeter package than Ford or GM -- perhaps in the form of the $2,120 per worker signing bonus Chrysler employees got in 1985 -- as the price of peace.    The main concern, however, isn't policies but personalities. During Chrysler's bankruptcy scare, the company and the union actually grew quite close. &quot;Adversity brings two sides together,&quot; says Douglas A. Fraser, the UAW president who dealt with the Chrysler crisis.    But Marc Stepp, a UAW vice president leading the Chrysler talks, has repeatedly complained in recent months that labor relations at Chrysler are now at their lowest point in 30 years. </TEXT></DOC>
