The software concern, which employs about 4,000 workers,said its new policy requires gay and lesbian couples seekingto qualify for corporate family benefits to sign affadavitsattesting they have marriage-like relationships. Among otherstipulations, partners must attest that they are each other's&quot;sole spousal equivalent and intend to remain soindefinitely,&quot; that they reside together and that they areresponsible for each other's welfare, said Russ Campanello,vice president, human resources.</LP><TEXT>   Lotus's new policy represents &quot;a trend that seems to begrowing in the private sector,&quot; said Ivy Young, director ofthe National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's families project inWashington. She added that a &quot;large West Coast university&quot; isexpected soon to adopt a similar policy. Lotus's Mr.Campanello said that officials with 10 large U.S. companiescalled Lotus last week to ask about details of its newpolicy, which was first disclosed Friday in the Boston Globe.He added that in researching precedents for the policy, helearned that about 30 companies are &quot;looking at&quot; adoptingsimilar ones.   Ms. Young said that Montefiore Medical Center, in NewYork, was the largest non-government employer that previouslyadopted a similar policy. The hospital, which employs about9,000, extended family benefits to homosexual couples inMarch 1991.   A scattering of nonprofit concerns and smaller companiesalso have adopted such policies, including Ben andamp; Jerry'sHomemade Inc., Waterbury, Vt.; the American PsychologicalAssociation; Greenpeace; and the American Civil LibertiesUnion. Municipalities that have extended benefits tounmarried &quot;spousal equivalents&quot; include Berkeley, Calif., andSeattle.   Lotus's new policy won't extend benefits to unmarriedpartners of heterosexual employees, said Mr. Campanello.Unlike homosexual couples, heterosexual ones have the optionof state-recognized marriage to qualify for corporate familybenefits, he said. The company's new policy represents an&quot;issue of fairness and equality,&quot; he added. &quot;We're trying tolevel the playing field.&quot;   Mr. Campanello said Lotus extensively researched for overtwo years how such policies work elsewhere. &quot;Like everybodyelse, we're concerned about benefit costs,&quot; he said. &quot;Butwe've seen no increase in costs&quot; for other employers with thepolicies.   In particular, he added, worry about increased benefitcosts from spousal equivalents with acquired immunedeficiency syndrome appears overblown. &quot;A typical AIDS casecosts about $50,000 a year,&quot; he said. By comparison, typicalcosts of a heart attack case are about $45,000 a year, andcancer cases &quot;can cost far more.&quot;   An estimated 10% of Lotus's employees are homosexuals;less than half of such employees are expected to qualify andapply for family benefit coverage, Mr. Campanello said.</TEXT></DOC>
