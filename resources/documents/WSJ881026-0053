Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F </CO><IN> AUT </IN><TEXT>   When William Birchall ordered 50 Ford pickup trucks earlier this year for the Georgia-Pacific Corp. fleet he runs, he expected to wait a few weeks for delivery. Months later, he still couldn't get his trucks. Ford simply didn't have them.    So the frustrated Mr. Birchall demanded the forest-products company's money back and bought an assortment of Chevrolet, GMC and Dodge trucks instead. &quot;We just can't put up with not getting the vehicles we were promised,&quot; he says.    Ford Motor Co. is selling many of its cars and trucks faster than it can make them, even with its factories grinding out all they can on overtime. It's a problem many companies -- including flailing General Motors Corp. across town -- would love to have, and it pales beside the overcapacity and idled factories that threatened Ford's survival in the early 1980s. Nonetheless, the current difficulty is not only costing Ford sales but also straining its workers and machinery alike.    Defects have jumped 75% on the Lincoln Town Car, following last summer's assembly-line speedup at the Wixom, Mich., plant, which builds Ford's luxury cars. On some days, the repair pit at the end of the plant's assembly lines is jammed with cars missing parts because, some workers say, they fall behind in their work.    Ford, in short, is struggling with success. Thus, the company, the nation's biggest industrial success story of the late 1980s, now stands at a crossroads. How it fares in the 1990s will rest largely on its strategies for adding plant capacity, developing new products and modernizing &quot;power trains,&quot; the engines and transmissions. Success in all three is far from certain, but critical.    Power trains are the crack in the foundation of Ford's tremendous surge in sales. Catchy styling and better quality have fueled those gains, but Ford still must catch up with competitors on engines; it lacks the latest technology to simultaneously improve performance and gasoline mileage. Engines in the Tempo/Topaz compacts, for example, are modified descendants of the Ford Falcon's in 1961.    In product development, Ford wants to play leapfrog instead of catchup, but that game is even trickier. Ford is reviving its &quot;world car&quot; concept of designing automobiles in one place for sale around the globe -- an idea that flopped a decade ago and is producing cost overruns and design compromises this time around.    Plant capacity, as Mr. Birchall's experience suggests, is the issue of the moment. It's producing an intense debate over whether and when to build new factories, a debate reflecting the contention between the confident and the cautious inside the &quot;Glass House,&quot; Ford's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.    The confidence shows through in many ways: The 1989 Thunderbird is the first in that model's 34-year history to sport Ford's familiar blue oval logo; previously, officials worried that the Ford logo would hurt the car's upscale image, but now they believe it will help. And last month, Ford refused to follow GM in making a major warranty change, broadening the coverage but shortening its duration; that's a striking departure for a company long accustomed to &quot;following the General.&quot;    Ford executives, moreover, are even talking of what two years ago was unthinkable: one day topping GM in sales (Ford's profit has been larger for two years running). &quot;Hey, we can now say it isn't as ridiculous as you might have thought five years ago,&quot; says Louis R. Ross, the executive vice president for North American auto operations. &quot;And maybe in five or 10 years, it could happen.&quot;    But at the same time, Ford is haunted by its own past troubles -- it closed three assembly plants in the early 1980s -- and by GM's current troubles, an unnerving illustration of how the mighty can fall. Besides avoiding construction of new factories for fear they might one day sit idle, Ford has yet to make an oft-promised major acquisition despite a $10 billion cash hoard that may be a U.S. corporate record.    &quot;The biggest danger is overoptimism, not underoptimism,&quot; says Allan R. Gilmour, who heads international operations. &quot;We have always gotten excited when things have been going well and frequently have done things we shouldn't have.&quot;    Such comments aren't the only ones that smack of the hawks-vs.-doves debate that permeates Ford nowadays. &quot;There may be too much of a fear that if we get bigger we will get careless again,&quot; says Peter J. Pestillo, vice president for employee and external affairs. &quot;We might be at the point of taking a chance or two.&quot;    But Donald E. Petersen, Ford's quiet, strong-willed chairman, talks in dovish terms: &quot;My argument is that what's called a conservative game plan has proved to be a very winning formula for this company.&quot; (And a winning formula for Mr. Petersen as well; he was just voted the nation's most effective business leader in a Fortune magazine survey of chief executive officers, edging out Chrysler Corp.'s Lee A. Iacocca.)    One reason for Mr. Petersen's caution: He knows that Ford's good fortune stems from luck as well as skill. GM's many miscues have helped enormously, but Ford can't continue to count on them.    What's more, only Ford's poverty in the early 1980s kept it from downsizing several aging models -- the Lincoln Town Car, Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford Mustang -- that appeared headed for extinction three years ago. Now, to Ford's surprise and delight, those cars have rebounded in popularity. It recently earmarked $50 million to patch up the 70-year-old Mustang assembly plant; both the plant and the car had been scheduled to die.    &quot;A lot of voices at Ford said, 'Get rid of the Town Car and Mercury Marquis because those dinosaurs are going to sink in the swamp,'&quot; recalls Robert A. Lutz, an executive vice president at Ford until two years ago and now a co-president of Chrysler. &quot;So it wasn't all terrific foresight.&quot;    Fully aware of all this, Ford recently launched the annual review of its manufacturing needs. And executives wanting to build more plants will clearly have to do some persuasive talking.    &quot;I don't see {the need} right now,&quot; says Harold A. Poling, Ford's vice chairman and chief operating officer. &quot;You have to see sustained demand for a period of time to justify the investment.&quot;    How much time? Mr. Poling doesn't answer that question, even though Ford's market share has climbed throughout this decade. It grabbed 21.7% of U.S. car sales in the first nine months of this year, up from just 16.6% in all 1981. Its share of light-truck sales, including minivans, also has increased steadily, to 30.1% so far this year.    Yet Ford worries that, after five fat years for the auto industry, a slump is due in a year or two, just as more Japanese assembly plants open in the U.S. Besides, Mr. Poling notes, Ford is raising its capacity to make crucial components -- it is seriously short of automatic transmissions for trucks -- and has already added the equivalent of nearly three new assembly plants in the past three years.    In Europe, where Ford's capacity is equally strained, the company is equally cautious about building new plants. Instead, it is considering the addition of a third shift in plants that run on two now, creating a special weekend shift or hiring temporary weekend workers.    The company's U.S. capacity has been increased partly by joint projects with Japanese auto makers, the latest of which is Ford's recently announced pact with Nissan Motor Co. to jointly build minivans in Ohio. Ford has also modernized its existing factories to increase their productivity. &quot;Productivity is capacity,&quot; Chairman Petersen says. &quot;It's that simple.&quot;    But it is also simple to see that Ford's caution carries costs as well as benefits. Ford could grab perhaps an additional 2% of the U.S. truck market and nearly 1% of the auto market if it had more production capacity, its executives concede. This year, the shortage of capacity may have cut Ford's sales by some 200,000 vehicles and its revenue by about $2 billion.    That loss of sales irks many dealers who can't get all the cars or trucks their customers want. Ford dealers in rural areas of Texas and California, for example, report almost black-market conditions for hard-to-find new full-sized trucks. Ford's tight supply has also made its dealers less willing to accept even the sticker price on popular models such as the Ford Probe, the Lincoln Continental and certain light-duty trucks.    Thus, Ford needs to get maximum production from the plants it does have. That's especially true of the Lincoln plant in Wixom, which, like most Ford plants, runs 20 hours a day -- two 10-hour shifts, including two hours of overtime each. The most profitable auto plant in North America, it alone earns $1 billion a year.    Last summer, following installation of a new paint system, the plant increased production to 47 cars an hour from 36. But a quality survey taken soon afterward found that defects on the Lincoln Town Car built there jumped to 368 for each 1,000 cars from a low of 210 two years ago.    Along the assembly line, workers are discouraged from using the red &quot;stop&quot; buttons, which they're supposed to hit if they spot defects. &quot;If we see problems on the cars, supervisors don't want us to write them down on repair tickets because they'd lose cars,&quot; says Rick Horne, a worker. &quot;They have quotas to meet.&quot; Workers also complain that when they suffer minor injuries -- such as a ripped-off fingernail or back spasms -- they're told to keep quiet and keep working.    Ford says its internal studies show that its overall quality hasn't slipped, and it contends that the rise in the defect rate at Wixom simply indicates more meticulous inspections. It adds that it stuck with its two-week, companywide production furlough last summer to give workers and plants a break.    Nonetheless, several executives concede that the production system is strained and that Ford soon must decide whether to build a new assembly plant, probably for trucks. &quot;Our problem is that we are very obviously close to the need, and some {Ford executives} are more convinced than others,&quot; says Philip E. Benton Jr., who heads world-wide auto operations and is widely considered a likely successor to Mr. Petersen as the chairman that will have to deal with Ford's problems. &quot;Once we make the step, which we inevitably will at some point, this will be behind us.&quot;    What will still lie ahead, though, are the enormous engineering tasks, which Mr. Benton oversees, in power trains and product development. He views improvement of the power trains as especially urgent, even though the deficiencies in Ford engines haven't hurt sales so far. The new Lincoln Continental is a smash hit although its six-cylinder engine competes against Cadillac's more powerful V-8s.    Ford's top priority is to develop its own multivalve technology. Standard engines have two valves per cylinder; one lets in air before the fuel burns, and the other expels the exhaust. With more valves per cylinder, up to a total of four, the explosion powering each piston gains much more force. So, multivalve engines step up power without sacrificing fuel economy.    Such engines are now standard on the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla and optional on some GM cars. The Ford Probe sports three valves per cylinder, but that engine is made by Ford's Mazda Motor Corp. affiliate. The new Taurus SHO (for Super High Output) has a 24-valve V-6, but it's made by Yamaha Motor Co.    &quot;This technology is all of a sudden descending on us,&quot; Mr. Benton says, &quot;and we've got to redo our engines.&quot; That job will take at least until the early 1990s, and Ford officials are keeping their fingers crossed until then.    If all goes well, Ford's new engines will power a new generation of &quot;world cars.&quot; The cars are supposed to produce huge cost savings by avoiding the need to develop, separately and from scratch, slightly different cars for different parts of the world. Ford tried the idea with the Escort subcompact a decade ago but divided responsibility for the car between engineers in the U.S. and Europe. Each group made a slew of deviations from the basic plan, and the two different Escorts, while both successful, wound up with just two common parts, a water-pump seal and a suspension component.    That won't happen again, Ford executives say, because it won't divide the responsibility for each category of automobile. Instead, the small cars will be developed solely in Japan by Mazda, medium ones by Ford in Europe, and large ones by Ford's U.S. engineers. The new Escort, code-named CT20, will be the first to hit the market, with a 1990 debut.    But at the moment, the CT20 is $700 a car over budget. The reason: Mazda engineers have specified many parts made by certain suppliers in Japan, and, with the yen's surge, those parts now cost far more. Ford is reviewing the car part by part to look for savings.    Meanwhile, the new-generation Tempo/Topaz compacts, due out in 1994, are running into a more familiar problem: the differing demands of U.S. and European marketing people. The cars are being developed by Ford of Europe, which calls its version the Sierra. The European engineers want a slightly larger car than the U.S. engineers because the car is sold as a family sedan there.    The Europeans also are specifying 13-inch tires, which are ideal for maneuvering along Europe's narrow roads. But &quot;Americans don't like that roller-skate look,&quot; complains one Ford manager in the U.S. His colleagues prefer 14-inch tires, a seemingly small difference that would require a lot of different parts. The two sides are negotiating. &quot;We can get a common car,&quot; this manager says, &quot;but nobody will be really happy with it.&quot;    Nobody, perhaps, except customers, who might not notice the dozens of little compromises so important to the engineers. That, at least, is what Ford is counting on; its executives believe that consumer tastes in Europe and the U.S. are converging. &quot;When you have markets coming closer together,&quot; says Mr. Gilmour, the international operations chief, &quot;it makes sense to develop a car for a single segment once and use it in both.&quot;    Ford may well prove equal to all the challenges. However, the magnitude of what it must do explains why nobody at Ford is especially sanguine even though its stock price has more than tripled in just three years. What isn't widely understood outside Ford, Mr. Benton says, is that &quot;our No. 1 job is pulling off this huge effort we have scheduled for ourselves.&quot;    ---   Ford Motor (NYSE; Symbol: F)   Business: Second-largest auto company in U.S., also has aerospace and finance subsidiaries   Market Value: ......................... $25.07 billion   Number of Employees:   1987 average: ......................... 350,300   Number of Shareholders:   June 29, 1988: ........................ 265,240   Revenue: (Year ends Dec. 31)   1987 .................................. $71.64 billion   Change from '86: ...................... +14%   Net Income:   1987 .................................. $4.63 billion   Change from '86: ...................... +41%   Earnings Per Share:   1987 .................................. $8.92   1988 forecast: ........................ $10.76   Latest Quarter E.P.S.:   June 30, 1988: ........................ $3.43   June 30, 1987: ........................ $2.90   Price/Earnings Ratio: ................. 5.2   Auto industry average: ................ 6.9   Indicated Dividend Yield: ............. 4.6%   Auto industry average: ................ 4.4   Options Traded on CBOE   ---   What the Analysts Are Saying:   Wall Street generally likes Ford Motor Co. better than GM or Chrysler, but analysts aren't enthusiastic about the stock. The reasons: Ford's biggest earnings gains may be behind it, and auto stocks aren't the best buys in the year or so preceding a recession.    &quot;It's hard to see Ford's profits reaching much higher,&quot; says analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Ford, he says, lacks the capacity to sharply boost vehicle production, because its plants already are running flat out.    Ford has the equivalent of $20.80 a share in cash, which is a big plus for a stock that closed Tuesday at $54.625. Analysts also say the company is well positioned to weather a recession. But they add that investor uncertainty about how the compay would fare in a downturn is holding the ratio of Ford's stock price to current earnings to five, less than half the ratio of 12 for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500.    &quot;A lot of people are waiting the see what happens to Ford whenever the other economic shoe drops,&quot; says analyst Maryann N. Keller of Furman Selz Mager Dietz andamp; Birney. &quot;I'm not pounding the table telling people to buy auto stocks, even though Ford looks like a great one to hold for the long term.&quot;    ---    Analyst's Ratings:        10/9/88         Month ago    Stong buy                    7                7    Buy                          4                4    Neutral                      5                6    Sell                         0                0    Strong sell                  2                2    Total analysts              18               19    following company   Source: Earnings forecast and analysts' ratings by Zacks Investment Research. </TEXT></DOC>
