AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. government will go after thepersonal assets of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and his friends andcompanies he controls in stepping up its drive against thePanamanian leader, U.S. officials said Friday.   They said Washington is compiling a list of companies andindividuals associated with Noriega to block their assets and affectthem financially by keeping them from doing any kind of businesswith U.S. individuals, agencies or companies.   ``We are going after Noriega's cronies and firms he is identifiedwith,'' one U.S. Embassy official told The Associated Press,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Officials said the list will be made public within days and wouldinclude dozens of firms.   In its efforts to force the ouster of Noriega, whom it accuses ofdrug trafficking, the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions onPanama last year. The measures include withholding tax payments,freezing Panamanian government assets in the United States andrefusing to pay Panama Canal tolls.   The total amount retained by the U.S. government is estimated atclose to $300 million.   But the sanctions have failed to budge the general, who ascommander of the Panamanian Defense Forces is the most powerfulindividual in the country. The Defense Forces include both themilitary and the police.   Opposition leaders have said the U.S. sanctions affect low-incomegroups by aggravating the economic crisis.   The U.S. Embassy official said the new strategy was moreselective and avoided measures that hurt the Panamanian population.   On Friday, Michael Kozak, deputy undersecretary of state forLatin American affairs, said in Washington that the United Statesintended to ``put pressure on firms and friends of the regimewithout damaging the economy.''   President Bush said the United States will not recognizeFrancisco Rodriguez, the provisional president named by thePanamanian government, because his appointment was the work ofNoriega.   The U.S. Embassy source said, ``We can make it illegal for anyU.S. firm and individual to deal with any Panamanian company ownedby an associate of Noriega or by Noriega directly or indirectly.''   This could mean a loss of millions of dollars by Panamaniancompanies that do business with U.S. government agencies like themilitary Southern Command and the Panama Canal Commission.   The Southern Command's installations are home to nearly 14,000U.S. military personnel and it spends millions of dollars on foodand other items. The Panama Canal Commission has nearly 8,000employees, which also means millions of dollars in maintenance andcontracts and purchase of parts locally.   The U.S. official said one company already targeted by the U.S.government is an export-import company in the Colon free zone thatat one time was run by Carlos Duque, former presidential candidateof the government coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
