Gen. Prosper Avril seized power in a coup,radio stations reported.   At least three people were killed in the streets during thenight, the stations said. Nine other people have been reportedkilled in the past two days.   After a night of gunfire and violence in the streets of thissprawling capital, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men ofthe downtown fourth company arrested their commander, Maj. RenaudSymbert, and deposited him unharmed in front of the downtown armyheadquarters, the radio stations said.   The stations said gunfire was heard at the army compound inMirebalais, about 25 miles northwest of the capital as soldiersmutinied against their commander, Lt. Simeon Francois. Thelieutenant fled.   On Monday, troops of the elite 300-man Leopards Battalionhandcuffed their leader, Col. Abelard Denis, to the entrance ofarmy headquarters. Firing automatic weapons triumphantly into theair, they sped in vehicles back to their compound near the wealthysuburb of Petionville.   Soldiers of the 160-man Aviation Corps also briefly detainedtheir commander Monday before expelling him from their base inPort-au-Prince.   Avril, previously army adjutant general, proclaimed himselfpresident Sunday after a coup ousted Lt. Gen Henri Namphy, who ranHaiti for most of the 2{ years since Jean-Claude Duvalier wasforced into exile in February 1986.   Radio reports said police detective Henri Toussaint was shot andkilled, as were three unidentified brothers of Commander RolandChavannes of the traffic police.   Gunshots filled the air all night and into the early hourstoday. A government official, who asked not to be identified,blamed the violence on ``uncontrollable elements.'' Gunmen cruisedthe streets firing into the air. Haiti's new military governmentissued a communique Monday calling on the populace to remain calmand not seek vengeance.   Avril told the nation he had appointed a mostly civilian Cabinetthat would ensure a transition to democracy, but made no mention ofplans for free elections.   The new military ruler announced during an installation ceremonycarried Monday by state-run television that he had named 11civilians and one army officer to the Cabinet ``for the definitiveinstallation of democracy.''   ``We have our minds set on rising above parties and rivalfactions to attain national reconciliation,'' Avril said.   But opposition leaders have been skeptical of the new government.   Radio stations earlier reported that mobs on Monday killed threesuspected members of the Tonton Moucoutes, a feared band of thugswho were loyal to the Duvalier family dictatorship that ruled for29 years until Jean-Claude's departure.   The stations said the killings apparently were in reprisal for aSept. 11 church massacre in which unidentified hoodlums killed 13people and wounded 77.   Six other such mob killings were reported Sunday.   Bernard Degraff, the government's assistant information officer,said a realignment of the army would be announced shortly and wouldinvolve the transfer, promotion and retirement of an unspecifiednumber of army officers.   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe high command appeared to be delaying the military reshuffle toassert its authority over the non-commissioned officers who led thecoup.   Sources said that despite initial reports to the contrary, Lt.Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man DessalinesBattalion, would not be elevated to armed forces commander inchief. Paul has been indicted on drug charges by a federal court inFlorida.   Degraff identified the army officer appointed to the new Cabinetas Col. Carl Dorfainville, who was named interior and defenseminister, replacing Maj. Gen. Williams Regala.   The government spokesman described Dorfainville as a politicalmoderate. He had been military commander of the west department ofHaiti.   Among other members of the new Cabinet were veteran diplomatSerge Eliecharles, who becomes Haiti's new foreign minister.   Other appointed Cabinet members identified by Degraff were thehistorian Remy Zamor, minister of education; economist LeonceThelusma, finance minister; journalist and teacher Anthony VirginieSaint-Pierre, information minister; and Arnault Guerrier, ministerof social affairs.   Guerrier formerly was administrative director under Jean-ClaudeDuvalier, Namphy's provisional junta and Manigat.   Other members of the Cabinet were not immediately identified.</TEXT></DOC>
