The current quarterly reportfocuses on the same problem for a low sodium Beulah Lignite, which hassimilarities to the previous coal, but has a lower sodium content anda slightly different composition. Results are somewhat unsettling, sincethey did not conform to those observed for the high sodium coal. Furthermore,this difference could not be explained by the lower sodium value alone.Clearly, the effect of temperature quench on alkali metals depends notonly on combustion conditions, but also on the details of how the metalis initially bound in the mineral matter of the unburned coal. 12 figs.,5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
