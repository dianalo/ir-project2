Under the proposal, presented by Treasury Secretary James Baker in secret negotiations with the so-called Group of Five countries, the major powers would establish &quot;reference ranges&quot; -- broad upper and lower limits for the dollar, the West German mark and the Japanese yen -- and then intervene in the foreign-exchange markets if their currencies approach those limits. The talks also include Britain and France, the other members of the Group of Five.    U.S. officials caution that it still isn't clear whether the allies, particularly West Germany and Japan, will accept the plan. Negotiations have been going on for several weeks, and so far both those countries have declined to go along with U.S. demands that they stimulate their economies as part of any pact.    Indeed, the dollar suffered one of its worst tumbles in more than a year yesterday as traders brushed off a report of the U.S. offer and concentrated on remarks by Mr. Baker on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show yesterday that no special meeting of the Group of Five countries had been scheduled.    The dollar fell nearly 4% from intraday highs against major European currencies, ending a three-day rally that had been based in part on expectations that such a meeting would produce an agreement to support the dollar.    As of late yesterday, neither West Germany nor Japan had agreed to the U.S. terms, but officials here stressed that the talks are continuing and that an agreement still may be possible. The existence of a U.S. plan was disclosed by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak and confirmed by U.S. officials yesterday.    If the major powers can work out an accord in the next few days, Mr. Baker and his counterparts in other finance ministries could meet as early as Saturday or the following weekend to approve the complex agreement. If they don't agree, the finance ministers probably will discuss the issue again at their next regularly scheduled meeting, to be held here just before the opening of the April 9 spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee.    The major reason the finance ministers' meeting has been delayed so far has been that the U.S. has been unwilling to attend such a session unless it can be sure the meeting would produce some meaningful result. Mr. Baker said in his television appearance yesterday that &quot;you shouldn't hold a meeting that you don't think is going to be successful.&quot;    But there also are indications of resistance to a meeting from other members of the Group of Five. At a routine meeting yesterday of Common Market finance ministers, the &quot;clear tone of remarks&quot; indicated that Britain, France and West Germany saw no need for a meeting before the scheduled April session, according to one source. The issue wasn't explicitly discussed by the ministers, officials said.    Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who headed yesterday's session, said all 12 Common Market states would welcome any action to encourage stability on foreign-exchange markets. &quot;We want to bring an end to the erratic behavior of the world's reserves,&quot; he said. But he wouldn't comment directly on the possibility of a Group of Five meeting.    If the major powers do adopt &quot;reference ranges,&quot; it would mark the first major step back toward fixed exchange rates since the Bretton Woods system -- under which countries maintained relatively rigid currency values -- was abandoned in 1973. That system couldn't withstand pressures resulting from raging inflation and the massive oil-price increases of the 1970s.    There was no indication of what ranges the Group of Five countries would use if they agree to any new system to help stabilize exchange rates. However, speculation is that any new reference ranges would have as their center exchange rates similar to those that have prevailed during the past two weeks. They also probably would have relatively vague upper and lower limits so that monetary authorities would have some flexibility in administering them.    Mr. Baker has been trying for some time to persuade West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies. Last May, the Treasury secretary pushed through a proposal at the seven-nation economic summit conference in Tokyo to set up new international machinery to help the industrial democracies coordinate their economic policies more closely. It was hoped that would help stabilize exchange rates. But progress has been relatively slow.    However, such efforts have taken on a new sense of urgency, in part because there is increasing evidence that unless West Germany and Japan agree to further economic stimulus, they won't grow as rapidly as the U.S. If they don't, the U.S. will continue to buy more of their exports than they buy from the U.S., exacerbating the huge trade imbalances among the three powers and making it very difficult to stabilize exchange rates.    Moreover, U.S. officials worry that further declines in the dollar could stifle already weak growth in West Germany and Japan. The lower the dollar goes against the mark and the yen, the less competitive West German and Japanese goods become. While that helps U.S. exports, it could become self-defeating if it slows the allies' economies -- and thus their demand for U.S. goods -- by crimping too severely the exports on which they depend.    West Germany has been particularly hesitant about stimulating its economy in return for an exchange-rate stabilization arrangement. Bonn fears that stimulating more growth would risk rekindling inflationary pressures. Japan has been more willing to consider such moves, but so far hasn't signaled it is ready to act.    The Reagan administration's proposal represents a major shift in the previously stated U.S. policy on the dollar. Until now, U.S. officials have asserted that it's too early for the world to move back toward a fixed exchange-rate system.    Many U.S. officials also have contended that a reference-range system -- a somewhat more flexible version of the &quot;target-zone&quot; system some analysts have proposed -- wouldn't work unless governments are willing to alter their basic economic policies whenever their currencies get out of line. So far, few governments -- including the U.S. -- have been willing to do so.    Under the system proposed by Mr. Baker, reference ranges would provide early-warning signals to show governments that some policy changes are needed. Under a more-rigid system, the governments would be forced to alter their policies to prevent exchange rates from getting out of line.    Most analysts contend that even with a reference-range system, the dollar wouldn't remain stable unless West Germany and Japan actually stimulate their economies and the U.S. intensifies its budget-cutting efforts. They say Washington also would have to spur more investment and savings.    The U.S. experimented with a modest form of reference ranges following an accord last Oct. 31 between Mr. Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Although the two sides denied it at the time, they apparently agreed to try to hold the yen's value to roughly 150 to 163 to the dollar. But Washington made no promise to intervene regularly in the foreign-exchange markets to maintain such exchange rates, and Japan failed to take any major steps to stimulate demand at home.    Since then, Mr. Baker has been trying to persuade West Germany to join in a broader accord that would include the dollar, the yen and the mark -- and possibly the British pound and French franc as well.    The U.S. has been trying to persuade the West Germans to speed up a multibillion-dollar tax-cut that Bonn now has scheduled for 1988. It also wants Japan to increase government spending for housing and other industries; Japan's latest budget provides hardly any stimulus at all.    The push toward some kind of system of reference zones has long been a dream of Mr. Baker and Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman. More recently, however, it has won the backing of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. Earlier, Mr. Volcker was among those who was skeptical of any reference-zones plan.    In pushing the dollar down yesterday, traders totally ignored the report of the U.S. proposal for a currency-stabilization pact. &quot;If we can't even agree to an agreement to meet, then we've got to be a long way from agreeing on any kind of target zones,&quot; said James T. McGroarty, vice president of foreign exchange at Discount Corp. of New York.    Mr. Baker's televised comments, meanwhile, revived sentiment among currency traders that the Reagan administration is still intent on talking the dollar lower to help the competitiveness of U.S. industry in world markets.    &quot;Every time the dollar moves higher, there's a statement out of the administration&quot; undercutting the currency's strength, said Mr. McGroarty. Despite Mr. Baker's repeated denials that he's talking the dollar down, &quot;we wouldn't be at 180 (marks) if he wasn't on the Today Show,&quot; Mr. McGroarty said.    By late New York trading yesterday, the dollar had dropped 2.9% from Friday to stand at 1.8075 West German marks, down from 1.8610. The dollar was also down 2.9% to 1.5243 Swiss francs, from 1.5695, and down 1.5% to 152.08 Japanese yen, from 154.35. Earlier in the day, in Asia, the U.S. unit traded as high as 1.8760 marks and 1.5838 Swiss francs.    &quot;We had a complete collapse of the dollar,&quot; said Carmine Rotondo, vice president of corporate foreign-exchange at Security Pacific National Bank, New York. &quot;I think the rally is over,&quot; he said.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 152.20 yen, up slightly from its late New York quote.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
