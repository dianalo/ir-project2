Tokyo stocks, meanwhile, declined amid profit-taking and concern about higher oil prices. The Nikkei stock average fell back from Tuesday's record.    In London, the 100-share index surged 31.5 points, to a record 1722.2. That surpassed the previous high of 1717.6, set last April 3. The 30-share industrial index rose 18.7 points, to 1353.0, below its record of 1425.9, also set April 3.    One broker said the market was &quot;catching up after a long Christmas and New Year.&quot; He said stocks were being supported by Wall Street's strength and a steady British pound. &quot;I had very few sell orders,&quot; he added.    Another broker said the market is experiencing a start-of-the-year surge. He said pension funds and investment funds generally put new money into shares as each year begins. The funds spend a few days assessing stocks, he said, which explains the hesitant tone in the market earlier this week.    The London market has &quot;a good feel to it&quot; and has &quot;further to go,&quot; he added.    Insurance shares rose sharply yesterday, catching up with a rally in other financial issues earlier this week.    The gold mines index inched up 0.7 point, to 316.3.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average, which on Tuesday rose 116.21 points to a record 18936.76, declined 94.39 points yesterday, to 18842.37. The stock exchange index fell 5.88 points, to 1587.74.    Volume rose to 530 million shares from 460 million shares Tuesday.    Traders said an early rally, sparked by pharmaceutical stocks, fizzled following afternoon newspaper reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering changes in production quotas to further raise oil prices. One trader noted that share purchases had slowed by late morning, encouraging investors to cash in the gains of the prior two sessions.    Shares of companies dependent on exports fell because of expectations that protectionist legislation will be approved in the U.S. Utilities fell because of the oilprice speculation.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                   Jan 6    Jan 5     Year   U.S. ......................... 238.2    237.6    +18.5   Britain ...................... 501.6    498.7    +20.4   Canada ....................... 340.0    336.6    + 8.3   Japan ........................ 966.9    956.6    +61.4   France ....................... 414.7    405.5    +52.5   Germany ...................... 260.1    258.2    + 5.4   Hong Kong ................... 1792.8   1766.8    +51.5   Switzerland .................. 205.0    204.1    + 5.6   Australia .................... 274.1    269.8    +47.6   World index .................. 368.2    365.0    +43.5</TEXT></DOC>
