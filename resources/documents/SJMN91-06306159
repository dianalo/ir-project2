Forum's treatment of the Family HealthFoundation of Alviso (Mercury News, Oct. 19). If R.J. Reynolds is allowed topromote its product without much restriction, the same should apply to thefoundation.;   You said R.J. Reynolds had Camel advertisements and promotionnearly all over the Mexican Independence celebration, while the foundation hadjust two posters. The foundation had to take the posters down because theywere offensive to the R.J. Reynolds people. Why is it OK for corporations tomarket disease, but it is not OK for community, and other, groups to promotewell-being and good health?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  G.I. FORUM CAN MANAGE WITHOUT CAMELS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Apparently, R.J. Reynolds is a big donor of funds to the G.I. Forum. Webelieve this is why G.I. Forum took down the posters and told the foundation'srepresentatives that they weren't allowed to display that type of message.;  We also believe the foundation had the misfortune to have its booth directlyacross from R.J. Reynolds. We also had a booth at the same festival and wedisplayed a tobacco- and alcohol-awareness theme. Our booth was further awayfrom R.J. Reynolds' and the liquor booths. No one ever approached us to takedown our posters. In fact, the foundation gave us its posters that G.I. Forumtook down. If displaying those posters truly was improper conduct, why weren'twe told to take ours down?;   The G.I. Forum likes to think of itself ashelping the community, especially the Latino community. How can it help thecommunity when it is allowing corporations like R.J. Reynolds to marketdisease without rebuttal? This issue is not, and should not be, one-sided!;  We understand money is difficult to come by, especially when trying to raiseit through donations and sponsorships. We ask the G.I. Forum not to take theeasy way out. Why not try and raise the money through more positive means?Corporations like IBM, Apple, Pacific Bell and many others give money to fundthese types of events. Also, other groups such as the Hispanic group from PGandamp;Eand the Hispanic group from ATandamp;T have money and can help out.;   The G.I.Forum is a good and positive community group, but even groups such as thesecan become misguided. It is our purpose, as part of that community, to letthem know when they are.;   -- Irene Salazar; Paul A. Cabral Jr.; and fourothers; -- Latinos Toward Positive Advancement  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911101  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  414  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 1, 199100306159,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
