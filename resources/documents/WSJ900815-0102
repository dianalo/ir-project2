Patterson   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/15/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   LABOR GM</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)</IN><LP>   FLINT, Mich. -- General Motors Corp. settled a potentiallycrippling strike here by agreeing to postpone a planned plantshutdown for five years to allow time for most workers at thefacility to reach retirement age.   The pact, which contains stronger job security guaranteesthan at any other Big Three operation, could become a modelin the current bargaining for a nationwide agreement betweenGM and the United Auto Workers union. That's because itbalances union demands for job security with GM's desire topare its aging work force. GM officials have said thatretirement and attrition could solve much of the company'scurrent overstaffing problem, provided the union agreed toallow the shrinkage to take place over several years.</LP><TEXT>   Following a six-day walk out, workers at a unit here ofGM's A.C. Rochester division approved the contract and itsfive-year offer of job security by a 97% margin.   The job security promises -- never before made for longerthan three years -- satisfied workers. Only a day earlier,the workers had vowed to hobble GM's North Americanoperations indefinitely to dramatize their distress overplans to shut down a portion of their plant and lay off 600workers by 1992.   According to the agreement, GM will guarantee the jobs ofall 3,108 workers employed at the plant, including the 600employees targeted for layoff and another 600 whose jobs werelost to outside suppliers. The auto maker also agreed tospend $21.3 million upgrading equipment in the plant and toseek out other components that workers could build at theplant.   Some top union officials expressed surprise at how far GMcame their way. &quot;We didn't anticipate coming out with thetype of agreement that we got,&quot; said Reuben Burks, the UAWregional director and an executive board member of the UAW.   But UAW officials were quick to seize on the precedent.   &quot;What's been done {here} should be a model for thecorporation,&quot; said Michael Grimes, the top union official atthe AC plant.   GM had powerful reasons to settle this dispute quickly.The A.C. Rochester plant supplies 55% of the gas tanks forGM's North American vehicle operations, as well as othercritical components.   Because most GM plants don't stock heavy inventories ofparts in an effort to hold down warehousing costs, it wasonly a day after the A.C. Rochester picket lines went up thatGM was forced to close two assembly plants. Three more closedover the weekend, and another closed yesterday. UAW workerswere scheduled to go back to work at the Flint parts plantlast night. It was unclear whether any more assemblyoperations will have to shut down before the supply lines arerefilled.   Still, GM's agreement to postpone the closure of one ofthe five operating units at the A.C. Rochester facility wasan unusual step, particularly in light of the trouble the GMhas had making its vast parts-making operations competitive.   GM Chairman Robert Stempel, at the outset of nationalbargaining talks last month, cited the high cost of partsthat GM produces for its own cars as a key competitivedisadvantage. GM builds a higher percentage of its own partsthan either Ford Motor Co. or Chrysler Corp.   GM had planned to cut 900 jobs at the A.C. Rochester plantover the next two years, a reduction of about 29% from thecurrent work force. But now those plans are on hold until atleast 1995.   The five-year promise may be all GM needs to make. Theaverage age of workers at the plant is 47 years and theaverage senority is 24 years. Many workers are like LevertisWynn, who has worked for GM for 25 years and will have enoughseniority to retire in five years. &quot;I feel better now than Idid before, because I still have a job,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
