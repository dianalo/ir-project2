By now, the most sensational revelations contained in hischronicle of greed, lust and ambition at the Israeliintelligence service, the Mossad, have been well publicized.Among the charges: that a top-secret arm of the Mossad with24 to 27 veteran officers is spying in the U.S. and that theMossad failed to give the U.S. a detailed warning about animpending truck-bomb attack that killed 241 Marines in Beirutin 1983.</LP><TEXT>   And yet, even if Mr. Ostrovsky's charges prove true, theyare hardly surprising. After all, it's not unusual even forfriendly nations to spy on one another and refuse to shareinformation. (In the case of the Marines, the Israelis didapparently pass on a tip, without many specifics so as not toendanger their sources.) Instead, Mr. Ostrovsky's burst ofcelebrity has largely come as the result of a heavy-handedattempt by the Israeli government to ban the publication ofhis book, &quot;By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of aMossad Officer&quot; (St. Martin's Press, 336 pages, $22.95).   According to Mr. Ostrovsky, two Mossad agents visited himat his home in Ottawa in the hopes of persuading him not topublish. First they appealed to his patriotism; then theyoffered to bribe him. Finally, he says, they threatened tokill him.   As a last resort, the Mossad headed for courtrooms inCanada and the U.S., winning a temporary order barring St.Martin's from selling the book. It was a publicist's dream.The first printing of 50,000 copies sold like Le Carre, afteran appeals court overturned the order. All this seems to bepropelling what is essentially a clumsily written tale,co-authored by Canadian journalist Claire Hoy, to thebest-seller lists.   It is not that the Mossad didn't have some reason forconcern. Mr. Ostrovsky liberally names Israeli agents andreveals details about the Mossad's communication codes. Butsome of the fuss is probably distress at Mr. Ostrovsky'stiming. Created in the wake of Israel's 1948 War ofIndependence, the Mossad was seen as ruthlessly devoted tothe survival of a country surrounded by hostile neighbors. Inrecent years that reputation has been tarnished by politicalscandal and the spectacle of former Israeli operativesselling their services to the highest foreign bidder,including Colombia's Medellin drug cartel and Panama's ManuelNoriega.   Mr. Ostrovsky's is not an isolated voice in the call forgreater public accountability and openness by the Mossad. Butas a raconteur of the agency's misdeeds his credibility isopen to question. The first scene, in which the Mossad pliesan Iraqi scientist with money and prostitutes in an attemptto get information about Iraq's nuclear complex, takes placeeight months before the Mossad even attempts to recruit Mr.Ostrovsky.   It is never satisfactorily explained how Mr. Ostrovskycame by his intimate knowledge of events with which he had nodirect contact. Apparently, he had access to classifiedMossad computer files. But that doesn't explain how Mr.Ostrovsky reconstructed entire conversations and theinnermost thoughts of agents luring targets into their traps.   Mr. Ostrovsky inspires more confidence with his fact-heavyfront-line view of agent training. The story lumbers, but youbelieve it when he describes how aspiring spies learndiscipline from beatings and other forms of humiliation.There is practical training, too; the cadets learn how towrite secret messages, develop covers and follow people. Theyspend their evenings scattered in apartments around Tel Aviv,building secret cubbies for their documents and practicingcover stories.   These earnest Mossad agents are no James Bonds, althoughsome of their sexual exploits as recounted by Mr. Ostrovskysuggest a high degree of physical fitness. They don't evenget to play with high-tech gadgets, but are taught how toexploit human weaknesses, using money, sex or pressure to getwhat they want.   What's missing from the account is any sense of how Mr.Ostrovsky feels as he slowly becomes, in his words, a conartist for his country. Perhaps spies not inhabiting a LeCarre novel are not introspective by nature, but Mr.Ostrovsky claims to have kept a daily journal of hisexperiences. Instead, he offers what read like transcripts ofevery lecture he heard during the lengthy training.   Mr. Ostrovsky is equally cursory when describing hisouster from the Mossad. The &quot;unmaking&quot; of Mr. Ostrovsky takesonly a few pages as he describes how he was made a scapegoatfor a failed 1986 attempt by Israel to capture PLO leaders byforcing down a private jet flying to Libya. That'sunfortunate because Mr. Ostrovsky manages to sidestep thelarger issue of whether he, or any spy, can ever be truly&quot;unmade.&quot; He merely offers a sly admonishment near the end ofthe tale: &quot;You can't always take a spy at his word.&quot;   ---   Ms. Marcus is a staff reporter in the Journal's New Yorkbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
