Suddenlythe man claps his hands loudly and pulls out a huge net, trapping ahalf-dozen of the birds as they try to fly away.   He throws them into a box in the back of his tan station wagonand heads off to New Jersey, where the pirated pigeons will be soldfor a few bucks each.   That is the modus operandi of a 74-year-old Brooklyn man whoauthorities say has been trapping and reselling pigeons for thepast decade.   Agents of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animalsrepeatedly have issued him summonses, but judges have thrown outthe charges _ there is no law against trapping wildlife on citystreets, as long as it's done humanely.   Recently, however, the man has been spotted trapping pigeons inand around parks, including Riverside Park on Manhattan's upperWest Side. He lures them with bread crumbs, then claps his hands toscare them, and captures them as they fly into the air.   A neighborhood resident has posted a sign on a park fence,urging bystanders to ``call police if you see a man abductingsquirrels and pigeons.''   Park Department regulations make it a crime to ``molest, chase,wound, trap, hunt, shoot, throw missiles at, kill, remove or(possess)'' any bird from a city park.   William Kapps, director of enforcement for the SPCA, said thatseveral years ago two society agents trailed the pigeon pirate andhis captives to a poultry market in Newark.   But the agents, who carry guns, were spotted by Newark policeand asked to leave the jurisdiction.   Kapps said his agents would work with the Parks Department tomake sure the man was not poaching on public lands.   How appetizing are these urban birds? Not very, experts say.   Michael Lane, whose family has run a Manhattan poultry marketfor three generations, says pigeons served in good restaurants areraised on farms, where they live in cages and eat nothing butgrain. They never fly and develop relatively little muscle tissue.They are young, tender, and cost about $5 each.   But, ``a bird that's been living in the park tends to gettough,'' Lane said, ``and you don't know what they've been eating.I wouldn't eat one of 'em. A park pigeon has been around.''   He said that although people have been trying to sell capturedcity pigeons since his grandfather's time, no one had approachedhis poultry business with such an offer for two or three years.   Oscar Hartman, who runs a poultry distributor in the Bronx, saidthat occasionally teen-agers will trap pigeons on rooftops and tryto sell them ``when they need a few bucks.'' But he said he knew ofno one who systematically traffics in the birds, since there is nolegitimate market for them.</TEXT></DOC>
