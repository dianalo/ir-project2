In its annual review of &quot;U.S. trade barriers and unfairtrade practices,&quot; the EC listed more than 50 impediments totrade. Among the sectors singled out by Brussels were publicprocurement and banking.</LP><TEXT>   The EC report has been expanded considerably from lastyear and includes a wide range of trade practices runningfrom high U.S. tariffs on footwear to U.S. agriculturalexport subsidies. More than a dozen items have been addedsince the 1989 report, although commission officials saidonly some of these were actually new practices introduced inthe past year.   They said the longer list reflected the more thorough jobdone by EC experts in identifying U.S. trade barriers.   &quot;We detect a tendency in the U.S. to think that in thetrade game, other countries play unfair while only the U.S.plays fair . . . this simply isn't true,&quot; a commission tradeofficial said.   He said the EC report was a response to the U.S. traderepresentative's annual report on barriers to foreign trade,which repeatedly has included EC trade practices. U.S.officials had no immediate response to the EC document.</TEXT></DOC>
