The aircraft was on fire before it slammed into a mountainside onthe outskirts of this highland capital while preparing to land inheavy rain and an electrical storm Friday night, witnesses said.   All 11 on board were killed, including air force chief Gen. AngelAugusto Flores, two other members of Ecuador's air command, Gen.Raul Cousin and Gen. Galo Coronel, and Col. Shabtai Ben-Shua,Israel's military attache in Ecuador. The other dead included sixEcuadoran air force officers and one corporal.   Witnesses said the plane split apart after the crash and slid 200yards down a slope. Part of the wreckage slipped into theflood-swollen Machangara River, according to witnesses.   A spokesman for the air force's Air Accident Investigative Boardsaid investigators suspect the plane may have been struck by alightning bolt because the pilot of a plane following the militaryjet saw a flash just before the accident.   The plane was four miles from Quito's international airport whenit hit the mountain on the sparsely populated outskirts of thecapital. It had taken off from the Taura air force base on thePacific coast 160 miles southwest of Quito.   The air force did not provide official information on the exactmodel of the aircraft or its manufacturer.</TEXT></DOC>
