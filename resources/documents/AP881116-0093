Twisters killed six people in Arkansas and one in Missouri lateTuesday, and injured dozens more in those states and Illinois, Iowaand Kansas.   As the violent cold front churned eastward, midday temperaturesin parts of Kansas and Missouri were 30 to 40 degrees lowerWednesday than they had been the day before, and many areas got thefirst real snowfall of the season, the National Weather Service said.   At least three people were were reported dead in accidents onsnowy roads, and an Illinois woman was electrocuted after lightningdowned a power line in the northern city of Rockford. Cold, wind andsnow led to school closings in several states.   Ten inches of snow fell at International Falls, Minn., Wednesdaymorning, and the National Weather Service said there were hazardousconditions in much of Minnesota because of snow and blowing snow.   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the front, whichby midday extended across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into thecentral Gulf Coast. An inch of rain fell in less than two hours atFort Wayne, Ind.   Winds gusted to 50 mph or more in Traverse City and Lansing,Mich., and in Cleveland. High wind warnings or advisories wereposted in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.   In Chicago, city workers scrambled to repair downed trafficlights, clear fallen trees and open sewers clogged by heavy rains.   ``We're so busy here, hon, I can't even turn around twice,'' saidMary Church of the city's Streets and Sanitation Department. ``Wehave really been hit hard _ but we're handling it.''   The blustery winds combined with plunging temperatures to producewind-chill readings of zero to 20 below zero in northwestern Iowa,western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.   But the severest weather had taken place farther south on Tuesday.   ``I can't even tell what street I'm on because the trees areuprooted,'' said Police Chief Darnell Scott of the central Arkansastown of Lonoke. ``Damage is so bad. I think we were very lucky itwasn't more tragic than it was.''   Two people were killed near Lonoke, roughly 20 miles east ofLittle Rock, when a van overturned on Interstate 40. The othertornado victims in Arkansas were a young couple and their year-oldson whose mobile home was demolished in the nearby town of Scott,and a man who died when his home was destroyed in Van Buren County,north of Little Rock.   An elderly woman died in Butterfield, in southwestern Missouri,when a tornado threw her trailer home into the air, authorities said.   ``It may be a little unusual for this time of year to have atornado outbreak like this, because they normally occur in spring,''said meteorologist Brian Smith from the National Weather Service'sSevere Storms Center in Kansas City. But experts have said thattornadoes have been recorded in every month.   In Topeka, Kan., a tornado descended without warning, crashinginto Topeka West High School, but the injuries were described asminor.   ``Everyone's ears started popping and the teacher told us to getdown,'' said student Jennifer Stanley. ``All the windows startedpopping out.''</TEXT></DOC>
