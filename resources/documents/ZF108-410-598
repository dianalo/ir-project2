 If you're using an old personal computer with a10-or 20-megabyte hard disk, your data files and applications may bestretching the limits of your storage space--and your wits.andM;If you have an IBM PC AT or compatible computer, you can add a Plus HardcardII to complement your existing hard disk.andP;  Hardcard II, from Plus DevelopmentCorp., is a high-performance hard disk and controller mounted on a single,full-size expansion board.andP;  It costs about $400 more than a conventional harddisk of comparable storage size and performance ($849 for the 40-megabytePlus Hardcard II 40, $999 for the 80-megabyte Plus Hardcard II 80).andP;  But PlusDevelopment is betting that you'll pay more for Hardcard II's easyinstallation and proven reliability.andM;Should you pay the extra money?andP;  To answer the question, I tested Hardcard II80 against Seagate's Swift ST1100 ($650 to $700, depending on the reseller),a best-selling, high-performance, 80-megabyte conventional hard disk.andP;  Ifound that if your computer has an empty drive bay, a conventional hard disk,such as Swift, is usually a better buy.andP;  True, Hardcard II is faster andeasier to install than an unformatted, conventional hard disk.andP;  But it's easyenough to buy a conventional hard disk that's already formatted.andP;  Manydealers will install a hard disk in your computer for a nominal fee, or inyour company's computer as part of your corporate service contract.andP;  HardcardII offers a two-year warranty, which is twice as long as most other hard-diskwarranties.andP;  Only you can decide whether this additional coverage is worth$300.andM;Hardcard II is, however, the best or only solution to some special problems.andO;If you don't have a spare drive bay and want to keep your existing diskdrives, HardCard II is your only choice.andP;  It's also your best option if youalready have two hard drives and need to add a third--even if you have aspare third drive bay.andP;  And if your computer is already packed with expansionboards, Hardcard II could prolong your computer's lifetime.andP;  Its slim shapeand relatively low, 8-watt power requirement keep your computer runningcooler than it does with a conventional hard disk.andP;  That can mean less strainon your computer over the long term.andM;MECHANICSandM;You don't sacrifice any performance when you choose Hardcard II over aconventional hard disk.andP;  As the speed table illustrates, Hardcard II 80 andSwift are essentially equal performers.andP;  In my tests Hardcard II 80 ranapproximately 3% faster than Swift when performing several macro-driven FileXtract operations, but this difference is not significant.andM;Actually, Hardcard II 80's mechanical operation is lower than Swift's, butHardcard II 80 uses a disk cache to get data to your computer just asquickly.andP;  In my tests using the Coretest program, Hardcard II 80's averageaccess time was 26 milliseconds, compared to Swift's 20 milliseconds.andP;  ButHardcard II 80's 64K disk cache helps it transfer data to your programs at arate of 665 kilobytes per second, whereas Swift transfers data at a rate of489 kilobytes per second.andP;  The result is that the Hardcard, like Swift, hasan effective access time of 19 milliseconds.andP;  The memory for Hardcard II 80'scache is contained on the card itself, so you don't sacrifice RAM to get thisextra performance.andP;  (For more on disk performance, see the box.)andM;It's easy to put Hardcard II into your computer.andP;  You just remove yourcomputer's cover, plug the board into an empty 16-bit expansion slot, andreplace the cover.andP;  Hardcard II is preformatted, and its automatedinstallation software takes only a few minutes to run.andP;  When you havefinished, Hardcard II works exactly like a conventional hard disk.andM;But installation may be more difficult if your computer contains add-onequipment, such as a LAN board or a VGA display adapter.andP;  In this case you'llprobably have to adjust the switches on Hardcard II.andP;  The switches controlthe memory address and the interrupt level that Hardcard II uses to interactwith the computer.andP;  And Hardcard II's manual and the switch-setting chartimprinted on the card do little to explain these sophisticated concepts or toguide you in setting the switches.andP;  If you're not familiar with yourcomputer's inner workings, you'll probably have to call Plus Development'stechnical-support line for help.andM;Swift doesn't snap into your computer the way HardCard II does, but itdoesn't take that much longer to install--if your dealer formatted it.andP;  Youhave to insert the hard disk into a vacant drive bay and secure it withscrews, link the back of the hard disk to the disk controller, put the diskcontroller into an expansion slot, and connect the disk to the computer'spower supply.andM;If your dealer didn't format Swift, you have to do it yourself.andP;  That takestime.andP;  Most of that time is spent running a low-level format on the disk,which can take more than an hour.andP;  Next, you must run DOS's FDISK command topartition the disk, and then format it a second time with DOS's FORMATcommand.andP;  (See the box for more on formatting your hard disk.)andP;  AlthoughSwift includes a disk-management program that has prompts to guide youthrough this procedure, you're better off buying the disk from one of themany reputable dealers that sell it formatted.andM;SPECIAL CONCERNSandM;It's important to note that many hard-disk controllers can control two harddisks, but few controllers can tolerate a second controller in the samecomputer.andP;  That makes it nearly impossible to add a third conventional harddisk to your PC AT or compatible.andP;  But because Hardcard II's controller cancoexist with your conventional controller, it makes an ideal third hard disk.andM;Hardcard II is specially formatted to ensure that none of your data is everstored on a bad sector of the disk.andP;  The format includes a spare sector forevery four tracks on the disk (see the box for more on sectors and tracks).andO;If Hardcard II detects a bad sector while writing data to the disk, itautomatically writes the data to the spare sector instead.andP;  This eliminatesone way of losing data.andP;  To get the same protection for your conventionalhard disk, you need a utility program such as The Norton Utilities, PC Tools,or Mace Utilities.andM;Caroline Halliday is an electrical engineer with High Tech Aid, AChicago-area consulting firm specializing in technical documentation for thePC environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
