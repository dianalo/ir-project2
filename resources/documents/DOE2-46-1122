This key project is the first entiredecommissioning of a large, commercial-size nuclear power plant in theworld, and is being completed safely and cost effectively using existingdismantling practices. The Shippingport Decommissioning Project has consistedof two distinct phases: a surveillance, maintenance and operation phase,and a decommissioning phase. The former, also known as the caretakerphase, was completed by the end of 1984. Following a detailed operationalpreparatory review, decommissioning began during September 1985. Non-fuel-bearingirradiated core components were removed from the fuel-handling canaland placed into the reactor pressure vessel. The water level was thenlowered to allow the drainage of water from the reactor coolant systempipes and components. At the same time, the electrical system was shutdown, asbestos was removed, external surfaces were decontaminated, andthe systems were drained. During 1987, all reactor coolant system pipesand components were removed. Early in 1988, the reactor pressure vesseland neutron shield tank (RPV/NST) was shielded and prepared for one-pieceremoval. The removal of the fuel-handling canal and non-radioactive concreteand structures is now well advanced. At present there are no major technicalissues remaining. The project is expected to be completed with less than200 man-rem exposure which is one-fifth of the radiation exposure thanthe US Department of Energy has estimated for the decommissioning. 3figs.</TEXT></DOC>
