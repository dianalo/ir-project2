In an interview, Judy Ranzer, MCI's senior vice presidentof advertising, said Wells Rich will participate in thereview of the long-distance phone service company's accountalong with four other agencies, which she declined toidentify.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In the last three years, our advertising needs have grownenormously,&quot; Ms. Ranzer said. &quot;We thought it was time to takea deep breath and take stock of what was available to us fromagencies' strategic and creative thinking.&quot; The review isexpected to be completed by the end of November.   Despite those comments, Ms. Ranzer praised Wells Rich'screative work as &quot;truly excellent.&quot; People close to theaccount said MCI, although routinely enthused with the shop's&quot;strategic ideas,&quot; has been frustrated by what it sees asWells Rich's creative inconsistency. New York-based WellsRich created MCI's &quot;Let Us Show You&quot; campaign pitching itslong-distance services.   In addition, industry executives said MCI has beendismayed by the game of musical chairs among the senior staffon the account at Wells Rich. Initially, J. Dixon Byrne, anexecutive vice president, led the business. But after a year,he moved to another account, and Charles Evans took the reinsbriefly before being dismissed. Paula Kahn, an executive vicepresident who previously headed up Wells Rich's GardnerAdvertising unit, also had a brief stint as the account'sleader.   Another industry executive said the review may have beencalled in part because of some shifts in MCI's uppermanagement.   The review of the big account comes as MCI has slowly beenincreasing its share of the long-distance business. Accordingto Joel Gross, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, NewYork, MCI controls 16% of the U.S. long-distance market,making it a distant competitor to American Telephone andamp;Telegraph, which controls 68%. US Sprint controls about 10%of the market.   &quot;In this very competitive marketplace, you've got to findthe best weapons that you can get your hands on,&quot; Mr. Grosssaid. &quot;I think that ATandamp;T has been fairly effective recentlywith their `Put It in Writing' campaign to slow down theattack of the competitors. My guess is that MCI is lookingfor something to come back with.&quot;   Mr. Gross and other analysts said the ATandamp;T campaign, whichtakes direct shots at its smaller competitors and theirclaims of discount prices, has threatened to slow the growthof MCI's market share. ATandamp;T, of course, has a much biggeradvertising budget than MCI, spending about $550 million lastyear.   MCI, meanwhile, has continued with businesslike ads thatattempt to show the gentlemanly service MCI offers. Onerecent campaign, themed &quot;Big-business long distance for yourbusiness,&quot; pitched a service called MCI Vision for small andmedium-sized business customers. The ads used a funky cameratechnique to make it appear as though a pint-sizedbusinessmen is growing larger as he walks toward the camera.&quot;Why is MCI the only company that sees us as we really are?&quot;an announcer asks in one ad. &quot;Maybe they have a little betterperspective.&quot;   The ads are far different from early MCI spots, includingone that featured comedienne Joan Rivers spouting off aboutMCI as a feisty, young company with cheap rates. Analystssaid, though, that MCI has focused on small and medium-sizedbusinesses because competition has squeezed margins in theresidential and big-business segments.   It couldn't be determined which agencies would beconsidered for the account. But some executives speculatedthat Scali, McCabe, Sloves, a unit of WPP Group, and Levine,Huntley, Schmidt andamp; Beaver, two agencies that contended forthe account when it was reviewed in 1987, might be involved.Another industry executive said Grey Advertising might be onthe short list.   The loss of the MCI account would be a setback for WellsRich, which has made a number of staff changes in itscreative department in a bid to reignite its creativefirepower. Wells Rich's new-business record of late has beenhealthy, although it is also under the gun on the giant $60million Benson andamp; Hedges account from Philip Morris Cos. It isa finalist for a big new ad assignment from Chase ManhattanCorp.   One factor in Wells Rich's favor is a personal connection.Richard Hopple, the agency's president, has a closerelationship with Ms. Ranzer, the top advertising executiveat MCI. He previously was the senior account man on the MCIaccount when it was at D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles, anotherNew York agency.   Kenneth Olshan, chairman of Wells Rich, said yesterday hisagency will vigorously defend the MCI account. &quot;We've donegreat work for MCI and we welcome the challenge to presentourselves to management,&quot; he said.   ---   GM Cuts Commitments                                                                                                          General Motors is making fewer firm commitments to buyprint and TV advertising next year, Philip Guarascio, GM'sexecutive director for marketing programs and advertising,said in a speech yesterday before the Women's AdvertisingClub of New York.   The policy shift means those media deals GM does make&quot;will be bigger and run longer,&quot; Mr. Guarascio noted. Forinstance, he said, &quot;we will be reducing our firm magazinedeals by 25% to 30% for 1991.&quot; While GM may end up buying thesame number of magazine ad pages by year-end, he added, &quot;notas many will be locked into a schedule as we have had in thepast.&quot;   He said the auto giant wants greater advertisingflexibility because of the uncertain economic outlook -- eventhough GM's overall ad expenditures &quot;look relatively steady&quot;for 1991. The company spent about $1.29 billion onadvertising in 1988, according to a tally by Advertising Agemagazine.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
