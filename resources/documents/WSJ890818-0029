Stock traders took their cues from bonds and that market fell, too.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 13.66 points to 2679.63 in moderate trading. Long-term bond prices, which rallied briefly when the trade figures were reported, dropped more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount, during the course of the day, but recovered some of those losses to close off about half a point.    On the surface, the trade report looked encouraging. The nation's seasonally adjusted trade deficit narrowed to $8.17 billion in June, the lowest monthly deficit since December 1984. What's more, the May trade deficit was revised down to $10.02 billion from the $10.24 billion originally reported.    But on closer examination bond traders concluded that the export side of the equation was a trifle too strong. Exports in June rose 1.5% to a record $30.91 billion, implying that the economy in June was stronger than many investors had realized. That was just another piece in a continuing parade of evidence that has forced the bond market to adjust its portfolios to reflect a stronger than expected economy.    Yet some analysts contend that the bond market is overreacting to the evidence of economic strength, much as it overreacted earlier to indications that the economy was slumping toward a recession. James Solloway, an economist at Argus Research, said the 1.5% gain in exports wasn't as important as the 3.5% decline in imports. That view jibes with earlier-reported June economic data that showed an anemic economy, he said.    &quot;If this figure had been reported two or three weeks ago, we might be rallying on the import news instead of selling off on the export news,&quot; he said.    Now bond traders are awaiting the release this morning of the July consumer price index. It's expected to be up about 0.2%, continuing the moderating trend in inflation.    While improved economic growth would usually be good for stock prices, analysts said the bond market retreat weighed more heavily with investors.    In major market activity:    Stock prices slumped in moderate trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 157.6 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 887-561.    Bond prices were lower. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.15%. </TEXT></DOC>
