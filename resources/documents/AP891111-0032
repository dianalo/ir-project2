In Nicaragua, however, the two sides accused each other Fridayof launching more attacks in the 8-year-old war that has cost anestimated 12,000 lives.   A rebel radio broadcast said Nicaraguan troops ``continuebombarding the civilian population in Jinotega province'' innorthern Nicaragua but mentioned no casualties. It said thehelicopter attacks occurred Nov. 2.   The Defense Ministry said forces of the U.S.-backed Contrarebels this week attacked trucks carrying soldiers, killing twosoldiers and injuring seven. Most of the rebels are based inneighboring Honduras, but some are in Nicaragua.   Last week, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega canceled a19-month cease-fire, saying raids by the Contras were endangering acampaign for national elections Feb. 25. The Contras deny theystarted the fighting.   This week's talks at U.N. headquarters recessed late Friday.They will resume Monday in Washington at the headquarters of theOrganization of American States, said U.N. spokesman Juan CarlosBrandt.   The OAS and the United Nations are sponsoring the talks, thefirst between the two sides since June 1988.   Brandt said progress was being made on the Sandinista demandthat the Contras disband and on rebel proposals for an amnesty andtruce.   ``I think we were able to find some coincidence'' of views, saidthe chief Nicaraguan negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister VictorHugo Tinoco.   ``Next week in Washington we are going to continue thosediscussions, and we hope we will able to get a sound agreement thatwill incorporate the demobilization and the cease-fire,'' he toldreporters.   As the talks the two sides were discussing the toughest issue _whether the Contras will commit to a timetable for disbanding aspart of a package deal including a cease-fire and amnesty.   ``We are negotiating now our return to Nicaragua ... and we areready to go back once there is a meeting of minds between theSandinistas and our side,'' said Enrique Bermudez, the Contramilitary commander and chief negotiator.   A regional peace agreement signed by Central American presidentsin August at Tela, Honduras, requires that the Contras disband byDec. 5 and that Nicaragua hold free elections.   The Contras did not sign that pact. But Bermudez has notrejected the Dec. 5 deadline or the concept of demobilization,according to a source close to the talks.   ``We are negotiating; in that sense it is positive. It isnegative in the sense that we could not achieve a cease-fire. Thereis a war in Nicaragua,'' Bermudez said in public comments.   Diplomats said privately that the rebel delegation wanted toconfer over the weekend with a new Contra leadership commissionannounced this week.   A new element of uncertainty is whether Contra field commanderswould obey the new leaders and abide by a peace agreement.   This week, a new rebel ``civilian-military commission'' wasannounced, retaining only one of the former Contra directors,Aristedes Sanchez. Some former directors said they had been oustedin what they called a coup.   The leader of the new Contra commission, Israel Galeano, said ina letter to Vice President Dan Quayle that ``it would be foolish tovoluntarily hand over our weapons before free elections are held.''</TEXT></DOC>
