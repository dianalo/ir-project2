Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Next Inc., the second start-up company of Apple Computer Inc. co-founder Steven Jobs, is set to introduce its long-awaited computer on Oct. 12, when it may also disclose an alliance with International Business Machines Inc.    Next had been rumored to be on the verge of announcing its first computer for so long that Silicon Valley wags began calling the company Eventually Inc., but finally the fancy invitations are out.    &quot;Hoopla time is here,&quot; said a Next spokeswoman, who until now has been busy denying rumors and deflecting speculation about the date of the event. And if Apple product introductions staged during the Jobs years are any indication, the Next event will indeed be a spectacle. Next, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has rented San Francisco's posh Davies Symphony Hall for the occasion and is expecting a full house. &quot;We'll all be in body bags by the time it's all over,&quot; the spokeswoman said.    The unveiling of the computer, which Next said is designed for university students and educators, had been rumored since last spring. But the introduction was stalled as the company waited for software developers to put the finishing touches on a variety of programs for the machine, sources close to Next said.    Sources close to both companies say that IBM has agreed to license some software technology from Next, including the so-called graphical user interface that controls the on-screen appearance of the Next computer and makes it easier to use than some others. The sources said IBM would like to use the software on its RT family of technical workstations, a line that has been a sluggish seller so far in a market that itself is the fastest growing segment of the computer industry.    It is an ironic agreement, given Mr. Jobs historical disdain for IBM. During his days at Apple, Mr. Jobs helped create a free-spirited image for the company that was the antithesis of IBM's button-down, bureaucratic style. Nevertheless, an endorsement from IBM would bolster the credibility of the Next machine, which will compete with hot-selling technical workstations from Sun Microsystems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and others.    More importantly, the agreement would likely spur software developers to write more programs for the Next machine, knowing that some future some IBM machines might share the same graphical user interface, potentially representing a much larger market. Like most other technical workstations, the Next computer will use a variation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix operating system to control the basic operations of the machine.    Mr. Jobs founded Next in 1985 after abruptly leaving Apple, following a power struggle with Apple's chief executive officer, John Sculley. Apple sued Mr. Jobs for taking Apple trade secrets and several key Apple employees with him, but eventually settled after extracting the right to inspect the Next computer before it was introduced.    In early 1987, H. Ross Perot, the flamboyant founder of General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Inc. unit, invested $20 million in Next and holds a 16% stake in the company. Other investors include Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, and Stanford University, Palo Alto, which together contributed $1.3 million for a 1% stake. To date, Mr. Jobs has invested $12 million of his own money and holds a 63% stake. </TEXT></DOC>
