Negotiations are scheduled to resume at 3 p.m. EST here today with a mediator present, an American spokesman said.    The Association of Professional Flight Attendants currently is seeking authority from its 12,000 members to call a short-term strike during the Christmas holidays if it can't reach agreement on a new contract.    The Washington, D.C.-based National Mediation Board was involved in the contract talks in April but was unable to bring the two sides to an agreement. American, a unit of AMR Corp., then unilaterally imposed a new contract June 1.    American said, &quot;We think that mediation provides a positive prospect for a comprehensive agreement,&quot; adding that it would &quot;cooperate fully&quot; with the mediator. </TEXT></DOC>
