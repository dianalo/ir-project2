Pathological proof was obtained in 6 cases, including onecongenital splenic cyst, one splenic cavernous lymphangioma, two spleniccavernous hemangioma, one splenic hamartoma, and one splenic primarymalignant lymphoma. With the aid of ultrasonography, radiological computedtomography, and angiography, splenic cysts and splenic primary malignantlymphoma were able to make diagnosis. But splenic cavernous lymphangiomaand splenic cavernous hemangioma were unable to differentiate. Also splenichamartoma was unable to make diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
