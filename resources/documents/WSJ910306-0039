NTT said it chose Siecor Corp. of the U.S. -- a jointventure of Siemens AG and Corning Inc. -- and SumitomoElectric Industries Ltd. to work on developing ahigh-density, small-diameter cable, while Furukawa ElectricCo. and Fujikura Ltd. will develop connectors for low-loss,high-speed splicing.</LP><TEXT>   An NTT spokesman said the companies were chosen under thecompany's Track III procedure for development of newtechnologies.   The fiber-optic cable will be used to set up NTT'ssubscriber Optical Fiber network, the company said. Whilecurrent cables contain about 1,000 optical fibers, NTT wantsto develop a cable with about 4,000 optical fibers.   The project is part of NTT's goal of setting up afiber-to-the-home system to supplement and eventually replacethe current system of metallic cables, the spokesman said.
