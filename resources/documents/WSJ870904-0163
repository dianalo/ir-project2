As previously reported, the company said last month that it would dismiss the workers in November and transfer production of sheets to plants in Magog and Sherbrooke, Quebec. A spokesman said the company decided to delay the dismissals in part to give a group of employees and local business interests an opportunity to seek a buyer for the operation. </TEXT></DOC>
