Several national political pollsters said they expected Dukakiswould enjoy a surge in the polls coming out of the DemocraticNational Convention, and they said that would be in keeping withpast post-convention poll trends.   But these experts also said that because of this tendency forcandidates to get a public opinion lift from all of the exposure,Bush should be able to use the GOP extravaganza in New Orleans Aug.15-18 to help his standing.   While Bush could take some solace from such a boost, analystsnoted that history often has shown these post-convention spurts tobe short-lived.   For the moment, Dukakis has a commanding lead. He was ahead by17 percentage points in two polls last week, 18 points in twoothers. Survey results just before the July 18-22 convention hadranged from a dead heat to a slim Dukakis lead.   But what would have been a remarkable surge any other week wasroutine by post-convention standards. Conventions traditionallyboost the nominee by 10 or more points, mainly because of theintense positive exposure they provide.   ``The bounce Dukakis got seems to be pretty typical of whatwe've seen in the past three elections,'' said Larry Hugick,political poll chief for the Gallup Organization. ``It would beremarkable if he didn't get a bounce.''   ``The polls are accurate. The question is, are they predictiveof what will happen on election day,'' said Harrison Hickman, aDemocratic pollster. ``There is no question that the race willtighten up.''   If getting the bounce is easy, keeping it is not. Gallup pollsin recent elections showed convention surges settling as thecampaigns progressed and voters began paying more attention to theissues:   _Jimmy Carter went from a 17-percentage-point lead overPresident Ford before the 1976 Democratic convention to a 33-pointlead after it. But within a month his lead was down to 13 points,and he won in November by just 2.1 points.   _In 1980, Ronald Reagan went from a 3-point lead over Carterbefore the Republican convention to a 16-point lead after it. Amonth later it was a tie, though Reagan went on to win by 9.7percentage points.   _In 1984, Walter Mondale moved up from a 14-point deficit beforethe convention to a 2-point deficit just after it. But RonaldReagan soon made it back, and won the election by a landslide 18.2points.   With that history in mind, Dukakis pollster Irwin Harrison saidhe viewed the bounce more as an opportunity than an accomplishment.``The idea is to work as hard as you can to solidify what you gotfrom the convention,'' he said.   Conversely, the bounce puts pressure on the Bush campaign tocounterpunch effectively at the Republican National Convention thismonth.   If Bush cannot match Dukakis' post-convention poll bounce, ``itcertainly does not augur well for an election success,'' said LanceTarrance, a Republican pollster based in Houston.   ``If they don't bring enough back to cancel out that bounce fromthe Democrats, then they're digging themselves into a deeperhole,'' Tarrance said. ``They'll have to rely on a more negativecampaign,'' a risky fall strategy that could alienate voters.   The Republicans' task could be tough. Hickman, the Democraticpollster, said the nominee of the party in power often gains lessof a convention boost because he generally is well known and hasfewer voters to persuade.   Hickman also noted another historical pattern: In eight of thepast 10 presidential elections, the summertime leader went on towin.   ``You're better off, if you're the candidate who's made thefirst good impression,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
