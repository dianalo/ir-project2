He told a news conference in the Dominican Republic, whichshares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, that he hadtelephoned foreign leaders and international organizationsrequesting support.   Manigat said he believed the government Lt. Gen. Henri Namphyannounced Monday was fragile ``because the armed forces' cohesionbehind Gen. Namphy is artificial and temporary.''   The former political science professor added, however, that theend of his 4-month-old government meant the army had ``won apoint'' in the contest between military and civilian rule.   About his personal plans, he said:   ``I'm not going to fall into the classic trap of deposedpolitical men who see the return to power from one moment to theother and pass all their time waiting for that imminent return. I'mnot only a politician, but a political scientist. I can avoid thatvision, that force of mistaken politics and personal frustration.   ``I don't have any bitterness, nor personal rancor. I am sad formy country, for my people and for Haitian democracy.''   Manigat, 57, claimed widespread corruption in the military ledto the coup, which occurred after he took sides in what appeared tobe an internal military conflict.   He said he had tried to bring reforms to Haiti, but the militaryundercut him and democratic elements did not support hisgovernment. Opposition political leaders claim fraud in the Jan. 17election, which Manigat won with the army's help.   ``My government has been overthrown for specific reasons: theresistance and reaction of various powerful interests to my actionof struggle against the corruption and against smuggling'' in themilitary, he said.   ``My government represented the only and final chance fordemocracy. The other democratic sectors have understood that toolate and it was their political mistake to refuse the publicsupport that would have ... strengthened my government.''   The coup sprang from ``the unilateral initiative of Gen.Namphy,'' he said.   Namphy ``and his friends were openly criticizing theadministrative reform that I was developing to re-establishadministrative honesty and to clean up the public administrationand the public service sector,'' Manigat told reporters.   He said the general ``was irritated by seeing me revoke hiscorrupt friends placed in key positions of the publicadministration.'' He said those friends turned to Namphy for helpand eventually ``constituted a hostile climate, even a hostilenetwork, against my government.''   Security problems in the country were ``the work, in greatmeasure, of the sectors inside the armed forces themselves,''Manigat said.</TEXT></DOC>
