It's reallyremarkable,'' Rust said in an interview with The Associated Presson a Lufthansa flight from Moscow to Frankfurt.   The 20-year-old who stunned the world and embarrassed the RedArmy brass by piloting a single-enging plane from Finland throughthe vaunted Soviet air defenses and landing in Red Square said inthe future he would commit ``no crimes.''   He said he would wait to tell the world the whole story of his15 months in the nearly empty Lefortovo Prison, but he did say hefelt isolation and despair during his time behind bars, although hewas treated well.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan vetoed a $299.5 billionPentagon budget bill Wednesday, charging congressional Democratswith partisan politics and saying the bill would cripple his StarWars program and signal ``weakness and accommodation'' in U.S.defense policy.   Although the bill has become entangled in election-year politicsand leading Republicans had urged the president to veto it, Reagandisavowed any political motives.   ``These are issues of national security and they must remainabove partisan politics,'' he said.   ``The partisan politics is on the other side,'' he added.   The bill essentially would have authorized the spending levelsReagan sought, but sought to rearrange spending priorities.Administration officials complained that the legislation containedlanguage that would have tied the president's hands on future armscontrol negotiations with the Soviet Union.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Military investigators believe a U.S. Navycruiser attacked and destroyed an Iranian airliner July 3 becauseof human mistakes made under the stress of combat, defenseofficials said Wednesday.   Because of the mistakes, the captain of the USS Vincennesbelieved his ship had survived its first combat only to confront anapproaching, ``hostile'' Iranian jet fighter, said the sources, whoinsisted on anonymity.   In reality, the radar contact was a civilian airliner with 290people aboard that had just taken off from a large military base atBandar Abbas, Iran.   The classification of that radar contact as hostile appears tohave been made by crewmen in the heat of battle without adequatetechnical justification, said one official.   There is no evidence the cruiser's sophisticated Aegis radar airdefense system malfunctioned or that it presented technical data tojustify the ``hostile'' classification, the source added.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan quickly conceded after makinga joke about Michael Dukakis' health Wednesday that the remarkdidn't work as humor. But it did focus new attention on the issueof the presidential candidates' medical backgrounds.   Neither Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, nor Vice PresidentGeorge Bush, his Republican opponent, has released full, detailedrecords on his medical history during the 1988 campaign.   But both moved Wednesday to meet questions about their medicalpasts, and Dukakis issued a broad denial to rumors _ which had madetheir way into print _ that he had undergone psychiatric treatmentor suffered from depression.</TEXT><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ Senate leaders fought off a swarm of last-minutechanges proposed by corn growers and others Wednesday as theyhastened their rejuvenated bill to curb U.S. trade deficits towardPresident Reagan's desk.   ``If we are going to get this bill, and we need this bill, weare going to have to defeat some of the amendments that are goingto be offered very soon,'' Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore. told theSenate.   By wide margins the Senate then voted to table, or kill,proposed changes that would have curbed imports of Soviet fur,strengthened presidential control over trade retaliation machineryand barred the government from granting preferred trade status tothe Soviet Union.</TEXT><DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The city and three councilmen paid $1,600in contempt fines Wednesday, while the mayor warned that cityworkers could be laid off this month unless Yonkers complies with afederal housing desegregation order.   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand found the city and threecouncil members in contempt Tuesday for refusing to buildlow-income housing units. Yonkers' $100 fine will double daily andwould wipe out the city's $337 million budget in 22 days.   With a majority on the council opposed to the order _ andunmoved so far by their own $500-a-day fines _ the city hoped toget a quick stay of the contempt finding.   State officials, meanwhile, considered a plan to seize controlof the city's purse strings and remove members of the Yonkers CityCouncil.</TEXT><DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only the camels at the Ohio State Fair,one of the largest fairs in North America, weren't suffering fromthe heat and drought. Less exotic livestock had to be hosed down,and the vegetables hardly looked like prize-winners.   ``This is the worst display I have ever had,'' Tony Misich ofClinton, near Akron in northeast Ohio, said of his produce. ``I'vehad nothing but trouble this year.''   The effects of the nation's worst drought in more than 50 yearswere apparent as the Ohio State Fair prepared to open Thursday foran 18-day run, making it the longest-running fair in the nationthis year.   The temperature Wednesday, reaching 89 degrees by noon, was asteamy reminder of weeks of heat and too little rain, and theforecast for Thursday and possibly beyond was no better: 95-100degrees with high humidity.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Perhaps the summer's a bust when it gets too hotto swim in Lake Michigan. Welcome to the Heat Wave of '88, Chicagostyle.   ``We call it burnout. The people just get too much sun and theywant to run and hide,'' says Harry Gillespie, supervisor of thecity's 31 beaches. ``The sand is too hot and the lake's only 75degrees. The intense heat is driving people off the beach.''   Chicago has been fiery, sultry, stifling, stuffy, sweltering,torrid, tropical _ and all of the above. It's hard to find a``hot'' adjective that isn't getting overworked.   Through Wednesday, there were 35 days of temperatures at 90 orabove, and seven days at the century mark or higher, leaving in thedust the record of four 100-degree days in a single summer, set in1934, 1947 and 1953.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The temperatures are in the 90s, the humidity isbrutal, and the beaches are closed.

We're completelycleaned out,'' said Rawitz, a Manhattan air conditioner retailerfor the past 34 years, speaking from his air-conditioned office.``There's no question it's been good.''   Good for Rawitz; good and hot for almost everybody else. On 13occasions last month, the mercury climbed above 90 degrees; in anaverage New York July, the temperature breaks 90 just seven times.The forecast for the current week calls for temperatures to crack100.   The temperature climbed into the 90s again on Wednesday, whichmeant another day off for the horses which pull carriages inCentral Park. It was another day for tourists to sit in the sprayof a fountain outside the Exxon Building, and for Lester Rawitz tosmile inside the offices of Economy National Sales Inc.</TEXT><DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South African proposals for ending the Angolan warwere rejected Wednesday by Angola and Cuba, but the negotiators anda U.S. mediator agreed to continue talks aimed at reaching apeaceful settlement.

The research, conducted in Kenya, suggests that the prevalenceof some sexually transmitted diseases, the common use ofprostitutes and the lower frequency of circumcision may helpexplain why AIDS has spread widely through heterosexual contact inparts of central Africa.   While AIDS is transmitted mostly through homosexual encountersand illicit drug use in the United States and Europe, expertsbelieve it is largely a heterosexual disease in Africa, where up toa quarter of sexually active adults in some cities are infected.</TEXT><DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. and Canadian astronomers have found 10planet-like objects orbiting distant stars, a discovery thatintensifies speculation about the existence of life beyond theEarth.   In reports Wednesday at the International Astronomical Unionassembly, astronomers from the Smithsonian AstrophysicalObservatory in Cambridge, Mass., said they have found ``what mightbe a very large planet'' orbiting a star 90 light years away.   In an independent study, an astronomer from the University ofVictoria, British Columbia, said he has found evidence of planetsorbiting nine stars, and suggested that as many as half of thestars in the Milky Way galaxy may have ``planetary companions.''</TEXT><DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rural families who have been blessed with adaughter but really wanted a son will be allowed to try again undera new government policy that bows to the myths and economicrealities that have long made peasants prefer male children.
