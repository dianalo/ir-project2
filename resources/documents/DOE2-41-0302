Especially in an arms control environmentthat restricts nuclear materials, such misunderstandings, when combinedwith the already asymmetric nuclear materials capabilities of the USand the USSR, might place the US in an unexpectedly disadvantageous position.A simplified case will demonstrate that replacing warheads on a missilesystem, even with similar ones and even when the number of deployed deliveryvehicles remains constant, temporarily increases the weapons stockpileand the commitment of nuclear materials to the system. An applicationis made to an arms control case involving concurrent restraints on weapons,testing, and materials production. 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
