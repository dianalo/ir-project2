Poqet Computer Corp. introduced yesterday a 1-pound computer that can fit easily into a jacket pocket. The computer operates on regular batteries and uses the same DOS software that works on International Business Machines Co. personal computers.    &quot;This particular product will define a new category of computers, the full-featured pocket,&quot; said Tim Bajarin, executive vice president for Creative Strategies Research International, a research and consulting concern in Santa Clara.    Besides pushing into a new market, Poqet benefits from the backing of Fujitsu Ltd., the Japanese electronics giant. Fujitsu, Poqet's sole major investor with a 38% stake in the company, will market a Japanese-language version of the product next year. Fujitsu also supplies parts for the Poqet computer.    Poqet's computer is 8.8 inches long, 4.3 inches wide and 0.9 inch deep. But to make it that small, the company had to make concessions that could limit its usefulness, analysts say.    The computer, for instance, is relatively hard to type on; it uses a keyboard at least one-sixth smaller than conventional ones. To make room for a standard 25 lines, the screen displays shrunken characters. And while it runs popular word-processing and spread-sheet programs, these must be inserted into the computer on special memory cards.    &quot;The real question about Poqet is whether users are willing to sacrifice screen and keyboard quality for portability,&quot; said Bill Lempesis, an analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose.    Poqet plans to begin shipping the computer in the fourth quarter. It will sell for $1,995. At that price, it will compete directly with slightly larger &quot;notebook&quot; computers that offer larger data storage and better keyboards. &quot;Customers will either love it or hate it,&quot; Mr. Lempesis said. &quot;I expect them to make up their minds pretty quickly.&quot;    The computer does break new ground in some areas. While most portable computers require special batteries, Poqet's doesn't. Moreover, the machine consumes a mere 50 miliwatts when in use, enabling two AA alkaline batteries to power it for 100 hours.    John P. Fairbanks, Poqet's vice president of engineering, said the company relied on, among other things, innovative circuit design and the credit-card memory device to reduce power consumption. Poqet has filed 15 patent applications covering the machine, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
