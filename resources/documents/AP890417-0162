Force</HEAD><BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.N. spokesman said Monday that thefierce combat that broke out in northern Namibia at the outset ofthe independence process has created severe logistical problems forthe U.N. monitoring force.   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent thatis to oversee Namibia's transition to independence, said U.N.personnel had planned to use vacated South African militaryfacilities.   But because of clashes between security forces and guerrillas ofthe South-West Africa People's Organization, South African troopwithdrawal has been delayed, he said. This has created ``enormouscompetition'' for accommodation and other facilities in therelatively underdeveloped northern region of Ovambo.   Thornberry said the United Nations planned to start deployingpolice monitors in Ovambo this week who will check actions of theSouth African-led territorial police force. But he said it was hardto find offices for monitors that were easily accessible tocivilians who might want to file complaints.   The world body has urged civilians to report allegations ofharassment or intimidation by the security forces or SWAPOsupporters.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, SWAPO Foreign SecretaryTheo-Ben Gurirab said Monday that Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar should visit Namibia to restore public confidence in theUnited Nations.   Gurirab said a visit by the U.N. chief would help restore the``tarnished'' image of the United Nations in the eyes of Namibians.   He blamed the world organization for not stationing U.N.peacekeepers in northern Namibia by April 1, the day a cease-firewas supposed to take effect at the start of a yearlong transitionto independence but instead the day that SWAPO guerrillas foughtgun battles with South African-led security forces.   Territorial officials say 278 guerrillas and 27 security forcemembers have been killed and 28 guerrillas captured.   Thornberry said 2,662 members of the planned 4,650-member U.N.military force were in Namibia by Monday, with 410 Kenyaninfantrymen due by Tuesday.   South Africa said about 1,600 guerrillas crossed the border fromAngola in violation of an agreement that they stay at bases atleast 100 miles inside Angola. Up to 380 guerrillas returned toAngola after withdrawal orders from their exiled leader, and about900 remain in Namibia, South African offficials say.   As of Monday, only seven guerrillas reported to U.N. checkpointsestablished as part of a plan to give guerrillas safe passage backto Angola. The others who withdrew did so on their own.   Officials expressed doubt that guerrillas would venture near theassembly points because of the heavy concentration of police andsoldiers around each area.   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. In December,it agreed to allow independence in exchange for Cuba's withdrawingits estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.   SWAPO has fought South African rule since 1966 and is favored toget the most votes in pre-independence elections scheduled forNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
