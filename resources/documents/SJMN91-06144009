So when men gather for coffee at places like Hal'sGrubstake, talk soon turns to guns, not just long guns for hunting deer andducks, but pistols to carry concealed in the car or on the person.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHERIFF TRIGGERS CONTROVERSY OVER 1,350 CITIZENSWITH GUNS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     That a law-abiding resident is allowed to carry a concealed handgun is anarticle of faith not lightly tampered with in these parts. When the newlyelected sheriff questioned the deeply held belief that people here need tocarry guns for self-protection, he set off what may become his own recall fromoffice.;    &quot;There is a misperception that I was branding people as somethingless than good citizens,&quot; said Art Brandwood, a career police officer whobecame sheriff in January and has been much stricter on issuing permits.;   &quot;I simply wanted to ensure that people have a legitimate need and haveadequate training in weapons safety and know how and when to use a gunappropriately.&quot;;    But many here are beyond convincing. &quot;We are not walkingaround the shopping malls with .44 Magnums under each arm,&quot; said Tom Montana,who has had a permit and a pistol for 20 years. &quot;It's an insurance policy.With a gun, you are not alone.&quot;;    State law requires residents to obtain apermit to carry a pistol hidden from view. Brandwood's predecessor was liberalin approving them. Three and a half times as many permits, 1,350, are ineffect here in Sutter County with fewer than 65,000 residents as in LosAngeles County with 8.8 million residents.;    More relevant, the number istwice that of the neighboring counties of Yolo, with double the population,and Yuba, which is about the same size.;    The unusually high number struckBrandwood after he attended a seminar for new sheriffs where he learned about&quot;vicarious liability,&quot; the principle that counties can be liable if a permitholder commits a crime or injures someone through misuse of a concealedpistol.;    No county has ever been sued on this ground, but Brandwood was notabout to take chances. With Sutter County, like other rural counties inCalifornia, in such a fiscal crisis that some schoolchildren attend classes ina tent, he said just one lawsuit could financially sink it.;    All of which,some citizens here say, amounts to wild speculation. &quot;They can't even cite onesingle case,&quot; said Dave Alan Bradley, a leader in the recall effort who hashad a permit for a dozen years.;    &quot;I don't see how they can take away myprivilege without having a good reason. This is a direct assault against 1,350people who are the most law-abiding citizens in the community.&quot;;    Thesecitizens have obtained the permits upon presenting proof &quot;that good causeexists&quot; for carrying a concealed weapon, as required by state law. The 58county sheriffs decide what is &quot;good cause.&quot;;    And as permit holders learnedupon trying to renew their annual permits, what used to be &quot;good cause&quot; nolonger qualified -- like concern about carrying large sums of cash as part oftheir jobs, or the terror that Darlene Jean felt upon being accosted whilefishing by herself along the Feather River, often is not anymore,;    By thetime angry citizens stormed the board of supervisors meeting in April tocomplain, Bradley had already obtained petitions to gather signatures -- hewill need 5,837 -- to place the recall measure on the November ballot.;    Thesheriff has since promised to reconsider all renewals that had been denied,and he notes that he was one of only two sheriff candidates who won theNational Rifle Association's endorsement last November.;    But the recalldrive has gone ahead full steam, and the sheriff, admitting to being apolitical novice, has hired a media consultant.;    &quot;He's a career cop,&quot; saidthe consultant, Paul Kranhold, of Sacramento. &quot;This is the first time he'sdelved into politics. We came to the realization that Sutter County is notlike Los Angeles or San Francisco. The demographics are different.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Yuba City  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910523  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  732  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 23, 199100144009,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
