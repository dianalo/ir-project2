The measure, adopted late Thursday 343-126 with 17 abstentions, comes as the Brazilian government pursues conciliation with foreign creditor banks and the International Monetary Fund. The vote gives foreign mining companies five years to either cede control of their operations to Brazilians or leave the country. It was accompanied by another vote excluding foreign companies from winning oil-exploration contracts in the future. Their current operations aren't affected.    Barring a last-minute reversal, the measures will be written into the new constitution at a time when the official stance of President Jose Sarney and Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega has been that Brazil's import-substitution model is no longer effective, its need for foreign investment overwhelming and its goal a more open and competitive economy.    Antonio Castro, finance director of Alcoa Aluminio S.A., the Brazilian unit of Pittsburgh-based Aluminum Co. of America, called the vote &quot;incompetent nationalism born of ignorance.&quot; Certainly, it emerged from the same unlikely alliance of industrial interests and the left, united under the banner of nationalism, that adopted the country's controversial ban on foreign microcomputer manufacturers. It showed again that the country's long-term goal of becoming a great power is entangled in a jumble of nationalist rhetoric that is likely to leave foreign companies -- as well as any IMF accord -- vulnerable for the foreseeable future.    Mining has long been a politically sensitive sector in Brazil. The country has attracted particular foreign interest in light of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa and divestiture by many companies of operations there. Brazil has large reserves of bauxite, nickel, copper, cobalt, iron ore, gold and a host of rare metals. Foreign companies account for about 20% of the estimated annual production of about $3 billion. According to the National Department of Mineral Production, 32% of the largest mining companies are foreign, with total investments approaching $2 billion.    Officials from multinationals expressed disappointment and apprehension. Claudio Galeazzi, a senior officer at British Petroleum Mineracao S.A., a unit of British Petroleum Co., told the Gazeta Mercantil business newspaper that the company was considering canceling a $200 million investment planned this year. Inco Ltd. has a gold property in Brazil that is scheduled to begin production soon; Inco officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Several analysts suggested that Brazilian companies will be hard-pressed to find the capital to take over foreign interests, making state intervention likely at a time when Messrs. Sarney and Nobrega say they want to trim a bloated and indebted state sector.    The decision won't please the IMF or Brazil's government and bank creditors, which have been prodding the country to shun protectionism and trim state involvement in the economy. As a matter of policy, the IMF doesn't comment on the policies of member countries that affect specific industrial sectors. Mr. Castro of Alcoa said he had received several calls from concerned U.S. bankers. Brazil is close to signing an accord with foreign banks, which should end a moratorium that began more than a year ago on $67 billion of Brazil's foreign bank debt. Any agreement will be linked to an IMF accord.    Messrs. Sarney and Nobrega declined to comment. But the vote was a clear embarrassment to Mr. Sarney, showing that his government lacks any steady support in the assembly. His Brazilian Democratic Movement Party has lost the ability to govern because it has become splintered into a host of factions tied to lobbies.    This disarray is almost certain to last beyond the adoption of the constitution until a direct presidential election is held, likely at the end of next year. Even then, stability may be tenuous. Confronted by the mining measure, the country's last military ruler, Gen. Ernesto Geisel, said, &quot;I think the new constitution will have a short life.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
