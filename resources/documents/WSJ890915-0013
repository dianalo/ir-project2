Based on yesterday's closing stock price of $48.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the new ESOP would be able to purchase about 2.5 million Kerr-McGee shares, equal to about 5% of the 48.3 million shares outstanding.    It wasn't clear whether the move is intended as a defensive measure. The company has long been rumored as an attractive takeover candidate.    But the new ESOP won't hold an unusually large number of shares. According to Kerr-McGee's May proxy statement, officers and directors own only 4.4% of the company, so the combined ownership of management and the ESOP still would be less than 10%.    Kerr-McGee couldn't be reached for comment on the plan, which was disclosed late yesterday.    The company said that beginning Jan. 1, it would match employee contributions to the ESOP instead of to the Savings Investment Plan. </TEXT></DOC>
