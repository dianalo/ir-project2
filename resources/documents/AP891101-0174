Krenz said he and Gorbachev reached ``total agreement on allquestions we discussed,'' one of which was reform in the SovietUnion and East Germany.   Many of the hundreds of thousands marching for democracy in EastGermany were showing support for ``the renovation of socialism,''he said.   ``In this sense, I consider this a very good sign,'' Krenz tolda news conference after meeting with Gorbachev on his first tripabroad since replacing hard-liner Erich Honecker, his 77-year-oldmentor, two weeks ago.   The remarks about protest were his most tolerant to date.Krenz's government has embarked on dialogue with the opposition andmore open dealings, trying to gain the people's trust after decadesof repression.   Honecker, who led the country for 18 years, was brought down bythe flight of tens of thousands of East Germans, most of themskilled young workers, and weeks of mass demonstrations.   Flight and protest continued on Wednesday.   More than 500 East Germans showed up at the West German Embassyin Prague, Czechoslovakia, seeking passage to the West.   ADN, the official East German news agency, said 8,000 EastGermans had crossed the Czechoslovak border under the new policy ofvisa-free travel to the neighboring Soviet bloc ally. Thousands ofEast Germans already have fled to West Germany throughCzechoslovakia.   The agency said 20,000 people marched in Neubrandenburg onWednesday eveningand tens of thousands filled the streets ofFrankfurt an der Oder.   More signs of change emerged at home while Krenz was in Moscow.   Officials in East Berlin acknowledged serious problems in theplanned economy and indicated sweeping reforms may be in store torestructure industry and improve production. Quality consumer goodsare rare in East Germany and many people wait 10 years for a car.   Wolfgang Vogel, a prominent government lawyer, was quoted by theWest German newspaper Die Welt as saying political prisoners werebeing released and ``We hope there will be no new convictions basedon political grounds.''   Manfred Gerlach, chairman of the Free Democratic Party and anally of the Communists, said the government needs overhauling, theCabinet should be streamlined and his party should have a greaterrole.   On a visit to West Germany, a city Communist Party chief evenquestioned the Berlin Wall, the symbol of East German repressionbuilt in 1961. Johannes Chemnitzer of Neubrandenburg said theopening of borders by other Soviet bloc countries made the wall'ssignificance ``limited and illusory.''   Krenz expressed the opposite view in Moscow, however, declaringthat the wall ``is not a border between two states ... it's aborder between two social systems, a border between two militaryblocs, and this is a border in the vicinity of which are a greatconcentration of weapons.''   He told the journalists he and Gorbachev discussed Sovietreforms, and their possible applications in East Germany, in ``anatmosphere which exists only between true friends.''   His government's aim, he said, is to ``further strengthensocialism in our country and start reform in all aspects of oursociety.''   Gorbachev said on East German televisions there were``differences and similarities'' in the reform processes of EastGermany and the Soviet Union, and each must set its own course.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev assuredKrenz of Soviet support in the face of ``great changes'' andexpressed confidence the East German party, ``having richtraditions, can overcome the difficulties that arise and, with thesupport of the people, can lead the process of renewal.''   Krenz would not go into detail about reforms planned in EastGermany, but denied reports that he took issue with some aspects ofGorbachev's program, called perestroika.   ``We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process ofperestroika in the Soviet Union,'' he said, adding that heespecially wanted to explore its aim of giving communist moreappeal for the average citizen.   ``If we resolve the problems of making socialism moreattractive, I'm sure people will stay in our country, '' he said.   He promised ``to create expansive opportunities for each citizenof East Germany to obtain a visa and passport to go to any countryin the world,'' and said proposals would be discussed by thegovernment, public and parliament.   As East German leaders have before him, Krenz rejected the ideaof reunification with West Germany.   The separate nations are ``an integral part of the stability ofEurope,'' he told the news conference, and quoted a Frenchman,unidentified, as saying: ``I love Germany so much I'm glad thereare two of them.''</TEXT></DOC>
