Thus, the effective rate of assessmenton members doing business in government securities will be .125%. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The NASD originally submitted the terms of the proposedrule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act. <T3>See</T3> File No. SR-NASD-88-41, Securities Exchange Act Release No.26118 (October 6, 1988), 53 FR 39392.

The Commission received two comment letters objecting to the proposed rulechange, response letters from the NASD,\5\<NOTE/> and follow-up letters from the adverse commentators.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See</T3> letters from Frank J. Wilson, Executive Vice President andGeneral Counsel, NASD to Brandon Becker, Associate Director, Division ofMarket Regulation (``Division''), SEC dated March 7, and to Richard G.Ketchum, Director, Division, SEC, dated June 27, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> letters from Lawrence I. Fox, Counsel, Government SecuritiesBrokers Association (``Association'') to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC,dated February 14, and July 25, 1989; and letters from Aubrey G. Lanstonandamp; Co., Inc., <T3>et al.</T3> (``Lanston'') to Jonathan G. Katz, dated February 15, andJuly 19, 1989. Although the commentators recognized the need to establish and impose appropriatefees to defray the costs of implementing the GSA requirements for examinationof government securities broker/dealers (``GSBDs'') who engage only ingovernment securities activities,\7\<NOTE/> they objected to the method of determining the assessmentand the amount of the assessment.\8\<NOTE/> Specifically, the commentators assert that the fee is disproportionatelyhigh. They argue that the .125% assessment, itself, would generate morerevenue than necessary to cover the cost of discharging the NASD's additionalresponsibilities under the GSA.\9\<NOTE/> In addition, they assert that the nature of the governmentsecurities market \10\<NOTE/> and the limited regulatory scheme applicable to that marketmake it easier for the NASD to regulate them and hence, less costly. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Integrated firms (<T3>i.e.</T3>, firms doing a general securities business as well as a governmentsecurities business) are presently subject to a .125% assessment (<T3>i.e.</T3>, .25% with a 50% credit) on gross income, which includesincome realized from transactions in U.S. Government securities. <T3>See</T3> NASD By-Laws, Schedule A, section 1(b)(ii) and section 5,<T3>NASD Manual</T3>, paragraphs 1752 and 1756. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The commentators also assert that the NASD has not providedsufficient documentation of the assessment to enable the commentators ameaningful opportunity to comment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The commentators argue that the 50% credit for fiscalyear 1988 demonstrates in and of itself that the assessment is too high.The Commission, however, believes that the assessment should be evaluatedin conjunction with the 50% credit which results in the effective assessmentrate of .125% <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The Association further asserts that, because its members'activities are even more limited (brokers do not take positions in securities,they do not make markets, and they deal only with approximately 60 accounts,all of which are NASD members), they should be subject to a lower assessment.With regard to the nature of the government securities market, the commentatorsnote that the market is essentially a wholesale market dominated by institutionalinvestors, with a large amount of income derived from a small number oftransactions; as opposed to the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market thatis essentially a retail market with a larger number of transactions thatrepresent a smaller dollar amount. The commentators infer from the respectivenatures of these markets that the government securities market is inherentlyless subject to abuse and hence, easier to regulate. They also assert thatthe regulatory regime applicable to government securities imposed by theGSA is less comprehensive, thus the expenditures for examination of recordspertaining to the same should be less than those for OTC or municipal securities.Furthermore, they assert that the NASD's estimates understate the likelyrevenues that will be generated from a .125% assessment on the gross incomederived from transactions in U.S. Government securities. Consequently,the commentators argue that the proposal is not an equitable allocationof reasonable dues, fees, and other charges pursuant to section 15A(b)(5)of the Act.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-3 (1982).The NASD repsonse letters provide additional information regarding theassessment.\1\\2\<NOTE/> With respect to the argument that the fee is too high, theNASD states, and the adverse commentators do not dispute, that the .125%assessment will not cover its actual cost of regulation of GSBDs for fiscalyear (``FY'') 1989.\1\\3\<NOTE/> The NASD asserts that its cost of regulating GSBDs was approximately$2.4 million for FY 1988 and that it has not experienced a significantdrop to date in the resources necessary to oversee the activities of theGSBDs. Because the FY 1989 assessment rate was based upon the NASD's initialcost projections for FY 1988, and not the higher actual costs,\1\\4\<NOTE/> the NASD anticipates the proposed assessment will generateapproximately $1.5 million, resulting in a shortfall of almost $1 millionfor FY 1989.\1\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ Specifically, the NASD stated that even if the costestimates did not include the cost to support certain departments and activitiesof the NASD unrelated to the regulation of GSBDs, namely qualificationsexaminations, the Corporate Financing Department, the Uniform PracticeDepartment, the Arbitration Department, and 99% of the Advertising Department,the assessment derived would remain unchanged. Concomitantly, the Commissionconcurs with the position held by a commentator that had the NASD chosennot to include in the assessment the cost of supporting certain activitiesunrelated to GSBD regulation, any future losses incurred by the NASD fromthese non-government securities activites should then be charged againstthe over-the-counter assessment (and the related credit) and not againstthe government securities assessment (and related credit). <T3>See</T3> letter from Giovanni P. Prezioso, counsel, Lanston, to RichardG. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated August29, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ At the time of the original filing the NASD had estimatedthe cost of regulation for FY 1989 at $1.7 million. This estimate was basedon projected costs for FY 1988. Since the time of the original filing,the NASD has calculated the actual costs, which indicate that the NASDunderestimated the expense of regulating the GSBDs during FY 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The NASD states that it will not recover the $2.4 millionincurred in FY 1988 for regulating GSBDs or the development costs for thenew regulatory enterprise. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ The current assessment does not preclude the NASD fromsubsequent revisions of the fee. The NASD will continue to evaluate thefairness of the assessment, and adjust it appropriately as the NASD developsadditional information and experience vis-a-vis GDBD oversight. <T3>See</T3> letter from Frank J. Wilson, Executive Vice President andGeneral Counsel, NASD to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Market Regulation,SEC, dated August 29, 1989.Furthermore, regarding the assertion of the Association that the natureof the market is such that the NASD's regulatory responsibilities are lessburdensome, the NASD asserts that regulation of the GSBDs has uncoveredproblems that are not materially different from the problems experiencedwith other member firms.\16\<NOTE/> The NASD also notes that the involvement of other regulatoryauthorities such as the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of theTreasury makes responding to problems experienced by GSBDs more complex.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Specifically, with respect to government securities brokers(interdealer brokers), the NASD notes that three such firms lost theirspecial status, <T3>e.g.</T3>, the NASD found that RMJ Securities Corporation conducteda business in registered Collateralized Mortgage Obligations outside ofthe scope of its section 15C registration (dealing in non-government securities).Other GSBDs had been conducting a business in corporate and municipal bonds.<T3>See </T3>letter from Frank J. Wilson, dated June 27, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Under the terms of the GSA, regulatory responsibilityfor government securities firms is shared by the SEC and the Departmentof the Treasury. The Federal Reserve Board must be consulted regardingthe promulgation of rules.The commentators submitted follow-up letters that reiterate the concernsstated in their earlier letters and dispute the method used by the NASDto allocate nonassessment revenue streams.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ In addition, the commentators contend that the supplementalcorrespondence submitted by the NASD should be published for comment inthe same manner as the original filing. They assert that the requirementsof section 19(b)(1) are analogous to those imposed by the AdministrativeProcedure Act (``APA''), 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) (1982) and relying upon <T3>United Church Bd for World Ministries </T3>v. <T3>S.E.C.</T3>, (``United'') 617 F. Supp. 837 (D.D.C. 1985), assert thatthe supplemental correspondence submitted by the NASD contains significantnew data and theories, and, therefore should be published for comment.The Commission, however, believes the Release provided the notice requiredby section 19(b)(1) of the terms and substance of the proposed rule change.The legislative history of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 statesthat the standards for publication under section 19(b) are intended tobe the same as those in section 553 of the APA with regard to agency rulemaking.Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, <T3>Securities Act Amendments of 1975</T3>, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Congress,1st Session 129 (1975). The APA requires and ``exchange of views, information,and criticism between interested persons and the Agency.'' <T3>Home Box Office, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission</T3>, 567 F.2d 9, 35 (D.C. Cir.),<T3>cert. denied</T3>, 434 U.S. 829 (1977). The objective of the APA noticehas been interpreted to serve three basic requirements. First, the notice-and-commentperiod improves the quality of agency rulemaking by testing proposed rulesthrough exposure to public comments. Second, the notice requirement providesan opportunity to be heard, which is fundamental to basic fairness. Third,notice and comments allow affected parties to develop a record of objectionfor judicial review. <T3>United </T3>at 839. The Commission believes that these requirementshave been met. The letters submitted by the NASD responded to the commentators'letters concerning the internal allocation of NASD revenue. They do not,however, alter the terms or rationale of the proposed rule change. Furthermore,the commentators received actual notice of the NASD letters and did commenton them. The comment process, including the responses to comments fromthe NASD and the subsequent letters from commentators, is evidence thatthe necessary exchange of views has occurred. <T3>See </T3>File No. SR-NASD-88-55.The Commission has reviewed the NASD's proposal as well as the argumentsraised by the adverse commentators, and has concluded that the proposalis consistent with the Act. The proposed rule as submitted by the NASDis cognizant of the regulatory regime imposed on members transacting businessin U.S. Government securities. The assessment levied by the NASD reflectsthe scope of the activities that the NASD monitors vis-a-vis transactionsin U.S. Government securities, and is identical to the fee imposed on thegovernment securities revenue of broker/dealers who do not conduct theirgovernment securities activities through a separate subsidiary. Furthermore, the FY 1988 costs to the NASD for GSBD activities actuallywere greater than the NASD's original projections, and having based theFY 1989 assessment upon the FY 1988 projection, a shortfall for FY 1989is anticipated. Moreover, the NASD has committed to review during FY 1990the costs entailed in its government securities examination program todetermine whether the present level of the fee remains appropriate. Nordoes the Commission find that the NASD's use of an end of year credit isinconsistent with the Act. The Commission notes that the NASD employs endof year credits for all its revenue based fees. The NASD has employed thismethodology because of the substantial variability of securities industryrevenue. Moreover, the fact that the NASD annually reconsiders the assessmentcredit mitigates against any potential for the NASD to accumulate excessivesurplus revenues. The NASD consistently has provided for rebates of theannual assessment. Such rebates must be submitted pursuant to section 19(b),thus providing opportunity for notice and comment. The percentage of therebate has varied from 20% to 52.5% during the past six years.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 20306 (October 19, 1983),48 FR 49568; 21293 (September 6, 1984), 49 FR 36041; 22407 (September 13,1985), 50 FR 38238; 23516 (August 7, 1986), 51 FR 29175; 24745 (August20, 1987), 52 FR 31459; 26118 (September 26, 1988), 53 FR 39392. The firsttime a discount was available to member firms was in 1966 (43%); therewere no discounts during the years 1967 through fiscal year 1983.Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act requires that the rules of the NASD providefor the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other chargesamong members. The Commission believes that the basis for the proposedassessment adheres to the standard in section 15A(b) (5).The actual cost to the NASD for regulating GSBD activities during FY 1988was greater than the NASD's original estimation, and higher actual regulatorycosts for FY 1989 are anticipated. The fact that the NASD, under the proposedassessment, expects to collect less than the actual cost of regulatingGSBD activities during FY 1989 is alone a strong indication that the assessmentis reasonable. Moreover, the Commission does not agree with the commentators'assertion that the fees imposed on GSBDs are inequitable vis-a-vis othercategories of member firms because they recover a greater percentage ofthe NASD's costs than do the fees imposed on other NASD members. The commentatorsreach this conclusion based on a simplistic analysis in which they havesegregated costs of several programs not relevant to the regulation ofgovernment securities dealers. Yet in reaching this conclusion, the commentatorsignore the fact that revenues obtained from NASDAQ terminal charges andissuer revenue charges are in no way attributable to government securitiesactivities. We agree with the conclusion of the NASD that in analyzingthe fairness of the proposed fee it would be reasonable to segregate outboth the costs and revenues attributable to government securities dealers.\2\\0\<NOTE/> When analyzed in this light, the proposed fee will actuallyreimburse the NASD for a smaller percentage of its regulatory costs resultingfrom the oversight of GSBDs than from fees obtained from its other members.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ Members who transact business in municipal securitiespay a pre-credit amount equal to .21% of annual gross income from suchtransactions. The NASD has indicated that this slightly lower rate is imposedon municipal securities broker/dealers because they are the only NASD memberswho are required to pay assessments to the Municipal Securities RulemakingBoard (``MSRB'') as well as the NASD. <T3>See</T3> letter from Frank J. Wilson, dated August 29, 1989. <T3>See also</T3> andSection; 15B(b) (2) (J) of the Act, and <T3>MSRB Manual,</T3> Rules A-12, A-13, A-14.

Wilson, dated June 27, 1989, page 4 andExhibit 4.The Commission believes that this allocation of costs reflects an equitableimposition of fees as well as assurance that the NASD is not, in contraventionof section 15A(b) (9) of the Act, imposing any burden on competition notnecessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A and therules and regulations pursuant to the same. <T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> pursuant to section 19(b) (2) of theAct,\2\\2\<NOTE/> that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
