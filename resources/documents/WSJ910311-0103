Less than a year ago, a group of local banks and Hong Kongbrokerage firms agreed to serve as founding members of thebourse, where listing regulations were to be more relaxedthan those in neighboring Hong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   An international consulting group predicted vibranttrading within several years in shares of more than 100companies, both local and foreign. Macau business dynamoStanley Ho's enthusiasm for the project suggested awillingness to list his Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes deMacau SARL (STDM) on the bourse. STDM dominates most localbusiness and its banking unit, Banco Seng Hang, is leadingthe push for the exchange.   Hopes that trading could begin this year were dashed lastSeptember, when the governor resigned amid a bribery scandalbefore deciding on the matter. Some believe the delay mayhave dealt a critical blow to the delicate timing of theopening of the exchange, which they are counting on to helpdevelop Macau as a service center for China's Pearl Riverbasin.   &quot;The project has come to a complete standstill,&quot; saysEduardo J.G. Ribeiro, a close associate of Mr. Ho anddirector of Banco Seng Hang.   Its fate now rests with Governor Carlos Melancia'ssuccessor, who is to be named later this month by PortuguesePresident Mario Soares. Even if the new governor makes adecision by July, however, a year would likely pass beforethe relevant laws and equipment could be put in place toallow stock trading. But by then, it may be too late.   An hour's hydrofoil ride to the east, Hong Kong is talkingabout establishing a second board for companies too tiny toqualify for current listing. The move threatens to drain offfledgling concerns that Macau hopes to lure.   To the north, Beijing is pursuing plans to replicate thetrading at its recently opened Shanghai stock exchangeelsewhere in the south. Such plans could siphon off potentialfloatations by joint ventures operating in the Zhuhai specialeconomic zone bordering Macau.   The listing of such outside companies is deemed criticalif the Macau exchange is to succeed. Trading restricted tothe several dozen local banks, utilities and industrialconcerns suited to go public wouldn't generate enoughinterest to be worthwhile, says Martin Adams, a director atLloyds Bank Fund Management Ltd. who maintains extensivecontacts with Macau.   Projections also show that if the market were strippeddown only to Macau companies, some 80% of its capitalizationwould be accounted for by STDM. Such domination would makethe project untenable, Mr. Ribeiro and outside observers say.   &quot;We have very, very dark doubts about whether {such} amarket could exist because of its limited size,&quot; says AlbertoSoares, senior deputy general manager of the Macau office ofBanco Nacional Ultramarino S.A., which issues the colony'sbanknotes.   Perhaps the most crucial element in the timing of theproject, though, relates to the approach of 1999, when Macauwill shift to Chinese hands. Looking at Hong Kong'sexperience with increasing influence from Beijing in therunup to its own transfer in 1997, Mr. Ribeiro believes planshave to proceed quickly: &quot;Our window of opportunity willclose by the end of 1992.&quot;   While Mr. Ribeiro stresses haste, other leaders cautionthat the move could backfire if it doesn't proceed gingerly.&quot;This is a small economy, everything in it is linked,&quot; saysJorge Pereira, general manager of Companhia de InvestimentosSARL, one of the largest Portuguese companies in Macau. &quot;Ifwe fail with the exchange, things can be devastated.&quot;   He says it could take several years before adequateauditing, securities and company laws are put on the books,though Mr. Ribeiro believes proper legislation could beinstituted within 10 months. &quot;We'd first have to make surethis stock market isn't just another gambling opportunity,&quot;Mr. Pereira says.   Few deny that a stock market could play an important rolein helping Macau companies modernize at a time when a numberof major infrastructure improvements are under way. Potentialfor the project also is recognized in Hong Kong. Edward Chan,who keeps tabs on Macau businesses at ChinTung ResearchInternational Ltd., said an exchange would draw healthyinterest from Hong Kong investors eager to tap into thePortuguese colony's potential as a gateway into China.   A consultant at an international firm who's familiar withthe project says the exchange, if handled properly, couldserve Asia's mounting need for a market offering suchinstruments as options, closed-end mutual funds and bonds. Italso could serve as an over-the-counter market for smallcompanies from around the region.   None of the existing exchanges in Southeast Asia arepositioned to serve the purpose, he argues. Singapore's isburdened by too much red tape. Exchanges in Kuala Lumpur andBangkok lack the infrastructure. And Hong Kong, despite plansfor a second board, is too preoccuppied with maintaininginternational standards.   Mr. Ribeiro is chary, however, of expanding the range oftraded products too quickly. And others in Macau are equallyambivalent about trying to offer a wide range of productsthat could threaten the fragile financial community withoutbenefiting anyone in the colony except a few banks. Even thepossibility of listing too many foreign companies raises theeyebrows of some, who fret the exchange could become what Mr.Pereira calls a &quot;garbage can&quot; for companies throughout theregion that are unwanted in their home bourses.   &quot;Who's to say what's garbage?&quot; asks the financialconsultant, who asked to remain unidentified. &quot;Garbagehappens to be a very big business, and even small companieshave need of capital. You have to establish your own niche inthis world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
