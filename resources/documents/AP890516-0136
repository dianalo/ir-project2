SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. threats to pull troops from WesternEurope over the NATO short-range nuclear missile dispute are viewedas ``blackmail'' in West Germany and only aggravate tensions withinthe alliance, a leading West German Social Democrat said Tuesday.   ``It's not wise to hint and say you will withdraw your troops,''said Horst Ehmke, the chairman of the opposition party'sparliamentary group. ``It's a litte bit short-sighted.''   Ehmke, a one-time aide to former West German Chancellor WillyBrandt, spoke on the hottest issue dividing members of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization at a news conference arranged byForeign Policy magazine.   The United States and Britain want to modernize the alliance'sshort-range Lance missile force, but most West Germans and severalother West European nations oppose it.   Under the proposal, 88 missile launchers would be made morepowerful to carry their 700 or so single-warhead missiles more than250 miles. The weapons _ designed for use on the battlefield _ nowhave a range of only 75 miles. Most are on West German territory.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has irritated U.S. officialswith his objections to the modernization plan and demands fordirect U.S.-Soviet negotiations over the issue. In a rarecombination, all of the West German political parties, includingKohl's Christian Democrats and Ehmke's Social Democrats, object tothe NATO modernization plan.   U.S. officials insist the upgraded weapons are necessary todeter any attack from the larger Soviet Bloc conventional forces.And they reject the idea of direct negotiations at this pointbecause of the huge Warsaw Pact advantage.   In recent weeks, influential members of the Senate ArmedServices Committee have said they might propose a withdrawal ofU.S. forces from Western Europe if the West Germans persist intheir demands. Failing to update the missiles, those senators say,would increase risks to American soldiers in Europe.   Arguing that such an approach was ``dead wrong,'' Ehmke alsosaid he believed that the dispute among the allies had ``gotten outof hand.''   ``Let's stop all this nonsense about getting out and dissolvingthe alliance,'' he said.   ``It's not wise to hint and say that you will withdraw yourtroops. The German people will feel like (that's) blackmail,'' headded.   Ehmke, who is in Washington for talks with members of Congressand State Department officials, said the United States shouldrethink its refusal to negotiate with the Soviet Union.   ``I don't see any reason for the American fear'' aboutnegotiating, Ehmke said. ``The most dangerous position in thisrespect is the one the American administration is taking right nowby saying no negotiations.''   The official said that the heated tone of the NATO argumentshould change because it serves only to advance the image of SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the proponent of disarmament inEuropean public opinion.   ``This puts NATO on the defensive _ the most important thing isto get the initiative back,'' Ehmke argued, as a reason for theU.S. side to enter negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
