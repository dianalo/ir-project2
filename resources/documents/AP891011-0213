In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people nationwide havesigned petitions denouncing industrial threats to the environmentand the country's first ecology-oriented political party has comeinto being.   A host of environmental problems confront South Africa, rangingfrom air pollution to water shortages, but two events in particularhave galvanized the public into action.   First came disclosure of plans by a British-owned company tomine titanium in the scenic sand dunes around Lake St. Lucia, anestuary and game reserve northeast of Durban on the Indian Ocean.James Clarke, environment writer for The Str newspaper inJohannesburg, describes the area as ``one of the world's mostbeautiful and biotically rich places.''   About 200,000 South Africans have signed petitions opposing themining project, and government officials have said they will askthe company, Richards Bay Minerals, to reassess the environmentalimpact of its plans.   In September, an outcry arose when chemicals leaked into a riverin eastern Transvaal Province from a huge paper mill, killing tensof thousands of fish and disrupting water supplies for more than200,000 people.   Residents in the politically conservative area near KrugerNational Park started their own petition drive, demandinggovernment action against the Sappi paper company and expressing``dismay and outrage'' at apparently lax safety measures.   Within days after the chemical spill in the Crocodile River,environmentalists met in Johannesburg to form the Ecology Party,which has adopted a green heart as its symbol.   Colin Slater, a marketing consultant who helped found the party,said he had lived in West Germany during the emergence of theGreens movement and hoped the Ecology Party could play a similarrole in forcing South African politicians to pay more attention toecological issues.   In the past, most environmental organizations in South Africafocused on singular issues. Several groups have promoted wildlifeconservation, for example, and others opposed the use of nuclearpower by the state-run electricity monopoly. But environmentalawareness among the general public was relatively low.   One reason was that South Africans aligned against thegovernment and big business concentrated on fighting apartheid.   ``Resistance and opposition to the government and industry havebeen dominated by the burning issues of racism and exploitation,leaving little time and energy for organization around ecology,''wrote labor specialists Eddie Koch and Dirk Hartford recently inThe Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper.   But Koch and Hartford suggested that ecologists andanti-apartheid activists could find common ground in opposingpollution, the misuse of pesticides and the dumping of toxicwastes. Other commentators have suggested that the black majoritywould take a much keener interest in the environment if whites, whocontrol 87 percent of South Africa's territory, agreed to a majorredistribution of land.   The Ecology Party's Slater said the environment has sufferedneglect because of ``the tremendous day-to-day emphasis onblack-white politics.''   ``But we feel that hopefully the black-white political problemis reaching a resolution,'' he said in an interview. ``When blacksand whites are finally holding hands, let's make sure it's not in adesert.''   The National Party government, in power since 1948, is viewed bymany environmentalists as a halfhearted ally, committed inprincipal to environmental protection but often reluctant to act,possibly because industrial growth is needed to provide jobs forthe fast-growing black population.   Peter Glavovic, an environmental law expert at the University ofNatal, says the government has steered away from toughanti-pollution laws, instead giving its environment minister broaddiscretionary powers.   ``South Africa is in many respects still a developing country,''Glavovic said. ``The government clearly doesn't want tooverregulate or curtail operations so that this starts impacting oneconomic growth.''   The environment is the topic of a new book by Clem Sunter, acorporate consultant who specializes in forecasting what lies aheadfor South Africa.   The book, ``South African Environments into the 21st Century,''says droughts, floods, locust plagues, sandstorms and fires inSouth Africa during the 1980s were aggravated by shoddyconservation practices.   South Africa ``had to pay the price for over a century ofcareless environmental management and its unique experiment insocial engineering (apartheid),'' Sunter writes.   He argues that the environment will be saved only through acombination of sustained economic growth, curtailment of the birthrate and political stability.   ``People must be educated about the importance of safeguardingthe interests of future generations by protecting the environmenttoday,'' he writes. ``Wiping the slate clean of apartheid is onething ... but what replaces it is even more important.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Oct. 20</NOTE></DOC>
