Asamera said it is also considering several recapitalization options, including the purchase of some of its own stock, a distribution of cash and securities, the sale of assets and borrowings.    As previously reported, Asamera has rejected as inadequate a 456 million Canadian dollar ($365.3 million) takeover bid by Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., a Toronto-based oil and gas concern. The offer, which expires March 30, includes a bid of 10.50 dollars ($8.41) a share for Asamera's common stock. On the American Stock Exchange, Asamera's stock closed yesterday at $9.625, unchanged.    Asamera said it has set up two rooms here for interested suitors to examine confidential corporate information. It declined to name any, but said Gulf, 69%-owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, has been granted access to certain information.    The review process, and the possible recapitalization, are designed to provide &quot;shareholder value in excess of that offered by Gulf,&quot; Asamera said.    R.G. Welty, chairman of Asamera, said there isn't any assurance that transactions will be completed, but that the company is optimistic. </TEXT></DOC>
