Soviet refugees, coming out in risingnumbers, will get some of the prized future seats on Aeroflot.   Next month, American and Soviet experts in counter-terrorismtechniques will meet in Moscow to consider exchanging informationon murderous groups and how to curb them.   In September, several Soviet judges engaged in a liberalizationof the country's legal system will come to the United States tostudy American procedures.   Amid all this progress, the Soviets have not torn down theBerlin Wall or renounced the Brezhnev Doctrine, which justifiesmilitary intervention in East European countries to snuff outrebellion against Communist rule.   But the Cold War is receding.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his first trip toMoscow last week, helped push the dark shadows back more. He and ateam drawn from all over the U.S. government, started working withtheir Soviet counterparts on a framework for cooperation in CentralAmerica, the Middle East and on nine specific global problems.   These include terrorism, earthquakes and other naturaldisasters, climate changes and narcotics traffic. Baker and SovietForeign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze agreed to meet three orfour times a year, with the next session here in September.Specialists on the two sides will work out their own schedules formeetings.   As a result, the U.S.-Soviet dialogue is expanding, theopportunity for cooperation enlarged even beyond the detente era ofU.S.-Soviet reconciliation in the 1970s.   But these developments are getting slight attention. Despite astrong effort by Baker to shift the focus away from arms controland to regional problems on which the two sides could work inconcert, Mikhail S. Gorbachev rolled out two headline-makinginitiatives at their meeting Thursday in Moscow for cutbacks innuclear and conventional forces in Europe.   Knocked off-balance and cautious by nature, the Bushadministration responded slowly to the Soviet leader, whoseinitiatives were having these results:   1. Further strains within the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationalliance, already divided by a dispute over whether th improveshort-range nuclear missiles targeted on Warsaw Pact installations.   West Germany and other opponents of the missile modernizationplan are inclined to be more receptive to disarmament than thehardline U.S. and British governments. All agreed at a NATO meetingon Friday in Brussels that Gorbachev's decision to remove 500nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe was modest in comparison tothe withdrawal of 2,400 U.S. warheads over the last decade.   But Gorbachev's moves intensified the pressure for negotiatedreductions in short-range nuclear weapons on both sides that theUnited States and Britain regard as threatening to the defense ofWestern Europe.   His proposal to sharply reduce troops, tanks, artillery andother NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional forces lends support to theargument that it is safe to negotiate nuclear missile reductionsbecause the Warsaw Pact's non-nuclear edge will disappear.   Baker called the proposition hypothetical at a news conferencein Brussels on Friday. ``I'm reminded,'' he said, ``of the oldsaying back home `if the dog hadn't stopped he would have caughtthe rabbit.' I mean let's see it happen and then address thatquestion.''   2. The NATO summit meeting May 29-30 in Brussels that wassupposed to celebrate 40 years of Western unity is now more likelyto be marked by division over missiles and how to cope withGorbachev. Both Baker and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreignsecretary, failed in separate meetings this week to persuade WestGerman Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to back off demandsfor missile negotiations.   3. President Bush's long-awaited first foreign policydeclaration, delivered Friday to the graduating class at Texas A andamp;M University, appeared pallid in comparison to Gorbachev's moves.   Bush revived a 34-year-old ``open skies'' proposal first made byPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower under which NATO and Warsaw Pactcountries would allow surveillance planes from the other side tofly over their territory.   His declaration that the Soviet Union still had to earn theright to membership in ``the world order'' and to warmer relationswith Western nations seemed out of step with fast-moving events.   ``Let him do what he says unilaterally, it would be good,'' Bushtold reporters traveling with him Saturday in Mississippi. Askedwhether he was going to win the ``public relations war'' withGorbachev, Bush said he wanted to ``win the peace war.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITORS NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid, the AP's Washington-baseddiplomatic writer, just returned from the Soviet Union with thesecretary of state.</TEXT></DOC>
