<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-1051 </DOCNO><TEXT>Systematic studies of currentless plasma produced in the URAGAN-3 torsatronby RF heating at {omega} andless; or approx. {omega}/sub Hi/ have led to thediscovery of three types of discharge. The first type (called D-discharges)was encountered on working with bare, stainless steel, helical frameantennas. They were characterized by rather high densities (n/sub e/(0){le}2 x 10/sup 13/cm/sup -/3), moderate temperatures (T/sub i/(0) {le}0.3keV, T/sub e/(0) andless;= 0.23 keV) and a short pulse duration ({Delta} approx.= 3 to 4 ms) due to progressive degradation of the electron and ion temperatures.The second type (called Q-discharges) was obtained when the antenna wascoated by TiN. These discharges were characterized by long pulse duration({Delta} approx. = 50 ms), lower electron densities (n/sub e/(0) {le}4x 10/sup 12/cm/sup -3/) and higher temperatures (T/sub i/ {le}1.1 keV,T/sub e/ {le}0.3 keV). The third type of discharge (called QR-discharges)was encountered when the magnetic configuration axis was shifted outwardsby the transverse magnetic field. These discharges were characterizedby relaxation oscillations of the plasma parameters, similar to thoseof the high-{beta}S-regime of Heliotron E. 10 refs, 12 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
