Music floated through theirlives like ribbons of gold. Guy played the keyboard and was hired by a band.Marilyn worked in an office during the day and went to school at night. Shewas studying musical engineering, but aimed for a singing career. Their dreamwas that Guy would have his own band in the Happy-Ever-After and Marilyn wouldbe his vocalist.;    He wrote her a song she fell in love with, and shepromised someday she'd perform it on stage, backed by Guy. He called it,appropriately, &quot;Fairy Tales.&quot;;    &quot;Talk to stuffed animals, -- Can't they bereal? -- Make believe you live with them -- For always. . . .&quot;;    Marilyn wasthe kind of person who believed what the lyrics implied, that dreams andreality can be joined by just closing your eyes and clicking your heels. Butafter two years in the City of Angels, something began going wrong.;    Thelong, late hours spent apart, once perceived as the sacrifice that would maketheir dream come true, clawed at the fabric of their marriage and, in the end,destroyed it. They were divorced.;    &quot;It was strange,&quot; Guy says today. &quot;Wewere getting so close to what we wanted, and then I woke up one morning and itwas gone.&quot;;    He never believed the fairy tale was over, and maybe it wasn't.But a harsher reality intruded before the tale could continue. MarilynGalloway, still chasing a dream, was murdered.;    By any measure, hers wasnot a significant death in a city that records three homicides every day ofthe year. Marilyn and 12-year-old Jose Morales, a son from a previousmarriage, were found stabbed in their tiny stucco home in a rundown area ofthe waterfront.;    There was no apparent motive. The killer is still atlarge.;    As brutal as they were, their murders weren't prime time news. TheLos Angeles Times carried a brief notice in a suburban edition. That was it.;   Marilyn and her son had become statistics, certificates of death, a policeproblem.;    But there are those who will not allow to pass unsung lives thatonce burned with special fire.;    &quot;I am the mother and grandmother of themother and son slain Dec. 2, 1990 in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles,&quot;Marilyn Sloane wrote from her home in Jamesville, N.Y.;    &quot;I have searchedfor evidence of a story on their murder and can find nothing. It is upsettingto me to that this awful crime could go unreported.;    &quot;The people of LosAngeles should know that someone murdered a young mother and her child andbrought a nightmare to my family. . . .&quot;;    She sent photographs. Marilyn'sface, dark-eyed, smiling whimsically, stares out from its final imprint. Herboy wears a tie. His expression is hesitant, uncertain. I telephoned Sloane tosay that their deaths had been reported. She thanked me and said, &quot;But is thatenough?&quot;;    I guess not.;    Marilyn Galloway was one of those free spiritswhose existence was somehow larger than her surroundings. Her highs werehigher and her lows lower than almost everyone else's.;    She was a joking,teasing tomboy, her mother says, who often came home tattered and bruised fromthe risks she willingly took. She challenged life. She dared it to bedifferent.;    &quot;I never knew anyone so open to adventure,&quot; Sloane told me.&quot;She was never afraid. Could that have been her problem?;    &quot;The last timeshe phoned, she had just moved into a new place and was going to school. Shesaid, 'I'm excited, mom. Everything's going to be OK.' A few days later, wegot a call from the coroner's office. . . .&quot;;    What her daughter wanted morethan anything, her mother remembers, was a place for herself.;    &quot;That's whatshe was looking for when she went to L.A., her place . . . but she never foundit, and now she never will.&quot;;    Guy thinks about Marilyn every time he hearsthe song he wrote. &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; runs through his memory like a half-forgottendream.;    &quot;Marilyn was beautiful and I still love her,&quot; he says. &quot;We broke upfor all the wrong reasons, but I always thought I'd get her back.&quot;;    Herepeats the words of his song, softly and with feeling: &quot;It's always true, --fairy tales were made -- for me and you.&quot;;    And then he falls silent,remembering. . . .  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Al Martinez column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910309  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  811  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 9, 199100069003,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
