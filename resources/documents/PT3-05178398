Each blade has a pointed first end adapted to precede the arrow in      flight for penetration of the animal's hide and initial movement into the      animal. Each blade has one sharpened lengthwise side and one blunted side      with the outstanding spur, the blunted sides extending outwardly of the      sharpened sides when the pointed front ends overlap permitting an elastic      band to encompass both said blades to maintain such configuration for      flight and initial penetration of the animal. After penetration into the      game animal, rearwardly located outwardly protruding spurs engage the      animal's hide causing a metamorphosis whereupon the blades rotate with the      rear moving to the front to become the forward leading point. After      rotation, the sharpened blades become the leading members of the wide &quot;V&quot;      configuration for continued movement through the animal to effect a clean      kill. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention. </PAR><PAR>  The field of the invention is broadheads or points (also called arrowheads)      for arrow shafts used with a bow for hunting. More particularly, the field      involved concerns broadheads which assume one configuration during flight      and a second configuration after it strikes the target, such as to more      efficiently accomplish its function of humanely disabling and killing the      game animal. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art. </PAR><PAR>  In recent years there has been significant advances in the art of      broadheads for hunting arrows designed to cause the animal to cease its      travel by more effectively disabling and killing the animal being hunted      and while doing so, reduce suffering by the animal. </PAR><PAR>  Other inventions include the arrowhead assembly by Vance in U.S. Pat. No.      2,820,634 where two blades pivotably mounted to the head of the arrow      shaft, when striking the side of the animal, immediately begin to rotate      past each other to a expanded &quot;V&quot; configuration. The blades are initially      joined in a somewhat pointed orientation. It is noted that the sharpened      edge which is presented in the initial orientation remains the sharpened      edge in the final opened &quot;V&quot; configuration. </PAR><PAR>  The patent of Vance is modified somewhat in Rickey, U.S. Pat. No.      3,578,328, where in a similar construction, the arrow shaft body continues      beyond the front point of the two pivotable blades to form a front      piercing point. The two blades, like those in Vance, rotate past each      other when rotational movement is forced upon the blades by the blades      engaging the hide of the animal. A same sharpened edge which engages the      animal initially is the forward sharpened edge as the arrowhead proceeds      through the body of the game animal. </PAR><PAR>  Lastly, Steinbacher in U.S. Pat. No. 2,568,417 adopts the forward point of      an arrow shaft as the leading point and secures rotatable blades within      the arrow shaft forward point. The blades are rotated outwardly not      crossing each other as outstanding flanges on the blades engage the animal      after initial penetration by the forward point portion. Other U.S. patents      which show features similar to the features described above but      constructed in a different manner include Bergmann, U.S. Pat. Nos.      4,166,619; Vocal, 4,615,529; Cox, 3,738,657; and Hendricks, 3,600,835. </PAR><PAR>  All of the above prior art patents are characterized by arrowpoint bodies      which have protruding spurs or cutting blades extending outwardly from its      sides, some extending prior to the arrowpoint entering the body of the      animal and some extending after the arrowpoint has entered the body of the      animal. The extending blades or spurs appear to accomplish their function      very efficiently, i.e., that of cutting as wide a swath as possible in      order to bring the game down. </PAR><PAR>  All of the arrowheads or points illustrated above employ a cylindrical      pointed arrowhead body (with the exception of Vocal and Vance) with the      spurs or blades emerging from the body, either being pivotable near the      head of the body or at the rear of the body, some pivoting upon entering      the body of the animal and some pivoting after entry into the body of the      animal. This, of course, is not without reason since for the arrow to      travel through to its target with minimum air resistance, it is generally      necessary that the smallest point cross-section as possible be utilized.      However, the cylindrical body portion of the arrow point itself is      relatively inefficient as it contributes very little to the end results of      the arrowhead. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the relative efficiency of the arrowhead or point may well be      improved if the whole point itself comprises the blades which ultimately      rotate outwardly. Vance does present an arrowhead assembly wherein the      cutting blades also comprise the forward point, however, the blades are so      arranged that they commence rotation and open to the widest possible      configuration immediately upon hitting the hide of the animal and thus      suffer the possibility of not only dulling on the animal hide, especially      if the animal has dried mud or dirt on its side, which is highly likely,      but also being forced to engage a heavy hide in the open position on      initial penetration and thereby wasting considerable energy. In addition,      since the sharpened edges are always exposed, a safety hazard is always      presented to the hunter in handling the arrowhead prior to use. </PAR><PAR>  It is also apparent that an obvious improvement to the state of the art      exists if the rather small point on the arrow shaft necessary for guiding      the arrow to it's mark should, upon striking the animal, metamorphosis      entirely into outstanding cutting blades which bring down the game more      efficiently. </PAR><PAR>  It is also apparent that an obvious improvement exists if the sharpened      edges can be protected against dulling or operator injury prior to the      arrowhead entering the body of the game animal. Further it would also be a      considerable improvement if both blades could be locked together during      initial penetration until the heavy hide and ribs have been penetrated. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The embodiment of the invention described consists of two blades pivotably      mounted to a rearward located cylindrical body, the cylindrical body      adapted to be attached to one end of an arrow shaft. More specifically,      the two blades, which are identical in construction, are so constructed as      to form a pointed first forward penetrating portion of the hunting      broadhead (well before the cylindrical body touches the game hide). As the      hunting broadhead enters the body of the animal, outstanding spurs      attached to the blades and situated rearward of the forward section of the      blades are engaged by the animal hide or bones (ribs) on contact to cause      the blades to pivotally separate to form an inverted &quot;V&quot; configuration,      all within the body cavity of the animal. At that time, the hunting      broadhead has gone through a complete metamorphosis from a relatively      sharp and narrow pointed hunting broadhead for initial penetration to a      very wide broadhead that relies entirely upon the extending blades for      cutting while penetrating. Further, the cylindrical body never is the      predecessor of the blades. </PAR><PAR>  My first hunting point, (U.S. Pat. No. 5,046,744 issued Sep. 10, 1991)      depended upon friction between two blades to keep the blades positioned      together to form the narrow sharpened hunting point which was maintained      during storage of the hunting point, handling by the operator, and initial      flight from the bow to the animal. Further, my first hunting point also      depended upon one angled side of each of the blades of the sharpened front      edge of the point engaging the animal to keep the blades together after      initial penetration until the rearwardly located outstanding spurs engage      the animal's hide and bones. </PAR><PAR>  In my present invention, I utilize a rubber band situated at some point in      front of the outstanding spur on each blade (later discussed) as well as      side pressure created by contact to exposed edges anterior to the spurs to      keep the blades together. </PAR><PAR>  Each blade is an elongated thin piece of metal having a combination of      partially sharpened edges, blunted partially chamferred edges, and square      cut edges (edges unmodified after the blade is stamped or cut out of flat      stock). At a first or forward end is a point (formed from two angled      partially chamferred edges), with a first side joining one of the      partially chamferred edges of the pointed first end, said first side      having a long, slightly curved, sharpened cutting edge which extends to      the opposite second or rear end where it terminates in a substantially      right angle foot, the edges making up the right angle foot also being      sharpened. </PAR><PAR>  Along the second side joining the other partially chamferred edge making up      the pointed first forward end is a substantially straight partially      chamferred angled edge extending approximately 60 percent of the length of      the blade, this partially chamferred edge terminating into an outwardly      protruding spur, which spur also has a partially chamferred edge on its      forward portion. The rubber band previously discussed is preferably      retained at the intersection of the substantially straight partially      chamferred edge and the outwardly protruding spur edge. </PAR><PAR>  Proceeding rearward from the outwardly protruding spur, the falling edge of      the blade is square cut (having neither a sharpened edge nor a partially      chamferred edge), and retreats toward the first side at an angle to form a      second stop until it reaches the vicinity of the opening formed in each      blade to accommodate a pivot pin. Surrounding that opening is a      semi-circular outwardly directed protrusion. Lastly, the semi-circular      protrusion accommodating the pivot pin opening then joins with a short      straight square cut edge to form a first stop which terminates at the      right angle foot. This first stop is urged against the side of the      cylindrical body by the rubber band to define the position of each blade      forming the pointed configuration. </PAR><PAR>  Receiving two blades in a back-to-back configuration is an elongated      cylindrical body having at a first end a chamferred rounded edge (not      necessarily forming a point although it could) and at the opposite end,      male threads to be received in female threads at the end of an arrow      shaft, or any other arrangement to attach to the end of an arrow shaft. At      the first end of the cylindrical body is a lengthwise elongated slot, the      slot adapted to receive the two identical blades of the invention.      Transversely to the elongated slot and on opposite sides are openings to      secure the previously mentioned pivot pin. This pivot pin resides in the      opening of each of the two blades making up one complete hunting      broadhead. </PAR><PAR>  When the hunting broadhead is assembled, the blades are positioned so that      their back surfaces, which are completely flat not having the formed      sharpened edges or partially chamferred edges, are placed juxtaposed each      other. By this means, the surfaces making up the sharpened edges and      partially chamferred edges of each blade will be on the outside and never      hidden by the opposite blade. The hunting broadhead is assembled by      aligning each of the blade's opening over the opening in the cylindrical      body and then inserting the pivot pin into the opening on one side of the      cylindrical body, through each of the openings in each of the blades, and      into the opening on the other side of the cylindrical body so that the      pivot pin completely crosses the elongated slot. The diameters of the      openings in the cylindrical body and the pivot pin are very close to each      other so that there is a tight frictional holding relationship between the      two such as to keep the pivot pin in place once inserted, i.e., the pin is      best driven into the openings in the cylindrical body. Other means, such      as threading, may be used to retain the pivot pin in the body. However,      the opening in each of the blades is slightly larger than the diameter of      the pivot pin so that the blades freely rotate. In addition, unlike my      first hunting point, the width of the elongated slot in the cylindrical      body need no longer be sized as to frictionally compress the two blades      against each other but, may be larger. </PAR><PAR>  It is noted that when the hunting broadhead is assembled and the first      forward ends of each blade brought together to form the point of the      broadhead, the first stop of each blade is urged against the sides of the      cylindrical body. In this configuration, the sharpened first side or edge      of each blade is recessed in position behind the partially chamferred edge      of the opposite blade such that if a person were to grab the forward point      or first end (at its sides) of each broadhead, their fingers come in      contact with the two opposite partially chamferred edges and not the      sharpened edges. The point of the resulting broadhead is also formed from      two partially chamferred edges on each blade. The rubber band may be      installed upon the hunting broadhead by slipping it down over the forward      60 percent or so length of the broadhead to stop at the base of each spur.      In slipping the rubber band down over the broadhead, the band only engages      the partially chamferred edges and is thus not severed. </PAR><PAR>  The feature of utilizing the partially chamferred edge on one side of each      blade and recessing the sharpened edge back behind the partially      chamferred edge of the opposite blade (when assembled) provides an obvious      safety measure in that the operator's fingers never come in contact with      the sharpened edge so long as the hunting broadhead is handled in its      forward 60 percent of its length or so. Additionally, if the animal which      is shot has caked dirt or mud on its side, and this is very common, or if      the animal's hide is very tough, the sharpened edges of the blades never      directly engage the mud, hair, hide, or ribs or initial impact of the      animal. Thus they are protected against dulling during entry into the      animal and prior to each blade beginning its pivotal action to form the      widened &quot;V&quot; configuration whereby the sharpened edge is placed forward.      This pivotal operation commences after approximately 60 percent of the      broadhead has entered the body of the animal's body and is completed      entirely within the body cavity. </PAR><PAR>  After entry, when the two blades rotate to open, the blades reach a point      where the second stop of each blade engages the side of the cylindrical      body at which time the blades form a common sharpened point of a widened      &quot;V&quot; configuration. This point is formed by the right angle boots      previously spoken of. As the hunting point continues along through the      animal body, the rubber band may roll off each blade along its spur and      end up residing on the arrow shaft or may be cut depending upon the      hardness of the animal part interacting with the broadhead. </PAR><PAR>  To withdraw the hunting broadhead from a game animal, the hunter grasps the      arrow shaft and pulls backwardly. This causes the sharpened blades to      rotate back to their initial flight position and present minimum      resistance to the withdrawal of the arrow shaft and attached broadhead. </PAR><PAR>  The advantage of providing one edge highly sharpened for cutting and the      other edge partially chamferred for exposure at all other times provides      great benefits in the subject hunting broadheads. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of the subject invention to provide a hunting      broadhead which presents a relatively small sharp end or projection with      minimum cross-section designed to penetrate the hide of the game animal      but which, upon travel through the game, expands to provide a very sharp      cutting edge to kill the animal in the most humane way possible. By such      means, energy is not wasted in making a large surface entry opening. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the subject invention to provide a hunting point      which is most efficient and provides that the blades making up the hunting      point metamorphoses from a relatively sharpened narrow point to a broad      cutting inverted &quot;V&quot; sharpened formation. </PAR><PAR>  It is still a further object of the subject invention to provide a hunting      broadhead without a forward cylindrical body leading the arrow shaft into      the game animal. </PAR><PAR>  It is still further an object of the subject invention to provide a hunting      broadhead which provides non-sharp partially chamferred edges for handling      by the hunter so as to prevent cutting injuries to the hunter when using      the hunting broadhead. </PAR><PAR>  It is still a further object of the subject invention to provide a hunting      broadhead having sharpened cutting edges which are protected against      dulling prior to their designed time for cutting internally into the game      animal. </PAR><PAR>  Other objects of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part      appear hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the apparatus      possessing the construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of      parts which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure and the      scope of the application which will be indicated in the claims. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  For further understanding of the features and objects of the subject      invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description      taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1. is a top view of the subject hunting broadhead in a stored and      in-flight configuration; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2. is a top view of the subject hunting broadhead in a configuration      after entering the game animal where the spurs have struck the animal hide      or ribs and the blades have just started to rotationally separate; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3. is a top view of the subject hunting broadhead in its final      inverted &quot;V&quot; configuration for travel internally to the game animal; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4. is a side view of the cylindrical body of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5. is a side view of the pivot pin of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6.A. and 6.B. are top views of each of the blades which make up the      invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7. is a sectional view of the hunting broadhead taken along lines 7--7      of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  In various views like index numbers refer to like elements. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 1, a top view of the subject inventive hunting      broadhead is shown apart from an arrow shaft. Firstly, hunting broadhead      10 is made up of two elongated flat metal blades, namely first blade 12      and second blade 14, the blades so oriented that they lay or are      juxtaposed one upon another with the back sides of the blades touching      each other. </PAR><PAR>  Blades 12 and 14 are situated within an elongated slot (not shown) formed      in solid cylindrical body 16 so that they will, at the proper time, rotate      about pivot pin 18 attached to cylindrical body 16 and pass transversely      across its slot. However, the two blades are secured together in a closed      position by an elastic or rubber band 20 (or they may be tied together      with string), band 20 urging each of the blades' first stop (36 and 44)      located at the rear or bottom of each of the blades against cylindrical      body 16 whereby rotation in the direction normally urged by the rubber      band upon each blade is terminated. As shown in FIG. 1, the blades      overlap, but not completely, in that, by judicious recession of a      substantial portion of the length of each blade's sharpened edge behind      the opposite blade's partially chamferred or beveled edge, great safety      benefits are provided. Other benefits provided are discussed later. </PAR><PAR>  Also as seen in FIG.1, cylindrical body 16 is terminated in threaded shaft      17 adapted to be engaged by the threaded female opening of an arrow shaft      (not shown). </PAR><PAR>  Elongated first blade 12, which front or top face is shown, comprises a      thin flat piece of high quality steel, preferably having a thickness of      about 0.050 inch, an overall length of approximately 21/2 inches, and a      width of approximately 1 inch (including the protruding spur). Blade 12      has the top flat face of its right hand side (first side) peripheral edge      22 ground off to form a razor sharp edge which traverses substantially the      length of the blade. All sharpened edges are preferably formed this way.      In the preferred embodiment, peripheral edge 22 is slightly arcuate or      concave along its length. Peripheral edge 22 could, however, be straight. </PAR><PAR>  The top end of the blade 12 is terminated in a point 26 and the bottom end      with foot 28. At the top, joining sharpened peripheral edge 22 point 26 is      angled edge 19 which is blunted by partially chamfering or beveling. When      an edge is partially chamferred, only a portion of the right angle corner      of the edge is knocked off (by preferably grinding) so that the right      angle edge is present for approximately 15% of the blade thickness.      Blunting of an edge may also be accomplished by rounding the edge. </PAR><PAR>  At the bottom, foot 28 is formed by a blade 12 making substantially a right      angle at its joiner with sharpened edge 22. Foot terminates on its other      side in first stop 36. Along the bottom peripheral edge of foot 28, the      edge is highly sharpened as it was along sharpened edge 22. </PAR><PAR>  Opposite peripheral edge 22 and an the left hand side (second side) of      blade 12, starting at the top, angled edge 21 intersects with previously      discussed angled edge 19 to form point 26. Angled edge 21 is also a      blunted partially chamferred peripheral edge. Next, blunted partially      chamferred or beveled peripheral edge 23 recedes rearward from a second      location along a substantially straight angled line from angled edge 21      diverging from first side 22 approximately 60 percent of the length of the      blade 12 to a first location where it joins outstanding spur 30. Outwardly      protruding spur 30 also has a forward portion, partially chamferred edge      24. Residing at the first location, i.e., intersection of the second side      partially chamferred edge 23 and forward peripheral edge 24 of spur 30, is      rubber band 20. </PAR><PAR>  Proceeding rearward, outwardly protruding spur 30 falls off along its      rearward portion towards the first side along square cut peripheral edge      25, which constitutes second stop 25 later discussed. Continuing, second      stop 25 next joins a semi-circular outwardly producing extension (covered      by cylindrical body 16) which accommodates an opening receiving pivot pin      18. After the semi-circular protrusion, the left hand edge joins first      stop 36 shown resting against the cylindrical side of body 16. First stop      36 holds first blade 12 in the forward position in FIG. 1 as rubber band      20 urges first blade 12 and second blade 14 together. The first stop of      each blade engage opposite sides of cylindrical body 16. </PAR><PAR>  Shown beneath first blade 12 is second blade 14, the unmodified flat back      or underside of blade 14 visible. Second blade 14 is a duplicate of first      blade, being only reversed in position in cylindrical body 16 so that      neither its sharpened peripheral edges nor partially chamferred edges may      be seem in FIG. 1. The back side of partially chamferred second side      peripheral edge 50 and a portion of sharpened peripheral edge 48 are      shown. </PAR><PAR>  Further, second blade 14 second side outwardly protruding spur 40 is      detailed, the bottom or back side of its forward partially chamferred      peripheral edge 52 shown. The bottom of second blade 14 first side's      arcuate sharpened edge 48 is revealed emerging from below the straight      partially chamferred edge 23 and spur 30 of first blade 12. Also seen in      the back side of sharpened foot 42 and first stop 44. Again, in the      position shown, first stop 44 of second blade 14 is urged against the side      of cylindrical body 16. </PAR><PAR>  The most forward point 46 (not shown) of second blade lies immediately      beneath and is aligned with point 26 of first blade 12 and, like point 26      of first blade 12, is formed by the intersection of two partially      chamferred edges. By reducing the sharpness of points 26 and 46 with      partially chamferred edges, the safety features of the subject invention      have been additionally enhanced as the point of broadhead 10 will be less      likely to stick the person handling it. Nevertheless, points 26 and 46 are      still sufficiently sharp that they will easily puncture the hide of the      struck animal when delivered by the hunter's bow. </PAR><PAR>  With rubber band 20 at the base of partially chamferred peripheral edge 23      of the second side of the first blade 12 at the same place on the second      side of second blade 14, the two blades are held together with their first      stops engaging cylindrical body 16 to place the blades in the forward      pointed position with their respective front points overlapping. </PAR><PAR>  In the forward approximately three-quarters of the length of broadhead 10,      the sharpened edge of each blade is protected by being recessed back from      a partially chamferred edge of the opposite blade. For example, right      sharpened peripheral edge 22 of first blade 12 is recessed behind the      partially chamferred edge 50 of second blade 14 from its joinder with      angled edge 19 near point 26 to its emergence from behind second stop 45      below outstanding spur 40. It is also important to keep this sharpened      blade protected until after it has entered the body of the animal since      the hide of the animal or rib bones (or for that matter, dirt on the      animal's hide) will dull the sharpened edge. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, sharpened edge 48 second blade 14 is similarly recessed away      from the partially chamferred edge 23 of first blade 12. By such means,      the hunter can handle the subject broadhead in the forward three-quarters      of the broadhead without danger of cutting himself. Typically, sharpened      blades utilized in broadheads are razor sharp. </PAR><PAR>  Rubber band 20 then may be slipped over the blunted partially chamferred      edges of the second sides of each of the overlapping blades to position      itself at the base of the two partially chamferred forward edges 24 and 52      of spurs 30 and 40 without danger of being severed. </PAR><PAR>  While a rubber od elastic band has been suggested to secure the two blades      together, other means have also been used. For example, I have applied an      adhesive between the two blades at or near the first end. Also, it is      possible to place a dimple or detent in the blades at or near the first      end whereupon a concave dimple of one blade would reside in a convex      dimple of the other. Of course, the blades with detents would not be      interchangeable and separate blades with detents in opposite directions      would need be fashioned. In addition, not shown, but it is apparent that a      spring clip may be fashioned which would secure the lower rear end      portions of both blades in the closed position. </PAR><PAR>  The configuration of broadhead 10 shown in FIG. 1 is the configuration of      the blades during storage, during time of flight between the hunter's bow      and the game animal, and during the initial penetration of the game      animal. When penetrating the game animal, the two blades continue to stay      together until the broadhead has penetrated to a depth such that the hide      of the animal engages the forward partially chamferred peripheral edges 24      and 54 of the spurs 30 and 40 respectively. On most occasions, the animal      will be struck in the rib cage area and the ribs immediately beneath the      animal's hide will be engaged by the spurs. At that time, each blade      begins to rotate about pivot pin 18 to begin opening of the two blades as      shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. </PAR><PAR>  As previously indicated, in my prior application, I depended upon friction      between the backsides of the blades caused by carefully sizing the width      of the elongated slot in the cylindrical body to tightly compress the      blades to keep the blades in the closed position during storage, flight of      the hunting point, and initial penetration of the animal. Also, during      first few inches of penetration of the animal, the forward point of each      blade was so shaped that pressing of the flesh and internal organs against      the left hand angled edge which substantially made up the point, together      with a slightly less angled left hand portion of each blade extending from      near the point to the rear spur, continually urged the first stop of each      blade against the cylindrical body and thereby kept the blades together. </PAR><PAR>  This is not to say that a frictional relationship between the two blades to      keep them together can not be utilized in my present invention, because it      could. Such an embodiment would be obtained by carefully sizing the width      of the slot in the cylindrical body. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment of the subject invention, I no longer depend upon a      frictional relationship between the blades or a left front angled side      retreating from the point together to keep the blades together. Now I      utilize a rubber band and a long extending angled straight left side to      accomplish that feat. The angled sides situated immediately on each side      of the point of the blade are almost symmetrical, although the left hand      side is still slightly favored. Further, by my new design, the forward 60%      or so of the blades have a thinner width for easier penetration. </PAR><PAR>  In the process of modifying my original design, I have greatly enhanced the      safety features to remove the sharpened edges away from the hunter's      fingers well over three-quarters of the length of the broadhead as well as      protecting the sharpened edges from dulling at all times prior to actual      presence in the body cavity of the animal. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2, a top view of broadhead 10 is shown in a partially      open configuration such as the broadhead might encounter just as its spurs      have engaged the hide or ribs of a game animal and started rotation of      each of the blades. Note that the rubber band is now being stretched as      the blades open, the hitting force of the spurs against the hide or ribs      of the game animal being sufficient to overcome the resistance of the      rubber band holding the blades together. At this point, the forward      portion of each of the blades is interiorly the body of the game animal      and the hide or ribs of the animal are still restraining spurs 30 and 40      respectively. One additional advantage of having the forward edges of each      of the spurs not razor sharp is that any tendency on the part of the      blades to slice through the hide or the ribs and not open the blades is      considerably lessened. At this point in time, the sharpened peripheral      edges 22 and 48 of blades 12 and 14 respectively have begun to engage and      cut the interior body of the animal between the two blades, which also      helps to spread the blades. Additionally, animal flesh pressing against      rubber band 20 may at this time cause it to be severed across partially      chamferred edges 24 and/or 52. </PAR><PAR>  A more revealing picture of the back or underside of second blade 14 is      seen in FIG. 2, this side showing the flatness of the blade and the lack      of sharpened or partially chamferred edges. It is of course realized that      the peripheral sharpened edges 22 and 48 could be formed by taking equal      amounts of metal off both sides of the blade to achieve a razor sharp      edge, however, for economy of manufacture, to construct the sharpened      edge, only one side has metal removed. Also, if the blades are sharpened      to a central &quot;V&quot;, then opportunity is afforded for hair and hide to wedge      between the flat surfaces of the blade. Similarly, the partially      chamferred or beveled edges 23 and 50 (and others) might also be      constructed by partially chamferring both the top and the bottom face to      leave a flat ridge between the two chamfers (rather than a sharp cutting      edge), however again, for economy of manufacture and to prevent material      from being wedged between flat sides of the blades during penetration,      metal was removed from only one side of the blade to achieve the partial      chamfer or bevel. </PAR><PAR>  As previously mentioned, alternate embodiments of the invention may include      other means to keep the blades together, such as adhesive 60 shown at the      first end of second blade 14. The adhesive used by the inventor was a      silicone sealant. This adhesive was sufficiently strong enough to keep the      blades together in flight, in penetration and initial movement into the      animal, yet did not prevent the blades from separating when the spurs      struck the animal's hide. The adhesive was applied by placing a small      amount upon one blade end and then moving the blades together to allow it      to adhere to both blades. Then the adhesive was allowed to harden. Excess      adhesive which might ooze out between the blades was wiped off. </PAR><PAR>  Also seen in FIG. 2 is a second embodiment, namely the dimple or detent 62      placed into each blade. On the second blade 14, the dimple is concave.      First blade 12 has a convex shaped dimple or detent (not shown) which is      so aligned as to mate with dimple 62 when the blades are in the fully      closed position. The interlocking dimple or detent arrangement similarly      provides sufficient holding to keep the blades together until time for the      blades to pivot apart. </PAR><PAR>  Also seen in FIG. 2, first stop 36 of first blade 12 and first stop 44 of      second blade 14 have now left their position abutting the circular sides      of cylindrical body 16. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows broadhead 10 in its fully open position, that position assumed      by blades 12 and 14 where both foots 28 and 42 (formerly at the bottom of      each blade) now overlap with overlapping points formed from the      intersection of elongated sharpened edges 22 and 48 with sharpened foots      28 and 42 respectively. Elongated cutting edges 22 and 48 of blades 12 and      14 now are in full array to humanely kill the animal. Each of the blades      have rotated from their position shown in FIG. 2 until each of their      respective second stops engaged the circular sides of cylindrical body 16.      More particularly, second stop 25 of blade 12 and second stop 45 of blade      14 each fully engage cylindrical body 16 which keep the blades in position      shown in FIG. 3 throughout the broadhead's travel interiorly of the      animal. </PAR><PAR>  It is noted at this point that rubber band 20 has now slipped from its      position (if not severed) at the base of partially chamferred sides 23 and      50 of respective blades 12 and 14 along partially chamferred leading edges      24 and 45 of respective spurs 30 and 40. Even with rubber band 20 coming      off, if it has not been severed and if desired, it may be retrieved and      reused. It will remain upon the shaft of the arrow (not shown) when it      comes off. The alternate means of holding the blades together prior to      their opening are also shown, namely first alternate, a small amount of      adhesive 60 and second alternate, a dimple or detent 62. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side view of solid cylindrical body 16 in which the two blades      12 and 14 reside. Firstly, cylindrical body 16 has a chamferred or beveled      top conical surface 15 formed at its front so as to prevent undue      opposition to its passage in the animal's interior. Cut parallel to the      cylindrical axis of body 16 is elongated slot 33 in which resides the      semi-circular protrusion of each of the two blades 12 and 14. These      semi-circular protrusions are shown in FIGS. 6.A. and 6.B. infra. Shown      also passing through cylindrical body 16 and at right angles to slot 33 is      opening 35, opening 35 adapted to accommodate pivot pin 18 shown in FIG. 5      to secure the pivot pin across the slot. Since it is intended that pivot      pin 18 shall frictionally reside in opening 35, the diameter of opening 35      should by only slightly less than the diameter of pivot pin 18 so that the      pin may be driven in. Lastly, shaft of arrow 60 is shown attaching to the      lower portion of cylindrical body 16, arrow shaft 60 having female threads      formed in a blind cavity therein which mate with the male threads shown on      the lower portion of cylindrical body 16 in FIGS. 1-3. Of course, other      provision may be made for attaching the body 16 to an arrow shaft. </PAR><PAR>  It is noted that in the subject invention, the width of slot 33 need not be      tightly controlled as it was in my prior invention, subject of the above      referenced patent application, since I no longer depend upon friction      between the blades to keep the two blades together. Previously, the width      of slot 33 was carefully cut to ensure that the two blades rubber each      other sufficient friction therebetween that they would stay together      during storage, flight, and initial penetration of the animal. Since I now      depend upon a rubber band to keep the blades together, the width of slot      33 is no longer critical and the blades can fit more loosely therein. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a side view of elongated, cylindrical pivot pin 18 which passes      through the opening in each of the blades and is secured within opening 35      of cylindrical body 16. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 6.A. and 6.B., a top or front view of each of the      blades 12 and 14 is shown. As can be seen, each were constructed identical      to the other to simplify manufacture. When mounted in the cylindrical      body, they are placed with their flat uninterrupted back sides together. </PAR><PAR>  Commencing with FIG. 6a, at the very top is point 26 which is almost      equally divided between angled sides 21 and 19 although in the preferred      embodiment, left angled side 21 is slightly longer than right angled side      19. Both sides 21 and 19 have blunted partially chamferred edges so as not      to present a sharp cutting edge. Point 26, however, is an angled point      which has not been blunted as a point as it is formed by the two sides 21      and 19. Along the elongated right-hand or first side of blade 12,      elongated peripheral edge 22 is sharpened from a second location at its      joinder with angled side 19 wherein metal has been removed along the      surface at the edge to meet the backside of blade 12 and achieve a razor      sharp edge. Sharpened edge 22 is in the preferred embodiment slightly      arcuate along its length, but may be straight providing it does not extend      beyond the partially chamferred edge of the opposite blade when the unit      is assembled and the blades fully overlapping. At the bottom end of blade      12 is sharpened foot edge 28, the angle made between the two sharpened      edges 22 and 28 which became the front point in the configuration of FIG.      3, being just slightly less than a right angle. </PAR><PAR>  On the opposite left hand or second side of blade 12 in FIG. 6.A. is      blunted partially chamferred edge 23 which commences at the top second      location connecting with left angled edge 21 and falls back in an angled      substantially straight line diverging from the first side 22 to meet with      spur at a first location. Along the forward peripheral edge of spur 30 is      blunted partially chamferred edge 24, edge 24 at an acute angle to a      longitudinal line drawn between point 26 and the center of opening 32. The      angle of spur 30 to the longitudinal line referred to is shown at about 70      degrees. It may however be varied between 45 degrees and 90 degrees.      Outwardly protruding spur 30 then falls off downwardly with second stop 25      angled towards sharpened edge 22, second stop 25 terminating at      semi-circular protrusion 34, protrusion 34 having circular opening 32      formed in it. Opening 32, as earlier eluded to, receives pivot pin 18      shown in FIGS. 1-3 and 5 rotatably secure blade 12 to cylindrical body 16.      Opening 32 is just slightly greater in diameter than pivot pin 18 so that      while the blade will rotate easily, there is not excessive side-to-side      movement. </PAR><PAR>  Lastly, semi-circular protrusion 34 joins with first stop 36, stop 36      defining one side of sharpened foot 28. Both first stop 36 and second stop      25 provides limits to the rotation of blade 12 within cylindrical body 16,      first stop 36 serving to define broadhead 10 in a position with      penetrating point 26 forward of cylindrical body 16 for partial      penetration of the animal and second stop 25 serving to define the      position of broadhead 10 in its fully widened inverted &quot;V&quot; configuration      cutting position. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6.B. is a top view of second blade 14 (turned over from the view seen      in FIGS. 1-3) to reveal its top or front side. It has forward most point      46 formed in part by right hand or first side angled edge 47 joining with      the first side elongated sharpened peripheral edge 48 which continues in a      sweep to sharpened peripheral foot 42 at the bottom of blade 14. Like      blade 12, left angled side 43 and right angled side 47 define point 46 and      are blunted partially chamferred edges. Sharpened edge 48 is also slightly      arcuate (or it could be straight under circumstances outlined above) and      the angle it make with foot sharpened edge 42 is approximately 90 degrees.      On the opposite or second side of blade 14 in its upper part is angled      left hand edge 50, edge 50 falling substantially straight from left angled      edge 43 to the forward peripheral edge 52 of protruding spur 40. Rearward      of spur 40 is second stop 45 which falls off towards the first side edge      48 to join with semi-circular outwardly extending protrusion 66      encompassing circular opening 68, opening 68 adapted to accommodate pivot      pin 18 when blade 14 is situated in slot 33 of cylindrical body 16.      Lastly, semi-circular protrusion 66 then joins with first stop 44      immediately below, first stop 44 then forming one side of sharpened foot      42. Again, as was the case with identical blade 12, if a longitudinal line      were to be drawn from point 46 through the center of opening 68, forward      peripheral edge 52 of spur 40 would make an angle of approximately 70      degrees. </PAR><PAR>  Lastly, referring now to FIG. 7, a sectional view taken through the upper      portions of blades 12 and 14 of FIG. 1 is shown. Here, the overlapping of      the blades is more clearly seen to show the safety factor which has been      built into the invention, namely that the sharpened edges are protected      from coming in contact with the hunter's fingers when the broadhead is in      the closed position, and that the blade is protected from dulling by      recessing the sharpened edge behind the partially chamferred edge of the      opposite blade. In FIG. 7, blade 12 is shown with its sharpened edge 22      recessed behind the partially chamferred edge 50 of blade 14. Similarly,      sharpened edge 48 of blade 14 is recessed behind partially chamferred edge      23 of blade 12. In the preferred embodiment, the following are      representative of the angles the surfaces make, for example, sharpened      edges (22 and 48) are 30 degree angles and partially chamferred edges (23      and 50) are 45 degree angles, both angled relative to the flat top of      bottom of the blades. As indicated earlier, the partially chamferred edge      constitutes about 85% of the thickness of the blade and the right angle      cut portion occupies about 15% of the thickness of the blade. This, of      course, may be varied. In this configuration, so long as the blades are in      the closed position shown in FIG. 1, the hunter may grab the tip of the      broadhead without concern of being cut. Also, rubber band 20 may be pushed      down over the two blades shown in FIG. 1 without being cut as it slides      over the partially chamferred edges. </PAR><PAR>  While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described,      it is appreciated that other embodiments of the invention are possible and      that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but      rather, it is intended to cover all modifications and alternate      embodiments falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as      defined in the appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
