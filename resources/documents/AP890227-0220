The decision to hold a presidential election was originally madein 1980, but the war with Iran which broke out in September thatyear forced postponement, the report said.

The government said Sunday a referendum will be held to approvethe proposed new constitution and a new parliamentary election law,allowing new parties to form.   General elections for the 255-member National Assembly, orparliament, are scheduled for April 1 after being delayed sinceAugust.   The television gave no details about the decision to hold thepresidential election.   But it said President Saddam Hussein's office notified a TV lawprogram on the issue after a citizen asked, ``Why is the presidencya monopoly of the Baath Party?''   No presidential election has taken place in Iraq since the armyoverthrew the monarchy in a 1958 coup.   After further coups, the Baath Socialist Party ousted themilitary in a bloodless 1968 putsch with army Brigadier Ahmad Hassanal-Bakr, a former prime minister, named president.   Hussein, his vice president after 1969, became president on July16, 1979, after a peaceful transfer of power.
