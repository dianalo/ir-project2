Some lawmakers, however, believe even tougher legislation isneeded in the wake of the Energy Department's acknowledgement thatits aging reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,have experienced problems and that other plants have spewedradioactivity into the environment.   ``The main difficulty is that the Department of Energy has beenits own policeman,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., one of theauthors of a bill passed in September creating the Defense NuclearFacilities Board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors.   The board, yet to be appointed by the president, has theauthority to inspect the facilities at which the Energy Departmentmanufactures nuclear weapons for the Pentagon.   It will make recommendations to the secretary of energy, thepresident and to Congress, but it will not have the power to closedown facilities which are operating unsafely.   In the past, the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent hasoverridden concern over the environmental hazards posed by weaponsreactors.   Finding a means to balance those concerns will be expensive. Thecost of building a new generation of safer nuclear weapons reactorsis between $3.2 billion and $6.8 billion, Energy Departmentofficials say.   And it is expected to cost more than $110 billion to clean upcontamination from the reactors at the Savannah River Plant andother facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio, and Golden, Colo.   ``We quantified that as best we could, the tens of tens and tensand tens of million dollars that this government, this department,has to address in the future if it would in fact meet what webelieve is a moral obligation to rectify past sins,'' Deputy EnergySecretary Joseph Salgado told reporters.   Salgado and other department officials say they are delayinguntil early next year the reopening of the first of three reactorsat the Savannah River Plant, where they manufacture nuclear weaponsmaterials for the Pentagon.   And they announced the appointment of an extra layer of managersat the site to draft safer operating procedures for the start-up.By the end of next year, they said, all three reactors at theSavannah River Plant should be in operation.   Meantime, Richard E. Heckert, chairman of the E.I. du Pont deNemours andamp; Co., which operates Savannah River, said the governmenthas exaggerated the problems with the nuclear facility.   ``The plant is not in disarray,'' Heckert said in an interviewwith The New York Times. ``These facilities are safe, will work andwill produce and meet the nation's requirements. The operators arewell qualified and well trained.''   Du Pont, which has been operating the Savannah River facilitysince 1950, has opted to let its contract lapse. The plant will betaken over by Westinghouse Electric Co. on April 1. Heckert claimedthe government wants to criticize the plant so that Westinghousewill look good in comparison when it begins operations next year.   Pentagon officials say national security could be endangered bya prolonged delay in manufacturing one of the materials, tritium, aradioactive isotope of hydrogen, which boosts the power andefficiency of nuclear weapons.   Members of Congress are warning, however, that they want priorassurances about safety procedures before production resumes atSavannah River. And some lawmakers may demand the Energy Departmentboost expenditures to clean up past contamination.   One idea circulating on Capitol Hill is to require that EnergyDepartment reactors be monitored by the Advisory Committee onNuclear Safety, an adjunct to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,which licenses civilian atomic plants.   A panel of the National Academy of Sciences also recommended, ina report released in March 1987, that the Energy Department operateunder standards as strict as those of the NRC.   But even some of the staunchest advocates of nuclear safety saythat may not be the best immediate solution. Although the NRC hasyears of experience with reactors used by utilities, it has littlewith reactors used in making nuclear weapons materials, said JohnAhearne.   Ahearne, a former NRC chairman who is head of the EnergyDepartment's independent Advisory Committee for Nuclear FacilitiesSafety, said it could take four or five years to draw up a set ofrequirements for weapons reactors that would be as detailed thosedeveloped for civilian reactors.   ``However, some of the NRC criteria can be applied,'' he said.``The first criteria is that the plant should be constructed andoperated in such a way as it does not release radioactivity.Production goals should not be the first criteria.''   Until those standards are worked out in more detail, and untilthe Defense Nuclear Facilities Board is appointed and hires itsauthorized 100 employees, members of Congress say they will overseethe safety of Energy Department reactors.   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Governmental OperationsCommittee, and Rep. Mickey Synar, chairman of the House GovernmentOperations subcommittee on Environment, Energy and NaturalResources, have vowed to key a close eye on efforts to restart thefacility.</TEXT></DOC>
