Rep. Barney Frank said Tuesday the House Judiciary Committee willconsider amending the Ethics in Government Act to revise provisionsNofziger used successfully in appealing his 1988 conviction.   ``We saw it as a potential loophole,'' said Frank, aMassachusetts Democrat.   In a 2-1 decision Tuesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saidNofziger's conviction must be set aside because it wasn't based on afinding that he had knowledge of each element of the offense.   He was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, of three counts of illegallylobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients afterhe left the White House one year into the Reagan administration. Theclients were scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineersunion and the manufacturer of the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.   The appeals court said Tuesday that in order for a conviction tobe valid, the prosecution must demonstrate that Nofziger knew thematters on which he lobbied were already of ``direct and substantialinterest'' to the White House.   The proposed amendment would eliminate the provision requiringknowledge of each element of the offense, said Frank, chairman ofthe House subcommittee on administrative law. Congress passed asimilar measure last year but it was vetoed by President Reagan.   Independent counsel James McKay, who prosecuted Nofziger, said hewill consider appealing. He could seek a review by the federalappeals court in Washington or by the Supreme Court.   A five-year statute of limitations could make it impossible tobring revised criminal charges.   His conviction was reversed in a decision written by U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals Judge James Buckley, joined by Judge StephenWilliams, both Reagan appointees. The third member of the panel andlone dissenter was Judge Harry Edwards, a Carter administrationappointee.   Nofziger, the White House political director in 1981, beganlobbying his former colleagues within months of leaving thegovernment. He said he was trying to stimulate their interest invarious matters, which would not be a violation of the one-year banon lobbying an ex-employee's former government agency.   The case against Nofziger was the first major test of therevolving-door provisions of the Ethics in Government Act.   ``I don't think I am part of any revolving-door syndrome,'' saidNofziger. ``People lobby in this town; the main industry in thistown besides government is lobbying.''   Asked whether he thought he got off on a legal technicality,Nofziger said, ``Absolutely no ... I think they came after me on atechnicality.''   Nofziger said he was pleased by the decision. ``I think I wasinnocent from the beginning; I still think I am innocent,'' he said.   The court ruling won praise from President Bush and otherhigh-level administration officials.   Bush, asked about the ruling at a state dinner Tuesday nighthonoring Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke, smiled broadly andsaid only, ``I'm always glad when somebody is found not guilty ofsomething.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the decision``terrific,'' adding, ``There's no doubt in my mind and never hasbeen that he did not intend to break the law.''   Bush said he had not spoken with Nofziger since the decision, butChief of Staff John Sununu said he called Nofziger to congratulatehim.   ``I kind of felt that it was important that he know that at leastsome of his old friends hadn't forgotten him,'' Sununu added.   Nofziger had been sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined$30,000. He said that defending himself cost over $1.5 million inlegal fees and possibly more than that in lost income.</TEXT></DOC>
