They have pushed 668 kilometers, about 415 miles, through dunes and canyons in today's leg of this grueling race, in a day that has seen one participant killed and three critically hurt.    At the campsite, a group of Europeans dine on roast lamb and mashed potatoes, washed down with an excellent 1982 Saint Emilion. Then, after they head to bed, small boys run out of the darkness and begin picking bones from their plates.    The scene cuts to the heart of controversy that has haunted the race since it was founded 10 years ago. To participants, it is one of the world's last great adventures, three weeks of brutal and dangerous racing through 7,979 miles of desert, bush and towns in five African countries. To critics, it is a tasteless flaunting of money and power in one of the poorest regions in the world.    &quot;It's an insult to Africa,&quot; charges Jeanne Gouba, an aid worker from Burkina Faso. &quot;It's like a Western in which Africans play the role of Indians.&quot;    What particularly irks the critics is the display of consumer-products stickers on cars and uniforms, in countries that are barely surviving. With international media attention drawn to a struggle of man and machine in photogenic surroundings, the rally has become a huge traveling advertisement.    It is called the Pioneer Paris-Dakar Rally this year, sponsored by the Japanese electronics firm. Camel and Marlboro cigarettes each support a team, as do Novotel hotels and Casa Nostra Pizzaria of Paris. There is even an official drink, Coca-Cola. To make sure drivers get a fresh Coke at each leg, the company sends a refrigerated plane and four refrigerated Land Rovers. This in a region where women may walk a mile to fetch water.    Now, with the brutal conditions of the race taking more lives than ever, controversy is flaring over the danger and the gap between conditions for amateur drivers and for pros.    But the criticism of the Paris-Dakar rally isn't universal, certainly not in poor African towns. Here in Arlit, a sand-swept settlement guarded by high clay walls, drivers and navigators rise in the dark after an abbreviated night's rest to resume the battle. The Sahara, exalted by writer Michel Tournier as &quot;a place of . . . meditation to be crossed slowly and respectfully,&quot; today has the look of a superhighway. One car after another takes off for the day's leg, a circuitous 466-mile route through the rocky desert to Agadez, Niger.    Maijardie Issa, an accountant at a uranium mine, has come out with friends to watch. As the cars zoom by, he excitedly takes pictures of the more spectacular ones. &quot;This is a change from camel races,&quot; he says. &quot;It's recreative and instructive.&quot; He has one regret: &quot;We'd be happy if we could find some of the things they advertise on the cars.&quot;    Standing nearby, 31-year-old Garba Moussa, a mechanic, is even more excited. He knows everything about the race: who has the lead, who has dropped out, who is driving many of the cars, motorcycles or trucks that roar past. &quot;I think the race is good,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a small place where there isn't much to do, so it's hard to be against it. It's the most important event of the year.&quot;    Mr. Moussa would love to be part of it. &quot;I would make all the sacrifices in the world to participate in the race,&quot; he says. &quot;But you have to be a European. These vehicles are far too expensive for us. Young Africans don't have the means, so they can only admire the race.&quot;    Only one African is in the race, Mano Dayak, operator of a travel agency in Agadez, the next stop. In Agadez, a dusty city of 40,000 that is the gateway between the Sahara and the Sahel, the windfall brought by the race is even more obvious. &quot;This is a desert town where nothing happens. One plane lands here every two weeks,&quot; Mr. Dayak says. But this day, planes are parked all over the place. Several are just in from Paris with guests of the racing teams' sponsors.    Here, the racers get a day off. They stroll through the markets in search of souvenirs, eat in restaurants or buy spare parts and fuel in garages. &quot;For a town like Agadez, this is the best day of the year,&quot; says Mr. Dayak, who is out of the rally with a broken transmission. &quot;We start stocking up three months in advance for this. Artisans from all over the region make jewels to sell and people bring in food.&quot;    Near the camel market, villagers are butchering lambs. At a service station, gasoline is selling for three times its usual price. Hoteliers are cashing in, as are residents who rent out their houses.    Tiado Fati, a schoolteacher, even sees educational value in the race: &quot;It awakens the children,&quot; she says. &quot;It's an opportunity for them to see things they would never see and to ask questions.&quot; Among the questions they ask, however, are where can they get some of the cigarettes they see the drivers smoking.    Ould Sidi Mohammed El Bechir, a Mauritanian diplomat in Paris, complains that all this reinforces a feeling of inferiority in Africa: &quot;When you see a car go by at 200 kilometers an hour when your camel walks 20 kilometers a day, the camel no longer seems the height of comfort. You want something that's out of your reach.&quot;    Rene Dumont, a French development expert, sees tragedy in that: &quot;Paris-Dakar exalts the automobile, and the automobile has contributed to the ruin of Africa; everything that makes people desire cars is an obstacle to development in Africa.&quot; To accommodate the desire for cars, he contends, governments have drained money from rural development to build highways, aggravating the food shortage and worsening urban flight.    None of this is on racers' minds as they prepare for another 450 miles or so of rocks, weather extremes and dust. Having begun New Year's Day at Versailles, driven through France and crossed the Mediterranean by ship, then endured the rigors of Algeria's desert, they are interested above all in surviving. As on other days, some today will get lost, some will break down, and others, perhaps driving on no sleep or trying to pass in impenetrable dust, may crash. The race has been made particularly difficult for its 10th anniversary so that those who finish will have &quot;a label of quality,&quot; says Gilbert Sabine, its organizer.    He needn't worry. So far, two participants have died, a child has apparently been struck and killed, two racers have received paralyzing injuries and close to 30 more have been seriously hurt. Of the original 630 contenders, fewer than 200 remain in the race. Fewer still will arrive in Senegal when the race ends Friday.    &quot;This is going too far,&quot; says Cyril Neveu, a five-time winner in the motorcycle category. &quot;It's already the world's most dangerous race, but doing it on a motorcycle now is pure folly.&quot;    The hazards compound the gap between amateurs and professionals. Those who are part of a team can leave their cars to mechanics at the end of a long day and go off to sleep. Amateurs often have to spend most of the night fixing their vehicles and seeking food and fuel in an unfamiliar place.    This is contrary to the spirit of the race, some say. &quot;It should get hard progressively,&quot; says Ari Vatanen, a Finnish driver who won last year.&quot;This way, it's unfair on amateurs. Many of them wouldn't make it to Dakar anyway, but they should at least get to stay in the race for a week.&quot;    So, in addition to the criticism of those who say the race exploits Africa, now there is controversy over its rigors. The outcry is such that the International Federation of Automotive Sports has warned that the rules must change.    But the brutal and capricious demands of this race are what it is all about, says Mr. Sabine, the organizer. He ought to know: His son Thierry, who founded it, was killed two years ago when a helicopter he was riding in during the race crashed in a sandstorm.    Making the Paris-Dakar rally less perilous, Mr. Sabine says, might kill it. &quot;Today,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm incapable of telling you if there will be another one or not.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
