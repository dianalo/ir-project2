Police announced the arrest of Lee Chang-bok, a leader of thenation's main dissident alliance, the United National DemocraticMovement. They said he was arrested on charges of violatingnational security laws.   Officials said Lee, 51, had supported communist North Korea andorganized strikes and violent demonstrations.   Later, police authorized the nationwide roundup of 90 students,workers and others involved in anti-government strikes andprotests. The number includes 25 student radicals, police said.   The government began putting more pressure on the leftistmovement after six riot policemen were burned to death in a clashwith radical students in the southern city of Pusan last week.   President Roh Tae-woo warned May 3 that he would invokeemergency measures to halt the violent protests and strikes. Hecharged that dissidents were attempting to stage a leftistrevolution under the control of North Korea.   Also Monday, the Defense Ministry warned it would use ``strongcountermeasures'' to keep key defense industries running if theyare hit by strikes. Officials said troops could be used to keepplants operating.   Defense officials, who declined to be identified, said strikesin defense industries were illegal and warned that anyoneorganizing labor unrest would be ``severely punished.''   The government says strikes cost the economy almost $4 billionin lost production this year.   Radical students and other radical anti-government groups havelittle public support because of their violent tactics and extremepolitical views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrowof Roh, the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers andfarmers, and reunification with North Korea.   Meanwhile, the National Assembly opens Tuesday for a 20-daysession that will include debate on whether to ban firebombs.   Ruling and opposition lawmakers have agreed in principle toenact a new law outlawing firebombs, a weapon commonly used inanti-government demonstrations. But some opposition parties demandthat tear gas, a riot-control weapon used by police, be alsocontrolled as well.   South Korean newspapers reported Monday that Roh, in response toan opposition demand, may reshuffle his Cabinet and remove someministers for failing to adequately deal with the protests.</TEXT></DOC>
