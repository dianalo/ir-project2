And while his message will be reconciliation and justice, it's clear there will be more strife in Chile before there's healing.    After 13 years of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, wounds such as those of Estella Ortiz Parada aren't uncommon. Dressed in black, surrounded by her four children, she speaks with a pain that sometimes spills over into anger. &quot;I am impatient, because the criminals who killed my husband are still free and the methods they employed are still used,&quot; she says.    Two years ago, Jose Manuel Parada, a social worker and Communist Party member, was grabbed by armed men in central Santiago. He and two friends were found a day later outside the city, their throats slit. A judicial investigation implicated a military police intelligence unit, but no charges have ever been brought.    Such brutality -- state-orchestrated kidnappings followed by torture or murder -- has been documented for several years by human rights groups. It has helped polarize a society in which hatred, mistrust and despair make change difficult.    &quot;With the pope we will be looking for anything to build our hopes on, even agrain of sand,&quot; says housewife Isabella Vasquez.    Thus the pontiff's words are sure to be studied with something like the intensity that marked his visits to his native Poland. But Gen. Pinochet has tightened his hold on the country, and democracy seems as elusive as in the pontiff's homeland.    Nevertheless, the pope seems determined to take a firm stand. Already, in comments to reporters before his arrival in Chile yesterday, he has called the Chilean government &quot;dictatorial&quot; and indicated he would be sharply critical of the human-rights record of the 71-year-old Gen. Pinochet. The pope could thus galvanize Chile's fragmented opposition parties, which are already talking about the church's part in bringing down dictators in Haiti and the Philippines. Indeed, the pope told reporters he thought it was &quot;necessary&quot; that the church play the same leading role it did in the largely Roman Catholic Philippines that led to the downfall of Ferdinand Marcos.    &quot;The church is in Chile to promote the victory of good over evil, love over hate . . . and truth over lies,&quot; John Paul told the crowds that greeted him at Santiago's airport. &quot;I am here to give new life to your hopes.&quot;    The pope's stay also will be punctuated with emotionally charged events that could inject new purpose and courage into the cowed opposition. Today, the pope addresses 100,000 young Chileans in the national stadium, which was used to detain thousands of suspected leftists after the 1973 coup that overthrew Salvador Allende's Marxist government. Many detainees were tortured and hundreds executed, according to human-rights groups.    But although it's inevitable that the pope's stay in overwhelmingly Catholic Chile will heighten tension, it's unlikely to offer any resolutions. Few expect the visit to threaten a president who has consolidated his position in the past six months.    The attempted assassination of Gen. Pinochet in September, and the simultaneous discovery of large arms caches, lend credence to the president's repeated message that only he stands between Chile and communist destabilization. By revealing a sophisticated leftist military strategy, these events also exacerbated chronic divisions between the socialist and communist left on the one hand, and centrist parties led by the Christian Democrats on the other. The left, center and right each controls about one-third of the electorate.    &quot;Certainly, the opposition is more divided than last year,&quot; says Communist Party leader Patricio Hales. &quot;And without a united opposition, the current regime could last until the next century.&quot;    At the same time, Gen. Pinochet has been helped by an improved economy and an easing of U.S. pressure on him stemming from the perception in Washington that a real leftist threat exists in Chile. He also has been able to use the clout he gained through the attempt on his life to purge more than a dozen top army officers and quash what Western diplomats say was opposition to his leadership.    Meanwhile, the armed forces, viewed by many as the real key to change, appear more responsive than ever to Gen. Pinochet's warnings of a communist threat and possible reprisals if they leave power.    Following the collapse last year of the extreme left's terrorist tactics and the center's attempts at mass social mobilization, a campaign for multiparty presidential elections in 1989, replacing the one-candidate plebiscite prescribed by the constitution, has become the main plank of the moderate opposition.    It has been helped by the emergence of a new civilian right-wing grouping, Renovacion Nacional, which has also pledged itself to work for the multiparty poll. But most observers perceive this drive as too dislocated to make much impact. They suggest that, at best, moderates could succeed in persuading the junta to pick a candidate other than Gen. Pinochet for the scheduled 1989 plebiscite. Anyone approved in this plebiscite would rule until 1997. If the candidate is rejected, elections are supposed to be held in 1990.    It is in this confused jostling for position that the pope's presence could have a limited impact -- &quot;not a miracle&quot; in the words of Christian Democrat Jorge Jimenez de la Jara, &quot;but a contribution to the fight for democracy.&quot; This seems more likely because, while other opposition forces have become demoralized, the Chilean church has emerged as a vocal opponent of the military regime.    Statements from bishops such as Carlos Camus and Tomas Gonzalez condemning human-rights abuses, and even, in Bishop Camus's case, defending the morality of the assassination attempt, haven't been disavowed by the local episcopal conference. And although these men are clearly among the most outspoken churchmen, leading Jesuit Renato Hevia believes they are broadly representative of a church that is &quot;90% opposed to the military regime.&quot;    If, as seems certain, the pontiff supports the position of the local church -- as he did during his visit to the Philippines -- this could erode Gen. Pinochet's position in the run-up to 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
