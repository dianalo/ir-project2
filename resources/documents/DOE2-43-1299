Federaland provincial governments attempted to support the industry by introducingnew incentive programs and eliminating the petroleum and gas revenuetax. Exploratory drilling fell 41% to 1,955 wells, and development drillingwas down 56% to 3,429 wells. Exploratory success rate dropped marginallyto 55%. Land sale revenues fell by 67% and average price per hectaredecreased in all provinces. Drilling in Alberta continues to dominatewestern Canada with 78% of the total activity; the premier discoveryof the year was made in the Devonian Swan Hills Formation at Caroline.British Columbia activity declined 30% while the average well depth increasedby 24%. Active areas included Noel/Kelly, Flathead Valley and the Halfwaytrends near Fort St. John. In Manitoba, most of the activity centeredaround the Waskada, Pierson, and Daly areas. In the Northwest Territories-Arcticregion, total drilling activity decreased almost 20% but explorationdrilling increased by 15%, with all of that increase coming from onshoreactivity. The most significant discovery was the Amauligak I-65A well;proven additional reserves on the Amauligak structure are estimated at110-125 million m/sup 3/ of recoverable oil. The most significant gasdiscovery of 1986 was made by Esso at the Hansen G07 well, which testedgas and condensate from the Tertiary Kugmallit Formation. Saskatchewanactivity plummeted to 27% of its record high 1985 levels. A rebirth ofhope for prospects of deep Saskatchewan oil was caused by the Tablelanddiscovery in the southeast. Exploration activity was concentrated inareas of lighter crude oil and gas potential. 2 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
