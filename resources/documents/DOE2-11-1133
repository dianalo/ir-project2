The examples used were taken from the Permian coal measuresof Eastern Australia, i.e. they represent palaeo-environments characterisedby the ascent of a deciduous Gymnosperm flora and pronounced seasonalchanges between cool and moist summers and cold winters. In order toascertain the wider applicability of the model a combined sedimentologicaland coal petrographical study of the Carboniferous coal measures in theRuhr Basin of West Germany is currently in progress. The present paperis a status report on the work carried out so far and gives an overviewof the main characteristics of both coals and interseam sediments. 1ref., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
