Businesses swallowed each other up with a vengeance, regardlessof size; and those that tried to resist were forced to make drasticstructural changes. To finance these acquisitions, leveraged buyoutsor restructurings many firms turned to the $180 billion public``junk'' bond market _ where companies whose credit ratings arebelow investment grade offer high interest rates to compensate forbigger risks.   Once a last resort in public financing, junk bonds played apivotal role in the wave of takeovers this past year and have gainedwider acceptance, and perhaps even more respect in the eyes ofinvestors and corporate executives.   ``As more and more companies use high-yield debt to finance theirgrowth ... it becomes a regular alternative in terms of raisingcapital,'' said Robert S. Waill, managing director for high-yieldresearch at L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co. ``It's almost commonplace.''   But all that has come at the expense of the high-grade corporatemarket, which includes the elite 5 percent of U.S. companies withinvestment-grade ratings, the nation's bread-and-buttermanufacturers. Fears of large corporate takeovers, and even biggerdebt loads, scared many investors away from bonds of indust~companies this past year.   Non-investment-grade companies are drawn to the junk bondmarket's seemingly endless supply of funds, especially since it hasenabled them to offer a price high enough to persuade a targetcompany's shareholders to sell.   Tax laws also have made junk bond financing attractive byallowing interest payments to be deducted as a cost of doingbusiness. Companies that raise money through issuing new stock can'tdo the same with stock dividends.   And it costs less to borrow from the public than banks, eventhough junk bond yields are usually around four percentage pointshigher than comparable Treasury bonds.   As of mid-December there were 148 public junk bond issues valuedat $27.17 billion, 56 percent of which were used primarily forfinancing LBOs or acquisitions, according to the independentfinancial-research firm Securities Data Co. Just three years ago,about 27 percent of the $13.19 billion in junk bond issues were usedtoward acquisitions, it said.   Bond investors and traders are bracing for a deluge of big issuesin 1989, largely as a result of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'srecord $24.5 billion buyout of consumer products giant RJR NabiscoInc.   While the bulk of the financing, $14 billion, will come from acommercial bank syndicate, $5 billion will be through junk bonds.Another $5 billion of existing RJR bonds is certain to be downgradedto junk since the enormous debt load will make it harder for RJR topay off previous debts, therefore increasing the risk factor.   It was that deal and other megadeals and proposals _ includingPhilip Morris Co.'s $12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc. _ thatsent the industrial bond market into a frenzy this past year. Bondprices plummeted and trading came to a virtual standstill on fearsthat any company, regardless of size, could become a takeover targetor aggressor, and in the process load itself up with new debt.   The so-called ``event risk'' fears consequently have hurtsupplies. In November alone domestic industrial corporations soldonly two new bond issues in the United States, totaling about $250million. That was down sharply from six bond issues totaling $1billion the previous month.   While investors suffered some losses on industrial bonds, they'veseen their rate of return on junk go up.   Marshall B. Front, who manages mutual funds for the investmentbanking firm Stein Roe andamp; Farnham, said the high-yield bond portfoliohas a rate of return of 11.25 percent, compared with 7.2 percent forthe investment-grade bond portfolio and 17 percent for equities.   ``The interest rates are very high and to some extent high-yieldpaper represents less volatile surrogates to equities,'' said GeneWong, a managing director at Prudential-Bache Securities.   Although mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds holdmost of the outstanding junk bond issues, around 70 percent, foreigninterest has increased significantly. Foreign market share nowtotals around 3 percent, compared to just a small fraction a fewyears ago, according to a General Accounting report released inFebruary and analysts.   The last six years of economic expansion have been a boon to thejunk market by helping to keep defaults down, but many portfoliomanagers worry that an economic turndown will reverse that trend.   ``We're concerned that the junk bond default rate has not beentested in recent conditions and therefore we're not certain that thetotal returns from junk are what they appear to be,'' said Philip R.Roberts, a senior vice president for Aetna Life and Casualty Co.   Aetna's $65 billion investment portfolio includes only $200million of junk bonds.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
