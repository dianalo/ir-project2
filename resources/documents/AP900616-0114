Several hundred shopkeepers and craftsmen from the southernYugoslav republic of Macedonia blocked the border with cars andtrucks early Friday.   Thousands of vehicles were backed up at the three border postsby early afternoon when a local radio station called for an end tothe blockade, said Prokopios Mantzouranis, Greece's consul in theMacedonian capital of Skopje.   Macedonia is one of the six republics that comprise Yugoslavia.   Demonstrators were demanding the abolition of Greek visas forYugoslavs and recognition for ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Thedemonstration was similar to a one-day border traffic blockade onMay 19.   Greece does not recognize Macedonians as an ethnic minority.   The Foreign Ministry said Saturday the Yugoslav ambassador inAthens was summoned ``and the necessary representations were made.''   The Greek ambassador in Belgrade conveyed a similar protest tothe Yugoslav Foreign Ministry on Friday. Greece also protested tothe European Commission that Yugoslavia was isolating Greece fromthe rest of the community.   Yugoslavia forms the principal land link between Greece andother European Community members.</TEXT></DOC>
