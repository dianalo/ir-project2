Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp., hassaid that it sold Delft infrared imaging sensors, used in thenight-vision equipment. Hughes said it supplied the parts onthe understanding that they would be used by the Dutchmilitary.   In January, the State Department ordered Hughes to stopsending the parts to Delft.

There was no indication of whether any Delft Instrumentsofficials would be dismissed as a result of theinvestigation. A spokesman for the company couldn't bereached for comment.   Delft Instruments said its Belgium-based OIP Instrubelsubsidiary shipped night-vision systems to Iraq in December1989 and April 1990. The company added that &quot;it appears that&quot;another such sale was made in December 1990 to Jordan, whichsympathized with Iraq.   Because the systems included U.S. parts, a re-exportlicense from the U.S. was required, Delft Instruments said.&quot;In conflict with explicit company guidelines,&quot; the companysaid, &quot;no such license was applied for.&quot;   In 1988, a Dutch appeals court fined Delft Instruments'predecessor company, Oldelft, 25,000 guilders ($14,500) forexporting night-vision systems to Iraq in the early 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
