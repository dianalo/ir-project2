The GBA-5/16 vehicleis based on the ATS-59 artillery caterpillar tractor. The GBA-5/16 vehiclehas 5.50 m{sup 3} of water tanks and a 0.5 m{sup 3} foaming agent tank,it travels at a speed of 25 km/h and weighs 7,500 kg. The water-foamsystem uses a pressure of 2 MPa. The vehicle is equipped with a 220 kWengine. Due to its low unit pressure (0.07 MPa) it can be used in mineswithout roads. Cost of maintenance and service is low due to an originalwater tank design that allows the tanks to be hinged to each side ata 45 degree angle. The GBA-5/16 fire-fighting vehicle was successfullytested in the Adamow mine and has been patented in Poland.</TEXT></DOC>
