(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   TV evangelist Jim Bakker was convictedtoday of fleecing followers of $3.7 million so that he couldsurround himself with everything from Rolls-Royces to gold-platedswan-shaped bathroom fixtures.   A federal jury deliberated a day and a half before convictinghim on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy for overselling timeshares, or ``partnerships,'' at his PTL empire's resort hotels toloyal followers of his ministry.   The 49-year-old baby-faced preacher could receive up to 120years in prison and $5 million in fines at sentencing Oct. 24.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter freed Bakker on $250,000 bailbut said he did so reluctantly because of Bakker supporters' ``JimJones mentality'' _ a reference to the 1978 murder-suicide of 900cult followers in Jonestown, Guyana.   Defense attorney George C. Davis said he would appeal.   Bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read. Tearswelled in wife Tammy's eyes. As the couple left court, Mrs. Bakker,who was not charged in the case, sang, ``On Christ, the solid rockI stand. All other ground is sinking sand.''   Then she said, ``It's not over until it's over.''   Prosecutors said Bakker diverted donations and accepted fatbonuses to live in style, buying fancy cars, Rolex watches,diamonds, an air-conditioned doghouse and homes with giganticwalk-in closets, motorized bedroom drapes and a $500 shower curtain.   ``The message is you can't lie to the people and use televisionand the mails to get them to send you money,'' said prosecutorDeborah Smith. ``It doesn't matter who you are or how well knownyou are, you simply can't do it.''   Jury foreman Ricky Hill said the prosecution ``did an excellentjob. We kept looking for something from the defense and we neversaw it.''   ``I believe he began in earnest. He was called by God. Buteventually the money became too much for him,'' Hill said. ``He wasa man of God. He got corrupt and I feel sorry for the man.''   As they awaited the verdict in the courtroom, supporters heldBibles opened to Psalm 17, which reads: ``Thou hast tried me, andshalt find nothing.''   Prosecutors contend Bakker raised $158 million by sellingpartnerships at his Heritage USA theme park near Fort Mill, S.C.Partners typically paid $1,000 for the promise of three nights'lodging annually at the park.   The government charged that PTL sold 153,000 partnerships from1984 to 1987 but that it made only 258 rooms available, that onelarge hotel and other promised facilities were never completed andthat many partners couldn't get rooms.   The prosecution had portrayed Bakker as a con man who cynicallyused the nation's airwaves to fleece his followers. The soft-spokenBakker depicted himself on the stand as a man of God who was inover his head when it came to business.   ``My faith was that he would be set free on all charges,'' saidBill Fisher, a Bakker supporter in Fort Mill. ``I still believe hewill. I know Jim thinks the same way and God will see him throughit.''   The Rev. Robert Dugan, a spokesman for the National Associationof Evangelicals, said the conviction may help dispel thedisenchantment many Americans had developed toward religiousbroadcasting in general.   ``If he had managed to get off the hook, it probably would haveleft the public with some doubts,'' he said.   The Rev. Dean M. Kelley, director for religious liberty of theNational Council of Churches, said of the scandal: ``It sort ofElmer Gantry'd all of us'' _ a reference to the Sinclair Lewisnovel about a con man-preacher.   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who briefly took over PTL after Bakker'sdownfall, said he was sorry for the Bakkers and others hurt in thescandal but ``pleased that this dark chapter of religious historyhas concluded.''   ``I am confident that the work of God, which is far bigger thanany one man or church, will flourish in the days and years ahead inan unprecedented way,'' he said.   The verdict came after a tumultuous five-week trial that beganAug. 28.   Bakker was committed to a mental hospital for a psychiatricevaluation Aug. 31 after lawyers said he was hallucinating andcowering with his head under a couch. He was pronounced competentto stand trial Sept. 6 after a government psychiatrist said he hadhad a panic attack. The attack came one day after a PTLexecutive-turned-government-witness collapsed on the stand.   Before the collapse of their $180 million evangelical empire andBakker's resignation in 1987 in a sex and money scandal, Jim andTammy Bakker were among the most successful of the TV preachers.They produced the ``PTL Club'' show and built the 2,300-acre themepark.   Bakker quit PTL when it was revealed that he had a hotel roomliaison with onetime church secretary Jessica Hahn in 1980 and thatshe was paid more than $250,000 in hush money. He later wasdefrocked, PTL went into bankruptcy and Heritage USA was closedafter its sale to a Canadian businessman fell through.   The Bakkers now live in Orlando, Fla., and have beenbroadcasting ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' from what had been anabandoned shopping center.   ``You can't tell half-truths,'' prosecutor Smith told the jury.``If you do it, if you use the Postal Service and the publicairwaves you will find yourself in federal court answering chargesof mail and wire fraud. That's why we're here today, because that'sjust what Mr. Bakker did.''   ``The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that thedefendant had specific intent to commit fraud,'' said Davis. ``Hewas conducting a ministry. He was doing what he thought was vitalto the survival of his ministry.''   Three former Bakker aides already convicted in the casetestified against him.   His former second-in-command, Richard Dortch, testified thatBakker purposedly misled his viewers into buying partnerships heknew they would never be able to use and said he considered thepartnerships a ``gold mine.''   Dortch pleaded guilty in a plea bargain and drew an eight-yearprison term and a $200,000 fine.   Former aides David Taggart and his brother James, the ministry'sdecorator, were convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million in PTLmoney used for personal expenditures. David got more than 18 yearsin prison and James more than 17.</TEXT></DOC>
