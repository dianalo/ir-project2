(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thirty protesters from the MinnesotaChippewa Tribe occupied the lobby of tribal headquarters for asecond day Tuesday to protest a hunting and fishing rightsagreement between the tribe and the state.   Protesters said they would stay until elected tribal officialsmeet with them. They brought food, blankets and a television setinto the building, which also houses the local office of the U.S.Bureau of Indian Affairs. The protesters were not barring entry tothe BIA offices.   Tribal officials have told the protesters they would have towait until a regular tribal committee meeting April 28 in GrandPortage to talk with tribal leaders.   On Monday, tribal officials threatened to call police if theprotesters remained in the headquarters building after the 5 p.m.closing time. But Cass County Sheriff Jim Dowson said Monday night,``they haven't called and I'm not going to do anything about itunless they're harming people.''   No problems have been reported.   The protesters have said their leaders reached agreement withthe state on hunting and fishing rights in northeastern Minnesotawithout consulting the members. They also said the agreement,approved by Legislature and signed by Gov. Rudy Perpich last week,gives away their hunting and fishing rights for a fraction of theirworth.   The agreement, the protesters argue, violates federal law byinterfering with the Treaty of 1854 between the United States andthe Anishinabe Nation, whose anglicized name is Chippewa.   The agreement requires the Fond du Lac, Boise Fort and GrandPortage Chippewa bands to abstain from exercising full hunting,fishing and gathering rights reserved under the 1854 treaty.   In exchange, the three bands would received $5 million annually.   The agreement does not affect hunting and fishing onreservations, but requires Indians to give up their rights underthe treaty to hunt and fish free of state restrictions onnon-reservation land.   The area involved covers about 10,000 square miles among thethree tribes and reaches roughly from the Snake River, north to theCanadian border near the mouth of the Vermillion River and east toLake Superior.</TEXT></DOC>
