The rise in the consumer price index was at a 5.8% compound annual rate, the Labor Department said, following July's increase of 0.2%, or a 2.9% annual pace.    The August rise was the biggest since a 0.7% jump in January. It was sharper than most predictions and renewed fears among some economists that inflationary pressures may be picking up.    &quot;There's a little bit of inflation out there,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;Not a huge amount, but five-tenths is a level you've got to worry about.&quot;    Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago, said the report &quot;raises a cautionary note. The general trend here might be toward accelerating inflation.&quot; Both economists, however, warned against reading too much into a single month's figures.    Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, predicted that inflation in the second half of the year &quot;should level off.&quot; Mr. Volcker made the statement at a news conference following a speech to an accountants group in New York yesterday.    Analysts generally expect energy prices to show only a modest rise, or a decline, this month in response to lower prices recently on international oil markets. Last month, energy prices spurted 1.7% after a 0.1% increase in July.    A small drop in electricity costs in August only partly offset substantially higher prices for motor fuels, natural gas and fuel oil, the department said. Gasoline prices jumped 3.1% last month and have increased 21.4% since the start of the year.    Housing costs rose 0.6% after a 0.2% rise in July. Mr. Ratajczak suggested that the new tax law, which greatly reduced tax breaks for apartment construction, may be starting to push up rents in some parts of the country.    Joel Popkin, president of an economic consulting firm here, disagreed. He said that housing hasn't been a significant source of inflation in the past year and that he doesn't expect the pattern to change significantly.    &quot;I'm not alarmed about today's report as a harbinger of an acceleration of inflation,&quot; he said. Among other factors, he pointed to apparel prices, which are sensitive to import pressures and which were unchanged in August after a 0.6% drop in July. Economists have been watching closely for signs that the dollar's decline in currency markets over the past 2 1/2 years is pushing up domestic prices.    Food prices in August edged up 0.1% after a 0.2% drop in July. Excluding food and energy -- a calculation that many economists contend gives a better view of underlying inflation -- prices rose 0.4% in August following a 0.3% increase in July.    Last month's drop in durable-goods orders largely reflected a decline in the aircraft and parts industry, which had surged in July, the Commerce Department said. A rise in motor vehicles and parts partly offset the decrease in aircraft.    After revision, July orders were unchanged from June. Previously, they were reported as having fallen 0.6%.    The most disturbing aspect about the August decline, economists said, was the 8.4% drop in orders for nondefense capital goods, an indicator of future business investment. These orders rose 6.6% in July. Orders also fell for primary metals, machinery and transportation equipment, which includes aircraft and motor vehicles.    Still, economists generally contend that rising exports are boosting the nation's industrial sector, and many predicted that nondefense capital goods and overall orders will turn up in the months ahead. Among other factors, they noted that total orders have risen since January and that aircraft orders are often volatile. &quot;There is some health in the industrial sector,&quot; Mr. Kahan said.    The August drop brought durable-goods orders to $105.79 billion from $109.17 billion in July. Shipments last month rose 0.7% to $103.77 billion after a 1.4% drop to $103.04 billion in July. The backlog of unfilled orders increased 0.5% to $380.36 billion after a 1.6% rise to $378.34 billion.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal changes.    The Labor Department said that before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index in August rose 0.6% and stood at 342.7% of its 1967 average, up 4.3% from a year earlier.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting Social Security and retirement benefits, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in August after a 0.2% rise in July. Before seasonal adjustment, this index was up 0.5% to 337.4% of its 1967 average and was 4.3% above a year earlier.    The Labor Department also said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers in August jumped 0.9% after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. The rise was the biggest since October 1983, when earnings also rose 0.9%. The last larger rise, 1.3%, was in September of that year. July earnings were revised to show a rise of less than 0.05%. Previously, the department said July earnings fell 0.3%.    The latest figures reflect a 0.8% rise in average hourly earnings and a 0.6% increase in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $316.05 after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, up from $311.81 in July. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings rose to $315.94 from $311.85.    ---   Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for August.                                     % change from                                 July           August                                 1987            1986 All items ...................... 0.5             4.3 Food and beverage .............. 0.1             3.4 Housing ........................ 0.6             3.4 Apparel ........................ 0.0             3.7 Transportation ................. 0.7             6.3 Medical care ................... 0.4             6.5 Entertainment .................. 0.1             3.3 Other .......................... 0.7             5.8   August consumer price indexes for various metropolitanareas (1967 equals 100), together with the percentageincreases from 1986 were: U.S. City Average ............ 342.7             4.3 Chicago ...................... 348.8             5.3 Detroit ...................... 333.5             3.2 Los Angeles .................. 346.7             4.8 New York ..................... 343.7             5.5 Philadelphia ................. 342.2             5.9 San Francisco ................ 356.9             3.3 Dallas-Fort Worth ............ 356.0             2.8 Houston ...................... 344.0             3.3 Pittsburgh ................... 341.7             3.5</TEXT></DOC>
