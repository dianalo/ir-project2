A molybdenum stud with 10 mm diameter is placed on the semispherictop of the inner electrode. The outer electrode has a cage structure.The peak current of DPF is about 2 MA at the charge voltage 40 KV. Thetotal inductance of DPF is about 50 nH. Around the discharge chamberthere are 5 beryllium windows for diagnostics. At 90 degree directionwith respect to electrode axis is placed a X-ray pinhole camera, pinholediameter=0.5 mm. The pictures show a strong exposed contour at the Molybdenumstud. The time integrated X-ray energy spectra in the range 5.0-6.74keV are measured with 8 pairs of Ross-filters (Ta-Sn, Sn-Cd, Ag-Mo, Mo-Ge,Ge-Zn, Zn-Ni, Ni-Fe, Fe-Ti). The energy spectra reveal that there arequite strong radiations of Cu Ka and hard X-ray (photon energy andgt; 20 keV).The yield of the harder part of X-rays is over 40% total X-ray yieldof DPF. This fact is coincident with the result of pinhole camera picturesthe harder X-rays are likely emitted from the anode area.</TEXT></DOC>
