La Fondiaria is 49.9% controlled by INIZIATIVA ME.T.A., the services holding company in the Ferruzzi-Montedison group.    GPG PLC, a British financial-services concern, said it intends to sell its 19.6% stake in GPA GROUP LTD., an aviation financial-services firm, as part of its efforts to concentrate on core operations. It also postponed plans to spin off its Guinness Mahon Holdings Ltd. unit, because of an unfavorable tax decision by the government concerning the move. The tax decision is being appealed.    BAYERISCHE MOTORENWERKE AG, the West German auto maker, said parent-company net income rose 11% in 1987, to 375 million marks ($223.5 million) from 337.5 million marks in 1986. It didn't provide further details. Analysts have estimated that BMW's group profit rose sharply last year because of the success of its new series of luxury models. BMW fell 4.5 marks ($2.68), to 505 marks ($301), on Frankfurt's stock exchange yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
