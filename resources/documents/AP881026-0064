In a communique issued by his office Monday night, Benjedid saidthe ruling party, the National Liberation Front, would become moredemocratic and party officials would be made more accountable to therank and file.   The communique said the party had to ``listen more atentively tothe people to understand their concerns''   The unrest, spurred by Algeria's economic crisis, began withdemonstrators protesting food shortages and rising prices.   The party, which has ruled the country since independence fromFrance in 1962, was already unpopular and has been silent since thedisturbances, which left 159 people dead and 154 injured, accordingto official figures.   Unofficial estimates at the time put the number of dead at 400 ormore.   The communique said, ``a multi-system cannot be established withgroups who seek power and privileges under the facade of democracy.''   However, the communique said, rejuvenation of the ruling partydoes not exclude the possibility that eventually there could be apluralistic system.   It said there will be elections to most party posts andnon-members could run for election to popular assemblies.   The measures are to be put before a party congress in Decemberand then to a referendum next year.   In another referendum next week, Algerians will vote on a plan tomake the prime minister answerable to the National Assembly.</TEXT></DOC>
