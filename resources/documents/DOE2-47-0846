A physician was retained on a part-time basis,and the company employed a full-time nurse. Preemployement physical examinationsincluding pulmonary function tests were given to employees. Detectortubes were used to determine trichloroethylene; concentrations rarelyexceeded 100 parts per million (ppm). Personal protection included safetyglasses, rubber clothing, barrier creams, and partial payment for safetyshoes. Trichloroethylene concentrations ranged from 53.4 to 77.5 ppmwith an OSHA standard of 100 ppm. Polychlorinated biphenyls ranged from0.17 to 1.26 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m{sup 3}) with an OSHA standardof 1mg/m{sup 3}. The authors conclude that the standard for polychlorinatedbiphenyls may not be adequate to protect worker health. Recommendationsare given.</TEXT></DOC>
