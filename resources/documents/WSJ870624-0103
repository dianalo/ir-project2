The moves follow similar announcements by a growing number of banking concerns and reflect interest-payment moratoriums and debt reschedulings by several nations.    First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, said it is increasing such reserves by $160 million, which will result in a second-quarter loss of about $105 million. Signet Banking Corp., Richmond, Va., said its addition of $75 million to total loan-loss reserves will result in a loss of $38 million to $42 million for the quarter. Detroit-based Comerica Inc. said that it increased its total reserves against loan losses by $36 million, but will nonetheless post profit for the quarter.    First Bank System, which ranks itself as the 15th-largest bank holding company in the U.S., said the increase in its reserves will result in a loss of about $48 million for the first six months of 1987. It said it expects earnings of about $70 million to $85 million for the full year.    In the second quarter of 1986, the company earned $49.6 million, or 84 cents a share, and in the six months it earned $96.2 million, or $1.64 a share. For all of 1986, it had net of $202.9 million, or $3.42 a share.    The company said it expects reserves for loan losses at June 30 to be about $513 million, or 3.7% of total loans. First Bank said that as a result of the addition to reserves, its reserve related to less developed countries totals $205 million, or about 50% of its loans to these countries.    First Bank said its primary capital ratio won't change significantly because of the addition and is expected to be 7.1% of total assets at the end of the second quarter, well above regulatory guidelines. It said net income in the future will be bolstered by tax benefits related to the increase in reserves.    Signet said that for the first half, it foresees a loss of $16 million to $20 million, compared with net of $40.1 million, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier. In the 1986 second quarter, Signet had net of $21.2 million, or 87 cents a share.    The additional reserves will bring Signet's allowance for loan-loss reserves to about $157 million, or 2.5% of its total loans.    Comerica said that although it would post profit for the quarter, the increase in its loan-loss reserve, to $112 million, or about 1.9% of all loans, would have the effect of reducing per-share net about $2. In the year-ago quarter, it had profit of $13.7 million, or $1.21 a share. Of the total reserve, $42 million will be allocated for the company's $167 million loans to Latin America, where Comerica has loans to Mexico and Venezuela.    The company said it expects to report &quot;solid profits&quot; for the full year, but didn't elaborate.    Donald R. Mandich, chairman, said, &quot;This action was taken to meet the emerging industry norm for a 25% reserve against Latin American loans.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
