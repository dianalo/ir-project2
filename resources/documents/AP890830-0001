Earlier, sources had said that aid figure could hit $300 million,and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft indicated Tuesday thatthe figure would be even higher than that.   When asked about the reported $300 million figure for the Andeancountries, Scowcroft said, ``That figure, I think you can assume,has already been increased by the fact that we have given Colombia$65 million'' to help it fight the ``total war'' declared by thedrug traffickers there.   However, the $65 million is coming out of a discretionary fundavailable for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The strategy coversfiscal 1990.   Scowcroft had not intended to add the $65 million onto nextyear's budget, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   President Bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug warTuesday at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to discuss thestrategy, but sources said Wednesday that the focus of the meetingwas Colombia, not the strategy, and that no specific decisions weremade on changing plans for future aid to that country.   ``The fundamental issues of the strategy, Kennebunkport did notchange,'' one of the sources said, noting that the final strategyhad gone to the printer before the meeting took place. The sourcedeclined to be named publicly.   Colombia has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers sinceColombian President Virgilio Barco imposed emergency regulations 1{weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions ofalleged drug traffickers to the United States for trial.   Last Friday, Bush announced the United States would give Colombia$65 million in military equipment such as helicopters, in additionto some $2.5 million for protection for the Colombian judiciary thathad been promised previously. Congress last year set aside $5million for such protection. Colombian Justice Minister Monica deGreiff asked Tuesday for $19 million in aid for judicial protection.   Mrs. de Greiff met for about 40 minutes Wednesday with William J.Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy whodeveloped the draft strategy, said Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton.   ``She expressed appreciation for what the United States was doingand they agreed this was not a problem that was going to be solvedquickly,'' Hamilton said. ``She said that the Colombian governmentwas in it for the long haul and that she certainly hoped the UnitedStates would continue its support.''   Hamilton would not comment on the report that the strategy calledfor a total of some $250 million to $260 million for Colombia, Peruand Bolivia.   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Senate JudiciaryCommittee, on Wednesday proposed a plan to create ``debt-for-drugs''swaps to help reduce coca cultivation.   The plan calls for trading debt relief to governments incoca-producing nations in exchange for their commitments to fundspecific crop substitution and coca eradication programs. Peru andBolivia are the chief coca-growing countries, while Colombia is themain cocaine trafficking country, exporting about 80 percent of theworld's cocaine.   The drug strategy, meanwhile, will urge states to impose toughlaws against drug users, but won't threaten to withhold highwayfunds from those states that fail to do so, as the draft strategyhad proposed, an administration source said Wednesday.   In addition, a proposed $25 million National Drug IntelligenceCenter, to be run jointly by the Drug Enforcement Administration andthe FBI, was eliminated from the strategy due to a last-minute bidby the Treasury Department to develop a money-launderingintelligence center and combine all the elements, the source said.The Justice Department objected to the sudden change of plans.   The New York Times, quoting White House sources in its Thursdayeditions, reported that the plan will focus on arrestingmiddle-level figures like pilots, couriers and money handlers.Although the government has been trying for years to identify andarrest middle-level workers, it has not concentrated resources inthis area, the Times said.   The officials said the effort would be a major change from thecurrent emphasis on going after the leaders of international drugorganizations, by trying to seize drugs at the border and byeradicating coca leaf cultivation.   However, most of the elements included in the draft strategy _the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic,the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the needfor massively increased aid to the Andean countries _ remain thesame as proposed originally by Bennett, the source said.   In Kennebunkport on Wednesday, the vacation White House pressoffice announced that a new program allowing judges to strip studentloans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts Friday.   The vacationing President Bush sent Congress a report onWednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state andfederal courts.   Those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be deniedfederal grants, student loans, contracts, and professional andcommercial licenses, but not welfare, disability or Social Securitybenefits.   The decision to deny any or all of an individual's benefits restssolely with the sentencing judge, except for those convicted of athird drug trafficking offense. For them, permanent denial of thebenefits is mandatory.   The penalties can be applied to convictions occurring afterFriday for offenses occurring on or after Nov. 18, 1988.   Next Tuesday, Bush will go on radio and television to describehis new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penaltiesfor individual users.</TEXT></DOC>
