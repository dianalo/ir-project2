though it still may not beenough to get the fledgling software genre off the ground.andM;Unlike competitive office-automation and group-productivity software,Rhapsody's work-flow automation capabilities go beyond integrating existingapplications -- such as E-mail, database management and spreadsheet analysis--to effectively automate office and business procedures typically outsidethe realm of computer systems.andM;Based on Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Windows-based NewWave environment, Rhapsodycombines an intuitive user interface, simple but powerful programming tools,and integrated project-tracking and reporting capabilities into a paradigm ofhow information is created, collected, distributed and used in many largefirms.andM;Yet Rhapsody's cost and dependency on ATandamp;T systems will be prohibitive formost potential buyers (see story, Page 18).andM;And, like its competitors in the work-group software arena, Rhapsody facescorporate cultural barriers to acceptance.andP;  (See related story, Page 1.)andO;Today's office workers may not be ready to have their efforts &quot;orchestrated&quot;by a computer network, nor can Rhapsody -- in the absence of the mythicalpaperless office -- accommodate all forms of information needed for manybusiness procedures.andM;Despite those obstacles, however, Rhapsody represents the state of the art ingroup-productivity software.andM;Rhapsody makes the most of NewWave's &quot;drag-and-drop&quot; capabilities thatinsulate users from the complexities of applications and networks.andM;A user merely drags a document icon to the printer or fax icon on theRhapsody desktop to produce hard copy or send a fax.andP;  Rhapsody's DesktopController automatically launches the appropriate application, creates aprinter or fax-ready file and prints or transmits the document.andM;Building a Rhapsody work flow -- essentially an electronic assembly line fordistributing information and making decisions -- is straightforward, usingthe software's powerful scripting language.andP;  Knowledge of programmingconcepts is a must, but specific coding skill is not.andM;Using the English-like script language, developers can create work-flowprograms that use familiar Windows conventions such as pop-up windows, radiobuttons and scroll bars.andP;  Once written, a work-flow program can prompt usersfor input or to take specific actions; populate template documents withspecified or user-supplied data; deliver those documents to users' desktopswith a flashing &quot;Work To Do&quot; icon and an audio flouris; and automaticallyschedule meetings and update users' appointment books, just to name a fewpossibilities.andM;PC Week Labs used Rhapsody's &quot;Meeting Manager&quot; function to set up ateleconference over internal and outside phone lines, a task that isespecially foolproof if all participants' phone numbers are stored in thenetwork database.andP;  Rhapsody dialed each phone line and connected them viaATandamp;T's &quot;Alliance&quot; service, searched the specified users' appointment booksfor an open time, prompted the users for their scheduling preferences andscheduled the meeting according to the responses.andM;Every element visible on the Rhapsody desktop -- documents, desktop tools andnetwork applications, as well as users' personal resources -- can becontrolled by a work-flow program, as can the Informix database runningbehind the scenes, which holds all of the work-flow information together.andO;(The Informix database runs on the Unix-based Rhapsody server, which connectsDOS-based PCs running ATandamp;T's StarLAN networking software.)andM;Because all steps in a work flow are orchestrated by the program, trackingthe progress of a project is an inherent function.andP;  Automatic generation ofprogress reports can easily be built into a work-flow program and can helpidentify organizational bottlenecks.andM;This level of automation carries a double-edged sword.andP;  Rhapsody's complexityrequires a great deal of up-front planning to effectively automate a givenprocedure, which offers the benefit of forcing together specific businessneeds with the technology implemented to support it.andP;  Yet many organizationsmay find the shared responsibility for creating and maintaining the workflows -- among end-user departments, network administrators and applicationsdevelopers --awkward at times.andM;Overlapping responsibility for tasks such as setting up users on the network,organizing them into work groups and assigning them responsibilities within awork flow can hamper the development process, yet it should also keep theburden of system management from falling into the lap of a single individual.andM;Rhapsody's ease of use and programming is not without its cost in resourcesand performance.andP;  PC Week Labs tested Rhapsody with all-ATandamp;T hardware: a386/33 server with a 300M-byte hard drive and 16M bytes of RAM, and three386SX workstations with 4M bytes of RAM -- ample configurations by today'sstandards, but less than impressive performers in the execution of Rhapsodywork flows.andM;Another sacrifice Rhapsody makes to ease of programming is its lack of moreprofessional programming features and the departure from traditionalprogramming nomenclature in its documentation.andP;  Professional programmers willfind the programming interface lacking and the documentation difficult todecipher.andM;ATandamp;T can be reached at (800) 247-1212.andM;ATandamp;T is marketing Rhapsody as a &quot;complete business orchestration solution,&quot;which the company delivers to the customer's doorstep fully installed andtested.andM;Although work-flow automation may be a concept whose time has come, thispackage errs on the side of delivering too much.andP;  There are few options forthe buyer, and, at the price of $4,490 per user for the software alone, fewcompanies are likely to see a short-term productivity gain large enough tojustify this kind of investment.andM;Equally important and potentially daunting, buyers who want a Rhapsody systemtoday must be prepared to invest in ATandamp;T -- lock, stock and barrel.andM;Rhapsody requires an ATandamp;T Unix System V Release 3.2.2 server, ATandamp;T's StarLANnetworking software and the ATandamp;T StarMail E-mail system, among other things.andO;ATandamp;T officials said the company is porting Rhapsody to other networkingoperating systems and it is possible to &quot;encapsulate&quot; third-party E-mailsystems to work with Rhapsody.andM;For now, however, users of Novell Inc.'s NetWare and companies with largecc:Mail networks, for example, will have to either wait or scrap a large partof their existing investment.andM;Cost alone may be enough to deter many would-be Rhapsody users.andP;  ATandamp;T'spreferred packaging is a complete system, including server, network andindividual PC hardware.andP;  ATandamp;T determines pricing individually for eachcustomer, based on the number of network nodes and software requirements.andP;  A20-user system with a 386-33 server, 386SX client workstations, all networkhardware and software costs $216,795.andP;  The software alone totals $89,795, at$4,490 per user.andP;  A complete 50-user system costs $328,601 with hardware, or$149,655 for the software only.andM;Those prices include a choice of PC applications from a handful, includingLotus Development Corp.'s Lotus 1-2-3 2.2, WordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect5.1, and Microsoft Corp.'s Excel 2.1 and Word for Windows 1.0.andM;For those minicomputerlike prices, the system is fully installed andconfigured on-site by ATandamp;T technicians, and buyers receive some basic user,developer and administrator training.andP;  Yet recommended extras carry separateprice tags, such as $2,500 for a week-long developer's training course.andP;  --andO;B.D.andM;-- Steps: the individual stages of a work-flow program, involving a useraction or one of four different program action types.andM;-- Role action: a step within a program that calls for a response to a&quot;Yes/No&quot; question, cuing the user to perform an action.andP;  If necessary, itinvokes the necessary tool to accomplish the step.andM;-- Script action: the launch of a program, or script, that contains programcommands, variables or conditional branches.andM;-- Document action: a function that handles variable documents; capable ofcreating, editing or merging many documents to build a final version forusers.andM;-- Work-flow action: the launch of a secondary work flow within the onecurrently running.andM;-- Agent: a user or program on the network, which is capable of fulfillingspecific responsibilities or roles within a specific work-flow task.andM;-- Cards: one of two types of visual forms displaying primary, high-levelinformation from the Rhapsody database, such as name, place or event.andP;  Userscan have shared access to cards.andM;-- Forms: one of two types of visual forms displaying secondary databaseinformation.andP;  Forms can show a summary or indexed listing of informationentered into a form, or standard editable fields.andP;  Forms are attached tocards.andM;-- Scripts: the most sophisticated element of a work-flow program, writtenwith a small number of Informix 4GL-derived commands.andM;-- Variable documents: electronic paper work associated with a work-flowtask.andP;  These documents may be created in any supported software program andused as templates containing variables.andP;  The variables can be filled directlyby users, or automatically populated with data obtained from work-flowqueries or calculated by a script.andM;-- Work group: a specific group of users, organized by department or area ofresponsibility.andP;
