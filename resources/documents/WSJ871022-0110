But the INS rebuffed pressure to establish a national, blanket policy for spouses that would keep hundreds of thousands of immigrant families together, and which was considered a way to accelerate the number of amnesty applicants.    The action was a victory for advocates of restrictive immigration policies.    INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson characterized the debate as a &quot;family fairness&quot; issue, rather than a question of &quot;family unity.&quot; At a congressional subcommittee hearing, he said that families had been split apart when one member chose to leave &quot;the home country to seek an illegal life in the United States.&quot;    Under the delicate compromises of the nation's Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, amnesty is granted to illegal immigrants who can prove they have lived in the U.S. since Jan. 1, 1982.    However, in many immigrant families from Latin America, a husband will qualify for legalization under the new law while his wife and children will not because they arrived in the U.S. after the deadline. U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants have citizenship by birthright.    As previously reported, the policy clarification had been expected to be announced by Commissioner Nelson. The effect of the clarification was positive for children, but negative for spouses of legal immigrants.    According to the policy statement, unmarried children under 18 who don't qualify for legalization can stay in the U.S. if their parents achieve legal status. For &quot;specific humanitarian reasons,&quot; the INS district directors can continue to defer deportation on a case-by-case basis for spouses who don't qualify for legalization.    Commissioner Nelson reiterated that information on amnesty application forms, which require applicants to list all legal and illegal family members, would be kept confidential. Once a spouse is legalized, he or she can then petition for the legalization of the other, he noted.    But such petitions, under the immigration law's complex system of category and country quotas, are a protracted process for Mexicans, who make up 55% of U.S. illegal immigrants. The wait would be 10 years for the Mexican spouse of a non-citizen, legal U.S. resident. Also hard-hit would be Filipinos, now the largest Asian immigrant group, who face a six-year backlog.    Roger Conner of the Federation for American Immigration Reform said the law &quot;explicitly&quot; provides no derivative status to spouses married to an immigrant who qualifies for amnesty. &quot;Nelson is clearly exceeding his authority by letting the children stay,&quot; Mr. Conner added.    But immigrant advocates said they will now push Congress to adopt a measure that will give spouses who don't qualify for legalization the ability to remain in the U.S. with work authorization. As with the children, the spouse would be granted a quasi-legal status that prevents deportation. &quot;My members are not going to surrender people&quot; to amnesty without a national policy on spouses, said Warren Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.    Nearly six months into the one-year amnesty program, the INS has received applications from more than 865,000 immigrants and the agency projects two million people will be legalized. The INS originally estimated that 1.9 million to 3.9 million immigrants would be eligible for amnesty. </TEXT></DOC>
