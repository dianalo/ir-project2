The negotiations, aimed at resolving a dispute over Pan Am'sdemands for wage cuts and work-rule changes, were scheduled toresume Sunday afternoon, said Alex Calder, a spokesman for theTeamsters' airlines division.   Calder refused to discuss the status of the talks, saying theunion leadership is hesitant to read too much into them.   Earlier Sunday, William Genoese, director of the airlinedivision of Teamsters Local 732, announced that the workers hadoverwhelmingly authorized a strike, although he refused to releasefigures on the vote.   ``These people are fed up,'' he said of the workers. TheTeamsters union contends it has made sufficient concessions to aidthe financially ailing airline.   Pan Am said that in case of a strike, it would maintain serviceby using replacement workers for the union members, who areemployed as reservation clerks, customer service agents and invarious clerical positions.   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said talks resumed at 10:30p.m. Saturday in New York at the request of a federal mediator.   Genoese said that despite the resumption of talks, there was agood chance of a strike. ``They waited too long. They dragged theirfeet,'' he said.   The 12:01 a.m. deadline marked the end of a 30-day cooling-offperiod mandated by the government.   The Transport Workers Union voted Friday not to support aTeamsters' strike, and the financially ailing airline's pilots,flight attendants and flight engineers unions were not expected toback a strike.   Another Pan Am spokesman, Jeff Kriendler, said: ``The company isprepared to negotiate and wants a settlement. But if there is astrike we're fully prepared to operate.''   Replacement workers, including management employees, weretrained and ready to replace strikers, Kriendler said.   Genoese said Thursday that there was enough support for Local732 among other Teamsters locals to cut off the airline's suppliesof fuel, laundry and liquor around the world.   The union represents workers at airports in Boston, Detroit,Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Hawaii,Houston, Washington, New York and the Florida cities of Tampa,Orlando and Miami.   About 2,300 of the workers are employed in New York and another1,300 are in Miami, Goenese said.</TEXT></DOC>
