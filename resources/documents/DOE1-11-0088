The investmentrequired in the new technologies will reshape the work force of mostlaboratories, by providing more and better tools, and by requiring trainingor retraining of significant numbers of personnel. The need for new instrumentationstandards will arise at new levels in the detectors of the future. Thelaboratories must also invest heavily in integrating various computeraided engineering and computer aided design tools into a smoothly functioningsystem. They must also establish a new and different kind of workingrelationship with vendors and suppliers of both basic devices as wellas standard packaged products. This paper discusses three concepts.</TEXT></DOC>
