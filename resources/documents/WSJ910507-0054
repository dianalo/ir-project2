The new company, Trident Energy Inc., also would assume $9million of the operations' debt.</LP><TEXT>   Occidental and the investment firm, Hicks, Muse andamp; Co.,said they would each invest as much as $100 million in ajoint venture that would own Trident. The balance of thepurchase price would be financed with debt that is&quot;off-balance sheet and non-recourse to either party,&quot;Occidental said.   Industry analysts said the deal would allow Occidental toextract cash from the operations while ensuring a continuedsupply of feedstock for the company's petrochemicaloperations. &quot;It's the best of both worlds . . . taking outcash, but winding up with a 50% interest in the operations,&quot;said Eugene Nowak, an oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.   Occidental shares closed at $18.625, up 12.5 cents, in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Theagreement was announced early in the trading session.   The proposed transaction would be the first big asset salein a restructuring program unveiled in January by Ray R.Irani, Occidental's chairman, president and chief executiveofficer. The plan calls for cutting costs and slashingOccidental's debt by $3 billion, or roughly one-third, by theend of next year.   Occidental said proceeds from the Trident transaction,combined with about $68 million from small asset salesalready completed or announced, would be about $500 million.Last month, Occidental sold its 50% interest in an Antwerp,Belgium, gas terminal for about $37.7 million.   Mr. Nowak, the analyst, said the Trident deal putsOccidental &quot;ahead of schedule&quot; on its debt-cutting plan. Thenext big step is likely to be sale of the company's North Seaoil-production operations, which could fetch $1 billion ormore, he said.   Occidental's natural-gas-liquids business is made uplargely of 40 processing plants in Kansas, Louisiana,Oklahoma and Texas, said a company spokeswoman in Tulsa. Thesale wouldn't include a handful of plants in the PermianBasin in the western part of Texas that Occidental said are&quot;an integral part of its exploration and productionoperations.&quot; Last year, Occidental processed about 71,000barrels a day of natural-gas liquids.   Hicks Muse said Occidental's natural-gas-liquidsprocessing operations generate about $150 million in annualcash flow before interest, taxes, depreciation andamortization. The transaction is subject to financing, whichhasn't yet been arranged, said a partner, Thomas O. Hicks. Hesaid he expects the transaction to close in about 90 days.   While most of Occidental's 600 employees will remain, Mr.Hicks said the venture intends to recruit a new chiefexecutive to try to build the venture by processing others'natural-gas liquids.   Hicks Muse, which has investments in life insurance,recently acquired Healthco International Inc., a provider ofdental equipment, and Morningstar Foods Inc., aspecialty-foods company.   ---   Karen Blumenthal in Dallas contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
