Angrist (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD MIN PCS </IN><TEXT>   Copper prices fell in a burst of late-afternoon selling set off by signs that supplies might not tighten as much as expected in the near future.    Copper for December delivery closed at $1.4320 a pound, down 3.10 cents. The spot November contract declined 3.50 cents to $1.50.    The late sell-off also reflected profit-taking after a climb of more than 50% in copper prices since mid-September. William O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said selling started shortly after data on open interest were released around 1:30 p.m. EST. The Commodity Exchange in New York announced that open interest in December copper dropped about 1,000 contracts from the previous day. Open interest is the number of contracts that remain to be settled.    There had been some concern that with open interest in the December contract representing more than 300,000 tons of copper, and with less than 10,000 tons of copper sitting in Comex-approved warehouses, there might be not enough copper available for delivery against the December contract. But Bill Hanlon, vice president for research at the Comex, said the exchange believes there is no longer any danger of such a squeeze.    A squeeze occurs when holders of long positions in a contract demand physical delivery of the commodity, forcing holders of short positions to go into the market and pay a relatively high price to be able to make the delivery. &quot;We had the same open interest and stock situation in the May, July and September contracts, and they all went off the board in an orderly manner,&quot; Mr. Hanlon said. &quot;We have no reason to believe that it won't happen the same way with the December contract.&quot;    The market's tone was steady early in the day despite Southern Peru Copper Corp.'s announcement that it might delay some shipments because of a strike by Peruvian miners. Ben Bowden, vice president for metals management at Essex Group Inc., one of the largest copper users in the U.S., with annual sales exceeding $900 million, shrugged off the news, saying: &quot;We have been living with production problems ever since I have been in this business. It's part of the business.&quot;    Mr. Bowden said he has had no trouble securing copper to operate the company's mills, which produce all types of wire. &quot;All of our mills are operating normally; moreover, I don't know of any mills shutting down for lack of copper,&quot; he said. He conceded the company has been having to pay more for copper, but he insisted that there is no basis for any reports of shortages.    Still, some others who buy and sell copper disagreed with that assessment. David Threlkeld, president of Threlkeld andamp; Co., a dealer in non-ferrous metals in Randolph, Vt., said that consumption is running ahead of production and that the problem won't be solved soon.    &quot;There has been a constant drawdown of copper this year,&quot; he said. &quot;There is only one way to solve the current imbalance, and that is for prices to rise to ration demand.&quot; Mr. Threlkeld acknowledged that his company has a long position in December copper contracts. He didn't elaborate, but other trade sources said Threlkeld's long position is more than 1,000 contracts; a one-cent rise in copper prices on a long position of 1,000 contracts would result in a profit of $250,000, while a one-cent drop would result in a $250,000 loss.    &quot;Copper users and producers both anticipated a recession that never came,&quot; Mr. Threlkeld said, &quot;and thus they cut inventory. We are now suffering the consequences of that.&quot; He said prices in the U.S. will have to rise still further to attract enough copper from abroad to satisfy demand.    A purchasing agent at a major magnet wire plant in the eastern U.S. said his copper suppliers are fulfilling their commitments but said: &quot;If I wanted to buy 1,000 tons of copper tomorrow morning, I would have a great deal of difficulty in doing so.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: There was little follow-through on Wednesday's surge in gold and platinum prices, partly because yesterday was a holiday in Japan. Mr. O'Neill of Elders Futures said &quot;there was simply no activity&quot; in physical trading of precious metals in Europe or New York. Platinum futures rallied early to reach $592 an ounce on the January contract, then slid to settle at $577.70, down 90 cents for the day. Similarly, gold for December deliver reached $427.20 an ounce before finishing at $423.70, down 50 cents. Some traders and analysts noted, however, that it remained well above its previous resistance level of $420. With U.S. unemployment data coming out today and the presidential election next Tuesday, Mr. O'Neill said, there is little incentive for traders to take new positions at this time. Silver also fell yesterday, with the December contract price settling at $6.45 an ounce, down eight cents in light volume.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of most soybean futures contracts slipped amid profit-taking on Wednesday's rally, which was fueled by rumors of heavy Russian buying. Victor Lespinasse a floor broker of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago, said traders were expecting prices to rebound at the open of trading today. Late yesterday, the U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed that the Soviet Union had bought 565,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal and 440,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans. The department also said another 100,000 metric tons of soybean meal was sold to an undisclosed country, which traders speculate is the Soviet Union. The Soviet purchases are in addition to another purchase of 250,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans, which the department confirmed earlier this week. Corn futures prices ended mixed because a rumored Soviet purchase didn't materialize. Earlier this week, some traders were speculating that the Soviet Union is interested in buying as much as two million metric tons of U.S. corn. Wheat futures ended mixed.    COCOA: Cocoa prices fell in relatively heavy trading. December cocoa settled at $1,309 a ton, down $63, after substantial rises the previous two days. There were unconfirmed reports that the Ivory Coast, a major producer, had sold some cocoa. Bert Ruiz, a tropical products specialist at Balfour Maclaine Futures Inc. in New York, quoted one major dealer as saying cocoa appeared to be coming into the market. &quot;It is almost impossible to confirm such rumors, but the dealers have a good feel for market action,&quot; he said. Cocoa has had two pronounced price trends since the summer, he said: a downtrend that lasted from July to early October that took December cocoa to $1,103 and now an uptrend that has brought the market over $1,300. &quot;I was a little bit puzzled by the run-up in prices,&quot; he said, &quot;because there is no shortage of cocoa. But commodity fund managers love trending markets, and I believe that some of them took profits yesterday on their long positions in the market.&quot; He also said some major manufacturers bought cocoa beans yesterday during the sell-off.
