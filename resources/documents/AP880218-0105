This includes $1.3 billion infunding for the Public Health Service.   _Building upon the nation's pre-eminence in basic biomedicalresearch, I seek a 5.1 percent increase for non-AIDS research atthe National Institutes of Health.   Our fight against drug abuse must continue, as well as ourefforts to protect the individual against crime.   _For expanded law enforcement, including efforts targeted atwhite collar crime, organized crime, terrorism and publiccorruption, I propose $4.5 billion _ an increase of 6 percent over1988.   _For drug law enforcement, prevention, and treatment programs, Ipropose $3.9 billion in 1989, a 13 percent increase over the 1988level.   _To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growinginmate population, I would provide $437 million _ more than doublethe $202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988.   Other areas of federal responsibility receive priority fundingin this budget:   _For the Federal Aviation Administration to continue itsmultiyear program to modernize the nation's air traffic controlsystems, I would provide $1.6 billion _ a 44 percent increase overthe level of 1988.   _To improve coordination of federal rural development programsand to redirect funding toward needy rural areas and programrecipients, I propose a rural development initiative to becoordinated by the secretary of agriculture.   _To carry out the joint recommendations of the U.S. and Canadianspecial envoys on acid rain, I recommend total funding of $2.5billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projectsover the period 1988 through 1992.   _I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanupefforts, with an increase in Superfund outlays of some $430 millionin 1989.   _To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) atthe current rate of 50,000 barrels per day, I would provide $334million in 1989. Contingent upon the enactment of legislationauthorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves (NPR), I wouldprovide an additional $477 million to bring the fill rate up to100,000 barrels per day, and an additional $208 million toestablish a separate 10 million barrel defense petroleum inventoryto offset the disposition of the NPR.   _To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expandinformation services provided to taxpayers, I would provide a $241million increase for the Internal Revenue Service. These funds aredesigned to assure smooth implementation of the 1986 tax reforms.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
