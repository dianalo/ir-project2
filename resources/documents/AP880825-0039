Acid rain, which results from certain kinds of man-madepollution, can harm fish, other aquatic life, vegetation, buildingsand monuments.   For the experiment, begun in 1984 and reported in the Britishjournal Nature, Norwegian and Swedish researchers built the roofover a site in southern Norway that had been exposed to acid rain.   Precipitation that fell on the roof was filtered to removeacid-rain components, then distributed beneath the roof bysprinklers.   Analysis showed the runoff beneath the roof began to recovernormal chemistry after the structure was built.   That ``indicates that chemical changes caused by acid depositionare largely reversible,'' the researchers wrote.   The results agree with previous studies from Canada, the UnitedStates and Scotland, they said.   Further studies of soil and runoff will be needed to see if theycan completely recover from acid rain, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
