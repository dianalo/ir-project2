Three steamflood modelsand one steamsoak model were evaluated by comparing their predictionswith field data. Each model was found inadequate and was modified toimprove its ability to history match field data. The modified Jones steamdrivemodel with its empirically determined scaling factors was found to givethe best history match of oil production for the Kern River field. Fieldswith different characteristics will require the adjustment of these scalingfactors to achieve an acceptable history match. The modified Farouq Alisteam drive model gives reasonably good history matches without needfor empirical scaling factors or adjustable parameters. It is thus recommendedfor the prediction of steamdrive oil recovery when field production dataare unavailable. The modified Miller-Leung, gravity override steamfloodmodel, which contains two adjustable parameters, was found to possessthe best overall history matching capabilities and is recommended forthis purpose. The deficiencies of the Gontijo-Aziz steamsoak model whichcontains four adjustable parameters, prompted the development of an improvedanalytical steam stimulation model. The model is applicable to homogeneous,gravity drainage, pressure depleted reservoirs. The model gave an excellenthistory match for oil production and water cut for the Midway Sunsetfield project while employing only one adjustable parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
