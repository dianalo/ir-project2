(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citibank said it will abandon a policythat denied credit cards to some liberal arts majors after studentsat the University of California-Berkeley demanded the bank'srepresentatives be barred from campus.   Bill McGuire, a spokesman for Citibank in New York, said onWednesday the bank was retreating from the policy and that it wouldbe discontinued by the end of June. He admitted the company hadreceived complaints from several universities around the country,but he would not name them.   Although McGuire said in a telephone interview ``using the majorwas a good indicator of future earning potential and of students'ability to pay debt,'' he would not describe how the policy wasapplied.   McGuire said other factors would be used to judge students'credit worthiness, but he would not specify what they are.   A spokesman for the United States Comptroller of the Currency inKansas City, Mo., said Tuesday that the Equal Credit OpportunityAct does not prohibit using a student's academic major in a creditapplication system.   Spokeswoman for American Express and the Bank of America saidthey were surprised by the Citibank policy, since theirorganizations had found that students were good credit risks.   American Express and Bank of America, along with Citibank thelargest credit card issuers, said they do not use academic majorsas part of their credit scoring system for students.   The UC students complained they were denied credit cards becauseof their studies in such areas as English, rhetoric, art historyand Italian. They said the bank's representatives would be barredfrom campus unless there was a change in the policy.   ``This was obvious, senseless discrimination, that in effectsaid students in business or engineering majors are the ones whowill be making all the money and that only they could be trusted,''said Molly Sorkin, 22.   Sorkin, a major in art history major last fall at UC-Berkeley,said Citibank rejected her application for a Visa card last fallbecause of her ``field of study.''   ``What I study says nothing about my responsibility or whetheror not I can pay my bills,'' said Sorkin, who graduated in Decemberand now works in retail sales.   ``It seems like they're trying to promote engineering andbusiness majors. We cannot condone such discrimination in oursociety,'' said Kennedy Yip, turned down by Citibank on Feb. 13because of his rhetoric major.   Yip, 22, received a Visa last year while attending a differentcollege as a mathematics major.   The Citibank policy, apparently part of a credit scoring system,was uncovered last week when a reporter for the independent campusnewspaper, The Daily Californian, asked a campus bank-cardcanvasser how to apply. Citibank representatives set up tablesaround the student union to accept credit applications.   The canvasser, reporter Irene Chang said, advised her to fill inthe credit application by listing business administration orelectrical engineering as her major, instead of English.   Michele Lee, a senator in UC-Berkeley's student government, saidshe was investigating complaints against Citibank as well asagainst a local department store that reportedly also has deniedcredit to students because of their majors. She didn't identify thestore chain.</TEXT></DOC>
