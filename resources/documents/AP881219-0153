Comments by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and Bush'sonetime press secretary Pete Teeley left some confusion over thepurpose for the November 1985 meeting at Bakker's headquarters inCharlotte, N.C.   Fitzwater, who attended the meeting, initially told a White Housepress briefing Monday that it was to seek support for Bush'sforthcoming presidential race. But later he said he had misspokenand that the meeting was not political, but rather was in Bush'scapacity as vice president _ ``a standard meeting of the kind thatwe had hundreds of. The vice president didn't ask for anything orpromise anything.''   Fitzwater, who was Bush's vice presidential press secretary andwill be White House press secretary when Bush takes office inJanuary, made the comments at his daily briefing at the White Housewhere he is currently President Reagan's spokesman.   His account conflicted with that of Teeley, who at the time ofthe Bush-Bakker meeting was working as a marketing consultant forBakker's PTL ministry.   Teeley said Monday that Bush's meeting with Bakker was part of``coalition building'' for the future presidential race and that thevice president met with many evangelical leaders for the samepurpose, including the Rev. Billy Graham, the Rev. Jerry Falwell andthe Rev. Robert Schuler.   ``Those things were done every day. ... It didn't matter whereyou were _ Pittsburgh, Charlotte or Miami _ if you could meet withsome people who were active politically, you tried to sit down andtalk with them,'' Teeley said in telephone interview.   Fitzwater, answering questions at Monday's briefing, initiallyhad said Bush ``was seeking his support for the campaign,absolutely. ... You have hundreds of meetings like that when you'rerunning for president.''   Later Fitzwater said that was not the correct characterization,that the only support Bush sought was for the Reaganadministration's policies.   In March 1987, Bakker stepped down from his PTL ministry, as hissexual involvement with former church secretary Jessica Hahn createdheadlines. At the time Bush met him, there had been no disclosure ofsuch activity by Bakker.   A report Sunday in The Washington Post contained an allegation byformer Bakker bodyguard Don Hardister that Bush and Bakker talkedabout a possible admihistration job for Bakker.   Asked about that report, Fitzwater told reporters, ``I don't knowwhat Bakker thought. There was no talk of jobs or payoffs oranything else. It was a simple meeting as the vice president hadwith hundreds of other people and individuals asking their support... asking his support for various policies and so forth.   ``They talked about their Christian beliefs. They talked aboutthe Robertson campaign. It was just a friendly discussion,''Fitzwater told the briefing.   Bush met with Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, in November 1985,as he was looking ahead to his race for the GOP presidentialnomination. Eventually he defeated Robertson, host of the popular``700 Club'' Christian television show, in the primaries. The Bushforces had been concerned about Robertson's unknown potential topull votes from the religious right.   Besides Bush's own meeting with Bakker, the vice president hadthree close associates whom Bakker hired as consultants: Teeley;Doug Weed, a sometime guest host on the ``700 Club'' who worked as aliaison for Bush's campaign with religious groups; and Dean Burch,former head of the Federal Communications Commission and theRepublican National Committee.   Weed currently works for the Bush presidential transition staffas a liaison with religious groups.   Teeley, who acknowledged earning $120,000 for his PTL work, saidhis work for Bakker pertained to marketing and had no relation toBush or politics.</TEXT></DOC>
