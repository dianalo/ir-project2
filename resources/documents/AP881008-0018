The new agreement, struck Friday by House and Senate conferees,sets a Dec. 31, 1991, deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nineauthorities in New York and New Jersey.   The legislation imposes stiff fines aimed at making the dumpingexorbitantly expensive, and pools the fines to pay for alternatives.   ``The agreement is tough but fair. Clearly the end of oceandumping is in sight,'' said Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., the primeHouse sponsor.   ``This bill is a major step in cleaning up our oceans,'' addedRep. Robert Roe, D-N.J.   The compromise reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passedby the Senate in August and by the House earlier this week.   Senate and House votes on the compromise are expected Wednesday.President Reagan is expected to sign the bill.   Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nineagencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey. Congressclosed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.   Experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumpingof sludge.   The new bill requires dumpers to pay fees of $100 per ton ofsludge beginning on Jan. 1 of next year.   Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 wouldhave to pay penalties in addition to the fees.</TEXT></DOC>
