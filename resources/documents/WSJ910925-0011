Other Japanese personal computer makers such as NEC Corp.are expected to follow suit.</LP><TEXT>   A Toshiba spokesman said his company started shipping some2,000 laptop computers using Thin Film Transistor colorliquid crystal display panels to the U.S. this month.   The exports account for some 10% of the personal computersToshiba has been marketing in the U.S. each month.   Japanese manufacturers suspended U.S. exports ofsophisticated personal computers such as 16-bit and 32-bitlaptops in 1987 when Washington, alleging a violation of abilateral semiconductor agreement, imposed a 100% tariff.   Toshiba decided to resume exports in part because the U.S.government has lifted the surcharge in a new semiconductoraccord that went into effect last August.</TEXT></DOC>
