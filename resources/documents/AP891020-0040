The compromise legislation approved Thursday, which could paythe former internees as much as $1.2 billion over three years, mustnext be passed by both houses of Congress before being sent to theWhite House for consideration by President Bush.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has opposed the payments ongrounds they are too costly. Bush has not made his position known.   The reparations payments are part of an overall $17.3 billionmeasure providing appropriations for the Commerce, State andJustice departments for the 1990 fiscal year which opened Oct. 1.   House negotiators accepted the Senate-passed version of the billmaking the reparations payments an entitlement and guaranteeingthat all of the still-living internees will receive them.   The Senate voted 74-22 on Sept. 29 to waive budget restrictionsand guarantee the reparations payments are made.   The Senate version of the bill, which the conference approved,bars any payments until the beginning of the next fiscal year onOct. 1, 1991.   But it then makes up to $500 million a year available over threeyears until all of the $20,000 reparations payments are made.</TEXT><NOTE>Drug Czar Admits Drugs Problem In Nation's Capital Worsening</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The drug crisis in the nation's capital isgetting worse despite a six-month joint partnership by federal andlocal authorities fighting the problem, says National Drug PolicyCoordinator William J. Bennett.   ``No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capitalis still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' Bennett said at anews conference Thursday. ``We picked a difficult task last April,and I never had any illusions about the challenges that lay beforeus.''   Bennett made his remarks while issuing a six-month ``progressreport'' on a special initiative he generated to help the Districtof Columbia curb its record murder rate and drug-related crime wave.   So far in 1989, 360 persons have been killed in the district, 12short of the all-time annual record set last year. By this time in1988, 270 homicides had been reported in Washington. Police blamedrugs, particularly crack cocaine, for more than 60 percent ofthese deaths.</TEXT><NOTE>Group Says Common Practices Not in Consumers' Interest</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A consumer group is charging that merchantsacross the country are handling personal checks and credit cardtransactions in ways that may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy.   The organization, Bankcard Holders of America, on Thursdayassailed the practice of many merchants requiring customers who payfor purchases with personal checks to provide a major credit cardnumber and expiration date, plus a telephone number. Thisinformation is then written on the check.   ``Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing theirbankcard numbers on personal checks, but these consumers don'trealize the potential danger in doing so,'' the group's director,Elgie Holstein, told a news conference.   He contended that ``mail order fraud and application fraud areincreasingly popular crimes, and placing this information (a card'snumber and expiration date) on a personal check enables a thief tomake purchases or apply for credit in the customer's name.   ``Requiring customers to present a major credit card asidentification, or even noting on the check that the consumer holdsa Visa or MasterCard, can be an appropriate merchant practice,''Holstein said. ``It is dangerous, however, to require credit cardnumbers to be written on checks.''   To help consumers deal with this practice, the organization ismaking available a wallet-sized ``Consumer Action Card'' to presentto merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personalchecks. The wallet card alerts merchants that recording thisinformation encourages fraud and may violate a customer's privacy.</TEXT></DOC>
