Traders said oil prices rose Monday partly on speculation thatOPEC would encourage other oil producers to rein in production.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' pricemonitoring committee, which met over the weekend, said it wouldmeet soon with non-OPEC exporters to consider shared productionrestraints.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery contractfor West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil, jumped $1.01per barrel to close at $17.89, its highest level this year.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heatingoil rose 2.42 cents a gallon to 47.88 cents, and wholesale unleadedgasoline rose 2.18 cents a gallon to 50.95 cents.   Oil market experts debated whether the gain was sustainable.Some believe the jump in prices may be signaling an end to therecent low-price era in the petroleum business.   The sharp run-up had a negative impact on the credit markets,where the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose to8.77 percent from 8.68 percent late Friday.   The stock market edged slightly higher, extending last week'srally despite some resistance from sellers. The Dow Jones averageof 30 industrials rose 5.80 to 2,095.99 on top of last week's102.13-point jump to new closing highs since the crash last fall.
