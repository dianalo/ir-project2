COMPUTATIONALandM;EFFICIENCYandM;Alliant Computer Systems last week introduced the CAMPUS/800, a massivelyparallel processing (MPP) supercomputer with up to 800 standard RISCprocessors.andM;The Alliant CAMPUS/800 is the first system to support both distributed andshared memory, making it easier to program and more efficient for real-worldapplications.andM;Current MPP systems -- such as those from Thinking Machines and Intel SSD --are based exclusively on distributed memory, in which messages must be passedback and forth between large numbers of processors.andP;  This increasesprogramming complexity and severely limits efficient use of processorresources.andP;  However, distributed memory is required to build MPP systemswhich &quot;scale up&quot;  to hundreds of processors.andM;Shared memory, on the other hand, allows processors to easily and rapidlyshare data and coordinate tasks.andP;  This makes programming easier and yieldsgreater application performance to the end user.andP;  The CAMPUS/800 combines theprogramming simplicity and computational efficiency of shared memory with thescalability of distributed memory, resulting in an MPP system that issignificantly more usable than current MPP offerings.andM;In addition, the CAMPUS two-tier memory architecture better matches thenatural structure of most large-scale problems, which typically exhibit bothfine-grain and coarse-grain parallelism.andP;  The CAMPUS architecture uses sharedmemory for fine-grain parallelism and distributed memory for coarse-grainparallelism.andM;&quot;Our experience has shown that a two-level memory architecture is the mostnatural and computationally efficient mechanism for utilizing large numbersof processors in a massively parallel system,&quot;  said Dr.andP;  David Kuck,professor and director of the University of Illinois' Center forSupercomputer Research and Development (CSRD).andP;  &quot;CAMPUS is a naturalextension to the collaborative parallel architecture development at CSRD andAlliant over the past ten years.&quot;andM;Massively parallel systems are used to solve large scale problems whichcannot be effectively handled by traditional supercomputers.andP;  However, MPPsystems have been difficult to use compared to these traditional systems.andP;  Asa result, they have been little more than fast, exotic machines usedprimarily for experiments by computer scientists rather than to solve real-world problems.andM;CAMPUS provides parallel programming tools for productivity, standardthird-party applications for ease-of-use, and a versatile UNIX operatingsystem environment for accessibility.andM;The CAMPUS/800 MPP system provides up to 32 peak GFLOPS of computing powerand 128 Gbytes of memory.andP;  A fully configured CAMPUS/800 system is composedof 32 supercomputer ClusterNodes, each consisting of a &quot;cluster&quot;  of 25 Intel64-bit i860 RISC processors and 4 Gbytes of high-speed shared memory.andO;ClusterNodes communicate over a 2.56 Gbyte/s High-speed Memory Interconnect(HMI).andM;Each ClusterNode is based on the proven FX/2800 supercomputer, enhanced viahardware and software for high- performance MPP operation.andP;  CAMPUS can beused as a single large MPP system for extremely large problems or as multipleautonomous supercomputers for individual departments.andM;Ease-of-programming is provided by a sophisticated set of development tools,including Alliant's automatic parallel compilers and libraries -- based onnearly 10 years of experience in producing parallel processing software --and the high-level EXPRESS environment from ParaSoft Corporation (Pasadena,CA).andM;Over 100 third-party applications are available to run on the parallelClusterNode, having previously been developed and delivered on the existingFX/2800 supercomputer.andP;  This allows users to be productive immediately andthen gradually move applications to larger numbers of processors over time.andO;By comparison, very few off-the-shelf applications are available forcompetitive systems because of the extensive modifications and effortrequired by experts.andM;VERSATILE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CAMPUS is the first MPP system with afull-function UNIX operating system executing on each node of the MPP systemitself.andP;  Other MPP vendors rely on a separate workstation or VAX &quot;front-end&quot;to execute the operating system and provide services such as time-sharingaccess, UNIX file I/O, network connectivity and software developmentfacilities.andM;This limits the number of simultaneous users, since access to the system islimited by the power of the front-end, and increases the overall cost of thesystem.andP;  In contrast, the CAMPUS system supports simultaneous execution ofcomputational tasks with UNIX file I/O, network activity and development oneach of the ClusterNodes, thus providing a significantly more versatile androbust operating environment and supporting a greater numbers of users.andM;AVAILABILITY andamp; PRICING Production availability of CAMPUS/800 systems isscheduled for Q2 1992.andM;The system is priced at $2.5M for a typical configuration with 100processors.andP;  An 800-processor CAMPUS system is priced at $16M.andM;Alliant Computer Systems Corporation is the leading manufacturer ofstandards-based parallel supercomputers.andP;  More than 650 systems have beeninstalled by customers around the world to enable scientists and engineers toquickly solve complex problems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
