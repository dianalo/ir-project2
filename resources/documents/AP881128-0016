(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA began the countdown early Mondayfor launching the space shuttle Atlantis on Thursday with fiveastronauts and an intelligence-gathering satellite.   The clock begin ticking at 12:01 a.m. EST as test director JerryCrute issued the traditional ``call to stations'' that summoned morethan 100 controllers to their computer consoles in the launchcontrol center four miles from the launch pad.   ``We're pressing on; the countdown has started,'' said GeorgeDiller, a NASA spokesman.   The call also was a signal for workers at the pad to beginservicing the main engines and removing work platforms from aroundthe base of the spaceship.   Because the mission is classified, the Defense Department andNASA are disclosing few details of the flight. A brief statement wasissued Sunday describing the preparations completed earlier in theday with the inspection and closure of the engine compartment.   U.S. officials are mum on the length of the flight and what theastronauts will be doing in orbit, but the official Soviet newsagency Tass said Sunday the mission's main task is to put a newgeneration reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse, intonear-Earth orbit.   ``The satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of theSoviet Union with the help of updated radar,'' Tass said in a reportfrom Moscow.   ``The Pentagon plans to deploy in the next few years four othersimilar spy satellites which will play the role of an `eye' for thenew strategic bomber B-2, known as stealth,'' the Soviet agency said.   As for the timing of the launch Thursday, reliable sources havesaid that it should take place about 7 a.m. EST if weather and otherconditions are adequate. But officials will say only that launch isscheduled to occur sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. They saythey will make the time public when the clock reaches the 9-minutemark.   A preliminary weather forecast for Thursday was not favorable,calling for overcast sky, brisk winds and a chance of showers.   Once Atlantis reaches space, NASA plans only two publicannouncements. The first, four hours after launch, will reportbriefly on the condition of the spaceship. The second will be a24-hour advance notice on when the astronauts will land at EdwardsAir Force Base in California.   The silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops.   The Pentagon contends the secrecy makes it more difficult forSoviet satellites and spy ships prowling off Cape Canaveral tomonitor the flight and learn its purpose.   Critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because theSoviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly alreadyknow a great deal about the mission and that once Atlantis'satellite is in its own orbit, the Soviets will be able to track itprecisely and know what it is doing.   The satellite reportedly will gather extremely sharp radar imagesof military targets as it follows a path that will carry it over 80percent of the Soviet Union.   The five military astronauts who will fly the mission arescheduled to arrive here Monday from their training base in Houstonto make final preparations for launch. They are Navy Cmdr. Robert L.Gibson, the commander; Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the pilot;and Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L.Ross and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.   The flight will be the 27th for the space shuttle, the thirddedicated totally to the military and the second since theChallenger explosion that killed seven crew members in January 1986.Following the accident, NASA held up flights for 32 months whilemanagement and hardware changes were made.   Discovery and a five-man crew returned the shuttle to space witha flight that began Sept. 29.</TEXT></DOC>
