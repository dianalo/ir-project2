The agency also said Wednesday that it was ordering a temporaryhalt to sales of strychnine pesticide products, which are usedmainly against field rodents.   The agency said it will cancel the federal pesticide license ofthe only manufacturer of sodium fluoroacetate, known as ``Compound1080,'' which is put into baited sheep collars. The producer, TullChemical Co. of Oxford, Ala., failed to provide data requested byEPA, agency spokesman Al Heier said.   The federal Agriculture Department, the Wyoming AgricultureDepartment, the Montana Livestock Department and Ranchers SupplyCo. of Alpine, Texas, have licenses to use and sell the product.All will be permitted to continue distributing and using them, butthey will have to submit safety data on their use to EPA.   Agency spokesman Al Heier said the collar's users ``are going tohave to work like heck to get an alternate supply of the chemical.''   Heier said another manufacturer could attempt to win a licenseby providing the information the EPA wants.   EPA also said it was suspending all licenses for use of Compound1080 against rodents, in which it is dispersed in pellets.   The Nixon administration banned the use of Compound 1080 in1972, after its widespread use in baited carcasses by ranchers ledconservationists to protest that it was killing eagles and otherwildlife.   But pressure from ranchers prompted EPA to reverse itself in1985 and permit Compound 1080 to be used in closed collars onsheep. Coyotes puncture the collar and ingest fatal doses when theyseize sheep by the neck.   The agency also announced Wednesday that it was temporarilysuspending all licenses for sale of strychnine products. At thesame time, the agency said it had temporarily canceled licenses, amore serious action, for sale and above-ground use of allpesticides containing strychnine. This temporary cancelation iseffective immediately.   The suspension of strychnine products would halt the sale, butnot the use, of the pesticide. The temporary cancellation oflicenses for use of above-ground strychnine halts that product'suse, but allows the pesticide to be used below ground.   The squirrels can devastate otherwise productive land, and theonly alternative to strychnine, sometimes applied from the air, ismanual application of poisonous phosgene gas in below-groundburrows.   Most strychnine licenses are held by state and local governmentsin the West and the U.S. Agriculture Department.   The strychnine temporary cancellation complies with the order ofa federal court in Minnesota issued in April requiring the agencyto halt above-ground use while it developed means to protectnon-target species. The agency has appealed the order but has losta request for a stay.   The suspensions are the result of failure of state and localgovernments to provide EPA with safety data, Heier said.   Except for the strychnine temporary cancellation, all theactions are effective in 30 days unless license holders requesthearings. If those hearings are held, the products may still beused.</TEXT></DOC>
