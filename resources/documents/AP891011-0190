The United States notified Italy earlier this month thatOlivetti, one of Europe's largest computer and office equipmentcompanies, was suspected of violating bans on the transfer ofsophisticated technology to the communist bloc, said ItalianForeign Minister Gianni De Michelis.   ``We are now investigating in Rome,'' De Michelis said, addingthat the results of the investigation would be conveyed at an Oct.22 meeting in the Italian capital with Assistant Secretary of StateReginald Bartholomew.   President Francesco Cossiga told Bush that the investigationinto the Olivetti allegations was ``being pursued in ... a highlycooperative manner,'' Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitztold reporters.   U.S. and Italian officials declined to discuss the suspectedsale publicly, citing the sensitive nature of the information.   ``This is essentially an intelligence source,'' said oneofficial.   Another American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Olivetti was suspected of having sold the Soviets machinetools and computer software that was used to manufacture componentsfor a highly sophisticated jetfighter known as the Yak-41. Theplane is capable of taking off vertically.   Another official said the sales had been going on for severalyears, and involved ``less than $50 million.''   The Milan newspaper Corriere Della Sera said in a report on thematter that unspecified ``military sources'' confirmed thatOlivetti sales of systems and software enabled the plane to beproduced.   In Rome, Premier Giulio Andreotti met for about an hourWednesday with Olivetti chairman Carlo De Benedetti, one of themost powerful businessmen in Europe. Neither made any statements atthe end of the meeting.   Italy is one of 17 members of the Paris-based CoordinatingCommittee on Multilateral Export Controls, which regulates the saleof high technology to communist countries. Problems have arisenoften in recent years regarding sales of so-called ``dual use''technology, which can be converted to manufacture weapons.   The most well-known case of such a violation involved the saleto the Soviets of computerized milling equipment by Toshiba ofJapan and the Norwegian state-owned Kongsberg conglomerate. Theequipment was used by the Soviets to make silent propellers forsubmarines, making them harder for the West to detect.   As a result, Congress passed legislation last year empoweringthe administration to impose sanctions, including import bans,against companies found in violation of COCOM.   De Michelis said the main thrust of the Cossiga talks with Bushwas prospects for peace in the Middle East, the upcoming electionsin Nicaragua and reforms in Eastern Europe.   Cossiga, speaking on the White House lawn before his meetingwith Bush, urged more financial assistance to help those politicalchanges succeed.   ``I'm thinking in particular of the great Polish nation that iscurrently in the throes serious difficulty in its courageousattempt to work its renewal and which needs more substantial aidfrom us,'' he said.   Seitz told reporters that Bush and Cossiga ``waxed philosophicalabout East-West issues and the importance of defense throughoutthis period of change in Europe.''   Later at a state dinner, the American president lauded thefriendship between Italy and the United States, saying the tieshave ``never been stronger'' and paying tribute to the ``newItaly'' as a ``great and growing economic power, one of the world'sforemost democracies, a strong and valued ally and a partner in thecommunity of free nations.''   Cossiga said western nations were under an obligation toencourage reform in the Eastern Bloc countries, and members of theEuropean Common Market ``intend to redouble their efforts toestablish a climate of ever greater mutual confidence and torestore increasingly close economic cultural and human relationsthroughout the European continent.''</TEXT></DOC>
