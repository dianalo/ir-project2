FDA proposed these amendmentsto reflect changes in the infant formula provisions of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) contained in the Drug Enforcement Educationand Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570) (the 1986 amendments).Interested persons were given until October 13, 1987, to comment on theproposal. FDA received comments from a trade association and a consumergroup in support of the proposal. Both organizations suggested minor modificationsto the proposed rule. The consumer group also commented on certain historicalbackground information in the proposal's preamble. The agency is not respondingto these comments on the historical background because they do not havea direct bearing on the proposed rule.FDA initially proposed codifying the infant formula regulations in Part7_Enforcement Policies (21 CFR Part 7), consisting of andSection;andSection;7.68 to 7.76. The agency has determined that because they specificallygovern recalls of infant formulas and, because, in the case of a hazardto health, such recalls are mandatory, these regulations are more appropriatelycodified in Part 107_Infant Formula (21 CFR Part 107), consisting of andSection;andSection;107.200 to 107.280. The section headings have remained essentially thesame. A summary of the pertinent comments and the agency's responses areas follows:1. One comment requested that FDA revise the language in andSection; 107.230(d)(21 CFR 107.230(d)) to require a 15-day limit on the time for displayinga notice of recall at retail establishments. (Section 107.230(d) was originallyproposed as andSection; 7.71(d) (21 CFR 7.71(d).) In support of this suggestion,the comment stated that a uniform and definite posting period would beadvantageous because it would eliminate the need for two communicationsfrom the manufacturer to the retailer, and that two communications couldcreate an opportunity for confusion.Another comment opposed limiting the time period for the display of thisnotice and stated that the required posting should be for a substantiallylonger period of time, although the comment did not suggest a specificalternative. In support of its opposition to the 15-day period, this commentstated that parents often buy infant formula in large quantities and, therefore,could miss a recall notice displayed for only a 15-day period.The agency does not agree with either comment. FDA's experience is thateach recall is unique; some recalls are completed before 15 days and othersrequire a substantially longer time to complete. (FDA's current policyis that a recall of an infant formula is complete when the recalling firmhas actually impounded all outstanding product that could reasonably beexpected to be recovered.)FDA believes that requiring an infant formula recall notice to be postedat a retail establishment after completion of the recall could cause confusionand concern to consumers and could have an unnecessary adverse economicimpact on the industry and the recalling firm, as well as consumers, withoutachieving any public health benefit. Likewise, FDA believes that the publichealth would not be adequately protected by permitting such recall noticesto be removed before completion of the recall. For these reasons, the agencyhas concluded that manufacturers should be required to request that recallnotices be posted at retail establishments for the duration of the recall.Accordingly, andSection; 107.230(d) remains as originally proposed.2. One comment also suggested amending proposed andSection; 107.240(a) tomake it clear that inconsequential or technical violations of the act,such as a minor typographical error on a label or insignificant deviationsin current good manufacturing practices, need not be reported to FDA. (Section107.240(a) was originally proposed as andSection; 7.72(a) (21 CFR 7.72(a).)In support, this comment cited statements by the amendments' cosponsors,Senators Hatch and Metzenbaum, made at the time the legislation was enacted.Another comment opposed this clarification and stated that FDA should bemade aware of all deviations whether or not recall of a product results.The first comment also suggested a change in the format of andSection; 107.240(a)to create two paragraphs in order to clarify that there are two separateinstances in which notification to FDA is required.The agency does not believe that the requested modification in the languageof andSection; 107.240(a) is warranted. The plain language of the notificationprovision of the 1986 amendments (section 412(e)(1) of the act, 21 U.S.C.350a(e)(1) requires that a manufacturer with the requisite knowledge notifyFDA of any infant formula that may not provide the required nutrients orthat may otherwise be adulterated or misbranded; no exceptions from suchnotification for so-called technical violations are set forth in the statute.This plain language in the statute is controlling, in the absence of aclearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Turkette, </T3>452 U.S. 576, 580 (1981).In this case, the legislative history of the amendments, when read as awhole, expresses no clear intention by Congress to limit the types of adulterationor misbranding for which an infant formula manufacturer is required tonotify FDA. In fact, Senator Hatch's complete remarks show that he wasprincipally concerned about limiting the instances in which recalls, notnotification to FDA, would be required. (132 Cong. Rec. S14047 (daily ed.September 27, 1986).) The final rule is consistent with both the plainlanguage of the statute and the amendments' legislative history in thatFDA will require an infant formula manufacturer to conduct a recall onlywhen the infant formula presents a risk to human health.Although FDA is declining at this time to limit by regulation the instancesof adulteration and misbranding that must be reported to FDA pursuant toandSection; 107.240(a), the agency intends to monitor the notifications madeto the agency under andSection; 107.240(a) to determine whether any limitationsshould be established in the future, either by guideline or further regulation.In addition, FDA notes that even if a manufacturer elects to remove fromthe marketplace an infant formula that is adulterated or misbranded inonly a technical way, such market removal does not constitute a recallsubject to this subpart. Under longstanding agency policy, a firm's removalfrom the market of a product that is violative in some minor way (e.g.,inconsequential deviations from good manufacturing practices), but wouldnot be subject to seizure under current agency policy, is deemed to bea market withdrawal and not a recall. To constitute a recall, the subjectproduct must be both violative and actionable (21 CFR 7.3(g)). Thus, eventhough this rule may require an infant formula manufacturer to notify FDAof a technical or minor instance of adulteration or misbranding, such notificationwill not necessarily trigger an FDA-required or even a firm-initiated recall.Accordingly, FDA believes that andSection; 107.240(a) accurately implementsthis part of the 1986 amendments. For this reason, the language of andSection;107.240(a) remains as originally proposed. FDA does believe, however, that the change in format recommended for andSection;107.240 has merit and, thus, has implemented that suggestion in the finalregulation. Furthermore, in order to clarify the status of market recallsunder this rule, FDA is revising andSection; 107.210 (originally proposedas andSection; 7.69) to state clearly that a manufacturer's voluntary removalfrom the market of an infant formula that is adulterated or misbrandedin only a minor way and that would not be subject to agency legal actionconstitutes a market withdrawal within the meaning of 21 CFR 7.3(j). Asrevised, andSection; 107.210(b) states that manufacturers conducting a marketwithdrawal may, but are not required to, adhere to the requirements ofthis subpart pertaining to product recalls. Revised andSection; 107.210(b)also clarifies that, as discussed above, a manufacturer conducting a marketwithdrawal must nevertheless notify FDA of the adulteration or misbranding,as required by andSection; 107.240(a). FDA does not consider this revisionof andSection; 107.210 to be a substantive change requiring reproposal becausethe preamble to the proposed rule clearly indicated the agency's intentto exclude market withdrawals from the recall requirements. (``As revised,new andSection; 7.69 [now andSection; 107.210] would apply to an infant formulathat has been distributed, that does not present a human health risk, butthat is otherwise in violation of the laws and regulations administeredby FDA and against which the agency could initiate legal or regulatoryaction.'' (See 52 FR 30171 and 30172; August 13, 1987.)) In addition to the modifications in the final rule discussed above, FDAis making minor editorial changes in andSection;andSection; 107.200, 107.220,107.230, 107.240, and 107.250 to achieve greater clarity and consistencyin the final rule. (These sections were originally proposed as andSection;andSection;7.68, 7.70, 7.71, 7.72, and 7.73, respectively.) FDA has determined thatnone of these modifications initiated by the agency is a substantive changethat requires reproposal of the regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of thisrule as announced in the proposed rule of August 13, 1987 (52 FR 3017).No new information or comments have been received that would affect theagency's previous determination that there is no significant impact onthe human environment and that an environmental impact statement is notrequired. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Impact </ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency previouslyconsidered the potential effects that this rule would have on small entities,including small businesses. In accordance with section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFelxibility Act, the agency has determined that no significant impact ona substantial number of small entities would derive from this action. FDAhas not received any new information or comments that would alter its previousdetermination. In accordance with Executive Order 12291, FDA has previously analyzed thepotential economic effects of this final rule. As announced in the proposal,the agency has determined that the rule is not a major rule as definedby the Order. The agency has not received any new information or commentsthat would alter its previous determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>Section 107.280 of this final rule contains collection of information requirementsthat were submitted for review and approval to the Director, Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB), as required by section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980.
