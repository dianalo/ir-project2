Developing nations have a $1.3 trillion foreign debt, mostly tobanks in the industrialized Western nations.   Many Third World nations are unable to pay even the interest ontheir debt, and their economies are stagnating as their scarcefunds are used to repay debt rather than build their economies.   ``Radical new steps are needed, a kind of New Deal,'' saidShevardnadze, speaking in Russian with the help of a translator.   He said the United States and his country should share advancedtechnology with the developing world, and said ``some debt'' shouldbe forgiven, a concept already being advanced by Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady.   The Soviet Union holds almost none of the developing world'sdebt.   Shevardnadze compared the Soviet Union's current social upheavaland economic travail with the Great Depression in America, whenradical sentiment grew and many Soviet Communists predicted theimminent downfall of capitalism.   ``In 1929, a powerful and confident state took an economicnosedive. There were bread lines in New York's Times Square andtents of the jobless huddled along Riverside Drive.   ``In Washington, troops were fighting the Bonus Army that hadinvaded the capital. People were dying in demonstrations, strikesand riots,'' said Shevardnadze, adding that the same is happeningin his country today.   The Soviet Union's ``economic system is undergoing anadjustment,'' he said. ``Something similar happened in the UnitedStates 60 years ago.''   But he added, ``so long as there is the will, the understandingof the situation and the determination to change things for thebetter _ and we certainly have them _ the economy can remedy itsills.''   Shevardnadze predicted that nations would one day compete ``notfor political supremacy or spheres of influence but for access towater, fresh air and even a green lawn. Such conflicts could becaused by demographic problems, hunger and poverty among part ofthe world's population, or by epidemics of infectious disease.''   During a question-and-answer session, Shevardnadze declined tosay whether the Soviet Union is likely to renew diplomatic tieswith Israel any time soon.   He also ducked a question on Soviet policy toward the flow ofrefugees from East Germany to West Germany, saying ``those twocountries will be able to sort out that problem.''</TEXT></DOC>
