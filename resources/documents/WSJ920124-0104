A special Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll on thenation's economy shows that voters overwhelmingly prefer thecongressional Democrats' proposals to the plan President Bushis expected to unveil when he delivers his State of the UnionAddress next Tuesday.</LP><TEXT>   The survey of 1,502 registered voters, taken betweenFriday and Tuesday, shows that 66% of the public, and even amajority of Republicans, favor the Democratic plan for alarger tax cut for the middle class than the president iscontemplating and a cut in the capital-gains tax only if itis accompanied by a tax increase on upper-income Americans.Only 27% prefer the plan Mr. Bush supports, which includes amodest middle-class tax cut along with the capital-gains taxcut.   In fact, despite a deep public desire for the governmentto do something -- almost anything -- to rescue the economy,voters oppose cutting the capital gains rate by a margin of48% to 42%.   The president's plan &quot;will be in for tough going againstmore-popular Democratic alternatives,&quot; conclude Democraticpollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Vince Breglio,who conducted the survey for the Journal and NBC. &quot;Any timeyou add capital gains to any Republican package, that packageis going to go down&quot; in public esteem.   To be sure, it's possible that Mr. Bush's State of theUnion speech and subsequent lobbying campaign can convincevoters that some proposals that they don't initially warm to,such as the capital gains cut and other tax breaks forbusiness, are necessary to revive a flat economy. GOPconsultant Linda DiVall says that if the president can&quot;define the debate on his terms&quot; -- emphasizing change andeconomic growth while overcoming concerns about fairness --he can still win over voters.   Rich Bond, an adviser to the Bush/Quayle campaign, addsthat the bright spotlight on the speech offers the presidenta chance &quot;to regain control of the agenda&quot; and &quot;begin torestore the faith of the American people in his ability tomanage the economy.&quot;   But others are more skeptical of the president's chances.&quot;He's never been particularly good at making publicarguments,&quot; says George C. Edwards III of the Center forPresidential Studies at Texas Aandamp;M University. &quot;The biggestthing he's going to get out of this {speech}, if anything, isthe sense that he's got a plan.&quot;   And even some GOP strategists say Mr. Bush would be betteroff if he focused his efforts on convincing lawmakers, ratherthan voters, that a capital gains cut is needed for growth.&quot;I don't think you could ever mobilize the American peoplebehind something called the capital gains tax,&quot; saysRepublican consultant Eddie Mahe. &quot;They don't think it hasanything to do with them. It sounds awfully suspicious.&quot;   This widespread skepticism of the president's recipe foreconomic renewal comes at a critical time in the politicalcalendar, when Mr. Bush is facing a challenge in his ownparty from conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan in NewHampshire, largely on economic issues, and when 56% of allvoters believe the current recession is severe.   And Mr. Bush's problems with the public go beyond theparticulars of his economic program. The Journal/NBC pollalso shows that most Americans don't buy his attempts toblame the Democratic Congress for making matters worse byblocking his ideas on the economy and other domestic issues.A 57% majority agrees with the statement that the president&quot;has not provided leadership&quot; and &quot;is just blaming Democratsin Congress as an excuse for not doing his job.&quot; By contrast,only 34% say that Mr. Bush is &quot;making a good-faith effort todeal with the country's economic and domestic problems, butthe Democrats in Congress are playing politics by blockinghis proposals.&quot;   Overall, 57% of the nation's voters think Congress shouldpass a tax cut as a way to help stimulate the U.S. economy,and 48% believe that Congress will pass one. Yet only 18%think a tax cut will improve the economy very much, and whenasked what the best use for any savings from defense cutswould be, only 14% choose a tax cut.   &quot;The key word here is focus,&quot; say pollsters Hart andBreglio. &quot;A tax cut per se doesn't turn people on very much,but if it's a focused tax cut that helps families, that hasmuch more appeal.&quot;   Nearly nine out of 10 voters think providing a tax cut forfamilies with children would be an effective way to improvethe economy; nearly as many believe a $2,000 tax credit forfirst-time home buyers would also be effective.   A 38% plurality says that the main purpose of a tax billthis year should be to cut middle-class taxes, while 28% saythe main purpose should be to increase taxes for upper-incomeearners. Only 15% cite giving tax incentives to businessesthat invest in new equipment, and only 9% cite cutting thecapital-gains tax.   President Bush doesn't get all the blame for the economy'scurrent travails. Nearly one voter in three attributes themto &quot;the normal business cycle,&quot; with one voter in fivesingling out President Bush for the most blame.   But the president is clearly suffering politically fromthe intense public concern with unemployment. Fifty-threepercent cite it as the nation's No. 1 economic problem; thesecond most-cited problem, the deficit, is named by only 16%.   &quot;Voters' concern with unemployment has directly costPresident Bush votes,&quot; say pollsters Hart and Breglio. Amongvoters who cite joblessness as the No. 1 problem, thepresident runs no better than even against an unnamedDemocratic opponent; among all other voters, Mr. Bush has an18-point lead.   In the poll, 58% of voters think joblessness will increasein the next 12 months; 38% believe that inflation willincrease in the next year. Adding to voters' general economicunease, 58% believe the banking system isn't sound.   Nor are voters happy with their household financialsituation. Three in five say their family has been directlyaffected by the recession; 39% say that someone in theirhousehold has had his or her income reduced in the past sixmonths because of a reduction in hours worked, lost overtime,a salary cut or lost business.   More than half those interviewed said they have beencutting down on purchases and spending, with 40% saying theyhave been cutting down on savings and other investments, asubstantial increase from the 24% who said they were in May1990.</TEXT></DOC>
