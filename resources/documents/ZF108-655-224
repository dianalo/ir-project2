First, the datesbrought it to within two weeks of PC Expo in New York, making it verydifficult to justify attending both shows, and second, the crowd this yearcontained a higher percentage of &quot;End-Users&quot; than normal.andP;  While this may notbe bad for the vendors, it is very different from the historical reasons forComdex.andP;  Comdex is an industry trade show as opposed to a show designed toprovide a forum for end-users.andP;  PC Expo, on the other hand, is billed as ashow for the industry to display its wares to the end-user community.andM;Whatever the results of this confusion of shows, vendors we talked to werestill very happy with the response here.andP;  They were doing business on thefloor, in the hallways, and in the restaurants of Atlanta.andP;  And doingbusiness is what this show is all about, no matter who comes to see whatproducts.andM;On to the ShowandM;As far as the show floor is concerned, the press and analysts were allwandering around trying to find a theme, a common thread, or a prevalenttopic for the show.andP;  Each year the press really enjoys  dubbing' Comdex asthe show of the 80286, the show of the laptop, the show of the LAN, or someother such thing.andP;  This year, if there was any theme at all, it was veryclearly that serious computing requires big, fast machines, with big, fastvideo, and with lots and lots of different peripherals connected to it.andM;Although some of what we saw will be described in detail later, anencapsulation might be as follows:andM;Every desktop systems vendor on the floor had at least one, if not more,80486 25 MHz or 33 MHz system up and running (even though deliveries mill lagbecause of a shortage of CPUs from Intel).andP;  Everybody had a 386-33 and a386SX box.andP;  Some had entire product lines running from the 286 to the 486.andO;Some of the more aggressive vendors were showing 486-based products designedfor servers with multiple 486 CPUs running in them.andM;Every company you would expect to be there with a laser printer was there,some that you might not expect to be important players will be, and the laserprinter add-on and add-in market is really heating up with cartridges,toners, paper feeders, and every other type of add-in or add-on device youmight imagine (and some you might not even think about).andP;  Dot matrix printerswere also there in great numbers, and color printers are beginning to show upin ever-increasing numbers.andM;Laptops are appearing everywhere.andP;  Those desktop system companies already inthe market who now offer at least one laptop are more prevalent than thosewho do not.andP;  Companies who are already in th c laptop or portable business,from major to minor, have really begun to flood the market with new product.andO;Making a purchase decision in this area is going to be extremely tough in themonths ahead.andP;  In addition, there were a number of fairly good color laptopscreens on display, both in the booths and behind the scenes.andM;Networks were there in force, naturally, but they were not making much noisewith the exception of the two related announcements discussed below).andP;  Thiswas partially due to missing players and partially due to the fact that thereis not that much new that is exciting in this area.andP;  More and more companiesare installing more and more networks.andP;  The number of users per networkcontinues to go up, and hardware and software vendors keep adding new productofferings which are, at the moment, extensions of their existing productlines.andM;What was NOT at the ShowandM;I was convinced that everywhere I walked on the Comdex floor I would findcompanies hyping Windows 3.0 applications.andP;  Boy was I wrong! Actually, thefew Windows products there were aimed at the 3270 marketplace and were beingoffered by DCA and others.andP;  There was a little Windows 3.0 software-but verylittle.andP;  Microsoft was not at the show nor were Lotus, Ashton-Tate, Apple,Novell, or even IBM.andP;  Most of the present Windows 3.0 developers who areready with a product are on a road show, sponsored by Microsoft, which isdesigned to bring Windows to the people.andP;  (It is very interesting to me thatwhile Microsoft did not exhibit at Comdex/Spring, they did have their ownGraphical User Interface road show on Monday and Tuesday at the MarriottMarquis.andP;  When we asked, they said they did it on purpose to take advantageof the diverse audience at Comdex.)andM;Anyway, I guess that it is too early for all but the biggest developers to beready to market their 3.0-based products.andP;  Most of the others will be rollingout product over the next few months and I suspect that by Comdex/Fall, wewill have had more than enough of 3.0 offerings.andP;  The few products that werethere were not yet ready for prime time.andP;  Some were in very rough alpha andsome in beta, but I did not find a single new product on the floor that wasshipping for Windows 3.0, other than those for the 3270 world and thosealready announced at the Microsoft Windows 3.0 roll-out.andM;Pointing DevicesandM;Those of you who read my Windows 3.0 coverage last month probably rememberthe short article I wrote about pointing devices.andP;  Briefly, I said thatpointing devices would become a very personal choice for most people, andthat this will spawn renewed interest in these devices and in alternatives tothem.andM;During the show, I stopped at each and every keyboard vendor I could findand, with one exception, I was either shown keyboards with pointing devicesbuilt-in (usually a trackball), or told that one or more products was/is onthe drawing board for immediate future release (sort of like, it's not readybut it will be soon).andP;  For more on pointing devices, see the Aandgt; prompt columnat the end of this issue.andM;Pointing Pevices are going to be a very big business in the next few years.andO;Not only are they very important to a user of Windows, but they are alsocheap (inexpensive) enough that users might actually end up with two or moreof these gadgets before finding the right one for their own needs.andP;  It isVERY important to note that if you are going to buy a keyboard with abuilt-in device, you REALLY should make sure that the keyboard has a feel youlike as well.andP;  Don't just assume that a keyboard is a keyboard.andP;  As I havesaid before, this just is not so.andP;  A good case in point are the threemachines we recently received from Compaq for review.andP;  All three keyboardslook the same, each of them was shipped with a specific unit, yet two of themare VERY different from the third.andM;The ones which were shipped for use with the 286N and 386N systems are notvery good at all.andP;  In fact, the space bar is so bad that all of us who havetried them tend to miss spaces and do not like the feel of the space bar atall.andP;  Using the one shipped with the i486 system, however, is very differentand we all like it.andP;  I do not understand why there is a difference because Ifound that the part numbers are identical, but there is a difference.andP;  So,try before you buy.andM;Software of NoteandM;Automate/Anytime, by Complementary Solutions, Inc. (4470 Chamblee DunwoodyRoad, Suite 202, Atlanta, GA 30338; 404-454-8033), I found to be a reallyneat product.andP;  Before I take you into a more detailed description of it, theconcept is this: I pre-program my machine to interrupt what I am doing at aspecific time, save out to disk all of that job, project, or whatever,including the memory of the system, start a pre-planned job, complete thatone, and return to the first task, all without any human intervention.andM;In other words, you can pre-program your system to perform back-up (to tapeor disk), run a job that takes a long time, or run any other program you wishduring the night when your system is not busy, or at specific times duringthe day.andP;  I was very impressed with the thought that went into this utility.andO;Not only is it very easy to program these delayed tasks, but some things youmight not even think about have been added.andP;  For example, if you back up yoursystem at 3:00 AM on Thursday, but want the files to reflect the time anddate of Wednesday for tracking purposes, you merely tell the program that forthis back-up, time-stamp the files using the internal clock's time minus 12hours (or whatever).andM;The formal description of the program says that you can run batch file jobs,keyboard macro jobs, or back-up jobs automatically, anytime you choose.andP;  Forbatch jobs, the program comes with an easy-to-use editor for job instructionpreparation.andP;  For keyboard macro jobs, there is a learn function built in.andO;The back-up and restore part of the program compresses EXE, COM and datafiles up to 85 percent and permits copying backup files to any logical DOSdevice.andP;  There is no limit to the number of jobs you can pre-program, and youcan choose daily, weekly, or even monthly schedules (similar to programmingyour VCR to catch your favorite show while you are away).andP;  An audit log ofexecuted tasks is provided and the system is network compatible.andP;  Check thisone out if you have a need to run large jobs and don't want to tic up yoursystem during normal business hours.andM;Data Compression HardwareandM;With the price of hard disk drives coming down, you might wonder why acompany would develop a new data compression product designed to increase theamount of disk drive storage On the other hand, after you install Windows 3.0and just a few applications, you might wonder exactly what happened to that40 MB of disk space you thought you had.andM;InfoChip Systems, Inc. (2840 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 90501;408-727-0514), was showing off a product which is so exciting that I aminclined to consider it to be in the same league as a car that has beendesigned to run on water instead of gasoline.andP;  (I hope that the disk drivevendors do not band together and string these folks up.)andM;The product is called EXPANZ! and is a card which fits inside your PC.andP;  Theproduct sells for under $200 and will be available in July of this year.andO;EXPANZ! transparently increases the storage capacity of hard drives up to 3times (yes, you get 120 MB of storage from a 40 MB drive!), and floppy diskstorage is expanded up to 15 times.andP;  Prior to Comdex/Spring, we had a chanceto see this card in operation, and while we have not had a chance to do athorough evaluation, we did prove to ourselves that it works, and it workswell.andP;  The beauty of the card is that you install it in your system andbasically forget it.andP;  It works in real-time, compressing and uncompressingdata on-the-fly as you request it and as you normally use it.andP;  If you want tobypass the compression for a specific job, or to write data out to a  normal'floppy, you can, and InfoChip claims 100% data integrity.andM;The compression technique used is called noiseless/lossless compression.andP;  Theheart of the system is a chip they call the IC-105 data compressionco-processor, and while the product is an add-in board type of product at themoment, it is easy to see that it could be included directly on themotherboard of a laptop or other unit to provide 60 MB of storage using a 20MB hard drive.andM;The device works not only with hard drives and floppies, but also with anyrandom access storage device including hard disks, floppies, optical disks,and even RAM disks.andP;  The speed claim made by InfoChips is that you will seevirtually' no change in system performance, and in our tests we did notnotice any slowdown of data storage or retrieval using a 386/25-based system.andM;The card is a half-card device so that it will fit into those laptops alreadyon the market which provide industry standard half-length slots, and it worksin both 8 and 16 bit systems.andP;  It is compatible with any 8086 through i486based system, running DOS 3.X (4.0 compatibility will come by the fall of1990), and it does away with the normal 32 MB DOS hard disk partitionlimitation.andM;Compression ratios listed by InfoChip are as follows: For CCITT Group IIdocuments, 4-15 to 1 (4-15:1); for Database files, 3-8:1; for Image Files,1.5-7:1; CAD/CAM 2-12:1; wordprocessing and spreadsheet files, 2.4:1; and forexecutable code files (EXE and COM), a compression ratio of 1-2:1 is claimed.andO;In our tests, we used a 40 MB drive and after compression we had over 90 MBof space (since the drive was not full of data, we were not able to test theupper limits of the product, but we will provide further test informationafter we receive our review copy).andM;This was definitely one of the most impressive new products of the show, andjudging by the traffic in the booth, it had a lot of people very excited.andO;Obviously, there is also a certain amount of skepticism in the buying public.andO;Until the product has been out in the field and in use for some time, wewould not expect the excitement to really build.andP;  Once it has been proven tomeet all of the vendor's claims, I think that this product will go a long wayto help solve the Windows 3.0 disk space shock many of us will be goingthough.andP;  Nice work !andP;  PrintersandM;Hewktt-Packard was very aggressive at this year's show.andP;  Not only did theyhave a large booth filled to overflowing with Laserjet IIPs, Ills, manyVectras, and other laser printer offerings, but they also sponsored abreakfast for the press and had many vendors who support their printerspresent to help make us all believers.andM;The HP LaserJet III was drawing crowds.andP;  What with its enhanced printingmode, which provides better resolution than you would expect from a 300 dpisystem, the soon-to-be available PostScript cartridge, and AppleTalk(LocalTalk) connection, this printer is bound to do very well.andP;  The streetprice for the list price $2395 system is already in the  1500+ range makingit a very attractive offering indeed.andM;One of the vendors present at the HP breakfast was AGFA's CompugrahicsDivison (200 Ballardvale Street, Wilmington, MA 01887; 508-658-5600) whoannounced the release of six collections of Intellifont Scalable Typefaceoutlines for use with their Type Director Font Management Program.andP;  These sixcollections bring the AGFA Compugraphic type library to over 150 designsavailable on disk.andP;  Each pack contains 12 faces and retails for $199.andM;Since the HP Laserjet III incorporates the AGFA Compugrahics intellifontscaling technology, these fonts provide &quot;on-the-fly' type scaling fromone-quarter-point to 999.75 points in quarter-point increments  enough sizesto satisfy anyone).andP;  AFGA also has all of their fonts available on a CD-ROM.andO;In this case, the user purchases the CD-ROM and gets 12 fonts  unlocked' forthe initial price of the disk.andP;  At any time, he can call AFGA and get anyother group of 12 fonts &quot;unlocked&quot; and ready for use.andP;  The big advantage tothis form of type distribution is the fact that a company can purchase theCD, use the fonts it needs the most, and when a job requires a special font,merely make a phone call, receive the unlocking code over the phone, andproceed to use the new fonts.andP;  This is a real boon for job shops and otherswho may have specific type face requirements, yet do not want to have topurchase fonts they may never use.andM;PanasonicandM;The most exciting new laser printer at the show was not, however, in the HPbooth, but just down the aisle in the Panasonic display.andP;  While our laserprinter review this month covers the Panasonic Model KX-4420, the one whichreally caught my eye was the model KX-P4455.andP;  This is a full PostScriptprinter running at 300 dpi and at a speed of 11 pages per minute (as opposedto 8, 6, and 4 PPM offered by most other manufacturers).andM;The PostScript is version 51.4 and the system includes 39 Adobe fonts and 2MB of RAM (expandable to 4 MB).andP;  The printer also emulates the HP Laserjet IIand a Diablo printer, has serial, parallel, and AppleTalk interfaces builtin, as well as dual paper bins.andM;Right, 11 pages per minute, full PostScript, AppleTalk, and dual-bin feedeach bin holds 250 sheets).andP;  Sounds like a real work horse and it must have avery high price.andP;  Well, in fact, the most startling thing to me about thisprinter is that you get all of the above at a price of under $3500.andP;  List!andO;That puts the street price for the system down into the  2700-$2900 range fora printer that stands apart from the crowd in both speed and paper handlingcapabilities.andP;  Panasonic has a real winner on their hands with this machine.andO;We mill be providing an in-depth review of the product after we receive it inour lab.andP;  If you are interested in finding out more about this product, callPanasonic at 1-800-PIC-8086 and ask for the name of the dealer nearest you.andM;Optical Read-Write DisksandM;Optical media is becoming the big item for storage and retrieval of data.andO;Many companies had CD-ROM drives on the floor, and many also had varioussizes and shapes of read-write optical disks.andP;  While these devices are stillslow when compared to a hard disk, they do hold lots and lots of data.andP;  Twocompanies on the floor were showing drives which are basically the same.andO;Ocean Microsystems, Inc. (246 East Hacienda Avenue, Campbell, CA 95008;408-374-8300), and Pinnacle were both showing a 130 MB Magneto-Opticalremoveable media disk drive.andP;  The cartridge is a removable 3.5 inchMagneto-Optical (MO) cartridge (the same size as a standard 3.5 inch floppy),and the claims made by Ocean seem to indicate that it is a very fast opticaldrive.andP;  I say &quot;seem to indicate' because they claim an average Seek Time of28 ms and an average transfer rate of 512K/second.andP;  I have two problems withthese figures and, in fact, with Ocean.andP;  First, when I asked them if thedrive was their own, I was told that it was and when I questioned them indetail about the access times quoted, I was told that the numbers were good,solid numbers.andP;  Both of these comments just go to prove that vendors shouldbe careful about their claims.andP;  Regarding the percentage of the drive, it isnot their own but, in fact, one that both of these companies OEM from MOST inLos Angeles.andP;  MOST is a subsidiary of Mountain Hardware of Scotts Valley,California, and at present is supplying the drive to both vendors.andP;  Second,MOST does not claim that the drive's access time is anywhere near 28 ms,being more conservative and claiming only about 45-48 ms for average seektime.andP;  Still, that is faster than most optical disks, and a real step forwardin technology.andP;  The product is impressive and is a forebearer of excitingthings to come.andP;  I only wish that companies such as Ocean would stick more tothe facts and less to the hype.andM;Portable ComputersandM;When vendors start offering add-in and add-on products for your system, doesit mean you have arrived? If the answer is &quot;Yes,&quot; then Poqet COmputer (650North Mary Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94086; 408-737-8100) has arrived.andP;  Poqet wasvery much in evidence with a new booth and lots of Poqet PCs that peoplecould touch and feel.andP;  The latest addition to their product is a completelyredesigned keyboard which feels more like a &quot;real&quot; keyboard, and gives a morefinished' look to the product.andM;Poqet has not been able to deliver large quantifies of the Poqet PC becausethey have been working on the new keyboard design.andP;  The wait is worth it.andO;When I put the old unit and the new unit side-by-side, it was very obviousthat they have made great strides in the design and feel of the keyboard.andM;While it still is not possible to type at 100 words per minute on thismachine, I found that the new keyboard makes the system much more compatiblewith what we all have come to expect in a keyboard.andP;  The keys are stillfull-sized and the spacing between keys is still less than standard, but thefeel&quot; of them is much nicer and the entire system is, therefore, easier touse.andM;Poqet says that limited quantities of this model will be available startingin the summer and the production ramp-up beyond that should make themavailable in quantity by the end of the third quarter.andM;However, back to the add-on premise.andP;  A company called MicroNet Technology,Inc. (20 Mason, Irvine, CA, 92718; 714-837-6033), was showing a product theycall the MicroDocket for the Poqet (more cute names?).andP;  This device containsa 20, 40, or 120 MB hard drive, a 2400 baud modem, serial printer andcommunications port, and an external SCSI port.andP;  The entire package is thesame width and depth as the Poqet PC (they showed the Poqet PC sitting on topof it), weighs in at 4.5 pounds, and is fully portable.andM;The 20 MB and 40 MB versions use a hard drive with 25 ms average access whilethe 120 MB system sports a 16 ms access drive.andP;  The SCSI interface is fullyMacintosh compatible, and the system also has a built-in battery charger anduniversal input power supply.andP;  The measurements of the unit are 9.5 incheswide, 2.5 inches high, and 7.5 inches deep.andP;  While you won't be able to fitthis Poqet in your pocket, you will be able to fit both the Poqet and theDocket in your briefcase and carry along a truly powerful computer systemwith a total weight of 5.5 pounds (you can, of course, carry the Poqet everywhere and return to the docking unit whenever you want to).andP;  Price andavailability information was not available at press time.andP;  We suspect thatthis is the first of many add-on options which will find their way into themarket as the Poqet PC becomes more readily available.andM;More Laptops and Portable ComputersandM;Almost everywhere I looked on the show floor, I could see a new laptop orportable.andP;  With the increased growth in this market segment, more and morecompanies are flocking to the party.andP;  Not only are the major players takingpart in the laptop explosion, but also, many companies we have never heard ofare entering the field.andM;Some of the typical offerings included United Electronics Systems, Inc. (601N. Vermont Ave, Suite 100, Los Angeles, CA 90004; 213-669-1234), with their11.5 pound, 286/16 based VGA laptop.andP;  This unit comes standard with 1 MB ofRAM expandable to 5 MB, has a single 1.44 MB, 3.5 inch floppy, and a choiceof a 20 or 40 MB hard drive.andP;  Two serial ports, a parallel port, externalvideo, and external keyboard connector are all standard, and a T3100-typeexpansion slot is provided.andM;UESI is a newcomer to this market and is one of the companies that believesin providing weight figures without the batteries being included.andP;  If you addthe battery weight to this product, you add another 4.5 pounds for a total of15 pounds, and you get two hours of battery use.andP;  This unit is the model NBCC286 and measures 12.6 inches wide, 13.6 inches deep, and 3.6 inches high,making it miss the magic 12 inch depth for case of use on an airplane traytable.andP;  The screen is of the LCD backlit-type and supports VGA at 640 x 480,EGA, CGA, and Hercules modes.andM;Look Ma, No KeysandM;One of the hottest areas to have bundles of money and talent thrown at itthis year is portable computers without keyboards.andP;  Rumors of companies thatare working on machines that recognize hand writing abound and companies havebeen formed to develop software for these machines.andP;  IBM has invested in onehardware company that apparently may have a jump on some others.andP;  If you hadto pick the next area of major innovation in the world of portables, youwould not be wrong to go with the keyboardless units.andP;  Interestingly, BobFrankston, VisiCalc co-founder, has left his Chief Scientist post at LotusDevelopment to join Slate Development, one of these keyboardless computerdevelopment firms.andM;Micro Slate (9625 Ignace St, Suite D, Brossard, QC J4Y 2P3 Canada;514-444-3680) was on the show floor with their Datalite 300L, billed as thefirst Keyboardless Touch Screen Toteable PC with a 386SX Processor.andP;  I agreeit may be the first  Keyboardless Touch Screen Toteable PC with a 386SXProcessor&quot; (whew!), although there have been other systems which usedtouch-screens, and even one (Linus Technologies, see Vol.andP;  6, No.andP;  2, October1987) which had a system in production which used a stylus for an inputdevice.andM;Anyway, the MicroSlate is a nice vertical market product.andP;  It is based on an80386SX running at 16 MHz, comes with 1 MB of RAM and is expandable to 16 MB,has a resistive membrane overlay screen, a parallel port, one internal andone external serial port, and runs on 1 or 2 removeable NiCad batteries.andM;The unit measures 12 5/8 x 10 x 2 3/4 inches and weighs in at 7.5 pounds.andO;External connections include a jack for an AT compatible keyboard, VGA,serial and parallel port, and SCSI hard drive (an internal hard drive with120 MB capacity is optional).andM;The system comes with a library of software and a computer-aided screendesigner so you can program the user interface quickly and easily.andP;  Uses forthis product include such things as multiple choice questions, ranking ofchoices, accumulation of selections, and other vertical applications.andP;  Itwould be ideal, for example, for a nurse to use in a hospital on her rounds.andO;With little effort, she could recall a patient's chart, update it, and thenstore it back into the system until she was back at the nurses' station wherethe updated chart could be sent to the central records computer via serialport.andM;The Datalite includes a pop-up keyboard, keypad, and provides key reportphrases pre-stored in a library built into the system.andP;  Further, there is agrid-type library so that spreadsheet-type applications can be used.andP;  One ofthe really slick examples that was running on the demonstration machine wasan expense account system where you just select the day, select the expense,and the pop-up keypads and keyboard permits data entry.andP;  This is a neatmachine and should find many uses in environments where typing data is aproblem.andM;Flytech Technology, Inc. (3008 Scott Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95054;408-727-7373), showed up at Comdex with a somewhat unique approach to a smallcomputer.andP;  It is not designed to be a portable computer, per sc, but it isdesigned to provide a very small and it can be easily carried from place toplace.andP;  The theory seems to be that the user would have a power supply,monitor, and keyboard at each of several locations and would merely transportthe basic unit from place to place.andM;The system is available with a 10 MHz 8088 or a 12 MHz 80286.andP;  The small mainunit is just a little longer than two 3.5 inch floppy disk drives and onlyabout 2 inches high (actually, the literature says that it is 240 MM x 185 MMx 45 MM but I was too lazy to convert it for you).andP;  (Copy Editor's note: 9.45x 7.28 x 1.77 inches, I'm not too lazy.) None of the specifications aredifferent from the other thousands of systems on the market, but it is aunique foot print size.andP;  If small but functional is what you want for youroffice, then this might be a unit for you to investigate.andM;Note: Many of the vendors providing laptop products are new to thecomputerfield, and while their products may seem to be  bargain' priced(Cheap!), the issue of service and support must be considered in the purchasedecision process.andP;  just as with PC vendors, laptop vendors will be enteringand leaving this market in great numbers over the course of the next fewyears.andP;  However, unlike the PC, laptops are not products which can beserviced and supported by just anyone.andP;  All of these products have beendesigned from the ground up as laptops and all of them require specializedservice in the event of a failure.andP;  Therefore, it is even more critical inthe laptop arena to make sure you know enough about the vendor to be assuredthey will be around for a long time and they will continue to support theirproducts.andP;  Cheaper is not always the best way to go, especially in thismarket.andM;Pointing Devices ...andP;  AgainandM;Marcus is a Tracker Ball from Marconi (Marconi Circuit Technology, 160 SmithStreet, Farmingdale, NY 11735; 515-293-8686).andP;  It is billed as ahigh-resolution trackball device designed to replace a mouse for bothpointing and for CAD/CAM drawing, desktop publishing, and other programswhich require more precision than a standard mouse can provide.andP;  Developed byMarconi from work done in the aerospace industry, the model RB2 includesthree buttons and includes driver software.andP;  I was impressed with thisproduct after using it in a demo mode.andP;  It has a nice feel to it.andP;  The centerbutton is much larger than the other two, giving the user good tactileresponse, and the ability to find the correct button easily, even whengroping for it.andM;Winner Products (18325 Valley Blvd, Suite A, La Puente, CA 91744;818-810-2705) was showing both a mouse and a joystick.andP;  The mouse comescomplete with GEOS DeskTop software including file management, diskmanagement, and a calculator.andP;  You can change the mode of the mouse dependingupon how you turn your system on.andP;  For example, to invoke the proportionalmode, you turn the system on as you normally would.andP;  However, to wake up themouse in the joystick mode, you power on while holding the right button down,and for paddle mode, you hold down the left button.andP;  They also offer ajoystick for those of you who would rather &quot;fly&quot; your Windows than run amouse around the desk.andM;Logitech, Inc. (Kaiser Drive, Fremont, CA 94555; 415795-8500), was displayingboth mice and trackball devices.andP;  We received one of each to experiment withafter we returned from Atlanta.andP;  I have fallen for the Trackman, which theybill as a  &quot;High Resolution Stationary Mouse.' It is designed purely for theright-handed amongst us, which I am not.andP;  This seems to be its only flaw.andO;However, I still took to it in a hurry.andP;  The big difference between thistrackball and others I have used is that the ball is smaller than the othersand is located to the left of the buttons.andP;  The unit I have to test has threebuttons where you can rest your fingers while moving the ball with yourthumb.andP;  It is a very natural feel and it brings new meaning to &quot;point andshoot&quot; since your fingers are already on the buttons.andP;  Simply move the ballwith your thumb until the pointer is where you want it and 'shoot' with oneof your fingers.andM;The manuals are easy to follow and the utilities disks include a driver sothat buttons and combinations of buttons can be used to do things you wouldnormally do with your keyboard from within programs.andP;  In fact, even if youare not into Windows yet, there is a program called Mouse-2-3 which lets youmake Lotus 1-2-3 into a mouse (trackball) responsive program.andP;  Logitech makessome really nice products and everything we have tried of theirs has workedout of the box.andM;Testing, Pieces and PartsandM;I am always being asked about laboratory testing services.andP;  We do a lot oflaboratory testing for vendors, but do not get into FCC-type testing.andO;International Compliance Corporation (812 Office Park Circle, Lewisville, TX75057; 214-221-7071), however, does perform FCC testing for vendors.andM;Their services include testing for the entire range of FCC compliancerequirements under Part 15  Class A and B Computing Devices), Part 18, Part68 (Telecommunications), and much more.andP;  In addition, they provide consultingservices in Radio Frequency Interference and ESD Design, packaging, PC boardlayout, and other such areas.andP;  I never know when I might need to recommendthese services to someone, so this company goes in my reference file.andP;  Itshould go in yours also if you need to pass FCC tests.andP;  It is always a goodidea to try out the equipment in someone else's lab first.andM;Faxes and ModemsandM;Yet another player has emerged in the fast growing FAX/Modem marketplace.andO;Each new company brings its own view of what will sell and what is possible.andO;This time the company is Micro Electronic Technologies, Inc. (35 SouthStreet, Hopkinton, MA 01748; 508-435-9057), and the products are a mix ofexternal and internal products.andM;They offer a fairly standard line of fax and phone modems, using a 1/2 sizeinternal mount PC card, pocket sized external device, and standard desktopmodem/fax packages.andP;  They are yet another modem company.andP;  But the featurewhich caught my attention is that their units can select COM 1 through COM 4,a handy option in today's world of serial port conflicts.andM;Roll Your OwnandM;Once again the floor(s) was filled to overflowing with companies sellingno-name boards, cases, power supplies, cards, monitors, power cords, andevery other piece and part you might possibly want if you are into buildingyour own computers.andP;  I wonder how long it will be before some large end-usercompany decides to purchase all of the pieces and parts and build their ownbrand-name computer? This might start a fad-imagine that you worked for acompany such as TRW or Hughes and instead of the purchasing departmentgetting you the latest IBM or Compaq system, you were provided with aTRW-1000SXXSDERTY (it has to have more letters in the name, after allcompanies such as TRW are used to selling things to the government).andM;Anyway, one of the companies representative of the high-end of the pieces andparts business is IPX (Infomatic Power Systems Corp., 9832 Alburtis Ave,Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670; 213-948 -2217).andP;  This company has a catalogshowing virtually every type of computer case you can imagine, along withkeyboards, motherboards, and power supplies.andM;The cases range from a 10 Drive Bay Super Tower down to a low profile towerand small footprint XT desktop case.andP;  In addition, they are the only companythat I have seen which offers what I call &quot;finish&quot; items including labels forslot designations, and even the pre-formed foam packing materials to ship thefinished products.andM;Cellular Phone ModemsandM;As more and more users take to the road, the idea of marrying a cellularphone with a laptop computer becomes an important issue.andP;  Telebit (1315Chesapeake Terrace, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; 1-800-TELEBIT) was on the floor withtheir complete cellular phone modem system.andP;  The claimed speed of thesemodems is 10,000 bps in the uncompressed mode and up to 16,800 bps whenrunning in the compressed mode of operation.andM;The Telebit family of products includes a CellBlazer modem designed forlaptops, one for desktop computers, and one which is rack mounted anddesigned to be used in a head-end system.andP;  The modems are compatible withmost standard protocols starting at 300 bps, and can be run via any standardcommunications software package.andM;Wires and More WiresandM;Ever wonder how to install a network in an office environment without havingbig hunks of wire running around the baseboards or dropping into cubiclesfrom the ceiling? Panduit (17301 Ridgeland Ave, Tinley Park, II 60477;708-532-1800) was showing off its large selection of surface mounted moldingsand connector boxes.andP;  Thesc channels and boxes can be surface mounted onwalls or floors and hide cables and connectors from view, as well as provideprotection for them.andM;PCs, PCs, and More PCsandM;Even without Compaq and IBM being present, the floor was filled with PCvendors of every size and description.andP;  Some of these companies are smallnewcomers, others have been around for a while and are well established.andO;Some, such as TeleVideo, are in the process of making a comeback now that the80386 and i486 CPUs make it safe to get back into the box wars.andM;TeleVideo (555 E. Brokaw Street, San Jose, CA 95161-9048;408-954-8333),whichmainly sells through VADs and VARs, has not had a very strong product line inrecent years.andP;  However, the number of new products they announced at thisshow places them back into the PC business with both barrels blazing.andP;  Theirad campaign requests that you &quot;Take a new look at TeleVideo.&quot; When we did, wewere impressed with what we saw.andM;Their product line now runs from low-profile 286-12 and 386SX-16 products upto and including two i486-based systems.andP;  They offer a tower designed forserver use and a desktop PC designed with the power user in mind.andP;  Also intheir line are both an 80286 and 386-based, diskless workstation.andP;  Like anumber of vendors are now doing, TeleVideo puts VGA graphics and the serialand parallel ports on the motherboard, leaving more slots available foradd-in options.andP;  In addition to their new systems, TeleVideo also announced aseries of new network adapter cards which are more than competitive.andM;Video Cards and MonitorsandM;Each successive Comdex sees additional emphasis in the video arena.andP;  One ofthe main differences between workstations and PCs is the way in which theyhave typically handled video.andP;  PCs normally use the main CPU to handle thevideo as well as the rest of the systems requirements, while the workstationsof the world off-load the video functions to a separate processor and memory.andO;It does not take a computer mavin or guru to understand that one way to helpcapitalize on a PC's speed is to provide video cards with their ownprocessors and memory on-board.andP;  Comdex/Spring saw a number of thesecombinations.andM;Unique Video CardsandM;Those of you who have experimented with more than one video display in theMacintosh world know that it is possible to connect two monitors and havethem work in conjunction with each other.andP;  You can move the cursor from oneto the other, open a window and set it up on one screen, open a second windowand leave it open on the second screen, and move back and forth between themat will.andM;Colorgraphics Communications Corporation (5388 New Peachtree Road, Atlanta,GA 30366- 404-455-3921) was showing a VGA card for PCs at Comdex which doesthe same thing for a PC.andP;  In fact, when used in conjunction with a PC withon-board VGA, the system will support three monitors.andP;  If you really want toget crazy, you can install up to 4 DUAL VGA+ cards in a system and control upto 8 separate screens.andM;The DUAL VGA+ consists of a full size AT card with 16 bit I/O and interfaceto a system board, two independently programmable VGA sections, two DB-15analog connectors, and a  features' section (see below).andP;  The card supportsextended VGA modes: 256K memory per VGA section, 800 x 600 resolution with 16colors, 132 column monochrome text mode with 25 or 43 lines, and 512K of VGAram per section as an option which supports up to 640 x 480 in 256 colors.andM;What use is there for this card? First, it is possible to use two monitorsfrom within Windows 3.0, for example, and leave several different windowsopen and viewable, and move back and forth from monitor to monitor.andP;  The usercan also use their feature connector to output to an overlay board, or theuser can overlay video images, one over another.andP;  He can create slide shows,do transparency-type presentations, or just have more area in which to work.andO;One way in which we use two monitors in the Macintosh world, for example, isto leave PageMaker up and open on the big screen, and use the other to workwith the next text file or graphic, getting it ready to import intoPageMaker.andP;  This prevents the user from having to change window sizes or moveone window in front of another.andM;LaptopsandM;Many, many companies are getting ready to do battle with the big boys(Compaq, Toshiba, NEC, Zenith, Grid [IBM??], and the others).andP;  However, someof them obviously have not taken the pulse of the industry recently, and areannouncing products which resemble those offered by the above mentionedcompanies eons ago (a generation in the laptop market is measured in months,not years).andP;  As a case in point, let's take a look at a company calledVeridata Research, Inc. This Taiwaneese company has formed a U.S.andP;  Companycalled Veridata Research, Inc. (11901 Goldring Rd, #A, Arcadia, CA 91006;818-303-0613).andP;  These folks were standing in their booth trying to show theentire world their new and great laptops.andP;  I guess that at one point theymust have wondered why the traffic in their booth was not what it should havebeen, given the 66,000+ people who were wandering around Comdex/Spring.andO;However, while the rest of the world was busy showing 286 and 386SX ECA andVGA-based systems in boxes of less than ten pounds, these folks were showingtwo systems, the TurboLite 110 and the TurboLite 111 (the use of the nameTurbo makes me wonder where Zenith is, but Veridata claims to have the abovenames trademarked).andM;The products? Start with an 80C88 running at up to 9.54 MHz (yawn), add in abacklit LCD screen at CGA resolution (double yawn), sprinkle in one system(the 110) with a single 1.44 floppy drive, and one unit with a 20 MB harddrive, and what you have is two units which are at least two generationsbehind most of the offerings being shown on the floor.andP;  To make mattersworse, the specifications make a big deal out of having a floppy with 1.44 MBof storage: &quot;The built-in floppy disk drive runs a capacity of 1.44 MB, i.e.,andO;twice that of the ordinary 720 KB,&quot; and  What's more amazing is that itoperates on batteries, weighs less than 7 pounds, and comes at a veryaffordable price.'andM;Now for the killer.andP;  Not only are the products very &quot;me too' of the lastgeneration, but they also include DR-DOS from Digital Research built intoROM, not Microsoft DOS (I am not picking on DR-DOS, which works well, only onthe fact that a company that wants to compete in a hot market with VERYordinary products certainly should at least offer Microsoft DOS which doesnot require the dealer to defend it).andP;  Sounds to me like this company coulduse a good dose of solid market research prior to bringing out their nextproducts, assuming they are around to do so.andM;Liuski International (10 Hub Drive, Melville, NY 11747; 516-454-8220), on theother hand, was at the show with an 80286 based notebook computer running ata clock speed of 16 MHz, supporting DOS 3.3 or 4.1, with 1 MB of RAM standard(expandable to 4 MB), and a VGA resolution LCD screen.andP;  The system includes a1.44 MB floppy drive as well as either a 20 MB or 40 MB internal hard disk.andO;Two hours of battery operation is claimed and the system features a &quot;smart&quot;power management system.andM;All in all, the floor was filled to overflowing with laptop products.andO;However, we did not see anything to indicate to us that innovation andtechnology investments will come from any unforeseen vendor.andP;  Most of thenon-name brand vendors seem to be happy to compete on a price basis and noneof the products we saw gave any indication of being able to compete with theknown' brands in terms of construction, features, or performance.andM;Laptop EnhancementsandM;In addition to a wide range of new products and add-in products, manycompanies had plenty of new features and functions to show off.andP;  The DeskStation units which have been promised by Toshiba (Toshiba AmericaInformation Systems, Inc., Computer Systems Division, 9740 Irvine Blvd,Irvine, CA 92718; 714-583-3000) for a long time finally came out of thecloset at Comdex with final specifications, delivery dates, and prices.andO;Designed to be used with the T1000SE, XE and T1200XE, the Desk Station unitwill sell for $1199 while the unit for the T3100SX will retail for $1499, andboth will begin shipping in August.andP;  Both systems provide a method of docking' the portable and providing connections to the outside world.andP;  A userdoes not have to fiddle with cables or connectors to convert any of theseunits into a desktop unit connected to printers, networks, and externalstorage devices.andM;The Desk Station for Toshiba's Notebooks has two full-length 16 bit slots, orone full-length 16-bit slot with one half-length slot and one Toshibaproprietary 16-bit slot, one parallel port, two serial ports, and one DCoutput port to both power the notebook and charge the battery.andP;  The T3100SXunit has three slots, 2 full-length 16-bit slots and a half length 8-bitslot, one parallel port, two serial ports, external keyboard port, and oneRJ-11 modem port in addition to the DC output connection.andM;The T1600, the Toshiba 286-based laptop, also got a new face (or at least ascreen).andP;  This new display is said to be 25% faster than the previous one,sporting improved brightness and contrast.andP;  Further, the old price of $4499has been lowered to $3999 for the 20 MB system, and from $4999 to $4699 forthe 40 MB unit.andM;Also announced at Comdex was Toshiba's bundling of Windows 3.0 with theirT3100SX system.andP;  This 386-based laptop is a real powerhouse of a unit.andO;Windows 3.0 on the gas plasma display is very, very readable and the speedand performance of this system under Windows 3.0 is exceptional (see Aandgt;Prompt column for more on this unit).andM;Laptops, Gadgets, and GizmosandM;As with any industry, the laptop market is rapidly attracting vendors who arebuilding devices to make these portable computers more useful, both on andoff the road.andP;  Zirco (10900 W. 44th Ave, Wheat Ridge, CO, 80033;303-421-2031), for example, was in a booth showing off a number of productsdesigned to help us in our quest for portability.andP;  The first one of these isthe PowerTrip, a cube slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes (you rememberwhat a pack of cigarettes looks like, right), which plugs into a car'scigarette lighter and gives you 100 Watts of 110 VAC (standard house current)for your troubles.andP;  This is enough power to handle most of the laptops on themarket today, a printer, a fax machine, or a piece or two of test equipment.andO;Another product which they were also showing was the Laptop Car Scat.andP;  Whilenot required like a baby scat, it still makes sense if you are going to beusing a laptop in the car for any length of time.andM;CMS Enhancements (1372 Valencia Avenue, Tustin, CA 92680; 714-259-9555) whohas been building hard disk drives for the Macintosh world for some time, hasnow become interested in the Laptop market.andP;  At Comdex/Spring, they wereshowing quite a line of products for laptops including Zenith, Compaq, Tandy,Epson, Sharp, and the Macintosh.andP;  Devices offered include 5.25 inch externaldisk drives, internal hard disk systems in both 20 and 40 MB configurations,external hard disk drives in the 100+ MB category, and even a 2400 baud modemwith FAX.andP;  CMS has entered the laptop accessory market in a big way and iftheir products are as good in this field has they have proven to be in theMacintosh world, they should do very well.andM;Toshiba got into the add-in and add-on fray with several products.andP;  The firstis a tape back-up unit designed and built by Mountain Computer, Inc. Themodel TD80 is a 3.5 inch tape backup using the QIC80 format and standard 3MDC2120 tapes to provide up to 124 MB of hard disk back-up.andP;  Priced at justover $1000, the unit is now available and includes a pre-formatted tape andthe back-up software required.andM;The second product, billed as the first internal cellular modem, has beendesigned to fit into a wide range of Toshiba's laptop and portable computerproducts.andP;  The model T24D/X offers state-of-the-art technology in errorcorrection and data compression, providing error free transmission at up to9600 bps over both land line and cellular circuits.andP;  The unit mountsinternally in the T1000SE, XE, T1200, T1200XE, T1600, T3100SX, and theT3200SX machines, and is Hayes compatible at 2400 baud.andP;  It will be availablein late 1990.andM;Toshiba also introduced the T24A/F9600 bps Group 3 fax modem with 2400 bpsHayes phone modem compatibility thrown in for good measure.andP;  This modem isshipped complete with a Windows-based fax application program which permitsusers to compose fax messages, import word processing and ASCII text files,or PCX and TIF graphic files.andP;  This modem, which is available for a widerrange of Toshiba products including the T8500 desktop, will also be availablelate in the year.andM;Comdex ConclusionandM;There are many, many more products which caught our eye at Comdex/Spring andwe will feature more of them in the next issue.andP;  As you can see, the show wasfar from boring and dead.andP;  Maybe we have come to expect that there willalways be a new wiz-bang gadget at each of these shows and when one does notappear, we feel let down and tend to pan the entire show.andM;From our perspective, it was a good show.andP;  There were lots of very goodproducts, the industry is alive and well, and everyone on the floor islooking forward to the last half of 1990 being just as good, if not betterthan the first half.andP;  Considering that this was supposed to be a bad year forthe industry, we should have more bad years like this one.andM;So Comdex/Spring is not dead, it will be back next year and you can bet thatit will be bigger and better than ever.andP;  In the meantime, it is not too earlyto start getting ready for Comdex/Fall (November 12-16), the granddaddy ofall the shows.andP;  We will be preparing a special pre-Comdex issue for this one,and are looking forward to more, better, faster, spiffier, smaller, lighter,more efficient, cheaper products than ever before.andM;Comdex may not be the end-all of trade shows, but it certainly sets thestandards and the pace for those that follow.andP;  The Interface Group has itdown to a science-and it shows.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
