The news program Telexpress said there are about 50 East Germansin the embassy, according to unofficial figures.   It broadcast pictures of the refugees in the embassy courtyard,including children at play.   ``Not long ago this building was under a siege of Poles seekingvisas. After Budapest and Prague, East German escapees are seekingshelter in the West German Embassy in Warsaw,'' the news programsaid.   It was referring to East Germans who this summer occupied WestGerman missions in Hungary and Czechoslovakia in hopes of being ableto emigrate to the West.   Risking censure from its Warsaw Pact allies and courting praisefrom the West, Hungary has opened its borders and allowed more than10,000 East Germans to cross into Austria. Most have headed for WestGermany.   But in Czechoslovakia, about 250 of 400 refugees holed up in theembassy compound gave up Tuesday and left after being promised theywould not be punished and would be allowed to apply to emigratelegally.   Polish media have reported on the exodus, but there has been nocomment from Poland's government, the first East bloc administrationled by non-communists. Hungary also is pressing for major reforms,but East German remains one of the most rigidly controlled statesand refuses to consider demands for change sweeping the communistworld.</TEXT></DOC>
