(``proposed respondents''). The proposed consent orders have been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreementsor make final the agreements' proposed orders. Description of Complaint A complaint prepared for issuance by the Commission along with the threeproposed orders alleges that the three proposed respondents agreed to refuseto participate in the New York State Employees Prescription Program. Thecomplaint alleges that the agreement coerced the State of New York intoraising the prices paid to pharmacies. More specifically, the complaintalleges the following facts. Brooks Drug, Inc. operates a chain of drug stores, including approximately60 stores in New York State. Carl's Drug Co., Inc. operates a chain ofdrug stores, including approximately 42 stores in New York State. GenoveseDrug Stores, Inc. operates a chain of drug stores, including approximately72 stores in New York State. In 1986, each proposed respondent was a memberof the Chain Pharmacy Association of New York State (``Chain Association'').Customers often receive prescriptions through health benefit programs underwhich third-party payers compensate the pharmacy according to a predeterminedformula. Pharmacies that participate in such programs accept the reimbursementoffered by the third-party payer as full payment for dispensing prescriptiondrugs. The New York State Employees Prescription Program is a prescriptiondrug benefit plan that covers approximately 500,000 beneficiaries. In 1986,proposed respondents participated in many prescription drug benefit plans,including the Employees Prescription Program as it existed prior to July1. The complaint alleges that, in May 1986, New York State solicited pharmaciesto participate in the Employees Prescription Program under terms that wouldgo into effect on July 1, 1986. The terms offered were generally lowerthan the terms pharmacies were receiving under the existing program. Theproposed respondents purchased prescription drugs at an average cost thatwas below the level of reimbursement that was offered. Each proposed respondentwould have suffered a loss of customers if its competitors had participatedin the program at a time when it was not participating. The complaint alleges that during or before March 1986, the Chain Associationinformed proposed respondents of the proposed terms of the Employees PrescriptionProgram. The Chain Association told members that it would have a difficulttime opposing the terms of the proposed program if members were signedup to participate in the program. The Chain Association held meetings atwhich some members stated that they would not participate in the EmployeesPrescription Program. Many of these competitors also discussed their decisionsnot to participate in the program outside of Chain Association meetings.The complaint further alleges that through these exchanges of informationand other acts, proposed respondents agreed among themselves and with othersto refuse to participate in the Employees Prescription Program to coercethe State of New York to increase the level of reimbursement under theprogram. The complaint alleges that the agreement to refuse to participate in theprogram injured consumers in New York by reducing competition among pharmacyfirms with respect to third-party prescription plans. Furthermore, proposedrespondents' boycott forced New York State to pay substantial additionalsums for prescription drugs provided to beneficiaries of the EmployeesPrescription Program. Description of the Proposed Consent Orders The three proposed orders would require each of the proposed respondentsto cease and desist from entering into any agreement among pharmacy firmsto withdraw from or refuse to enter into any participation agreement. Theproposed orders would also prohibit each of the proposed respondents, fora period of ten years, from communicating to any pharmacy firm the proposedrespondent's decision or intention to enter into or refuse to enter intoany participation agreement. The proposed orders would also prohibit eachproposed respondent, for a period of eight years, from advising any pharmacyfirm with respect to entering into or refusing to enter into any participationagreement. The orders would not prohibit proposed respondents from: (a) Petitioningthe government on matters involving legislation, rules or procedures; (b)jointly undertaking with other pharmacy firms to provide prescription drugservices so long as the third party payer requests in writing that theproposed respondents do so; or (c) making truthful and nondeceptive publicstatements about existing or proposed participation agreements. The orders would require each proposed respondent to distribute a copyof the order to certain employees and others, to file compliance reports,to retain certain documents, and to notify the Commission of certain changesin its corporate structure. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the threeproposed orders, and is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreements and proposed orders or to modify their terms in any way.The proposed consent orders have been entered into for settlement purposesonly, and do not constitute an admission by any of the proposed respondentsthat the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
