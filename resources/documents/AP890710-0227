Simply stated, blisters happen when your feet sweat and the sweathas nowhere to go. Natural fibers that absorb perspiration but don'tmove it away from your skin leave your feet moist, soft, andvulnerable to the friction you naturally get from walking orrunning. And since the insides of your shoes also will be warm andairless, you'll be a walking culture medium for fungus.   Several manufacturers of sports socks are using an updatedversion of an old standby, Orlon, to counter these problems. Themakers _ ThorLo, Burlington, SAI and Ridgeview _ worked with DuPontin developing Ultratech Orlon, a fiber that they say wicks moistureaway from the wearer at least three times faster than cotton.</TEXT></DOC>
