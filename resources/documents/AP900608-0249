The 33-state task force is asking the National Conference onState Legislatures to standardize licensing, unify state-federal andinterstate regulations, and consider reciprocal shipping agreementsbetween states.   ``Complying with (the) staggering array of state and federalregulation tests the stamina of every American wine producer,'' taskforce chairman Dominic L. Cortese said Friday.   The task force's recommendations, released this week after a yearof hearings, attempt to deal with barriers created with ProhibitionRepeal in 1933, when the states were permitted to retain elements ofthat 14-year experiment as they saw fit.   The task force, noting that 43 states make wine from the grapesproduced by 8,000 grape growers, said the wine industry ``is one ofthe most heavily regulated industries in the United States.''   ``As a grower of grapes, the wine producer is subject to allagricultural regulation. As a producer of wine he or she is subjectto alcohol regulation at both the federal and state level,'' thetask force report said.   ``Each state has its own comprehensive set of regulations. Eachstate has its own bewildering laws regarding wine, and no two stateshave the same laws. The federal government has its own comprehensiveset of regulations. As a result, wine is one of the few productswhere interstate sales are spoken of in terms of `import' and`export.'''   The trade barriers between the states, said the task force, ``arebad for business and employment. They steal the competitive edge andultimately are bad for the state and national economies.''   Above all, said the lawmakers, a joint committee should be formed``with the liquor administrators to review the uniformity of lawsamong the states and make recommendations regarding policies thatcould be adopted by all the states.''   Since the 21st amendment told the states they could make theirown licensed beverage laws, the federal government would not beinvolved in much of what the wine task force hopes to accomplish,said Cortese, who also chairman of the state Assembly SelectCommittee on California Wine Production and Economy.   The recommendations are the product of four hearings in Tulsa,Okla.; Santa Fe, New Mex.; Sacramento, Calif., and Boise, Idaho. Thegeneral membership of the NCSL, made up of state lawmakers, willvote on them in August in Nashville, Tenn.   The U.S. wine industry accounts for 250,000 jobs and $12 billionin retail sales annually, according to the California Wine Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
