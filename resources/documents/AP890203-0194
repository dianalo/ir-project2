PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of the American Bar Association saidFriday he has asked Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to recommenda federal waiting period for the purchase of firearms, sayingloopholes in gun laws make it easy to buy semiautomatic weapons.   Robert Raven, a San Francisco attorney and president of anorganization that represents 350,000 lawyers nationwide, said at anews conference that the growing civilian use of military assaultweapons has focused attention on ``a problem which our nation cannotafford to ignore.'' The association is meeting this weekend inDenver.   He cited the recent slaying of five schoolchildren and woundingof 30 others in Stockton, Calif., and a shooting last week at aWashington, D.C., school in which four were wounded.   Raven said that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 gives Thornburghthe power to develop and begin a federal system to identifypotential purchasers of handguns who are ineligible by federal lawto own firearms.   ``We urge you to conduct the necessary study and swiftly completeyour recommendations, and we specifically urge you to recommend afederal waiting period prior to the purchase of firearms,'' he wrotein his Feb. 2 letter to Thornburgh. In the letter, Raven did notrecommend a time frame for a waiting period.   Raven said he has not heard from Thornburgh, but that he hopes totalk with him Saturday when the attorney general is scheduled toattend the meeting.   Raven said recent reports indicate the number of assault riflesales has risen from 4,000 in 1985 to nearly 40,000 last year.   He said there is a ``glaring loophole in federal gun laws'' thathas created easy public access to the assault weapons, which can beeasily modified to be fully automatic.   ``This problem is not going to go away on its own. After theStockton incident, people flocked to gun shops to buy AK-47lookalikes or other semiautomatic military weapons,'' he said.   ``Just last week, a gunman opened fire on 200 students at aWashington, D.C., school, wounding four. Our nation must takeimmediate action to put an end to such gun-related violence.''   Also Friday, former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hartaddressed the conference and urged lawyers to support a nationalcommunity service program. He said it would replace student loanprograms with a program that requires two to four years of communityservice in return for a college education.</TEXT></DOC>
