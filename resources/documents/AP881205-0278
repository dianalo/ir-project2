The United States has import quotas on sugar and on dairyproducts such as butter and cheese. It also limits imports of beeffrom nations such as Australia and New Zealand through ``voluntary''restraint agreements.   The United States will spend about $13 billion in the coming yearfor subsidies to farmers through price supports, export subsidiesand other programs.   Although that level of support is about half of recent levels,the drop is the result of a recent rise in world food prices, notfundamental reform. Costs would shoot back up if plentiful worldharvests depressed world prices.   The most conspicuous example of protectionism is on sugar, wheredomestic producers with strong clout in Washington have managed toobtain approval of import quotas that keep prices high byrestricting the supply.   Because of quotas, American consumers pay about twice theprevailing world price for sugar.   This is not a rough estimate: On the Coffee, Sugar andamp; CocoaExchange in New York, the bulk price for sugar for January deliveryis currently 11 cents a pound outside the United States and 22 centsa pound inside the United States.   In addition to hurting U.S. consumers, the import quotas hurtsugar exporters such as the Philippines, the Dominican Republic andBrazil, which need the dollars in part to pay interest on loans fromU.S. banks.   ``We're basically shutting these countries, most of which arefriendly and dependent on us, from our market,'' said Dale Hathaway,a former undersecretary of agriculture.   The European Economic Community has more extensive protection andsubsidies of farmers than the United States does.   But Japan, which Americans often regard as highly protectioniston agriculture, will have a fairly open market after a recentliberalization of beef and citrus imports goes into effect. Ricewill be the only remaining food that Japan heavily protects.   ``You're dealing with an area where there are no puritans, onlysinners,'' said Hathaway, a member of the International PolicyCouncil on Agriculture and Trade.</TEXT></DOC>
