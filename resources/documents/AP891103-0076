Thecorrupted socialism in our country is just getting new clothes,that's all.''   ``I don't believe that anything will change there,'' saidanother young man. ``The reforms are only for the outside world.''   Red Cross workers and refugees unloaed tents and bedding truckedin from West Germany.   East Germany has agreed to let its citizens here renounce theircitizenship and then go to West Germany, where they areautomatically granted citizenship.   But with East German diplomats processing only about 100applications a day, it was feared the embassy and its gardens,which have a capacity of about 5,500 people, would be overflowingby the weekend when a rush of new arrivals was expected.   Embassy sources, who put the number of East Germans at about4,000 just before noon, said negotiations were under way withCzechoslovak authorities for more space.   Some people arriving today said the roads to Prague were crammedwith East German cars.   The wave began Wednesday after East Germany's new leader, EgonKrenz, lifted a month-old travel ban to Czechoslovakia, the onlycountry East Germans can visit freely. Krenz's predecessor, ErichHonecker, had imposed the ban to stop an earlier exodus of EastGermans to the West German Embassy in Prague.   The exodus has mainly involved skilled workers in their early20s and 30s. At least 200 to 300 children played inside the embassygrounds.   Those who have left East Germany include at least 1,100 doctorsand nurses, and this has severely strained health services in theCommunist country, an East German health officials said today.   Dr. Geerd Dellas, the health administrator for the city of EastBerlin, said doctors and nurses from exclusive clinics servinghigh-ranking Communist officials have been drafted to work inordinary hospitals. Nurses still in school who were near graduationhave also been employed, Dellas said.   East Germans were swift to take advantage of the lifting of thetravel ban. Eight thousand crossed into Czechoslovakia in the first24 hours, and the number in the West German Embassy swelled from2,100 Thursday night to some 4,000 by noon today.   ``You've just got to use an open barn door to the West while youcan,'' said one 25-year-old from Leipzig.   Most refugees simply walked in through the giant wooden doors ofthe Palais Lobkowicz, the elegant Baroque palace that houses theWest German Embassy in Prague's ancient Mala Strana district.   A Czech policeman outside the embassy said he and his colleagueshad orders not to interfere because it was a matter for the twoGermanys alone.   The West German government appealed to East Germany to speed upthe bureaucratic process for the East Germans in Prague and about700 still waiting at the West German mission in Warsaw, Poland.   East Germany said it was working as fast as possible andreiterated that it would be better for its citizens to apply forlegal emigration.   East Germans complain that it often takes years for a suchrequests to be granted.   Since August, more than 70,000 East Germans have fled theirhomeland through Hungary and Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw.   On Oct. 3, Honecker banned travel to Czechoslovakia to try tohalt the exodus of young, skilled workers badly needed in hislabor-intensive economy.   But the exodus and pressure for reform led to Honecker's ousterOct. 18. He was replaced by Krenz, who is trying to bolster theCommunist Party's sagging authority with promises of reform andforeign travel.   Krenz faces mounting pressure for democratic reform in EastGermany, where tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to thestreets to press for more democracy.   Returning from Poland on Thursday, Krenz urged closer economicties to the West. Several top Communist officials resigned,including Honecker's wife, Margot, as education minister.</TEXT></DOC>
