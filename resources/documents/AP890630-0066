Bilzerian has snaredbillionaire shopping center and sports magnate Edward J. DeBartoloSr.   In a sweeping Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit,DeBartolo, Bilzerian and three others were charged Thursday withconcealing investments to mask planned takeovers, manipulating stockprices or trading on inside information in seven deals from 1985through 1988.   The suit seeks to recover more than $34 million in illegalprofits, making it one of the largest civil cases ever involvingcorporate takeovers.   The 70-year-old DeBartolo _ the nation's largest developer ofshopping malls _ and an associate agreed to pay more than $3 millionto settle the charges with the SEC, without admitting guilt.   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.,seeks $31.3 million in allegedly fraudulent profits from Bilzerian,who already faces a lengthy prison term and fines for a criminalfraud conviction June 9.   The suit also details for the first time alleged illegal stocktransactions in Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover last year ofSinger Co., the sewing machine company turned defense contractor.Later Thursday, Bilzerian resigned as chairman and chief executiveof Singer.   ``In numerous situations he engaged in the same kinds ofviolations time and time again of the disclosure requirements,''said SEC Associate Enforcement Director William McLucas.   Bilzerian's lawyer, Arthur F. Mathews, said his client wouldfight the charges in court.   The suit alleges Bilzerian lied about or failed to properlydisclose to the SEC in October 1987 the source of at least $8million in borrowed money he used to buy Singer stock. It maintainsBilzerian later borrowed another $6 million in a Singer stock saleagreement he never disclosed.   Bilzerian also was charged with disclosure violations inconnection with stock purchases in Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc. andFortune Financial Group Inc.   The lawsuit also alleges Bilzerian violated financial disclosurerequirements or attempted to conceal stock ownership involvingCluett, Peabody andamp; Co., Hammermill Paper Co. and H.H. Robertson Co.,and a stock transaction in Armco Inc., in 1985 and 1986.   Those four transactions formed the basis of Bilzerian's criminalconviction, which was an indirect spinoff from the Ivan Boeskyinsider trading case.   DeBartolo agreed to pay about $2.7 million in alleged illegalprofits to settle charges involving the Cluett and Hammermilltakeovers. DeBartolo owns the National Hockey League's PittsburghPenguins and the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers andhas a net worth of $1.4 billion, according to Forbes magazine.   His company, the Youngstown, Ohio-based Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.Corp., was not charged.   William D. Moses, the company's senior vice president foroperations, and Richard S. Sokolov, its general counsel, werecharged with helping Bilzerian misrepresent the source of funds andwith entering into an undisclosed transaction in one deal.   Moses also was charged with one insider trading count. He agreedto pay $205,000 in alleged illegal profits and $129,000 in fines.Sokolov was not required to pay any amount as part of his settlementwith the SEC.   ``The settlement was entered into in order to avoid protractedlitigation and to permit DeBartolo, Moses and Sokolov to devote fullattention to their business affairs,'' a company statement said.   The fifth defendant in the case, who has not settled, is David A.Tallant, a California lawyer who managed some Bilzerian trusts.   A federal jury in Manhattan found Bilzerian, 39, of Tampa, Fla.,guilty of nine felony counts of violating securities and tax lawsduring four transactions. He faces up to five years in jail and$250,000 in fines on each criminal count and is appealing theconviction.</TEXT></DOC>
