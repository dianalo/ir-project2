Michael A. Feaster, 30, was indicted on a total of 41 countsinvolving six children by a District of Columbia Superior Courtgrand jury.   He surrendered to police Wednesday night and is being held in thecity jail on $200,000 bond. He will be arraigned Thursday.   Feaster's attorney, Duff Lewis, said the U.S. attorney's officewas seeking to create ``a mass hysteria over the AIDS virus.''   According to the indictment, Feaster abused the children, betweenthe ages of 9 and 15, from June 1987 until February of this year.   Feaster was charged with three counts of assault with a dangerousweapon for incidents which allegedly occurred between November 1988and February 1989, after he tested positive for the HIV virus, theindictment stated.   The indictment said Feaster assaulted the boy ``with dangerousweapons'' by having sex with him at after having tested positive forAIDS.   Georgetown University law professor Robert Stein said the chargewas unusual.   ``It is unusual, but there are a number of examples of people whohave had sex with others knowing they were infected who, under statelaws, have been brought to trial. In a couple of cases, includingone in the military in a court-martial, they were convicted,'' Steinsaid.   The indictment caused concern among some close to AIDS victims.   ``If we have our law enforcement agencies in the country nowbeginning to define AIDS as a lethal weapon, then all of our effortsat educating people and encouraging people to come forward and betested and receive treatment as early as possible, could seriouslyby hampered by something like this,'' said Robert Harvey of theWhitman-Walker Clinic, a major AIDS treatment facility in theWashington area.</TEXT></DOC>
