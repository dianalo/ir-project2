We have absolutely nothing to do withPanama, nor with the Panamanian government.''   ``We have never received any money from Panamanian sources,'' hesaid.   Calero's comments, in an interview after appealing to aconvention of U.S. conservatives to send donations to his cause,was his first reaction to congressional testimony on Wednesday by aformer top Panamanian intelligence officer, Jose I. Blandon.   Blandon told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that Panamaprovided military training for the rebels after a 1985 request fromthen-White House aide Oliver North. At the time, direct U.S.assistance to the rebels was banned by law.   In addition, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanianmilitary leader whose ouster the Reagan administration is urging,said last week that he and another former White House aide, JohnPoindexter, discussed the possibility of a U.S. invasion ofNicaragua. U.S. government spokesmen have denied such talks tookplace.   Asked if he thought Noriega, who was indicted last week by agrand jury on drug charges, fabricated the story about invasionplans to divert attention from his current fight with the UnitedStates, Calero replied: ``Yes, he's the one in hot water.''   The testimony by Blandon and the comments by Noriega have raisedseveral questions, including: Was the United States using Panama tohelp the Nicaraguan rebels at a time direct U.S. assistance wasoutlawed?''   Also at issue is the relationship between the United States andNoriega, who has now been accused of criminality by a grand jury.According to Blandon's testimony, the CIA gave Noriega classifiedreports on anti-Reagan administration senators.   The CIA denied the allegation, but Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-NY,said ``the fact of the matter is that it has been well know thatNoriega _ the thug and racketeer _ has been on the payroll of theCIA for many years and remained there, I am given to understand,until rather recently.''   In his speech to the annual Conservative Political ActionConference, Calero lamented anew congressional rejection of anadministration request for $36.2 million in aid for the Nicaraguanresistance.   He solicited private donations, but said ``private supportcannot substitute for U.S. government aid.''   ``However, we do need private support of a humanitarian, ornon-lethal nature,'' Calero said.   The Reagan administration, whose solicitation of private fundsfor the Contras in previous years created a huge furor, haspublicized a White House memo ordering officials to take no part inprivate fund raising.   Calero said the vote against Contra aid will force theresistance forces to reduce their activities in the coming year,but he added, ``We will continue the struggle no matter what.''   Opponents of the U.S. government assistance said it would harm apeace plan signed by Nicaragua and other governments in the region.</TEXT></DOC>
