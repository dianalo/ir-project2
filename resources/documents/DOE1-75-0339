Patients with hip pain wereinitially evaluated by plain radiographs of the pelvis and hips. If nodiagnosis was reached, the hips were studied for effusions by real-timehip ultrasonography. If an effusion was present, the joint was aspiratedfor diagnosis. If no effusion was present by US or if no diagnosis wasreached by aspiration, triple phase radionuclide bone scans were performed.Fifty patients were evaluated by this prospective protocol, and the diagnosiswas reached in 48 of the 50 cases (10 by plain radiographs, 16 by US,and aspiration of the joint, and 22 by triple phase bone scans). Hipeffusions were found in 20 patients by US, with no false positives orfalse negatives. Previous studies for detecting effusions by US haveemphasized absolute measurements of the capsular width, but we reporta typical appearance of the hip capsule when fluid is present (a bulgingconvex capsule). When no effusion is present, the capsule is concaveand parallels the long axis of the femoral neck.</TEXT></DOC>
