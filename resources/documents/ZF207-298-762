And what about Multimatc,your Intel- based word processor?)andM;There is plenty of life left in the other two platforms (286 and 8086) but,again, Intel does not control the manufacture of these chips in the same wayit does in thc 80386 and above, world.andP;  I do not, for a moment, believe thatit will let thc 80 386 get out of its control.andM;All-in -all it was a banner day for Intel and it is clear that they wanteveryone to move to the platforms for which they are the only supplier.andM;On with the showandM;While at thc show, we kept hearing the same thing: &quot;boring, nothing new, andnothing to get excited about&quot;.andP;  My take on this event is somewhat different.andM;First, I agree that there was no show stopper, but I do not agree that it wasa boring show.andP;  My reasons: a whole new group of 80386 systems, some of whichwere very sporty 386SX units, a lot of 33 Mhz systems, and even a widevariety of 386 AT size boards designed to be used as drop-in replacements for8088 and 80286-based motherboards, were on display.andM;Next came the graphics cards and monitors.andP;  Almost every corner of the floorwas crammed with various EGA, VGA and beyond, offerings.andP;  This is a very goodsign.andP;  The more competition found in the video marketplace, the more downwardpressure will be exerted on the products.andM;Western Digital was talking to all who would listen about its 8514Acompatible chip set which, it claims, will help drive thc 8514 displaystandard.andM;Laser printer prices are coming down.andP;  Several vendors offered 400 dpisystems for under $7,000, including NewGen, which has several emulation modesincluding the RIPS implementation of PostScript.andP;  RIPS, by thc way, was verymuch in evidence at thc Xerox booth where a number of vendors wcre showingfontware and utilities for Xcrox Ventura Publisher.andP;  (RIPS, 4665 NautilusCourt South, Boulder, CO 80301, 303-530-2910.)andM;One of my experiences at the show was to be targeted by Compaq,Hewlett-Packard, and AST as an &quot;anti-EISA bus person&quot; who is very much inneed of EISA evangelism.andP;  I must admit that Compaq, under the direction ofMike Swavely, is very persuasive in its pitch.andP;  Once I finally understoodwhat I was being told, I felt somewhat better about EISA, but am stilluncomfortable about its implementation.andM;There are so many claims and counterclaims about 1) The RFI (radio frequencyinterference) problems which will or will not manifest themselves via theEISA bus and connectors.andP;  2) Thc spccd and capabilities of thc EISA bus vs.andO;those of the Micro Channel bus.andP;  What I did learn, was that the MCA system isjust that, a system.andP;  The EISA, on the other hand is only part of a system,in that it only controls input and output devices, while the MCA controlsinput and output devices, and multiprocessors.andP;  According to Compaq, EISAwill permit the use of bus master cards but the REAL implementation formultiprocessors will not be on this bus at all but rather above the bus andin conjunction with the 32-bit memory bus for which EISA docs not includestandards.andP;  It is possible that each EISA vendor will implement this otherbus differently.andM;On one hand, I feel better - Compaq, et al.andP;  will not attempt to runmultiproccssors on thc EISA bus.andP;  However, I am still confused and concernedabout standards.andP;  I was told by Compaq, HP, and AST that there would bc nostandards for implementing multiprocessor control, but rather each individualcompany could use its own discretion.andP;  Does this mean that you are &quot;trapped&quot;by the CPU vendor when it comes to adding co-proccssors?andM;This seems just as contrary to me as the EISA followers believe IBM is withits MCA architecture.andP;  Each appears to be trying to control a piece of themarket and not giving the end-user any choices.andM;All three companies promised announcement and availability of an EISA box bythe end of the year and all three said the same thing: the firstimplementation of EISA will be in the high-end and high speed 80386 world andmaybe even into the i486 world.andP;  Regardless of all this, we will just have towait and see what happens.andP;  How the CPU bus is implemented by each companyand what the ramifications are remains to be seen.andM;Best of showandM;I always enjoy walking the aisles and seeing the smaller companies withproducts which have not found their way into the main stream of the market(and may never).andP;  This year the show was divided into halls.andP;  The main hall,where IBM was the central exhibitor, was also the place one found MacDexduring the first day.andP;  By the beginning of day two, the pipes and draperieswhich had been separating MacDex from Comdex had disappeared and thc entirefloor was, once again, one big exhibit area.andM;For all of the i386 machines on the floor, the product of the show, for me,was the Keestick, a keyboard joystick (Sal Perez, 5850 Cypress GArdens, Blvd,Winter Haven, FL, 33884, (813)3240519).andP;  This ingenious little device sellsfor only a few dollars and turns any keypad with cursor keys, into ajoystick.andP;  Simple in its design, the device sticks onto the &quot;5&quot; key and hasfingers which extend out to touch thc 8, 2, 4 and 6 keys.andP;  A swivel stickscrews into the top of the device and a joystick is born! I brought my samplehome, installed it on my AT, and found that it works well with any programwhich uses the numeric keypad for cursor movement.andM;PortfolioandM;Next, Atari (Atari Computer, 1196 Borregas Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA, 94088-3427,(408) 745-2000) was showing two new entries under glass and for futuredelivery.andP;  Each of them is a spiffy new product and if either comes to marketit may, in Fact, help Atari gain market share in the main stream computingworld.andP;  The first of the two, scheduled for shipment in June, is its vcrsionof a handheld DOS compatible system, called the Portfolio.andM;This &quot;pocket&quot; computer's specs are impressive.andP;  Using the Intel 80C88 CPUrunning at 4.92 Mhz, it is about the size of a VCR tape, with a starting listprice of $400.andP;  Other specifications for thc systcm include MS-DOS 2.11compatibility, 128K of RAM standard (expandable to 640K), six credit- cardsized 32K or 128KRAMcards, a port to use for file exchange with a desktop PC,and a 63key,IBM-compatible keyboard.andM;The display is an 8-line by 40 character LCD, and the systcm measures 7.8 X4.1 X 12 inches.andP;  Power is furnished by standard AA batteries, and, accordingto Atari, they will power the machine for over a month with only threebatteries.andM;The software (firmware) includes an appointment calendar with alarms, anaddress/phone list (complete with autodial), a text processor, with line andcolumn counters, and a Lotus 1 -2- 3 file compatible spreadsheet.andP;  Optionsinclude a &quot;smart cable&quot; for transferring information between desktopcomputers and the Portfolio, and an external card drive which can be attachedto any PC.andM;StacyandM;Atari is also entering the laptop markct with the &quot;Stacy&quot;, an ST compatiblelaptop weighing in at 15.2 pounds with dimensions of 13.3&quot; high X 15&quot; wide X13.3&quot; deep (missing the all important airline tray table dimension criteriaby 1.3&quot;).andP;  Atari will be selling this machine starting in the summer for$1495 (thc floppy-only version) and $1995 (the unit equipped with a 20megabyte hard disk.)andM;Specifications are: Motorola 68COOO CPU running at 8 Mhz, IMB of RAM plus 32Kof static screen RAM, Internal ROM 256K, Supertwist LCD monochrome display(backlit LCD optional) with 640 X 400 pixel resolution, full functionST-compatible keyboard with 10 function keys, track ball, and two &quot;mouse&quot;keys.andP;  Other features includc: internal batteries (5 to 35 hours projectedusc), monitor, serial, MIDI, parallel, floppy, hard disk, and game port(Atari's specs list both a serial and RS232C port but whcn asked, theyindicated that this was thc same port!).andM;Perhaps the nicest feature of this machinc is its ability to run both MS-DOSand Apple Macintosh software just as the desktop ST computers do.andP;  By use ofa plug-in card, the system &quot;thinks&quot; that it is a Macintosh or with softwareonly, it becomes an MS-DOS computer.andP;  Thc demonstration we saw running Excelfor the Macintosh was very impressive - booting time for the program wasunder 8 seconds.andM;We still question Atari's ability to markct systcms into corporate America,but both of these offerings should help move them in that direction.andM;Speaking of Apple's Macintosh, Powder Blue Computers, Inc.andP;  (PO Box 576,Sandy, Utah, 84091, (801) 5303739) showed three different &quot;MacintoshCompatible&quot; computers: the BlueMAQ II, the IIX, and the CEO.andP;  Each of theseis housed in an AT style case, but runs a 68030 CPU - thc II and the IIX at16 Mhz and thc CEO at 33 Mhz.andM;The specifications includc hard drices in each model (the II sports a 65 Mbdrive with 28 ms access, thc IIX an 85 Mb drive with similar access time, andthe CEO has both a 360 Mb disk (no access time specified) and a 45 Mbremovable unit.andM;Other variations in the specifications include thc 3.5&quot; floppy drives: 800KMacintosh compatible only on the II, Mac and MS-DOS compatible on the othertwo, video resolution of 1050 X 770 on the II and the IIX and 1280 X 960 onthe CEO.andP;  The keyboard is thc Datadesk 101 extended 101 key unit, and theinput/output connectors include SCSI, scrial, printer, modem, mouse, video,and audio output.andM;BlueMAQ computers usc Applc ROM/BIOS, purchased through authorized Applerepair facilities.andP;  BluciMAQ stated that they intend to provide their ownversion of thc ROM/ BIOS once they have been assured that they won't be inviolation of Apple's Copyrights.andP;  The machines offer some very nice additionsover the standard Apple offerings, including full DOS and Mac support on boththc IIX and CEO.andP;  Howevcr, because they are the first vcndor to challengeApple head on with a MAC clone, they are probably a good company to adopt a&quot;wait and see&quot; attitude  about.andM;Other CPU happeningsandM;All of the typical players (IBM, Compaq, AST, Epson, Wyse, Tandy, et al)were, of course, showing off their 80386 wares, but the floor was also filledto overflowing with board makers.andP;  Some of these are designed to be used toupgrade existing 8088 and 80286 systcms, and some of them arc for thc &quot;rollyour own&quot; competer market.andM;American Megatrends, Inc.andP;  (1346 Oakbrook Drive, Suite 120, Norcross, GA,30093, (404)263-8181), was showing its 386 motherboard running at 33 Mhzwhile announcing plans for a board based on the i486 chip.andM;AMI claims this is the fastest 386 board on the market because of acombination of Intel's 33 Mhz 386 processor and its own proprietary high-speed, on-board eache controller.andP;  It has 64 Kb of 20ns static RAM which canbuffer up to 16 Mb of 6 Ons dynamic RAM with zero wait state.andP;  In additionthc board supports both the Intel 387 and the Weitek 3167 math co-processorsand permits up to 16 Mb of RAM on the motherboard.andP;  AMI's boards feature itsown BIOS which includesset-up, diagnostics, and shadow RAM features.andM;Wave Mate, Inc.andP;  (2341 205th Street, Suite 110, Torrance, CA, 90501, (213)533-8190), is also in thc CPU board business.andP;  At thc show it had its fullline of products on display including: The Bullet-386 series which includesAT style boards running at 16, 20, 25 Mhz speeds; the Bullet-386 SX series 16Mhz, zero wait state; and the Bullet-286 AT series running at 10,12.5, and 16Mhz, also with zero wait states.andP;  List prices range from $249 for a 7.2 Mhz286/XT board with OK of RAM to $9945 for a 25 Mhz board with 2 Mb of RAM.andM;There were, of course, many other board makers on the floor as well, but theywere all offering about the same products as described above.andM;What do you do with all of thcsc motherboards if you are not changing out asystem? If you are a VAR or reseller, you purchase the boards and build yourown system.andP;  If you are a computer literate person or just want to learn howto &quot;roll your own&quot; system the you buy one and find the rest of the pieces andparts to make it into a system.andM;For all thc board makers on the floor, there were an equal number of case,power supply, and parts vendors.andP;  Typical of these is a company called QuickTechnology Corporation (1642 McGaw Avenue, Irvine, CA, 92714,1-800-950-8999).andP;  This company sells a line of cases complete with powersupplies.andP;  Its model Q-1000 is a dcsk-top case with 200 watt power supply,handling three 5/1/4 halfheight drives, and featuring an IDP function displaywhich permits a multitude of functions to be displayed on the system if themotherboard has the proper connectors.andP;  This unit, including the powcrsupply, lists for $156 in single lot quantities.andP;  The model Q-2000 is a minitower with room for three 5 1/4 and one 3.5 inch drives and sells, with powersupply for $183.andP;  The Q-3000 tower handles up to 5 half-height drives withthe power supply and sells for $209.andM;Keyboard-less portableandM;Microslate (926 Victoria Ave, Suite 208 Greenfield Park, QC J4V IM9Canada,514-466-8911) was showing its version of a keyboardless portable.andP;  TheDatallite features a backlit, LCD touchscreen, and is referred to as theToteable.andM;The unit is supposed to be DOS compatible, uses a NEC V-40 processor runningat 8.129 Mhz, and comes standard with 512K of RAM (expandable to 76 8 K) .andO;It has a single 3 .5 inch ,1.44 Mb floppy and an optional external hard disk,a parallel port, serial port, external keyboard connector, and in internal 12volt battery.andP;  The unit weighs 7 pounds and is 12 3/4 X 9 1/2 X 2 1/4 inches.andO;A backlit, supertwist LCD with 640 X 400 is optional, as is an internal 2400baud modem, external printcr, and bar code reader.andP;  The unit is designed tobe used with data entry, menu selection type of software, rather thanstandard off the shelf &quot;normal&quot; DOS software and is aimed at vertical marketssuch as order entry, hospital patient charts, and inventory control.andM;MacDexandM;The vendors taking part in MacDex were, for the most part, very disappointed.andO;Farrallon, a main stream Apple networking company with a very broad line ofproducts, was in MacDex and did not draw nearly the number of people throughits booth as it would have on the main show floor.andM;One of the most interesting products in MacDex was by Sumo Systems (1580 OldOakland Road, Suitc C103, San Jose, CA, 95131,408-453-5744).andP;  The device is arewriteable optical disk with removable media.andP;  The disk, itself, is a Ricohdevice, and has a SCSI interface to the Macintosh (and therefore to the PCworld as well).andP;  Thc specifications and price for this dcvicc make itespecially interesting.andP;  The total storage available is 594 Mb, the accessspeed is 60 ms, and the transfer rate is 1.2 MB/ second.andP;  Coupled with anunder $6000 price tag, this is a device worth noting if you need lots andlots of disk storage.andM;Talking PC'sandM;Electronic mail and voice messaging are also hot topics.andP;  One vendor atComdex: VolLink Corporation (P.O.andP;  Box 23306, Nashville, TN 37202,615-331-0275) was promoting a program to turn Email into voice mail with itscomgination software and hardware system called VoxMail.andP;  The system iscompatible with any E-Mail system using the MHS MTA standard (this includesCoordinator from Action Technologics, Para-Mail from Paradox, DaynaMAIL fromDayna, PC Complete from Transend, and Framework III LAN from Ashton-Tate).andO;The product takes writtcn E-mail messages and converts them to a voice formatfor pick-up via any touch-tone phone.andM;The advantages are obvious: access E-mail while out of the office, or jointhe E-Mail system without having a PC at all.andP;  Thc package comes completewith a phone interface board, text-to-specch board, software, and manuals.andO;Thc demonstration we saw was very good and the voice quality was veryacceptable when you consider the problems associated with converting writtentext to spoken voice.andM;Other products short takesandM;Xircom (22231 Mulholland Highway, Suite 114, Woodland Hills, CA, 818884-8755) displayed its two pocket Ethernet adapters.andP;  One is for thin Ethernetand the other is for external MAU.andP;  Both come standard with 8K of RAM for$695 and a 32K version for $100 more.andP;  In addition to thc RAM for networkbuffering, the systems have 256 bit EEPROMs for configuration storage.andP;  Thedevice is small and connects to any PC compatible system via the parallelport.andM;For years, companies have been selling 12VDC to 11OVAC adapters for use inrecreational vehicles to power TVs, radios and all of the other things that aserious camper cannot leave behind.andP;  Now however, there is also a need toprovide this same type of power for the computers of the world.andP;  Actually, itis somewhat more difficult since computers prefer &quot;cleaner&quot; AC than astandard TV with lots of filtering.andM;Zirco, Inc.andP;  (10900 W.andP;  44th Ave, Wheat Ridge, CO, 80033, 303-4212013) hasentered this market with &quot;Power to Go&quot;, a device which plugs into a cigarettelighter and provides 100 watts of constant, filtered 115VAC power.andP;  There isan on/off switch, lowbattery alarm, and overload protection as well.andP;  Zircoalso makes a product called the Laptop Car Scat which holds your Laptop inthe passenger's seat so you can use it and your cellular phone at 55 MPH!!andO;-Andrew M.andP;
