On April 10, 1989, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'')held a public hearing. The petitioner, a domestic interested party, andthe respondents submitted comments for the record in prehearing briefson April 3, 1989, and in posthearing briefs on April 18, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s). The products covered by this investigation are steel wheels, assembledor unassembled, consisting of both a disc and a rim, designed to be mountedwith both tube type and tubeless pneumatic tires, in wheel diameter sizesranging from 13.0 inches to 16.5 inches, inclusive, and generally for useon passenger automobiles, light trucks, and other vehicles. In 1988, suchmerchandise was classifiable under item number 692.3230 of the Tariff Schedulesof the United States Annotated. This merchandise is currently classifiableunder HTS item number 8708.70.80. The HTS number is provided for convenienceand Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. In our preliminary determination, we stated that ``[f]or purposes of thepreliminary determination, we have treated rims or discs, whether importedseprately or together, as included in the scope of this investigation.''The Department further reviewed information on this issue for this finaldetermination. We verified that during the period of review the only parts of steel wheelsimported from Brazil into the United States were rims. Discs were not imported.The rims imported during the period of investigation (``POI'') are separatelytraded (<T3>i.e., </T3>sold as distinct articles of commerce). These rims are purchasedby unrelated custom wheel manufacturers who combine the rims with non-Braziliandiscs to make custom wheels at their own facilities. The disc and furtherprocessing add significant value to the custom wheel in which the Brazilianrim is only one component. Petitioner initially argued that rims should be included within the scopeof the order to prevent circumvention. The petition described the coveredmerchandise as wheels from Brazil, which included rims and centers forsuch wheels so as to avoid possible circumvention through the shipmentof wheel components rather than finished wheels. In an October 7, 1988letter to the Department, petitioner restated this position with regardto the rim market by asserting that its ``intention was not to includewithin the scope of the imports subject to investigation rims sold as distinctarticles of commerce and, therefore, not in circumvention of an order.Petitioner's concern lies with circumvention.'' In subsequent submissions,petitioner was inconsistent regarding the reasons for including rims inthe scope. We conclude, however, that petitioner's primary concern is circumvention.In past cases where petitioners have raised concerns about circumventionof any resulting order, the Department has specifically included partsin the scope of the investigation because of uncertainty as to the authorityof the Department to include parts subsequent to the publication of anorder where parts are imported to circumvent the order. <T3>See, e.g., Cellular Mobile Telephones from Japan, </T3>(50 FR 42577(1985)). Now, however, section 781 of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988 not only clarifies that the Department has such authority butsets forth the criteria for dealing with this type of circumvention. Therefore,notwithstanding pre-1988 Act administrative precedents, it is not necessaryto include rims in the scope of the proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>Sales of steel wheels to original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs'') accountfor more than 60 percent of the value of imports of the subject merchandiseinto the United States from Brazil. Steel wheels are normally sold to OEMsin the United States on the basis of long-term requirements contracts.We found that shipments to the United States by Rockwell-Fumagalli (``Fumagalli'')during the February 1-July 31, 1988 investigation period were pursuantto agreements executed in November 1986. Therefore, under andSection; 353.38(a)of our regulations, we extended the POI for Fumagalli to seven months byincluding November 1986 as well. <T3>See Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from Japan, </T3>52 FR 17999 (1987)and <T3>Certain Granite Products from Italy, </T3>53 FR 27187 (1988). The POIfor Borlem S.A. Empreendimentos Industriais (``Borlem'') is February 1,1988 through July 31, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of the subject merchandise in the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States pricefor sales of wheels to OEMs with the foreign market value for sales ofwheels to OEMs in Brazil. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>As provided in section 772(b) of the Act, we used purchase price to representthe United States price for sales of steel wheels made by Borlem to anunrelated purchaser prior to importation of the merchandise into the UnitedStates. The Department also determined that purchase price and not exporter's salesprice was the most appropriate indicator of United States price for Fumagallibased on the following elements: 1. The merchandise was purchased or agreed to be purchased prior to thedate of importation from the manufacturer or producer of the merchandisefor exportation to the United States. 2. The selling agent located in the United States acted only as a processorof sales-related documentation and as a communication link with the unrelatedU.S. buyers. 3. The wheels sold to OEMs were made-to-order and not sold through inventory.Although a party related to the seller took title to the wheels and heldthem in its warehouse after the sale was made, this was only to accommodatethe ``just-in-time'' delivery terms stipulated in the requirements contractnegotiated between the Brazilian producer and the U.S. EOM purchaser. Allterms of the sale were settled in this contract and were not changed bythe related party when it released the wheels to the U.S. OEM purchaser.4. Warehousing for ``just-in-time'' delivery was the customary channelof trade for wheels sold by Fumagalli to the U.S. OEM purchaser. We calculated purchase price based on the f.o.b. warehouse, Troy, Michigan,or packed f.o.b. Brazilian factory prices to unrelated purchasers in theUnited States. Where appropriate, we made deductions for brokerage andhandling, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S.duty, and U.S. inland freight. In accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C)of the act, we made additions for indirect taxes not collected by reasonof the exportation of the merchandise. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>We calculated foreign market value for wheel sales by Fumagalli and Borlembased on delivered home market packed prices to unrelated purchasers inaccordance with section 773(a) of the Act. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight and inland insurance.We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. Wemade circumstance of sale adjustments for differences in credit, post-salewarehousing expenses, and indirect taxes between the two markets. In accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act, we made adjustmentsto similar merchandise to account for differences in the physical characteristicsof the merchandise where there were no identical products in the home marketwith which to compare products sold in the United States. These adjustmentswere based on differences in the costs of materials, direct labor and factoroverhead. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>When calculating foreign market value, we normally make currency conversionsin accordance with section 353.56 of our regulations, using the certifiedexchange rates furnished by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Sincethe Federal Reserve Bank of New York stopped providing exchange rate informationfor Brazil prior to the period of this investigation, we used the monthlyexchange rates provided by the International Monetary Fund (``IMF''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received </ITAG>General Comments <T3>Comment 1: </T3>Both the petitioner and the respondents have commentedon the issue of excluding or including rims within the scope of this investigationand the methodology that should be used to establish the foreign marketvalue of this product. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The scope issue is discussed in the sectionon Scope of Investigation. Since the Department determined that rims soldas distinct articles of commerce are not included in the scope of thisinvestigation, comments relating to the Brazilian rim exporter, BorlemDo Nordeste, and fair value comparisons for rims are not addressed in thisnotice. Petitioners' Comments <T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner argues the Department improperly acceptedBorlem's use of the Adiantamento Sobre Contrato De Cambio (``ACC'') interestrate in calculating imputed credit costs on the basis that the ACC rateis a preferential rate which is effectively an export subsidy.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The Department previouslydetermined in <T3>Carbon Steel Plate from Brazil</T3> (48 FR 2568, January 20, 1983)that ACC financing is a program that, although regulated by the BrazilianGovernment, permits Brazilian companies to discount foreign exchange accountsreceivables with private banks at rates established by commercial marketconsiderations. In this case, we verified that the ACC program is stillin effect. The ACC rate was used to impute credit costs on the U.S. sidesince, although Borlem did not discount its export receivables associatedwith the exports under investigation during the POI, the ACC remains themost common means of financing export receivables and, consequently, isa reasonable approximation of export financing expenses.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner faults the difference in merchandise adjustmentreported by Borlem and used by the Department in making fair value comparisonsbetween the home market and export model steel wheels. To begin, the petitionerquestions the fact that the amount of steel input reported for the lighterdomestic wheel is greater than the amount reported for the heavier exportwheel to which it is being compared. Even accepting the difference in merchandiseamount reported, however, petitioner points out an error made by the Departmentin converting cruzados to dollars which significantly understates the dollaramount of the adjustment necessary. Further faults in the adjustment includethe exclusion of financing and inventory carrying costs in the steel replacementcost and the use of a simple average of steel prices for replacement costsduring the month rather than a daily weighted average. Finally, the petitionerstates that the Department was unable to verify the cost or volume of steelinput for the export wheel.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The petitioner misunderstands the costreported for the steel input utilized in the difference in merchandiseadjustment for the domestic wheel model. During the POI, the disc for thisspecific model was produced by Borlem do Nordeste, and the material inputcost reflects both the steel input cost as well as additional disc productioncosts incurred by Borlem do Nordeste. Contrary to petitioner's assertion,in those months where there were two steel prices, the Department verifiedthat Borlem used an appropriately weighted average of the two prices andnot a simple average. Furthermore, since we also verified that Borlem paidlist price for steel, in lieu of actual steel purchases during the monthof March, the Department accepted the list price for that month for theexport model. In verifying the difference in merchandise adjustment, theDepartment verified the weight of the steel input for representative models,including the export model, and is satisfied that the difference in merchandiseadjustment adequately reflects the relative weight of each model. The Department,however, agrees that in converting the difference in merchandise adjustmentfrom cruzados to dollars, an error was made in the conversion resultingin an incorrect dollar amount. This error has been corrected in our finaldetermination. The Department disagrees with petitioner's assertion thatinventory carrying costs and financing costs should be included in a differenceof merchandise adjustment. Cost differences in this calculation are limitedto differences in variable costs of production. Imputed costs are not consideredpart of the Department's difference in merchandise adjustment.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Petitioner argues that the full amount of the ImpostoDe Circulacao De Mercadorias (``ICM'') tax should not have been deductedfrom the cost of materials in calculating U.S. packing expenses since Borlembears the cost of the ICM tax for one to twelve months after paying it.In addition, petitioner argues that Borlem incorrectly excluded ICM andImposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (``IPI'') indirect taxes from itssteel replacement cost calculations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The ICM and IPI taxes Borlempaid on input materials for export products were applied each month ascredits against home market tax liability. Since Borlem has sufficienthome market taxes against which to apply these taxes, there is no lossin value, <T3>i.e.</T3>, additional cost, prior to application of the credits.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department incorrectly ignoreda substantial number of shipments of wheels to the United States. Further,the Department failed to determine how many shipments occurred under contractsprior to the POI and therefore cannot determine whether all relevant shipmentswere reported or whether the shipments that were reported are sufficientlyrepresentative of the total shipments that took place during the relevantperiod.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. We confirmed at verificationthat shipments made by Borlem and Fumagalli to OEMs pursuant to contractsexecuted during the POI accounted for more than 60 percent of the valueof imports of the subject merchandise into the United States from Brazil.Further, we disagree with petitioner's contention that the Department failedto determine how many Borlem shipments occurred under contracts consummatedduring the POI. During verification at Borlem, we conducted traces on shipmentsmade during the POI and confirmed that those shipments investigated weremade against two contracts executed during the POI. A third contract concludedwithin the POI had had no shipments as yet. Remaining shipments were madepursuant to contracts with sale dates outside the POI.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department incorrectly determinedforeign market value for Borlem's home market sales because these saleswere made at prices below the cost of production. According to the petitioner,Borlem's own submissions provided to the Department gave the Departmentample reason to suspect that Borlem's home market sales were being madebelow cost. Petitioner, therefore, concludes that the Department shouldhave disregarded home market sales and instead based its determinationof foreign market value on constructed value or, alternatively, best availableinformation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Petitioner's below cost allegation is basedon home market pricing data which was subsequently revised by Borlem toreflect significant price increases. The cost comparison in petitioner'sanalysis is made against a net home market price exclusive of a sizableimputed interest expense; Borlem's actual financing expenses were considerablylower. For these reasons, the Department disagrees with petitioner's allegationthat the home market sales information provides grounds to suspect thatBorlem was selling below cost of production in the home market. Additionally,the allegation of sales at less than the cost of production was raisedfor the first time by petitioner in its April 3, 1989, prehearing brief,37 days before the due date of the final determination in this investigation.Based on the number of days petitioner had access to and could have questionedthe respondent's data, the Department determines this allegation to havebeen made too late in the investigation to conduct a cost of productionanalysis.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>Petitioner argues that Fumagalli's aftermarket salesin the United States must be compared with similar sales in the home marketfor purposes of the Department's final determination.<T3>Depertment's Position: </T3>We disagree. As we stated in our responseto Comment 4, shipments made by Borlem and Fumagalli to OEMs pursuant tocontracts during the POI accounted for more than 60 percent of the valueof imports of the subject merchandise into the United States from Brazil.Therefore,having examined 60 percent, we determined that it was not necessary toconsider aftermaket sales. See 19 CFR section 353.38(a).<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Petitioner argues that Fumagalli's warehouse interestexpense incurred in the United States must be recalculated for the Department'sfinal determination. Fumagalli's reported interest rate and inventory timeused for calculating warehouse interest expense differed from that foundby the Department at verification. Even though the Department stated inits verification report that the net effect of the discrepancies was negligible,the only way to determine the precise effect is to correct the calculation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have made these changes inour final determination.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Petitioner argues that the full amount of the terminalhandling and warehouse pallet charges reported in Fumagalli's questionnaireresponse should be deducted in determining U.S. price.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We exmined original documentationat verification and determined that Fumagalli received refunds for overpaymentsfor both the terminal handling and warehouse pallet charges. Adjustmentswere made for such refunds applicable to subject merchandise for the finaldetermination.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>Petitioner argues that Fumagalli's home market creditexpense must be derived from the sight (discounted cash) price, insteadof the gross invoiced price payable at a specified time in the future.This would more accurately reflect the true opportunity cost to the respondent.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. We confirmed at verificationthat Fumagalli's calculations for the home market credit adjustment werebased on the sight price.<T3>Respondents' Comments</T3><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Fumagalli argues that the Department made inappropriateadjustments when May, June, and July shipments to a U.S. OEM of a wheelmodel sold in April 1989 were compared with April sales of the comparativehome market model. Fumagalli states that the use of the April exchangerate creates distortions related to movement charges incurred in cruzadosfor shipments during May, June, and July. Further, Fumagalli states thatsince the monthly inflation rate in Brazil during the POI was 20 to 30percent, the nominal cruzado values of these movement charges incurredbetween April and July exceeded 100 percent. Fumagalli suggests that theDepartment could make fair price comparisons for these shipments occurringin months subsequent to the date of sale if it converted cruzado expensesat the exchange rate in effect when the expenses occurred.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We recognize that our methodology of convertingthe cruzado expenses incurred in May, June, and July at the April exchangerate introduces potential distortions relating to movement charges. Whenthe date of sale and the date of shipment occur in the same month, useof the date of sale exchange rate to convert movement expenses to dollarsmakes sense, notwithstanding Brazil's hyperinflation, since the convertedvalues are being used in comparing foreign market value to U.S. price atthe same point in time. When the date of sale occurs in a month precedingthe date of shipment, however, application of the earlier date of saleexchange rate may result in creation of dumping margins solely due to therapid depreciation of Brazil's currency during the lag between months.However, since no dumping margins were found under our original methodologyand since the proposed adjustment would only result in a lower margin,there is no reason to alter our methodology for these final results. Shouldbe discover clerical errors or other factors which would result in margins,we would then take into account appropriate currency conversion for movementcharges.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Fumagalli states that there were errors in the computerprogram. Values supplied in the original questionnaire response were usedrather than those later revised and verified by the Department. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department accepted and verified theresubmitted information. We also adjusted for the omission of the IPI indirecttax in the computer program which we explained to both petitioner and respondentsat disclosure. These adjustments were taken into consideration for thefinal determination. <T3>Comment 3: </T3>Borlem argues that there is no administrative justificationin using the monthly average exchange rates provided by the IMF. The Departmentclearly has the authrity to determine the proper exchange rates for itsfair value analysis where the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does notprovide appropriate exchange rates to the Department. Borlem also statesthat where the Federal Reserve Bank of New York fails to provide appropriateexchange rates, the Department should use its ``residual discretion'' todetermine, independent of another government agency, what exchange ratesshould be used to convert foreign currency in a less than fair value determination.The monthly exchange rate information provided by the IMF is based on dailyexchange rates determined by the Central Bank of Brazil and, therefore,the ultimate source of the Department's monthly exchange rate and the dailyexchange rates provided by Borlem is one and the same. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department typically calculates monthlyforeign market values in hyperinflationary cases to compensate for thedistortions that would arise from using a single, six-month average foreignmarket value. We recognize that exchange rate variations within a singlemonth may introduce similar distortions, but on a smaller scale. Normally, all currency conversions are made at the rates certified by theFederal Reserve Bank. During the POI, no certified rates were availablefor Brazil from the Federal Reserve Bank, but monthly rates were availablefrom the IMF. We have determined in this case that the exchange rate variationswithin one month using IMF rates are not so great as to warrant calculatingforeign market value on a daily basis from a third source. Further, theDepartment views the IMF as an official international organization whosedata reflect the financial exchange situation during the POI. Therefore,we used the monthly exchange rate provided by the IMF as the best informationavailable. <T3>Comment 4: </T3>Borlem argues that the Department should include allof the sales and foreign market value information provided regarding shipmentsmade after the POI that were based on sales during the POI. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We determined that the investigationcovered a minimum of 60 percent of the value of imports of the subjectmerchandise into the United States during the POI. See the ``Department'sPosition'' in the response to Petitioner's Comment 6. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results</ITAG>We determine that steel wheels from Brazil are neither being, nor are likelyto be, sold in the United States at less than fair value as provided insection 735 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination.
