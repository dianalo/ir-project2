 TheConsultative Committee on International Telephony andamp; Telegraphy (CCITT), theorganization that sets the standards for the communications industry, hasagreed to establish by this July the proposed standard H.261 (Px64) forcompressed video.andP;  The standard will enable equipment from differentmanufacturers to communicate with each other and allow easier connectivityamong equipment.andP;  Clearly, this will be a major factor in the continuedgrowth of this communications market.andM;Patrick Portway, president of Applied Business teleCommunications of SanRamon, Calif., a leading industry consulting firm, claims these standardswill probably have the same effect on the use of conferencing technology thatthe CCITT standards had no the use of fax equipment.andP;  Facsimile technologyhad been around for years, but the prime factor behind the increased use offax machines in offices was the establishment of international equipmentstandards.andM;Advances in long-distance video conferencing equipment, such as cameras,transmission hardware, and monitors, have put prices are on a steep downwardcurve -- yet another incentive for increased use of this tool.andP;  A vividexample of just how much technology costs have dropped for high-end videoconferencing comes from Portway's company.andP;  It assembled a two-wayinteractive video conference site for ARCO in 1980 costing $1.2 million.andO;They are now planning to put together a site with similar functions in 1990for Clorox for $135,000.andM;Transmission tariff prices are also spiraling downward due to thederegulation of the telephone companies in the United States and theresulting competition.andP;  Telephone companies worldwide, particularly Europeand Japan, are in the process of implementing Integrated Services DigitalNetworks (ISDN), which will continue to help bring the costs down and enablelong-distance multimedia communications technology to advance.andP;  With majorbreakthroughs coming in fiber optics and with increased intelligence beingbuilt into these networks, ISDN has been cited as promising &quot;superhighways ofcommunications&quot;.andM;Market OpportunitiesandM;Due to all these market forces: imminent international standard, fallingequipment costs due to advances in compression technology, droppingtransmission prices with the additional promise of worldwide digitalnetworks, the market for long-distance multimedia communicating bearing amixture of interactive voice, data, video and graphics will expand at a rapidrate.andP;  Most experts see this communications market developing into amulti-billion dollar market by the mid 1990's.andM;The accelerating information explosion and an increasingly interdependentglobal economy means that businesses' efforts to gain a strategic edge willrequire effective long-distance communication tools.andP;  Business offers thebest market potential for communication products.andP;  It is hungry to try outnew tools that may offer help in managing complexity.andP;  Target applicationsareas are corporate training, customer relations and presentations, andproject management.andP;  Fear of recession, particularly in the United States,has companies focusing on low-cost systems.andM;Growth in this communications technology presents new market opportunitiesfor electronic equipment manufacturers, software houses and systemsconsultants.andP;  Potential also exists for chip makers who are developing newdevices, DCT chips (Discrete Cosine Transform chips) that implementalgorithms used in compression, as well as specialized digital signalprocessors.andM;Software becomes key here as the personal computer begins to play a majorrole in conferencing either integrated into a high-end conferencing site oras a personal desktop long-distance communicating device.andP;  Electronic mailmultimedia enhancements are a growth component of this market.andP;  Technologysuch as the NeXT computer's voice e-mail capability could play a role.andM;Users' needs are becoming increasingly sophisticated.andP;  Demand is growing forreal-time windowing, high-resolution graphics and image processing.andO;Organizations want the ability to manipulate &quot;live&quot; spreadsheets anddocuments while conferencing.andP;  They are calling for modular systems that areeasier to install and use.andM;Robert Lucky, ATandamp;T's executive director of communications sciences, in hisbook &quot;Silicon Dreams, Information, Man and Machine&quot; says &quot;most studies haveshown that interactive speech is the most efficient way for humans toexchange information.&quot;andM;Experts also agree that humans use nonverbal means to transfer importantinformation to one another.andP;  Although we do not completely understand howthis all happens, multimedia conferencing techniques enable some of thiscrucial medium of exchange to take place in meetings among groups atdifferent locations.andM;Therefore, once an organization uses these communication tools, benefits areimmediately realized, which ensures the continued use of the technology.andP;  Asthe costs continue to go down and the technology becomes easier to use, morecompanies will be able to afford the technology.andM;Low-End ConferencingandM;Low-end &quot;desktop conferencing&quot; systems based on personal computers are underdevelopment.andP;  This market segment may offer the most growth for the rightproducts.andM;&quot;Timbuktu Remote&quot; from Farallon Computing allows two or more people atdifferent locations to share live documents in real time over a phone or ISDNline.andP;  Farallon calls this &quot;collaborative computing.&quot;andP;  Market response to theproduct has been favorable.andP;  Timbuktu runs on a Mac and gives geographicallydispersed people the ability to communicate and work together on designs,reports, spreadhseets and other applications.andP;  &quot;Timbuktu Remote&quot; can beintegrated into high-end conferencing or can be used as a stand-alonecommunications tool.andM;Remote screen-sharing coupled with voice conferencing, can be used as a toolin computer training and support.andP;  If someone is having problems with aparticular application, a technical person can offer &quot;live&quot; help by observingthe troubled person's screen from a terminal.andP;  The technician could takecontrol of the remote Mac and load new operating software or applications, orrun diagnostic programs.andP;  For security, a password system ensures no one canenter unless invited.andM;ATandamp;T's RapportandM;&quot;Rapport,&quot; in development project at ATandamp;T Bell Labs, adds yet anotherdimension of multimedia communications to computers by adding video andvoice.andP;  According to Sid Ahuja, head of the integrated computercommunications research lab, this project is focused on discovering ways tointegrate the communication tools usually available in someone's office --the telephone, fax and personal computer.andP;  Ahuja calls this &quot;desktopconferencing.&quot;andP;  Although a demo has been working for more than a year, hewould not confirm when Bell Labs might release the system in a product.andM;High-End ConferencingandM;High-end systems are sophisticated and designed in an integrated, modularfashion for ease of use.andP;  Most of the components of the classic businessmeeting are now incorporated into high-end conferencing.andM;The ingredient integral to high-end video conferencing is the codec thatcompresses video.andP;  Of the codec manufacturers, Compression Labs Inc (CLI) ofSan Jose, Calif.andP;  is considered the market leader with 60% of the worldwideinstallations.andP;  A major contender for this lucrative market is GPT VideoSystems of Stamford, Conn., which has a major foothold in the internationalarena.andM;CLI has a port where a personal computer, Apple or IBM, can be integratedinto the network.andP;  The company says that a Sun or a NeXT workstation couldalso be hooked in.andM;Timberly McGee, a manager with CLI, says she expects CLI's growth to at leastmatch the 54 percent annual growth rate in the mid-90s predicted forvideoconferencing by major market research firms.andP;  CLI is a major player inthe FTS-2000 contract, a Federal Teleconferencing System contract, whichcontains specs for building a $25 billion dollar ISDN network for thegovernment over the next 10 years.andP;  The creation of multimedia long-distanceconferencing is a key part of this contract.andM;CLI sees video conferencing emerging as a strategic resource for maintaininga competitive edge in the next decade.andP;  The company has developed a newproprietary video compression mode, the CTX algorithm, which provides qualityvideo pictures at low bandwidths.andP;  As a results, companies can usedirect-dial rates as low as $10 an hour.andM;A few innovative companies have been experimenting with video conferencingsince the 80's.andP;  Apple Computer opened its first private video conferenceroom in Cupertino in 1988 and two more sites in 1989.andP;  Its transmission ismainly via the U.S.andP;  Sprint Meeting Channel's fiber optic network and linksto the international public and private meeting rooms via satellite.andM;A tour of the $250,000 Cupertino conferencing site with Donna Collins,Apple's videoconference manager, was impressive.andP;  Collins created Xerox'swell-used conferencing network.andP;  This Apple site has two 35&quot; monitors to viewincoming video images, two 25&quot; monitors to view graphics and outgoing videoimages.andP;  It also includes an overhead camera to capture and transmit slides,a printer for producting a hard copy of video images, and a VCR for recordingthe meeting or viewing a videotape.andP;  The room is a comfortable conferencefacility with seating for 14 people.andM;A Mac II has been integrated and can be used to transmit data and graphics.andO;While Apple is not the first to open such a facility, they are being creditedfor probably being the first to integrate the use of a computer forpresenting graphics and data.andM;Collins says that with U.S.andP;  Sprint's video network, Apple can book meetingsworldwide.andP;  The company uses the system to conference with Japan, Europe, andmanufacturing facilities in Singapore, and Cork, Ireland.andP;  Apple also hasmade presentations to customers with the system.andM;Spring's Meeting Channel had access to only 15 rooms in 1984, but by 1989,its video network included 680 rooms worldwide.andP;  Network costs are continuingto decline.andP;  In 1984 US Sprint's high-speed network average hourly cost was$2,000.andP;  In 1989, it dipped to $285.andM;With continued advances in the technology for improved video compression andtransfer, Keith sees the trend going toward low speed transmission whichcosts only $60 an hour.andP;  Sprint's typical customer profile is a Fortune 1000company with a bent for high technology.andM;Educational UsersandM;The educational field is clearly an avid user of this technology and manypredict high growth for this segment.andP;  Live broadcasts via satellite allowelectronic field trips.andP;  Classroom Earth, a clearing-house forsatellite-delivered educational topics link-students in the USSR and theUnited States.andM;Michael Cole, professor of communications at the University of California,San Diego, was responsible for one of the first communications bridges to bebuilt between these two countries.andP;  High school students in San Diego andstudents in USSR were able to talk to each other about films they had bothjust seen via a Spacebridge link which was built between them.andM;Linking computers and video at multiple locations anywhere in the world for ameeting presents an incredibly powerful multimedia capability.andP;  Innovationwill determine just how creative and useful such systems will be.andM;To quote Robert Lucky again, &quot;The networking of humans is a deceptivelypowerful phenomenon.andP;  Networking plays a dominant role in many humanendeavors.&quot;andM;There is no doubt multimedia conferencing with its potential and appealcurrently represents one of the best ways for people to accomplishlong-distance networking.andP;  Development of the systems to accomplish it willtranslate into significant market opportunities and dollars for the playerswho are willing to invest in it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
