To determine whether exposure to occupational dust increased therisk of developing stomach cancer, occupational titles were rated forthe likelihood of exposure to various kinds of dust. Men who worked industy jobs had a risk for developing stomach cancer 1.3 times that ofunexposed men. The association of exposure to dust with stomach cancerwas stronger at higher levels of exposure. The risk was not uniform throughoutthe stomach: the highest risk (1.8 times that of unexposed men) was foundfor the antrum/pylorus. At that site, exposure to mineral dust carriedthe greatest risk for cancer (3.7 times the risk for unexposed men).The highest risks from dust exposure were observed in blacks. Risk wasrelated to race, socioeconomic status, and immigrant status, but thesefactors did not entirely explain the association with dust exposure.The observed relation between dust exposure and stomach cancer is consistentwith results of previous mortality and case-control studies of cancerin men who worked in dusty occupations. Ingested dust may be one factorin the etiology of adenocarcinoma of the stomach.</TEXT></DOC>
