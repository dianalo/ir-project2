<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0622 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention provides a secondary high temperature electrochemical powerstorage cell which has a molten sodium anode in contact with a beta-aluminacell separator. The sodium anode has magnesium dissolved therein to forma saturated solution for gettering impurities in the sodium. The inventionalso extends to an anode sub-assembly for the cell which comprises thesodium anode and the separator. The invention further provides a methodof combatting progressive internal resistance rise in the cell by dissolvingmagnesium in the sodium to form a saturated solution.</TEXT></DOC>
