The final rule amends the equity-risk investment regulation by extendingthe regulation for 180 days, until October 13, 1989. This regulation wasscheduled to sunset on April 16, 1989. The Board believes that the additional180 days will allow it to evaluate more carefully the empirical evidenceresulting from the Board's recent proposal to amend its regulatory capitalrequirements and the report on equity-risk investment sent to the Congresson February 10, 1989, pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Actof 1987 (``CEBA''), Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552, 661, andSection;1203(1987). Moreover, the Board anticipates that within the 180 day period,legislation will be passed directly affecting a number of areas coveredby the Board's equity-risk investment regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Richard M.

No. 88-1393 (Dec. 22, 1988), 54 FR 155 (Jan. 4,1989). The Board proposed to extend the current equity-risk investmentrule for 120 days.\2\<NOTE/> The regulation was scheduled to sunset on April 16, 1989.<T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.9-8(h) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Board thereby met the requirement in the CEBA thatthe Board provide notice to the congressional banking committees not lessthan 90 days before final action is given by the Board to any regulationthat repeals or modifies the Board's equity-risk investment regulation.CEBA, 1203(c)(1), 101 Stat. at 662. No comments were received from thosecommittees regarding the December 23, 1988, proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Board also proposed to remove the exclusion from thedefinition of ``equity security'' in 12 CFR 563.9-8(b)(2) for stock issuedby the Federal National Mortgage Association (``Fannie Mae'') and the FederalHome Loan Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie Mac''), purchased by insuredinstitutions on or after December 14, 1988, or some other appropriate date.By reproposal published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>the Board is deferring final consideration ofthe Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac issue. The Board received six comments in response to its proposal. Three of thecomments were from insured institutions, two were from trade associations,and one was from a U.S. government-sponsored corporation. Of the four commentsthat addressed the 120 day extension of the equity-risk investment regulation,all four supported the extension. For the reasons set forth below, the Board has determined to enlarge theextension of the equity-risk investment regulation, from the 120 days originallyproposed to 180 days. In its proposal, the Board stated that it believedthat an extension was necessary because additional time was needed to studythe empirical evidence accompanying related Board activity. Since the proposal,proposed legislation has been introduced that will have a direct impactupon the thrift industry and many of the operations of the Board. Any finallegislation is likely to have a significant effect on investments coveredby the current equity-risk investment regulation. The Board believes thatthe 180-day period is necessary in order to evaluate any such effects andallow for any necessary modifications to the regulation. While the legislativeprocess is continuing, the Board is continuing to reexamine the entireequity-risk investment regulation, and may propose revisions for noticeand comment, based upon the Board's experience with the current regulation.The equity-risk investment regulation has been an important component ofthe Board's regulatory oversight of the safe and sound operation of allinsured institutions. The Board believes that the regulation has serveda useful function in controlling risks. Therefore, the Board is, at thistime, deferring the sunset date of the current equity-risk investment rulefor 180 days, from April 16, 1989, until October 13, 1989. As discussed in the proposal, the Board has recently proposed substantialrevisions to its capital regulations (``capital proposal''). Board Res.No. 88-1342 (Dec. 15, 1988), 53 FR 51800 (Dec. 23, 1988). The capital proposalwould place all equity-risk investments in a 300 percent credit risk category(in comparison with a 100 percent risk category for commercial loans) forpurposes of determining how much capital an institution should maintainagainst this type of investment. It also discussed the possibility of establishingmore than one risk category for equity-risk investments presenting differentlevels of credit risk.The Board continues to believe that it is important to correlate its actionson the required capital and equity-risk regulations. The additional timeprovided by extending the equity-risk investment regulation will give theBoard the benefit of studying the empirical evidence received in responseto the capital proposal, as well as in-house studies performed in responseto that portion of the capital proposal.Second, in addition to work performed by Board staff in furtherance ofa final capital regulation, the Board recently completed a report discussingseveral aspects of equity-risk investments as mandated by section 1203of the CEBA. That report, submitted to the House Committee on Banking,Finance and Urban Affairs and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housingand Urban Affairs in February, 1989, contained, among other things: (1)analyses of the effect of direct investment activities on different sizedinsured institutions, state- and federally chartered insured institutions,and insured institutions in each of the Supervisory Examinations RatingClassifications; (2) findings concerning the degree to which losses tothe FSLIC were the result of direct investment activities; and (3) a comparisonof the effects of direct investment activities made both prior to and onor after April 16, 1987. Clearly, the information contained in this reportwill provide the Board and its staff additional data needed to make reasoneddecisions as to both the viability of many subsections of the current equity-riskregulation and the necessity of limiting or modifying the current regulation.Finally, as stated above, the Board now believes that an 180-day extensionof the equity-risk investment regulation is necessary because of the likelihoodof final legislation, passed within that period, that would materiallyaffect the regulation.In sum, the Board believes that a short extension of the current equity-riskinvestment rule sunset date, from April 16, 1989 to October 13, 1989, willprovide the Board the necessary time to study the empirical evidence availableas a result of the aforementioned activities and to make and review anynecessary proposals for changes in the equity-risk investment regulationwithout a lapse in the Board's oversight in this critical area.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and 12 CFR 508.14, the Board hereby finds thatgood cause exists for making this final rule effective April 16, 1989,rather than the usual thirty days following publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The regulation would otherwise expire on thatdate, causing a lapse that would be seriously detrimental to the effectivesupervision of insured institutions that make equity-risk investments.Because this rule is materially similar to the proposal, no delay is necessaryto allow institutions to become familiar with the rule's provisions ormake adjustments in their conduct. Therefore, good cause exists for dispensingwith the thirty-day delay of effective date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis.1. <T3>Reasons, objections and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated above in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONregarding the final rule.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply.</T3> The finalrule would apply to all insured institutions.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities.</T3> The Small BusinessAdministration defines a small financial institution as ``a commercialbank or savings and loan association, the assets of which, for the precedingfiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a).
