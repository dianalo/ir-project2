Congress ordered the ban in its spending bill for fiscal 1988. The provision was intended to punish the two companies for export-control violations committed by their subsidiaries. A number of lawmakers are dissatisfied with the provision, however, and are trying to come up with a different way to deal with the issue as part of the pending trade bill. If the law isn't changed, the ban would take effect March 21 and continue until the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. It could affect the sale of some $15 million in Toshiba consumer products to military exchanges and further delay the Navy's acquisition of an anti-ship missile produced by Kongsberg, Norway's state-owned arms maker.    The Pentagon said the ban wouldn't affect other manufacturers using Toshiba or Kongsberg parts if the parts represent less than 50% of the products' cost. This would free from the ban some U.S. computers using Toshiba semiconductors or microprocessors.    The Pentagon will accept comments on the proposal until Feb. 26. </TEXT></DOC>
