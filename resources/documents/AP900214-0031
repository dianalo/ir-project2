WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An environmental activist preparing to begin aWhite House policy job isn't getting the post because of what hesays are ``strong forces within the administration'' and Congress.   Dan W. Reicher, a senior attorney with the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, a liberal environmental group, said he was toldhis appointment was being canceled Tuesday, the same day TheWashington Post reported he was taking the job.   ``I was canned this morning ... a week and a half beforestarting,'' Reicher said. He said he had been told he would beginFeb. 26 as assistant deputy counsel for the Council onEnvironmental Quality.   Reicher has criticized Bush and Reagan administration efforts tocomply with federal environmental laws, particularly in the cleanupof problems at nuclear weapons production facilities.   He said pressure from ``strong forces within the administrationand on Capitol Hill'' prompted council Chairman Michael R. Delandto reverse his decision to hire him.   Deland, Bush's appointee as chairman of the council, said hedecided not to hire Reicher after realizing ``the degree to whichhe's perceived to be a persistent critic of the administration.''   ``It was my decision, my decision alone,'' Deland said. ``I haveapologized to Dan.''   White House spokesman Steve Hart denied there was any WhiteHouse pressure applied to Deland against the appointment.   ``It was Deland's decision,'' Hart said. ``It was a policydifference that he felt could not be rectified to a satisfactorypoint.''   Reports last week said there was a serious internal dispute inthe White House over environmental policy after White House chiefof staff John Sununu softened a Bush speech on global warming.   National Audubon Society vice president Brooks Yeager said theReicher move raises more questions about the administration'scommitment on the environment.   ``We're a little bit concerned that if someone with hisknowledge and his integrity can't sustain political scrutiny withinthe administration ... a lot of high sounding promises made to usby the administration don't mean a lot,'' he said.   The Council on Environmental Quality diminished in size andimportance under the Reagan administration, but environmentalistssaid they were promised by the Bush administration that it would beupgraded.</TEXT></DOC>
