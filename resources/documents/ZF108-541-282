So, for example, if you areat Bloomingdale's and you want to change your 800 number because in retailingthings move fairly fast, you can do this within minutes by applying somecommands to the network.andP;  .  .  .andM;It's those real-time events that we see in the '90s, that our customers aregoing to want to have, that have sort of heightened the need to put thesesoftware functions together.andP;  So we have one software-engineering factoryhere now.andP;  It takes care of the customer on both ends.andM;I also have the opportunity to do all the other sort of information systemsfunctions, as well, that occur in a corporation that grows at 30% and 35% ayear.andP;  So, I not only have the great complexities of putting out all thesystems that are needed I get to work with volumes that are challenging.andM;Q: When did you decide to joint together engineering and IS?andP;  And what arethe exact details of the union?andM;A: The first objective of the merger [which occurred in fall 1989] was reallyto take care of the connectivity, or the process that occurs between a switchevent [something occurring at one of the central office switches MCI uses toroute calls] and an information systems event.andP;  We sought to link customerinformation with the customer's usage on a real-time basis.andM;Previously, there had been loosely coupled interfaces because we lived in abatch-processing world, or some world where could wait 24, 36 and 48 hours.andO;That world has been erased, as I see it.andP;  So not only was it a necessity bornout of need by the customer, the technology allows us to do a lot of softwareinterfaces now where we couldn't before.andP;  So we can marry a switch platformwich an intelligent-node platform, which is DEC, and a mainframe, which isIBM 3090.andP;  So there are a lot of interfaces allowed.andP;  So it was a combinationof things of technology and the need to do it that moved us together.andM;Q: What purpose has the marriage of engineering and IS served?andM;A: The benefits are several.andP;  We don't have overlapping planning events.andO;This one group plans to make sure switch platforms, intelligent network nodesand large mainframes have the right interfaces and connectivity features thatallow cooperative processing across them.andM;More importantly, we [apply these platforms correctly.]  Previously,...andP;  wehad misused platforms.andP;  Now, we can do fast switching with switches, we cando great transaction processing with transaction processors; and we can dogreat database stuff with machines that are built for that.andM;In cost and function, we've aligned ourselves, I think, with a process thatmakes sense--sop planning and building start to harmonize a little better.andO;In terms of operations, actually running 7x24s [data centers that run sevendays a week, 24 hours a day], we have just put together in North Royalton,Ohio, which is right outside of Cleveland, one of the neatest combinations ofmajor switch facilities: two major Northern Telecom switches; a whole bunchof customer premise equipment; co-located stuff from the intelligent network;two 3090 footprints [systems] moving to four and possibly six in the majorswitch facility.andP;  That allows us to leverage the management at the site.andO;After all, DMS switches [Northern Telecom class-5 central office switches]are computers.andP;  They take the same heating, ventilating and air conditioningand the same 7x24 thinking that regular computers require.andP;  So we canleverage the management that's in there.andP;  So switch managers or data centermanagers, either one, could run these sites and cut down two-thirds of thestaff necessary to put in there.andM;Q: Can you measure whether this new organization is benefiting MCI?andP;  Whatmetrics do you use?andM;A: The metrics we have are descending cost and ascending capability.andP;  So thedescending cost is a percentage of our revenue every year.andP;  My particularpart of that goes down every year.... I must give more service with fewerresources relative to the gross growth of the company.andM;And that's the overall metric, but there are several others.andP;  One of which iswhen we put a new data center in we have only one-third of the people that weused to have.andP;  And that's a combination of leveraging your management in theswitch facility, as well as using robotic tape drives and centralizing someof the production and scheduling that we do.andM;Q: How big is the systems-engineering group?andM;A: We're closing in on 2,000.... That's a little more than existed a year agobut well within line of the metrics.andM;Q: As you define your business and objectives, you seem very externallyfocused on your customers.andP;  Is that unique to the chief information officerof a communications company, or should all CIOs--even those in manufacturingfirms--behave the same way?andM;A: A few people have awakened others about how important it is to get next tocustomers.andP;  A lot of my colleagues would love to do that, but maybe theculture of their corporation doesn't support it.andM;We have several customer focus points.andP;  In each of MCI's [eight] divisions,15 to 20 folks work for me but are matrixed to the division presidents.andP;  Andtheir major job is to work close to the customers.andP;  And close to thecustomers means to actually go out on sales calls and contract negotiations,because a large portion of that is customer information.andP;  so we are as closeto the customer as you can almost be on a day-to-day basis.andM;That gives us immediate feedback on what customers are asking for.andP;  We canfilter such feedback, add it up and decide that this [a service or capabilitydemanded by a customer] is a generic package that could very well go acrossthe board.andM;Location-lev el billing is a service that developed that way.andP;  People in ourSoutheast Division and the people here at corporate worked closely with threecustomers who desperately wanted this feature.andP;  And we soft tooledit--getting a robust prototype that could be moved into production up andrunning in three months.andP;  And we have now moved it in and have hard tooledit.andP;  So it's now an offering nationwide.andP;  This was a matter of five or sixmonths.andP;  So, not only did we have a short development cycle ...andP;  moreimportantly, it's just what the customer wanted.andP;  And that was because wewere close to the customer.andM;I, personally, have two accounts, a large car manufacturer and another largecorporation.andP;  It's my job to be the customer satisfaction manager for them.andM;Q: Do all senior executives at MCI manage accounts?andM;A: All have accounts.andP;  We're looking at it [customer account responsibilityin senior management's hands] as a long-range relationship.andP;  When I approacha customer, I don't have a quota problem.andP;  I'm just there to listen to whatthe customer has to say about our services.andP;  That keeps me close andabreast.... So that's not unique, it just happens to be part of the culturethat we have.andM;Q: Should your peers at other organizations take on account responsibility?andM;A: I can think of no better way for the information systems executive to getcloser to his company's business than to do just that.andP;  He could see not onlyhow the current products are playing but what the customers are saying aboutthe future.andP;  The IS executive also usually comes to the customer with asystems-engineering background, which is a problem solver perspective on mostthings.andP;  That's not only good for the IS executive but for the corporationbecause it needs that type of person in the field looking at what'shappening.andM;Q: How does matrix IS management work at MCI?andP;  Specifically, how muchauthority do division presidents have over IS purchases and management, andhow much does your central organization have?andM;A: The division presidents have a lot of autonomy.andP;  Their job is to act asrevenue producers.andP;  They have a local systems group, as well as our systemsgroup back here.andP;  So, if a division president is working on customerretention or whatever, he or she has the ability to apply local leverage, aswell as corporate leverage.andP;  .  .  .andM;The divisions are great testing grounds for technologies, as well as systems.andO;More importantly, their objectives are to penetrate and retain the market atthe lowest cost level.andP;  So, presidents have to worry about productivitywithin their own division.andP;  That's the area where we [corporate IS] wouldconsult with them and do things with them, acting as a liaison.andP;  So, ifthey're putting in a local area network and wondering where it will interfaceto a wide area network, we will give them standards.andP;  But we also have theteam out there to do the local area network, as well.andM;Q: Do the local IS groups within MCI report upward to your organization or todivision presidents?andM;A: They report to me.andP;  But their report card of performance really comes fromthe presidents.andP;  For the systems engineering people out in divisions, theirschedule, priorities and results are given by presidents.andP;  We combine withthem .andP;  .  .  where there's national focus.andM;Q: How much time do you spend in a given two-week period interacting with MCIdivision presidents?andM;A: Once a week, I give them a systems-engineering report, and they give metheir reports.andP;  There used to be a thing that [MCI chairman William] McGowanused to have called a Breakfast on evry Monday morning at headquarters inWashington.andP;  This was really neat when there were only 400 people in theorganization of a $400 million company.andP;  As MCI started to blossom out, itbecame more difficult to hold these meetings because people would be flyingaround the country.andM;Now, through the magic of something called MCI Mail, we have something nowcalled the Breakfast Report, which is put on every Frida.andP;  And the reasonit's put on Friday, the rumor has it, is this is how McGowans gets anothertwo days [the weekend] out of us because this is where all the controversyand all the issues are raised.andP;  Those come out sometime about four or fiveo'clock on Friday, just as we're all sort of packing up to leave.andP;  And so weget a chance over the weekend to digest, react and do something about it sothat, by the time Monday morning comes, I mean, pretty much we're under way.andM;Q: How much time are you spending with the division presidents?andM;A: I spend at least a day a week working with the presidents, or one of them,or combinations.andP;  Physically, I get to see them whether they're in town and,more importantly, when I go out .andP;  .  .  And I have a contemporary trackrecord when I walk in, so we always have something to chat about.andM;Q: How much time do you spend selling up to MCI chairman William Mcgowan orpresident Bert Roberts?andM;A: On a given week, I probably wouldn't see either Bill or Bert.andP;  On a givenmonth, I would.andP;  And I see them occasionally at lunch.andP;  So if you havesomething you want to do here, don't wait for the physical interface.andP;  Youjust talk to them on [electronic] mail.andP;  And mail is the major communicationvehicle that we have here.andP;  It's a cultural vehicle.andP;  You can sit hereprobably another two weeks and not see a mail cart come by here.andP;  If youreally want to insult someone, you send something by mail.andM;Q: If you were to be transplanted from this organization into another one,would you want to institute an electronic mail system?andM;A: Absolutely.andP;  I could think of no better way to cut the bureaucracy downthan to put one in.andP;  [But] culturally it has to be used.andP;  You and I couldwrite Bert a note right now.andP;  He would give me an answer within two or threehours.andP;  He's a busy guy, but he'd do that.andP;  My boss, I'd expect an answerfrom him almost in 20 minutes.andM;Most of our screens, as you can see, are up to Lotus Express, which doesreal-time polling.andP;  It's incredible that we can get to an issue in 10 minutesand start working on it.andP;  The sense for physical presence is diminishing.andP;  Ina manufacturing organization or any other that needs to communicate,electronic mail is important.andM;Q: How do your managers balance reacting to this constant feed of real-timeinformation with thinking and acting for the long term?andM;A: It's part of the culture.andP;  At a meeting, if I ask people to raise theirhands if they have more than 12 priorities, most can.andP;  It's a sense that you[as an MCI manager or employee] are going to have to work on more than onething at any focused time.andP;  But you should be able to catalog those thingsappropriately.andP;  Your ability to do that is what makes you good in thiscompany.andP;  So, I would say that that's the nature of it.andP;  You have to have theability to run with a lot of different No.andP;  1 priorities.andM;Q: Do you see any technology, such as artificial intelligence, enablingmanagers to better sort through all of the information available to them?andM;A: As this company gets bigger, .andP;  .  .  one of the things artificialintelligence allows you to [do is] leverage other people's intelligence.andP;  Andso if you use that as tools in your workplace--whether it adds the rule basefor finding out how tariffs are structured, or whatever; helps figure outdiscounting into a certain product; or determines how best to process anorder--they are all very valuable.andP;  Artificial intelligence is going to allowyou to have a different set of tools to work, so you're not working on themundane, but you're working on the important priorities.andP;  We're starting touse artificial intelligence very heavily in the front end of our presales andsales function.andM;Q: What are your top five priorities right now?andM;A: We have several products coming out: some more-advanced 800-number and900-number services and some things we want to do with our advanced network.andO;For instance, as we start to look at the customer's need for real-timeinformation, we think about not only giving reporting back to the networkmanagement group but maybe to the marketing or sales management group of acustomer company that tells it what type of responses the company is gettingto whatever--ads, etc.andM;This year, we're going to give the customers the capability of controllingtheir networks.andP;  And then MCI will gain the experience of seeing whatcustomers really need once they get this thing out there and can think ofsome more ingenious ways to use their networks.andP;  So we're looking to explorewith out customers.andM;We'll be back home here building the right processing infrastructure to takeus from a [central office] switch to 3090 platform in the sense that we'reputting a systems integration test lab together.andP;  As we start to think aboutnetwork software loads, they're going to have to be done on a real-time basisin a live network.andP;  Those loads have to have an A + quality when we do this.andO;So we're putting a software integration lab together that allows us tosimulate all those platforms--from switch all the way up to accountsreceivable and payable--on a transaction basis over the next year and a half.andO;.  .  .  The systems integration unit will be physically located in theReston, Va., laboratory.andM;Some people ask us: Where is our Randamp;D?andP;  Take a look at the Randamp;D budgets ofNorthern Telecom, NEC, DEC, Digital Switch and several other vendors whoseequipment we have in our Reston laboratory.andP;  That allows us to see what notonly state of the art is but how it could be applied to our network itself.andO;To the host of things now in ur switch and transmission lab, we're addingsystems integration.andM;Q: How often do you reshuffle your list of priorities in the span of a year?andM;A: Quarterly--considering those are the major review points.andP;  But within themonth of January, for example, 50 or 60 things changed.andP;  But the majorprocessing platforms that we've been working on pretty much have stayed thesame.andP;  So while we may make a lot of tactical changes [week to week, month tomonth], it's only quarterly that we take a look at what it is we're investingin and decide whether to continue.andM;Q: Are you altering IS budgets quarter to quarter?andM;A: Yes.andP;  .  .  .  But from a practical point of view, you're only talkingabout altering 20% of what you spend--given that 80% of the things you doaren't going to change.andM;Q: Are information technology suppliers spending as much time with you--MCI,their customer--as the company is spending with its customers?andP;  Are theyreacting to your needs as efficiently as you say MCI is responding to itscustomers?andM;A: In some cases, yes and, in some cases, no.andP;  They are trying to do similarthings, listening to their customers, but they also have a package ofproducts that have great generic value.andP;  So they are trying to sell uspackaged solutions, and we're always looking for tailored solutions.andP;  Sowe're not unlike our customers with our suppliers.andP;  Some of those peopleplease us better than others.andP;  And if they please us, then they become ourprime vendor for a while.andP;  But we all usually operate in a sense that we havemore than one product vendor, so we also have a very competitive set ofvendors.andM;Q: Are you finding more tailored solutions being offered to MCI frominformation technology companies--either your traditional suppliers or newones?andM;A: The good news is both.andP;  .  .  .  As we work further with our vendors, theyrealize how flexible we need them to be.andP;  A lot of that realization comesfrom when they haven't been [flexible.andP;  Then,] we have looked for alternatesources.andP;  The answer is we continue to put pressure on our vendors to help usput our products together.andM;Q: As you broaden out internationally, are you finding yourself having todeal with more and more foreign suppliers, or have you been drawing from abasketful of worldwide suppliers?andM;A: Our philosophy is to buy from the best in the world.andP;  If you visit ourlaboratory in Reston, Va., you will see Siemens, Ericsson, a whole host ofEuropean, Pacific Rim, North American vendors vying to work with us.andM;Q: Looking at the internal system used by MCI, are you making progress?andO;What, for example, is the company's position on open systems?andM;A: There are two aspects to an open system.andP;  One is, of course, it's good.andO;The other is it costs a lot to do that, in priorities and real cost.andP;  As westart to open up our systems to users, of course you get more fluent users,and they start to use more resources.andP;  So you're always in this sort ofaccordion balance: How much can you afford to give, and how do you make surethe right people are getting the tools to do it?andP;  That's why our folks whoare focused out in the field try to get some priorities, not only within thedivisions from a productivity point of view but to nationalize and leverageoff some of those priorities.andP;  .  .  .andM;If you work in a company like ours that Tom Peters described as 18,000crazies, it's not unfeasible to think that somebody could do a massive sortthat could bring a 3090 to its knees.andP;  So we're trying to find out where thecontrol points are to manage the need for data versus the abuse of data.andP;  Sothose are continuums that I don't see ever stopping.andP;  But there is aninsatiable appetite for data once it's formatted and presented.andM;One of the major purposes of the intelligent network management systems wasto let our customers have equal time to their data.andP;  And so that provides uswith the same challenges (it's a little harder to restrict customers fromtheir data) and new security opportunities for us to make sure customerscan't some how stage their data inappropriately and don't do any damage toanything else, as well.andM;Those are sort of our horizons--very ambitious.andP;  But we're always playingthis accordion between need and cost, and we think we're coming out close.andM;Q: Are there any developments in graphical user interfaces that you thinkwill improve the use of data?andM;A: There are some workstations that will allow us to do a couple of things.andO;One is to consolidate a number of our terminals.andP;  Those workstations couldacts as consolidators--linking disparate systems together.andP;  We also seeworkstations as specifically functional.andP;  A workstation could, for example,act as an AD/Cycle terminal--becoming a programming or systems workstation.andO;.  .  .  So we see generic-function and specific-function workstations beinga major tool for not only information systems people but our clients, aswell.andM;Q: Will MCI's workstations primarily be based on OS/2 or another operatingsystems?andM;A: In our case, it would be OS/2 first, UNIX second.andP;  But we see them beingboth, actually.andM;The larger challenge is controlling management of local area networks andwider area network as they start to blossom.andP;  .  .  .  Once a group of userscomes to some level on a local area network, there is a desire to move out toother plateaus of data--whether those are other local area networks or thoseare in corporate depositories.andP;  So we see the workstation as being a neat toobut also an expander of need, as well, crossing other areas of information.andM;So our job will get much more complex before it gets simpler.andM;Q: Do you see MCI becoming two companies, one that continues to providelong-distance service, the other a provider of information services?andM;A: .andP;  .  .  It's obvious to me that we're in the transaction business.andP;  .  . andO;.  If you take an information transaction and discern the difference betweenthat and the voice transaction or a data or a video transaction--which youcan't really--then it does make sense for us to be there.andM;It also makes sense for us to be in businesses we understand.andP;  So we mighthave some strong strategical alliances with people who are in the informationsystems provider business and we being in the transmission and deliverybusiness.andP;  So I think that's where I would see us focusing.andP;  .  .  .  Wethink there are some great natural alliances.andM;Q: Are you saying that it's unlikely MCI will forwardly integrate intoinformation services on its own; it's more likely to go the alliance route?andM;A: I'd say it would be more alliances.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
