(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hospital Corp. of America stock saggedTuesday in the wake of its approval of a $3.6 billion buyout offerfrom a management-led group, and analysts say they expect thecompany's new owners will probably sell off up to $750 million inassets if the deal goes through.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, HCA lost $3.62{ ashare to close at $43, apparently reflecting disappointment that ahigher bid did not emerge.   HCA's board agreed late Monday to sell the hospital managementgiant for $43 a share in cash and $8 in securities to TF InvestmentsInc., a company formed by HCA management and headed by HCA Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Frist Jr. HCA has 71.4 millionoutstanding common shares.   The deal will be sumbmitted to shareholders of the nation'slargest health care concern sometime in February, officials said.   HCA said the managers had enough financial backing to completethe deal, with eight lenders putting up $4 billion and investorscommitting $300 million for an ownership interest.   But one securities analyst said selling off some assets willprobably be necessary.   Ken Abramowitz of the firm Sanford C. Bernstein in New York saidhe expects management to sell up to $750 million of the company's$5.2 billion in assets.   ``It's just that in an LBO (leveraged buyout), you don't have theluxury of keeping non-earning assets,'' Abramowitz said. In aleveraged buyout, the buyers often borrow heavily against the assetsof the company, planning to repay the debt either through thecompany's earnings or selling assets.   Thomas McGinnis Jr. with Eberstadt Fleming in New York said it'salmost certain that the management will have to sell off assetsbecause the equity, or stock ownership, in the deal is relativelylow.   Joyce Albers, an analyst with First Boston in New York, said thecompany might sell its interest in Equicor, a health plans jointventure.   Albers said managers could also sell their interest inHealthTrust, an employee-owned company in which HCA owns preferredstock and bonds.   Victor L. Campbell, vice president of corporate relations, saidit was too early to discuss the possibility of selling divisions ofHCA.   ``There are no plans and really no discussion of that at thispoint,'' he said Tuesday. ``We just got an agreement last night andnow it has to go through a process of shareholder agreement which wehope to be complete by late February.''   Campbell said the management group expects to receive shareholderapproval.   ``This best serves the company and all its publics,'' he said.``The main reason that HCA had been a public company dating back to1969 was in the '60s, '70s and early '80s, there was the need forcapital because it was a growth industry, for building newhospitals, for expansion. Today it is a more mature industry, theneed for capital is no longer there.''   ``Clearly health care stocks and hospital stocks in general havebeen out of favor with the public for some time now,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
