An analysis of the commentsfollows:<ITAG tagnum="81">Schools and Teachers Program</ITAG>(Section 57.3) Who is eligible foran award?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received three letters concerning eligibilityfor awards under the Schools and Teachers Program.One commenter asked whether proprietary private schools are eligible forawards, or if eligibility is restricted to nonprofit private schools.Another commenter asked whether Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schoolswould be eligible for funding.A third commenter asked if the following entities are eligible to applyfor funding: American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas,Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, andthe Trust Territory of the Pacific.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Proprietary schools are eligible to apply for fundingunder this program. Neither the Act nor the regulations restricts eligibilityto nonprofit private schools.BIA schools operated by the Department of the Interior are not eligiblefor grants under this program. The Department of Education is generallyprohibited from making grants to other Federal agencies. However, BIA schoolsthat are not operated by Interior but receive a portion of their fundingfrom Interior are eligible for funding under this program.The statute and the regulations provide that eligible parties are Stateeducational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), institutionsof higher education (IHEs), nonprofit organizations, individual publicor private schools, consortia of individual schools, and consortia of theseschools and institutions. These types of agencies, organizations, and institutionslocated in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas,and the remaining Trust Territory of the Pacific, are eligible to applyfor funding under these programs provided they meet the appropriate definitionsin the regulations. However, under section 105(i)(2) of the Compact ofFree Association Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-239), the Federated States ofMicronesia and the Marshall Islands are eligible for assistance only underFederal education programs providing assistance to them as of January 1,1985. The FIRST Program was authorized on April 28, 1988. Therefore, agencies,organizations, and institutions of these entities are not eligible to applyfor funding under this program.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.(Section 757.4) What activities may the Secretary fund?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received many comments recommending variousactivities or projects for funding under the Schools and Teachers Program.In addition, two commenters asked that pupil services personnel or schoolsocial workers be included as eligible participants under activities (d)and (i) of andSection; 757.4.<T3>Discussion: </T3>the activities listed in andSection; 757.4 of the regulationsare based on the list of activities authorized by section 3211(a) of theAct. Given their comprehensive nature, these activities will support awide variety of projects, including most of the types of projects suggestedby the commenters.The Secretary agrees that pupil services personnel and school social workersare among the educational personnel that are eligible participants in theactivities listed in andSection; 757.4 (d) and (i).<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 757.4 (d) and (i), has been amended to include``other educational personnel'' as eligible participants.(Section 757.4) What activities may the Secretary fund? and (andSection;757.32) How does the Secretary limit the use of grant funds?<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the regulationsmight permit a private, church-related school to use grant funds for purposesprohibited by the First Amendment.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 3211(a) of the Act authorizes awards to individualprivate schools without restricting eligibility to nonsectarian privateschools and the regulations are consistent with the statutory eligibilityprovisions. Furthermore, Federal grant awards to religious institutionsfor secular purposes have been upheld as being facially constitutional.<T3>See Bowen v. Kendrick, </T3>108 S. Ct. 2562 (1988). As part of itsnormal review process, the Department will review all applications underthis program to ensure that they meet all applicable legal requirementsand that funds will be used only for allowable purposes.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.(Section 757.5) What priorities may the Secretary establish?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received several comments suggesting variouspriorities in addition to those already included in the regulations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The priorities in the regulations are those foundin section 3211(b) of the Act. Furthermore, the Secretary may establishadditional priorities for specific competitions in accordance with theEducation Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR75.105.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.(Section 757.7) What definitions apply?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received two letters concerning definitionsfor the FIRST: Schools and Teachers Program. One commenter suggested thatthe definition of ``at risk students'' include the ``children of adulthigh school parents and adult high school students.''Another commenter suggested that a definition of ``school-level'' be includedin the regulations to clarify the types of eligible projects.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The definition of ``at risk students'' for the purposesof the FIRST Program is included in section 3243 of the Act. While thedefinition of ``at risk students'' makes no specific reference to the ``childrenof adult high school parents and adult high school students,'' it doesinclude educationally disadvantaged students. Under the Schools and TeachersProgram, ``children of adult high school parents and adult high schoolstudents'' who are elementary or secondary students and considered to beeducationally disadvantaged would be included under the definition of ``atrisk.''School-level projects described in andSection; 757.2(a)(2) are based on therequirements for school-level projects in section 3212(a)(2) of the Act.The Secretary does not believe it is necessary to provide an additionaldefinition of school-level projects.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.(Section 757.10) What are the procedures for State educational agency (SEA)review?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received four letters on andSection; 757.10,requesting clarification of the procedures for SEA review of proposalssubmitted under the Schools and Teachers Program. One commenter suggestedthat this section be revised to indicate more clearly the means by whichSEAs may request the opportunity to review applications by requiring theSecretary to notify each SEA individually of its prerogative in this matter.Other commenters expressed concern that under andSection; 757.10 funds awardedunder the Schools and Teachers Program would be distributed through SEAs,rather than directly to the applicants.Another commenter inquired whether SEA approved of an application was necessaryin order to receive funding or if SEAs merely received a copy of the proposal.Another commenter expressed concern that SEAs would have the right to reviewapplications submitted by private schools and suggested that private schoolsbe exempt from this provision.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 3212(b) of the Act states that each applicationfor a grant under the Schools and Teachers Program shall be forwarded tothe appropriate SEA for review and comment, if the SEA requests the opportunityfor review. The Act does not provide for any exceptions to this requirement.Applicants must contact the appropriate State Single Point of Contact tofind out about, and to comply with, the State's process under ExecutiveOrder 12372. Applicants proposing to perform activities in more than oneState should contact the Single Point of Contact for each State and followthe procedure established in those States under the Executive Order. Thename and address of each State Single Point of Contact was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 18, 1987 (52 FR 44330-44340).In States that have not established a process or chosen a program for review,State, areawide, regional, and local entities may submit comments directlyto the Department.Funds awarded under the Schools and Teachers Program will be distributedby the Department directly to the applicants. Funding under the Schoolsand Teachers Program is not contingent upon SEA approval, nor will theSEA review process in any way delay the Department's consideration of anapplication.<T3>Changes: None.</T3>(Section 757.21) What selection criteria does the Secretary use?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received three comments concerning thecriteria for evaluating applications under the Schools and Teachers Program.One commenter questioned the number of points assigned to the plan of operationcriterion, arguing that assigning 20 points to this criterion has the effectof requiring applicants to discuss specific strategies and solutions intheir applications, and thus precluding planning activities from whichstrategies for education reform would emerge.The commenter also expressed concern that applicants for school-level projectsmay have difficulty in addressing the national significance criterion,especially the transferability of their project, and suggested that school-levelapplicants be asked to focus on the project's probability of improvingeducation at the individual school instead.Another commenter recommended that the number of points assigned to thenational significance criterion be reduced from 15 to 5 and that the educationalvalue criterion be increased from 25 to 35 points.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants toimprove educational opportunities for, and the performance of, elementaryand secondary schools and teachers. Specific information about how a projectwill be carried out is important to determining how well it addresses thepurposes of the Act and how likely it is to be effective, both importantdeterminations in making responsible decisions about the award of Federalfunds. Applicants that propose only planning activities will need to demonstratehow such activities are directed at improving teaching and learning, i.e.,the performance of teachers and students at the school level. Such activitiesare not precluded.Section 3231(e) of the Act requires the Department to consider the potentialtransferability to other settings in reviewing proposals for both school-leveland other Schools and Teachers projects. The Secretary does not believethat applicants for school-level projects should necessarily have difficultyaddressing this aspect of the selection criteria. One of the ways to promotetransferability of a project is to ensure that the specific conditionsof its implementation and outcomes are adequately documented. Supportingprojects that have the potential for replication means that more studentscould ultimately benefit from the expenditure of these funds. The national significance criterion incorporates three factors_proposedimpact, expected outcomes, and potential transferability to other settings_whichsection 3231(e) of the Act requires the Department to consider in reviewingapplications for funding. In light of their intended importance in fundingdecisions, the points assigned to the National Significance criterion donot seem excessive.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.(Sections 757.23 and 758.23) Under what circumstances does the Secretaryconsider an unsolicited application?<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that under the regulationsthe Secretary would have the authority to fund unsolicited proposals underandSection;andSection; 757.23 and 758.23 without first publishing any applicablepriorities or criteria in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The commenter suggested that andSection;andSection;757.23(b) and 758.23 be revised to state that ``. . . the Secretary mayfund an unsolicited application only after jointly developing prioritieswith the FIRST Board and publishing such priorities in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>The regulations provide that the Secretary may onlyaccept and consider unsolicited applications for funding in a fiscal yearin which absolute priorities have been established, and that only unsolicitedapplications that do not meet any of the absolute priorities establishedunder any competitions for FIRST for that fiscal year may be accepted andconsidered for funding. The advice of the FIRST Board will be consideredby the Secretary in establishing priorities for the Schools and TeachersProgram and the Family-School Partnership Program.Unsolicited applications are evaluated against the same criteria in andSection;andSection;757.21 and 758.21 used to evaluate other applications for funding underthe FIRST Program. In addition, like other applications, unsolicited applicationsmust meet the purposes of the authorizing statute in order to be consideredfor funding.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="81">Family-School Partnership Program</ITAG>(Section 758.2) Who is eligiblefor an award?<T3>Comments: </T3>A commenter recommended that school districts not eligiblefor funding under Chapter I of Title I of the Elementary and SecondaryEducation Act of 1965, as amended, be eligible to receive a grant underthe Family-School Partnership Program.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 3222 of the Act provides that only local educationalagencies eligible to receive a grant under Chapter 1 of Title I of theElementary and Secondary Act of 1965, as amended, may receive an awardunder the Family-School Partnership Program.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.(Section 758.4) What activities may the Secretary fund?<T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received two comments suggesting additionalactivities that should be included in andSection; 758.4.One commenter suggested that under activity (f), language be included toprovide for the evening care of children whose parents are involved incounseling services, but who are unable to make provisions for child care.Another commenter recommended that language be added to the regulationsspecifically providing for the involvement of pupil services personneland school social workers in Family-School Partnership projects.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The activities included in andSection; 758.4 of theregulations are those authorized by section 3223 of the Act. Given theircomprehensive nature, these activities will support a wide variety of projects,including most types of projects suggested by the commenters. With regard to allowing funds awarded under the Family-School PartnershipProgram to be used for child care, section 3223(b)(1) of the Act allowsfunding to be used for reasonable and necessary expenditures associatedwith the attendance of parents or guardians at training sessions for thefamily on the family's educational responsibilities. This would includeusing funds for the care of children of parents atttending such trainingsessions if the applicant demonstrates that providing such care is reasonableand necessary to the project. The regulations provide that ``other educational personnel'' may participatein many of the activities funded under the Family-School Partnership Program.Pupil services personnel and school social workers are among the otherschool officials involved in the educational process who would be considered``other educational personnel.'' <T3>Changes: </T3>None. (Section 758.5) What priorities may the Secretary establish?<T3>Comment: </T3>The Secretary received one letter regarding the prioritiesthat may be established for this program. The commenter expressed concernthat the flexibility and consistency of the Family-School Partnership Programwould be hindered if grant competitions were limited to specific instructionallevels, such as preschool, elementary or secondary. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary does not agree that allowing the Departmentto limit given grant competitions to specific instructional levels willhinder the flexibility and consistency of the Family-School PartnershipProgram. It could, in fact, produce the opposite result. For example, ifit is found that the majority of the proposals funded during a given fiscalyear involve the elementary and secondary levels, the subsequent year theSecretary could limit the competition to projects involving the preschoollevel, thus achieving a better overall balance. <T3>Change: </T3>None. (Section 758.21) What selection criteria does the Secretary use? <T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received two comments concerning the selectioncriteria for evaluating applications submitted under the Family-SchoolPartnership Program. One commenter recommended that under the need forthe project criterion, language be included to indicate that, in additionto reviewing applications to determine the magnitude of the need for improvingeducational achievement among students the proposed project is designedto benefit, the Secretary should review applications to determine the magnitudeof the needs of families for services and activities to increase theirinvolvement in their children's education. Another commenter suggested that the educational value criterion be revisedto require applicants to discuss the specific goals and objectives of theirprojects in improving the ties between schools, families, and local communitiesand how the improvement of these items will result in increased educationalachievement of students at the preschool, elementary and secondary levels.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The need for the project criterion asks for an assessmentof the need for the project. The need for services or activities to facilitatefamily involvement does speak to the need for the project. The criterionspecifically mentions the achievement needs of students to give advantageto projects designed to get the families of low-achieving students involvedin helping their children do better in school. The Secretary believes thisis consistent with statutory intent. According to section 3221(b) of the Act, the purpose of the Family-SchoolPartnership Program is to improve the educational achievement of childrenthrough increased family involvement. Section 3222 provides that only Chapter1 eligible school districts may participate in the program. The Secretaryviews the improvement of the educational achievement of students as theprimary goal of the Family-School Partnership Program. Given the emphasis of the program on improving the educational achievementof students, the Secretary agrees that the educational value criterionshould consider the extent to which the project addresses that goal. <T3>Changes: </T3>The educational value criterion has been revised to includeconsideration of the extent to which the project will improve the educationalachievement of students. (Section 758.22) What additional factors does the Secretary consider inmaking new awards? <T3>Comments: </T3>The Secretary received one comment suggesting that inorder to ensure the diversity of projects under the Family-School PartnershipProgram, at least one project be funded for each activity. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that creating such a restrictionmay unnecessarily limit his ability to fund the most promising proposalsto increase the involvement of parents and improve the educational achievementof students. <T3>Change: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-10593 Filed 5-1-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
