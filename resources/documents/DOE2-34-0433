In thecalculations, we use a pseudopotential for the electron-argon systembased on a norm-conserving ionic pseudopotential derived by Bacheletet al. [Phys. Rev. B 26, 4199 (1982)] and screened by an exchange-correlationmodel potential suitably chosen for electron-scattering studies. Theresults are found to be in excellent agreement with existing experimentaland theoretical data, proving the usefulness of this approach.</TEXT></DOC>
