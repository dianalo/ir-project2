Several raw materials are being investigated in an endeavorto achieve these goals. Carbon precursor materials and coatings of metalcarbide films are included in these studies. Accomplishments includethe following: The physical properties of LF POCO flour elements wereestablished. Chlorine contamination levels were found to be dependenton the zirconium carbide deposition temperatures; the LF POCO elements,coated with ZrC, were electrically tested up to a maximum of five hours(single cycle) and up to 4 hours 30 minutes (27 cycles, 10 minutes each);gaseous impregnation studies showed that the carbon deposited from thisprocess produced a structure different from the element matrix; the binderformulation studies showed that the addition of ACN to ITX in the manufactureof the binder must be controlled to prevent wide variations in the binderviscosity. 1 ref., 46 figs., 19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
