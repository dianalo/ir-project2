In an interview, Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of the specialty retailer, said profit was about $7.1 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $5.6 million, or 18 cents a share last year. Sales rose about 24%, to $107.8 million, up from $87 million last year. This year's quarter had two fewer days than last year's.    Mr. Johnson said more comfortable weather in August perked up purchases compared with June and July, increasing sales at stores open more than a year by 9% during the month, compared with a year earlier. For the quarter, same-store sales rose 6% over last year. The chain opened 29 new stores during the first two quarters and plans to open 43 more this fiscal year.    Pier 1, whose stock price hasn't kept pace with its rapid growth, has begun working toward a new, long-range goal of opening its 1,000th store by the late 1990s. The company has about 417 stores and expects to have 500 by 1990.    Mr. Johnson recently was promoted to chairman and chief executive from president and chief executive to concentrate on making sure Pier 1 can handle its rapid growth. Marvin J. Girouard, former senior vice president, marketing, was named president and chief operating officer, and will focus on continuing to upgrade the stores' merchandise to appeal to the maturing tastes of baby boomers.    The management changes followed a company search for potential acquirers this spring that failed to bring in a high-enough price to satisfy Pier 1's board and its majority holder, Intermark Inc. After deciding to remain independent, Mr. Johnson said the company set it sights on continuing its growth as a specialty retailer and increasing both the quality and the prices of its merchandise.    &quot;Our goal is to just simply let our quarterly results do our talking for us,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that our stock price will respond to our increased earnings.&quot; Its stock price currently trades at about 18 times earnings. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Pier 1 closed yesterday at $10 a share, up 12.5 cents.    The company doesn't plan any acquisitions or other efforts to diversify, Mr. Johnson said.    As one way to increase its average sale, Pier 1 introduced its own credit card in March and now has 75,000 cardholders. While its average purchase is $24, the average credit card purchase is $66, Mr. Johnson said.    Its strongest sellers this year have been women's cotton clothing, housewares and wicker furniture in decorator colors, he said.    For the six months, Mr. Johnson estimates that net income was $12.5 million, or 41 cents a share, a 26% increase over net income of $9.8 million, or 32 cents a share, last year. Sales for the six months grew 23% to $205 million from $166.7 million.    Gross margins for the first half of the year were 52.5%, up from 52.1% last year. Mr. Johnson said the company plans to spend $53 million this year on capital expenditures, financed internally and through short-term bank lines. </TEXT></DOC>
