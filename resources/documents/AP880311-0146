The source, a Tibetan-speaking traveler, said vans withloudspeakers were driving through the city every hour repeating thesame message.   Police with machine guns, meanwhile, remained posted in front ofthe city's holiest temple, the sprawling, white-washed JokhangTemple, and on the roofs of nearby buildings, Western touristssaid. It was at the Jokhang that last weekend's riots began.   ``They're warning people to do their duty, report troublemakers.They'll be rewarded if they give information,'' theTibetan-speaking traveler said in a telephone interview fromBeijing.   She said one announcement called ``for people to surrender _people who were involved in the disturbances _ before the 20th,otherwise they would be punished.''   Thousands of Tibetans demanding independence from China stonedpolice and set bonfires throughout Lhasa last Saturday in a day ofviolence triggered when one Buddhist monk stood up at a prayerfestival and began shouting anti-Chinese slogans.   Official reports said one Chinese police officer and one Tibetanwere killed. However, an American traveler in Lhasa who saw some ofthe violence said Tibetans estimate 21 Tibetans and three policewere killed.   The official Xinhua News Agency said a hero's funeral was heldFriday in Lhasa for the dead policeman, 21-year-old Yuan Shisheng,who was stabbed and thrown out of a second-story window. It saidmore than 2,500 mourners attended.   The Hong Kong branch of the China News Service, also an officialmainland agency, reported that a local Tibetan civil and religiousofficial and two 18-year-old Tibetans were arrested Wednesday. Thebrief report said they were accused of taking part in violentanti-Chinese protests in October.   At least 14 people were killed in the largest of those protests,when thousands of Tibetans stoned and burned a police station onOct. 1.   The China News Service report did not say why the three werearrested only now. It was the first official report of any arrestssince the March 5 uprising.   Unofficial reports of wide-scale arrests continued to filter outof Lhasa. Estimates ranged up to 1,000, but none of the figurescould be confirmed. Authorities have refused to allow foreignreporters to visit Lhasa this week and have halted sales of planetickets to Lhasa to all foreigners.   The approximately one dozen foreign travelers in Lhasa have beenvirtually the only source of information on events in the remotemile-high city surrounded by mountains.   An ethnic Tibetan from Nepal who left Lhasa on Friday saidpolice came to his uncle's house several times in recent days,making house-to-house checks for suspects.   The Western woman reported 10 arrests among the families of herTibetan acquaintances. She said the Tibetans reported policedragged suspects from their homes in the middle of the night,beating them.   She said she had stopped visiting Tibetan friends for fear ofdrawing police attention to them.   She said it was ``almost impossible'' to telephone outside ofLhasa, and interrupted the interview several times to say, ``Peoplehere (running the hotel) are getting very nervous'' about herconversation.   Trucks carrying armed police also drove through the city Friday,but in smaller convoys than earlier in the week, the foreignersreported.   On Wednesday and Thursday, one American said he counted morethan 100 trucks, each carrying 20 to 30 police, driving in a paradethrough the city in a show of force.   Even under normal circumstances, Tibet is a heavily militarizedregion because of its long border with India, with which China hasclashed several times. Large police and military installations rimthe capital city of about 150,000 people, and some Western expertsestimate there is one Chinese soldier for every 10 Tibetans.   China claims Tibet has been part of its empire since the 13thcentury. However, the remote region was effectively ruled for muchof that time by the Buddhist monasteries and the Dalai Lama, whomTibetans regard as a reincarnation of their protector god.   The current Dalai Lama, regarded as the 14th in a line ofreincarnations, fled to India in 1959, nine years after ChineseCommunist troops entered Tibet. His flight was triggered by amassive anti-Chinese uprising in which thousands of Tibetans werekilled.</TEXT></DOC>
