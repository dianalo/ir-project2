Analysts say this could be the first of many large-scale layoffs in an industry that has already let go more than 16,000 people since last October's stock market crash.    &quot;We're taking the attitude that this environment could last longer than some people think,&quot; Peter A. Cohen, Shearson's chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview yesterday.    Meanwhile, analysts said Shearson could reap windfall profits if the management of RJR Nabisco Inc. completes a $17.6 billion leveraged buy-out. RJR's management said last week it may propose to take the food and tobacco concern private for about $75 a share. Shearson, which is 60%-owned by American Express Co., would provide financial advice and financing for the bid, which is still being structured by Shearson and the management group.    Since the crash, the only business that has shown continued vitality has been mergers and acquisitions. In fact, there are so many mergers being proposed that some Wall Street firms are beginning to wonder whether they have the manpower to handle the business. &quot;We're approaching the saturation point for advisory personnel,&quot; said the head of investment banking at one major Wall Street firm.    But the sale of investment products to individuals has fallen sharply around the industry. Underwriting and trading also have lagged.    Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Inc., said the volume of total securities transactions is down about 22% from a year ago. Officials at several securities firms said privately that they are studying possible layoffs of their own.    Mr. Cohen said Shearson's layoffs are coming from all areas of the firm and that no department was being singled out. The layoffs began about two weeks ago and now total about 200, Mr. Cohen said. They will take place periodically over the next month, he said.    Shearson, which this year merged with E.F. Hutton Group Inc. to create the securities industry's second largest firm behind Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., has cut its staff by 6,500 since the merger.    Mr. Cohen also said that one reason for the current layoffs was that &quot;I was not happy with our third-quarter earnings,&quot; which indicated that spending had to be further reduced. Last week, Shearson reported an 85% earnings slide to $8.2 million, or two cents a share, from $53.9 million, or 54 cents a share.    Shearson's future earnings could be boosted by more than $100 million if the management of RJR successfully completes a leveraged buy-out, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
