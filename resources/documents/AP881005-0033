(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL announced Tuesday it had negotiated asale of its assets for $115 million to a Canadian businessman, amonth after PTL founder Jim Bakker failed in his efforts to returnto the helm of his television ministry.   Stephen R. Mernick, 34, of Toronto, will pay $50 million atclosing under terms of the deal and pay the balance over fiveyears, according to a statement handed out prior to a newsconference by a Mernick spokesman.   Mernick has interests in real estate, clothing, garbagecollection and landfills, the statement said.   PTL has been under the supervision of U.S. Bankruptcy CourtJudge Rufus Reynolds, who told PTL trustee M.L. ``Red'' Benton thata buyer must be found by Oct. 14 or he would order the assets soldto pay creditors. The ministry is estimated to owe more than $130million.   Mernick was not at Tuesday's news conference. An Orthodox Jew,he was in Toronto and didn't travel to Charlotte because Tuesdaywas the Jewish holiday of Simhat Torah.   ``His primary interest as a businessman is to get the maximumreturn on his investment,'' Charlotte attorney Joseph Kluttz saidat a news conference.   PTL's property, mostly in Fort Mill, S.C., includes a televisionstudio, a hotel and shopping center, a campground, amusement parkand a church. Private housing also has been developed on theproperty.   Bakker, who resigned as head of PTL last year after admitting toadultery, made a $172 million offer last month for the ministry butcouldn't raise the money.   ``Tammy and I remain committed to the restoration of theministry of PTL,'' Bakker said in a statement through his attorney.``If the present offer is agreeable to the creditors, the partnersand the court, and God's will is satisfied with the respect to theministry of PTL, we will be happy with that outcome.''   Kluttz said the contract was signed with Benton on Monday afterabout three weeks of negotiations.   Benton also did not attend the news conference. But Kluttzdistributed a statement from Benton saying he would recommendapproval of the bid to Reynolds later this week.   PTL's religious functions have been separated from its otheroperations, and Heritage USA Church is leasing back its facilitiesfrom PTL to continue on-site worship and Christian TV showproduction.   In a Sept. 15 letter to Benton, Mernick wrote: ``While I am nota Christian, I have a great deal of respect for the depth of thereligious feeling of the many thousands of Christians that havesupported the Heritage Ministry over the years.''   Mernick cautioned that he could not commit himself on theultimate disposition of the property, but left the door open tokeeping at least some of the property as a religious park.   PTL filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of thebankruptcy code in June 1987. Three months earlier, Bakker quit theministry after admitting he had a sexual encounter with churchsecretary Jessica Hahn. Charges of mismanagement and grosslyinflated salaries for the Bakkers and top aides resulted in an IRSinvestigation of PTL and a lawsuit by the ministry to recover $52million from the Bakkers and their chief assistant.   PTL's trustee also considered a bid for $113 million fromCanadian real estate executive Peter Thomas. Benton said last weekthat another group of investors from New York and Washington alsowere interested in the property.   A hearing on Oct. 17, at which the judge is expected to heararguments from creditors seeking liquidation of the assets, hasbeen set in Columbia.   At Heritage USA, the PTL complex in Fort Mill, staff memberssaid they knew little about the new owner or his plans but wererelieved a deal had been struck.   ``Most of the staff here right now, his name is just beingfiltered down. Until more information is disseminated through thenews media, I think the initial reaction from the staff is going tobe `Who?''' said Jerry Knode, retail director for Heritage USA.   ``But I think there's going to be a real sigh of relief thateverything has come to a conclusion. All of us have been throughthe wringer, and we're glad the ringer has stopped.''</TEXT></DOC>
