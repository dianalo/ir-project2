(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge gave the thumbs' up Fridayand NASA counted down toward a launch of the space shuttleDiscovery carrying the nuclear-powered Ulysses spacecraft.   Two demonstrators opposed to Discovery's radioactive cargo werearrested.   Discovery was scheduled to blast off at 7:35 a.m. Saturday. Sixhours after launch, the five-man crew is supposed to releaseUlysses from the cargo hold.   The satellite will then rocket itself out of Earth orbit for around-about voyage that eventually will take it around the sun tostudy its so-far unexplored polar regions.   NASA officials said Friday the countdown was going well. Fuelingof the shuttle, which includes a critical test of its liquidhydrogen plumbing, was scheduled to begin about 11:15 p.m. EDT.   Kennedy Space Center spokesman Dick Young said the mission wouldbe unaffected in the event of a shutdown of government agenciesbecause of the dispute over the federal budget. He said funds forthe mission had already been set aside and notices had gone outthat all employees were to report to work.   ``The mood of the team is confident and that's despitedistractions and disappointments recently,'' said launch directorRobert B. Sieck. ``If the weather is good to us, we'll have somegood news'' on Saturday.   For NASA, the news has been mostly bad since the last successfulshuttle launch in April. The agency has scrubbed four shuttlelaunch attempts because of hydrogen fuel leaks and learned thatthere is a serious flaw in the Hubble space telescope.   Another problem was added to the list Thursday when workersdiscovered that a 9-foot, 70-pound metal beam had been left in theengine compartment of the shuttle Atlantis.   When the craft was hoisted from a horizontal to a verticalposition, the beam clanked around inside the compartment, causingup to 25 dents and dings. None of the damage was believed serious,Sieck said, and Atlantis is still scheduled for a mission inNovember.   The beam is normally used to support a work platform used whenthe shuttle is being processed on the ground.   William Lenoir, boss of NASA's spaceflight program, said theproblems are isolated incidents and not signs of the agency'sdecline.   ``I don't see a common thread that connects the Hubble incident,the hydrogen leaks, and the beam,'' Lenoir said at a newsconference.   A group of 20 demonstrators gathered at a restricted entrance tothe space center Friday morning and protested Ulysses' nuclearpower supply. They milled around the gate, waving signs and callingto space center employees driving in to work.   Two women from the group were taken into custody after theywalked past a checkpoint into a restricted area. They were chargedwith trespassing.   In Washington, D.C., a judge rejected a petition by threeactivist groups that sought to block Discovery's launch with itsnuclear-powered payload. They asked for more research into therisks of the spread of radioactive materials should Discoveryexplode during launch.   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch rejected the contention, justas he did for a similar claim filed last year before the launch ofGalileo, which also was nuclear powered.   Ulysses is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator,or RTG, which generates electricity from the heat of 23.7 pounds ofhighly radioactive plutonium. The United States has used 22 RTGs onearlier space missions, including five moon flights.   NASA says the plutonium is housed in a module that has beentested to withstand any probable accident. The agency estimatedthat in the worst possible accident, there is only a 1-in-44million chance of 14.5 cancer fatalities over 50 years.   After Ulysses is released from Discovery, a two-stage rocketwill fire and send the European-built craft streaking towardJupiter. Ulysses will loop over Jupiter's north pole in 1992 andthe giant planet's intense gravity will give it a powerful burst ofspeed and hurl it back toward the sun's south pole.   In 1994, Ulysses will pass within 120 million miles of the sun'ssouth pole and about 18 months later it will pass over the solarnorth pole.   Discovery's commander is Richard N. Richards. The pilot will beRobert D. Cabana. Others in the crew are William M. Shepherd, BruceMelnick, and Thomas D. Akers.</TEXT></DOC>
