The apparatus operates by flushing the resinsa sulfuric acid solutions. The aim of the model is to optimize the purityof the regenerated resin and the productivity over time of the apparatus.Possible adverse reactions between the process solutions and adsorbentsas well as the flushed residue are considered.</TEXT></DOC>
