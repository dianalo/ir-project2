The incident was likely to increase Israeli demands that theUnited States halt its dialogue with the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian stabbed an Israelisoldier in Bethlehem, and soldiers broke up a funeral for a17-year-old Palestinian who died Sunday of wounds suffered in aclash the previous day.   The soldier was reported in fair condition and Israel radio saidhis attacker was captured after being shot three times with rubberbullets.   Radio reports said the soldier was stabbed with a kitchen knifeas troops ordered youths to erase anti-Israeli graffiti and takedown outlawed Palestinian flags.   The West Bank man who died was identified as Mohammed Shrain ofthe Aida refugee camp. Witnesses said soldiers blocked off the campand fired tear gas and rubber bullets to block his funeral. The armyconfirmed the death and said it placed a curfew on the camp.   At least 395 Palestinians and 17 Israelis been killed during the15-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank andGaza Strip.   In the occupied West Bank, the army sealed with concrete the homeof a Palestinian who stabbed an Israeli soldier Sunday in thebiblical city of Bethlehem, Arab and Israeli news reports said.   An army spokesman said the alleged assailant was caught andconfessed to the stabbing. The sealing or demolition of homes isroutine punishment for suspects in such attacks. Israel views thepunishment as a deterrent to future perpetrators.   At least 12 Palestinians were reported wounded Sunday in clasheswith soldiers throughout the occupied territories.   The army confirmed eight of the injuries.   The fighting in south Lebanon erupted when two armed guerrillaswere spotted on the edge of the Israeli security zone near Hasbaya,about five miles north of Israel's border.   No Israeli troops were injured, Israeli military officials said.   The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand, in a statement issued at Rashaya, Lebanon, said theguerrillas were among a group sent on a military operation intoIsrael. The others escaped, said a group spokesman, who insisted onanonymity.   The confrontation was the third between PLO guerrillas andIsraeli soldiers in less than three weeks. Israel cited the twoearlier encounters in calling on the United States to call off itsdialogue with the PLO.   Israel maintains the fighting in the security zone is evidencethat PLO chief Yasser Arafat is violating his pledge to give upterrorism. Arafat's pledge was behind the U.S. agreement in Decemberto open a dialogue with the PLO.   Israel established the six- by 10-mile wide zone in south Lebanonto protect its northern border when it pulled most of its forces outof the region in 1985, ending a three-year occupation.   Arafat, meanwhile, was quoted Sunday as saying he is willing togo to Jerusalem to convince Israel's leaders to agree to aninternational conference on Middle East peace. But he said he wouldonly do so with the agreement of other Arab states.   Arafat spoke in an interview with Italy's La Repubblicanewspaper. He has made similar statements in the past.   Also Sunday, the army said a colonel had been suspended from hispost for allegedly stealing a wristwatch off the body of a deadguerrilla.   The colonel was identified only as ``Col. R.,'' and the spokesmansaid he was an ``experienced and a veteran fighter.'' He wassuspended from his post pending clarification of the legalramifications of the incident, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
