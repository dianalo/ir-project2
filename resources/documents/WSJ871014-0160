SchiffmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> BEIJING  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Desperate to earn hard currency, China has introduced something out of the ordinary for tourists: a firing range where amateurs can be John Wayne for a day, even with big weapons.    Pistols and rifles are available, but there is much more. For 360 yuan ($97), you can use an anti-tank rocket launcher to fire a missile into a hill. For 560 yuan, you can zap a wooden hut.    China North International Shooting Academy, 25 miles northwest of Beijing, is a bizarre new tourist attraction. It proudly offers a wide range of machine guns along with Chinese copies of the Soviet AK-47 and the American M-16 semiautomatic rifles. Then there are larger products: a 12.7mm machine gun that rests on a tripod, and a 14.5mm antiaircraft gun that rides on a two-wheeled carrier. The ultimate is a 76mm salute gun that looks like a smokestack.    On a Saturday afternoon, U.S. businessman Chris Morton is visiting the range with family and friends. Mr. Morton is vice president and Beijing manager for Ecolaire Inc., an American maker of powerstation, coal-mining and pollution-control equipment. He is dressed for the occasion in a brown multipocketed jacket and a Flying Tigers cap.    In a red-carpeted room where small arms are on display, the Morton party assembles for a photograph in front of cases housing rifles and pistols. On the wall behind them are AK-47s, some with bayonets fixed. Mr. Morton holds a copy of Time magazine with Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the cover.    &quot;Get the ayatollah in the picture,&quot; he yells, causing a nervous Xu Zenghai, president of the academy, to ask what is going on. Mr. Xu relaxes when told the group just seems to be having a good time.    The Morton party decides against trying a rocket launcher and passes up the chance to use a gold-plated pistol. It settles on a submachine gun with a silencer and on the AK-47, which is favored by many of the world's guerrillas.    Moving to the shooting area, Judy Morton, Chris's wife, takes a seat and puts the AK-47 against her shoulder. She aims at a target on the range and squeezes the trigger. The rifle is set on automatic, and a volley of shots rings out. Mrs. Morton shrieks. She fires a few more rounds before letting a friend take over.    &quot;You really get a kick,&quot; she says. &quot;I've shot a gun before, but that was intense.&quot; Mistaking the comment as criticism, Mr. Xu explains that the weapons are top quality and thoroughly tested.    The range is a product of Deng Xiaoping's attempt to modernize China's armed forces in line with the country's economic reforms. To turn a profit, many defense plants have turned to production of civilian goods in recent years, churning out teddy bears and bicycles as well as bullets and guns.    The academy, a civilian project with military ties, aims primarily at earning hard cash from enthusiasts and tourists, officials say. But there is a side benefit: Arms buyers can sample the wares. &quot;I get the impression that the Chinese will do anything for foreign exchange,&quot; says a Western military attache.    Arms aren't sold at the academy, which some foreigners have nicknamed the Rambo Range after the popular American movie. Originally, the idea was to set it up near the Ming Tombs, a tourist attraction north of Beijing. But officials had second thoughts about guns blazing so close to the Ming emperors' serene burial sites. Besides, local authorities wanted to charge an exorbitant land-use fee for the plot originally selected. So the range was set up on the grounds of a work unit that designs and produces weapons.    Two other visitors to the range this Saturday afternoon are Jeff Arrillaga and Eric Weintz, 24-year-old graduates of Stanford University who met while traveling around Asia. &quot;We were in Pakistan shooting guns, and we thought if we're in Beijing we want to shoot these too,&quot; Mr. Weintz says.    An academy staff member brings them to a reception room, which doubles as a snack bar and trinket stand. Among the items for sale are stuffed dogs, toy revolvers and key chains with bullet ornaments. First comes a sales pitch -- an introductory videotape, recorded in English.    With soothing piano music in the background, a female voice announces: &quot;Friendship brings together all of us. . . . We hope that your experience here will give you a nice memory.&quot;    The video shows the range's weapons. At one point, a customer launches a rocket into a shed, which explodes in brilliant orange. &quot;Did you see that?&quot; asks an amazed Mr. Weintz. Later, the voice says: &quot;If you want to keep a record of this, our video service is glad to help you.&quot;    Mr. Arrillaga and Mr. Weintz select a sniper rifle with a telescopic sight and a light machine gun. At the range, the two men fire 10 rounds of each weapon. Both surprise themselves with their prowess on the sniper rifle.    The targets, which have vaguely human outlines, have concentric circles drawn on them. Hitting the innermost circle scores a 10. Next best is a nine and so on down to six. From 330 feet, Mr. Weintz scores four 10s, four nines and two eights. Mr. Arrillaga does even better, with six 10s and three nines. One shot goes off the target.    &quot;That one shouldn't be on the streets,&quot; Mr. Weintz says of the rifle. &quot;Any dodo can hit the center.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
