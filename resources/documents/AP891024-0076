(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Kentucky Lottery betting game onprofessional football was discarded before it began when Gov.Wallace Wilkinson declared it ``a bad idea'' in the face ofopposition from the horse racing industry.   The SuperSports game was scheduled to begin last week, but aflurry of court activity on a lawsuit filed by horse racing groupsdelayed its kickoff.   On Monday, the Kentucky Supreme Court lifted an injunction thatdelayed the game, which involves parimutuel betting on NationalFootball League games.   Several hours later, Wilkinson announced he wanted the gamediscarded.   ``The lottery, I think, is being harmed by the controversysurrounding the SuperSports game,'' Wilkinson told reporters. ``Thefun of the on-line (lottery) game has all been lost in the mediaattention given the SuperSports game.''   Kentucky voters approved a state lottery earlier this year in areferendum. Oregon was the first state to introduce a lottery gamebased on NFL betting, but no court action was filed there and thegame is under way.   Kentucky Lottery Corp. President Frank Keener and board chairmanWilliam Sullivan said in a joint statement they disagreed withWilkinson's decision, but would comply and discard the game.   The Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, Kentucky HarnessHorsemen's Association and the Horsemen's Benevolent and ProtectiveAssociation contended the NFL game would steal patrons fromKentucky racetracks, the only places where parimutuel betting islegal in the state.   The horse racing industry groups also said parimutuel betting onNFL games was not envisioned by voters who approved the statelottery, or by the Legislature, which approved legislation to setup the lottery.   ``Listening to people across this commonwealth, I think they aretelling me this is a bad idea,'' said Wilkinson, who previously hadtold lottery officials he would support the SuperSports game.</TEXT></DOC>
