During October 15-20, 1980, GeorgeBush spent time campaigning in places such as Nashville,Tenn., Dearborn, Mich., Westfield, N.J., Chester, Pa., andNew Haven, Conn. When in Washington, D.C., he had lunch withSupreme Court Justice Potter Stewart and Mrs. Stewart. Oneplace he did not visit was Paris, which is not surprisingconsidering that this was just weeks before the 1980presidential election.   Where George Bush was in October 1980 became a subject ofinterest because of the New York Times article by Gary Sick,Jimmy Carter's top aide on Iran. Mr. Sick cited unnamedsources as putting Mr. Bush at the center of allegednegotiations between the Reagan campaign and Iran to delaythe release of the hostages until after the election. &quot;Atleast five of the sources who say they were in Paris inconnection with these meetings insist that George Bush waspresent for at least one meeting,&quot; Mr. Sick wrote. &quot;Three ofthe sources say that they saw him there.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Sick said he is &quot;agnostic&quot; about thisastonishing-if-true charge that Mr. Bush took time off from apresidential campaign to fly to Paris, evaded notice by thepress covering the campaign and cut a deal with mullahs.Since his article and a related PBS television show, Mr.Sick's theories about Mr. Bush have attracted almost as muchpublicity as Kitty Kelley's about Nancy Reagan. Democraticmembers of Congress held a private meeting with Mr. Sick lastweek to discuss his claims. Congress can choose between theaccusations or government travel records that put Mr. Bushfar from Paris.   There are now rumblings that the House Judiciary Committeemight demand the appointment of an independent counsel, eventhough it's unclear what the alleged crime is or who mighthave committed it. Under the standard created in the Ethicsin Government Act, it's almost impossible for an attorneygeneral to turn down calls for an independent counsel evenwhen the allegations are murky or absurd. As always, thegreat temptation for Congress is to pass the buck to anindependent counsel; even partisan allegations gain instantcredibility, and if they fall flat the egg will be on someoneelse's face.   But if Congress wants to pursue any of the charges,there's no need to criminalize conspiracy theories by makingthis a federal case under some new Lawrence Walsh. Congresshas all the power it needs to investigate. The question iswhether there's anything worth investigating. Let's try totake the charges seriously.   For starters, what about Mr. Sick's three unnamedeyewitnesses who put Mr. Bush in Paris in October 1980? Thereare press reports from this period describing candidateBush's activities. If these aren't good evidence that he wasin the U.S., Congress can demand its own copy of his travelrecords. Given the byzantine allegations so far, maybe theexplanation will become that the eyewitnesses must have seena Bush look-alike in Paris. To be on the safe side, Congresscould also subpoena the passport of Dana Carvey, the&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comic and Bush impersonator.   The charges from unnamed sources and Middle Eastern armsmerchants involving William Casey, who was the 1980 campaignmanager, are complicated by the fact that he is dead. Hisformer secretary has told congressional investigators thatMr. Casey was not in Europe during the period Mr. Sick'sallegations put him there. In an interesting sidelight, thecongressional staffers who interrogated Mr. Casey's secretaryabout his travel schedule were with the General AccountingOffice, which supposedly is investigating whether the JusticeDepartment mishandled its computer contract with Inslaw Inc.,not whether there were secret deals with Iran.   Mr. Casey can't speak for himself, but Bob Woodward, thejournalist and author of &quot;Veil,&quot; confirmed on the Larry Kingshow on Monday that Mr. Casey did not give him any bedsideconfessions about any effort to delay the release of thehostages. This establishes a double presumption of innocencefor Mr. Casey. No doubt there were approaches of some kindfrom people claiming connections to Iran; even the JohnAnderson campaign reported being contacted. To rise to thelevel of scandal, however, there would have to be someevidence of a deal.   The likeliest reaction in 1980 to the hot potato of Iranand the hostages comes from one of the few allegationsinvolving people who are alive, non-anonymous and have beenhappy to talk about what they see as a trivial event. Someoneclaiming to have information about the hostages contactedRobert McFarlane, then a midlevel staffer under Sen. JohnTower. Mr. McFarlane contacted Richard Allen, a Reaganadviser, who asked Laurence Silberman, a former ambassadorwho is now a federal appeals court judge, to accompany him tothe meeting.   Participants say that the contact, who did not claim torepresent Iran but only to have connections there, said hecould arrange to deliver the hostages to the Reagan campaign.Judge Silberman recalls that he immediately told him, &quot;WeAmericans have only one president at a time&quot; and that if thecontact had any information he should give it to the Carteradministration. The Reagan advisers left; the meeting lastedless than five minutes. In an April 24 letter responding to aletter from Judge Silberman, Mr. Sick acknowledged that evenif this had been a credible contact, his offer was to releasethe hostages earlier, not only after the election.   The allegations against the Reagan campaign have a longhistory. Before Mr. Sick, the leading proponent was BarbaraHonegger, a parapsychologist who has written about the linksamong the Dog Star Sirius, the Freemasons and Mr. Reagan. Shehad a few moments of celebrity when she resigned in 1983 fromthe Reagan Justice Department alleging sexism. She laterwrote a book charging that Mr. Bush was involved in 1980 in asecret hostage deal with Iran, but her main source was a CIAagent who later turned out not to be a CIA agent. It's notclear that the new allegations carry any more weight.   Considering the enormity of the charges here, there reallyought to be some little bit of evidence before they areprinted in the New York Times -- let alone made the subjectof any kind of official investigation, criminal or otherwise.   ---                  Where was George Bush?
