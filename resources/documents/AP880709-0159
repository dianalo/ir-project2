Archaeologists said they believe the site was honeycombed withother shafts into which the debris of everyday life in colonialPhiladelphia was tossed, creating over the decades a layered timecapsule of the 18th century.   Athough the extent of the find still is unknown, archaeologistsare excited.   ``I haven't seen the artifacts. I just went down there andeyeballed the privy, and I was very much impressed with it. Thiscould be quite significant,'' said John Cotter, former chiefarchaeologist for the National Park Service's Eastern Region andcurator emeritus of American historical archaeology at theUniversity of Pennsylvania.   On Wednesday National Park Service employees alerted excavatorsto the presence of the privies _ brick-lined shafts built beneathouthouses.   Eight privies and potentially thousands of artifacts in themwere destroyed by the latest digging at the site, said RobertGiannini, assistant curator of cermics and glass for the park. Butthe top of one crumbling, dirt-filled brick shaft was saved whendigging was halted Thursday.   A 140-bed hotel and 442-car garage, to be operated by OmniInternational, is being built at the site by developer Kevin F.Donohue.   He agreed to stop the excavation after park service employeessaw the pottery shards and the privy shafts' brick linings beinglifted out by the construction crew.   Philadelphia Historical Commission members and the developerplan to meet to figure out how to remove the artifacts and allowconstruction to continue, said Richard Tyler, the commission'spreservation officer.   Cotter said some privy shafts of the 18th century were actuallydeep wells illegally used as privies. The area was residential inthe 18th century, but in the 19th century was developed into abanking area. Construction of a bank on the site probably causedthe razing of the outhouse structures and the destruction of thetop of the shafts, Cotter said.</TEXT></DOC>
