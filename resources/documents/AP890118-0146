In a report in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, Dr.Gilbert C. White II and others from the University of North Carolinadescribed the first use of the genetically engineered protein in twopeople.   One of them received 44 doses, while the other got 35. Theresearchers said the treatment appeared to work well.   ``We think it will be a blessing _ truly virus-free and trulysafe,'' said Alan Brownstein, executive director of the HemophiliaFoundation.   Hemophiliacs lack a protein, called factor VIII, that isessential for making blood clots. As a result, they frequentlysuffer internal bleeding and must receive infusions of clottingprotein derived from human blood.   During the early 1980s, these treatments were often tainted withthe AIDS virus. In 1984, after that was discovered, manufacturersbegan heating factor VIII to kill the virus. The strategy greatlyreduced the problem but was not foolproof. However, many expertsbelieve that adding detergents and other refinements to thepurification process has made natural factor VIII virtually free ofAIDS.   To produce clotting protein that is indisputedly free of AIDS andother viruses, the North Carolina researchers inserted the humangene that controls production of factor VIII into animal cells.These cells then made the protein.   The National Hemophilia Foundation estimates that about 60percent of the nation's 20,000 hemophiliacs are infected with thevirus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   It is not known how many of those people will eventually get thedisease. Currently, only about 900 hemophiliacs have been reportedto have AIDS _ slightly more than 1 percent of the nation's 83,000AIDS cases.   Among all AIDS virus carriers, about 20 percent and 30 percentcan be expected to contract the disease within five years, accordingto Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Their longer term prospects arenot yet known.</TEXT></DOC>
