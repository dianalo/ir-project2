 For more than five years, extremistgroups across the political specturm have used bulletin board systems (BBSs)to recruit and organize followers.andP;  But none of the boards have become asprevalent or as virulent as those run by skinheads--so named because of theirboot-camp hairstyles--who are self-defined proponents of a violent neo-Naziideology.andM;Skinheads emerged in the seventies as a breech birth of the punk rockmovement.andP;  Not all skinheads claim to be neo-Nazis, but their uniform(steel-toed Doc Martens boots and swastika tattoos) and their music (the hardrock that drives the movement) carry a singularly fascist message.andM;Today, skinhead rock remains the movement's most important propaganda tool.andO;But followers are discovering that the PC provides what the music can't:connectivity.andP;  Skinhead BBSs let users meet one another online, shareinformation, and plan events--social and otherwise.andP;  They help skinheads turnideology into action.andM;Several skinhead BBSs carry electronic bulletins or status reports,first-person commentaries about &quot;award-winning purges&quot; to help clean up thecountry:andM;Sonoma State University--Riots and kicking ass, touts one San Francisco--areaboard.andP;  During an anti-drug rally a bunch of long-hairs were doing crack.andO;When these guys saw us--all Skins--they started calling us &quot;G.I.andP;  Foe&quot; and&quot;Nazi Queers.&quot;andP;  We didn't take that shit.andP;  We jumped these guys, bustedseveral of the faggots' noses, kicked in the teeth of a couple of niggers,and smashed some others through a glass window...andM;The American Front, another skinhead BBS located in San Francisco, home ofthe Bay Area Skinheads (BASH), carries several accounts under a file called&quot;Hall of Fame Heroics&quot;:andM;--November 1988.andP;  The beating of Ethiopian immigrant Mulugeta Seraw, withbaseball bats, in Portland, Oregon.andP;  [Seraw died.andP;  Three skinheads werecharged with murder.]andM;--August 1987.andP;  Sacramento, California.andP;  The crucifixion of former WhiteStudent Union organizer Greg Withrow.andP;  &quot;Palms up, pierced with no.andP;  8 spikernails,&quot; reads the police report.andP;  [The White Student Union is awhite-supremacist group.andP;  Withrow, a former member who has openly denouncedthe white-supremacy movement, had his hands nailed to a plank and was slashedwith a razor.]andM;--Summer 1987.andP;  Chicago, Illinois.andP;  The beating of a &quot;turncoat&quot; skinhead byClark Martell, leader of Romantic Violence.andP;  [Romantic Violence is a skinheadfaction.andP;  Martell sprayed the woman with mace, beat her until she bled, andthen painted a swastika on her wall with her own blood.]andM;Besides the standard fare of racist rhetoric and violent fantasies, skinheadboards typically post phone numbers and addresses of &quot;enemies&quot; to harass,including Jewish business leaders and gay rights activists.andP;  Many boardsoffer practical advice for random thuggery, suggesting, for example, thatbeating a homeless person with a baseball bat is more effective than settinghis clothes on fire.andM;&quot;We have debates, shares opinions, and network about what's going on with thecause,&quot; says Mike Miller, the systems operator (SYCOP) of a popular neo-Naziboard located in Washington State.andP;  &quot;It's just like any other BBS.&quot;andM;Miller's board recently hosted an online discussion about American hostagesbeing held in the Middle East.andP;  Comments included a typical mix of racistviolence:andM;If we'd destroy the Jews, there wouldn't be any need for sand niggers to takehostages.andM;We should just wipe out the entire region with tactical nukes and show themwhat America can really do.andM;The same BBS regularly features online dialogue about strategies for oustingthe current U.S.andP;  government (called ZOG, for Zionist Occupation Government)through armed rebellion, along with discussion of which &quot;Jew-lovinglawmakers&quot; should be executed when the new order is installed.andM;Digital ConspiracyandM;Though skinhead BBSs spew more violence than other boards, their brand ofracism isn't unique.andP;  The Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party, the Order (aneo-Nazi organization), and dozens of splinter groups and sympathizers haveoperated or currently operate bulletin boards.andP;  Knowledge of the RadicalRight's use of microcomputer telecommunications first came to the forefront afew years ago, during the FBI's investigation of the Alan Berg murder.andM;Berg hosted a late-night talk show on Denver's KOA radio, and his frequentand acerbic on-the-air ridicule of racist organizations irked members of theOrder.andP;  He had received several death threats from the group.andP;  On the eveningof June 18, 1984, Berg was shot in the driveway of his Denver townhouse.andO;Soon after the assassination, the FBI moved in to arrest several knownmembers of the Order.andM;When investigators learned that Robert Miles, one of the eventual defendantsin the Berg murder case, was a &quot;computer wizard,&quot; the FBI tracked hiscommunications with other neo-Nazi groups.andP;  Later, by tapping Mile's modemline, they discovered an intricate network of Neo-Nazi BBSs.andM;The Berg assassination brought news of the technological advances of racistorganizations into the daily press, fueling often exaggerated accounts of the&quot;Klan's jump into high tech.&quot;andP;  It also inspired the computer networkingscenes in the 1988 United Artists film Betrayed (starring Debra Winger andTom Berenger), a fictional account of an FBI agent's infiltration of anunnamed white-supremacist organization whose members use PCs to plot apolitical assassination.andM;The W.A.R.andP;  BoardandM;Neo-Nazi boards began springing up in the United States as early as 1984,when a loose coalition of BBSs went online in California, North Carolina, andIllinois.andP;  One of the earliest, the W.A.R.andP;  Board (an acronym for White AryanResistance), began in the semi-rural town of Fallbrook, California, locatedhalfway between Los Angeles and San Diego.andM;Tom Metzger, a blue-collar entrepreneur who owns and operates a televisionrepair shop in Fallbrook, started the W.A.R.andP;  Board from his home in 1984using a Commodore 64 at a lumbering 300 bps.andP;  Its single phone line wasconstantly busy, indicating the high demand for online shite-supremacistmaterial and the number of neo-Nazis with the technology to access suchinformation.andM;Racist groups quickly hailed the W.A.R.andP;  Board as a technologicalbreakthrough, which helped spawn Metzger's reputation as the technologygodfather of the white-supremacy movement.andP;  Today, W.A.R.andP;  has more than2,000 members, many of whom are skinheads.andP;  He has become a figurehead,helping provide leadeship to the loosely strung movement.andM;Short and balding, Metzger is physically unimpressive, yet his prowess as amaster of white-supremacist rhetoric is legendary.andP;  He now hosts his ownpublic-access TV interview show, &quot;Race and Reason,&quot; a cable program currentlybroadcast in Atlanta, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and seven otherU.S.andP;  cities.andM;Metzger operates the latest incarnation of the W.A.R.andP;  Board on a multiuser286-based AT clone with a 40MB hard disk running FidoNet software.andP;  (Thedeveloper of FidoNet, Bay-area resident Tom Jennings, regrets the group's useof his software.andP;  &quot;I don't like them using FidoNet,&quot; Jennings recentlycomplained, &quot;but I suppose it's inevitable.&quot;)  The W.A.R.andP;  Board claims linkswith several other skinhead and neo-Nazi boards across the country and hawksbumper stickers (&quot;The Holocaust Is a Lie&quot;), Aryan jewelry, and videotapes ofMetzger's TV show.andP;  It maintains several layers of password security, makingwhole parts of the board accessible only to those who know Metzgerpersonally.andM;Murder OnlineandM;Most skinhead BBSs run on cheap IBM clones and are networked via customizedversions of FidoNet software.andP;  They use some kind of store-and-forwardelectronic mail system and surprisingly sophisticated software.andP;  Many offerusers a choice of transfer protocols, including Kermit, Zmodem, andsliding-window protocols such as W/Xmodem.andM;Typically, new users learn about the boards through word of mouth.andP;  To earnpasswords that give access to a board's higher security levels, users usuallyhave to speak with the SYSOP over the p hone.andP;  Access to a board's full rangeof files generally requires either a personal interview with the SYSOP or arecommendation from another high-level user.andM;Security has become a matter to increasing concern to skinhead SYSOPs sincethe rise of computer viruses.andP;  Many skinhead boards that once operatedpublicly have gone underground, using unlisted phone numbers orsystematically changing their numbers to keep out hostile interlopers whomight sabotage their systems.andP;  A researcher who monitors skinhead boards forthe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, a nonprofit organizationdedicated to opposing bigotry, suggests that membership on all racist BBSshas become much more exclusive in the past two years.andM;Skinhead SYSOPs have also become increasingly wary of law enforcementagencies.andP;  The Berg murder case made it clear that a BBS can implicate usersin criminal conspiracy.andM;In fact, police linked a skinhead board operating in Gaithersburg, Maryland,to the December 1988 deaths of four teenagers in nearby Bethesda.andP;  The youthsdied from the accidental explosion of a homemade bomb.andM;According to police reports, a 17-year-old SYSOP was arrested in connectionwith a separate March 26 pipe-bomb blast.andP;  The investigation led policeofficials to the youth's home, whee they found a BBS that contained severalfiles for &quot;growing your own homemade bombs,&quot; says a spokesman for theMontgomery county fire marshal's office.andP;  &quot;We also found an array ofbomb-making chemicals, 30 diskettes containing the formulas for making thebombs, and a printout with the names  of about 1,100 other users.&quot;andM;Among the materials seized, investigators found several references toskinheads in other states, though many of the names were aliases.andP;  Three ofthe teens named had died in the December explosion.andM;ConnectionandM;The Bethesda bomb blast alerted government officials and watchdog agencies tothe proliferation of BBSs and their power to organize disparate followers ofracist ideologies.andM;&quot;With the use of computers, the skinheads are closing ranks,&quot; says GregWithrow, the former White Student Union organizer and victim of theSacramento crucifixion incident, who now lectures before members of the ADL.andO;At the league's Los Angeles offices, he spoke in muted tones, scratching at aseries of bandages, reminders of the recent laser surgery that burned off theswastikas tattooed on his arms.andM;Withrow maintains that BBSs help translate vague political yearnings, intoaction by allowing users to collaborate, discuss tactics, and draw upagendas.andP;  he says that Metzger wants to organize skinheads from around thecountry, and he lays out a sketch of the skinhead network: Chicago AreaSkinheads (CASH) have ties to Detroit Area Skinheads (DASH) and theConfederate Hammer Skins of Dallas.andP;  The Dallas faction is networked withgroups in Wisconsin and Oklahoma City.andM;While ominous, these links often mean nothing more than a time prearrangedbetween SYSOP's to exchange binary files, so that DASH members, for example,can read and respond to messages and dialogues posted on a CASH board theprevious day.andM;As racist chat lines, skinhead boards may pose little menace.andP;  But BBSs alsoallow users to collaborate while concealing their real identities.andP;  And thisconcerns the agencies that keep an eye on the Radical Right.andP;  &quot;This is a Klanwithout robes,&quot; declares Leonard Zeskind, the research director for theCenter for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta, Georgia-based nonprofit outfitdedicated to opposing racist organizations.andP;  He notes that electronicnetworks represent a high-tech twist on the early white-sheet days of the KuKlux Klan.andM;Anonymous DialogueandM;Many believe that the technology of computer communications is &quot;a greatequalizer&quot; because it conceals race, creed, and color.andP;  Yet that veryanonymity attracts closet racists to skinhead BBSs.andP;  Zeskind believes this isparticularly true for young people who are enamored of skinhead rock-and-rolland curious about the movement's political leanings but don't yet want to beassociated with such groups.andM;Computer communications may be a more effective propaganda tool than printedmaterials.andP;  Unlike traditional extremist groups that rely on newsletters,skinheads are discovering that BBSs cross political organizations helpingthem reach nonskinhead neo-Nazis who might balk at openly associating withthem.andP;  And BBSs endow the skinheads' ideology with an aura of authenticitythat a clumsily typed newsletter cannot offer.andM;BBSs also prove to be more effective at disseminating their message than the&quot;Dial-a-Nazi&quot; type recordings found in most major cities.andP;  Such recordingsusually emante from simple answering machines set up to broadcast but notrecord incoming calls.andP;  these systems handle only one call at a time, and theinformation they supply can quickly become outdated.andM;A BBS lets whole groups of people share in a dialogue, a capability missingfrom newsletters and voice-recording systems.andP;  BBSs also offer the affinitythat comes from belonging to a community, as any user group does.andM;Guerrilla WarfareandM;The FBI won't comment on the volume of traffic on skinhead BBSs, insistingthat because operating the boards is not illegal, the bureau doesn't monitorthem.andP;  Watchdog-agency estimates of the number of skinhead boards inoperation vary widely.andP;  Many BBSs come and go according to the enthusiasm andfinancial resources of their SYSOPs.andM;Yet it's clear that the skinhead movement itself is growing rapidly.andP;  TheCenter for Democratic Renewal estimates that 3,500 skinheads in the UnitedStates identify themselves as racist today, compared with only 300 threeyears ago.andP;  And the movement is still in its embryonic state, according toMorris casuto of the ADL's San Diego offices.andM;The W.A.R.andP;  Board's Tom Metzger scoffs at complaints that the movement ssteeped in violence.andP;  &quot;It's so overrated, I can't believe anyone buys intoit,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;If the Jew-run newspapers would dig a little into the Baptistchurch, they'd find a higher percentage of crime among those church membersthan you would among skinheads.&quot;andM;Metzger places tremendous faith in technology to further his cause.andO;&quot;Electronic media is the only way to get to the white working class,&quot; hesuggested recently.andP;  Indeed, he envisions installing a generation oftechnologically hip neo-Nazis throughout the military and government until,as he explains, &quot;we can eventually seize power through the use of technologyand the power of information.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
