SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   White House officials insist they arecontinuing to look into prospects for renewing military aid to theNicaraguan Contras, despite warnings from Capitol Hill that theadministration doesn't have the votes needed to free $16.5 millionin stockpiled weapons for the rebels.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Wednesdaythat ``it's all under consideration, and we haven't made a formaldecision.''   A senior administration official, who spoke on condition he notbe identified, supported Fitzwater's comments, saying theadministration wanted to make clear ``we are not abandoning theContras.''   The official acknowledged that hopes were dim for getting thestockpiled weapons to the rebels this congressional term.   But he also indicated that Reagan aides were looking toward thepossibility of renewing military aid under the next administration,particularly if Vice President George Bush is elected.   If the White House were to seek release of the weapons, it wouldhave to move quickly. Lawmakers, eager to return home to campaignthis election year, are expected to wrap up work on Capitol Hillnext week.   ``There is some feeling now that a request couldn't be passed.... We've had congressional leaders tell us the votes aren'tthere,'' the official said.   But he added that the issue, for the administration, is ``aquestion of timing. Right now we're running out of time, and it maybe better to wait until the next administration.''   Fitzwater noted that a provision in a defense appropriationsbill Reagan signed last weekend permits the president to request acongressional vote on whether to release the $16.5 million weaponsstockpile, now stored in Honduras, to the rebels.   Congress rejected an administration military aid request lastFeb. 3, and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contrasoccurred on Feb. 29.   Delivery of the equipment was halted because of the CentralAmerican peace process and the cease-fire between the Contras andNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   The spokesman also pointed out that under the legislation,Reagan must meet certain criteria in order to request thecongressional vote.   Besides certifying that Nicaragua has sparked a crisis inCentral America, the administration must consult with the fourCentral American democracies.   Fitzwater said the president's justification for the release ofthe aid also must meet two out of three conditions cited in thelegislation.   Of the three, he said, the administration believes two had beenmet: continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and Sandinistaviolations of the peace accords.   The spokesman called the third condition _ that the Sandinistashave initiated an ``all-out attack'' against the Contras _ ``anopen question.''</TEXT></DOC>
