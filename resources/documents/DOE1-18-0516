<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0516 </DOCNO><TEXT>The unique confinement properties of the Reversed-Field Pinch (RFP) areexploited to examine physics and technical issues related to a compact,high-power-density fusion reactor. This resistive-coil, steady-state,toroidal device would use a dual-media power cycle driven by a fusionpower core (FPC, i.e., plasma chamber, first wall, blanket, shield, andcoils) with a power density and mass approaching values characteristicof pressurized-water fission reactors. A 1000-MWe(net) base case is selectedfrom a comprehensive trade-off study to examine technological issuesrelated to operating a high-power-density FPC. After describing the mainphysics and technology issues for this base-case reactor, directionsfor future study are suggested. (author). 25 refs, 5 figs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
