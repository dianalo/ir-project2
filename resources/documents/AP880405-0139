(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York's primary, with its prize of 255delegates and its reluctant governor, takes on even more importancein the next two weeks as the Democratic presidential race staggersout of the Midwest without a leader.   ``Tomorrow it's really going to get crazy,'' said John Marino, atop New York party official, on Tuesday.   At stake for the Democrats in New York is a national conventiondelegation second in size only to California's 336-member entourage.   And looming over the primary is Gov. Mario Cuomo, reluctant torun for president himself but equally reluctant to anoint any otherDemocrat.   Cuomo's coyness has fueled speculation for months about theprospect of a deadlocked convention and desperate Democrats turningto him with the nomination. As the primaries and caucuses unfoldedand the Democrats remained without a front-runner, Cuomo's refusalto endorse a candidate or rule out a convention draft prompted anew round of rumors.   There is also a Republican primary on April 19 in New York with102 delegates at stake, but it is considered little more than aformality as Vice President George Bush rolls toward the GOPnomination.   The outcome of the New York primary for Democrats, however,could provide answers to questions raised by the earlier primaries,including:   _Can Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis get his campaign rollingenough to again convince party leaders that he deserves thenomination? He campaigned in New York Tuesday even before theWisconsin polls closed.   _Can Jesse Jackson's solid support among minority voters and thebacking of several prominent New York labor leaders overcome Jewishuneasiness and produce a New York victory?   _Will Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s decision to put most ofhis remaining eggs in the New York basket prove to be anything morethan a nice post-Easter gift for some television stations and onewell-known political consultant?   Along with Cuomo, most of the state's other major Democrats,such as New York City Mayor Edward Koch and Sen. Daniel PatrickMoynihan, are remaining neutral. Koch has said he wants to go tothe national convention as leader of a draft-Cuomo movement.   While some Democrats have said they want Cuomo to get into therace now, his top political advisers insist that's not about tohappen.   ``He is as staunch as he's ever been,'' said Cuomo politicaladviser Meyer Frucher of the governor's reaction to suchentreaties. ``The more you argue with him, the more adamant hegets.''   The New York primary ballot will include a pro-Cuomo uncommitteddelegate slate arranged by a group of elected upstate Democraticcounty clerks who want to see the governor in the race. Cuomo hasdisavowed any connection with the effort.   For his part, Cuomo has said he and other party leaders shouldround up enough extra votes after the last primaries to guaranteethe nomination to the front-runner at that point, whoever it is.   At the moment, Marino said the edge in New York has to go toJackson because of his strong support among blacks and Hispanics.   ``I don't care what any poll says ... Jackson has the strongestbase,'' said the Cuomo political operative.   Recent polls among New York Democrats have Dukakis leading thefield with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent, dependingon the poll. Jackson has been consistently second at just under 30percent while Gore and Simon have yet to crack double digits in anyof the polls.   While Marino says New York is important to all the candidates,the state party's executive director said ``Al Gore has to win thisstate outright'' to remain viable.   Gore has hired New York political consultant David Garth, whoruns Koch's campaigns and who occasionally advises Cuomo. Gore willspend more than $1 million in New York, much of it for televisionadvertising.   Gore, striving to make an impact with New York's politicallyimportant Jewish community, has been attacking Jackson and Dukakison the issue of support for Israel. If Gore's message has an impactit could hurt Dukakis most; Jackson's support among New York Jewsis minimal following his ``Hymietown'' gaffe in 1984.   Jackson is relying on his strong minority support, coupled witha growing acceptance among white voters, to win more than the 26percent he garnered in 1984.   Jackson plans a big television purchase in New York, a tool hehasn't used much in other states. He also has the support ofinfluential labor leaders such as Stanley Hill, executive directorof the 120,000-member New York City municipal workers union, andJan Pierce, a top official with the Communications Workers ofAmerica.   According to Marino, Jackson and Dukakis have the bestorganizations. Dukakis also has the most money to spend, possiblyas much as $3 million, for the New York effort.</TEXT></DOC>
