Executives atthe steelmaker's Pittsburgh headquarters still get letters.But another firm, Ameriscribe Corp., sorts and distributesthem. The New York company also handles all of National'smajor copying work.   Ameriscribe does the jobs &quot;more professionally,efficiently and cost effectively,&quot; says Milan Vuchenich,National's manager of employment and development. Heestimates that National is saving $2,000 a month, notcounting employee-benefit costs. &quot;It also relieves us of someadministrative headaches,&quot; he says.</LP><TEXT>   Most important, Mr. Vuchenich adds, Ameriscribe is helpingthe steelmaker focus on its core business. &quot;Our business isproducing steel,&quot; he says, &quot;and whenever we can devote moreresources to it, that's what we want to do.&quot;   With its annual sales tripling since 1986 to $88 millionlast year, Ameriscribe is one of many companies growing fastby taking over tasks that large corporations used to performthemselves. Big companies are under growing pressure toimprove efficiency, cut costs and concentrate on the corebusiness activities that matter most. As a result, they arehanding over to specialists like Ameriscribe all kinds ofwork, including office chores, engineering, shipping,manufacturing and maintenance.   In a survey of 1,005 of the nation's largest corporationsin January and February, consultant Wyatt Co. found that 86%had cut back operations over the previous five years and that35% were making greater use of outsiders.   &quot;It's not a fad,&quot; says Samuel Ehrenhalt, the regionalcommissioner for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in NewYork. &quot;It's a trend that reflects a reassessment of acompany's function.&quot; As a result, he says, scores of smallercompanies have emerged to supply big business withspecialized services. As a group, &quot;They have become a majorgrowth industry on the American scene.&quot;   SunGard Data Systems Inc., whose annual revenue hasdoubled since 1987 to $262 million last year, has prosperedfrom picking up some of the accounting chores at bigfinancial institutions. At a subsidiary of Security PacificCorp., for instance, the Wayne, Pa., company keeps records ofbondholders for whom the banking concern serves as a trustee.It also evaluates the performance of the subsidiary'sinvestment portfolio -- an in-house job until three yearsago.   For J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., BankAmerica Corp. and SunGard'sother customers, the decision to turn over such functions &quot;isan economic one,&quot; says Joseph Laudone, managing director ofthe Security Pacific subsidiary, Sequor Group. &quot;SunGard isable to deliver the service for less than we wouldinternally.&quot;   Oil companies that turn to Serv-Tech Inc. to maintaintheir refineries seek similar savings. The Houston concern'scustomers, which include nine of the nation's 10 largestpetroleum refiners, used to employ maintenance crews tooverhaul their plants every two or three years. But after theoil bust in the early 1980s, Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. andothers started farming out the job.   &quot;It doesn't make any sense for these companies to keep abig maintenance capability when they do this work only on aperiodic basis,&quot; says John Slack, Serv-Tech's chief financialofficer. Because Serv-Tech specializes in refinerymaintenance, it also gets the job done faster, minimizing theduration of the plant's shutdown.   Serv-Tech's sales have climbed eightfold since 1986, to$42 million last year. To keep growing, the company in 1990added to its list of maintenance services a specialty weldingunit that now accounts for nearly 10% of revenue. It is alsoexpanding in Europe, where Royal Dutch/Shell Group andBritish Petroleum Co. recently hired it to maintainrefineries.   Much of the success of Comptronix Corp. in Guntersville,Ala., stems from the fact that it enables clients toconcentrate on their most crucial business functions. Thecompany, whose annual sales have soared tenfold since 1986 to$70 million last year, makes electronic components forproducers of computers, medical devices and communicationsequipment. Its biggest customer, for example, is NorthernTelecom Ltd.   Some of these companies, says William Hebding,Comptronix's chairman and chief executive, &quot;have completelyshut down their internal manufacturing to allocate theirresources to where they can get the most bang for their buck:product development and marketing.&quot;   Analysts estimate so-called contract manufacturing -- inthe U.S. electronics market, a $4 billion-a-year industrydominated by small concerns -- is expanding at an annual rateof 12%. Most of that growth is coming from new business, Mr.Hebding says. But much of it is also related to theincreasing demands of existing clients. Companies that usedto rely on Comptronix mainly to supply labor and build partsare now asking the company &quot;not only to build whole products,but also buy the materials,&quot; Mr. Hebding says.   The specialists that ship products after they're built arealso doing more of the things that their customers once didthemselves. For years, Harper Group Inc., a San Franciscofreight forwarder, mainly transported goods from one locationto another. But as manufacturers increasingly viewed shippingand tasks related to it as ancillary functions, Harper tookon new responsibilities.   The company, whose annual sales have more than doubledsince 1986 to $436 million last year, now packagessemiconductors for Texas Instruments Inc. in addition tomanaging their shipment. For a joint venture between ClarkEquipment Co. and Samsung Group, Harper comes close to actingas a supplier. It arranges the purchase of forklift partsfrom several European sources, consolidates the orders in theNetherlands and sends them off to the venture's factory inSouth Korea.   As companies continue to focus on the core of theirbusiness, such work &quot;is going to be part of what's expectedof a freight forwarder,&quot; says William Goldsborough, Harper'smanaging director of logistics services. &quot;Increasingly, thatis what the client is going to require.&quot;   Ultimately, developing the ability to take on such taskswill become more than an opportunity to increase sales, Mr.Goldborough adds. &quot;We see it as being essential to survival.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
