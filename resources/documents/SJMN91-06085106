This comparesto about a 26 percent average cutback required last year.;    Since thedistrict allots an equal amount of water per hookup, regardless of the numberof people in the household, some with big families like Merrill are concernedmost about the availability of water indoors.;    Starting in June, his familyof nine will try to get by on the same amount of water allocated to a homewith a single occupant.;    &quot;In the summer, with that many people, I don'tthink it's workable. If there's no adjustment . . . I'm sure we will exceedthe allotment and they'll put a restricter on,&quot; he said. &quot;And then it will bea war zone. Then we will run out of water.&quot;;    He is appealing his case tothe water district.;    Foothill College, often hailed as the best landscapedof any of its Bay Area counterparts, will suffer severe cuts. Mal Leal,district director of operations, said the campus will be forced to cut back anaverage of 68 percent in water use for the rest of 1991. The most severe cutwould be 82 percent in July.;    Under the water district's new rules, waterflow restricters will be placed on meters of households that use 14,960gallons a month, or about 483 gallons a day. But, for fire safety reasons, ifFoothill exceeds its own allotment, it will not be subject to restricters,said Bill McCann,  general manager of the water district. However, penaltiesfor excess water use would be levied at almost 10 times the normal rate, hesaid.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DON BRIGNOLO, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910325  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  429  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 25, 199100085106,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
