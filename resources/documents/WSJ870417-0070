But other U.S. officials indicated it's unlikely that the Fed will have to boost interest rates much to prop up the dollar. They said they expect Japan and possibly West Germany to lower their interest rates soon. Such a move would help stabilize the U.S. currency against the yen and the mark.    Budget Director James Miller said at a breakfast with reporters that he was &quot;concerned about the Fed's overreacting&quot; to the dollar's drop. Noting that money-supply measures have fallen in recent weeks, Mr. Miller said he was &quot;worried&quot; about the possibility that an overreaction by the Fed could cause a recession a year from now.    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, has been expressing similar fears in private meetings with other White House officials, according to administration sources.    Mr. Miller's comments come the day after Secretary Baker, the administration's point man on economic policy, stepped up his rhetoric to stop a further decline in the dollar. During a speech to the Japan Society Wednesday night, Mr. Baker said: &quot;Let me make one point clear: A further decline of the dollar against other main non-dollar currencies could very well be counterproductive to our goal of higher growth&quot; in West Germany and Japan. Although similar to sentiments he has expressed in the past, the comment was both intended by Mr. Baker and interpreted in financial markets as a more forceful statement than before, and helped buoy the dollar in foreign-exchange markets.    The developments came as the U.S. prepared to formally impose tariffs today on many Japanese electronic products, a move that has heightened trade tensions between the two nations and helped to depress the dollar against the yen in recent weeks.    Although U.S. officials seem more determined than ever to see currency markets stabilize, it's clear that they are anxious to avoid achieving that goal with a substantial rise in U.S. interest rates. Rather, they hope and expect that Japan will lower its rates and that West Germany may follow suit. That would make the dollar more attractive to investors relative to the yen and the mark, because dollar-denominated investments would yield more than those denominated in other currencies.    Mr. Miller's concerns about a tighter Fed policy were echoed by Martha Seger, a member of the Reserve Board, who said in an interview yesterday that she believes the economy is still sluggish. &quot;If in the process of protecting our dollar we tip a slow economy into a recession, that doesn't help anybody,&quot; Ms. Seger said    The U.S. has been arguing for months that the best way tobolster the dollar and resolve global trade imbalances is forBonn and Tokyo to adopt stimulative policies and import moregoods. One U.S. official said that the Japanese are likely toease credit soon with an aim to driving the dollar up -- andthe yen down -- from current levels. That would ease the paina bit on Japanese exporters, who have been badly hurt by thestrong yen.   It isn't clear, however, whether the Bank of Japan would ease credit by cutting its discount rate, a key central bank lending fee, or by other moves to lower money-market rates in Japan. </TEXT></DOC>
