In apreferred embodiment a first source develops a high-power intense relativisticelectron beam (IREB). A modulating apparatus modulates the IREB witha low-power-level radiofrequency (RF) signal to produce a high powerMIREB. All of the kinetic energy from the high-power MIREB is then storedas a high level of electromagnetic or RF energy in an accelerating apparatus.A particle beam from a source is modulated with the RF signal to establisha phase coherency between the modulated particle beam and the storedRF energy before it is passed through the accelerating apparatus. Thisphase-coherent particle beam is accelerated by the stored RF energy asit drains this energy from the accelerating apparatus during its passagethrough the accelerating apparatus.</TEXT></DOC>
