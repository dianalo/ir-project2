It allegesthat BankAmerica in effect &quot;continued to conspire&quot; with BCCIby continuing to accept deposits of BCCI funds.   The suit also seeks damages from BCCI's accountants, PriceWaterhouse andamp; Co. and Ernst andamp; Young (as successor to Ernst andamp;Whinney), and numerous principals of BCCI Holdings(Luxembourg) S.A. and its American unit, First AmericanBankshares Inc.   BankAmerica said the allegations against it are &quot;totallyunsupported by any facts or evidence whatsoever.&quot; But it didsay that one reason it sold its BCCI interest was a concernover BCCI's &quot;accounting controls.&quot; A BankAmerica spokesmansaid it also ended its relationship with BCCI because ofdifferences over strategy and credit policies. &quot;The reasonswhy we divested our interests in BCCI had nothing to do withknowledge or suspicion of illegal activity,&quot; he added. &quot;Thislawsuit is a flagrant attempt to assign guilt by association.We plan to seek prompt dismissal from the complaint.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
