(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Toshiba XM-2200 Toshiba drives have been available in the UK for some tiemnow, but with a relatively low profile thanks to a distribution deal fromToshiba Germany via Norbain.andP;  The SCSI-interfaced drives are sold primarilyon performance with a claimed average access time of 350ms - they'recertainly substantially faster than the other drives reviewed here.andM;Norbain sent a Toshiba XM-2200S and an XM-2200A for review.andP;  The company alsoprovided a Toshiba AT-interface SCSI adaptor and a Future Domain PS/2 SCSIadaptor.andP;  Apple interface kits are available, as well as Toshiba laptopinterface cards.andP;  Toshiba CD-ROM drive kits include all the necessarysoftware and hardware -- which is good, because some manufacturers don't.andO;Since this review, Norbain has started distributing all Toshiba CD-ROM driveswith Future Domain SCSI adaptors, which it says are faster.andM;The XM-2200 series includes two external drives and an internal half-height5-1/4-inch drive.andP;  The XM-2200S internal or external drive - which appears tobe the drive IBM is using for its CD-ROM offering - while comparable with theXM-2200A on speed and build quality, is limited by having a single tiny'busy' light, a headphone socket and an awkward three-position volumecontrol.andM;The much better appointed XM-2200A is only available as an external drive anddiffers from the XM-2200S in having a rotary volume control and coloured LEDsfor power, busy and audio indication.andP;  As well as a headphone socket, it hasrear-mounted stereo output connectors for connection to an audio amplifier.andM;The XM-2200A can be stood horizontally or vertically (to conserve space) andit has a secondary door covering the caddy slot to prevent the ingress ofdust.andP;  The caddy is a universal Sony-compatible type.andM;Installation was straightforward, and the documentation - although in theprocess of being tidied up - was more or less complete.andP;  In use, we didnotice some minor problems when DOS issued an 'abort, retry, fail' messagewhile reading a new CD-ROM.andP;  However, it only happened with the toshibaadaptor hosted by an XT-compatible and replying 'retry' always cleared thehitch.andP;  We can't say how the change from a Toshiba interface card to a FutureDomain card will affect this.andP;  Everyone , it seems, is having some problemswith SCSI on CD-ROM but Future is one of the biggest US CD-ROM/SCSI concerns,so we'll wait and see.andM;The XM-2200A is by far the most useful of the Toshiba drives with its fullaudio support, although users who wish to fit an internal drive will have togo for the XM-2200S for the being.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
