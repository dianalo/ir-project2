(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hasbro Inc. announced Monday it hasagreed to purchase certain assets of the indoor-outdoor children'sfurniture and ride-on divisions of financially troubled ColecoIndustries Inc. for $21 million.   Under the agreement, Hasbro officials said it will purchasespecific assets, including inventory and tooling, machinery andequipment and some property rights.   Hasbro will also buy two manufacturing facilities in Amsterdam,N.Y., officials said, where the acquired product lines are produced.   The lines include plastic wading and splashing pools, poolfilers, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and pedal- andbattery-operated cycles.   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in1956, had sales last year of $77 million. The toymaker is based inWest Hartford, Conn.   ``The addition of these products will provide additional balanceand stability to our overall line,'' said Hasbro chairman StephenHassenfeld in a printed release.   The agreement is subject to approval by the board of directorsof both companies.   The deal has been a topic of speculation for more than a month.   Coleco has been trying since March without success torestructure its massive debt.   The company had proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for acombination of new bonds and stock, saying the exchange would saveit millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cashfor the business.   When that plan collapsed, Coleco received short-term financingfrom a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders, to which it owes$103 million.   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kidsdolls and Scrabble board games. It lost $47.4 million in the firstquarter that ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the pastfive years, including $215 million in the last two years.</TEXT></DOC>
