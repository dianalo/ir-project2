For years, the nation's largest convenience-store chainsaw supermarkets steal its customers but was too laden withdebt to mount a defense. Now, flush with cash from its newJapanese owners, 7-Eleven is mounting an offense of its own.</LP><TEXT>   In the convenience-store industry's most ambitiousmarketing assault ever on 24-hour supermarkets, SouthlandCorp. has converted its 50 7-Elevens here in the Texascapital into brightly lighted stores resembling mom-and-popgroceries. Premium prices have been slashed to supermarketlevels and the small-size-only offerings that used to cramshelves have been replaced with economy-size packages. Freshproduce, pasta and sandwiches also have been added. To speedup the sometimes-sluggish checkout process, two clerks workthe cash registers.   With the radical change and a new ad campaign, Southlandhopes to reclaim customers who are finding out thatsupermarket express lanes are often anything but quick. Evenmore fervently, however, it is hoping to attract women, whohave traditionally viewed convenience stores as dingy andunsafe.   Southland is blitzing the city with soothing adsencouraging those who need just a few items to shop 7-Eleven-- a &quot;mellow&quot; alternative to the &quot;long lines&quot; and &quot;negativeenergy&quot; of supermarkets. The campaign's theme: &quot;Supermarketprices without supermarket stress.&quot; Southland has alsoreplaced the video games in its Austin stores with copiersand automatic-teller machines in an attempt to discourageloitering by teen-agers.   Other convenience-store chains, notably NationalConvenience Stores Inc. of Houston, have long beenrefurbishing stores and rethinking their product mix. LikeSouthland, these competitors face a host of industrytroubles: diminishing consumer preference for traditionalsnack foods; declining sales of such industry mainstays astobacco and beer; and proliferating gas-company food martsthat are grabbing an ever-larger share of their sales.   But none is as well-positioned as Southland to make achange. The company has $430 million in hand, the proceeds ofSeven-Eleven Japan Co.'s and Ito-Yokado Co.'s purchase of 70%of Southland following the company's recent bankruptcy-lawreorganization. Most of those funds are earmarked forrenovating and repositioning stores. And Southland officialsare expected to draw heavily on the experience of their newbosses, who have made fresh and fast foods a hallmark of7-Eleven stores in Japan.   But the climb ahead is steep. Consumers aren't used tothinking of 7-Elevens as purveyors of fresh salads. And someobservers doubt the company will ever be efficient enough tomake a profit selling products at supermarket prices. Still,Southland &quot;has no choice&quot; but to try, says Dennis Telzrow, aretail analyst in Dallas with Eppler, Guerin andamp; Turner.&quot;Something along the lines of what Southland's doing has tobe done, and nobody's been doing it long enough to tellwhether it will work,&quot; he says.   By the company's own admission, an ambitious effort likethe one here in Austin should have been launched severalyears ago, when sales growth started to slow. But thecompany's first attempts consisted of little more thancutting a few select prices. In 1987, for example, Southlandslashed the price of milk to almost its cost, hoping toattract new customers. But with nothing else changed,shoppers weren't impressed, and the company ended up onlywith thinner margins. Milk prices went back up.   A more ambitious overhaul was stymied by a big obstacle:no money. Overwhelmed with debt taken on in a $4.9 billionleveraged buyout in 1987, Southland couldn't afford to payall its bills, let alone attempt a major repositioning.Consequently, says Executive Vice President S.R. &quot;Dick&quot; Dole:&quot;For three and a half years we weren't customer-driven as wehad been -- we were driven by financial concerns.&quot;   Luckily, the company's Japanese licensees were willing tobail Southland out. And from the start, the new owners tookan intense interest in Southland. They called board meetingsevery month and communicated almost daily with Clark J.Matthews II, who had been promoted from chief financialofficer to president and chief executive. &quot;By the hour, theywant to know what's going on,&quot; Mr. Matthews says, adding:&quot;They totally believe that retail is detail.&quot;   In approving Southland's Austin experiment, the new ownersoffered a few suggestions, such as emphasizing food; atJapanese 7-Elevens, fresh and fast food accounts for morethan 35% of sales, compared with less than 9% in the U.S.&quot;They never said, `Because we're doing this, you have to,' &quot;says Mr. Dole. &quot;But they asked, &quot;If we can sell more of this,can you?' &quot;   The Austin overhaul began with cosmetic changes, likebrighter lights. Product shelves were lowered and spread outto create a sense of space. Colorful aisle signs wereinstalled, and cigarette racks and other clutter were clearedoff checkout counters.   Next, outdated or slow-moving products were cleared out.In their place came DiGiorna pastas, Contadina pizza,marinated chicken breasts, fresh fruits and vegetables and ahost of bottled waters, as well as sandwiches and salads madefresh daily at a Southland commissary.   To be price-competitive, Southland hired an outside agencyto check prices at local supermarkets. It also installedcredit-card readers at many gas pumps, enabling customers tofill up and pay without ever entering the store, even thoughthe service probably will result in lost merchandise sales.   The changes impressed Debora White, marketing manager foran Austin engineering firm, who even wrote company officialsa congratulatory letter. &quot;I'd complained so much about theold 7-Eleven that I felt obligated to say how great it isthat they're selling marinated chicken and other healthy foodnow,&quot; she says.   But Ms. White could be an unusual consumer. Almost twoyears after National Convenience Store's Mr. Van Horn beganintroducing fresh products, such as pasta and sandwiches, hesays that despite growing success &quot;the perception of thestale old product mix is still hurting us.&quot;   Competitors and industry experts also question whether thecompany can be profitable with low prices. Although 7-Elevensin Japan meet supermarket prices, they also boastsophisticated sales and distribution systems andpoint-of-sale technology that U.S. 7-Elevens don't have andwon't have for years, if ever.   Southland's hope is to increase sales sharply. But, saysSid Doolittle, a Chicago retailing consultant, &quot;I thinkthey'd have to double sales, which would be very, verydifficult to do.&quot;   So far, supermarkets in Austin aren't too concerned. &quot;So{7-Eleven has} finally figured out that customers want freshproducts and convenient service at good prices -- we've knownthat for years,&quot; says Kristy Ozmun, spokeswoman for HEB, aSan Antonio-based grocer.   Southland officials won't say how much the Austin projectcost, or how long the test will last. They stress that theexperiment is just that, and if it fails, they will trysomething else. And while Mr. Matthews says his new bosses&quot;have a longer-term commitment to determining success&quot; thanmost American executives, he adds that &quot;their patience isn'tpassive. They believe in continual improvement.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
