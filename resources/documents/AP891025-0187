Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., both ofLebanese-American descent, are seeking a meeting with Gen. Aoun,the leader of Lebanon's predominantly Christian army who haswithheld his acceptance of the proposal to end the country's14-year civil war, the sources said. They spoke only on conditionof anonymity.   Rahall's office declined to discuss his trip, saying ``we canneither confirm nor deny it, for security reasons.'' A spokesmanfor Ms. Oakar said he could not obtain information about her plans.   The White House, meanwhile, rejected any U.S. attempt toinfluence Aoun. ``That's ... an internal matter for Lebanon and thevarious factions there to deal with,'' said presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater.   President Bush did discuss the prospects for peace in Lebanon intelephone calls Monday and Tuesday with Pope John Paul II,President Francois Mitterrand of France and King Fahd of SaudiArabia, Fitzwater said.   Bush expressed hope the plan ``would be a step in the directionof Lebanese reform,'' said Fitzwater.   The plan, adopted by 63 Lebanese legislators after three weeksof closed-door meetings in Saudi Arabia, would shift politicalcontrol from the Christian minority to the Moslem majority in anattempt to end the country's 14-year civil war.   Aoun, who declared a ``war of liberation'' in March to drive the40,000 Syrian troops from the country, called on the Lebaneselawmakers to reject the plan when it comes up for a vote next monthbecause it fails to set a deadline for a Syrian pullout.   Oakar and Rahall are no strangers to the dangers of Lebanon. In1982 they visited Beirut at the height of the Israeli invasion tooffer their support for the Lebanese people and condemn thefighting.   But State Department officials said the situation now is farmore dangerous because the U.S. Embassy has been evacuated and thetwo lawmakers would be completely dependent for their security ontheir Lebanese hosts.   ``We don't oppose their talking to him (Aoun), but we can'toffer any support or help if they get in trouble,'' said oneofficial, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.   State Department guidelines prohibit travel by Americans toLebanon, in most cases. ``The situation in Lebanon is so dangerousthat no U.S. citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts,''according to the guidelines.   U.S. passports are invalid for travel to Lebanon unless specialpermission is obtained. Violation of this ban can be punishable byimprisonment or a fine, the guidelines say.   There are eight Americans missing in Lebanon, all believed tohave been kidnapped in the past five years by pro-Iranian radicals.   The embassy was evacuated last month after Aoun made veiledthreats to take American hostages in order to draw attention to hisfight for expulsion of the Syrians.</TEXT></DOC>
