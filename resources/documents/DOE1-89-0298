The reactions werefound to be first order. The kinetic parameters were determined fromexperimental data covering conditions of 120-140{sup 0}C, 1-5% sulfuricacid. The results indicated that the hydrolysis reactions are more sensitiveto acid concentration and reaction temperature than the decompositionreaction. A considerable amount of sulfuric acid was neutralize by bufferingcomponents existing in biomass. A correction to account for the lossof acid was therefore necessary in maintaining data consistency.</TEXT></DOC>
