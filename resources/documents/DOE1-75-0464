<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0464 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Level I PM(10) Assessment Package described will allow initial estimatesto be made of the source contributions to PM(10) receptor concentrations.The package consists of the Principal Components Analysis, Chemical MassBalance (CMB), and Industrial Source Complex-Short Term models implementedon IBM/PC compatible microcomputers. The software is applicable to existingdata sets and is consistent with EPA's protocols for application andvalidation of the CMB receptor model and for reconciling differencesamong receptor and dispersion models. The document describes the modelsincluded in the Level I PM(10) Assessment Package, the measurement methodswhich are commonly applied to obtain model input data, and the availabilityof these data in the state of California. A companion users' manual providesstep-by-step instructions on the application of the package to real data.</TEXT></DOC>
