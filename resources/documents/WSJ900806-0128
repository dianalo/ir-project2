The government of the British crown colony announcedrecently that it will legalize the use of satellite dishes inHong Kong but will require communal-dish operators andsatellite broadcasters to first obtain licenses. A ban hadbeen in effect on the installation and use of satellitedishes, although it was enforced only loosely.</LP><TEXT>   The new ruling grants individuals the right to own andoperate a satellite dish for personal use, without a license.Operators of communal dishes, serving more than one viewer,must apply for a license.   The decision will allow HutchVision, a unit of the HongKong trading company Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., to proceed withits plans to offer satellite-broadcasting service in HongKong.   At the same time, some observers said, the requirementthat communal-satellite dishes be licensed marked an attemptto protect Hong Kong Cable Communications, or HKCC, theconsortium that is to operate Hong Kong's firstcable-television service. HutchVision and HKCC have failed toagree on a broadcast-sharing arrangement.   Officials of HKCC, owned by Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., SunHung Kai Properties Ltd., U S West Inc., Shaw Brothers (HongKong) Ltd. and Coditel S.A., couldn't be reached for commenton the government's announcement.   HutchVision said it welcomed the government's ruling.However, an individual close to HutchVision called thedecision far from satisfactory because the requirement thatdishes be licensed in some cases &quot;could be potentiallyrestrictive and prohibitively expensive for the ordinarycitizen.&quot;   Another potential roadblock could be the drafting of theregulations governing satellite broadcasting, which couldtake as long as a year.   Last year, prior to HKCC's winning the cable award, HongKong's Executive Council proposed to legalize the dishes. Butthe government, not wishing to jeopardize the pendingcable-franchise agreement, put the proposal aside. Thesuccessful launch of AsiaSat, Asia's first privately ownedsatellite, rekindled local interest in developing an Asiansatellite-telecommunications industry.   The plan announced recently, though, goes one step furtherthan last year's proposal by also requiring that satellitebroadcasters be licensed. By broadening the regulations, atelecommunications consultant said, the government attemptedto reassure HKCC that it won't allow unchecked competitionfrom satellite broadcasters.   With a commitment to invest between HK$4 billion andHK$5.5 billion (US$515 million and US$708 million) in thecable system, &quot;HKCC might abandon the project if it becomeseconomically unfeasible,&quot; the consultant said.   Added John Ure, a telecommunications expert and researchfellow at Hong Kong University: &quot;The government is committedto a cable system. Cable's capacity is much greater than thatof satellites. It would be a pity for Hong Kong to lose thepossibility of getting cable simply because satellite gets tobroadcast first.&quot; Even so, he noted that from HKCC'sperspective, the government decision on satellite dishes&quot;certainly doesn't give {HKCC} what they wanted, which is tohinder the broadcast of satellite-TV in Hong Kong.&quot;   HKCC has said that it has exclusive rights to all theterritory's cable-related services. It argues that to provideHong Kong viewers with television broadcasting services viasatellite, as HutchVision plans, requires the partial use ofcable services. Communal-satellite dishes, HKCC says, operatelike mini-cable systems, relaying satellite signals from thedishes along cables into the homes of independent viewers.   HutchVision has reserved half of the available capacity onAsiaSat. Last week, it reached an agreement with thesatellite's operator under which HutchVision will pay rent onthe satellite's reserved capacity until year's end. For 1991,full leasing agreements are to be signed or the space will berelinquished.</TEXT></DOC>
