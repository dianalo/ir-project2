MitchellStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PN AMRAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><TEXT>   Pan American World Airways and American Airlines said they will break off their joint frequent-flier program, effective Nov. 1, ending a simmering dispute between the two carriers that began shortly after they merged their programs in June 1986.    In recent weeks, sources at both carriers had indicated that the break was inevitable, because the airlines couldn't agree on how the contract should be carried out. American, which filed suit against Pan Am two months ago, had threatened to pull out of the program as the two carriers disputed financial and other issues.    After Sept. 30, both airlines said, they will resume their own separate frequent-flier programs.    In ending the agreement, New York-based Pan Am Corp., the airline's parent, also ended its participation in linking up with the American's Sabre computer reservation system. A Pan Am spokeswoman said the carrier intends to return to its former independent computer reservation system, while seeking contracts with other airline reservation systems.    Another result of the split is that AMR Corp., the parent of Dallas-based American, also loses the right to bid first on any of Pan Am's assets that may be up for sale in the future. &quot;We never considered that major to begin with,&quot; an American spokesman said, adding, &quot;As we said earlier, we're not interested in Pan Am's assets.&quot;    American said members of its AAdvantage frequent-flier program will continue through Sept. 30 to receive mileage credits for Pan Am flights and to collect Pan Am awards for travel on Pan Am. All travel awards are valid for one year from the date of issue. All Pan Am mileage already posted to AAdvantage accounts will be honored, American said. Members of Pan Am's WorldPass program who accumulated miles under the AAdvantage program may transfer that mileage to their WorldPass accounts through Oct. 31.    Pan Am said AAdvantage members who are current or former WorldPass members have until Oct. 31 to transfer their mileage to the WorldPass program.    Shortly after the joint program was started last year, each airline contended that the other wasn't living up to the terms of the contract. In June, American sued Pan Am in Dallas federal court, alleging that Pan Am owed it $4.4 million in back payments under the joint agreement. Sources at Pan Am said the company held up the payments to put pressure on American. In ending the agreement, a spokesman for American said, the company dropped its suit against Pan Am. A Pan Am spokesman said, &quot;The agreement we reached with American resolves all the points in dispute.&quot;    Pan Am officials had maintained that American hadn't properly serviced WorldPass members, mainly because American hadn't moved promptly to program its Sabre system to automate the administration of the joint program. Pan Am also claimed that American breached the contract when it signed an agreement with Citibank, a unit of New York-based Citicorp, giving the bank's Affinity credit card users bonus mileage credits that could be applied in the joint frequent-flier program.    &quot;That mileage could be flown on Pan Am and American, but American was getting all the revenue in the Citibank agreement,&quot; one Pan Am official said.    In response to Pan Am's accusations, an American spokesman said Friday, &quot;Basically, the Pan Am people know as well as we do that there's no basis for those charges at all. . . . It really isn't worth the effort to continue the arguing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
