But the head of the nation's largest animal rights group called the poll &quot;hardly an unbiased survey.&quot;    Of 1,500 adults surveyed nationwide, 77% said the use of animals in medical research is necessary, while 17% disagreed and 6% weren't sure, the AMA said.    Results of the February survey, conducted by independent pollsters Tarrance-SRI of Houston, were reported recently in American Medical News, the weekly newspaper of the nation's largest organization of doctors.    &quot;I think it's disgraceful they should wish to commission a study to try to turn back the growing tide of public opinion that animals need some protection in the lab, instead of putting that money into improving conditions in the lab,&quot; said Ingrid Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.    She said in a telephone interview that the AMA is leading &quot;the fight to defeat all legislation on Capitol Hill, no matter how minimal, that would affect the living and dying conditions of animals.&quot;    The AMA said its survey indicated that men were more likely than women to believe that use of animals was necessary for progress -- 83% vs. 72%.    Support of animal research also appeared to grow with education and income, the poll found. Of respondents with annual incomes of at least $30,000, 83% approved.    &quot;The American Medical Association has been and will continue to be a very vocal proponent of responsible -- and let me emphasize responsible -- use of animals in medical research,&quot; said James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president.    Respondents were surveyed by telephone in a random sample of residential listings in the U.S. The margin of error of the survey was plus or minus 2.5%, the AMA said.    The AMA's M. Roy Schwarz countered Ms. Newkirk's charge that the poll was biased. Dr. Schwarz, the AMA's assistant executive vice president for medical education and science, also denied that the AMA has tried to thwart efforts to protect laboratory animals.    He said the organization is supporting revision of Agriculture Department guidelines to set higher standards and force improvement in animal facilities. The AMA has called for more humane treatment, he said.    Ms. Newkirk said the immediate goal of her group is to eliminate &quot;gratuitous cruelty&quot; to animals, including testing cosmetics on them, and eventually to try to end all animal lab testing.    &quot;We're realistic enough to see that it's a long march,&quot; said Ms. Newkirk, whose private, not-for-profit group is based in Washington, D.C. It has 150,000 members nationwide, she said.    The AMA in March appealed to doctors and scientists to form the &quot;first line of defense&quot; against a growing movement to ban the use of animals in scientific research.    The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that 17 million to 22 million animals are used annually in biomedical experiments, and that 75% to 90% are rodents.    Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5% of the remainder, with fish, amphibians and birds making up the rest.    Sixty percent of the experiments cause no suffering to the animal, and in 32% of cases, animals receive pain-killing drugs or anesthesia, according to Stephen Smith, a senior scientist with the AMA Department of Drugs division of drugs and toxicology.    In 8% of the cases, the animals suffer pain, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
