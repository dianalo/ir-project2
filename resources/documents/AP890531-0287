Japan, named last week by the Bush Administration for allegedunfair trade practices, led the assault on U.S. trade policy.Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno, who is likely to become hiscountry's prime minister this weekend, said any unilateral Americanaction could undermine confidence in world economic projections.   Britain strongly supported the Japanese position as didrepresentatives of the European Economic Community executive. WestGermany and Canada also expressed concern.   The criticism of the United States was voiced as the foreign,trade and economy ministers of the 24-nation Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development began their annual meeting atthe secretariat's Paris headquarters.   Japan, the only major industrialized nation cited by the UnitedStates, was seeking agreement on language in the OECD's finalcommunique to be issued Thursday criticizing ``discriminatory orunilateral actions contrary to international commitments.''   The communique, however, would not name the United States.   Japan, Brazil and India, were named to the Super 301 list ofcountries that the United States says have discriminatory tradebarriers to U.S. goods or investments.   Super 301 is the name given to a section of the sweeping 1988U.S. trade law, passed by a Congress frustrated with a tradedeficit that totaled nearly $120 billion last year.   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher denied Americans werebacking away from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade andsaid at a news conference the Bush Administration was stronglycommitted to a multilateral approach to trade negotiations.   He said the Americans were telling their trading partners thatthe Super 301 provision was complementary to the GATT process.   But judging by reaction from some European delegates, theAmericans did not appear to be making much headway with theirexplanations.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said unilateraltrading restrictions would not cure the U.S. deficit and ``even thethreat (to use them) endangers the multilateral trading system.''   He said that despite efforts made by the U.S. administration toto limit the list of countries named under Super 301, anxietiesabout the legislation remained.   Howe said it is vital that the United States respect theprinciples of the multilateral trading system.   Two officials of the European Economic Community, FransAndriessen and Henning Christopherssen, also were critical of U.S.trade policy.   Andriessen said the U.S. legislation was not compatible withGATT and called on the ministers to adopt a firm stand regardingthe United States. ``No country has to the right to interpret therules (of trade) on its own,'' he said.   ``I believe the Americans are sincere when they say Super 301 isan instrument to open frontiers, but it is not the rightinstrument,'' he told reporters.   Nicholas Brady, head of the U.S. delegation, did not not referto the controversial legislation in his speech, but called on Japanand West Germany to do more to reduce their trade surpluses or faceincreased protectionism.   He said the United States was moving to promote continued growthfor the world economy, in part by undertaking to reduce its budgetdeficit to $100 billion in 1990.   ``But many in the United states feel we are being urged to actin a vacuum,'' he said. ``U.S. policy alone does not driveinternational economic developments and international policyprescriptions for current problems cannot end with U.S. fiscalaction.''   The dispute over trade policies overshadowed other items on theministers' agenda, such as the surge of the U.S. dollar, inflationrates in member countries and the environment.   Brady expressed concern about the dollar's recent rise againstother major currencies, saying that if it continued it couldundermine efforts to adjust the international economy.</TEXT></DOC>
