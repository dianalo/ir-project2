The seven minutes the Syrian air force pilot spent over Israelbefore landing the MiG-23 supersonic fighter-bomber caused a publicuproar over possible flaws along one of Israel's most sophisticateddefense lines.   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, International Red Crossofficial Ulrich Lenhartz said the Geneva-based organization wastrying to arrange the return of pilot and plane at Syria's request.   Israeli radio stations and most newspapers said the air forcefailed to scramble inteceptors before the plane landed near Haifa,a city of 250,000.   ``There is a question that people justly ask: how and why ithappened that a plane came in without being detected immediately,''Shamir told high school students in Raanana. ``There is aninvestigation regarding this. ... I think that people of Israel,with their experience of many years, can certainly trust and givefull confidence to its air force.   ``Let's not turn an event that should be joyful into a cause forarguments and worries. It's good for Israel that such an important,significant, valuable plane ... abandoned Syria and came to us.''   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron appointed a team toinvestigate, the army command said in a communique. It will lookinto control, anti-aircraft and command operations and report byMonday.   Whether the investigators had power to recommend action againstindividuals who may have failed in their duties was not clear.   Israel's eight leading dailies asked on their front pages howthe pilot, Maj. Adel Basem, 34, managed to land withoutinterference on a crop-dusters' airstrip at Megiddo, 57 miles northof Jerusalem, and spend 20 minutes on the ground before securityofficials arrived.   Davar newspaper said the plane crossed the Golan Heights at analtitude of 100 feet at about 780 mph.   Syria is Israel's implacable foe. Israel annexed the GolanHeights after capturing them from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.   Yaakov Abudi, an airfield official who was the first to meetBasem, quoted the pilot as saying one major reason he defected wasbeing beaten after asking for better housing.   A Syrian official in Damascus said the pilot did not defect buthad to make an emergency landing. Israeli officials denied theplane had technical problems.   An Israeli army spokesman said a Red Cross request to meet Basemwould be examined but added the Red Cross ``routinely visitsdetainees in Israel, and he is not a detainee.''   Officials refused to say where or under what conditions Basemwas staying.</TEXT></DOC>
