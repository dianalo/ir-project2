The action was clearly designed to defuse a potentiallydisruptive trade dispute with Canada. The 1986 lumber pact,which Canada terminated effective Friday, obliged thatcountry to impose a 15% export tax on lumber, or equivalentrevenue-raising measures, to offset subsidies found by anearlier U.S. investigation.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. lumber industry feared that termination of theagreement would enable Canadians to slash prices on lumbershipped to the U.S. But the new U.S. investigation, byraising the possibility of harsh new U.S. duties on theCanadian imports, is expected to discourage Canadians fromcutting prices, and thus should allay for now Americancompanies' fears that cheap Canadian imports will flood thedepressed U.S. market.   &quot;We're pleased with the opportunity to show that enormousCanadian timber subsidies remain,&quot; said C.T. Howlett,chairman of a coalition of U.S. wood producers.   Canada argued that its actions in the lumber trade don'tneed further investigation. &quot;There is no basis&quot; for the U.S.action because &quot;there is no subsidy of Canadian softwoodlumber,&quot; Trade Minister Michael Wilson said in Ottawa.   Privately, Canadian officials were relieved that the U.S.didn't take harsher measures, such as slapping a 15% dutyoutright on Canadian lumber. Lawmakers from the PacificNorthwest had demanded such an action.   If it runs its full course, the investigation can lastuntil the spring. Until then, the U.S. actions won't hurt theCanadians much. Over an 85-day interim period, the U.S.merely will require importers to post bonds for 15% duties onsoftwood shipments from Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, andOntario. Lesser bond requirements of 6.2% will be posted onshipments from Quebec because that province is believed tohave done more to reduce official support for producers.   Imports from British Columbia, by far the largest Canadiansoftwood supplier, won't have any bond requirements becausethat province already has eliminated its subsidies, accordingto U.S. officials. Imports from that province could besubject to duties later if it restores subsidies, though.   After the interim period, the Commerce Department willissue a preliminary ruling on whether the Canadian shipmentsare still subsidized. Importers then will have to pay thelesser of the bond rates or the subsidy rates. If a finalruling calls for a higher rate, it would apply for shipmentsafter the interim period. A negative finding, of course,would free the shipments from any countervailing duties.   U.S. officials said the decision on how to handle theCanadian issue went all the way up to President Bush.Although the Reagan administration had vowed to protect theU.S. lumber industry if Canada backed out of the accord, theBush team didn't want to go so far as to shake Canada'sconfidence in the broader U.S.-Canada free-trade pact.   Canadian opposition parties attacked Prime Minister BrianMulroney's government for being &quot;weak&quot; in reacting to theU.S. move. &quot;Prime Minister Mulroney should today callPresident Bush and indicate our severe displeasure at thisabsolute, abject rejection of the spirit of the free-tradeagreement,&quot; said Sheila Copps, a spokeswoman for the LiberalParty.   Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), speaking for more than 60U.S. senators who had urged Mr. Bush to stand tough on thisissue, said he supported the U.S. action even though it isn't&quot;as much as I had hoped for.&quot;   ---   John Urquhart in Ottawa contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
