Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator andcurrent armed forces commander-in-chief, said sheepishly. &quot;Notroops even went out into the street.&quot;   But as soon as he put Chile's army in a state of alertlast week, the country's democratically elected governmentwent into a frenzy. Top officials huddled late into the nightaround President Patricio Aylwin, wondering whether theexercises weren't really the start of a military rebellion.</LP><TEXT>   They weren't -- but they were more than exercises.Although the incident ended without a shot being fired, itwasn't just a tempest in a tea-pot: It underlines thelingering mistrust between armed forces and civiliangovernments that reign throughout South America, testing thesolidity of the democratic revolution that swept the regionin the past few years.   Military restlessness has appeared in several SouthAmerican countries, underscoring the difficulty ofsubordinating the military to civilian governments and theneed to redefine the role of the armed forces in thepost-dictatorship, post-Cold War era, military analysts say.While they say conditions aren't right for a military coup inany major South American country, the threat of militarydestabilization will be a permanent feature of transitionprocesses while governments and armed forces try to build upmutual trust.   Indeed, the military might be out of the presidentialpalaces they once occupied, but they aren't out of the mindsof the democratically elected presidents who now sit in them.A series of events this past month have brought the militaryback into the forefront of South American political life:   -- In Argentina, an arch-nationalistic army faction stagedits fourth -- and bloodiest -- rebellion in three years. Inwhat President Carlos Menem described as a coup attempt, themutineers seized five buildings, including armed forcesheadquarters in central Buenos Aires; the short-livedrebellion left 14 people dead and 53 wounded.   -- In the tiny former Dutch colony of Suriname, the armytoppled elected president Ramsewak Shankar in an apparentlybloodless Christmas-day coup that makes Suriname the onlySouth American nation with a military regime. The coup leaderpledged to hold elections within 100 days.   -- In Brazil, there is widespread discontent overdeclining salaries and government spending cuts.   Many analysts say a common thread runs through thestirrings: they all are signs of the difficulties experiencedby the armed forces in adjusting to a new domestic andinternational context, and of the civilian governments'slowness in formulating new security policies.   &quot;Latin American armed forces have an identity problem,&quot;says Genaro Arriagada, vice president of Chile's ChristianDemocratic party and an expert on the military. &quot;We're goingto have to discover a new role for the armed forces, and thisisn't just a theoretical problem.&quot;   Indeed, South America has undergone a change as dramaticas Eastern Europe's over the past decade. Only a few yearsago, military men were in power in almost all of SouthAmerica. Armed forces were geared toward fighting internalsubversion. Border conflicts flared.   Today, democracy is largely the rule. The external threatof Communism has subsided, and &quot;there is no {internal} threatto democracy from the left,&quot; says Edgardo Boeninger, a topadviser to Chile's President Aylwin. The idea of open bordersand economic integration is catching on throughout theregion.   This change has stripped the military of much of theirreason for being and has required a re-evaluation of theirsize and functions, analysts say. The world trend towarddisarmament and lower defense spending, combined with thereturn of democracy in South America, should lead to asmaller, professional military whose tasks could includewaging war on drugs and terrorism, patrolling South America'svast and porous borders and helping rebuild the region'santiquated infrastructure.   But this redefining of the military's functions requiresefforts by both sides. &quot;You can define the role of the armedforces, but the armed forces may not like it,&quot; says AndresFontana, an Argentine sociologist specializing in themilitary. &quot;It's like cat food: it may have all the vitaminsnecessary, but the cat may prefer eating fish. It takes timeto get used to a new system, new values and new roles. Itwill need flexibility on both sides. We have to use thismoment productively, reintegrate and reprofessionalize thearmed forces, so that when the hard times come -- which youhave to think of in Latin America -- people don't look to themilitary as an alternative and they {the military} don't seethemselves as one.&quot;   Argentina and Chile will provide quick tests. Argentina'sMr. Menem has been seeking to placate the military bygranting controversial amnesties to members of the armedforces involved in human-rights abuses when they were inpower and dispatching two warships to the Persian Gulf. Butthe recent rebellion shows this isn't enough. Mr. Menem isnow seeking to restructure the armed forces by concentratingunits and closing down installations, but military expertRosendo Fraga calls the plan &quot;inefficient and insufficient.&quot;   At the same time, he is grappling with the after-effectsof the recent rebellion. After first urging the death penaltyfor the leaders, he told reporters yesterday he no longersupports such severity. &quot;There won't be any executions,&quot; hesaid.   Chile's transition is complicated by Gen. Pinochet'scontinued role as commander-in-chief. The recent &quot;exercises&quot;he ordered were seen as an effort to slow congressionalinquiries into alleged corruption under his formerdictatorship as well as investigations into the widespreadhuman-rights abuses committed under his rule. Mr. Aylwin isplaying a delicate balancing act between punishment andmaintaining stability and the next months are expected to betense.   Still, analysts see signs of hope in the recent events.The Argentine rebellion and Chilean tensions ended quicklyand a majority of the armed forces sided with the government.Moreover, although countries like Peru, Brazil and Argentinaare going through severe economic and social problems, no onelooks to the military as an alternative.   &quot;The fact that there wasn't a military reaction {in thosecountries} is very significant,&quot; says Mr. Arriagada. &quot;Adecade ago, with 10% of these problems, they would have takenpower.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
