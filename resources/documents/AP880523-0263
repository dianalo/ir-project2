The plan will be debated in Takeshita's Cabinet in coming weeksand its broad outlines are expected to be confirmed as thedirections of Japan's economy through 1992.   It calls for a wide range of measures to open and deregulateJapan's markets to foreign competition, improved quality of lifefor the 122 million Japanese and greater Japanese aid to poorcountries.   In effect it confirms the shift of the Japanese economy in thelast few years away from exports and toward heightened domesticdemand. Under heavy pressure from trading partners such as theUnited States and Western Europe, Japan has swung toward domesticconsumption as as a way to keep the economy growing and alsorespond to foreign complaints about the country's huge tradesurplus.   Takeshita asked the Economic Council, a task force reporting tothe prime minister, to form a five-year plan last November after hesucceeded Yasuhiro Nakasone. For six months, 123 prominent Japaneseheld more than 70 meetings to draft the plan, which has theprovisional name Economic Management Within The Global Context.   It says Japan's main problems are how to reduce its tradesurplus, which goverment figures showed at $76 billion last year,down from $89.7 billion in 1986; how to improve the quality of lifein Japan; and how to promote balanced economic and socialdevelopment within Japan.   The three problems ``can all be resolved by promoting andconsolidating the shift to a domestic-demand-led economy,'' it said.   The plan does not set a target for reduced trade surpluses, butsays they should reach ``internationally harmonious levels duringthe period of the plan.''   The yen has doubled in value against the U.S. dollar in the pastthree years, making Japanese goods more costly and difficult tosell abroad and increasing sales of foreign goods in Japan.   The trend should be promoted, the plan said, by measures to makeJapan ``a land of business opportunity for the world at large.'' Itstressed such areas as tariffs, import restrictions, standards andcertification requirements as needing liberalization.   The plan said ensuring better housing is the ``biggest issuefacing Japan'' on the domestic front. Working people in the Tokyoarea should be able ``to secure quality housing at commutabledistances and reasonably priced in terms of income.''   The strength of the yen has propelled Japan to great nationalwealth, but the Japanese complain that their small houses andcommutes of over an hour on jammed subways lead to a poor qualityof life, and that consumer prices are high by internationalstandards.   The plan predicts that inflation will be kept to 1.5 percentannually and says the heavily managed pricing structures should bechanged to narrow the gap between Japanese and international prices.   Taking up one of Takeshita's favorite themes, the plan calls formeasures ``to escape the over-dependence on the Tokyo area and torevitalize non-Tokyo economies.''   Metropolitan Tokyo, with 12 million people, is the hub ofgovernment and business activity. The plan says some governmentoffices should relocate outside Tokyo and there should be majorinvestment in rapid-transit systems to encourage dispersal of thepopulation, business and industry into other centers.   Overall, the plan predicts 3.75 percent economic growth annuallyduring the five-year period. Of that, domestic demand would provide4.25 percent growth and foreign demand would drop by 0.5 percentannually, it predicts.   Japan's post-World War II economic surge was largely based onexports, and the chairman of the Economic Council, Gaishi Hiraiwa,said he expected vigorous debate on the plan's emphasis on domesticdemand.   Attaining the goals will mean ``pain and burden to the people atlarge,'' Hiraiwa, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co., toldreporters at a briefing. ``Therefore, I believe that theunderstanding and cooperation of the Japanese people are neededmore than ever.''   The plan also calls for tax reforms. The government is movingsteadily toward reducing income taxes and introducing taxes onconsumption, like sales taxes or European-style, value-added taxes.Takeshita has said he will introduce new tax legislation thissummer.</TEXT></DOC>
