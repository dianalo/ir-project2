Contents of study are as follows: (1) Survey onpossible amount of biomass resources utilization (Concept of biomass.Biomass resources in Japan and the potential district. Possibility andutilization of potential biomass resources by energy conversion). (2)Survey on biomass energy conversion (Liquid fuel. Gas fuel. Other technology).This survey was made in 1986. What are described are: Annual amount ofenergy in Japan obtained from plants and biological waste is 275 trillionkcal based on methane. Apart from this, flow of utilization of biomass,type and features of the utilizing method, system diagram of biomassresources, and total system of bioenergy. (6 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
