The United Nations has mounted its most extensive and costlyoperation to monitor the week of voting and ballot-counting inAfrica's last colony, most of it sparsely populated desert.   The election for a constitution-writing assembly will beadministered by South Africa, which agreed last year to end its74-year rule over Namibia. Officials from 25 countries will observethe voting, along with monitors from the 7,650-member U.N. forcethat has been deployed in the territory since April at the cost ofsome $450 million.   Voting is to take place Tuesday through Saturday, with resultsexpected early next week. The 701,483 registered voters will bechoosing among 10 parties and casting ballots at 350 pollingstations.   With an illiteracy rate of 60 percent, confusing ballot symbolsfor the parties, intricate voter identification procedures, and thepresence of up to 25 observers at each polling station, there is astrong possibility of disputes or delays before the outcome isknown.   The focus of the election is whether the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization, or SWAPO, which fought a 23-year guerrillawar against South African rule, will win two-thirds of the 72assembly seats, enough to write the constitution withoutcompromising with other parties.   SWAPO's leaders are known as Marxists and once threatened to setup ``re-education camps'' for policemen and politicians who servedthe territorial government. But since returning from three decadesof exile, SWAPO leaders have preached reconciliation among the morethan 1.3 million people _ including 75,000 whites _ spread over318,252 square miles.   Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the top-ranking U.N. official inNamibia, is charged with declaring whether the elections meet theU.N. requirement of being ``free and fair.''   Many Namibians mistrust the United Nations because the worldbody for years designated SWAPO as the sole representative of theNamibian people. It lifted that designation early this year.   U.N. Resolution 435, which outlines the independence process,calls for the constitution to include a bill of rights, independentjudiciary, periodic elections, multiple parties and free speech.SWAPO has accepted those principles as ``guidelines,'' but itselection manifesto is contradictory and unspecific on those andother issues, such as a free press and land redistribution.   The United Nations has never specified the exact procedure fordeclaring independence and forming a new government.   If all goes well, a new government will take power early nextyear, ending South Africa's rule over the former German colonywhich also is known as South-West Africa.   But all has not gone well, so far.   On April 1, the first day of the U.N.-supervised transitionperiod, hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas crossed the border fromAngola, violating agreements and triggering battles that reportedlykilled 340 men.   The United Nations brought home more than 41,000 refugees,mostly SWAPO supporters, from a dozen countries to take part in theelection.   Some of the returnees said they had been tortured in SWAPO campsand falsely accused of being South African spies. A U.N.investigation revealed that 315 people alleged to have beendetained by SWAPO were missing and 100 were dead.   The four-month election campaign has been marked byintimidation, fighting at political rallies, the assassination ofSWAPO's only white executive member, and attacks on U.N. forces andjournalists.   Five days before the election, South African Foreign MinisterPik Botha threatened to delay the voting and call South Africanforces from their bases to deal with another alleged incursion bySWAPO from Angola. SWAPO and the United Nations said Botha'scharges were baseless.</TEXT></DOC>
