Because of continuing losses, the securities concern has said it plans to sell its remaining assets, mainly its retail brokerage network, and cease operations.    The company also reiterated that after it pays creditors, holders likely will get nothing from the liquidation.    No one at Moseley was available for comment yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
