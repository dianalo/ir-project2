The letter is nearly long enough to wrap around the Vincennes,according to a statement issued by U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif.,who organized the signature drive.   Among those signing the letter was former Marine Lt. Col. OliverNorth, one of the principals charged in the Iran-Contra scandal.   The letter was put aboard a commercial airliner Monday and isexpected to arrive Wednesday in Bahrain for delivery to the crewand officers aboard the San Diego-based ship, which has remained inthe Persian Gulf since Iran Air Airbus A300 was shot down.   All 290 aboard were killed in the July 3 accident, which U.S.officials said was a case of mistaken identity.   The letter was hand painted on a poster approximately12-feet-square. The signatures, many accompanied by personalmessages, were scribbled on rolls of 3-foot-wide butcher paper.   The letter said:   ``To Capt. Will Rogers III and the crew of the USS Vincennes,the citizens of our home port San Diego show our strong support toyou as you strive to do your duty to God and country in troubledwaters far from home. You have our best wishes during a difficulttime and we pray for fair winds and following seas in the future.Good luck and Godspeed.''   Lowery said the signature campaign was conducted over theweekend in various spots around San Diego.   ``I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support,'' he said. ``Inone weekend almost 10,000 people took the time to stand up and becounted for the Vincennes.''   The Vincennes is expected to end its six-month deployment andreturn to San Diego in October.</TEXT></DOC>
