Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, appearing at apress conference with American Legion national commander H.F.Gierke, said legislation calling for the amendment has beenscheduled for Senate floor action Oct. 16.   The House will consider a bill Sept. 12 that would create afederal law against flag desecration, but not amend the Constitution.   ``It's a long process,'' Dole said of the amendment route, whichrequires approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate andratification by three-fourths of the states.   But, he said, the issue was one that deserved consideration bythe states.   Gierke said that the legion was getting about 40,000 signatures aday in its nationwide petition drive, which still goes on.   ``The constitutional process requires constitutional assuranceswe'll do the right thing,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who alsoappeared at the news conference.   Proponents of the amendment say it, rather than a statute, isneeded so that the Supreme Court will not rule the prohibitionunconstitutional. Earlier this year, the court touched off thecontroversy by deciding that burning the flag was a constitutionallyprotected form of political protest.   Many lawmakers and constitutional law experts oppose theamendment, saying that while emotionally offensive, flag-burning isnot a serious enough offense to merit curtailment of free-speechprotections.   The House bill includes penalties of up to a year in prison plusan unspecified fine for physically desecrating a flag, and wasdrafted to address the high court's decision that existing statutesagainst flag burning were an attempt to squelch free speech.   Reps. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., who alsoattended the news conference, said the fight in the House for anamendment would be much tougher than in the Senate.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has said theDemocrats want to try a statute before a constitutional amendment toavoid ``adding political graffiti to the Constitution.''</TEXT></DOC>
