The Viralarm system was announced Tuesday by officials ofLasertrieve Inc. of Metuchen, N.J., during a Microsoft Corp.conference on a data-storage device known as CD-ROM, short forcompact disk, read-only memory.   A statement issued by Lasertrieve said that although the newerCD-ROM disks are impervious to corruption because information onthem cannot be altered, many computer users are concerned aboutprotecting programs on hard disks or on conventional floppydiskettes.   Viruses are creating a growing fear among computer owners andusers. Authorities in Israel recently announced the detection of avirus that, if left to spread unchecked, could have wiped outmemory banks and disabled computers throughout the country on agiven date.   Previous ``anti-viral'' programs only drew attention to changes,noted the size of a program or monitored the dates of programchanges, and all were ``easily fooled by sophisticated viruses,''the statement said.   Viralarm consists of a special program to protect anotherprogram, creating a software barrier.   Before anyone can use the protected program, Viralarm checks todetermine whether the program has been altered since it wasinoculated. If there has been any change, Viralarm then blocks useof the altered program, notifies the user and suggests a backupcopy of the program be substituted.   The protection is available for individual personal computersand works for most of the operating systems now available, theLasertrieve statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
