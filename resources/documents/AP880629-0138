The legislation, sponsored by committee Chairman Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., would raise the wage rate to $4.55 per hour overthree years, identical to a proposal being considered by Houseleaders.   Although several Republican senators earlier had said they wouldoffer amendments to the bill, none was introduced at the meeting.   ``There was no reason to take on those issues in committee,''said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``There will be amendments whenthe bill gets to the floor.''   An earlier proposal, introduced in both the House and Senate,would have increased the wage to $4.65 per hour over three yearsand indexed it to 50 percent of the average national wagethereafter.   The House, during subcommittee and full committee action,dropped the indexing provision and boosted the rate to $5.05 perhour over four years.   When the legislation goes to the House floor, there is expectedto a bipartisan substitute proposal to bring the minimum wage to$4.55 per hour over three years.</TEXT></DOC>
