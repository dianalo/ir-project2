Inso doing, the protesters defied the ban on strikes anddemonstrations declared by the self-proclaimed &quot;StateCommittee on the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R.&quot; -- thehandful of men that has seized power in the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   Who are the eight men who have taken matters into theirown hands? Without exception, they are hard-liners. All butone (a representative of the collective-farm peasantry) havedirect links with the military, the secret police or thedefense industry. None is young. All but two are ethnicRussians (Oleg Baklanov is Ukrainian; Boris Pugo is Latvian).All, without exception, are unpopular figures with thegeneral public.   Furthermore, all are members of the Communist Party. Andyet there is no one on the Emergency Committee who is therepurely because of his party affiliation. The message of thisfact is that the coup represents not Communist ideology, butthe naked interests of the Soviet military-industrialcomplex.   The Emergency Committee is headed by 54-year old GennadyYanayev, the man Mr. Gorbachev nominated last December to thenew post of deputy president of the U.S.S.R. Mr. Yanayev'scandidacy was unpopular and Mr. Gorbachev even had tostruggle to force his election through the Soviet Union'spredominantly hard-line Parliament. Members of theparliamentary opposition, the Interregional Group ofDeputies, alleged that the vote was rigged.   Mr. Yanayev made his career in the apparatus of theCommunist Party and the Soviet Union's official trade unions-- notorious for their consistent support of the interests ofthe state and their neglect of the country's long-sufferingworking class.   His early career saw him working for organizations thathave clear links with the KGB. In 1968, when he was 31, Mr.Yanayev was appointed head of the U.S.S.R. Committee of YouthOrganizations -- a group that controlled international frontorganizations such as the World Federation of DemocraticYouth. In 1980, he became deputy chairman of the Union ofSocieties for Friendship and Cultural Relations With ForeignCountries. Both of these posts would have required a closeworking relationship with the secret police.   Mr. Yanayev's dull exterior suggests he is a graybureaucrat. In reality he is a shrewd man who has made nosecret of his opposition to Mr. Gorbachev's market-orientedeconomic reforms, which, he warned last year, werethreatening the Soviet Union with &quot;civil war.&quot; But Mr.Yanayev has no independent power base and cannot beconsidered the moving force behind the coup that ousted Mr.Gorbachev.   The moving force is not, in fact, an individual. It is themilitary-industrial complex -- the network of interestsrepresented by the military, the secret police, and thedefense industry. The disintegration of the Soviet stateprecipitated by Mr. Gorbachev's liberalizing reforms strikesdirectly at the interests of this complex, which, until Mr.Gorbachev's rise to power, enjoyed priority access to scarceresources.   The real powers on the Emergency Committee are DefenseMinister Dmitry Yazov, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov (bothage 67), and Interior Minister Boris Pugo (age 54), also amajor-general in the KGB. Another key figure is PrimeMinister Valentin Pavlov -- an economist who shocked theworld earlier this year when he warned of a Western &quot;plot&quot; toundermine the U.S.S.R.'s financial position.   The interests of the Soviet Union's defense industry willbe well protected by the Emergency Committee. Its keyrepresentative on the committee is Oleg Baklanov (aged 59),an armaments specialist who in the 1970s was involved in theproduction of spacecraft and ballistic missiles. Until now hehas held the post of first deputy chairman of the SovietDefense Council -- the Soviet Union's main decision-makingbody regarding defense issues.   Indeed, one of the first acts of the Emergency Committeeyesterday was to take over the powers of the Defense Council.The interests of the defense industry are also represented onthe committee by Alexander Tizyakov, president of theAssociation of State-Owned Industrial, Construction,Transport, and Communications Enterprises, which representsthe specific interests of plants in the defense sector.   At a stormy meeting attended by Mr. Gorbachev in theKremlin last December, Mr. Tizyakov called on Mr. Gorbachevto slow down his economic reforms, declare a countrywidestate of emergency and pass power to a &quot;Committee of NationalSalvation.&quot; When Mr. Gorbachev tried to reply, he was shouteddown.   The eighth member of the Emergency Committee is VasilyStarodubtsev, chairman of the Peasants' Union, set up lastyear by Mr. Gorbachev's erstwhile opponent, Yegor Ligachev,to oppose the reform of Soviet agriculture. Only a few weeksago, Mr. Starodubtsev called for a &quot;coup&quot; to prevent theprivatization of land. Both he and Mr. Tizyakov weresignatories of the notorious &quot;Word to the People,&quot; amanifesto calling for a military coup and the introduction ofemergency rule that was published in the newspaper SovetskayaRossiya on July 23.   The members of the Emergency Committee share one moretrait: They have misjudged the mood of the Soviet people. AsPresident George Bush told a press conference soon after newsof the coup was received, it is important not tounderestimate the changes that have taken place in the SovietUnion in recent years. Changes in the levels of education,urbanization and expectations of the general public haveturned the Soviet Union from a homogeneous, predominatelypeasant society into an increasingly heterogeneous one with agrowing middle class, an educated work force, an alienatedyounger generation and a growing democratic movement. Most ofthese social changes predate the democratization that Mr.Gorbachev launched in 1985.   Coups, as President Bush stressed yesterday, can fail ifthey &quot;run up against the will of the people.&quot; The resolutionof the struggle between the forces of hard-line communism andthose of reform lies today in the hands of the Sovietpopulation.   ---   Ms. Teague is an analyst with the Radio Free Europe/RadioLiberty Research Institute in Munich.</TEXT></DOC>
