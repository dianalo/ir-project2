Other options let COBOL/2 Workbench developerswork with the Microsoft Editor and CodeView debugger.andM;Developers also have the option of debugging with animated structurediagrams, which place a block diagram of the program in an on-screen window,highlighting the transfer of control between various parts of the program asthe developer steps through the code.andM;An Animator session can activate the Analyzer utility, which displays thenumber of times each source line has been executed.andP;  This information can bedisplayed numerically or in bar-graph fashion, with different colorshighlighting concentrations of activity.andM;The COBOL Source Information (CSI) utility can trace a variable from itsinitial definition through all the lines where it is modified and used.andO;Visual flags mark the corresponding source lines, and the developer cansuppress &quot;uninteresting&quot; lines to simplify navigation through large programs.andM;The CSI utility also supports higher-level requests, such as theidentification of variables that are defined but never used.andM;The Workbench lived up to its promise of hiding the modularization of thevarious development tools.andP;  Work moved smoothly from one facility to another,addressing developers' demands for convenient sequential integration betweenthe components of CASE environments.andM;This convenience must not come at the expense of flexibility.andP;  COBOLdevelopers have well-established habits and preferences.andM;COBOL/2 Workbench addresses this requirement with its open architecture,giving programmers free access to the very tools used to create the product(such as the menu handler, Help interface and overall configuration system).andO;An alternate menu, for example, can easily be added to the standard mastermenu, letting the developer link the Workbench with favorite third-partytools.andM;This impressive product is documented by a neatly packaged set of 12 manuals,in sizes ranging from the massive Language Reference -- with 15 chapters and10 appendices -- to the Pocket Guide, which summarizes language, command-linesyntax, development environment and system messages in a shirt-pocketpaperback.andM;Once installed, the product can go in two directions: It can be used as aself-contained PC development environment, or as a productivity workstationfor developers whose primary platform is the mainframe.andP;  A separate manualtargets each type of user: a PC Programmer's Guide for development, testingand packaging of applications; and a Mainframe Programmer's Guide emphasizingmainframe-compatible development.andM;This two-track approach carries through to the on-line environment as well,with separate predefined menu systems.andP;  The Workbench Developer's Environmentsupports development with PC-based source for a PC delivery system; theMainframe Developer's Environment, however, uses mainframe-oriented defaultsettings, such as the EBCDIC character set rather than PC-standard ASCII, andmainframe-compatible directives for system utilities.andM;During evaluation, the only difficulty encountered with COBOL/2 Workbench wasa conflict between the Micro Focus XM extended-memory manager and theextended-memory version of Golden Bow Systems' Vcache 3.1 disk-cache utility.andO;(This produced a number of bizarre effects, including what looked likecorruption of DOS directories, which fortunately disappeared afterrebooting.)andM;In the absence of pervasive standards for extended-memory management underDOS, this cannot be considered a bug.andP;  It is, though, a warning toprospective users of any product that shares extended memory with adisk-management utility, where software conflicts over the extended-memoryarea could destroy critical file system information.andM;Micro Focus belies COBOL's mainframe heritage with the artful design of theWorkbench environment, which could give some lessons to PC developers.andP;  Thebottom-line menu, for example, displays function-key assignments, which isnothing new; the menu updates instantly, however, when the user presses theCtrl or Alt key, thereby putting as many as three functions on a key with noneed for cumbersome templates.andM;Overall, the Micro Focus COBOL Workbench is professionally crafted, superblydocumented and equipped to support the experienced developer while stillassisting the relative novice.andM;Micro Focus can be reached in Palo Alto, Calif., at (800) 872-6265.andM;Caseworks Inc. first captured the attention of PC software developers withits CASE:W and CASE:PM , two graphically oriented tools that let developerscraft Windows or Presentation Manager programs.andP;  CASE:PM for COBOL paves theway for migrating traditional business applications to the Common User Accesslook and feel that IBM defines as part of System Applications Architecture.andM;PC Week looked at prerelease version 2.04 of CASE:PM for COBOL.andM;The Caseworks graphical prototyping environment creates an .APP (application)file that serves as a database of application requirements, which includes adescription of the user interface and a supporting data dictionary.andM;This is then applied against a .KNB (knowledge base) file for a particularlanguage to generate application source code in that language.andM;These .KNB files represent proprietary knowledge and are normally distributedin an encrypted form, but PC Week was able to examine knowledge-base sourcecode for CASE:PM for COBOL.andM;Peering into Caseworks' knowledge-base format is like reading a tutorial byan experienced programmer: &quot;When you need to this, you can code it like so.&quot;andO;Planned source licensing of the knowledge-base files will let advanceddevelopment shops extend the Caseworks tools to reflect their own experience.andM;Another strength of the Caseworks tools is the way they preserve theprogrammer's modifications to automatically generated code.andP;  Primitive codegenerators can only be used for the first pass of prototyping; as soon as theprogrammer makes any refinements to the generated code, further maintenancemust be done at the source-code level to avoid losing these changes.andM;The Caseworks tools, by contrast, take notice of &quot;manual&quot; adjustments totheir generated output, preserving changes across subsequent &quot;regenerations&quot;of the program code.andP;  This makes all the difference between using CASEtechniques only for first-pass design and using them throughout thedevelopment cycle.andM;CASE:PM is not a compiler, but a source-code generator; actual source codemust be processed by a third-party compiler.andP;  Applications built with CASE:PMfor COBOL will have to wait for compiler vendors to support advanced OS/2features not currently supported by PC-based COBOL compilers, such asmultiple threads.andM;CASE:PM for COBOL can generate error-free code; it also preserves thedeveloper's adjustments to that code.andM;In its prerelease form, CASE:PM for COBOL costs $1,995.andP;  The forthcomingcommercial release version, priced at $2,495, will be available free tobuyers of the prerelease version.andM;Caseworks can be reached in Atlanta at (404) 399-6236.andP;  -- Peter CoffeeandM;Despite their different approaches, the mere existence of Micro Focus Inc.'sCOBOL/2 Workbench, Caseworks Inc.'s CASE:PM for COBOL and Texas InstrumentsInc.'s Information Engineering Facility (IEF) suggests that COBOL's best daysare still to come -- a surprising conclusion, perhaps, given the scorn oftenheaped by PC developers on this lumbering giant of a language.andM;&quot;You should not honor the dead by putting them on your payroll,&quot; observe MarcStiegler and Bob Hansen in their book, &quot;Programming Languages: Featuring theIBM PC and Compatibles.&quot;andM;&quot;COBOL was designed for business applications, where the flow of control wassimple, the mathematics were trivial and the output format wasall-important,&quot; the authors write.andM;This vehement opinion too quickly dismisses a major and continuing need.andO;Those same three characteristics still dominate much of present-dayapplications development, particularly if the graphical user interface isconsidered part of the &quot;all-important&quot; output format.andM;Simplifies Tool-BuildingandM;Furthermore, these authors take for granted the two essential features of abusiness application: correctness in the first release and ease of reliablemaintenance through later revisions.andP;  The formal structure of COBOL makes ittedious to work with &quot;by hand,&quot; but it greatly simplifies the task ofbuilding powerful computer-based tools to aid the developer.andM;&quot;People say they don't want to go back to COBOL,&quot; said an executive atHouston-based Texas Instruments &quot;Fine -- they don't have to.andP;  With IEF, theydon't edit code, they edit an action diagram.&quot;andM;In the same way that programmers generate efficient machine code through thehigh-level model of C, they can also generate and maintain their ownlow-level solutions through high-level productivity tools for COBOL.andM;The Micro Focus Workbench features high-level tools for debugging; CASE:PMsimplifies the development of the user interface; IEF supports the entiremodel of identifying business needs and crafting their software solutions.andO;Each is built on the proven technology of COBOL, the business developer'scustomary foundation.andP;
