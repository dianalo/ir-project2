Israel said its troops had moved into Israel's self-declaredsecurity zone in southern Lebanon.   ``The army is combing the security zone because of increasingattempts to infiltrate into Israel for purposes of murder andhostage-taking,'' an Israeli military communique said.   It did not say how long the operation would last or how manytroops were involved. The communique was issued by the military inthe northern Israeli town of Metulla.   The army censored other details about the operation.   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 500 to 1,500Israeli soldiers were dispatched to the border region before theoperation began.   Lebanese police said reports from the Arkoub region in thefoothills of Mount Hermon indicated at least three suspectedguerrillas had been seized by the Israelis in the late eveningoperation.   The area is in the western sector of the Syrian-controlled BekaaValley.   ``We have no information yet about the size of the attackingforce or the distance it covered in the penetration,'' said aspokesman at Lebanon's police headquarters in Beirut. He was notidentified in line with police regulations.   He declined comment on a report by NBC News that said about2,000 Israeli troops had crossed into Lebanon in search ofPalestine Liberation Organization guerrillas and their strongholds.   Last week, Palestinian guerrillas entered northern Israel fromsoutheastern Lebanon in two different incursions. Five guerrillasand two soldiers were killed in fights with Israeli army patrols.   There have been 12 infiltrations or attempted infiltrationssince Nov. 25, when a Palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glidernear a military base and killed six soldiers before being shot todeath.   Israeli officials said recent cross-border raids probably werelinked to the five months of anti-Israeli demonstrations in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   An Arab youth died Sunday when he was electrocuted whileclimbing a utility pole at the West Bank village of Beit Wazan.Hospital officials reported relatives of the victim, NidalAbdulhak, 16, said he was killed when Israeli troops ordered him toclimb the pole to remove a Palestinian flag.   The army said Abdulhak apparently was trying to hang the flag,which is outlawed by Israel.   His death brought the number of Arabs killed since the uprisingbegan Dec. 8 to at least 177. An Israeli soldier and Jewish settleralso have been slain in the violence.   There have been reports of an Israeli military buildup sinceguerrilla incursions last week. The Israeli military censor onMonday prevented journalists in Israel from reporting details aboutthe buildup.   Israeli officials have blamed Syria for the cross-borderguerrilla attacks on grounds the guerrillas were from the BekaaValley that is controlled by Syrian forces.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,was asked about the report of 2,000 Israeli soldiers crossing intoLebanon.   ``An operation of that magnitude would have to through theUNIFIL area and we see nothing,'' he told The Associated Press inJerusalem by telephone from his headquarters in the the Lebaneseborder town of Naqoura.   ``In the area we see and control we don't see anything,'' Gokselsaid. UNIFIL has peacekeeping units in southern Lebanon.   The police spokesman said the attacking force was supported bymilitiamen of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, apredominantly Christian paramilitary contingent in control ofIsrael's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.   Squadrons of Israeli air force jet fighters soared over southLebanon's two major cities of Sidon and Tyre, dropping parachuteflares and staging mock divebombing runs on Palestinian refugeecamps, the spokesman said.   The drone of warplane engines also was heard over Beirut, theLebanese capital. But there have been no reports of bombing sorties.   The Israeli military said that last Wednesday, two Palestinianguerrillas from Lebanon crossed Israel's border and wounded a truckdriver before they were trapped in a ravine and slain by an armypatrol. No army casualties were reported.   An army statement said documents found on the dead guerrillasshowed they planned to take hostages to exchange for Arab prisonersin Israeli jails.   The day before, three guerrillas crossed the border at the samepoint and were spotted by an army patrol. The army said the threeguerrillas and two soldiers were killed in a gunfight.</TEXT></DOC>
