On issues such as on-site inspections and European missilereductions, he has made such significant concessions over previous Sovietpositions that questions have been raised, and not satisfactorily answered,about how much support Gorbachev's diplomacy enjoys among the Sovietmilitary. For example, have Gorbachev's proposals been a bold personalgamble to achieve agreement without the prior approval of the Sovietmilitary bureaucracy? Or does his arms control diplomacy represent abroad consensus among the military leadership and a realignment of Sovietmilitary doctrine and grand strategy? A careful examination of recentSoviet military thought shows that such a consensus exists. A broad andstable coalition of key military leaders supports the General Secretary'spolicies. Moreover, recent Soviet concessions are not, as commonly argued,a stopgap ploy to halt the US Strategic Defense Initiative or Star Wars.Rather, the military's support for Gorbachev's arms-control diplomacyis based on some serious strategic analysis and stems from broad, fundamental,and enduring changes in Soviet national security policy.</TEXT></DOC>
