Introduction</ITAG>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is proposinga policy statement for the implementation of interim gas inventory chargesfor pipelines while the Commission considers individual pipeline applicationsfor permanent gas inventory charges.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>On August 7, 1987, the Commission issued Order No. 500 in which it adoptedan interim rule and statement policy dealing with, among other things,the take or pay problems of the gas pipeline industry.\1\<NOTE/> The Commission established a ``one time only'' mechanismof equitable sharing for the treatment of past take or pay costs, whichexpired March 31, 1989. In addition, Order No. 500 adopted a policy, codifiedin andSection; 2.105 of the Commission's regulations, with respect to ``theparameters in which a pipeline may file to recover the costs of maintainingsupply for their customers.''\2\<NOTE/> As set forth in andSection; 2.105, the gas supply or inventorycharge for standing ready to supply gas must be in accordance with thefollowing principles:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,761.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 30,792.(a) The pipeline may not recover take-or-pay or similar charges from suppliersby any other means.(b) The pipeline must allow its sales customers to nominate levels of servicefreely within their firm sales entitlements or otherwise employ a mechanismfor the renegotiation of levels of service at regular intervals.(c) The pipeline must announce prior to nominations by the customers afirm price or pricing formula for the service, and hold that price or pricingformula firm during the interval arranged in paragraph (b) of this section.(d) By nominating a new level of service lower than its current level,a customer has consented to any abandonment sought by the pipeline commensuratewith the difference between the current level of service and the nominatedlevel.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 18 CFR 2.105 (1988).Although the Commission has issued certificates authorizing gas inventorycharges (GICs), to date, no pipeline has implemented a gas inventory charge.\4\<NOTE/> As a general matter, the Commission believes that in thecurrent economic and regulatory environments for the natural gas industry,it is in the public interest for interstate gas pipelines to implementGIC mechanisms as soon as possible in order to prevent a reoccurence ofthe take or pay problems of the past. A GIC is the most effective way toaccomplish this objective.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ To date, three vastly different gas inventory charge proposalshave been approved by the Commission. Transwestern Gas Pipeline Co., 43FERC andpara; 61,240 (1988), certificate pending acceptance; Natural GasPipeline Company of America, 44 FERC andpara; 61,163 (1988), certificaterejected; and Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 44 FERC andpara; 61,413 (1988,<T3>reh'g denied,</T3> 47 FERC andpara; 61,100 (1989), certificate accepted.Currently pipelines cannot reflect the cost of maintaining inventoriesof gas supplies in their rates on a current basis. This proposed policystatement addresses that problem. The Commission believes that providingfor interim implementation of the gas inventory charge mechanism will benefitboth pipelines and their customers by enabling them to plan and coordinatetheir relationship and their relationships with others pursuant to currentneeds and to contract for a portfolio of gas supplies within the frameworkof a rational, efficient pricing structure. As the Commission stated inOrder No. 500:<ITAG tagnum="21">The rate design is intended as a future-looking mechanism to recoverthe costs of contractually committing gas service that has been tailoredto meet the customer's nominations whenever fewer than nominated volumes(or a reasonable percentage of nominated volumes) are taken by a customer,who is fully aware that such charges would be <T3>currently</T3> assessed on a monthly basis, based on its own servicenomination. In brief, the Commission is seeking to establish a rational,efficient pricing structure for the pipeline merchant function with emphasison reciprocity and consideration of service obligations under the increasedoptions available to a pipeline's sales customers.\5\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 30,794.The Commission's experience to date has been that the establishment ofa permanent gas inventory charge that relies on the market to establishthe prices to be charged involves an inquiry that can be quite time consuming.The Commission is attempting currently to deal with this dilemma.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> El Paso Natural Gas Company, 47 FERC andpara; 61,108 (1989).The purpose of this proposed policy statement is to propose methods fordeveloping a limited term gas inventory charge, and to set forth relatedterms and conditions of service, for use on an interim basis until individualpipelines implement permanent gas inventory charges. The Commission hasbeen concerned for some time about take or pay obligations in the naturalgas industry. That is why the Commission issued Order No. 500. The Commissionsees an interim GIC as a bridge between the expiration of one phase ofaddressing the take or pay problem_the equitable sharing direct billingmechanism_and the beginning of the next phase of dealing with future accumulationsof take or pay_the implementation of gas inventory charges_throughout thegas pipeline industry.The Commission's intent is to avoid the reoccurence of significant amountsof unfunded pipeline take or pay costs. A pipeline must maintain adequategas supplies to meet its entire service obligation. The Commission recognizesthat if a mechanism does not exist to compensate a pipeline for maintainingthese gas supplies, it will have a negative impact on the ability of thepipeline to serve as a merchant. For this reason, the Commission recognizesthat action is needed in the near term to allow pipelines to put in placean interim GIC.The proposed policy statement details several possible methods for developingan interim gas supply charge and a limited term gas inventory charge. Theremay be other equally appropriate methods that could be used. The Commissionis interested in receiving comments on the methods outlined herein, aswell as on any other method the commenters may wish the Commission to consider.The Commission understands that factual circumstances vary from pipelineto pipeline that may require different GICs to be implemented. For example,pipeline will have different sales and transportation markets, customerdemand profiles and gas supply contracts with varying terms and conditions,which need to be considered. Furthermore, the Commission continues to supportstrongly the use of settlement procedures, where appropriate, to fashionpermanent GICs on a case by case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Proposals in a Nutshell</ITAG>The Commission is seeking comments on several methods for a pipeline touse in establishing the two components of the interim gas supply charge.The first method would replace the current pipeline purchased gas adjustment(PGA) mechanism by substituting an interim gas supply charge. The chargewould be a two part charge. One part would be the interim gas inventorycharge. The other part would be the gas commodity charge. The pipelinewould base its interim gas commodity charge for sales service on a competitivemarket price composite (as illustrated in the appendix to this notice)and its gas inventory charge on that composite multiplied by a percentagefactor as derived below. The gas inventory charge is thus a premium, whereappropriate, over the gas commodity charge to compensate the pipeline forcosts related to the merchant function not covered by the gas commoditycharge.Under the second method, the pipeline would continue to use the PGA mechanismas the basis for the interim gas commodity charge for sales service. Thepipeline would be allowed to impose a charge equal to a percentage of itscurrent weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) as its gas inventory charge.The gas inventory charge portion of the interim gas supply charge mechanismwould be applicable only if a firm sales customer's actual purchases fallbelow a percentage of either its monthly or annual nominated purchase amountsas described below. A variant of this method would permit the pipelineto impose a charge in cents per MMBTu (rather than a charge based on apercentage of its WACOG) as its gas inventory charge. As with the firstmethod, the gas inventory charge is a premium over the gas commodity chargeto cover costs associated with the merchant function not covered by thegas commodity charge.The instant gas inventory charge proposals are in no way intended to affectcontractual rights and responsibilities arising under any pipeline's gaspurchase contracts.The Commission believes that the combination of the use of the interimgas supply charge and the reconciliation mechanism fulfills the intentof the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 that market forces play a ``moresignificant role in determining the supply, the demand, and the price ofnatural gas,'' \7\<NOTE/> and the mandate of the Natural Gas Act that a pipeline'srates must be just and reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. State Oil andGas Board of Miss., 474 U.S. 409, 422 (1986).For pipelines using the competitive price method, the Commission's proposedcompetitive price composite, as demonstrated by the appendix,\7\<NOTE/>a represents a true and not a presumed market price. The deficiencycharge method uses both the PGA mechanism and a WACOG measurement for thecost of gas. It is a cost based method. In addition, the Commission hascoupled both pricing mechanisms with the reconciliation mechanism whichforms a cost based price cap on the pipeline's rates. Hence, as an endresult, it can be argued that the pipeline's customers will be ensuredjust and reasonable rates.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\a This appendix is available from the Commission's PublicReference Room.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ FPC v. Texaco, 417 U.S. 380, 397-399 (1974); <T3>Cf. </T3>Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486,1501-1503, 1509-1510, (DC Cir. 1984).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. The First Method: The Competitive Price Concept</ITAG>A. IntroductionAs an interim measure, the Commission is considering, and seeking commentson, use of a composite price of competitive market prices as an appropriatebasis for sales service (the gas commodity charge) and for the interimgas inventory charge if the following four conditions are satisfied: (1)That the competitive market functions properly, in the sense that priceresponds to changes in the demand and supply of gas, (2) that the competitiveprice average used by the pipeline is representative of actual competitiveprices in supply areas from which the pipeline receives its gas, (3) thatsuch competitive price reports are readily available (by subscription orotherwise) to the pipeline, its customers and to the Commission, and (4)that such reports should be published on a regular interval by an entitynot engaged in the business of buying, selling, transporting or brokeringnatural gas. Any source that meets these conditions can be used. The appendixto this notice sets out an illustrative calculation.Such available data on the competitive market may demonstrate that thecompetitive market is currently a well functioning market in the sensethat it is broad (competitive sales, under varying terms and conditions,as a percent of total throughout are variously estimated at between 35and 70 percent), and that it responds to forces of supply and demand (<T3>i.e., </T3>there is a pronounced seasonal effect on competitive prices).The appendix to this notice is the staff's report which discusses the useof competitive market prices as a basis for gas sales service and an interimgas inventory charge.The staff has also examined the behavior of competitive price series publishedin four different trade periodicals and concludes that the series are ingeneral agreement with one another, and that the competitive prices respondto the forces of supply and demand. Thus, competitive prices may serveas an appropriate basis for the gas commodity charge and the gas inventorycharge where the competitive prices exmained are representative of competitiveprices in the supply areas to which they refer.  The gas inventory charge permits the pipeline to pay a premium, where appropriate,in the form of a fixed charge or a higher commodity price for long termsupplies. Indeed, as discussed below, the gas inventory charge is intendedto covere gas supply costs and not to provide additional profit for thepipeline.  <T3>B. Theory  </T3>An interim gas inventory charge may be developed from the perspective ofthe value of gas supply contracts to the pipeline and its customers. Thefocus is on the aggregated value of the pipeline's inventory of contracts. From the pipeline's perspective, entering into gas supply contracts withproducers is a necessary step in the process of offering firm merchantsales service to its customers. Without those contracts the pipeline couldnot provide reliable firm sales service. The benefits associated with thosecontracts are not relized, however, without some obligations and financialrisk to the pipeline. For example, gas supply contracts can be viewed (atleast in an operational sense) as providing something of value to the pipelineand customers demanding merchant service by the pipeline. But the pipelinemay, nonetheless, be exposed to financial risks contained in the contracts.If the pipeline does not perform in accordance with the contracts, thepipeline may be exposed to the incurrence of added costs (<T3>e.g., </T3>take or pay liability claims, contract reformation costs,<T3>etc.</T3>).  For the purposes of quantifying an interim gas inventory charge, an analogycan be drawn before compensation for the ``exposed value'' of net depreciatedfixed assets and compensation for the pipeline's exposure under its inventoryof gas supply contracts. This approach derives the gas inventory chargebased on the value of the pipeline holding an inventory to gas supply contractsfor the benefits of its customers, not on the pipeline customer's ``deficiencyquantities.'' In other words, this approach derives the gas inventory chargeby considering the gas supply insurance for the pipeline's customers dueto the pipeline's inventory of gas supply contracts and the costs to thepipeline of holding and managing that inventory of contracts.  The approximate value of an inventory of gas supply contracts can be establishedfor these purposes based on the expected value for which the pipeline couldsell the gas in the competitive market. Although that price would be expectedto vary over time, depending on competitive conditions, the adoption ofthe competitive price approach in the pipeline's major gas supply areasis reasonable. (See the appendix.)  Periodic changes in the competitive price index reflect market changesin natural gas supply and demand and incorporate the effects of inflation.This approach establishes the gas inventory charge based on an ``instantaneouscharge.'' By using a ``variable'' price index there is no need for anydiscounting (in a ``present value'' context) or for factoring in inflationof future expected prices.  Also, the instantaneous charge does not require any discounting (in a ``presentvalue'' context) of the quantity of gas to be produced at future datesunder individual or aggregated contracts. Rather, this approach assumesthat the pipeline will maintain an inventory of gas supply contracts consistentwith the service demands of, and under the terms and conditions, demandedby its customers. That is, the pipeline would be expected to add new contractsunder varying terms and conditions when and where they are needed and shedother contracts when appropriate.  The net effect is that the pipeline would be expected to maintain an inventoryor portfolio of contracts, providing the aggregate instantaneous deliverability,long-term reserves, if required, with contract provisions consistent withthe merchant service demands of its customers. The mix of physical features(<T3>e.g., </T3>deliverability, rate of production decline, expected depletionperiod, <T3>etc.</T3>) related to the gas supply supporting individual contracts,and the contract parameters (<T3>e.g., </T3>term, price, take requirement, make-up provision, <T3>etc.</T3>) would be expected to satisfy these requirements. Thus, thereis no need to examine the operation of individual contracts.  <T3>C. Quantification  </T3>The essential question is how to best recognize through the pipeline'scurrent rates the value to the pipeline's customers for risks undertakenby the pipeline in assemblying and maintaining an inventory of gas supplycontracts, whether short or long-term, needed to fulfill its merchant function. In the past, the pipeline has been compensated for its take or pay costsby including gas prepayments in the pipeline's rate base and imputing thepipeline's overall pre-tax rate of return allowance to such costs. However,the pipeline foregoes this rate treatment (and any other means of collectingtake or pay costs) when it elects the interim gas supply charge mechanism,which includes the gas inventory charge. Thus the risks attending the inventoryof contracts held by the pipeline are shifted entirely to the pieline. The Commission is considering compensating the pipeline for costs reasonablyassociated with the risk of holding gas supply contracts at the same levelthat the Commission compensates the pipeline for holding its physical assets.That is, assuming the pipeline's approved pre-tax return utilizes the current34 percent Federal tax rate, the proposal would not adjust the pipeline'sapproved pre-tax rate of return for use in developing the interim gas inventorycharge.      The next step in quantifying the interim gas inventory charge developedhere would require an estimation of a reasonable overall take or pay levelto assign to the pipeline's inventory of contracts. On December 16, 1982,the Commission adopted andSection; 2.103 of the Commission's regulationswhich established 75 percent of deliverability as the take level abovewhich no presumption of prudence would attend for <T3>new</T3> contracts.\9\<NOTE/> Prior to this time, new gas supply contracts typically incorporatedconsiderably higher take levels (<T3>e.g.</T3>, 90 percent was not uncommon). In prescribing the 75 percenttake or pay factor, however, the Commission made clear that 75 percentwas the upper limit, and that it was not intended to be a floor. Nothingstated here should in any way be construed as suggesting that the 75 percentfactor is anything other than an upper limit for use in the gas inventorycharge formula described here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Commission has referred to this policy in addressingtake or pay issues in its orders. <T3>See, eg.</T3>, State of Michigan and Michigan Public Service Commissionv. Trunkline Gas Co., 24 FERC andpara; 61,013, at 61,060 (1983) and TennesseeGas Pipeline Co., 26 FERC andpara; 61,102 at 61,247-48, n. 13 (1984). TheCommission does not intend to expand in any way the scope of ``new'' contractscovered by andSection; 2.103.It would not be appropriate to develop the interim gas inventory chargesimply by multiplying the pipeline's pre-tax rate of return by the priceof the gas. That is because the pipeline is not at risk for the full quantityof gas available under its inventory of gas supply contracts. It is onlyat risk for the quantity of gas subject to the take or pay requirement.And, as explained above, there is a ready reference point that recognizesthat the pipeline is not at risk (or certainly it should not be) for thefull quantity of gas supporting the contracts. That factor is the 75 percentdeliverability factor that appears at andSection; 2.103 of the Commission'sregulations.The Commission therefore is considering and is seeking comments on adoptingthe 75 percent factor as a reasonable generic approximation to compensatefor the exposure that the pipeline would have under the operation of takeor pay provisions in its contracts. This level of inferred take requirementshould result in adequate compensation for the risks of exposure to takeor pay and contract reformation costs undertaken by the pipeline or therisk of maintaining long-term supplies in a competitive market. At thesame time, the ``reconciliation mechanism''_which is described below_willprovide adequate protection to the pipeline's customers.In summary, the approach developed here would recognize and account forseveral features. First, it would recognize that the gas supply availableto the pipeline and its customers through the pipeline's inventory of gassupply contracts provides something of value to the pipeline and its customers,<T3>i.e.</T3>, gas supply insurance. This inventory of contracts takeson similarities to and provides the equivalent operational functions (inan operating sense, but not in a financial accounting sense) as thoughthe pipeline itself owned the gas supply supporting the contracts. Thisfeature would be recognized for ratemaking purposes by imputing an economicvalue based upon the pipeline's overall pretax rate of return and the priceat which the gas would be available from time to time to the pipeline'scustomers.Second, the approach recognizes that the pipeline is not at risk for allof the gas supply supporting the inventory of contracts held by the pipeline,but only to the extent of its take or pay and other contract requirements.This feature would be recognized for ratemaking purposes by, effectively,viewing the pipeline's inventory of contracts as one ``umbrella contract''and imputing the generic 75 percent take factor discussed above. The useof this factor would also served as an acknowledgment of the Commission'sgeneral policy against take obligations above the 75 percent threshold,thereby encouraging continued renegotiations of contracts that have notyet been reformed to reflect the realities of the natural gas market.Under the approach outlined here, the overall level of a hypothetical pipeline'sgas inventory charge would be established by the product of the followingthree factors:(1) The monthly average price of competitive purchases, estimated for illustrativeproposes here to be $2.00/MMBtu;(2) An assumed overall pre-tax rate of return of 15 percent for illustrativepurposes; and(3) An inferred overall take requirement of 75 percent under the inventoryof gas supply contracts.Those factors in this illustrative computation would support an interimgas inventory charge level of: $2.00/MMBtux11.25%=22\1/2\andCx.11;/MMBtu.A customer's monthly entitlement times 22\1/2\andCx.11; would equal its totalmonthly gas inventory charge obligation.The interim gas supply charge would thus consist of the gas inventory chargeand the gas commodity charge. Taken together, the charges are intendedto cover the pipeline's total payments to producers such as the cost ofgas it purchases (including any premium paid for long-term contracts inthe form of higher prices), gas inventory charges paid to producers, carryingcharges on prepayments, settlement payments, and contract reformation costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. The Second Method: The Deficiency Charge Method</ITAG>A. IntroductionAlso as an interim measure, the Commission is considering, and seekingcomments on, an interim gas supply charge composed of a pipeline's gascommodity charge based on the current PGA mechanism subject to a cap, plusan interim gas inventory charge (set at, for example, 20% of a pipeline'sWACOG) that would be charged if a firm sales customers actual purchasesfall below, for example, 60% of either its monthly or annual nominatedpurchase amounts. The percentages posed here are illustrative; they wereincluded in a gas inventory charge proposal previously approved by theCommission (Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 44 FERC andpara; 61,413 (1988),<T3>reh'g denied</T3>, 47 FERC andpara; 61,100 (1989)).B. TheoryThe Commission recognizes that if its customers desire it to remain asa merchant, the pipeline is obligated to enter into natural gas purchasecontracts in order to secure sufficient supplies to meet the demands ofits firm sales customers. Here the Commission continues to recognize theuse of the PGA mechanism to establish the gas commodity charge componentof the interim gas supply mechanism.The gas inventory charge component of the mechanism is designed to compensatethe pipeline for the cost of maintaining a ready supply of gas in thoseinstances in which a customer's actual purchases fall significantly belowits nominated purchase amounts.Two aspects of the requirements imposed on a pipeline that wishes to usethe interim gas supply mechanism are essential prerequisites to the Commission'sview that this proposal is in the public interest.First, a pipeline wishing to implement an interim gas inventory chargewill be required to allow its customers to meaningfully nominate new purchaseamounts within their firm service entitlements. Second, in cases when thenomination is less than a customer's firm service entitlement, the pipelinewill be obligated to provide firm transportation at a rate comparable tothe transportation component of the rate charged to its firm sales customers,if the customer desires. Thus, the Commission believes these customersshould not be considered to be totally captive sales customers. This shouldencourage the supplying pipeline to exercise considerable discipline withrespect to its purchasing practices during the pendency of the interimgas supply charge. In any event, it is appropriate for customers to paythe interim gas inventory charge to compensate the pipeline for costs incurredas a result of customers purchasing volumes below their nominated levels.The interim gas inventory charge proposed here (as is the competitive pricecharge) is based upon various proposals made by various pipelines to datefor permanent gas inventory charges. The interim gas inventory charge wouldgo into effect if a firm sales customer's actual purchases fall below apercentage of either its monthly or annual nominated purchase amounts.The proposal is outlined in detail below.C. QuantificationThe Commission proposes to allow the pipeline to use the current PGA mechanismas the basis for the gas commodity charge. The Commission proposes furtherto allow the pipeline to charge 20% of its currently effective WACOG asthe interim gas inventory charge that will be in effect whenever a customer'sactual purchases fall below 60% of either its monthly or annual nominatedpurchase amounts.\10\<NOTE/> The Commission requests comments on both the percentagesproposed here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ As in<T3> Texas Eastern,</T3> the charge would be billed on a monthly basisto each customer purchasing less than its monthly inventory determinant.The sum of a customer's twelve monthly inventory determinant nominationsmust equal at least 60% of the customer's annual contract demand. However,monthly charges could be offset by purchases above monthly inventory determinantsin other months. Thus, if a customer met the 60% level on an annual basis,the pipeline would refund the amounts previously collected from the customer.D.Ceiling On Gas Cost ComponentPrior to the nomination period for the gas inventory charge, the pipelinewill also be required to post a ceiling price or prices for the gas costcomponent of the commodity charge,<T3> i.e.,</T3> current cost of gas plus surcharge adjustment for the periodthe gas inventory charge nominations are in effect. The ceiling pricesshould be based on the pipeline's current PGA rates as adjusted for knownand measurable changes that will occur during the period the gas inventorycharge is in effect. Alternatively, the ceiling could also be revised toreflect changes in the average wellhead cost of gas as measured by referenceto sources outside the control of the pipeline. For example, if the averagewellhead price of gas increased by 10%, the ceiling could be increasedby 10%.The pipeline would not be precluded from filing to increase its price abovethe stated ceiling price. However, if it does so, the pipeline must offerits customers another opportunity to revise their sales nominations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Reconciliation Mechanism</ITAG>As noted above, the interim gas supply charge mechanism, consisting ofa two part rate including the gas commodity cost, plus the interim gasinventory charge, has been based on factors that are known at the timeof its authorization (<T3>e.g.</T3>, pre-tax rate of return, imputed take requirement) and variousgas price mechanisms_which, although not known now, will be based on futureevents (<T3>i.e.</T3>, changes in competitive prices, or WACOG, or PGAs) and willbe known as those future events occur. What the Commission does not know,and is unable to project at this time, is the pipeline's actual level ofgas commodity payments, take or pay payments, contract reformation costs,and other costs related to its merchant function. That is, because we aredealing with a new service, there are no ``base period'' data upon whichprojections of these future merchant-function costs could be made. To addressthis concern and to guard against excessive charges to the pipeline's customers,a ``reconciliation mechanism'' would be adopted.The reconciliation mechanism is straight forward. It would compare thesum totals of actual revenues and actual expenses for the following:(1) The pipeline's revenue collection through (a) its charges for the gasactually sold by it as a merchant under either method and (b) its gas inventorycharge under either method; and(2) The pipeline's actual payments for (a) the gas it purchased and resoldas a merchant, and (b) payments made to suppliers and sought to be recoveredthrough gas inventory charges, including premiums paid to producers, takeor pay buy-out/buy-down settlement payments, contract reformation costs(less any amounts recovered under the litigation exception of its OrderNo. 500 passthrough mechanism), and carrying charges on gas prepayments.Within 90 days following the end of the limited term certificate authorizingthe interim gas supply charge, including the gas inventory charge, thepipeline would file a reconciliation report with the Commission. To theextent that the report includes material that the pipeline believes isconfidential and proprietary (<T3>e.g. </T3>take or pay settlement payments, <T3>etc.</T3>), the pipeline can seek confidential treatment of any suchmaterial consistent with the Commission's regulations. Customers and otheraffected parties will be entitled to comment on the pipeline's report,and any questions concerning the pipeline's purchasing practices couldbe explored at that time.If the pipeline has qualified for a litigation exception to the Order No.500 equitable sharing passthrough mechanism as established in Order No.500-F,\11\<NOTE/> it would have to exclude any costs covered by the litigationexception from the costs to be reflected under the gas inventory chargereconciliation mechanism. Additionally, if the pipeline makes nonjurisdictionalsales or sales under a blanket interruptible sales certificate, it wouldhave to exclude the associated costs and revenues from the gas inventorycharge reconciliation. The pipeline would need to file provisions to reflectthe gas inventory charge reconciliation mechanism in its tariff.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,841.To conclude, the ``reconciliation mechanism'' for the interim gas supplycharge would compare the pipeline's actual gas supply costs for sales servicewith the actual revenues received for the service during the period thatthe interim charge was in effect. Any excess revenues would be returnedto the pipeline's customers in proportion to their nominations or theirdeficiencies (depending on the method used) during the period that theparticular interim gas supply charge was in effect. Interest on any overcollections would be imputed from the end of the period that the interimgas supply charge is in effect at the rate of interest for refunds specifiedin the Commission's regulations. The pipeline would be at risk for anyunder collections of revenue, and the pipeline would not be permitted tofile to recover the costs of any under collections. The Commission believesthese proposed procedures strike an appropriate balance between the needsof the pipeline for funding its merchant function and protection againstany excessive charges to the pipeline's customers during the period thatthe interim gas supply charge would be in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Other Generally Applicable Related Requirements</ITAG>The Commission believes it would be in the public interest to conditionthe certificates to ensure, among other things, that any interim gas supplymechanism would not be anticompetitive or unduly discriminatory. The necessaryconditions would be as follows:A. Term and ApplicabilityThe certificate would be for a period of two years from the date of a pipeline'sacceptance of a certificate. This would provide adequate time for hearingand decision on and implementation of a permanent gas inventory chargeproposal. In addition, this would provide sufficient time for pipelinesto implement the interim gas supply charge mechanism and would providemaximum certainty to the pipeline and its customers. A pipeline must alsohave an application for a permanent gas inventory charge pending beforethe Commission.B. Sales Schedules To Use  The pipeline would use its existing firm sales rate schedules for implementationof the interim gas supply mechanism,12<NOTE/> and would use the interim gas supply mechanism for serviceunder all its firm sales rate schedules.13<NOTE/> This would enable the pipeline's customers to continue serviceunder existing rate schedules during the period of the interim mechanismand avoid disruption in service at the conclusion of the two-year periodif the pipeline's permanent gas inventory charge has not gone into effect. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>12 The pipeline would need to modify its existing rate schedulesto reflect the option service and gas commodity charges. The pipeline alsowould revise its tariff to include the methodology for calculating theoption service and gas commodity charges.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>13 Rate schedules which have a one-part rate would also besubject to the gas inventory charge. If, however, the charge is based onmonthly entitlements, an imputed charge would not be needed.  C. StandbyService  The pipeline would implement a 100 percent standby service under all itsfirm sales rate schedules whereby its firm sales customers may take theirfull daily entitlements as either sales, transportation, or any combinationof sales and transportation. The pipeline's standby charge would be separatelystated in each firm sales rate schedule and would be designed in accordancewith Commission precedent.14<NOTE/> The pipeline's transportation under standby service wouldbe performed under its firm transportation rate schedule. This conditionwould ensure that customers could make their gas purchase decisions basedsolely on the price of gas.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>14 <T3>E.g.,</T3> Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 42 FERC andpara; 61,175 at 61,633.In short, the standby charge must ``recover only those costs which [it]incurs to stand ready to resume sales service should the firm sales customerelect to purchase gas from [the pipeline rather than use its transportationservice].'' <T3>Id.</T3> In addition, the pipeline may recover gathering costs onlyonce from shippers under its standby service. Thus, if a shipper pays forgathering as part of the cost of the pipeline standing ready to sell gas,the shipper should not also pay for gathering as part of its transportationcharges.  <ITAG tagnum="28">In designing such charges, the pipeline's calculations must distinguishbetween sales rate schedules that contain one part rates and those whichcontain two-part rates. Additionally, the pipeline must agree to waivethe firm transportation reservation charge when customers use the standbyservice to transport gas, in order to prevent a double collection of costs.For a further detailed discussion </ITAG><T3>see</T3> El Paso Natural Gas Company, 35 FERC andpara; 61,440 at 62,070(1985). D. Nominations  The pipeline would permit its firm sales customers to freely nominate bothmonthly and annual requirements, provided that a customer's total of monthlyentitlements cannot exceed its nominated annual entitlement. Any customerwhich nominates monthly and annual entitlements below its full currentcontract demand level during the period of this gas inventory charge wouldbe considered to have consented to abandonment of the amount not nominated(subject to revival if the pipeline does not have a permanent gas inventorycharge in place upon termination of its limited gas inventory charge).15<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>15 <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 2.105 (1988).  E. Conversions  The pipeline would permit its firm sales customers to convert up to 100percent of firm entitlements to firm transportation service. This provisionand the one above concerning nominations would enable the pipeline to tailorits gas supply to meet customer nominations without guessing what supplymay be needed or shed in the future.  F. Purchased Gas Adjustment Clause  The pipeline using method one, the competitive price method, would terminatethe operation of its PGA clause for the period of its limited term certificateand would be entitled to direct bill its Account No. 191 balance. Thiswill more closely match cost responsibility with cost incurrence and removefuture uncertainty for pipelines and their customers as to the dispositionof the monies in that account. The pipeline could only reinstate its PGAby complying with andSection; 154.303(b) of the regulations or by establishingits right to a waiver therefrom. The Commission at the end of the limitedterm certificate will waive the three year rule to permit the pipelineto reinstate its PGA.  The pipeline would propose a plan for direct billing which would permitits customers to pay the direct bill either in installments or in a lumpsum. Customers would be allowed to challenge the prudence of the directbilling amounts. In addition, the pipeline would make any applicable refundsto its customers.  As with the PGA process, the parties will have the opportunity to challengethe pipeline's expenditures and purchasing practices on grounds of prudence,fraud and abuse, and the affiliated entities test on a general and individualcontract basis.  The interim gas supply charges and the interim gas inventory charges proposedhere are primarily designed for pipelines that purchase exclusively oralmost exclusively from producers.16<NOTE/> The Commission anticipates that those pipelines that purchaseprimarily from other pipelines will continue to maintain their PGA mechanismsand flow through the gas inventory charges in their rates on an as-billedbasis.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>16 Those pipelines that purchase a small percentage of theirsupply from other pipelines may need to make minor modifications to theproposals to reflect the demand charges or GICs of their suppliers.  The Commission recognizes that there are some pipelines that do not fallinto either category, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the pipeline purchases significant supplies from both otherpipelines and producers. These pipelines should propose a method for handlingthese two types of purchases in their certificate applications.  G. Open Access  The pipeline must remain an open access transporter under Part 284, SubpartG of the Commission's regulations for the term of the interim certificate. H. Storage  The pipeline would be required to remove any restrictions on its customer'sability to inject gas purchased from others into contract storage.  I. Receipt Points  The pipeline would be required to permit flexible receipt points in itsfirm transportation contracts.  J. Take or Pay Costs  The pipeline would not recover future take or pay or similar charges fromcustomers by any means other than the gas inventory charge except thosecosts which it is allowed to recover under the litigation exception. Thepipeline would be required to demonstrate that it would not recover thesame take or pay costs under which its gas inventory charge and its OrderNo. 500 charges. The pipeline would be required to delete tariff referencesto take or pay crediting and would not be entitled to require informationwith respect to take or pay crediting in customer requests for transportationor in contracts.  K. Judicial Review  In addition, a pipeline's acceptance of a limited term certificate wouldconstitute a waiver of its right to seek judicial review of each and everyaspect of the order issuing the certificate. The Commission believes thatthis is appropriate because the pipeline's acceptance of a certificatewould be voluntary. It may reject the certificate and retain its currentsales service pricing procedures and pursue its own gas inventory chargeproposal. It would be inappropriate if the pipeline could accept the limitedterm certificate, which is a package, and litigate its individual components. L. Future Rate Filing  The Commission would also require the pipeline to make a full Section 4rate filing under andSection; 154.63 of the Commission's regulations within90 days of its acceptance of the certificate if it does not have a currentrate case pending or rates which were established based on a base periodending within 12 months from the date a certificate would go into effect.This is necessary because such items as the pipeline's rate of return maybe out of date and its allocation of costs and levels of service may notbe synchronized.17<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>17 The pipeline will be at risk for any undercollections ofnon-gas costs during the period between the effectiveness of its revisedsales rates and the effective date of the new sales rates.  M. CompetitivePrice Filings  The pipeline using method one, the competitive price method, would be requiredto file with the Commission, on a quarterly basis, tariff sheets reflectingthe competitive price utilized for purposes of computing the commoditysales rates and the interim gas inventory charge.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Additional Questions on Which Comments Are Sought  </ITAG>The Commission is particularly interested in receiving comments on thefollowing issues:  (1) The proposed policy statement details two possible methods for developingan interim gas supply charge and an interim limited term gas inventorycharge. The Commission is interested in receiving comments on the two proposalsoutlined herein, as well as on any other proposal for implementation onan interim basis.  (2) The purpose of providing a mechanism for an interim gas supply charge,and an interim gas inventory charge, is to provide a means to compensatepipelines for securing long-term natural gas supplies for firm sales customersand, in particular, to prevent a reoccurrence of the take or pay problemsof the past. Would implementation of either of the methods proposed herein,if coupled with implementation of a permanent gas supply charge and a permanentgas inventory charge, accomplish those objectives?  (3) What effect would implementation of either method have on a pipeline'sability to market gas and on the purchasing practices of LDCs?(4) The competitive pricing method for the interim gas supply charge uses75 percent as an estimation of a reasonable overall take or pay level toassign to the pipeline's inventory of contracts. The rationale for doingso is outlined herein. Parties should address whether that level is appropriate.Commenters suggesting another level should specify their reasons for doingso.  (5) The competitive pricing method for the interim gas supply charge tiesboth the gas commodity price and the gas inventory charge to competitiveprices. Would doing so have a positive or negative effect on long-termgas prices from both a producer's and a consumer's point of view? Further,would doing so have a positive or negative effect on long-term gas supplies? (6) Would implementation of an interim gas inventory charge based on eithera competitive price concept or a deficiency charge method affect the rightsand responsibilities of parties under existing gas purchase contracts,if so, how?  (7) The deficiency charge method for the interim gas inventory charge hasbeen illustrated with a chrage equal to 20 percent of the pipeline's WACOGapplicable only if a firm sales customer's actual purchases fall below60 percent of its nominated purchase amounts. The illustration percentagesare based on a gas inventory charge proposal approved by the Commission.18<NOTE/> Parties should address whether the 20 percent and 60 percentlevels are appropriate. Commenters suggesting other levels should specifytheir reasons for doing so.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>18 Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 44 FERC andpara; 61,413(1988), <T3>reh'q denied</T3>, 47 FERC andpara; 61,100 (1989).  (8) As proposed, the deficiency charge would be based on a flat percentageof a pipeline's current WACOG. Does this type of charge provide a disincentivefor pipelines to keep their costs of purchased gas down? Does the deficiencycharge method need to have a cap on the WACOG and, if so, how should thecap be determined? Finally, should the WACOG used in developing a deficiencycharge be calculated on a weighted average basis for all interstate pipelines? (9) Does the proposed reconciliation method adequately protect a pipeline'scustomers from excessive charges as a result of the interim gas supplycharge and interim gas inventory charge? Does it provide an adequate incentiveto pipelines to hold down costs, enter into long-term contracts if appropriate,or otherwise file for an interim gas inventory charge?  (10) Do the proposed conditions regarding nominations and conversions providesufficient flexibility for existing firm sales customers to make a realisticassessment of their current needs in light of current market circumstances? (11) Should the Commission consider additional voluntary rights for customers,including conversions of service obligations to interruptible transportation,abandonment or scheduled abandonment of service obligations, or combinationsof the foregoing to meet the new market environment?  (12) What is the likely competitive effect of the two interim gas inventorycharges discussed above on segments of the industry which would not bedirectly subject to the charge, such as marketers and industrial users? (13) What is the likely competitive effect of the demand based and deficiencybased gas inventory charges on the competitive nature of gas markets? (14) Will either proposed gas inventory charge give any particular segmentof the industry a competitive advantage or disadvantage?  (15) Should the Commission limit or prohibit extensions of an interim gasinventory charge in order to provide incentives for pipelines and theircustomers to put permanent gas inventory charges into place by the endof the two-year period?  (16) On alternative to the two methods proposed in this Notice would beto allow any pipeline to file tariffs immediately, pursuant to section4 of the Natural Gas Act, to implement an interim GIC of 35 cents per MMBtu,for deficiencies below 80 percent of the volumes nominated, subject torefund. The amounts paid would be added to the PGA. The case would go tohearing on an expedited basis to determine the just and reasonable ratefor a permanent GIC. Would this method work? Would it be preferable tothe other two methods? Would consumers be protected under this proposal? <ITAG tagnum="84">IX.
