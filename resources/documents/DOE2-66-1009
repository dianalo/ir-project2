The parameters for the derived kineticequations help identify a first improvement in terms of 1,2 dichloroethaneyield attainable in both once-through and recycle reactors. Fluodynamicbehavior was correlated with an HCl/ethylene feed ratio through an equilibriumbetween different forms of active copper on catalysts. Higher valuesof this ratio allow further improvement of EDC yield up to 96.8% molarvalues, 2 to 3 percentage points higher than those attainable heretofore.</TEXT></DOC>
