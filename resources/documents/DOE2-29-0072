We show that h/sub c2/(O) is then independentof A and that it increases steadily as the Einstein frequency Omega/subE/ of the delta function is lowered. We argue that there is a local maximumin h/sub c2/(O) at Omega/sub E/=O. The value at maximum is very sensitiveto impurity content and increases sharply from a clean-limit value of1.5 at T/sub c//Omega/sub E/ = 1.33 to more than 3.45 in the dirty limit.</TEXT></DOC>
