Among alternatives to the WPP bid, JWT directors also are considering seeking a friendly merger partner, taking JWT private in a leveraged buyout or repurchasing JWT shares, sources said.    Among other possible suitors are MCA Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc., which told JWT directors Tuesday that they may be interested in discussing a friendly joint offer for the company. JWT sources have said directors also were told a second, unidentified suitor had contacted Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., JWT's investment banker, about a possible friendly takeover of JWT.    Sources close to JWT said Morgan Stanley has scheduled meetings over the weekend on the possible takeover of JWT.    However, in a staff memo yesterday, Don Johnston, JWT's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company is &quot;not now in merger negotiations with anyone.&quot; He said JWT is reviewing &quot;all possibilities,&quot; including WPP's bid.    London-based WPP, a marketing service concern, already controls a 5% stake in JWT.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, JWT shares closed at $52.50, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
