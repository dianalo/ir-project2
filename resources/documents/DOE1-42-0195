Coal gasification and liquefaction:4 groups of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and others. 4. Solar system: about 200companies 5. Solar power generation: about 30 companies 6. Geothermalenergy: about 60 companies. Many companies work also for other energy.II. Emphasis is placed on the following points in new energy development.1. Development of coal resources and direct use of coal 2. Coal gasification3. Solar power generation III. The following are subjects on the developmentof new energy. Technical development at low cost, understanding of thefuture needs for technology and equipment, and accumulation of developedtechniques and know-how. (60 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
