Petrillo, a partner in the Washington law firm of Petrillo andHordell, said GAO rules generally allow a protest to continue if it was filedwithin 10 days of the date on which a company receives &quot;the information thatis the basis of the complaint.andP;  Some of these things are not cut and dried,though,&quot; he said.andM;Honeywell's director of contract management, Art Goodell, said Honeywellconsiders the protest unfounded.andM;Air force officials also are concerned that the protest could delay the WISupgrade.andM;&quot;There isn't any question that there is already some danger of certainaspects of the program slipping an unspecified amount of time,&quot; said BenErdman, the Joint Data System Support Center's director for WWMCCS ADP.andM;Honeywell had planned to deliver between 10,000 and 80,000 computers,peripherals and software under the contract.andM;The protest is the latest in a series of problems for the program.andP;  Spiralingcosts led Defense Department officials to place the program under the AirForce chief of staff in 1982.andP;  This year, the program was switched to theDefense Communications Agency.andP;  A DCA source said the transfer was made toprevent &quot;excessive parochialism&quot; among the services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
