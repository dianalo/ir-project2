Haig Jr., a former U.S. secretary ofstate, said Wednesday the West must not drive China into isolation,and recommended that a freeze on new credit be lifted.   Haig, the most prominent American to visit China since the armycrackdown on pro-democracy protests June 3-4, said meetings withChinese leaders reassured him China is serious about keeping itsdoors open to the world.   ``Regardless of your point of view,'' Haig said in an interviewshortly before his departure, ``we simply must continue tocommunicate with Chinese leaders.''   While in Beijing for a business symposium, Haig met with PremierLi Peng, President Yang Shangkun and Jiang Zemin, the new CommunistParty chief. He spoke briefly with senior leader Deng Xiaoping onthe rostrum of Tiananmen Gate.   Haig, who heads a private consulting firm, said the ``overridingimperative'' of Western governments now ``is to avoid driving Chinainto resentful and angry isolation.''   He praised President Bush for showing ``restraint on excessiveoverreaction'' but said the time had come to reconsider the policy,backed by most Western countries and Japan, of freezing action onnew credit by such international lending institutes as the WorldBank.   Withholding of new loans ``could affect the people of China,''he said, and ``I don't think that should be restrained too muchlonger.''   Most Western nations have halted high-level official contactsand suspended arms sales, as well as cutting off new credit, toshow their outrage over the Chinese government's violentsuppression of dissent.   The former secretary of state said the message to China shouldbe: ``We were mad, we reacted, but we've got to go on.''   Haig said Chinese-American contacts, resumed 18 years ago, havebeen ``fundamentally advantageous'' to world peace and regionalstability.   U.S. businesses must assess the risks of investing in China,which in addition to political turmoil is undergoing an economicausterity program to combat excessive growth and serious gapsbetween supply and demand, Haig said.   He added, referring to businesses already here: ``I would notadvise them to pick up stakes and pull out. ... I still thinkthere's a lot of good business to be done in China.''   Noting that 20-25 percent of China's gross national product isdirectly related to international commerce, Haig said: ``Even ifthere were an intention to reverse that, it could not be donewithout serious repercussions, which I don't think any leadershipin China would risk.''   China blames the United States for the current strain inrelations, contending that a nation's relations with others shouldnot be affected by its domestic policies.</TEXT></DOC>
