The rightist victory in legislative and municipal electionsMarch 20 sets the stage for the escalation of leftist guerrillaconflict in this country already ravaged by eight years of civilwar.   The nature of pre-election violence, which included car bombsand club-wielding masked youths rampaging through the capital,augured badly for those who had hoped that six years of civilianrule by the Christian Democrats would promote moderation in thesearch for solutions to El Salvador's problems.   No country in the hemisphere gets more U.S. assistance than ElSalvador, which President Reagan has held up as an example ofsuccess in Washington's avowed policy of fostering democracy inLatin America.   This Massachusetts-sized country of 5 million people receivedabout $550 million in U.S. military and economic aid last year.U.S. assistance has totaled $3.5 billion since 1981.   A rightist party, linked in the early 1980s to death squadsresponsible for thousands of political murders, won a landslidevictory in the municipal and legislative elections.   ``Liberty is written with blood. ... El Salvador is the tombwhere the Reds will meet their end,'' goes the party anthem of theRepublican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.   The party captured a majority in the 60-seat National Assemblyand most of the country's municipalities.   Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a retired army colonel and one of theparty's ideologues, Wednesday called for a crackdown on leftistsactive outside guerrilla ranks.   In the 10 days before the vote, left-wing university groups andlabor organizations staged several anti-government marches in thecapital. The marchers, their faces covered with bandannas andcarrying two-by-fours studded with nails, commandeered buses toblock side streets, burned telephone exchange boxes and set fire toseveral vehicles.   Police exercised restraint, resorting only once to tear gas todisperse the demonstrators.   ``We cannot allow this to continue, the destruction of stateproperty, private property,'' Ochoa said on a morning TV newsprogram. ``We have to impose law and order.''   For their part, Marxist guerrillas waging the stalemated waragainst the centrist Christian Democratic government plan tobroaden their campaign, according to rebel documents captured bygovernment forces.   The documents outline a plan the guerrillas call ``Fire.'' Itcalls for formation and indoctrination of ``mass organizations'' _mostly among students and labor union people _ ``to deepen thecrisis.''   Its authors, reportedly members of the guerrilla GeneralCommand, said the government's options _ to increase repression orcontinue allowing the demonstrators to act with relative impunity _both favored the revolution.   ``If they crack down on a big scale the insurrection willincrease in response to the repression, and if they do not,insurrection will advance as a result of the crisis and hunger,''it says.   It says if ``Fire'' succeeds in forging a mass front, 1988provides circumstances propitious for ``the seizure of power.''   Guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos predicted last Tuesdaythat as a result of the election, ``the country will becomeungovernable.''   Speaking on Radio Vencermos, the rebels' clandestine station, hesaid the rightist victory favored the rebels by giving the people``a clear choice.''   Alfredo Cristiani, president of Arena, told The Associated Presshis party would try to hammer out with other parties in theassembly a peace proposal to submit to the guerrillas.   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal, which will bethe result of a national consensus, they do not leave any other wayout but a military solution,'' he said. He indicated that wouldmean stepped-up combat.   Ruben Zamora, vice-president of the Democratic RevolutionaryFront, told the AP Wednesday he did not believe the vote indicatedthe electorate's shift to the right. The Revolutionary Front isallied with the guerrillas and declined to take part in theelections.   ``What happened was that the electorate punished the ChristianDemocrats for all the promises they did not fulfill,'' he said.   President Jose Napoleon Duarte was elected in 1984 on a platformof ending the war and improving the average family's lot. The warcontinues, unemployment is about 40 percent and inflation isrunning at about 40 percent annually.   The victory improves Arena's prospects in presidential electionsset for next March.   Adolfo Rey Prendes, the front-runner for the ChristianDemocratic presidential nomination, told reporters: ``If Arenatakes power, other parties' possibilities will be diminished. Thedemocratic process will be restricted.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Douglas Grant Mine, formerly news editor inArgentina, now covers Central America for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
