(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 10{-foot alligator lunged from aresidential lake, seized a 4-year-old girl who was wading with herbrother and a friend and dragged her to her death.   Game officers spotted the alligator on the bank of Hidden Lakearound midnight carrying the limp body of Erin Glover in its jaws.The reptile was immediately shot to death with a .357-caliber Magnumpistol, said Stephen Condit, Red Cross disaster services director.   The girl's body was recovered, he said.   Since 1948, there have been 95 unprovoked alligator attacks inFlorida, with five previous deaths, said game commission Lt. JimFarrior.   ``An autopsy of the alligator was performed on the scene anddetermined it to be the (alligator that killed her),'' CharlotteCounty dispatcher John Kefer said Sunday. He did not know whataspect of the autopsy identified the reptile as the killer.   Erin was walking along the lake's south shore with her brotherJustin, 8, their dog, and neighbor Jason Kershanick, 9, at 6:30 p.m.Saturday when the gator bolted from the water and snapped up thegirl in its teeth.   Jason said Sunday that the children were walking in ankle-deepwater.   ``The little girl was throwing rocks and kicking the water. Whileshe was kicking, she must have kicked the alligator. Right when shestopped kicking, the alligator jumped up out of the water andstarted biting her two times in the stomach,'' Jason said. ``Then hedropped her and she crawled away, and then he got out of the watermore and grabbed her from the back and went in the water.''   ``After it happened, then we ran,'' he added. ``It was prettyquick. It seemed like a nightmare, a dream. But then the way shescreamed, when I saw the blood after he went in, then I realized itwas real.''   Alligators tend to pull their prey underwater, drowning them andstashing the body for later feeding.   Wayne Kershanick went to the lake with a pistol after his sonalerted him.   ``I saw it taking her off to the other side'' of the lake,Kershanik said. ``I tried to track it through the weeds, but by thetime I got there he went under with her, and that was the last Iseen of him.''   Neighbor Nolan Jesse said he had heard Erin's mother screamingand took a rifle to the lake. He said he saw a large alligatorsurface with a light-colored object in its mouth.   ``It was within rifle range but I was afraid to shoot because ofthe object,'' Jesse said.   The gator was spotted after five divers had searched the lake andweeds surrounded by the Gardens of Gulf Cove development while sixFlorida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission officers and severaldeputies and emergency workers walked the land. The area is about 25miles south of Sarasota on Florida's west coast.   ``It was a shock. It will be a while getting over it,'' Erin'sstepfather, Ty Bowns, said outside the family's house.   ``All the kids around here played around all these lakes. I don'tthink anybody took the alligators all that seriously.''   Justin was staying with neighbors after the incident.   Kershanick's wife, Charlotte, said nothing had been done aboutpast alligator complaints.   ``A lot of them are aggravated because they've complained aboutthe alligators being here, but nobody does anything,'' she said.``They ought to have the ponds fenced in.''   Alligators once were vigorously hunted and their populationdwindled in Florida. They were made a protected species in themid-1960s.   But in the past few years, it has become clear that the speciesis in no danger of extinction, said Farrior.   State wildlife experts estimate there are 1 million alligators on6.7 million acres of land.   On Sept. 1, for the first time since 1962, the state will hold aone-month gator hunt in which no more than 3,000 are to be taken.   ``They occupy pretty much any body of water that would look likean alligator lives there, and lots that don't,'' Farrior said.   Last year, 3,853 gators were killed because they were declared anuisance, threatening children and livestock.   The attack on Erin was the third gator attack on the Gulf Coastin the past six months. Both previous victims survived the attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
