A Gerber spokesman declined to say for how much the unit, CWT Inc., might be sold. He said, however, that the company would take &quot;some write-off&quot; as a result of the proposed sale.    The baby-food maker, which also is in the apparel, transportation and furniture businesses, recently said that the company's trucking operations weren't part of its long-term growth plans. Gerber said that as a result, CWT management requested an opportunity to pursue a possible purchase option for the unit.    In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company with debt that's finally paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    CWT has about $135 million, or about 14%, of Gerber's total annual revenue. </TEXT></DOC>
