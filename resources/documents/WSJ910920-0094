If you don't remember the 1980 recession, don't beembarrassed. Scarcely anyone else does either. A lot ofeconomic water has gone under the bridge since then, notleast a decade of economic growth that expanded the economyby a third in real terms. And anyway, the 1980 recession wasa brief affair, lasting from economic peak in January 1980 toa trough in July, the shortest recession on record. Andtherein lies the tale.</LP><TEXT>   For the 1980 recession was the credit-control recession.Coming into a presidential re-election campaign withinflation steaming, and having broken its pick on &quot;voluntarywage-price guidelines,&quot; the Carter administration discoveredthe never-invoked powers of the Credit Control Act of 1969,which said the President could direct the Federal Reserve to&quot;regulate or control any or all extensions of credit.&quot; As hisanti-inflation program, President Carter browbeat a reluctantFed into announcing credit controls, which were actuallyspecial reserve requirements on loans for &quot;bad&quot; purposes asopposed to &quot;good&quot; purposes.   Waiting for the Fed to sort out the good purposes and thebad purposes, the banks stopped lending for any purpose. Theeconomy promptly collapsed. It had already been a littlepeaked when the controls were enacted in March. Congressdidn't help matters when the same month it enacted a&quot;windfall-profits tax&quot; on oil production in the name ofsolving the late and unlamented &quot;energy crisis.&quot; Beneaththese blows, the economy plunged in April. Unemploymentsoared by 800,000.   The Fed quickly started pleading with the banks to beginmaking loans again. Chairman Paul Volcker put out a statementsaying that the program wasn't intended to constrain lendingfor farmers, small-business men, home builders or businessesexpanding production capacity. By July, the Fed officiallyabolished the controls; President Carter put out a statementbragging about how well they had worked. With theseannouncements, the economy promptly recovered. The recessionwas over. The next December, Congress repealed the CreditControl Act.   The difference this time around is that we no longerbother with laws. Congress learned to short-cut suchformalities in episodes like the Iran-Contra hearings and theBork lynching. Now it beats up on bank examiners directly,blaming them for bad loans created by Congress's fecklessnesson macroeconomic policy and Congress's previous pressure onexaminers to go easy on Don Dixon, Charley Keating and otherpeople who made big political contributions. In 1980, youcould abolish the controls. Today you can't put out astatement calling off the climate of intimidation; indeed itcontinues with the blast at Comptroller of the CurrencyRobert Clarke by Congress's pit bull, the General AccountingOffice. So we have to hope for a lingering convalescence.   There is a further danger here. The 1980 recession costChairman Volcker a year in his anti-inflation fight. Thecredit controls inevitably depressed the monetary aggregates;M1 and the rest can't grow unless the banks make loans withthe reserves that the Fed supplies. In 1980, the Fed wasofficially following the aggregates, and as they fell itpumped out more reserves. When the controls were lifted, themoney numbers soared. Then the Fed had to clamp back down andcause a not-so-short-and-deep recession from July 1981 toNovember 1982, when the much-delayed Reagan tax cuts wereabout to go into full effect.   There is no small danger that we are about to do thisagain too. We are starting to hear altogether too much talkabout M2; if you can remember how to look up such arcanelore, it turns out to be pretty flat. This is because banksaren't making loans. They have plenty of reserves; themonetary base was up 7.8% from a year earlier as of September4. In technical jargon, there has been a drop in the demandfor money; it is a mistake to try to offset this by boostingthe supply of money.   Now, we do believe the latest Fed easing was appropriate,since as a monetary guidepost we follow the price ofsensitive commodities. As a rough guide, experience suggeststhat a gold price below $350 is a sign of overly tightpolicy. With the price essentially at this barrier, the Fedeased. Our conclusion is that the Fed is doing just fine;leave it alone.   The cure for the lingering recession lies elsewhere. Weneed to let the bank examiners use professional judgmentwithout Congress tipping the scales first one way and thenthe other. We need some sign in tax policy that we haven'tembarked on a new era of constantly escalating levies. And tothese ends we need some signs of leadership from the Bushadministration.</TEXT></DOC>
