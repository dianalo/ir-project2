Japan, which took a heavy economic gamble to do so, saidlate Sunday it would ban all oil imports from Iraq andIraqi-occupied Kuwait, halt all exports to the two states andfreeze economic aid to Baghdad. Not only does Japan import12% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait, but it also has 700billion yen ($4.67 billion) in loans outstanding to Baghdad,which are now at risk.</LP><TEXT>   And in what is being called the strongest punitive actionever taken by the European Community, the 12-nation blocagreed Saturday to impose a series of tough sanctions aimedat &quot;the heart&quot; of Iraqi economic and military interests. Thesanctions include an oil embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, a halton military sales to Iraq and suspension of cooperation withIraq in military, technical and scientific fields.   The strength of the EC measures and the unanimity were inmarked contrast to past crises, when the EC members have beendivided over whether to impose sanctions and how strong theyshould be. During the U.S.-hostage taking in Iran, forexample, trade sanctions imposed by the EC fell short of U.S.expectations. There have also been differences among themember nations on policy toward Libya.   The EC imports 10.9% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait, andan oil embargo could hurt some EC members such as Denmark,which depends on Iraq and Kuwait for more than half of itsoil.   The EC members said they were also prepared to support andenforce United Nations sanctions against Iraq if Baghdadfailed to heed calls for the immediate and unconditionalwithdrawal of its troops from Kuwait. (Members of the U.N.Security Council met informally yesterday, and the U.S. urgedthe imposition of broad economic and military sanctions onIraq. Diplomats expect the measures to be adopted, perhaps asearly as today.)   &quot;We will not be satisfied until there is not a singleIraqi soldier in Kuwait and until there is a legitimate andsovereign government in Kuwait,&quot; Italian Foreign Ministryspokesman Giovanni Castellaneta said.   In a speech yesterday in Aspen, Colo., British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Iraqi invasion andcalled for a &quot;total economic embargo&quot; against Iraq unless itwithdraws from Kuwait &quot;without delay.&quot; She added: &quot;The U.S.and Europe both support this. But to be totally effective itwill need the support of all U.N. members. They must stand upand be counted because a vital principle is at stake: Anaggressor must never be allowed to get his way.&quot; Mrs.Thatcher is expected to meet with President Bush inWashington today.   In opting to impose an oil embargo, Japan departed fromits usual oil-first policy. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifuoverrode the opposition of the powerful Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry, which feared a long-termimpact on Japan's economy. In 1979, Tokyo refused to followsuit when the U.S. and Western Europe imposed an oil embargoon Iran after Tehran took Americans hostage at the U.S.Embassy.   &quot;It is the very first time for Japan to take such adrastic move before the U.N. has decided anything onsanctions,&quot; a Foreign Ministry official who requestedanonymity told Japan's Kyodo news service.   This time, the decision was clearly in favor ofinternational solidarity. &quot;Japan will face hardships due tothe ban on oil imports, but this is a bold start ininternational cooperation,&quot; said Deputy Chief CabinetSecretary Nobuo Ishihara. Although Japan imports 99% of itsoil, it has almost five months' supply in reserve against anyoil cutoff.   The new Iraqi-installed government in Kuwait, meanwhile,has warned countries with nationals in Kuwait not to takesanctions against it or Iraq. Well over one millionforeigners work in Kuwait, among them thousands of Westernersand Japanese with senior positions in banks and the oilindustry, and a substantial group of Western militaryadvisers.   &quot;These countries should also not expect us to acthonorably at a time when they are conspiring against us andother brothers in Iraq in an aggressive way,&quot; Iraqi-imposedForeign Minister Walid Saud Muammad Abdullah said on Iraqiradio.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, meanwhile, discussed the invasion bytelephone Saturday, Soviet news media reported. Theyexchanged views, assessed the situation as serious and agreedto continue contacts, according to the Tass news agency andRadio Moscow.   Mr. Mitterrand discussed a punitive blockade of Iraq withkey cabinet members on Saturday, Foreign Minister RolandDumas said. Mr. Dumas said a blockade and military actionwere considered in response to the invasion. A blockade &quot;wasexamined with all the country's service heads, notably themilitary,&quot; Mr. Dumas said in answer to a reporter's question.He didn't specify if this referred to a naval blockade, andsaid a blockade was a measure that had to be taken in concertwith all major powers.   In an apparent rebuff to Iraqi efforts to stop at leastpart of the embargo, Turkish President Turgut Ozal yesterdaydeclined to guarantee that Iraq's vital trans-Turkey pipelinewill be safe from international economic sanctions, accordingto a Turkish individual close to the talks. Iraq sent a topofficial to Ankara yesterday to confer with Mr. Ozal, but&quot;President Ozal was noncommittal about the pipeline,&quot; theindividual said.   More than half of Iraq's oil exports are pumped throughthe pipeline from the Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterraneancoast. On leaving Ankara, the Iraqi official appealed toTurkey to &quot;take their joint interests into account&quot; and notto create an &quot;atmosphere of distrust&quot; by cutting the vitalartery. Iraq earns almost all of its foreign exchange fromoil.   Foreign diplomats think it unlikely that Turkey will closethe pipeline but note a hardening of the Turkish position onthe Iraq-Kuwait crisis, despite its important ties withBaghdad. In public statements, Turkey has called only for theimplementation of the U.N. resolution calling for Iraq'swithdrawal. But Mr. Ozal's spokesman said the Turkishpresident had demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops fromKuwait and the restoration of the deposed Emir of Kuwait.   President Bush has called Mr. Ozal twice so far to discussthe crisis and Mr. Ozal has been conducting intense telephonediplomacy in the region, but Turkish and U.S. officials saythere has been no direct U.S. pressure on Turkey to cut thepipeline.   Meanwhile, the prospect of higher oil prices is unravelingthe silver lining in Britain's bleak economy and furtherclouding the already faltering United Kingdom stock market.Inflation, which was expected to be capped at around 10.5%this month, now is expected to keep rising. And any cut inBritain's 15% base interest rate probably won't come untilearly 1991 instead of occurring later this year, analysts andeconomists predict.   Until last week, many U.K. fund managers and other marketexperts were predicting a lagging stock market through yearend, followed by a sharp recovery spurred by expectedinterest rate cuts.   But that timetable now may have to be revised. The marketimpact of the gulf crisis is likely to be adverse, sharp andbroadly based, analysts say. With the obvious exception ofdefense and oil stocks, shares of industrial andconsumer-oriented companies -- many of which were alreadyreeling before last week -- are expected to come undergreater pressure.   The West Germans have special reason to worry aboutanother oil crisis. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has pledged not toboost taxes to pay for his unification plan. This means thatBonn is borrowing money on international credit markets andwould feel the direct impact of higher interest ratesprompted by a global economic downturn.   But West German officials insist that the country iswell-positioned to deal with whatever comes out of thecurrent crisis. They point out that West Germany's strongeconomy and large trade surplus give them at least a partialbuffer against events beyond their control.   The 12 EC nations didn't cut diplomatic relations orwithdraw their ambassadors from Iraq because that would makeit impractical to defend their citizens in the area. In awritten statement, the EC countries described as &quot;groundlessand unacceptable&quot; Iraq's justification for the militaryaction. They said they would do everything they could toavoid an implicit recognition of the so-called provisionalgovernment installed in Kuwait.   The Soviet Union, following the invasion, demanded thatIraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait, and it cut off armssupplies to Baghdad. Soviet officials and the state-run presshave unanimously condemned the action. Straight news reportson the invasion have dominated newspapers, television andradio. Saturday, several papers described Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein as a dictator and a liar and said the invasionwas a crime.   Such coverage marks a radical reversal of decades ofsilence during which Soviet officials and journalistswouldn't criticize any close ally. The Soviet Union has beenIraq's main source of weapons for 30 years and has afriendship and cooperation treaty with Baghdad.   Indeed, the attack has provoked unprecedented cooperationbetween the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which issued a jointappeal for a world ban on arms shipments to Iraq. That hadled to speculation that China, believed to be thethird-largest supplier of arms to Iraq after the Soviet Unionand France, would fill the breach as Paris and Moscow stemmedthe flow of their arms to Baghdad.   But Sunday, China announced after two days of talks with aspecial U.S. envoy that it wouldn't sell weapons to Iraq.   Senior Chinese officials wouldn't, however, committhemselves to supporting wider economic sanctions againstBaghdad.   ---         Countries That Have Announced Sanctions                                                                                                                      Arms Sales Suspended                                                                                                        -- Poland -- Czechoslovakia -- China -- Italy -- Soviet Union -- France (sales already suspended because of unpaid debts)                                                                                                                    Kuwait and/or Iraqi Assets Frozen                                                                                                        -- Norway -- United States -- Denmark -- France -- Italy -- The Netherlands -- Spain -- West Germany -- Ireland -- Greece -- Portugal -- Japan -- Belgium* -- Luxembourg* -- Switzerland* (*Recommended)                                                                                                                              Oil Imports Banned                                                                                                        -- Japan -- United States -- Belgium -- Denmark -- Britain -- France -- Italy -- West Germany -- Ireland -- Luxembourg -- The Netherlands -- Portugal -- Spain -- Greece</TEXT></DOC>
