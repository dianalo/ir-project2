Three Fed members, Martha Seger, Wayne Angell and Edward Kelley, unsuccessfully argued that monetary policy should remain unchanged.    But, as previously reported, the three dissenters on Aug. 9 joined other Fed members in voting to raise the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges for loans to banks, to 6.5% from 6%. The move was viewed as a clear indication of the Fed's determination to fight inflation by slowing the economy. Other short-term interest rates rose after the discount-rate increase.    The minutes of the June 29-30 Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released Friday after the customary lag of about six weeks. The committee, which includes all members of the Fed and the presidents of five regional Fed banks, met again last week. One Fed seat was vacant in June but has since been filled.    According to the minutes, the majority of the committee in June was worried that &quot;excessive&quot; growth in the economy might lead to accelerating increases in wages and prices because so many factories were operating near full capacity and the unemployment rate was so low.    &quot;By some measures, prices had risen somewhat more rapidly in recent months, although any associated worsening of inflationary expectations . . . appeared to have been muted,&quot; the minutes say.    They add, &quot;Reports from different parts of the country suggested that labor market conditions were relatively taut in many, but not all areas, but there were few reports of substantial acceleration in rates of wage increases.&quot; Yet the committee members noted that many business executives &quot;were expressing concern about their continuing ability to restrain demands for higher wages.&quot;    In addition, some members argued that the Fed had to tighten its grip on credit to avoid &quot;any impression of a reversal in what was widely perceived as the thrust of policy in recent months,&quot; the minutes report. &quot;Several observed that the tightening actions of recent months had had a salutary effect on financial markets.&quot;    The minutes note that the value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets could affect the timing of policy changes. Tighter credit conditions mean higher interest rates. And higher interest rates attract foreign investors, pushing up the dollar.    Mr. Angell, however, sought a pause in the Fed's &quot;process of continuous tightening&quot; to see how much impact previous moves had had on the economy. Mr. Kelley suggested that the economy might already be slowing down, though he added that he was prepared to tighten further if any signs of increased inflationary pressure emerged. Ms. Seger also argued that the economy already had slowed and that tightening &quot;represented an unwarranted risk.&quot;    In congressional testimony in the weeks after the meeting, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that the Fed was prepared to nudge up interest rates to head off inflation, but he didn't explicitly say that the agency was doing so. </TEXT></DOC>
