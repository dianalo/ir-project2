The Swedish farm-equipment and food-processing group reaffirmed its forecast for &quot;significantly increased&quot; pretax profit for the full year, but it didn't elaborate.    Alfa Laval said pretax profit in the eight months rose to 547 million Swedish kronor ($86 million) from 418 million kronor a year earlier.    Operating profit at the food-processing division soared to 139 million kronor, six times the year-earlier figure. The company said that because of an extensive restructuring, it couldn't give exact year-earlier profit figures for individual divisions. Orders booked by the food division jumped 43% to 3.4 billion kronor, including a 440 million-kronor order for margarine plants destined for the Soviet Union.    Overall, the company received orders totaling 9.29 billion kronor, up 21% from a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
