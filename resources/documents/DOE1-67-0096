Computerized tomography is superiorto angiographic and pneumoencephalographic examinations, in particularbecause it provides a direct and complete view of the entire tumor andsurrounding formations. It also provides information on the incorporationof the tumor into the sinus cavernosus. Classical pneumoencephalographicexamination is necessary to differentiate hypodense intrasellar adenomasfrom an empty sella and in particular to assess the relationship betweenthe tumor and the floor of the IIIrd ventricle of the brain. Lateraltomographic pneumoencephalograms visualize critical structures more accuratelyand clearly than reconstructed sagittal computed tomograms. (author).5 figs., 2 tabs., 22 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
