<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0976 </DOCNO><TEXT>It is noted that air-assisted atomizer spray flames encountered in furnaces,boilers, and gas turbine combustors possess a more complex structurethan homogeneous turbulent diffusion flames, due to the swirling motionintroduced into the fuel and air flows for the control of flame stability,length, combustion intensity, and efficiency. Detailed comparisons arepresented between burning and nonburning condition measurements of theseflames obtained by nonintrusive light scattering phase/Doppler detection.Spray structure is found to be drastically changed within the flame reactionzone, with changes in the magnitude and shape of drop number density,liquid flux, mean drop size diameter, and drop mean axial velocity radialdistributions. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
