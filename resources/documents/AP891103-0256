The study released Thursday by Chris van Wyk, chief executive ofthe Bankorp banking group, was described by financial writers asthe most definitive attempt yet to quantify the impact of sanctionson South Africa.   The study said sanctions and disinvestment measures since 1985had cost a cumulative 40 billion rand in foreign exchange,resulting in production losses of about 80 billion rand and a totalspending loss of 100 billion rand.   Based on the average value of the rand during the period, thecumulative foreign exchange loss would total about $16 billion, thetotal production loss about $32 billion, and the spending lossabout $45 billion.   Despite the sanctions, South Africa's economy still isconsidered the strongest and most diversified on the continent.   Van Wyk said the overall economic impact was similar to whatSouth Africa would have experienced had the price of gold, itsmajor export, averaged $200 an ounce instead of $400 over the pastfive years.   Interest rates and inflation have been higher, the rand weaker,wages lower, and growth, employment and spending levels much lowerthan they would have been without sanctions, he said.   About 80 percent of new job-seekers were blacks, van Wyk said.   ``The harshest burden of sanctions has fallen on them,'' hesaid. ``A continuation of existing trade and financial sanctionsthroughout the 1990s would render a million more black peoplejobless and 2 million more financially destitute.''   Sanctions had impaired South Africa's ability to reach its fullexport potential and had ``radicalized many young blacks to theleft and many white voters to the right,'' Van Wyk said. ``Themoderate center has been weakened, making a political settlementmuch more difficult.''   But there had also been some positive spinoffs, he said.``Economic considerations began to assume their rightful place ingovernment decision-making, along with ... commitment to conceptssuch as tax reform and privatization.''   Since 1985, several hundred foreign companies have pulled out ofSouth Africa, generally citing either financial concerns orpressure from anti-apartheid groups.   In the same period, most Western countries have imposed sometype of trade sanctions on South Africa, affecting exports of majorproducts such as coal and steel even though some new markets havebeen found in the Far East.</TEXT></DOC>
