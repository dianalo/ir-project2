It's not the software writers' fault. In overhauling the tax law, Congress created a labyrinth of rules and caveats that are almost impossible to translate into easy-to-understand programs.    The best advice may be for a taxpayer to spend money on an accountant instead -- although computer buffs with simple tax situations are likely to enjoy using the programs. &quot;If a fellow has a routine return and all he wants is a pretty way of putting numbers in the boxes, this is the way to do it,&quot; says Gregory G. Andresen, tax partner with Chicago-based accountants Blackman Kallick Bartelstein.    A bewildering array of tax-preparation packages is available. A recent Journal of Taxation review lists 74, ranging in price from less than $100 for most programs aimed at individuals to more than $2,500 for those geared to professional tax preparers. The professional models can crank out hundreds of returns and complete every form; they also include modules for each state and much more detail on the federal tax code than less expensive programs.    The programs do have certain benefits. For one thing, they can be entertaining, letting people with color monitors turn tax forms into rainbows of numbers and lines.    But they also help taxpayers deal with the complexity of the new tax law in a variety of ways. For example, users of TurboTax, a $75 perennial best seller from Chipsoft Inc., can flip to an advice section with a single keystroke.    The programs also can make plugging in numbers easier than shuffling through a tabletop of papers: They allow a user to move between related parts of various Internal Revenue Service forms by just pressing a button -- for example, from line 14 on Form 1040, referring to a taxpayer's capital gain or loss for the year, to Schedule D, where specific gains and losses are listed.    And the programs can help organize information. One favored use for them is to tote up what's in the &quot;shoe box,&quot; as Los Angeles tax lawyer C. David Anderson puts it. &quot;I'm one of those guys who throws receipts in a box and at the end of the year enters them on a spreadsheet.&quot; Mr. Anderson, who uses a Lotus 1-2-3 tax variation, says the software serves the function well, allowing him to enter items in different categories -- such as medical expenses in one column and business expenses in another -- then add them up and plug them in when he sits down to do his return.    Finally, some programs review completed returns and flag areas where data is missing or obviously wrong -- for instance, if someone lists one exemption and takes four.    But the programs also contain hazards and shortcomings. Often, their advice sections are simply abbreviated versions of the IRS code, and space limitations can make the tips too general to be helpful. The IRS code, for instance, takes three full pages to explain passive losses -- losses from investments where the taxpayer isn't actively involved in management -- but many programs have only a screen or two of explanation. So the fact that the law allows an individual to claim a maximum of $25,000 in passive losses may not be noted.    One company gave up trying to put it all on disk. Best Programs Inc., maker of a $75 package called PC/Tax Cut, set up a panel of tax specialists that the program's users can call for further advice -- at $1 a minute. &quot;A lot of people are panicking because of the new rules and think they're not going to get everything they need, so they want to talk to somebody as opposed to just using the program,&quot; says Deborah McGhee, a Best spokeswoman.    And the ever-thickening software manuals have &quot;buyer beware&quot; stamped all over them. Howard Soft's Tax Preparer offers a typical warning: &quot;Although Tax Preparer is a valuable computational aid, and has volumes of tax regulations built in, it is not a substitute for thinking. It provides mechanical assistance in the mathematics and printing of returns, not legal advice.&quot; Adds Mr. Andresen: &quot;The computer can't go to the IRS exam&quot; with the taxpayer. </TEXT></DOC>
