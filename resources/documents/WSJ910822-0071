You are concernedthat adjustment would threaten &quot;the integrity of the census.&quot;You are apparently less concerned that failure to adjust willthreaten the integrity of the American political system.   The Census Bureau has estimated an undercount of 5.2% ofall Hispanic-Americans, 4.8% of all African-Americans, and3.1% of all Asian- and Pacific Islander Americans. On theother hand, the estimated undercount of the entire populationwas only 2.1%, and the undercount of the white population waseven smaller. This tells us that if the census is notcorrected, members of ethnic minorities, and states andcities with large minority populations, will continue to beshortchanged in the distribution of power and wealth in theU.S. You may be comfortable with this result; I am outragedby it.</LP><TEXT>   In arguing against an adjustment, you state that thecensus should be limited to &quot;actual&quot; people. You object toincluding &quot;invented&quot; people. This is a disingenuous argument.The uncounted Americans are just as &quot;actual&quot; as those whowere counted; they are not simply an &quot;invention&quot; of anadjustment.   If &quot;inventing&quot; people by adjustment is offensive, isn't itequally offensive that the original census also included&quot;invented&quot; individuals? For example, if the mailed censusform was not returned from a housing unit and census workerswere unable to contact a resident of the unit, a &quot;lastresort&quot; process was used. That is, an educated guess was madeas to who might be living in the unit.   In fact, the original census counted 4.4 million peoplewho really weren't there, according to General AccountingOffice testimony before a House subcommittee in June. Somewere counted twice, some were improperly reported on censusforms, some were mistakenly added in the &quot;last resort&quot;process, and some resulted from other errors. In light ofthis, the argument that adjustment is faulty because it&quot;invents&quot; individuals is hard to take seriously.   Virtually all experts agree that there was an undercountof more than five million in the 1990 census. The onlylegitimate question is whether the adjusted count is closerto a true picture of the population of the U.S. than theuncorrected count. The adjustment process is one that hasbeen carefully developed by the Census Bureau itself over thepast decade. You suggest that adjustment would be acapitulation to &quot;special interests.&quot; The truth is just theopposite. Adjustment would demonstrate a commitment to givingall Americans their fair share of this country's politicalpower and financial resources.   Willie L.
