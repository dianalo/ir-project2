Gottschalk Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   Many higher-income taxpayers are taking a midsummer's look at their tax projections for this year and next.    And those reviews, accountants say, are causing a number of individuals to readjust their tax strategies.    &quot;For the average person, the new law may be simple,&quot; says Sidney Kess, a partner with the accounting firm Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. &quot;But that isn't the case for people in special situations. They are amazed at the effects of the new tax law and how complex the changes are.&quot;    James Avedisian, national director of financial planning for Coopers andamp; Lybrand, says that the most surprising thing he has seen among his firm's clients is that a large number weren't having enough taxes withheld from their paychecks.    Many people are stunned to find that they will be subject to the alternative minimum tax, says David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy and practice for Ernst andamp; Whinney. &quot;Their world has been turned upside down,&quot; he says.    The new law is providing more action than usual in the normally quiet summer months for some accounting firms. &quot;For the first time, I'm as busy in August as I was in April,&quot; says Warren Shine, a partner for Ernst andamp; Whinney. Scheduled one-hour meetings with clients to go over last year's taxes -- for those filing under the Aug. 15 extension -- stretched into three- and four-hour sessions as they planned for this year and next, he says.    Accountants warn that such reviews and planning are vital for higher-income taxpayers who haven't already done them. &quot;If they don't start now, people are going to be in for a rude awakening,&quot; adds Stuart R. Josephs, western regional director for Seidman andamp; Seidman/BDO.    Here is a midyear look at some strategies that may pay off next April 15:    INCOME   For most people, accountants advise deferring income when possible from 1987 to 1988 since tax rates are dropping next year. The highest of five tax brackets this year is 38.5%; in 1988, there are two tax brackets -- 15% and 28%, but actual rates next year go as high as 33% at certain income levels before dropping back to 28%. The potential tax reduction next year of up to 10.5% makes it worth considering a deferral of salary, interest and other income into 1988, says Mr. Berenson.    One caveat: The IRS will be scrutinizing such deferrals to make sure that they occur prior to when the money is earned. If they do, &quot;there shouldn't be much of a problem,&quot; Mr. Avedisian says. However, he warns, if a person takes a loan out from his or her company for the same amount as the deferred income, the IRS is likely to disallow the claim.    Mr. Shine says many of his clients in the top executive ranks are already taking steps to defer income. For most middle managers, however, income deferral isn't as practical because they find it more difficult to go without paychecks to accomplish a relatively small net tax savings.    People can defer investment income to 1988 by purchasing U.S. Treasury Bills and short-term certificates of deposit that mature next year, Mr. Kess says. They can also buy U.S. Savings EE bonds.    DEDUCTIONS   Deductions will be worth more this year since tax rates are going down in 1988. For the first time, there's a floor for miscellaneous deductions this year of 2% of adjusted gross income. So it makes sense to bunch as many deductions as possible into this year when tax rates are higher, says Julian Block, senior tax specialist at Prentice Hall Information Services Inc.    Some possibilities: prepay estimated state and local taxes; prepay alimony payments; make charitable contributions this year instead of next. But beware of taking five-year subscriptions for professional journals; the IRS will only accept one-fifth this year.    Also, the floor for medical expenses this year has been increased to 7.5% of adjusted gross income from 5%. Thus it might make sense to take an annual physical exam, or undergo elective surgery or other kinds of medical treatment not covered by insurance before the end of the year, Mr. Block says.    ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX   But if a taxpayer is subject to the alternative minimum tax, he or she should do just the opposite: accelerate income and defer deductions. Under that tax, a taxpayer pays at a rate of 21% but loses many deductions such as for state and local income and property taxes; tax-shelter losses and consumer interest also aren't deductible.    The minimum tax is most often triggered by big tax-shelter deductions, interest deductions or contributions of appreciated property, accountants say. People who own their own business and professionals such as doctors and lawyers who have some control over their income are in the best position to accelerate income to take advantage of the lower tax rate under the alternative minimum tax.    STOCK OPTIONS   A midyear tax review is especially important for executives deciding whether to exercise stock options this year, says Mr. Berenson. If the gain from exercising the option is large, it may result in an executive being subject to the alternative minimum tax rather than the regular tax.    Under the alternative minimum tax, he says, if a taxpayer exercises a qualified stock option but doesn't sell the stock, he or she is still taxed on the gain in &quot;phantom income&quot; -- or the difference between the exercise price and the trading price.    TRACING OF INTEREST   Since the IRS now has different rules governing interest from real estate, investments, personal and business activities, Mr. Berenson thinks it's a good idea for a person to set up a separate bank account for each.    Too many people use just one bank account and it's hard to prove where the money came from and where it went, he says. Real-estate interest is fully deductible up to the cost plus improvements of a first or second home. Investment interest is deductible up to the extent of net investment income. Personal, or consumer interest, is 65% deductible this year and 40% in 1988. Business interest is fully deductible.    WITHHOLDING   W4 withholding forms must be filed with an employer by Oct. 1. Since the tax rates are lower for most people, less money will be withheld for taxes. But at the same time more deductions, such as for sales taxes and IRAs, have been either eliminated or cut back. So unless they adjust their withholding, many people will face a big tax bill next April 15. </TEXT></DOC>
