The Monroe, Mich.-based thrift said it didn't admit or deny any previous violations, and that the resolution &quot;substantially concludes&quot; the governmental investigation into its practices. It also announced the details of its plan to restate earnings from fiscal years 1985 through 1987.    The investigation centered largely on the way Peoples Savings accounted for write-offs from certain loans, and the way it claimed gains on other transactions.    Peoples restated its net income for the year ended June 30, 1985, to $415,000 from the previously reported $887,000; for fiscal 1986 to $1.5 million from $2.5 million; for fiscal 1987 to $272,000 from a net loss of $240,000.    In total, the changes lowered the thrift's net worth, or assets minus liabilities, about $1 million, to $37 million. </TEXT></DOC>
