BellSouth reported a 23% drop in quarterly net income to$360.2 million, or 75 cents a share, from $469 million, or 97cents, the year before. And Southern New EnglandTelecommunications said profit dropped 13% to $35.7 million,or 59 cents a share, from $41.1 million, or 67 cents a share,in the year-earlier quarter.</LP><TEXT>   BellSouth's drop reflected one-time charges in the latestquarter that amounted to $66.6 million, or 13 cents a share,for the sale of the U.S. computer and data-processingequipment leasing portfolio, the sale of an overseas cellularresale operation, and a voluntary retirement program acceptedby 1,146 managers. In the 1989 quarter, the Atlanta-basedregional Bell company reported a one-time gain of $47.4million, or 10 cents a share, for payments related to thefailed attempt to merge BellSouth's cellular operations withthose of LIN Broadcasting.   Revenue in the 1990 quarter inched up about 1% to $3.65billion from $3.62 billion, as incentive regulation plansadopted by several states cut or capped rates. BellSouth saidthat six of the nine states in its region have adopted newregulatory schemes, and over the long run, they are expectedto benefit customers and shareholders. Generally, incentiveregulation limits rate increases but allows phone companiesto boost profit by operating more efficiently.   &quot;We regard these {regulatory} plans as an importantinvestment in the future,&quot; said BellSouth Chairman John L.Clendenin. Rate reductions ordered by regulators totaled $280million during 1990.   For the year, BellSouth's net income fell 6% to $1.63billion, or $3.38 a share, from $1.74 billion, or $3.64 ashare. Revenue rose 2.5% to $14.3 billion from $14 billion in1989.   The company said that the number of customer telephonelines rose 3.2% in 1990 to 17.5 million access lines. Minutesof use of the telephone network also increased, but at aslower pace than in recent years, in part reflecting theeconomic recession.   Meantime, the company's domestic cellular businesscontinued rapid growth. Its customer base rose 59% during theyear to 667,000, and BellSouth's mobile communicationsbusiness posted net income of $45 million in 1990, against a$5.2 million loss in 1989.   Meantime, Southern New England Telecommunications based inNew Haven, Conn., said that net income for 1990 was $126.6million, or $2.08 a share, down from $189.1 million, or $3.04a share, in 1989. Without one-time charges in 1990 and a gainin 1989, earnings would have dropped 9.5% to $2.48 a sharefrom $2.74.   The 1990 figures include one-time charges of $24.7million, or 40 cents a share. The charges, taken in the thirdquarter were for the write-down of accounts receivable and anincrease in the reserve for uncollectible accounts as well asa charge from the refinancing of high-coupon debentures. The1989 results include a gain of $19 million, or 30 cents ashare, from the phone company's interest in Lightnet, afiber-optics partnership.   Revenue for the year fell 3.1% to $1.62 billion from $1.67billion in 1989. For the quarter, revenue was $406.1 million,off nearly 4% from $422.6 million. In part, the lower revenuereflects a 5% rate cut in Connecticut that took effect lastJanuary.</TEXT></DOC>
