Regan, often at odds with first ladyNancy Reagan when he was White House chief of staff, now apparentlyhas alienated President Reagan with his forthcoming book.   The book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,''makes assertions about Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology that thepresident appears to view as a personal attack on his wife.   During a photo session at the start of a Cabinet meeting Friday,reporters asked Reagan whether he felt betrayed or angered by thebook.   ``Well, I will say this, that I would have preferred it if he'ddecided to attack me, and apparently from what we hear he's chosento attack my wife, and I don't look kindly upon that at all,'' thepresident replied.   Tom Dawson, a Regan spokesman, said Regan ``has had and willhave no comments regarding his book until it is published.'' Hesaid the book is expected to be in stores beginning Monday.   But Strobe Talbott, Washington bureau chief of Time magazine,which will publish excerpts of the book, said Friday that Regan'sbook ``paints an absolutely devastating picture of the Reaganadministration.''   ``It characterizes the kind of inside scene there to be a littlebit like the court of the Medicis ... with a little bit of LadyMacbeth and maybe the Keystone Cops.''   Talbott, in comments on the syndicated discussion show ``InsideWashington'' scheduled for broadcast today, said the book portraysan unidentified San Francisco astrologer friend of Mrs. Reagan as``a kind of absentee presence almost at the Cabinet table or atleast right outside the Oval Office, working first through Mrs.Reagan.''   An excerpt from Talbott's appearance on the show was airedFriday by WUSA-TV in Washington.   The president in the past has reacted sharply to criticism ofhis wife or suggestions that she interferes or has too great a rolein administration decision-making.   Regan, the president's former top staff aide and treasurysecretary, had an uneasy relationship with Mrs. Reagan, whoseopposition is widely believed to have been behind his ouster aschief of staff early last year.   The president in the past has praised Regan's contribution tohis administration, and the former Wall Street executive was one ofthe most enthusiastic and loyal defenders of Reagan policies.   During the aftermath of the Iran-Contra scandal, in which moneyfrom arms sales to Iran was diverted to the Nicaragua Contrarebels, Regan and the first lady had telephone arguments over howto handle the matter, reportedly ending with her hanging up on him.   In his book, Regan is said to reveal that Mrs. Reagan usedastrology to determine the timing of the president's speeches andtravel.   The president has denied that any of his decisions have beeninfluenced by astrology, in which the position of the sun, moon andstars are studied in the belief that they influence human affairs.   The White House says Mrs. Reagan has followed astrology sincebefore the Reagans came to the White House. Her interest washeightened by the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt against herhusband, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier this week.   Fitzwater said that as far as he knows, Reagan's interest inastrology is limited to reading his horoscope.   Reagan said Friday he did not expect Regan to send him a copy ofhis book, which is being published by Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich,``unless I'm prepared to send a check in return.''   The president previously has made disparaging comments aboutso-called ``kiss-and-tell'' books by former aides.   Last month, for example, he was asked his opinion of a book byformer White House spokesman Larry Speakes, in which Speakesrevealed that on two occasions he made up quotes and attributedthem to the president.   Reagan said last month he was not aware of Speakes' actions atthe time and added: ``I can tell you right now that I have noaffection for these kiss-and-tell books that are being written andI find it entirely fiction.''   Asked Friday what his book-writing advice would be for membersof his Cabinet and current aides, the president gestured around thetable and said, ``I trust all these people.''
