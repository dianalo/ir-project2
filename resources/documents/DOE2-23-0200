Itis shown that in the samples investigated near 268-250 and 203-193 Ktemperatures electrical field gradient occurrance may be observed whichis obviously conditioned by reduction of tin atom closest environmentsymmetry. The experimental data obtained testify to the local characterof structural changes.</TEXT></DOC>
