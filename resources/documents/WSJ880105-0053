Congress has enacted legislation raising corporate premiums to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., while requiring better financing for underfunded plans and added pension protection when plans are ended. Bell Atlantic Corp. says it &quot;can live with&quot; a yearly premium of $16, up from $8.50 per worker. Columbia Gas System Inc. calls the new pension rules &quot;prudent.&quot;    But though employers with underfunded plans must pay up to $50 per worker in annual premiums, K mart, Comerica Inc. and USX Corp. complain that the new schedule still penalizes fully funded plans by raising their fees too. USX spokesman William Keslar says the boost means a &quot;financial burden&quot; for its plan, which, he says, is one of the few well-heeled steel-company plans.    The new rules will force employers to look harder at pension-benefit costs, says PBGC official Kathleen Utgoff.    FACULTY AND COLUMNISTS aren't hired hands, the courts say.    A federal appeals court backs a National Labor Relations Board ruling that Boston University faculty members can't form a union. Judge Juan Torruella, citing a 1980 Supreme Court decision involving New York's Yeshiva University, said that since the faculty is &quot;predominant&quot; in a college's main teaching and research role, it is clearly managerial. Unions aren't suitable for higher education, Boston University President Jon Westling adds.    Separately, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker rejects a claim by a former Washington Times radio and TV columnist for overtime pay. The court contrasted a columnist's &quot;creative, opinionated, critical&quot; work with objective news reporting, that it said does merit overtime pay. The columnist plans an appeal.    UNIONS SEEK more shareholder support for labor causes.    The Clothing and Textile Workers and Carpenters unions presented three asbestos-related resolutions at the recent Echlin Inc. annual meeting claiming support from about 20 institutional investors with holdings in the auto-parts maker. An official of a Midwest bank's trust department said the resolutions &quot;made a lot of sense.&quot; The Kamber Group, labor consultants, predicts &quot;a lot more&quot; union stockholder activity.    The Carpenters pension fund plans shareholder resolutions this year attacking anti-merger policies of MCA Inc., Champion International, Weyerhaeuser Co. and Boise Cascade; merger threats impel better management, the union says. The Sheet Metal Workers may use its fund to help shape corporate policies.    An AFL-CIO &quot;investment tracking system&quot; now tells unions how 100 union pension funds use their holdings.    THEY WON'T GO: Employees resist moving to high-cost cities, 82% of the 143 relocation administrators surveyed by Runzheimer International, consultants, said. A third of respondents said the resistance is rising. The New York area was named least popular by 73%, followed by Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco and Washington.    I'M TOO OLD to be hired, said 36% of more than 1,000 jobless workers who phoned Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas Inc. on Dec. 31, when the Chicago placement firm offered a day of free job-search advice. But the firm says that last year it took workers aged 50 or older only slightly more than the three-month average for any job search.    FARM-ACREAGE REDUCTIONS under federal subsidy programs cost nearly 300,000 potential agriculture-related jobs in 1987, concludes a study by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, an Agriculture Department unit. The cuts are mandated to help limit crop surpluses and keep farm prices up.    WE'RE OK, ARE YOU? Consultants say the stock-market crash hurt consultants very little. The 48 firms polled at the ACME Inc., management consultants group, annual meeting at Sea Island, Ga., eased their forecast for 1988 revenues to an 18% rise, from an earlier 20% forecast; they say customers still need productivity and other data.    EMPLOYERS SEE FIT to add more &quot;wellness&quot; programs for worker health. About 66% of sites with at least 50 workers now have wellness programs, says the Prevention Leadership Forum, a joint effort of a private Washington, D.C., health group and the government. McKesson Corp. opens its executive dietary counseling, aerobic training and diagnostic testing program to all workers. Bechtel Group Inc. starts noon lectures on topics such as controlling stress and early breast-cancer detection.    Dow Jones andamp; Co. will soon offer smokers free tuition for smoking-cessation sessions, as it moves to end workplace smoking. American Express opens a lower-Manhattan fitness center, with $300,000 worth of equipment and a staff of 25. Regular users &quot;say they feel better,&quot; which means more productivity, Amex says.    John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. emphasizes low-calorie eating; its cafeteria serves one such meal a day.    THE CHECKOFF: Unions from 15 nations meet in Florida for the first conference on pay and other labor issues for workers who make and service space vehicles. . . . Preretirement planning is offered employees of nearly half of 269 companies polled by Towers Perrin, consultants. . . . Conference Board labor economist Richard Belous bets his boss, Audrey Freedman, $5 that her prediction of a recession by mid-1988will be wrong. </TEXT></DOC>
