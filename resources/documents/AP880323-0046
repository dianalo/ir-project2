Former President Chun Doo-hwan's younger brother, ChunKyung-hwan, is the focus of the scandal, an investigation intocharges leaders of the powerful Saemaul Undong development groupused government connections to amass fortunes. Prosecutors saydozens of government officials also have been implicated.   Political observers say the Saemaul revelations are amongefforts by Roh to discredit Chun Doo-hwan by exposing corruptionunder his government. Chun, who stepped down Feb. 25, has beenfighting to retain power within the government.   Chun Kyung-hwan, the former leader of Saemaul (New Community),became among the country's most powerful figures while ChunDoo-hwan was in power.   Many Koreans believe there was corruption under President Chun,much of it centered around his family. The Korea Times, in aneditorial Tuesday, said the Saemaul affair ``should be consideredtypical of the ... unjust practices during the precedinggovernment.''   Former President Chun, who has not been implicated directly inthe scandal, was to meet today with President Reagan in Washington.He is on a private tour of the United States that includes meetingswith many top American officials.   The investigation and the constant stream of revelations wouldnot be possible without high-level government backing, according toofficials and observers, who declined to be identified further.   ``You can be sure this is coming direct from the Blue House(presidential mansion),'' said one official.   The Prosecutors General office says an initial investigation ofthe Saemaul group indicates the younger Chun and other topofficials embezzled government and private subsidies, forcedcorporations to make illegal donations and peddled governmentinfluence and contacts. News reports indicate up to $50 millioncould be involved.   Prosecutor Kang Won-Il, who is heading the investigation, saysofficials of the Home, Agriculture and Fisheries, Education, andSports ministries are also being investigated for aiding Saemaulofficials or covering up fraud to protect President Chun and hisfamily.   Saemaul has evolved into a huge organization since its creationin 1971 to promote urban and rural development, with activitiesranging from construction of model communities and organizing citydwellers to keep neighborhoods clean.   Opposition supporters and other critics contend Saemaul also hasworked closely with the country's authoritarian governments in thepast, organizing government support and handing out patronage.   The younger Chun, who resigned in 1987 after being linked togangsters locked in a bloody power struggle, fled briefly to Japanlast Friday when details of the investigation were made public.   The former Saemaul chief, who was appointed by his brother, saidafter returning that there had been irregularities, but gave nodetails.   Dozens of Saemaul officials and their wives are being questionedand have been barred from leaving the country.   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun into power with armybacking in 1980, has been trying to distance himself from hishighly unpopular predecessor and to take complete control of thegovernment.   The two men had been close since their days in the armed forcesand Chun picked Roh to be his successor. But Roh started todistance himself from Chun when massive anti-government protestsoccurred last summer.   Roh backed opposition demands for elections held in Decemberthat he won with 36.6 percent of the vote after rival oppositioncandidates split the anti-government vote.   The new president has resisted Chun's attempts to retain power,ousting many of the former president's supporters from thegoverning Democratic Justice Party. Roh also curtailed plans forChun to act as a senior adviser to the government, reducing thepost to a largely ceremonial role.   Roh has promised to end decades of authoritarian rule andintroduce sweeping democratic reforms and is anxious to buildpopular support. On the campaign trail, he vowed that any officialcorruption under the Chun government would not go unpunished.   Daily revelations about the Saemaul probe have received maximumattention in the media. The state-run television networks devotemuch of their nightly news programs to the affair.   But some Democratic Justice Party leaders and other officialsare concerned the effort to discredit Chun could backfire. Theopposition Party for Peace and Democracy has charged that Roh aidedSaemaul corruption while he was Home Minister in 1982 and demandedhe be investigated.   The governing party also is worried that corruption revelationscould hurt its chances in National Assembly elections, which are tobe held next month.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Renfrew, the AP bureau chief in Seoul, hascovered Asia for the past five years.</TEXT></DOC>
