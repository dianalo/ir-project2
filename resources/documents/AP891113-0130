William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, whereCarol and Charles Stuart were attacked, pleaded not guilty tocharges he held up a Brookline video store on Oct. 2. He was beingheld on $35,000 cash bail at the Norfolk County House ofCorrections.   Bennett, who has been identified in published reports as asuspect in the Stuart slaying, was arrested Saturday at hisgirlfriend's Burlington home on charges of driving on a revokedlicense.   The motor vehicles case was postponed in a Charlestown court,where attorney Judith Lindahl appeared in Bennett's defense.Lindahl said she had been contacted by the Committee for PublicCounsel to defend whomever might be charged in connection with theStuart shootings.   Asked if she thought Bennett might be charged in connection withthose shootings, she said: ``I have no inside knowledge on what theD.A.'s office will do.'' She had said earlier in the day that if heis charged ``there is sufficient publicity in the case to deny myclient a fair trial.''   Bennett's mother, Pauline, told the Boston Herald that her sonwas a suspect in the shooting that fatally wounded Mrs. Stuart andher infant son, Christopher, as well as injuring Charles Stuart.   Mrs. Stuart, 30, died after she was shot by a man who abductedher and her husband on Oct. 23 just as they were leaving Brighamand Womens' Hospital, where they had attended a birthing class.   Stuart, 29, was listed in stable condition Monday in intensivecare after having surgery Saturday at Boston City Hospital, buthospital officials would not give a reason for the surgery.   The infant was delivered by Caesarean section and clung to lifefor more than two weeks before succumbing to a respiratory ailmentThursday. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide.   In the Brookline courtroom, Crowley granted a motion by attorneyJoel Goodman to let Bennett sit concealed behind the witness stand.   Goodman said the repeated publication of Bennett's picture couldbias witnesses or potential jurors.   Bennett's presence in the Charlestown court had been waivedbecause of the publicity surrounding his arrest.</TEXT></DOC>
