(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A grand jury indicted 13 people on chargesthey conspired to defraud a federally subsidized housing programthat was designed to help low-income residents become homeowners.   The indictments, which followed a two-year investigation of aBrookhaven program called Save-a-House, were handed up Wednesday.Two of the 13 charged are former law enforcement officers.   ``We're talking about people that would steal the pennies off adead man's eyes,'' said Suffolk County District Attorney PatrickHenry.   The charges come at a time of numerous reports of fraud,corruption and influence-peddling in similar programs funded by theU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development across the country.   Under the Save-a-House program, 18 houses were designated to besold to low-income families for $500 each.   The indictment alleges that 14 of these homes were fraudulentlyobtained for between $500 to $5,000 by people representingthemselves as eligible recipients under the HUD guidelines.   ``These people are devoid of any conscience,'' Henry said. ``Thesad part is that they deprived deserving families of a roof overtheir heads.''   A source close to the investigation who spoke on condition ofanonymity said that the investigation was proceeding into allhousing programs in Suffolk County that received federal fundsduring the past eight years.   More indictments are expected, the source said.   All of the people who allegedly bought the houses fraudulentlywere either close friends or relatives of three of the defendants:Thomas Brazier, 43, of Westhampton, a former U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms agent; Albert Iannuzzi, 45, of Smithtown, aformer Suffolk police officer; and Garrett Story, 50, of Bellport.   They were charged with grand larceny.   The three defendants still control the houses through their realestate companies and rented out the houses for an average of $800 amonth, in some cases to people whose rent is subsidized by welfare.   James O'Rourke, defense attorney for Brazier and Iannuzzi, saidthe charges were part of a vendetta against his clients.   ``They didn't do anything illegal, or criminal,'' O'Rourke said.``An opportunity was presented and they took advantage of anopportunity.''   The 13 each pleaded innocent at arraignments in Suffolk CountyCourt. Some were released on their own recognizances. Others hadbail set from between $5,000 to $25,000.   Only one of the 13 was not a friend or relative of Brazier,Iannuzzi, or Story.   Linda Spahr, the assistant district attorney who led the probe,said that investigators are still searching for the county employeewho approved the applications for the houses.</TEXT></DOC>
