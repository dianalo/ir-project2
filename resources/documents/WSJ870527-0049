The two were among 10 current and former Brooks employees who were arrested in a widely publicized narcotics case last month.    Ellen Estella, a former receptionist at the firm, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to selling about one ounce of cocaine to a Drug Enforcement Administration undercover agent in July 1986. Paul Lucchi, a former stockbroker, pleaded guilty to conspiring, allegedly with two other Brooks colleagues, to sell a small amount of cocaine to another undercover agent. The two will be sentenced later this year. The cases of the other eight are pending.    The narcotics case focused on two New York offices of Brooks, which specializes in over-the-counter stocks. </TEXT></DOC>
