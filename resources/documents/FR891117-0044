Enterprises,with an address of 2154 76th Street, Brooklyn, New York 11214, and allsuccessors, and assignees, officers, partners, representatives, agentsand employees are hereby denied for a period of one year from the datehereof all privileges of participating, directly or indirectly, in anytransaction involving commodities or technical data exported from the UnitedStates in whole or in part, to be exported, or that are otherwise subjectto the Export Administration Regulations (``Regulations'').\1\<NOTE/> Beginning on the date of this final agency action, the denialof export privileges set forth above shall be suspended, as authorizedby andSection; 788.16(c) of the Regulations, for one year, and shall be terminatedthereafter, provided that Respondent has committed no further violationsof the Export Administration Act, the Regulations, or the final Order issuedin this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Effective October 1, 1988, the Regulations were redesignatedas parts 768-799 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 53 FR37751 (September 28, 1988). The transfer merely changed the first numberof each part from ``3'' to ``7''. Until such time as the Code of FederalRegulations is republished, the Regulations can be found at 15 CFR parts368-399 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On March 17, 1989, the Office of Export Enforcement, U.S. Department ofCommerce (``Agency''), issued a charging letter against Respondent, A.M.Y.Enterprises, alleging multiple violations of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C., app. 2401-2420 (Supp. 1989)) (``theAct''), and Regulations. Respondent answered the charging letter and deniedthe charges. Subsequently, the Agency and Respondent entered into a consentagreement and, on August 21, 1989, the Agency submitted the agreement tothe ALJ for his consideration. The ALJ approved the consent agreement onOctober 6, 1989, finding its terms to be reasonable. The ALJ also foundthat Respondent had committed one violation of the Act and Regulations,which violation Respondent admitted in the consent agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>On October 6, 1989, the ALJ issued his Recommended Order in this proceedingapproving the consent agreement as negotiated by the parties. RecommendedOrder at 11. In his Recommended Order, however, the ALJ makes two misstatementswhich I am hereby modifying in this Order. Initially, the ALJ states that ``[a] central issue in this proceeding isthe need for findings [of violation] by this Tribunal in reviewing consentagreement cases.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 3 (emphasis added). The ALJ correctly notes the recentconfusion concerning the necessity of finding violations in consent proceedingsconducted pursuant to andSection; 788.17(a)(2). In summarizing the earlierdecisions in <T3>Behar, Hon Kwan Yu, </T3>and <T3>Smit, </T3>however, the ALJ incorrectly concludes that ``a findingof violation by Respondent A.M.Y. Enterprises should be made here.'' <T3>Id</T3>. at 10 (emphasis added). This issue was resolved recently in<T3>In the Matter of Bernardus Johannes Jozef Smit, </T3>54 FR 39027 (Sept.22, 1989). <T3>Smit </T3>specifically held that ``neither the Act nor the Regulationsrequire that a finding of violation be made in order to impose sanctionsunder a consent agreement'' (54 FR at 39028). To the extent that thereis any remaining uncertainty with respect to this issue, I reaffirm thatholding here_there is no requirement for a finding of violation to imposea civil penalty in consent proceedings brought pursuant to andSection; 788.17(a)(2).In fact, andSection; 788.17(a)(2) provides that the ALJ will issue only arecommended order in approving a consent agreement submitted pursuant tothat section. <T3>Id</T3>. (emphasis added). Thus, it appears that once the ALJ approvesa consent agreement filed pursuant to andSection; 788.17(a)(2), he shouldnot be issuing a recommended decision (including findings of fact, conclusionsof law, and findings of violation) regarding such consent agreement. Ofcourse, if the ALJ has any objection to the proposed consent agreement,he retains the discretion to reject such agreement under andSection; 788.17(a).In addition to the above error, the ALJ made an apparently unintended misstatementin his Recommended Order regarding the suspension of Respondent's denialperiod. Under the terms of the consent agreement, the parties agreed thatthe appropriate sanction would be suspended one-year denial of all U.S.export privileges. As the ALJ specifically observed: ``To settle the admittedviolation * * *, the parties agreed that a one-year denial of U.S. exportprivileges would be imposed on Respondent, and that this one-year denialwould be suspended.'' Recommended Order at 2 (emphasis added). The ALJfound the terms of the Consent Agreement reasonable, approved the Agreement,and stated his intent to implement the ``agreed sanction * * *_a suspendedone-year denial of export privileges.'' <T3>Id</T3>. While it is clear that the ALJ intended that Respondent'sone-year denial period be suspended for one year beginning on the dateof the entry of the final agency action, the ALJ's Recommended Order isunclear in that regard. To the extent that the ALJ's Recommended Orderindicates that the denial period is not suspended until one year from theentry of this Final Order, the Recommended Order is modified. Accordingly, I hereby modify the ALJ's October 6, 1989 recommended Decisionand Order to read as follows: \2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In order to avoid any confusion regarding what terms ofthe ALJ's Recommended Order apply, I have set forth herein a complete orderin this case. Accordingly, since this order constitutes the final agencyorder in this proceeding, and since it does not incorporate the ALJ's RecommendedOrder, the latter is not being published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>I. The ALJ's Decision to affirm the Consent Agreement, as negotiated bythe parties to settle this case, is hereby affirmed, striking that portionof the Decision and Order which states that the ALJ is required to findviolation in a consent proceeding.

Enterprises began with the issuanceMarch 17, 1989 of a charging letter by the Office of Export Enforcement(``the Agency''), Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.This letter was issued under the authority of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979 (50 U.S.C.A. app. 2401-2420), as amended (``the Act''), andthe Export Administration Regulations (``the Regulations'').\1\<NOTE/> The charging letter alleged that in August 1988 Respondenthad violated andSection; 787.3(a), 787.3(b), 787.5(a)(1)(ii), and 787.10of the Regulations in connection with the attempted export of computerequipment from the United States to Venezuela.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988).</ITAG>Respondent answered the charging letter with a denial of its allegations.At a time in the proceeding when Respondent was in default, the Agencysubmitted for the record its evidence supporting the charges. SubsequentlyRespondent cured its procedural default, and the parties submitted a ConsentAgreement. In the Consent Agreement, Respondent admitted that it violatedandSection; 787.3(b) of the Regulations, as alleged in the charging letter,and the Agency agreed to seek withdrawal, without prejudice, of its chargesthat Respondent violated also three other sections. To settle the admittedviolation of andSection; 787.3(b), the parties agreed that a one-year denialof U.S. export privileges would be imposed on Respondent, and that thisone-year denial would be suspended. The Agency petitioned this Tribunalfor leave to withdraw without prejudice its three remaining charges.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub.

The equipment was seized by theAgency several hours before it was to leave by air for Venezuela, becauseits shipping documents cited an export licenser that in fact covered theshipment of different computer equipment.In connection with this attempted export, Respondent admitted in the ConsentAgreement that from about August 1 to August 27, 1988 it conspired withtwo others to export the equipment without the required export license,in violation of andSection; 787.3(b) of the Regulations. As noted, the Agencyagreed in the Consent Agreement to withdraw its other three charges. Thesethree were: Attempting an unauthorized export, in violation of andSection;787.3(a); misrepresentations on shipping documents, in violation of andSection;787.5(a)(1)(ii); and unauthorized use of the export license for the differentcomputer equipment, in violation of andSection; 787.10.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue</ITAG>A central issue in this proceeding is the need for findings by this Tribunalin reviewing consent agreement cases. Three recent decisions by the UnderSecretary for Export Administration have addressed this issue, and havearrived at two different outcomes.The first case was <T3>In the Matter of Robert Behar,</T3> 53 FR 48666 (Dec. 2, 1988). In<T3>Behar,</T3> a consent agreement was submitted in which the respondents``admit[ted] that the facts are as stated in the Charging Letter,'' andagreed with the Agency upon the imposition of a civil penalty. The AdministrativeLaw Judge presiding in that case approved the consent agreement, and alsofound, based on the respondents' admission of the facts in the ChargingLetter, that they had committed the violations alleged therein. Both theAgency and the respondents challenged that finding when the case was referredby the Administrative Law Judge to the Under Secretary, arguing that therespondents had admitted only that certain facts were true, not that theyhad committed any violations.The Under Secretary affirmed the approval of the consent agreement, andfurther ruled in favor of the Administrative Law Judge on the disputedfinding. Here the Under Secretary declared: ``Indeed, the Under Secretary'sauthority for imposing civil penalties in such cases [consent agreementcases] is based on the finding of a violation'' (<T3>Behar,</T3> 53 FR 48666, 48667). Moreover, ``For Export AdministrationAct cases in which there will be the imposition of a penalty, whether adenial period with respect to export privileges, a fine, or both, theremust be some finding by the Under Secretary of a violation to support theimposition of the penalty'' (emphasis added) (<T3>id.</T3>).The Agency filed a motion in <T3>Behar</T3> for the Under Secretary to reconsider his ruling in favorof the finding of violations. Before that motion was decided, the secondcase to present the issue emerged: <T3>In the Matter of Hon Kwan Yu, individually and doing business as SeedH.K. Ltd.,</T3> 54 FR 11427 (Mar. 20, 1989). In <T3>Yu,</T3> the parties submitted a consent agreement in which the respondentsagreed with the Agency on a civil penalty and a denial period, but admittednothing regarding facts or violations. The Agency, citing its then pendingmotion for reconsideration in <T3>Behar,</T3> argued again that the final decision should contain nofinding of a violation.Eventually <T3>Yu</T3> became a default proceeding because the respondents, claimingbudgetary constraints, declined to participate in additional steps scheduledin the case. The presiding Administrative Law Judge ruled for the Agencyin a default decision, imposing the sanctions stipulated in the consentagreement. The Administrative Law Judge included in the decision a finding,based on evidence submitted by the Agency, that the respondents had committedthe alleged violations. When the case was referred to the Under Secretary,the Agency again argued that consent agreement cases required no findingof a violation, citing its still pending motion for reconsideration in<T3>Behar.</T3>The Under Secretary, with some adjustment of the provisions for suspension,affirmed the denial period and civil penalty stipulated in the parties'consent agreement and imposed by the Administrative Law Judge, but focusedhis decision primarily on the pending <T3>Behar</T3> issue. To identify that issue, the Under Secretary restatedthe <T3>Behar</T3> ruling that was under challenge by the Agency: ``[W]herethere is to be a penalty imposed, whether a denial period with respectto export privileges, a fine, or both, there must be some finding by theUnder Secretary_and hence the ALJ_of a violation of the Act to supportthe imposition of that penalty'' (54 FR 11427).  After an extensive discussion of the pertinent law, the Under Secretaryrejected the Agency's challenge to his <T3>Behar</T3> ruling. The Under Secretary's Order in <T3>Yu</T3> consisted of two parts: Affirming, as noted above, a denialperiod and a civil penalty for the respondents; and stating that ``Thedecision in <T3>In re Behar</T3> * * * is reaffirmed'' (54 FR 11427, 11429).  Thus stood the situation when the final of the three consent agreementcases addressing the issue went to the Under Secretary: <T3>In the Matter of Bernardus Johannes Jozef Smit, </T3>54 FR 39027 (Sept.22, 1989). In <T3>Smit</T3>, the parties submitted a consent agreement in which the respondentagreed with the Agency on a civil penalty and a denial period, but admittednothing regarding facts or violations. As in <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>, the consent agreement in <T3>Smit</T3> was accompanied by a proposed decision and order implementingit; but the Agency made to the presiding Administrative Law Judge no challengeto the <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3> rulings that imposition of an administrative sanction in consentcases requires the finding of a violation.  The Administrative Law Judge approved the consent agreement and imposedthe sanctions stipulated therein. Further, in accord with the Under Secretary's<T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3> decisions, the Administrative Law Judge included a finding,based on evidence submitted by the Agency, that the respondent had committedthe alleged violations. When the case was referred to the Under Secretary,both the Agency and the respondent objected to the inclusion of this finding.The Agency's brief advanced substantially the same arguments as in itsmotion to reconsider <T3>Behar</T3>.  This time, however, the result was different from that in <T3>Behar</T3>, as reaffirmed in <T3>Yu</T3>. Those two decisions by the Under Secretary had held, as quotedabove, that a finding of a violation is required for imposing sanctionsin consent agreement cases. In <T3>Smit</T3>, the Under Secretary now declared: ``Neither the Act northe Regulations requires that a finding of violation be made in order toimpose sanctions under a consent agreement'' (54 FR 39027, 39028).  That quotation was one of two conclusions advanced by the Under Secretaryin his <T3>Smit</T3> discussion of any need for a finding of violation in consentagreement cases. In the other conclusion, the Under Secretary adopted theagrument_which the Under Secretary had rejected in <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>_that the finding of violation conflicted with the terms ofthe consent agreement. Consequently, in <T3>Smit</T3> the Under Secretary affirmed the sanctions stipulated inthe consent agreement, but deleted the finding that the respondent hadcommitted the alleged violations.  What is the connection between <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>, on the one hand, and <T3>Smit</T3> on the other? They were all decided within ten months time.In its <T3>Smit</T3> brief to the Under Secretary, the agency faced up to thisquestion squarely. <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>, stated the Agency ``held that, where a penalty is imposed,whether a denial of export privileges, a civil penalty, or both there mustbe a finding of a violation to support the imposition of that penalty;''and <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3> the Agency contended, <T3>``were incorrect'' </T3>(emphasis in original) (Agency's August 28,1989 Submission 3).  The Under Secretary declined the Agency's invitation to address this contention.His textual discussion in the <T3>Smit</T3> decision of any need to find a violation was extensive, butit omitted any mention of either <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>. In a footnote, <T3>Smit</T3> did cite differences between that case and those two priorones (54 FR 39027, 39028 n.2). <T3>Behar</T3> the footnote said, had involved the respondent's admissionof the facts alleged in the charging letter, a factor absent from <T3>Smit</T3>. <T3>Yu</T3>, the footnote said, was a default, not a consent agreement,case.  That <T3>Smit </T3>footnote began its <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3> references by stating: ``Prior decisions have ruled that afinding of violation would be necessary under certain circumstances inorder to impose sanctions'' (<T3>id.</T3>). The next footnote in <T3>Smit</T3> stated clearly: ``A careful reading of this section [andSection;788.17of the Regulations, which governs consent proceedings] shows that <T3>it is not appropriate to make a finding of violation in consent proceedings</T3>* * *'' (emphasis added) (54 FR 39027, 39029 n. 3). The previous footnote,the only reference in <T3>Smit</T3> to <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>, ended simply: ``To the extent that <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Hon Kwan Yu</T3> are inconsistent with the conclusion I reach here,I decline to follow these decisions'' (54 F.R. 39027, 39028 n.2).  The issue for the moment, in view of <T3>Behar</T3>, <T3>Yu</T3>, and <T3>Smit</T3>, is to determine the proper disposition of the case at hand.Respondent A.M.Y. Enterprises, in its consent agreement, admitted to commissionof a violation; and the Agency had previously submitted evidence of theviolation. Per <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>, a finding of violation is required to support imposition ofthe sanction stipulated by the consent agreement. Per <T3>Smit</T3>, such a finding is ``not appropriate,'' although the UnderSecretary declined the Agency's invitation to overrule <T3>Behar</T3> and <T3>Yu</T3>. But even by <T3>Smit's</T3> reasoning, such a finding for Respondent A.M.Y. Enterpriseswould seem, although not mandatory, still unobjectionable, since it wouldnot conflict with the terms of Respondent A.M.Y. Enterprises' consent agreement. Therefore a plausible reading of <T3>Behar</T3> <T3>Yu</T3>, and <T3>Smit</T3> in combination suggests that a finding of violation by RespondentA.M.Y. Enterprises should be made here. That interpretation is fortifiedby a consent agreement case that went to the Under Secretary after <T3>Smit</T3>, and that was decided by him before <T3>Smit</T3>. In <T3>In the Matter of Ruben Sanchez, individually and doing business asOficina Tecnica Ruben Sanchez CA,</T3> 54 FR 39026 (Sept. 22, 1989), theparties submitted a consent agreement in which the respondents agreed withthe Agency on a denial period and admitted one violation. The record containedevidence of that violation.  The decision of the Administrative Law Judge approved the consent agreement,imposed the denial period, and introduced a finding of violation by therespondent; and this decision was routinely affirmed by the Under Secretarywithout analysis. Consequently, <T3>Sanchez </T3>provides support for including a finding of violationin the instant decision.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion    </ITAG>The evidence introduced by the Agency is sufficient to show that RespondentA.M.Y. Enterprises conspired with two others from about August 1 to August27, 1988 to export computer equipment from the United States to Venezuelawithout the required export license. Accordingly, Respondent is found tohave violated andSection; 787.3(b) of the Regulations, as alleged in thecharging letter.The Consent Agreement negotiated by the parties to settle this case isreasonable, and its terms are approved by the undersigned. Accordingly,the Agency's petition for leave to withdraw without prejudice its chargesthat Respondent violated andSection;andSection; 787.3(a), 787.5(a)(1)(ii),and 787.10 of the Regulations is granted, and the agreed sanction for Respondent'sadmitted violation of Section 787.3(b)_a suspended one year denial of exportprivileges_is implemented by the Order set forth below.
