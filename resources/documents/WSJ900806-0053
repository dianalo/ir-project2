The prospect of shrinking supplies from the Middle Eastpropelled oil shares higher Thursday and Friday morning eventhough stock prices generally were collapsing. Although theoils weakened Friday afternoon on profit-taking, many marketstrategists believe more gains lie ahead as oil pricesstabilize at higher levels.</LP><TEXT>   Now that the first indiscriminate surge in oil stocks isover, analysts are left to ponder which companies will behelped most by the expected higher prices for crude.   &quot;My oil-price forecast is that oil prices will be whateverMr. Hussein says that he wants them to be,&quot; says a Fridaymarket bulletin from Robert A. Brusca, chief economist forNikko Securities Co. International.   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait &quot;could lead down 50 differentpaths, and 40 or 45 of them mean higher oil prices,&quot; saysStephen A. Smith of Bear Stearns.   &quot;The whole stock market, unfortunately, is going down, andoil basically is the only game in town,&quot; said Kidder Peabodyanalyst William Brown in a Wall Street Journal televisioninterview Friday.   Charles Maxwell of C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell, oftenconsidered the dean of oil analysts, thinks oil prices willaverage about $24 a barrel next year, up from about $20 thisyear and $19.50 last year.   To Bernard J. Picchi, Salomon Brothers' oil specialist,companies involved mainly in exploration and production havethe advantage over those that also do a lot of refining andmarketing. For explorers, higher oil prices are a blessing.For refiners, they're an added cost.   Accordingly, Mr. Picchi's favorites are Oryx Energy andLouisiana Land andamp; Exploration. Both areexploration-and-production companies, both are mainlydomestic, and both produce a lot of natural gas.   At the moment, Mr. Picchi notes, natural gas can produce agiven quantity of energy more cheaply than oil. And naturalgas is less polluting. Yet natural gas stocks haven't movedup as much as oil stocks, partly because much gas use isseasonal -- for home heating.   After the pure explorers and producers, his next choiceslie in the realm of the big integrated companies -- thosethat do refining and marketing of petroleum products, as wellas exploration and production. Mr. Picchi prefers those thatare &quot;more production oriented,&quot; such as Atlantic Richfieldand Pennzoil.   In the next tier, he places the large international oilslike Royal Dutch/Shell, Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and BritishPetroleum. He says they're too large to grow very fast, andthey &quot;tend to be fairly large refiners.&quot; They &quot;will benefit,but less than the first category,&quot; he says.   Mr. Picchi says he'd be least likely to buy smallerintegrated oil companies &quot;that have been mentioned repeatedlyas acquisition candidates&quot; such as Murphy Oil, Amerada Hess,and Kerr-McGee. In many cases they're &quot;very fine companies,&quot;he says, but takeover speculation has bid up their prices toomuch.   Mr. Maxwell, the industry veteran, sees thingsdifferently. He says people look down their noses at refiningbecause the business was typically unprofitable in the past.But that reputation stems from the days when explorationenjoyed big tax advantages. Back then, it was in the oilcompanies' interest to run their business so that the profitswere attributed to the exploration side.   Now the tax code has changed, he says, so this incentivehas vanished. Meanwhile, by his calculations, U.S. refineriesare running at about 95% of their true capacity, which isoften less than the officially stated capacity. Hence, hedoesn't view big refining operations as a drawback.   Mr. Maxwell likes the international oils such as Chevron,Mobil, Royal Dutch, British Petroleum and Texaco, with Exxon&quot;slightly behind.&quot; He reasons that it's too expensive to findsignificant amounts of new oil in the U.S. Oil consumption isgrowing fastest in the Far East and Europe, he says, whichshould benefit the internationals.   Mr. Maxwell also is fond of oil-service companies such asBaker Hughes, Schlumberger and Halliburton. However, hecautions that &quot;these companies have done so well, they arenow a little on the expensive side.&quot;   Mr. Smith of Bear Stearns gives a little edge to domesticproducers. &quot;Back in 1979, when oil was getting veryexpensive, there was frequently a domestic premium,&quot; herecalls. &quot;I'll give a couple of extra points for having it{oil} in a secure location.&quot;   His three favorites are Atlantic Richfield, Amoco andUnocal. He, too, favors producers with extensive natural-gasoperations and expects natural gas prices to catch up withoil. Freak weather last year is one reason gas pricescurrently lag, he said. The winter started with the coldestDecember in decades, then turned unusually mild, leaving manyusers stuck with oversupplies of gas.   Walter Kass, a New York money manager, says he's gettingready to take a flier on Devon Energy (traded on the AmericanStock Exchange). He likes it because it's &quot;all U.S., allexploration.&quot; He plans to buy convertible preferred stockrather than the common stock.   Mr. Kass already owns one unusual energy play -- MaritransPartners, a master limited partnership traded on the BigBoard. Maritrans transports oil with tugboats and barges (itsstock symbol is TUG). Though it recently had an oil spill inthe New York area, Mr. Kass says it responded quickly tominimize the damage.   Marine transportation of oil is likely to be a growtharea, he says, because environmental concerns mean &quot;you'renot going to see too many more pipelines built.&quot;   Of course, not everyone is on the bullish side of energystocks. In a report dated July 27, just before the Iraqiinvasion, Sanford C. Bernstein strategist David Eisenbergwrote that oil service stocks are &quot;20% overvalued&quot; and thatinvestors should &quot;gradually cash in your winnings here.&quot; Theenergy sector as a whole should be slightly underweighted,Mr. Eisenberg wrote. He couldn't be reached for commentFriday.   Also, some analysts are fretting about the outlook forcompanies that specialize in refining, since they will haveto pay more for oil to refine. For that reason, Dean WitterReynolds analyst Gene Nowak advised clients Thursday to avoidAshland Oil, Sun Co. and Mapco.   ---   Kuwait's rulers weren't the only royalty deposed by Iraq'sattack last week. By driving up oil stocks and punishing mostothers, the Mideast war also helped dethrone General Electricfrom the top of the stock market.   GE reigned for just a week as the U.S. company with thelargest market capitalization -- defined as stock price timesthe number of shares. It lost $2 billion of market value lastweek as the shares slid to 69 3/4 from 72. Its marketcapitalization fell to $61.98 billion from $63.98 billion.   International Business Machines, long the U.S. leader inmarket capitalization, also fell back to a marketcapitalization of $61.98 billion at Friday's closing price of108 1/8, down from $63.85 billion the week before.   The new leader? Exxon, whose shares rose 3 1/8 last weekto close at 53 1/8, adding $3.9 billion in market value for atotal of $66.3 billion.   ---   Tom Herman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
