In fact, as he was being sworn in here for his second five-year term as head of the union, Mr. Trumka showed a strengthened hand to the companies: He announced that the United Auto Workers union has extended a $50 million line of credit to the UMW's selective strike fund, which already had been approaching $100 million.    &quot;The next contract may come peacefully or it may come as a result of a struggle,&quot; said Mr. Trumka at the ceremonies. &quot;But either way, it will come.&quot; The union's current wage pact expires Feb. 1. Talks began Nov. 12.    Union sources said Mr. Trumka's tough talk and continued silence on details of negotiations more than likely means the holiday deadline won't be met. But they cautioned about reading too much into the date, suggesting that most of the important issues with the coal producers have been put on the bargaining table and, thus, the possibility of a sudden breakthrough shouldn't be ruled out.    Union sources explained that Mr. Trumka made mention of Christmas merely as a challenge to the industry, not as a promise to UMW workers. Still, it's clear that the hundreds of miners who gathered at the inauguration ceremonies -- held in the city where legendary UMW leader John L. Lewis was buried -- were looking for some word on the contract.    Should the talks in Washington break down, selective strikes are likely. Meanwhile many miners are deciding between putting extra money in the bank to prepare for a walkout or putting extra gifts under the tree for their families.    &quot;It's tough for a worker like me,&quot; said Tim Drea, who works not far from here in Peabody Coal Co.'s No. 10 mine. &quot;My savings could be wiped out by a strike.&quot;    But Mr. Trumka has given no hints that he will back down from his main goal of winning job security for his members in order to reach a swift accord. Yesterday, for instance, he continually characterized the companies in the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the industry's bargaining unit, as &quot;enemies&quot; and &quot;adversaries.&quot;    The union chief also disclosed that Old Ben Coal Co., the No. 14 producer, had signed a &quot;me, too&quot; pact with the UMW, whereby the company will accept whatever agreement is reached in Washington in return for a no-strike guarantee by the union. </TEXT></DOC>
