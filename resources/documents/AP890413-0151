In the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, scene of the Sundayconfrontation, an estimated 2,000 people marched through thestreets for the first funeral for one of the victims, psychiatristZia Djinjaradze, 42, according to a local human rights activist.   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported Georgian activistshave changed their tactics in the face of Soviet troops keepingorder in Tbilisi, and are handing out handwritten leaflets to pressfor a general strike.   The Georgian Communist Party's ruling Politburo met Thursday andsaid the situation remained ``strained,'' with universities andschools still shut by boycotts. It said factories and publictransport were operating normally.   The Tass news agency, in its report on the meeting, gave no wordon leadership changes. Local party chief Dzhumber I. Patiashvilioffered to resign Tuesday after accepting responsibility forSunday's events. Approval by the Georgian party's Central Committeewould be necessary to replace Patiashvili.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a newsbriefing in Moscow that a commission investigating charges ofbrutality in Tbilisi was probing whether soldiers who broke up theprotest by pro-independence forces were in possession of shortmetal shovels customarily used for digging trenches.   ``The troops were not supposed to have those spades,'' Gerasimovsaid.   If an investigation finds soldiers beat the protesters withshovels, ``there is a question of whether these people should bepunished or not,'' he said.   However, Gerasimov justified the decision to clear the square ofprotesters, saying, ``We should take into account the situationwhich evolved, since endless meetings lasted for five days and theyall but paralyzed the work of enterprises, and people alsoattempted to penetrate the territory of government institutions.''   Patiashvili said he did not expect fatalities when troops wereordered to break up the demonstration outside Tbilisi's GovernmentHouse because they were equipped only with nightsticks and shields.But several Georgians who spoke in telephone interviews said thesoldiers also were carrying shovels.   Sergei Dandurov, a human rights activist, said police and troopsmade no attempt to stop Ms. Djinjaradze's funeral cortege as itwound through streets near Tbilisi's university at 4 p.m.   ``They didn't create obstacles to the funeral,'' Dandurov said.He said some policemen even joined the marchers, whom he estimatednumbered 2,000.   At the site of the bloody confrontation, a spontaneous memorialhas appeared, piled with fresh flowers, said an editor atAkhalgarda Kommunisti, the Georgian Communist Party youth newspaper.   Pravda said pickets in Tbilisi were calling on workers tostrike. But Gerasimov said all enterprises were working, and thatonly the university and some schools remained disrupted by strikes.   The curfew remains in effect, and alcohol sales have beenrestricted, Gerasimov said. Foreign reporters have been barred fromtraveling to Tbilisi since unrest there began.   Red Star, the military daily, said groups of 15-20 activistswere passing out leaflets and spreading rumors in the city of 1.2million people 900 miles south of Moscow.   Some leaflets contain lists which claim to identify furthervictims of Sunday's clash beyond the 19 officially confirmed dead,said the Akhalgadra Kommunisti editor, who refused to give his name.   Activists also have been ripping down the announcements of themilitary command, according to Red Star. Dandurov said two statuesof Bolsheviks who helped establish Soviet power in the Caucasus _Sergei Kirov and Sergo Ordzhonikidze _ also were vandalized.   Tbilisi was shaken by a minor earthquake Thursday, shortly afternoon local time. Tass said the jolt measured only 5 on the 12-pointSoviet scale at the epicenter in the mountains 60 miles to theeast, and only 4 in the capital of the republic.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a Georgian who servedas the region's party chief from 1972 to 1985, was at the meetingof Georgian party leaders Thursday. He has canceled trips to EastGermany and West Germany because of the unrest.   On Wednesday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for calmin Georgia in a message read on local radio and television andcarried in the press. He rejected the demands of nationalists whoseek secession from the Soviet Union, and blamed them for ignitingthe strife he said was damaging his reform drive.   The trouble in Tbilisi started when protesters criticized callsfrom members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to breakaway because of alleged discrimination by Georgians.   Other protesters demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet Unionbecause of alleged interference from the central government andRussians in the republic's political, economic and cultural affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
