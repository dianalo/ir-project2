The price increases cover nearly 70% of the company's car lines, and a spokesman said the auto maker will announce prices on the remaining products in the next few months. The tentative prices are disclosed to help dealers take advance customer orders, but they often indicate final prices, which Ford is scheduled to announce shortly before Oct. 1, the start of the new model year.    Ford said that on a comparably-equipped basis, the increases were significantly lower than the 4%-to-6% range because of the equipment it has made standard on many new models. The auto maker's new-car pricing reflects an increasing industry trend of adding equipment and features on new models -- a strategy that helps auto makers boost profitability while justifying higher prices to customers.    The equipment and features Ford has made standard on various 1988 models include air conditioning, interval windshield wipers, tinted glass, digital clock and improved seats. Last month, Chrysler Corp. also announced tentative 1988 price increases, many in the 8%-to-12% range, and attributed them to standardized items that were optional last year. General Motors Corp., which normally sets the pricing pattern for the industry, also is understood to be following a similar strategy. GM hasn't yet announced 1988 prices.    The U.S. auto makers' price increases are puzzling many of their dealers. The companies are in the midst of widespread consumer incentive programs, which offer big cash rebates to low-interest financing. Also, car sales have weakened, and the sales outlook is less than sanguine in an uncertain economy. In addition, domestic auto makers face intensifying competition as output of Japanese plants now coming on stream increases next year.    Nonetheless, domestic auto makers are able to raise prices because Japanese auto makers, their main competitors, have done likewise. Since last year, the appreciating value of the yen against the dollar has prompted all Japanese auto makers to raise prices sharply, providing a pricing &quot;umbrella&quot; for the U.S. auto makers.    Industry analysts believe that the sharply higher prices this year also reflect the companies' hidden agenda of later offering bigger discounts than they are offering now in an effort to attract customers. They say that the companies increasingly will need bigger and bigger incentives to lure customers in the future, and the recent price increases would help the auto makers offer sweetened incentives without hurting their profit.    &quot;The companies will sell at the higher prices as long as they can, especially the way the Japanese have raised prices,&quot; said William Tonyes, a new-car sales manager in Bergenfield, N.J. &quot;When the market goes bad, they will be there with all kinds of incentives. They have inflated their prices enough to cover the programs,&quot; he said.    While Ford plans to leave the price of its cheapest Escort subcompact, the three-door GL model, unchanged at $6,949, it raised the price of Escort GL wagon more than 5% to $7,938 for the 1988 model. The 1987 and the 1988 Escort wagons have the same level of equipment, the Ford spokesman said.    The proposed price tag on the two-door Mustang LX rose 6% to $8,726; the list price on the four-door Taurus GL, which has an improved seat belt and different tires than on the predecessor model, rose 4.1% to $12,200.    Ford said it raised the price of the four-door GS Sable 14.6% to $14,145. It said the newest Sable model has air conditioning, a new type of rear seat belt, interval windshield wipers, digital clock, and different seats as standard equipment. Without the standard equipment, the price increase would amount to only 3.5%, Ford estimated. Ford raised the base price of the four-door Grand Marquis 6.3% to $16,612, but it said that on a comparably-equipped basis the increase was 2%.    Separately, Chrysler announced tentative prices for its all-new 1988 front-wheel-drive luxury cars. It set the price for the Chrysler New Yorker at $17,416 and the New Yorker Landau at $19,509, the Dodge Dynasty at $11,666 and the Dynasty Premium at $12,226. </TEXT></DOC>
