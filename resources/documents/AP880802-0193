They said 15-20 rockets had hit Kabul in the past week, killingat least 19 people, but the number was lower than for comparableperiods recently.   Diplomats said Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city,probably will be the next major troop withdrawal point as theSoviets try to meet the Aug. 15 deadline for pulling at least50,000 Red Army troops out of the country.   The Western sources quoted East European diplomats as saying theSoviets already had begun leaving Kandahar. The southern city,Afghanistan's ancient capital, is under siege by guerrillas.   An estimated 100,000-115,000 Red Army soldiers were inAfghanistan when the Soviets signed a U.N.-mediated agreement April14 to pull its forces out. The withdrawal began May 15, with halfto be gone by Aug. 15 and the rest by Feb. 15, 1989.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after acommunist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces were sentto the country in December 1979.   Diplomats said Soviet and Afghan troops, officers of the Khadsecret service and members of the presidential guard were trying todrive the insurgents away from Kabul.   They said the defenders moved into the besieged Paghman areanine miles west of Kabul late last week. The town of Paghman issaid to have been abandoned by its civilian population.   Other troop movements southwest and northwest of the city alsohave been reported, said the Western sources, all of whom spoke oncondition of anonymity. Some reports from diplomats and guerrillashave said Soviet soldiers were being brought in from northernAfghanistan.   Soviet officials say 35,000 soldiers have left Afghanistan sinceMay 15 and the diplomats say Kandahar will be the next city whosedefense will be turned over to government troops.   Estimates of the number of Soviet troops in Kandahar range from2,000 to 8,000.   Azim Nasser-Zia of the National Islamic Front, one of thestrongest guerrilla organizations in Kandahar, said about 6,000Soviet soldiers are in the area.   Guerrillas have operated in Kandahar since the war began, makingregular forays into the city, and most Soviet soldiers in Kandaharare at the heavily fortified airport.</TEXT></DOC>
