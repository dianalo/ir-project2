Hutton salesmen went to the Housing Authority of Fulton County, Ga., and urged it to sell $125 million in tax-exempt bonds for low-income housing.    The tax-overhaul bill in Congress was about to clamp down on such bonds, the salesmen said, and this was the last chance to cash in under the old rules. The transaction was sealed with an all-expenses-paid trip to New York and a plush dinner at Windows on the World.    Last month, the program collapsed. The bonds were redeemed without a single low-income housing unit ever being built. But E.F. Hutton, now part of Shearson Lehman Hutton, collected $1.4 million in fees, and Sumitomo Bank, which provided credit for the program, raked in more than $1 million. &quot;Hutton sold us a can of worms,&quot; says Sherman Golden, a former member of the housing authority.    Fulton County isn't the only place stuck with worms. In recent months, dozens of similar projects financed by bond issues floated in the rush before the 1986 Tax Reform Act have collapsed, with the money unspent. A government official says such &quot;build-nothing&quot; bonds could total $50 billion or more.    Moreover, the taxpayer has had to pick up a multibillion-dollar tab for the bonds. As tax-exempts, intended to finance public projects, the bonds paid relatively low rates, but the proceeds from selling them could be reinvested at higher rates and earn huge arbitrage profits. The result: investment bankers, banks, bond lawyers and local governments made billions from taxpayer-subsidized projects that were never built.    Whether it was legal to tap the taxpayer this way is murky. Pre-1986 tax law required bond issuers to have &quot;reasonable expectations&quot; that the money would actually be used as intended. That's a difficult point to prove. In Fulton County, Mr. Golden argues that E.F. Hutton designed its program not to build housing but to earn arbitrage profits. For instance, there was little incentive for developers to participate in the program, he says, because they wouldn't own the projects themselves.    Attorney Raymond Sales of Chapman andamp; Cutler in Atlanta, who reviewed the program in 1986, says he &quot;didn't see why any developer would take so much risk for so little reward.&quot; Mr. Golden raised such concerns when the bond issue was being considered in 1986 but ultimately signed off on the sale.    Steven McCoy, the Hutton vice president who sold the housing authority on the program, insists there was nothing wrong with its design. He blames a weak real-estate market for the program's failure. &quot;The real estate market deteriorated throughout the three-year period,&quot; Mr. McCoy says. &quot;Existing projects suffered, and it was not prudent to finance new projects.&quot;    Whether or not the expectations were &quot;reasonable,&quot; only about $1.6 million has been used from $1 billion of similar housing bonds Hutton underwrote for other agencies in Atlanta and elsewhere.    To date, the Internal Revenue Service has done little to deal with the epidemic of build-nothing bonds. That's partly because of a practical problem: If the IRS declares that the bonds aren't tax-exempt, then it must collect money from the thousands of investors who unwittingly bought them. &quot;The sanction is out of proportion to the crime,&quot; says an IRS official. &quot;You hammer the wrong people.&quot;    Instead, the IRS has in a few cases attempted to recover some of the arbitrage profits by negotiating settlements with the bond issuers. Such accords have recovered some $80 million since 1982, much of it coming from abuses that occurred before the 1986 tax law was passed. Current efforts focus on the most egregious violations, such as bonds underwritten by the Wall Street firm of Matthews andamp; Wright Group Inc., which was charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Matthews andamp; Wright settled with the SEC, turning in its broker-dealer license while neither admitting nor denying the charges.    IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg says his agency is stepping up its enforcement efforts against the build-nothing bonds. The IRS held a bond training program for tax examiners earlier this year and has targeted 50 bond issues, totaling $3.6 billion, for closer investigation. &quot;People are likely to go to jail, and municipalities will have to disgorge large amounts of money,&quot; Mr. Goldberg says.    But even the $3.6 billion targeted by the tax-collection agency may be only a small part of the total. Nearly every firm on Wall Street seems to have been involved in issues of build-nothing bonds. Democratic Rep. Brian Donnelly of Massachusetts has written Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady saying he is &quot;appalled and outraged&quot; by the extent of the problem. Rep. Donnelly calls on the Treasury to &quot;aggressively investigate the potential for fraud&quot; in such deals.    Some people even blame IRS inaction for encouraging the epidemic of build-nothing bonds. The more aggressive securities firms &quot;put a foot over the chalk line and looked around, and nobody said anything,&quot; says Austin Koenen, vice chairman of the Public Securities Association, &quot;so everyone else moved over the line.&quot;    Even Commissioner Goldberg acknowledges that the IRS needs to get tough with the bad bonds. &quot;We damn well better follow up, and my expectation is that we will,&quot; he says. &quot;If we don't deal with this, we'll lose our credibility.&quot;    Jeffrey Esser, executive director of the Government Finance Officers Association, says blame also has to be shared by congressional tax writers who wrote the laws, the local governments that issued the bonds, and especially the Wall Street &quot;salesmen who hustled communities and scared them&quot; into rushing bonds to market. &quot;There's lots of blame to be passed around,&quot; he says.    Build-nothing bonds were sold nationwide for a variety of purposes, ranging from ski slopes to solid waste disposal plants to &quot;pool&quot; programs, where a town or agency borrowed money to lend to other jurisdictions for capital improvements and the like. Many of them were rushed to market before three key dates in the 1984-86 period, when tax rules were slated to change. In many cases, the bonds were structured so that they could be redeemed in three years if the money wasn't used.    A small sampling of the failed bond issues:    --The Texas Small Business Industrial Development Corp. issued $750 million in bonds, underwritten by Shearson Lehman, to raise a pool of money for financing development. Only two loans totaling $25 million were ever made; most of the rest of the bonds were redeemed this summer, after earning enough arbitrage profits to pay $14.7 million in costs.    --Woodridge, Ill., sold $585 million of &quot;pooled loan&quot; bonds, underwritten by First Boston Corp., to make loans to other Illinois towns for capital projects and equipment purchases. A partial, $250 million remarketing was led by John Nuveen andamp; Co. No loans were made, and all the bonds were redeemed this summer. A bond lawyer who is involved said the SEC has made inquiries but insisted no investigation is in progress. The SEC had no comment.    --An Irwindale, Calif., authority sold $395 million in bonds in late 1984 for a solid waste recovery plant. The project wasn't built, and the bonds, underwritten by Ehrlich Bober andamp; Co., were redeemed -- but not before earning $18 million in arbitrage profits, according to a Los Angeles County grand jury report.    --Industrial development authorities in three small Arizona towns sold $368.4 million of multifamily housing bonds in early 1985. This spring, the IRS said the bonds, underwritten by Birr Wilson andamp; Co., shouldn't be tax exempt because the projects weren't realistic in the first place. The money raised by the bonds earned $20 million in arbitrage profits.    --The Kings River Conservation District in California sold $450 million of bonds in late 1985 after being told that it couldn't sell the bonds on a tax-exempt basis after 1985, according to Jeff Taylor, district general manager. The bonds were redeemed without funding the project. First Boston was the lead underwriter.    In a few cases, such as a collapsed $88 million issue underwritten by PaineWebber for Collier County, Fla., the project underwriters had to forfeit their fees. But in most, the fees were paid out of arbitrage profits earned from reinvesting the money.    If any of the arbitrage profits were left over, they generally went to the issuer. Gregory Artis, who became chairman of the Housing Authority of Fulton County after the bonds were sold, says his authority's leftover arbitrage profits will come to a thin $141,000 -- a small part of the $1.4 million earned by Hutton. Asked if Hutton misled the housing authority, Mr. Artis responds: &quot;I don't believe so.&quot; @ --- @ Build-Nothing Bonds @ Here are some of the many tax-exempt bond issues from 1984-1986 that have been redeemed, without building anything: @ STATED AMOUNT @ ISSUER PURPOSE (In millions) UNDERWRITER @ Los Angeles Incinerator $235.0 Smith Barney @ Woodridge, Ill.
