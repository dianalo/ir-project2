Students yelled ``Yankee go home!'' and tried to stage apeaceful sit-down protest at U.S. 8th Army headquarters in southernSeoul, but hundreds of riot officers forced them into police buses.   At the National Assembly, officials said the legislators wereready to accept a request from communist North Korea for talks on anon-aggression pact and the North's possible participation in theOlympic Games in September. The war began in 1950 when the Northinvaded South Korea.   About 2,000 radical students and dissidents rallied later in theday at Korea University, then half the crowd marched to the U.S.Embassy.   Thousands of riot police followed the march, blocked the wayless than a mile from the embassy and persuaded the protesters tomove into a nearby park, where they dispersed voluntarily.   ``Down with the United States, which forced partition of theKorean peninsula!'' protesters shouted, demanding the withdrawal of42,000 American soldiers based here under a defense treaty.   The United States and 15 other nations intervened on SouthKorea's side during the war and China supported North Korea. Thewar ended in a stalemate and armistice July 27, 1953, but the twoKoreas remain technically at war because no treaty has been signed.   Radical students say the United States is responsible for thepeninsula's continued division and claim it treats the South as acolony. They have called for immediate reunification, but havelittle public support.   Assembly officials said representatives of the top fourpolitical parties and Speaker Kim Chae-sun agreed to accept theNorth Korean offer and the agreement would be conveyed toPyongyang, North Korea's capital, on Aug. 1 after party leadersgive formal approval.   Lawmakers added, however, that they want preliminary talks atthe Panmunjom border truce village to work out preliminary detailsfor negotiations. They recommended a meeting in the second week ofAugust.   ``The South is ready to take up the Olympic issue and does notwant to limit the agenda,'' one aide said.   North Korea has indicated it does not want preliminary talks.South Korean media reports earlier this week said North Koreaconsidered them a waste of time.   The North Koreans sent a proposal to the South last week callingfor talks between their legislatures on a non-aggression pact andsuggested the first round be held in Pyongyang.   In a second letter Tuesday, the North said it also was ready todiscuss entering the Olympics in Seoul on condition its demand tobe co-host was discussed.   South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have refusedto let the North be co-host because the Games are awarded to asingle city. The North has said it will boycott the Games.   Three previous rounds of talks on easing tension andestablishing relations ended in failure. The North ended the mostrecent series in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
