Aside from proving shuttles can fly again, deploying theTracking and Data Relay Satellite is Discovery's main mission. Oneis already in orbit, but a nearly identical one was destroyed inthe Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.   The satellite, once it reaches it final orbit of 22,300 miles,will help ground controllers monitor shuttles and unmannedspacecraft. Coverage provided by the satellite is more continuousthan the space agency's worldwide network of ground-basedcommunications tracking systems.   Deploying the satellite is important to NASA because the one inorbit has had minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percentcapacity, said Jim Elliott, a spokesman at the agency's GoddardSpace Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. That satellite can monitorshuttles about 45 percent of each orbit.   A satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft oranother satellite and a ground terminal at White Sands MissileRange, N.M., which then routes it to the appropriate NASA facility.   The deployment is scheduled to begin about six hours afterliftoff, although there were five later times it could be done ifneeded.   A spring-loaded ejection device first pushes the satellite andan Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket from Discovery's cargo bay,and the satellite waltzes away at 2.7 mph.   About an hour later, the rocket's first stage fires. The secondstage ignites 12{ hours after launch and puts the satellite in itsfinal orbit.   The satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboarda shuttle, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officialssaid. The satellite itself weighs about 5,000 pounds and it has two50-pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas.   The satellite will be placed in orbit over the Pacific Oceannear the Gilbert Islands. Its orbit keeps it always hovering overthe same part of the Earth.   On Tuesday, NASA had a brief scare when a booster rocket beingreadied for a shuttle flight next February was found to have adamaged seal.   There was concern that the booster rocket aboard Discovery mighthave the same flaw, but engineers worked overnight and determinedfrom tests that even with such a defect, the seal would performproperly.</TEXT></DOC>
