Thedata are well described by the negative binomial distribution. The parametersof these distributions for the {pi}/sup +/p and pp and are differentfor full phase space, but similar for the central region. In the centralregion, the relation k/sub ch/ {similar_to}1/2k/sub -/ holds for allcharged and negative multiplicities. This favours to the interpretationin terms of cascade models rather than stimulated emission models. 12refs.; 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
