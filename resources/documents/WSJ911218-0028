The change reflects a significant slowdown in rural growthduring the 1980s, and also a small increase in the rate ofurban growth during that decade. The nation's ruralpopulation grew a mere 4% during the 1980s, following a brisk11% rise in the 1970s. The urban population, which includespeople in cities and surrounding suburbs, grew 12% in the1980s after increasing 11.6% in the 1970s.</LP><TEXT>   Census Bureau demographer Larry Long said changingrelocation practices of U.S. companies may help explain theslowdown in rural population growth during the 1980s. Manycompanies moved plants from urban to rural areas during the1970s in an attempt to reduce labor costs, but after therecession of the early 1980s, such companies were more likelyto relocate plants overseas, he explained.   Urban dwellers totaled 187 million in 1990, or 75% of thetotal population, up from the 1980 tally of 167 million, or74% of the population, according to the Census Bureau. To agreat extent, this growth reflects a rising number ofimmigrants, especially Hispanics and Asians. Immigrants aremuch more likely than other groups to live in urban areas.   In two states, North Carolina and North Dakota,populations that previously were predominantly rural becamemajority urban during the 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
