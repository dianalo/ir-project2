Fixed-rate Eurodollar issues closed down 1/8 to 1/4 point in what some traders characterized as nervous trading.    &quot;The New York markets have been going up and down most of the day,&quot; said a secondary issues specialist at a large U.S. investment house. &quot;Everyone is waiting for some real direction.&quot;    That nervousness didn't stop borrowers from pushing back into the markets in several currencies, however.    Bank of Tokyo Ltd. found strong demand for its $100 million of 15-year convertible Eurobonds, indicating a 2% coupon at par. The bonds were quoted at 108 to 109, an indication that they were priced &quot;too generously,&quot; according to a syndications official at a U.S. bank.    An official at Bank of Tokyo International Ltd., which led the issue, said the terms were designed to &quot;ensure the success&quot; of the issue but &quot;weren't overly generous.&quot;    McDonald's Corp. issued $75 million (Canadian) of 8 1/2% Eurobonds due May 14, 1992, at 101 5/8 to yield 8.09%, via Morgan Guaranty Ltd.    Caisse Nationale des Telecommunications, the French telecommunications industry lender, entered a mixed Euroyen market successfully with $137.2 million of 4 3/8% five-year Eurobonds through IBJ International Ltd.    In other Eurobond launchings, GMAC (Australia) Finance Ltd. demonstrated that there still is demand for paper denominated in Australian dollars, even though there has been a large number of such issues this year.    GMAC issued the equivalent of $35.3 million (U.S.) of 14 1/4%, four-year Eurobonds, via Hambros Bank Ltd.    Thomas Candy, a Hambros director, said there has been particularly strong demand for Australian dollar issues from German investors, who are attracted by their relatively high yields of nearly 14%. The GMAC issue, for example, yields 13.91%.    Long British government bond prices were down 3/4 point on bearish sentiment following rises in prime lending rates of some major U.S. banks.    &quot;The action of the U.S. banks was a general surprise,&quot; one gilts economist said yesterday. &quot;It accounts for the bearish tone in the market today. Initially, the market was expected to do better.&quot;    The boost in U.S. prime lending rates is the first since mid-1984 and was surprising because prime lending rates usually follow Federal Reserve discount rate moves.    Economists here see the rate boost as a clear indication that rates will rise if the dollar continues to fall.    They also view the boost as one means of helping to narrow the U.S. trade deficit, as neither the West German nor the Japanese economies appear ready to expand and absorb more U.S. exports. </TEXT></DOC>
