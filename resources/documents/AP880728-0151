Another acquaintance of Mohammed Hamadi testified that thedefendant was ``crazy about Khomeini'' (Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, Iran's revolutionary patriarch), and a third said Hamadiadmitted belonging to Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian radical ShiiteMoslem group linked to kidnappings in Lebanon.   Mohammed Hamadi is accused of being one of the hijackers of TWAflight 847, which was seized on June 14, 1985 and diverted toBeirut, Lebanon. The gunmen killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethemand held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days.   A West German court convicted Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, inApril of kidnapping two West Germans in Beirut in an attempt toforce West Germany to free Mohammed.   Gaazi Yazbeck, a Lebanese man who lives in West Germany andknows the two Hamadis, was asked in court if Mohammed Hamadi evermentioned the hijacking to him.   ``No, Mohammed said nothing. But his brother, Abbas, saidMohammed had something to do with the hijacking,'' Yazbeck replied.``He just said it, he was sort of bragging.''   Yazbeck said the conversation occurred ``a few weeks after theairplane was hijacked'' at a bar in Saarland state, where AbbasHamadi was then living.   Another witness, Elfriede Akcura, said she befriended MohammedHamadi while he lived in West Germany from 1982-1984 and theyfrequently discussed religion.   ``He was crazy about Khomeini,'' she said. ``He is a Khomeinifollower.''   Witness Reinhard Schmid, who shared a cell with Hamadi for sixmonths in 1987, said that at one point Hamadi admitted to being amember of Hezbollah.   Schmid, who was in prison for a drug offense but is now free,said he asked Hamadi what Hezbollah's goals were and quoted Hamadias replying, ``The goal of the Hezbollah is to wipe out theZionists even if it takes generations.''   He said Hamadi told him Hezbollah's enemies were Israel,``France and those supported by the Americans.''   Schmid told the court that during their conversations Hamadiinsisted he had nothing to do with the hijacking.   But he said Hamadi also told him ``he was willing to confess toanything if his boss in Lebanon told him to, including that he wasin the airplane and shot at Stethem, regardless of theconsequences.''   Schmid said that after former hostages viewed Hamadi in a lineupand said they recognized him, Hamadi told him: ``I don't know howthey can recognize me, because I had nothing to do with it.''   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,1987, after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in hisluggage.   Two West Germans, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt, werekidnapped shortly after in Beirut.   Abbas Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport after returningfrom Lebanon on Jan. 26, 1987, and was charged with the abductions.   The kidnappers freed Schmidt in September. Cordes remains ahostage.</TEXT></DOC>
