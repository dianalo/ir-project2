Otherthan those discussed in PART 5 below, the changes are generally editorialin nature, and do not affect the character or use of information containedin the system but rather (a) reflect changes to systems locations and managersdue to Postal Service reorganization; (b) improve (but do not expand) thedescription of categories of individuals covered and the types of recordscontained in the system, and the purpose for which the system is maintained,by adding additional examples or explanations (see USPS 030.010, 030.030,070.010, 100.010, 120.020, 120.035, 120.040, 120.100, 120.151, 120.152,120.153, 120.170, 120.220, 120.230, 140.020, 150.010, 150.020, 160.030,190.030, 200.010, 200.020, 210.020, and 210.030); and (c) change retentionand disposal schedules. In addition, advance notice of changes to USPS 010.010, Collection andDelivery Records_Address Change and Mail Forwarding Records was publishedat 5 FR 19641, May 30, 1986. Final notice of the adoption of those changeswas inadvertently not published and is given now.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 5. Advance Notice of New and Altered Systems </ITAG>Reports of new and altered systems (except for those not required to bereported that are identified in paragraphs B.2.a. and B.2.b. below), asrequired by 5 U.S.C. 552a(o), have been submitted to OMB and Congress,pursuant to paragraph 4b of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, ``FederalAgency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals,'' datedDecember 12, 1985. <ITAG tagnum="84">A. New Systems </ITAG><T3>USPS 060.030, Consumer Protection Records_Appeals Involving Mail Withheldfrom Delivery </T3>collects records relating to appeals of decisions bythe Postal Service to withhold mail from delivery. Use of the mail in furtheranceof a lottery or in furtherance of a scheme to defraud are unlawful mailingactivities, prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 1302 and 1341, respectively. Upon evidencesatisfactory to the Postal Service of a potential violation pursuant tothese statutes, the Postal Service may issue an order to withhold mailfrom delivery (39 U.S.C. 3003). The maintenance of records within this system and system USPS 060.040 discussedbelow is not new, but was considered to be covered under generally wordedexisting record systems. This notice amends these ``umbrella'' record systemdescriptions and adds new ones to cover records relating to the specificproceedings in which Postal Service legal counsel represents the PostalService and to make clear to the public the nature of those records. <T3>USPS 060.040, Consumer Protection Records_Appeals from Terminationof Post Office Box or Caller Service </T3>collects records relating toappeals of decisions by the Postal Service to terminate post office boxor caller service. A postmaster may deny or terminate such service whenthe caller has falsified the application for service or violated a regulationor condition relating to the use of that service. The applicant or callermay appeal the decision of the postmaster which will transfer the caseto the Judicial Officer Department. Records within this system are maintainedby the Law Department's Consumer Protection Division whose attorneys representthe Postal Service in administrative proceedings before the Judicial OfficerDepartment. <T3>USPS 120.061, Personnel Records_Public Financial Disclosure Reportsfor Executive Branch Personnel </T3>collects Financial Disclosure Reportsfor senior level employees as defined in the ``categories of records''segment of that system description (see PART 5). The purpose of this systemof records is to meet the public financial reporting requirements imposedby the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-521, amended) on highlevel executive personnel. The reports serve to deter conflicts of interestand to identify potential conflicts of interest by providing for a systematicdisclosure and review of the financial interests of both current and prospectiveofficers and employees. We do not anticipate that this system will have an adverse effect on theprivacy or other personal rights of individuals, since the Financial DisclosureReports themselves are publicly available pursuant to section 205 of theEthics in Government Act and implementing Postal Service regulations at39 CFR 442.42(e)(2). <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Altered Systems </ITAG>1. Changes in system purpose, categories of records, and categories ofindividuals a. <T3>USPS 010.080 </T3>was established to cover records used by the PostalService to evaluate and administer rural route delivery. Use of those recordswill be expanded to assist government planning authorities in convertingrural addresses to locatable (city-style) street addresses. Assignmentof locatable street addresses facilitates the 911 emergency service programas well as postal delivery.The government planning authority will give to the Postal Service a mapshowing a street name and number assigned to each developed lot withinthe territory involved. The Postal Service will then produce a list whichcross-references existing rural route and box number with each new city-styleaddress assigned by the government planning authority. Address conversioninformation will be consolidated into a centralized database known as theLocatable Address Conversion System (LACS) which will be used to providean address list correction service to mailers. LACS is separate and distinctfrom the National Change of Address File (NCOA) covered by USPS 010.010and described at 51 FR 19639 (May 30, 1986). However, the same firms underlicense agreement with the Postal Service to update mailer's lists usingthe NCOA file will update mailer's lists using LACS. The Postal Servicewill cause the licensee to maintain LACS in accordance with the relevantprovisions of the Privacy Act and will take the measures described at 51FR 19640 to minimize risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of LACS information.Disclosure to the government planning authority is limited to that necessaryto assign a locatable street address to each rural route address. Mailinglist correction service is limited to providing the new locatable (city-styleaddress) that corresponds to a rural route address on the mailing list.The mailer must provide a complete valid rural address to receive the newaddress for that site. The Postal Service will not verify that a namedcustomer receives mail at a given address nor will it provide missing customernames or correct listed ones. b. <T3>USPS 060.010 and USPS 060.020 </T3>are systems maintained by the ConsumerProtection Division in connection with its responsibility to representthe Postal Service in matters concerning use of the mails in violationof false representation and postal pandering and sexual oriented advertisementstatutes. The general wording in each of these systems is changed to clearlyreflect the subject area. c. <T3>USPS 110.020 </T3>maintains records concerning Postal Service intellectualproperties. Originally established to cover possible infringers of PostalService copyrights and trademarks, it is now expanded to include recordsrelating to patents and inventions and protective legal proceedings. d. <T3>USPS 120.060 </T3>collects records maintained to meet the requirementsof Executive Order 11222 on the filing of employment and financial intereststatements. The ``Purpose'' statement has been modified to provide a moredetailed explanation of the purposes served by the records. In addition,the ``categories of individuals'' section of the notice has been expandedto include members of the Postal Service Board of Governors. e. <T3>USPS 120.090, </T3>the medical record system, is expanded to coverrecords generated under a health program promoted by the new CorporateHealth Fitness Center now in operation at Postal Service Headquarters.Participation is voluntary and is intended to have no career implicationssince records generated as a result of employee participation are withinthe exclusive custody of the contractor operating the Center and are notaccessible to Postal Service management. Information needed by postal managementto assess program participation and effectiveness will be limited to aggregatedata, without personal identifiers. Contract stipulations require the contractorto maintain the records system in accordance with Privacy Act protections.Under these circumstances, maintenance of the records should have no unfavorableeffect on the privacy rights of the record subjects. f. <T3>USPS 120.110</T3>_In the system of preemployment investigation records,the ``categories of records'' is expanded to include records related tothe drug screening of applicants being considered for postal employment.Such screening is consistent with agency policy that persons who use drugson a current or habitual basis are not suitable for postal employment.Applicants are given advance notification of the testing requirement whichis part of the non-medical suitability review. Program procedures providemaximum protection to the privacy rights of those tested. Specimens arecollected by medical personnel who (1) assign unique bar codes to the specimens,(2) transport them to a laboratory under contract with the Postal Service,and (3) receive and maintain laboratory reports containing the results.The identities of those tested are not disclosed to the testing laboratoryand hiring officials receive only the medical officer's determination asto whether the tested applicant is qualified or not qualified for employmentconsideration. g. <T3>USPS 120.120 and USPS 120.121</T3>_As indicated by its title, USPS120.120 was established to maintain personnel research data as well astest data; however, the system description focussed on test data. Consequently,the wording is expanded to include records that support research performedfor personnel assessment and selection purposes. Because those recordswill not be used to make personnel decisions about a particular individualand related reports will contain only summary data without personal identifiers,the possibility of an adverse impact on a record subject's rights is minimal.Information within this system may also become part of USPS 120.121, establishedfor the related purpose of providing the Postal Service with the abilityto assess the impact of personnel selection decisions. h. <T3>USPS 120.140</T3>_This system was established to maintain records concerningemployees referred to PAR (Program for Alcoholic Recovery). The descriptionof USPS 120.140 is supplemented to cover records under the expanded PAR(now Employee Assistance Program (EAP)) about employees counseled for drugabuse and about applicants for counselor positions and employee counselors.i. <T3>USPS 120.240 and 200.020</T3>_These systems are modified to reflectcurrent processing of garnishments and personal property loss claims byfinance offices and personnel offices, respectively, rather than by theLaw Department. The legal document descriptions in the ``Categories ofRecords'' sections of these notices have been modified to reflect the maintenanceof records kept in the administrative processing of garnishment actionsand property loss claims, respectively.j. <T3>USPS 150.015 and 150.025</T3>_These systems were originally establishedto cover records relating to administrative appeals under the Freedom ofInformation Act or the Privacy Act, respectively. Litigation resultingfrom denials of those appeals were considered to be covered by existingsystem 190.010, established to cover miscellaneous types of litigationnot described in other systems. The ``categories of records'' sectionsof USPS 150.015 and 150.025 are revised to include records relating tolitigation resulting from the appeal cases already covered by these systems.k. <T3>USPS 190.010</T3>_This system was established to cover litigation recordsrelating to miscellaneous subjects. The character of this system remainsthe same except that litigation records specifically relating to subjectareas covered by other systems (see USPS 150.015 and 150.025 above) havebeen made a part of those systems and are no longer within the coverageof 190.010. l. <T3>USPS 200.030</T3>_This system contains records related to tort claimsand to litigation arising out of tort claims. Collection of these recordswas necessary in order for the Postal Service to defend itself againstsuch claims. That purpose has now been expanded to include use of recordsincident to the litigation for accident prevention and safety program managementand for providing related information to equipment manufacturers, suppliers,and their insurers. 2. Change in Equipment Configuration or Storage a. USPS 080.020, 080.030, 110.010, 110.020, 120.060, 140.020, 150.010,150.015, 150.020, 150.025 and 200.030_Records within these systems arenow maintained in automated as well as paper form. However, the automatedrecords are secured and accessible only by personnel who have access tothe same information in paper form. The automated records are kept in securedareas with access further restricted by computer password or keylock. Thesecircumstances will not result in greater access that might threaten theprivacy rights of the record subjects. b. USPS 040.020, 070.040, 100.020, 120.070, 120.120, 120.121 and 200.020_The``system location'' for these system notices is expanded to include thePostal Service's National Information Systems Development Center and/orPostal Data Center. These Centers are automated accounting, disbursing,and data processing facilities that provide computer support for postalactivities. The entire facility is secured and strict ADP controls arefurther applied to computer storage within the facility. The Center merelyperforms ADP services for the System Manager who maintains Privacy Actresponsibility. Maintenance of information by these centers for supportfunctions poses no threat to the privacy rights of record subjects. c. USPS 120.090_Only Corporate Health Fitness Center records newly maintainedwithin this system will be automated and those will be under the exclusivecontrol of the contractor operating the Center under contract provisionsrequiring protection of the information (see explanation at B.1. of Part5 above). d. USPS 120.130_The ``System Location'' is amended to designate maintenanceof records by postal facilities at two levels below those now mentioned.This is due to a change in the postmaster selection program. These facilitiesmaintain many employment-related Privacy Act records systems and theirmanagers are well aware of the protections that must be applied to suchrecords. e. USPS 160.030_The ``System Location'' and ``Storage'' sections have beenmodified to add the name of a postal facility and computer-readable media,respectively. These changes do not reflect a change in procedures or expandaccess beyond those persons having an official need for access. Althoughthe systems notice, as established, stated that these records are maintainedat a Postal Data Center (a Postal Service data processing facility describedin paragraph B.2.b. above), it erroneously did not reflect automated storage.That correction has been made. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 6. Complete Text of the Postal Service's Systems of Records.</ITAG>This Part contains the complete text of the Postal Service's systems ofrecords with the proposed changes and new routine uses set out in italics.Other system changes will be published upon completion of on-going projectsthat include scheduling for retention all Postal Service records and transferof certain records from paper to automated media. The following comments apply to the operation of these systems: a. Most systems containing contract records, as well as other legal recordsrelating to those contracts, are considered business records by the PostalService, rather than systems of records about ``individuals'', as thatterm is defined in the Privacy Act. b. All Postal Service records described in this list are subject to: 1. Disclosure pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.2. Review by Congress or one of its committees or subcommittees upon request.3. The ``purpose'' portion of each system notice is included to provideclarity and promote understanding of the system by the layman. It may bedefined as that activity performed by those officers and employees of thePostal Service who have a need for component records of the system in theperformance of their duties. Disclosure accounting is not maintained bythe Postal Service for any activity listed as a ``purpose.'' c. Records or information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civilaction or proceeding are exempt from individual access pursuant to 5 U.S.C.552a(d)(5). d. The USPS has claimed exemptions from certain provisions of the Act forseveral systems of records as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k). See39 CFR 266.9. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those systemsare incorporated into a non-exempt system, the exemptions applicable tothe original primary system shall continue to apply to the incorporatedrecords. e. Although paragraphs c. and d. of this Part are applicable to all PostalService systems of records, we have added these provisions to the descriptionsof those systems that are most likely to contain the described exempt material.Following is the complete text of the Postal Service's Privacy Act systemsof records: <ITAG tagnum="6">Fred Eggleston, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant General Counsel Legislative Division.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">USPS 010.010</ITAG>SYSTEM NAME:Collection and Delivery Records_Address Change and Mail Forwarding Records,010.010.SYSTEM LOCATION:Post Offices <T3>and contractor/licensee sites.</T3>CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:Postal customers requesting mail forwarding services from their local postalfacilities and any postal customers who are victims of a disaster who haverequested mail forwarding services through the Red Cross.CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:Records contain customer name, old address, new mailing address, mail forwardinginstructions, effective date, information as to whether the move is permanentor temporary and the customer's signature.AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:39 U.S.C. 403, 404.PURPOSE(S):<T3>(1) To provide mail forwarding services to postal customers who havechanged address;</T3><T3>(2) To provide address correction services to postal customers; and</T3><T3>(3) To provide address information to the Red Cross about a postalcustomer who has been relocated because of a disaster.</T3>ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIESOF USERS AND THE PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:<T3>Records within the system reflect a customer's temporary or permanentchange of address.
