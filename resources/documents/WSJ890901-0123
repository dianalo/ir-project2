The move demonstrates how much progress Pandamp;G, based here, has made in Japan, and its intentions to expand further. In fiscal 1989, Pandamp;G sales in that country grew 40% to $1.1 billion.    &quot;An Randamp;D center will reinforce Pandamp;G's commitment in the Far East,&quot; said Jay Freedman, analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. Sales of the consumer product giant's diapers, detergents and other products in Asia have been growing at about 30% annually for the last several years.    The decision to build the complex recognizes &quot;how important this market is for us,&quot; a Pandamp;G spokesman said. Indeed, sales growth in Japan has helped Pandamp;G's overall international market grow 22.3% to $8.56 billion from $7 billion a year ago. Overseas sales now represent 40% of the company's sales, and will reach 50% within five years, the company estimates.    That success comes after a series of early missteps. Pandamp;G first entered Japan in 1972, hoping to snare a share of the lucrative diaper and detergent business. But a decade later, the company piled up $200 million in losses, mostly due to marketing blunders caused by a lack of understanding of cultural differences.    For example, an ad for Camay soap that depicted a Japanese woman bathing when her husband walks into the bathroom was considered rude, and flopped. And U.S. versions of Pampers marketed in Japan were rejected by consumers as too bulky.    Now, Pandamp;G hires native Japanese to work in marketing and other areas and develops products specifically for the region. That strategy will be reinforced by the new research center.    Scheduled to open by December 1992, the center will cost between $140 million and $200 million. It will provide basic research as well as product and packaging development support for both Japan and the Asia Pacific region, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
