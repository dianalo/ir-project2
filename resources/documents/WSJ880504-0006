The verdict, after a seven-week trial in federal court here, comes amid the government's effort to convict more bankers accused of enriching themselves at the expense of their banks. Prosecutors nationwide have been inundated with big bank fraud cases in recent years, and despite assigning more prosecutors and investigators, the government has fallen badly behind.    The Continental case is perhaps the biggest bank fraud trial ever. John R. Lytle, a former Continental vice president who oversaw the disastrous purchase of more than $1 billion in loans from Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, was accused of improperly buying the loans in return for a $585,000 kickback. The loans resulted in losses to Continental of more than $800 million and were the single largest factor in its 1984 collapse, which led to a record $4.5 billion federal bailout.    Also charged were former Penn Square energy lending chief William Patterson, who originally made many of the loans, and oil man Jere A. Sturgis, who was accused of helping to funnel the alleged kickback to Mr. Lytle.    After nearly a week of deliberations, the jury acquitted Mr. Sturgis on all counts and couldn't reach a verdict on Messrs. Lytle and Patterson. U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas said he won't decide for several days whether to attempt to retry the two bankers.    Going into the trial, which came seven to eight years after many of the loans were made, prosecutors knew their chances of winning convictions weren't good. &quot;This was a very difficult and complex case,&quot; Mr. Valukas said after the verdict. The jury &quot;had the evidence presented by the best trial lawyers in this office.&quot;    All three defendants had denied any wrongdoing, and Mr. Lytle's attorneys contended he was just following orders of Continental's top executives, who targeted oil and gas lending as part of a highly aggressive loan-growth program.    Mr. Lytle was the only Continental official accused of criminal conduct in the banking concern's collapse; top executives, without admitting any wrongdoing, in 1986 settled civil charges of failing to properly disclose the bank's problems and of imprudent banking practices.    Mr. Patterson was acquitted in 1984 on related criminal charges arising out of Penn Square's 1982 failure.    Prosecutors in the Continental case had the difficult job of not only proving the alleged kickback scheme, but of proving that the loans, made during an oil boom, were improper at the time and not merely victims of the bust that soon followed.    Mr. Lytle and the two other men were originally indicted in 1984, but a series of pretrial problems, including a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on mail fraud that forced prosecutors to redraft parts of the indictments, delayed the case.    Federal prosecutors in Texas, California and Florida are particularly burdened with bank fraud investigations, many targeting savings and loans that failed after speculative lending binges. Some congressman have accused the Justice Department of reacting too slowly to the bank fraud epidemic. </TEXT></DOC>
