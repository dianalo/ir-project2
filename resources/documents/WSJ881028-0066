If it weren't for his commercials and sound bites, this campaign would have no issues at all.    We've heard, of course, that George Bush and Roger Ailes have run an unprecedentedly &quot;negative campaign.&quot; The Beltway media are singing this chorus because the election is not turning on what they regard as the issues -- the deficit, how much to raise taxes, how much to cut the defense budget. Mr. Ailes bet on a different set of issues -- patriotism, lower taxes, crime. The results November 8 will show who was right about what the voters see as issues.    The Democratic Convention nominated Michael Dukakis, the creature of Brookline, Swarthmore, the ACLU, the Kennedy School, the governorship of the only state to vote for George McGovern. He quickly proclaimed that the election was not about ideology but competence. &quot;Where was George?&quot; intoned the Senator from Massachusetts. Ann Richards told a guffawing Democratic Convention: &quot;Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.&quot;    This was neither random nastiness nor any particular animus to George Bush. It was a calculated political strategy. George McGovern proved that liberals cannot win on social issues or foreign policy. Walter Mondale proved liberals cannot win on domestic issues, particularly higher taxes to finance the spending their programs demand. The only tactic left was to run away from issues, to hide the L-word while trying to discredit your opposition personally.    Mr. Ailes foiled the ploy by introducing some issues, by holding Governor Dukakis to account for his record, by demonstrating that he is solidly within the McGovern-Mondale liberal mainstream. In this Mr. Ailes was stunningly successful, not least in moving the minds of the Dukakis campaign and the media. By now, any examination of the Governor's record is described as &quot;negative material&quot; and the very word &quot;liberal&quot; is considered a smear.    As the only players on the field Mr. Ailes and his principal got their choice of the issues, of course, and somehow their critics don't enjoy the ones they picked. With the Pledge, the furlough program and the ACLU, they pumped some genuine voter concerns into the election. To suggest, as many commentators have, that voters don't understand the larger message in these issues, or that they are being duped by them, is simply a tacit admission that liberalism no longer defends the gestalt that has animated its politics for more than 20 years.    The Pledge issue is indeed about patriotism, but surely all serious people understand that patriotism isn't merely about &quot;loving one's country.&quot; Patriotism is fundamentally about defense policy, about men in uniform and weapons and doing what is necessary to ensure U.S. security. It wasn't Roger Ailes who caused Governor Dukakis to oppose putting the GWEN submarine-communications system in Massachusetts. Governor Dukakis also tried to stop 13 public-relations specialists in his state's National Guard from being sent on exercises in Central America; he was slapped down this week in a one-sentence sound bite, not from Roger Ailes, but from a federal Appeals Court upholding a lower-court decision.    The &quot;negative campaign&quot; chorus wails that Mr. Dukakis didn't create Massachusetts' furlough program, but who said he did? His state's program is unique in releasing felons early in their sentences, rather than at the end. Presented with a bill that would have eliminated furloughs for first-degree murderers sentenced to life without parole, Mr. Dukakis pocket-vetoed it. The program continued. Willie Horton escaped.    Roger Ailes' commercials didn't create the public's obviously real concerns about the U.S. criminal-justice system. Nor do we recall hearing liberal accusations of &quot;racism&quot;' when vigilantes in Harlem beat to death a homicidal mugger or when blacks unloosed Black Muslims on drug-infested neighborhoods or when blacks in Los Angeles tried to tax themselves to hire more neighborhood police. If professional liberals don't understand the pull of the crime issue, it may be because they no longer understand their traditional constituencies.    To buy the argument that Roger Ailes' &quot;negative campaign&quot; is putting George Bush in the presidency, you have to believe that voters live in a time warp, that they don't know which President's policies preceded Mr. Bush's, that they don't remember what the names Mondale, Carter and McGovern stood for, that they don't know that Democratic voters freely picked Mr. Dukakis as the cream of a crop that included Messrs. Gephardt, Simon, Babbitt, Jackson, Gore, Hart and Biden.    Maybe next time, the Democrats should hire Roger Ailes to explain to them what is going on out there beyond the Beltway chorus, in the part of the country that actually determines who wins these elections. </TEXT></DOC>
