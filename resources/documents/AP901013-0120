Among them were two young Ugandan boys, who showed gruesomemarks on their backs they said came from being jabbed withbayonets.   ``The wounds are three or four days old and haven't been lookedafter yet,'' said the guide who escorted the delegation ofreporters and Western diplomats through the prison.   Rwandan Justice Minister Pheomesee Mutgamama said at least 2,500people have been arrested for allegedly collaborating with therebels who invaded from Uganda. About 1,000 of them have beenreleased, he said.   Some of the detainees complained of squalid conditions andbrutality.   ```If they keep me here much longer my baby will die,'' said aUgandan woman who was nursing her infant. ``My baby is still breastfeeding but because of the bad food in this prison I'm scared Icannot give milk anymore to my baby.''   A man with a swollen mouth said he was beaten with the butt of agun.   ``We were put in a truck,'' he said. ``A young boy tried toescape and he was killed, shot on the spot.''   The government gave permission Saturday for the InternationalRed Cross to visit the prison.   Foreign governments, including the United States, have beenstressing to Rwanda's government that it should respect humanrights and work to avoid the outbreak of an all-out tribal war inRwanda.   Maj.-Gen. Juneval Habyarimana, a member of the majority Hututribe who has ruled Rwanda for 17 years, has been seeking westernmilitary aid for his government. He claims its troops areoutnumbered by the invasion force.   In the early 1960s, the Hutu crushed a Tutsi uprising, killingmore than 10,000 members of the tribe, whose members make up about15 percent of Rwanda's population of 8 million.   The rebel force that invaded from Uganda includes Tutsi refugeesfrom among the hundreds of thousands who were forced to flee in the1960s.</TEXT></DOC>
