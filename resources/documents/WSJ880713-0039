The Atlanta-based software concern said holders authorized a new class of preferred stock. They also voted both to limit directors' liability and to allow management to consider a broad range of factors, including social and economic issues and the competence and experience of a potential acquirer, in considering a takeover offer.    Management Science last month rejected an $11.50-a-share, or $191 million, purchase bid from Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y. After getting that bid, Management Science postponed its annual meeting until yesterday to allow holders more time to consider the proposals in light of the Computer Associates offer.    Management Science said Computer Associates remains interested in buying it but hasn't made further offers; it said the board hasn't changed its position since rejecting the bid. </TEXT></DOC>
