Kemp's decision Thursday follows a highly critical audit of theprogram by HUD's inspector general that said many of the projectswere approved despite warnings by agency analysts that they wereunnecessary or too large.   The program already has cost the government $119 million indirect payments to cover defaults on HUD-insured mortgages, Kempsaid.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors are considering possiblecriminal action in the loss of $2 million of federal housing fundsin Alabama that apparently were used to buy luxury items such as aMercedes, a speedboat, jewelry and furs.   Department of Housing and Urban Development documents obtained byThe Associated Press allege that Montgomery real estate broker CyWalker spent the money over a three-year period by using a stack ofblank wire transfer authorization forms.

George A. Stallings hates the sight ofempty pews, and that's one reason he wants the Roman Catholic Churchto allow a special rite for black Americans.   But a black bishop contends that Stallings, suspended as a priestfor creating an unauthorized parish in Washington, could wind upwith a church that is no different from any other evangelicalcongregation competing for members and dollars.   Stallings, who is black, said in an interview Thursday that theCatholic church is missing the boat in attracting blacks and otherminorities because its hierarchy and traditions are too bound byEuropean culture and dominated by white males.   It fails to evangelize _ make converts _ among blacks because itdoesn't train anyone to do so, he said, adding that other religionsare filling the gap.</TEXT><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Security Council passed a resolutionthat said it ``deeply regrets'' Israel's continued expulsions ofPalestinians from the occupied lands, but the United States in amild rebuke abstained from the vote.
