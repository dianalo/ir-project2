The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 14 points in the first 10 minutes of trading, coming tantalizingly close to the 2300 milestone. But futures-related selling quickly began dragging the market down, and the industrial average ended the day off 11.11 at 2268.98.    The broader market averages also drifted down. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.55 to 290.31, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.18 to 165.39. There were 775 advancing issues and 796 decliners. Big Board volume was active, with more than 57 million shares changing hands in the first hour alone. For the full session, volume was 186.9 million shares, compared with 174.8 million Tuesday.    Traders said the market showed remarkable resilience in the face of heavy selling pressure yesterday morning. &quot;The sellers came into the marketplace, and the buyers just ate it up,&quot; said Dan Marciano, head equity trader at Prudential-Bache Securities.    Jack Baker, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, called it a &quot;standoff&quot; day, with many investors waiting for economic reports about retail sales, producer prices and industrial production scheduled to be issued today and tomorrow. Mr. Baker said there was a flurry of foreign buying and short covering early, but the rest of the day was lackluster.    Much of the early selling pressure resulted from stock-index futures trading. Stephen Malinowski, vice president and national manager of the index futures department at E.F. Hutton, said many traders had bought index futures anticipating a strong opening yesterday. Their expectations were fed by news that Chrysler would be converting some of its huge pension fund to equities from bonds and by a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal that Nomura Securities of Tokyo, the world's biggest brokerage firm, had decided to direct the equivalent of $10.4 billion of clients' cash into non-Japanese equities.    When the market showed less strength than anticipated, some traders began to sell their futures contracts, which drove the price of the futures to a deep discount to the cash index. That in turn triggered some arbitrage programs, in which traders bought the cheaper futures while selling the underlying stocks.    Mr. Malinowski said the March futures contract on the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, which expires March 20, theoretically should be selling for about 0.25 point more than the cash index. When the price of the futures contract falls slightly below the cash index, it shouldn't cause much activity, he said. But yesterday morning, the futures briefly sold for as much as 1.10 points under the cash index.    Two stocks advanced after an announcement yesterday by The Wall Street Journal that two components of the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average would change today. The two that are being added to the average are Coca-Cola, which moved up 2 1/4 to 48 3/4, and Boeing, which rose 2 to 53 3/8. They are replacing Owens Illinois, the object of a leveraged buyout, which ended unchanged at 60 1/4, and Inco, a copper and nickel producer, which fell 3/4 to 14 3/4. Investors whose portfolios are indexed to the market would be most affected by the change.    Supermarkets General gained 7/8 to 42 on volume of more than 2.4 million shares. Monday, the company received a $41.75-a-share offer from Dart Group, and yesterday sources told Dow Jones News Service that Supermarkets General was weighing a number of alternatives to Dart's unsolicited offer. Those include looking for another suitor, buying back some shares or making an acquisition of its own.    W.R. Grace jumped 2 3/8 to 61 3/8, with more than 1.5 million shares changing hands. Although the company Tuesday reported a $560 million loss for the fourth quarter, an analyst who follows the company said its plan to shed its agricultural chemical business was seen as good news for the company. Also, Grace has long been seen as vulnerable to a takeover bid because its management doesn't own much of the company's stock, and the company's breakup value is thought to be between $75 and $90 a share.    American Stores gained 2 3/4 to 70. Tuesday, the company's board authorized the buyback of an additional one million common shares. The company earlier announced plans to buy back two million shares.    Du Pont rose 1 to 109. A chemical analyst at a major investment banking firm reportedly recommended the stock. Some other blue-chip issues fell. International Business Machines declined 1 1/8 to 141 3/4, American Express dropped 3/4 to 78 1/4, Merck fell 1 3/4 to 158 3/8 and Chrysler fell 1/4 to 54 1/2.    Airlines fell, partly in response to oil prices, which surged in response to sharp drops in weekly U.S. inventory levels. Delta Air Lines fell 1 3/4 to 61 1/2, AMR dropped 1 1/8 to 57 1/8 and NWA dropped 1 1/2 to 70 1/2.    Home Shopping Network plummeted 5 5/8 to 23 7/8 as more than 3.2 million shares changed hands. The company announced increased earnings, but analysts apparently had expected a more dramatic rise.    In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 2.04 to 431.43, a record. Volume expanded to 155.8 million shares from 141.3 million Tuesday. There were 1,343 issues advancing and 944 declining.    Crazy Eddie dropped 1 5/8 to 8 3/8 on volume of nearly 4.7 million shares. Tuesday, the company announced that comparable store sales for the latest quarter fell 19%.    Elsewhere in the OTC market, a new offering of a million shares of Action Auto Rental was offered at $12, opened at $15 and closed at $17. </TEXT></DOC>
