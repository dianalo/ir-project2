Your Salomon scandal articles, forexample, have given no information about the status of JohnGutfreund, Thomas Strauss, Donald Feuerstein, Thomas Mozer orJohn Meriwether as grandparents or parents.   Now, I'm sure the only reason you describe Dorothy Hutsonas a grandmother is the ironic contrast with the trustingimage that grandparents have. But isn't the Salomon scandalalso an issue of trust? And surely a firm name like SalomonBrothers cries out for some detail on family matters.</LP><TEXT>   I hope future articles about Salomon will include thisimportant kind of information. After all, your readers needto know just as much about John, Thomas, Donald, et al. asabout Dorothy.   Melissa A. Berman   New York</TEXT></DOC>
