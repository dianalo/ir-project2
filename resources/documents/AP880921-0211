But a gloom that has enveloped Italy's war against the Mafiafollows the graying magistrate like a cloud, even as he relaxesoutside his beachfront vacation home.   ``A certain weariness has overcome Palermo,'' he says, staringbroodingly at the purple Sicilian hills. ``Today the commitment tofight the Mafia isn't as strong as before.''   Government and police officials in the Sicilian capital expresssimilar feelings. They speak of blocked investigations, ofpolitical indifference, of threats to those who take on the mob.   The problem has grown so serious that Italy's president,Francesco Cossiga, recently demanded an inquiry into investigationsin Palermo, headquarters of the Mafia and its multibillion-dollardrug trade.   Shortly thereafter, Giovanni Falcone, Italy's top Mafiainvestigator, submitted his resignation, saying working conditionswere impossible. He withdrew the resignation last week, but his actin the beginning had a demoralizing impact.   While some blame weariness for the investigative problems,others see the corrupting hand of the Mafia.   ``Today, in these months, there is a new effort by the darkforce to reappropriate the city,'' declares the Rev. EnnioPintacuda, a Jesuit priest who advises the Palermo government.   The case has alarmed the national government, which hasappointed a new Mafia commissioner. It also has raised concern atthe U.S. Justice Department, which conducts joint investigations ofthe Mafia with Italian officials.   At the center of the crisis are a group of investigatingmagistrates, who in the Italian legal system draw up indictments,using police and judicial methods. They often work alone.   Falcone, Borsellino and his colleagues instead formed a pool sothat the Mafia could not, as in the past, kill off a case bykilling off an investigator.   In the five years since, the magistrates' intensive teamwork haspaid off with evidence not only about the Mafia's local operation,but its business in Europe and the United States as well.   It culminated in 338 convictions this past December in the``maxi-trial'' of Mafia members accused of murder, robbery and drugtrafficking to the U.S. East Coast.   It also contributed to the 18 convictions in the ``PizzaConnection'' trial of heroin suppliers who used American pizzaparlors as fronts.   But since January, when Italy's Superior Council of Magistrateschose 68-year-old Judge Antonino Meli to head the ``anti-Mafiapool,'' a split has developed in the unit. The Council passed overthe 49-year-old Falcone, ruling he was too young.   ``A few months after Meli took over, the system was changedcompletely,'' says Borsellino, who left the team last year.   The new director began sending Mafia cases to judges outside thepool, and assigning non-Mafia cases to pool members, he says.   ``We are returning to the system of the '60s, in which eachjudge did his job and no one knew what anyone else was doing _ andno one had a global view of the Mafia,'' asserts Borsellino.   He complained publicly in July and the Italian president orderedan investigation. A week later, Falcone resigned and his poolcolleagues threatened to follow.   ``We feel we are in danger of losing a way of coordination inthe fight against the Mafia that brought optimal results,'' sayspool member Gioacchino Natoli.   Meli's office said he would not comment on the accusations. Inhis few public remarks, he has said he spread cases among differentjudges to increase the level of experience.   The other magistrates say Meli, with little experience in Mafiainvestigations, does not realize the importance of specialization.   Other people insist the problem is political influence.   ``It could be that instead of direct pressure, it's anenvironment created by that part of the city that says the Mafia isnot a danger,'' says Pintacuda. ``In that group are alsopoliticians.''   On Sept. 14, the Superior Council of Magistrates concluded thatno one had tried to remove the pool from Mafia cases. But it alsoendorsed the pool's working methods.   Even if the magistrates remain, the split in the judiciary hashurt.   Tommaso Buscetta, a key Mafia informer, said he would not makefurther disclosures while the judges were divided. Importantinvestigations have languished, according to U.S. officials.   In Natoli's office, next to a window with double rows ofbulletproof glass, hang plaques from the FBI, the U.S. DrugEnforcement Administration and the New York City Police Department.   ``When all the institutions have worked together, we have hadsplendid results,'' says the 41-year-old Natoli.   The judges' difficulties, he adds, have been exacerbated by adecline in support from such institutions as the police andparliament in Rome.   It was parliament that provided the key to many past successesagainst the Mafia. In 1982, it established a new crime, that ofMafia association, and allowed inspection of suspects' bank records.   But there has been no movement on judges' requests for a witnessprotection program or a provision to reduce informers' sentences.   ``There have been moments in which it has appeared the statewould resolve the problem,'' Natoli says, fingering his gold-framedglasses. ``Later it is always set aside.''   More problematic, he adds, has been the police situation. Thedetective unit that formerly handled Mafia investigations has beendestroyed by two Mafia assassinations and the arrests of severalofficers in the death of one of the suspected assassins.   One of the last members of the unit, Francesco Accordino, wasrecently transferred after receiving death threats reportedlytraced to a police telephone.   The threats to Italy's war on organized crime have come just asthe ``anti-Mafia pool'' was beginning to focus on politicians'links to the Mafia. Some say the timing is no coincidence.   ``When judges limit themselves to trying (Mafia chief Michele)Greco, fine,'' says Carmine Mancuso, a police inspector who alsoheads a citizen's group to rally popular support against the Mafia.``The problem begins when Falcone and the others begin to talkabout political investigations.''   The wail of sirens has increased this summer in Palermo.Magistrates and government officials speed past in policemotorcades. Authorities recently increased security for thoseactive in the war on the Mafia, even assigning bodyguards to twopriests.   At Borsellino's house a bodyguard in sunglasses and a pink,open-necked shirt relaxes on a lounge chair, his large black pistolhidden in a folded newspaper.   ``Society has paid a terribly high price for the war on theMafia,'' Borsellino says. ``This has created a climate ofweariness.''   Mayor Leoluca Orlando of Palermo says the public hasn't lostheart. And he notes the government has responded to the crisis bynaming a prominent anti-terrorism investigator, Domenico Sica, asthe Mafia commissioner and increasing his investigative powers.   ``The state made a strong effort during the maxi-trial,''Orlando says. ``The message was clear. We must recover that clarityto move forward.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 25</NOTE></DOC>
