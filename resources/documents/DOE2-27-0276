<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0276 </DOCNO><TEXT>GKS graphics software provides a device independent method of producinggraphics on a number of different devices, but it is a rather low levelpackage which is difficult to use. The GPLOT Fortran library of graphicstools discussed here can be used to simplify the creation of scientificgraphics with VAX GKS[GPL]. GPLOT contains routines for drawing and labellingof axes for linear, log, and log-log plots. It supports the drawing ofdata curves with or without markers and/or error bars on the data points.It provides routines for producing a legend which automatically keepstrack of the line type, color, and marker type used in producing eachof the curves on a plot. There are also routines for producing contourplots, bar graphs and for drawing vectors with various types of arrowheads. GPLOT allows setting the text font by font name and attributes.It also allows the definition of switch characters to switch fonts ordo subscripts and superscripts using instructions embedded in the string.GPLOT supports the GKS feature of multiple active workstations whichallows creation of hardcopy plots while plotting to the screen. GPLOTsupports creation of GKS metafiles and includes a program for interpretingand plotting GKS metafiles. It also supports graphics locator input withconversion of coordinates to user units if desired. To simplify userinteraction during input, there are routines for switching between VT220mode and graphics mode. A number of examples are presented. 12 refs.,6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
