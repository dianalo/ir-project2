Schwartz, 202/453-8344.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>NASA published a proposed rule establishingits policies, responsibilities and procedures relative to the NationalSpace Grant College and Fellowship Program, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 13, 1989, (54 FR 10357). Comments fromtwo sources were received. Each commenter requested that the requirementfor matching funds be waived for Historically Black Colleges and Universities(HBCU's). Both requested specific language assuring that HBCU's may participatefully in the program, one by urging that a representative number of HBCU'sbe designated as Space Grant Colleges/Consortia. Both requested that NASAplace greater emphasis on HBCU undergraduate science and engineering programs,specifically with regard to the participation of women and minorities.A major objective of the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Programis the broadening of the university network participating with NASA inaerospace activities. The program has been specifically designed to requiremajor aerospace universities to collaborate with and involve HBCU's andother schools not qualifying for designation in cooperative activities.A waiver of the matching funds requirement would negate the ability ofthe institution to attract funds from other sources, thus obviating theobjective of university/industry collaboration. NASA believes that thefinal program announcement reflects considerable emphasis on educationat all levels, particularly undergraduate, and especially on the involvementof underrepresented minority groups and women in all aspects of the program.NASA believes the issues raised by the commenters are adequately addressedin the program as currently designed and do not need to be amended to theregulations.NASA has determined that this rule does not constitute a major rule forthe purpose of Executive Order 12291 and it will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small business entities underthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 1259</ITAG>Aerospace, Consortium, Fellowship program, Higher education, Space, Spacegrant college.Part 1259 is added to Title 14, Chapter V, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1259_NATIONAL SPACE GRANT COLLEGE AND FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 1_Basic Policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.100 Scope of part.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.101 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.102 General policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.103 Special authorities_gift acceptance and other Federal funding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 2_Space Grant Program and Project Awards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.200 Description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.201 Types of Space Grant program and project awards_regular andspecial.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.202 Application procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.203 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 3_National Needs Grants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.300 Description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.301 Identification of national needs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.302 Application procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.303 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 4_Space Grant College and Consortium Designation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.400 Description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.401 Responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.402 Basic criteria and application procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.403 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.404 Suspension or termination of designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 5_Space Grant Fellowships</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.500 Description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.501 Responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.502 Application procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.503 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 6_Space Grant Review Panel</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.600 Panel description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.601 Establishment and composition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.602 Conflict of interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1259.603 Responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Pub.
