On other commodity markets, cattle futures also advanced; cocoaand coffee futures surged; precious metals retreated; oil futureswere mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.   Hog futures settled .25 cents to the permitted daily limit of1.5 cents higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with thecontract for delivery in June at 65 cents a pound.   Frozen pork belly futures ended 1.47 cents to the limit 2 centshigher with May at 64.22 cents a pound.   In cattle futures trading on the Merc, live cattle settled .15cent to .87 cent higher with June at 74.42 cents a pound; feedercattle were unchanged to .63 cent higher with May at 84.75 cents apound.   Analysts said the cattle rally reflected spillover buyingenthusiasm from the adjacent pork pits.   Pork futures generally have been in an upward trend since lateFebruary, partly due to a decline in hog slaughters that defiednormal seasonal patterns.   Wednesday's rally appeared to be rooted in the Merc's weeklyreport Tuesday on belly stocks in commercial freezers outside ofChicago. The report showed a net decline of 199,000 pounds insteadof the expected increase of up to 1.5 million pounds.   The report was startling, according to Charles Levitt, seniorlivestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   ``I don't recall it ever having occurred,'' he said.   Pork bellies are the part of a hog from which bacon is made. Butwith hog slaughters declining on a year-to-year basis, Levitt saidmeat packers also are using bellies in hot dogs and pork sausages.   Meanwhile, rising hog prices have made it profitable forproducers to fatten up their animals a bit more before marketingthem, which is contributing to the slower slaughter pace, analystssaid.   Hog prices normally reach an annual peak in mid-summer.   Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., said marketsentiment is divided between those who think the rally already isat or near its peak and those who believe hog futures will exceedthe record high of 68 cents a pound reached on Aug. 20, 1982.   ``Those people sure came out of the woodwork today,'' Morgansaid.   Cocoa futures climbed to their highest levels in nearly 14months on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid news ofnew anti-government protests by soldiers in the Ivory Coast, theworld's largest cocoa producer.   Cocoa settled $35 to $38 higher with the July contract at $1,433per ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa contractsince March 22, 1989.   Coffee futures also rose sharply in New York amid reports thatColombia had moved to tighten coffee exports.   Coffee settled 1.2 cents to 2.33 cents higher with May at 93.63cents a pound.   Inflation-sensitive precious metal futures fell on New York'sCommodity Exchange after the government reported a moderate 0.2percent rise in consumer prices in April.   Gold futures settled $1.90 to $2.40 lower with June at $370.30 atroy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.5 cent lower with May at $5.01a troy ounce.   Energy futures were mixed in fairly heavy trading on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange with prices of near-term crude oildeliveries tumbling and unleaded gasoline gaining ground.   The action followed Tuesday's weekly American PetroleumInstitute stocks report showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crudestocks and a surprising drop in gasoline supplies.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 56 cents lower to .04cent higher with June at $19.03 a barrel; heating oil was .05 centto .23 cent lower with June at 51.63 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .35 cent lower to .66 cent higher with June at 64.17cents a gallon.
