AC power adapter, $70; car battery adapter, $45; networkadapter, $695.andP;  Expansion chassis with 5 slots, $595; with 8 slots, $795.andO;Numeric keypad, $70.andM;Size, price, expansion, and speed are all good reasons to buy the 20-MHz386SX Chicony-made notebook sold by Micro Express and Tangent.andP;  Called theMicro Express NB5620 or the Tangent 320N, each system, with a 20MB hard disk,sells for $2,224 or $2,183, respectively.andP;  Aside from batteries that lastroughly 2 hours and no space for an internal modem, these identical notebooksystems give you a fair return for your money.andM;At 7.1 pounds with battery and with measurements of 2 by 11.8 by 8.3 inches,the system is a little larger than the ideal notebook.andP;  But the 1.5- by 5.8-by 3-inch AC adapter weighs only 1.3 pounds and the standard leatherette caseweighs 0.7 pounds.andP;  A complete system with an extra battery and a couple ofcables will weigh in at around 10 pounds-a pound less than some of the othersin this roundup.andM;The Tangent/Micro Express's backlit supertwist LCD display is manufactured bySanyo.andP;  This VGA display system shows a maximum of 16 gray scales.andP;  Smalladjustment wheels mounted on the right side rim of the display panel giveadequate control of screen brightness and contrast.andP;  The screen, whichmeasures 5.4 by 7.5 inches, is amply sized and does a fine job of displayingWindows 3.0, although, as with all gray-scale LCD screens, the Windows colorsleave a lot to be desired.andM;The keyboard of the Tangent/Micro Express machine is superior.andP;  It has goodtravel and feel, along with quiet operation.andP;  But most important, it hasseparate page- and cursor-movement keys, with the inverted-T layout that hasbecome indispensible for most notebook users.andP;  The system's ten function keysare roughly two-thirds size and are conveniently located in the usual placeacross the top of the keyboard.andM;The Tangent/Micro Express's battery slides into a compartment on the bottomof the unit.andP;  The battery on the Micro Express version ran for 2 hours 8minutes, and the Tangent went on for 1 hour 41 minutes on PC Labs' BatteryRundown test.andP;  The difference in battery life is attributable to thecomputers themselves and not the batteries or chargers: We ran subsequenttests switching batteries and battery chargers between the two machines, andthe Micro Express system consistently ran longer on battery power than theTangent machine, though the differences grew somewhat less noticeable insubsequent rundowns.andM;Overall, however, 2 hours or less of battery operation isn't much, andcarrying two extra batteries on a transcontinental flight also will add acouple more pounds to your bag.andP;  With the AC adapter attached and the systemoff, it takes 2 hours to recharge the battery and only 4 hours to rechargewith the system in use, both very good times.andM;The only battery conservation technique, set via disk-based software, slowsthe system down to 3 MHz and shuts off the LCD screen at inactivity intervalsof 1 to 9 minutes.andP;  While this sleep mode, which is accessible only by timeinterval and not by a hotkey combination or by closing the cover, doesn'tappreciably increase battery life (rated at 4 or more hours in sleep mode),it does offer compatibility with Windows 3.0, a feature shared by few othernotebooks' sleep modes.andM;SIMPLE MEMORY ADD-ONandM;Adding memory to Tangent or Micro Express systems is simple.andP;  The standard1MB RAM can be increased to either 2MB or 5MB total by adding a memory optioncard in a slot on the bottom of the unit revealed behind a simple slide-offcover.andP;  For the 1 MB and 4MB memory add-on cards, Micro Express charges $150and $450 and Tangent charges $100 and $400-quite reasonable, given the highmemory prices charged by other vendors.andM;Both vendors market this notebook system via direct sales with similar pricesand service policies.andP;  Tangent currently offers a wider range of options.andO;Along with many other notebook vendors, both Tangent and Micro Express arewaiting for Conner Peripherals to catch up with the demand forlarger-than-20MB hard disk options.andP;  By the time this article is published,they should be able to deliver systems with optional larger-size hard disks.andM;Micro Express sells its notebook with a 15-month parts and labor warrantywith a 30-day money-back guarantee, and toll-free technical support.andP;  Serviceis obtained by sending the machine back to the vendor, who will pay shippingcosts both ways for the first four months and one way after that.andP;  Tangentpays shipping costs for repairs both ways throughout its one-year warrantyperiod and also offers a 30-day money-back guarantee and toll-free technicalsupport.andM;Micro Express will sell a 40MB hard disk upgrade for $250 over the base 20MBprice and a 60MB upgrade for $350 over base-rather inexpensive consideringthe competition's steep upgrade prices.andP;  Micro Express also sells an external1.2MB floppy ddisk for $120.andP;  Tangent offers 30MB, 40MB, and 60MB disk sizesfor $150, $225, and $295 over the base model and charges $150 for an external1.2MB floppy disk drive.andM;Tangent also sells an expansion box that plugs into the parallel port withfive 16-bit slots, two half-height 5.25-inch drive bays, and a power supplyfor $595.andP;  An eight-slot version sells for $795.andP;  The expansion box workswith I/O cards, external drives, and network cards via driver software thatroutes all signals through the notebook's parallel port.andP;  SCSI devices arenot currently supported, nor are any external devices that can't coexist withthe internal VGA circuitry or require special device drivers.andM;The combination of a 20-MHz processor, good expansion capability, and adynamite keyboard would make either the Tangent 32ON or the Micro ExpressNB5620 notebook easy to recommend, especially considering the low price, butits slightly higher-than-average weight and its lack of space for an internalmodem might hold you back.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
