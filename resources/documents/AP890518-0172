The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in a report to the TreasuryDepartment, said that since beginning the takeover of the nation'smost deeply insolvent Sandamp;Ls on Feb. 7, its examiners have uncoveredpotential criminal violations in about 50 institutions and referredthe cases to the Justice Department.   That's in addition to possible fraud already uncovered by theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, which previously had responsibilityfor the institutions.   James Dudine, director of the FDIC's anti-fraud effort, saidthere are indications of crime at as many as half of the 219institutions put under government control in preparation for theenactment of President Bush's Sandamp;L bailout plan.   Dudine said that many of the Justice Department referralsinvolved additional evidence in previously known cases rather thanentirely new cases. More than half of the new evidence wasuncovered in Texas Sandamp;Ls, he said.   In a typical fraud case, an Sandamp;L official has an undisclosedinterest in a a commercial real estate project that received a loanfrom the institution and couldn't repay it, Dudine said.   Under Bush's Sandamp;L reform proposals, the FDIC, which insuresdeposits at commercial banks, would also get that responsibilityfor Sandamp;Ls. While Congress debates the proposal, the FDIC, underBush's orders, is taking over the worst Sandamp;Ls, cataloging theirlosses, looking for fraud and preparing them for sale to privateinvestors.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman told reporters that accumulatedlosses at the Sandamp;Ls under supervision by April 15 totaled $29.8billion, representing 40 percent of the institutions' combinedassets of $73.4 billion.   The agency plans to take control of about 60 more institutionsby July, bringing the total assets to $115.5 billion.   The nearly $30 billion in losses is in line with the estimatesof the Bush administration, which hopes to spend $50 billion toclose all institutions now insolvent or that slip into insolvencyin the next three years, roughly 500.   Seidman said the $50 billion should be enough because the failedinstitutions not yet under government control are in better shape.   ``From what we know now, this is enough money. ... If things getworse, it clearly won't be enough money,'' he said.   Seidman defended his agency against charges it is allowinginstitutions under its control to pay high interest rates, thushurting solvent Sandamp;Ls trying to compete for deposits.   ``Why don't we order them to pay less? Of course we can do that,but if we did, they wouldn't get the deposits they need to fundthemselves,'' Seidman said.   The FDIC estimated that the thrifts under its control have lost$3.4 billion in deposits, but Seidman said he expected the outflowto taper off if interest rates remain stable or decline as someeconomists predict.   On another matter, the FDIC acknowledged that its had to cutback on supervision of commercial banks and after assigning 1,029employees to the failed Sandamp;Ls. Seidman said bank examinations sincethe start of February are down 22 percent from the same period ayear ago. Nevertheless, he said the agency expects to completeabout 4,100 bank examinations this year, up from 4,019 from in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
