<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-33-0108 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is provided for wetting a graphite substrate and spreading aa boron alloy over the substrate. The wetted substrate may be in theform of a needle for an effective ion emission source. The method mayalso be used to wet a graphite substrate for subsequent joining withanother graphite substrate or other metal, or to form a protective coatingover a graphite substrate. A noneutectic alloy of boron is formed witha metal selected from the group consisting of nickel (Ni), palladium(Pd), and platinum (Pt) with excess boron, i.e., and atomic percentageof boron effective to precipitate boron at a wetting temperature of lessthan the liquid-phase boundary temperature of the alloy. The alloy isapplied to the substrate and the graphite substrate is then heated tothe wetting temperature and maintained at the wetting temperature fora time effective for the alloy to wet and spread over the substrate.The excess boron is evenly dispersed in the alloy and is readily availableto promote the wetting and spreading action of the alloy. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
