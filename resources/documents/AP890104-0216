To some, it's like a vision of the Promised Land _ and many aretempted to stay in this country to start careers.   Currently, 356,200 students from other countries attend more than2,000 colleges and universities across America, and as many asone-fifth of them do in fact stay on.   ``Our best estimate is that in recent years only 80 to 85 percentof foreign students in the United States returned home,'' says JackReichard, vice president of the Washington-based NationalAssociation for Foreign Student Affairs.   Moreover, 50-60 percent of foreign students studying science andengineering _ a vital area for their countries as well as the UnitedStates _ decide to stay, according to a study by the NationalScience Foundation.   About 40 percent of non-American Ph.D. recipients in science andengineering seek jobs in this country, and about 40 percent ofAmerican university science and engineering faculty members underthe age of 35 are now foreign nationals, according to the NationalAcademy of Sciences.   Whether these young intellectuals of the world should stay on tomake their careers in America or return home is a question ingrowing contention. Their individual decisions to stay or to go homecould have a considerable impact on world affairs.   Leon Febres Cordero, who earned a Bachelor of Engineering degreeat Stevens in 1953, completed a four-year term as president ofEcuador last August.   Niklos Nemeth, an economist with postgraduate training at HarvardUniversity, was named in November to be prime minister of Hungary.   Benazir Bhutto, who has a BA from Radcliffe College, became primeminister of Pakistan, elected in December as the first woman ever tohead a Moslem government.   In dozens of other nations of every political persuasion,graduates of American universities have occupied positions ofinfluence and power in politics, industry and other fields.   Foreign students who decided to stay on in the United States havebeen no less successful.   Shanghai-born An Wang, who was sent to study physics at Harvardby President Chiang Kai-shek of Nationalist China, stayed on in theUnited States to found Wang Laboratories, a major scientificcompany, and make a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $365million.   The average foreign university student attends courses for about3.5 years, Reichard said in a telephone interview. So it may beestimated, with about 350,000 foreign students in the country, thatapproximately 100,000 new university-level students enter thecountry each year.   According to U.S immigration figures, about 20,000 of theseforeign youths, among the world's best and brightest, trade in theirstudent visas for immigration cards.   The foreign students come from 186 countries and territories. Twothirds of them are from developing nations, where in many cases adepressing paradox awaits them on their return home: there is adesperate need for their knowledge, but jobs are scarce and poorlypaid even at the advanced level they have achieved.   So the temptation to remain in the United States is strong.   Making it even stronger is the encouragement of some Americanbusiness and academic leaders, acutely aware of a shortage ofAmerican-born science students in particular.   According to the Council on Competitiveness, the United Statescould face a shortfall of 500,000 American-born scientists andengineers by the year 2010 due to retirements and the decliningnumber of American students choosing careers in these fields.   The Council, composed of 151 chief executives of industry, laborand higher education, also noted in a report last July that 1,300 to1,800 engineering positions are vacant even now at Americanuniversities.   ``How can we replenish these faculty positions?'' asks StevensPresident Harold J. Raveche. ``It takes 10,000 high school studentsexpressing an interest in a science or engineering major to assureus of 20 doctorates.''   ``We should talk about our education deficit rather than aboutour budget deficit,'' says Kenneth Wilson, 1982 winner of the Nobelphysics prize. ``We need math and science teachers,'' he said duringa forum on U.S. competitiveness at Stevens.   The academic gap is being filled by an increasing number ofprofessors from other countries, particularly India, Japan and otherAsian nations.   Sixty percent of all foreign students in the United States are inengineering, mathematics, computer sciences, physical and lifesciences or management-related fields, according to the NewYork-based Institute of International Education, which administersinternational scholarship programs and places thousands of foreignstudents in U.S. schools.   ``An important policy need is to encourage developing-countrynationals to return home. Their U.S. education should represent abrain gain, not a drain,'' says Institute chairman Charles H. Percy,a former Illinois senator.   Dissenting, Peter Sprague, chairman of the board of NationalSemiconductor Corp., notes that ``the American university system isunmatched in the world, and the United States is a mecca for foreignstudents.   ``About half our science and engineering graduate students areforeigners. We should give them green cards,'' admitting them asimmigrants, said Sprague at the Stevens forum. He said he spoke forthe high technology industries of California's Silicon Valley.   While U.S. universities may set a high standard, American primaryand secondary education is often inadequate, said PulitzerPrize-winning author David Halberstam at the Stevens forum.   ``Technical universities like Stevens are at the cutting edge ofeconomic development,'' he said, ``but the Japanese are killing usin ninth grade mathematics.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 8</NOTE></DOC>
