Speaking to reporters, Treasury Secretary James Baker said the economic outlook remains bright and that markets &quot;will eventually adjust&quot; to that view. He made it clear he doesn't expect the Federal Reserve Board to push interest rates higher. &quot;I believe Chairman (Alan) Greenspan and his board when they say inflationary fears are unjustified,&quot; Mr. Baker said. &quot;And I think investors will ultimately believe them as well.&quot;    Mr. Baker also hinted the U.S. might favor lowering the officially supported range of exchange rates for the dollar unless other nations, especially West Germany, stop raising interest rates.    He criticized recent German interest rate rises, which put upward pressure on U.S. rates, and said his comments were intended as a message to Bonn. The major industrial countries have been supporting the dollar within an unpublicized range, and any drop in the dollar against the mark would be unwelcome in Germany.    Separately, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said during a speech in Chicago that &quot;inflation is under control.&quot; He said that recent moves in the financial markets reflect &quot;extreme nervousness&quot; and &quot;a lot of uncertainty.&quot;    Mr. Baker and Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, spoke to reporters yesterday after a meeting with President Reagan. Mr. Baker said the briefing &quot;was scheduled some time ago and is not being conducted in response to any particular market reaction.&quot;    But while the briefing was originally scheduled to give the officials an opportunity to crow about the economy's recent good behavior, Mr. Baker and Mr. Sprinkel instead were forced to focus on three trouble spots -- a stubbornly persistent trade deficit, rising interest rates and a plunging stock market.    The Treasury secretary noted the trade deficit &quot;has been slow to turn down.&quot; But he said that in terms of volume, rather than dollars, the deficit &quot;has improved for three straight quarters.&quot;    Referring to the stock market, Mr. Baker said the declines of recent weeks are &quot;coming off of very high levels&quot; and that in percentage terms, Wednesday's steep drop was &quot;a non-record 3.8%.&quot;    On interest rates, Mr. Baker and Mr. Sprinkel both insisted that recent increases weren't justified and would probably be reversed. &quot;Over time, one of two things will occur,&quot; Mr. Sprinkel said. &quot;Either inflation will go up, which I'm quite confident won't happen, or interest rates will go down.&quot;    The briefing occurred only a few minutes after Chemical Bank of New York announced it was raising its prime, or base, lending rate to 9 3/4% from 9 1/4%. Mr. Baker brushed off that news.    &quot;We don't get in the business of arm-twisting banks,&quot; he said. &quot;But the argument may be made they are simply following market rates in this instance.&quot;    The Treasury Secretary sharply criticized West Germany, which has spurred interest rate fears world-wide by nudging up short-term rates on the grounds that inflation was a threat. And Mr. Baker hinted that the U.S. might support changing the terms of last February's Louvre accord among the seven major industrial democracies, which set a broad, secret exchange-rate range for the dollar and coordinated economic policy actions in each country.    Under the accord, West Germany was supposed to stimulate its economy. Instead, it has recently been tightening monetary policy and has publicly criticized the policy-coordination process Mr. Baker has championed.    The recent rise in rates abroad, &quot;particularly in the Federal Republic of Germany,&quot; Mr. Baker said, &quot;is not, of course, a trend which we favor, and we do not think that this rise is reflective of the spirit of our recent consultations.&quot;    He said the Louvre accord is &quot;flexible enough&quot; to accommodate changed economic conditions. While Mr. Baker refused to say whether this meant lowering the supported rate of the dollar against the mark, he referred questioners to the agreement last April under which the dollar-yen rate was altered to reflect economic policies in Japan.    &quot;We have seen adjustments under the Louvre framework before, for example the substantial yen-dollar adjustment in April,&quot; he said. &quot;I have no doubt that the Louvre framework can and will accommodate further adjustments as they become necessary.&quot;    His comments reflect private thinking in both the administration and the Federal Reserve that Germany's continued refusal to stimulate could justify a lower dollar range. Fed Vice Chairman Johnson has said that if the dollar falls because of excessively tight monetary policies overseas, the Fed might be prepared to let it fall, rather than support it with higher interest rates in the U.S.    Mr. Baker said, &quot;I'm not suggesting that this&quot; adjustment of the Louvre accord &quot;necessarily would&quot; involve exchange rates. But he added: &quot;We need to look at macroeconomic policy measures, one of which is monetary policy.&quot;    Asked if there has been any reaction from Bonn to these views, he said he was using yesterday's press conference to send a message. &quot;I just now communicated with the Germans not what we want, but that we are really not particularly pleased,&quot; he said. &quot;This was the communication.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Industrials Fall 57.61 Points, Mostly on Late Sell-Off, As Rally Attempts Fail&quot; -- WSJ Oct. 16, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
