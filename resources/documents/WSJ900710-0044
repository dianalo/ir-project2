Forty-five percent of adults in the U.S. have been calledat least once for jury duty, up from 35% in 1984, accordingto the study by the consulting firm of Research andamp; Forecasts,Inc.</LP><TEXT>   Jury scholars link the increase to innovations in courtadministration, including better methods of identifying andfinding potential jurors and greater efforts to limit thelength of most jurors' service.   The survey's sponsor, a group of corporate defense lawyerscalled the Defense Research Institute, also suggests that theexpanded need for jurors may be a byproduct of increasedlitigiousness in the society. Archie Robinson, president ofDRI, says more cases are being filed and prepared for trialthan in the past. In addition, he says, a higher percentageare high-stakes cases that often take a long time to try. Insuch cases, he says, it's customary to call a larger pool ofpotential jurors, since many will be unable to serve in along case and will have to be disqualified.   But jury researchers dispute Mr. Robinson's conclusion.Marc Galanter, a litigation expert at the University ofWisconsin law school, says available data in several largestates indicates that the number of civil jury trials did notincrease between 1984 and 1988. In federal court, there were5,555 civil jury trials in 1984 and 5,676 in 1989, he said.   Any increased need for jurors, Mr. Galanter says, isprobably the result of &quot;a lot more of an intent to use jurorsefficiently.&quot; He adds, &quot;In a lot of places they instituted aone trial, one day system, so they call more people and don'tkeep them sitting as long.&quot;   Under such a system, a person is called for a single day,and if he is not assigned to a trial that day he is notrequired to return. If the person is selected for a longertrial, he must serve for the duration of that trial. The oneday, one trial system is now used in jurisdictions thatembrace about 25% of the U.S. population, according to anestimate by Thomas Munsterman, director of the Center forJury Studies of the National Center for State Courts.   Mr. Munsterman says that another reason more people arebeing called for jury duty is that many courts are expandingtheir methods of finding potential jurors. While mostjurisdictions used to rely primarily on voter-registrationlists, in recent years many have added back-up lists,including driving records. Drivers' lists generally include90%-95% of adults, while only about 70% of adults areregistered to vote in most areas, Mr. Munsterman says.   In other findings, the Defense Research Institute surveydetermined that people with incomes over $40,000 a year aremuch more likely to be called for jury duty than those withincomes income of less than $40,000. In addition, men areslightly more likely to be called than women.   The survey also found that most people who are called onto serve only sit and wait; with most potential jurorsdisqualified for one reason or another before trial, only 17%of adult Americans get to serve on a jury in an actual trial.   ---   WOMEN HARD HATS win an unusual settlement withconstruction company.   Tishman Construction Corp. was sued for alleged sexdiscrimination in 1988 by several female construction workersand by a group that trains women for blue-collar jobs. Tosettle the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Tishmanrecently agreed to begin hiring women for one out of everythree available laborer jobs.   Tishman, a construction-site manager, said that under thesettlement its goal will be for women to make up 10% of itslaborer work force. Currently, about 5% of Tishman's 197laborers are women. According to Nontraditional Employmentfor Women, or NEW, the group that helped bring the lawsuit,women hold only 3% of all laborer jobs on construction sitein New York City.   NEW said it has a waiting list of 80 women looking forconstruction jobs. A spokeswoman said the group hopes the 10%goal will be reached within six months, although thesettlement doesn't provide a deadline for reaching thatlevel. The settlement is in effect for three years.   Henry Estrada, a Tishman vice president, said in astatement: &quot;While Tishman doesn't believe there has beendiscrimination on its part in hiring women for laborer jobs,we are pleased to join with NEW in additional efforts thatwill result in more women entering the construction industrylabor force.&quot;   NEW said it isn't seeking special treatment for women butwants to ensure that female job applicants are evaluatedfairly.   ---   FORMER WEST VIRGINIA governor fails in motion to withdrawguilty plea.

After hearing two months of testimony, jurors in LosAngeles Superior Court yesterday began their task of decidingwhether Raymond Buckey is guilty of eight counts of childmolestation. The charges involve three girls who were oncepupils at the now-defunct Virginia McMartin Preschool inManhattan Beach, Calif., where Mr. Buckey was a teacher.
