The crush came after migrant laborers working in Canton and thesurrounding Pearl River delta returned home for the holiday andtold fellow villagers of the high wages at the region's toy,textile and garment factories.   Most of the peasants quickly returned home because the regioncould not absorb such a sudden and massive influx of unskilledlabor. But smaller waves have continued to pour into the delta.   On the 40th anniversary of Communist rule, this coastal regionof Guangdong province is indeed China's land of plenty. Lush greenrice paddies, orchards and rolling hills spread from the meanderingPearl River. Villages of aging gray brick houses and ostentatiousthree-story, tiled villas vie for space with factories throughoutthe countryside.   But the region's development has more to do with markets thanMarx.   Referring to the decade of market-oriented economic reform undersenior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Yi Kun Cheng, vice governor ofHeshan county near Canton, says, ``The 10-year open policy has beena golden time for China and Heshan.''   Neither he nor other local officials who recently met withforeign reporters offered praise of the preceding 30 years ofCommunist rule, when ideology was stressed over profit.   Now the party's conservative leaders in Beijing, whoconsolidated power after quashing the spring pro-democracymovement, want to reign in coastal regions such as the delta thathave acted with growing autonomy in recent years.   ``It hasn't gotten to the point where there is fear, but therecertainly is tension'' as co AND RADIO OUT</TEXT><HEAD>For Release Sunday, Nov. 5</HEAD><HEAD>From AP Newsfeatures</HEAD><HEAD>(APN SUNDAY ILLUSTRATIONS: Mailed print subscribers get 2 bandamp;w photos.ColorFoto subscribers get 1 35mm slide.)    </HEAD><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   A nearly forgotten program of World War II,called V-12, turned out 60,000 Navy and Marine Corps officers _ andchanged their lives.

JOHNSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The meatloaf on the metal mess trays had thetaste and the look of old times for the aging men ingold-emblazoned Navy blue baseball caps.   The gold read: NAVY V-12. And as they chowed down on Navy beansoup, meatloaf, steamed carrots, mashed potatoes, fruit salad andlots of coffee, they laughed and needled and talked about V-12.   Navy V-12? Hardly anybody remembers it except the men who werein it and the families who have endured stories about it. Now thesemen were here on a mild fall weekend to celebrate what V-12 hadmeant to them and to the country. They called the meeting the NavyV-12 National Colloquium, a fancy name for organized talk. The talkwas plain and not always organized.   If all the talk had been condensed into a theme, it might havebeen: V-12 was the turning point in my life.   V-12 gave boys who grew up in the Depression a chance atcollege. It furnished officers for the Navy and Marine Corps. Ittrained leaders for the future. It kept small schools alive.   All that happened because the Navy saw that the World War IIdraft was devouring potential officer material, and it looked likea long war. So with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's blessing, theNavy created V-12, a program to put college men in uniform and getthem ready for midshipmen's schools and Marine officer candidatesschool.   When the program ended, it had produced more than 60,000 Navyand Marine Corps officers.   Many of its trainees went on to become prominent:   Former Senate Majority Leader and former White House Chief ofStaff Howard Baker, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York,former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, former Commissioner ofBaseball Bowie Kuhn, Heisman Trophy winner Angelo Bertelli, formerWashington Redskins Coach George Allen, actors Jack Lemmon andJackie Cooper, ``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson.   Invitations to the national colloquium, the first since theprogram began 46 years ago, went to about 17,000 known V-12s. Theirnames had been tracked down for a history of V-12 by James G.Schneider, chairman of Kankakee, Ill., Federal Savings and Loan anda V-12 at Milligan College in Tennessee and Duke University. AnnLanders ran a letter from Schneider about the colloquium, and hercolumn produced about 2,000 replies.   About 260 Navy men and 20 Marines turned out. Wives were there,too, about 100 of them. That was enough to dominate a luxury hotel,filling the bars, the elevators, the dining rooms, the meeting roomand the banquet room with blue and gold caps.   Only one of the big names showed.   Baker, Moynihan and Laird had been scheduled on the program.Carson had been invited to be on it.   Moynihan and Laird pleaded intervening business. Carson wrotethat ``the tremendous constraints on my time'' prevented him fromcoming.   ``That's joke No. 1,'' said Peter Hackes of NBC News,introducing a humor session.   Baker found time to drop by the mess tray lunch with a wave forhis old compadres.   But big names hardly mattered. The men were here to see oldfriends and make new ones and, mainly, to talk about old times.   Some asked why so comparatively few had registered.   ``As usual, the Marines were just looking for a few good men,''said an old Marine.   And the organizers said after all, this was a first, and it'shard to get the word out to that many men. People move, addresseschange. And there was the cost of four days in Washington. Somewrote from the West Coast that if the colloquium had been in themiddle of the country _ say, Chicago or Kansas City _ they wouldhave made it.   ``Yes, it's expensive,'' said Navy veteran Fred S. McClory ofGlenview, Ill., ``but it may also be the chance of a lifetime.''   That lifetime for V-12s began on July 1, 1943. High schoolgraduates, college students and men from the fleet reported tounits at 131 colleges ranging in national prominence from Harvard,Yale and Notre Dame to Arizona State Teachers College, LouisianaPolytechnic Institute and Valley City State Teachers College inNorth Dakota. Forty-one of those units had Marine detachments.   Crammed with math, physics and military discipline, the V-12swent on to Navy midshipmen's schools or Marine officer candidatesschool _ and from there to billets at sea and in the field.   After their service, thousands became corporate executives,business owners, doctors, lawyers and judges, bankers, prominentnewspaper and television newsmen, educators and ministers.   The men at the colloquium had registered from 104 of the 131V-12 schools.   They stood at attention at the opening reception to salute thecolors and sing full-throated versions of ``The National Anthem,''``Anchors Aweigh'' and ``The Marines Hymn,'' played by a collegeNaval Reserve drum and bugle corps whose members looked youngenough to be their grandchildren.   And they told their sea stories. There was the one about theNavy chief who warned his men to fall out for the next inspectionin whites just out of the laundry. So one fell out with his uniformstill dripping wet.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
