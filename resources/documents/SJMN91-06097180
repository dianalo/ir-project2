But the Consumer Product SafetyCommission, the National Safety Council and now Workbench magazine are warningof some potential hazards.;    The most serious problem is a door that won'tstop and reverse when it contacts an object. According to Nina Moroz of theNational Safety Council, &quot;since 1982 at least 44 children have died and manyothers have been injured when playing around garage doors.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STORY OPENS EYES ABOUT GARAGE DOORS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO><TEXT>     An accepted safety test for automatic garage door openers made after 1982has been to place a block of wood in the door's closing path. If the doorstruck the wood and reversed it was considered to be operating safely.;    ButWorkbench magazine's managing editor, Bob Gould, conducted tests not only witha wood block but also using a sturdy cardboard box. On his own garage door hefound that the opener reversed when it struck the hard block but crushed acardboard box -- a material that one assumes more closely represents people.;   Gould was able to adjust the opener mechanism on his door so that it wouldreverse on contact with the cardboard container. The test is worthwhile, andif your door fails and you can't make the necessary adjustment, it would be agood idea to call in a professional garage-door-opener repairer.;    Gould'sarticle, &quot;Garage Door Safety&quot; in the magazine's April-May issue, is well worthreading. It contains a garage-door-maintenance check list and safety tips anddiscusses the availability of infrared sensors that will reverse a garage doorbefore it strikes an object. The magazine began appearing on newsstands lastweek.; Q I've faced this problem several times, and although I won't betackling the project again for at least a couple of years I'd like to know ifyou have any suggestions on how to lift a heavy garbage disposal into placebeneath a sink and then attach it. It seems as if three arms are required, oneof which needs to be of weightlifter quality, and there isn't room beneath thesink for a helper and me.; A Next time try using a scissor jack from a smallcar to raise the disposal into place. You might need to build a platform forthe top of the jack, but the time spent on building the platform is usuallyless than the time spent wrestling with a heavy disposal.;    You can prolongthe life of a disposal by never pouring caustic chemicals down the drain andnot grinding up fibrous materials such as corn husks, banana peels, celery,etc., as they can bind internal moving parts so that the only way to restartthe disposal is to disassemble and clean it.; Q I need some square nails foran antique reproduction I'm building. Are they still available?; A Yes.Tremont Nail Co. has been manufacturing nails since 1819 and will ship assmall a quantity as one pound. A catalog is available free by writing to P.O.Box 111, Wareham, Mass. 02571 or phoning (508) 295-0038.; Q Is there an easyway to remove paint from wooden shutters with fixed louvers?; A Yes. Havesomeone else do the work. Shutters, particularly ones with multiple coats ofpaint are tedious to strip. Careful sandblasting will remove the finish butthen you're faced with a lot of finish sanding. You might strip one and equatethe time and materials cost to that of buying a replacement shutter.; Q Wherecan I get information on removing a scratch from a Corian countertop?; AThanks to Melodee Wade of American Home Kitchens in Sunnyvale, you can obtaininstructions from DuPont Co., manufacturers of Corian, by phoning (800)426-7426 and requesting a copy of &quot;Maintaining the Beauty and Elegance ofCorian.&quot;; Feedback: It seems this problem keeps perpetuating itself. In arecent column I mentioned Plasti-Sheen, a liquid that helps to restore thefinish on cultured marble surfaces such as vanity tops and sink bowls. First Idirected readers to the Home Depot stores. They sold out and are notrestocking the product.;    I then gave you the manufacturer's address formail orders. Unfortunately I got one of the digits in the address wrong andthe post office has returned some orders to readers with a notation &quot;not atthis address.&quot; The correct address for the manufacturer of Plasti-Sheen,Glasgow Products Corp., is 3860 Oakcliff Industrial Ct., Atlanta, Ga. 30340.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Owen Whetzel column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910406  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  758  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 6, 199100097180,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
