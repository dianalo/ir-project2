About 15 students told parliamentarian James Karygiannis onMonday that they fear for their families and for their lives if theyreturn to China.   ``I'm scared and worried about my family,'' said one Englishlanguage student. ``I don't know if I will ever be able to see themagain, but I will continue demonstrating because the Chinese peopledo not have any freedom.''   He was among more than 250 people who attended the daylonginformation session the Liberal Party member held to help residentsget work permits or get relatives out of China.   The students said they sent their families photographs ofthemselves protesting against the June 3-4 military assault incentral Beijing and newspaper clippings about unrest in the Chinesecapital.   Police and customs officials opened the packages, said thestudents, who did not want to be identified because they fearedfurther reprisals.   The students also said their families told them not to telephonehome because the lines are tapped and not to return because theywill be imprisoned.   External Affairs Minister Joe Clark on Monday said Canada'sambassador in Beijing was being recalled temporarily to protest theuse of troops against unarmed civilians in China.   China says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly soldiers, in theJune 3-4 assault. But Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence saythe toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
