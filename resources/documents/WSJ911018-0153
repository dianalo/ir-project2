Their pleas should not be heeded.   For decades, Africa was coddled and cradled by a West thatfelt burdened by guilt for colonialism and slavery. Thecontinent has collected more than $300 billion in aid sincethe early 1960s. In the 1980s, Africans, who constitute about12% of the developing world's population, were receivingabout 22% of the West's development assistance. Foreign aidper individual African amounted to $26, as against about $9per Latin American, and $6 per Asian. Omit the Arab countriesof North Africa, and the figure was even higher: $46 perperson in black Africa between 1980 and 1988.</LP><TEXT>   In poor, small countries these sums loom very large. The$8.6 billion poured into Tanzania between 1970 and 1988 ismore than four times that country's 1988 gross domesticproduct. Relative to the size of the economy, it would be asif some kindly donor had given the U.S. $20 trillion, or fourtimes the value of all of Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves.The $9.6 billion given to Sudan over that period is onlyslightly less than one year of that country's annual output.The $5.8 billion that Zaire, Mozambique, Niger, Togo andZambia each received were equivalently huge amounts.   But all that Western aid failed to spur economic growthand lift Africans out of grinding poverty. Sub-Saharan Africais littered with a multitude of &quot;black elephants&quot; (basilicas,grand conference halls, show airports and new capitals) amidinstitutional decay, deteriorating infrastructure andenvironmental degradation.   Above all, Africa's leaders used aid to finance Swiss banksocialism. But while Africa's leaders got rich -- Zaire'sSese Mobutu is said to be worth $10 billion, Zambia's KennethKaunda has been accused of looting up to $6 billion --Africa's people have sunk deeper into poverty. Per-capitaincome in black Africa has steadily dropped through the1980s; by 1988 in Tanzania, to cite one of the starkestexamples, it had dropped to $160, lower than at independencein 1961.   Western sympathy for demands for aid is premised on thenaive presumption that helping African governmentsnecessarily helps the African people. It is more true, as aLesotho chief says: &quot;we have two problems -- rats and thegovernment.&quot;   Free enterprise, free markets, free trade and governmentby consensus were the norm across indigenous Africa.Self-sufficiency and independence were cultural imperatives.&quot;If you rely on somebody for food, you will go withoutbreakfast,&quot; says a proverb of the Fanti people of Ghana.   Even today, Africa could find within itself the resourcesit needs to progress. African governments manage to spend $12billion per year to import arms and maintain theirmilitaries. Elite &quot;bazongas&quot; (raiders of the public treasury)are able to siphon billions of dollars into foreign bankaccounts. The cost of the damage done by Africa's wars isincalculable, but must amount to billions more.   In Bangkok yesterday, the World Bank cautioned thatfinancial assistance to Africa will be cut unless economicreforms are carried out. But, though vital, economic reformalone is not sufficient. Events in Yugoslavia, the SovietUnion and elsewhere have now demonstrated that, withoutbetter governance and a viable democratic political structurein place, economic reform is an exercise in futility.   Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Morocco, Nigeria,Kenya and Togoland have at one time or another been describedas &quot;African economic success stories.&quot; But their economicprospects faded under institutionalized looting and stiffofficial resistance to democratic reform. In Liberia andSomalia, the gains achieved by economic reform underauthoritarian regimes were wiped out in revolutionaryconvulsions. Their ex-leaders' bull-headed refusal to yieldto popular demands for democratic reform was to blame.   Even where economic reform process was not interrupted bypolitical upheaval, the overall achievements in Africa werescarcely spectacular. (Botswana has been the only exception.)In the 1980s, the World Bank provided about $24 billion inloans to 36 African countries for structural adjustmenttoward a market economy. But only Ghana and Tanzania weredeemed &quot;successful performers.&quot; In fact, the World Bankitself concluded in March 1990 that &quot;adjustment lendingappeared to have been relatively less successful insub-Saharan Africa.&quot;   Even in Ghana and Tanzania, however, the sustainability ofeconomic reform is under question. Investment, both foreignand domestic, has sagged and economic forecasts have beenrevised downward. In both countries, the commitment to reformhas been less than sincere. Of Ghana's 195 state-ownedenterprises, fewer than 40 have been privatized, as havefewer than 10 of Tanzania's 400-odd.   Africans are getting fed up. Last month, President RobertMugabe was stunned during a speech when a black Zimbabweanstood up and declared: &quot;Ian Smith was better]&quot; The crowdreportedly cheered the bold heckler as he was dragged off tojail for insulting the president. Across the border in Zambia-- where a state of emergency has been in effect for the past24 years -- a crowd in Lusaka pelted a car carrying thepresident with garbage, chanting &quot;Kaunda walawala&quot; (&quot;Kaundais dead&quot;).   &quot;People everywhere are demonstrating that they will nottolerate the one-party system (and military dictatorship),&quot;said Babacar N'Diaye, president of the African DevelopmentBank, a multilateral lending institution headquartered inAbidjan, Ivory Coast. The West needs to heed this resentmentsweeping Africa or find itself on the wrong side of thecontinent's second liberation struggle.   ---   Mr. Ayittey, a Ghanaian, is associate professor ofeconomics at the American University in Washington, D.C.
