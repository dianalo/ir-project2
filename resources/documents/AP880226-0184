Alan Fiers, a veteran agent who was chief of the agency'sCentral American Task Force, has resigned effective March 4, BillBaker, the agency's spokesman, said Friday.   Fiers was one of several CIA officials involved in theIran-Contra affair who was reprimanded last year by CIA DirectorWilliam Webster because of his role and his failure to informCongress about the activity.   Despite that disciplinary action, Fiers had continued to handleCentral American matters and had briefed members of Congress aspart of the Reagan administration's efforts to win renewed militaryaid for the Contras.   ``It was his personal decision to leave,'' said Baker, whocalled Fiers ``a solid guy'' and confirmed that he had turned downa job as a CIA station chief in an unspecified foreign country.``He said he has other options and is going to take them. Alan hada full career here, and he knew it.''   Baker also said the agency is annoyed at Elliott Abrams, theassistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, who alsowas involved in the administration's clandestine plan to aid theContras at a time when Congress had prohibited such aid.   Abrams, quoted in Friday's New York Times, said Fiers' treatmentby the CIA ``would send exactly the wrong signal to young officersat the agency.''   Abrams was quoted as saying the handling of Fiers case ``says,`Don't get involved in controversial programs because you will endup being punished for it.''' He added: ``He has made a greatcontribution to our interests in Central America and it is aninjustice that he is not being rewarded for it.''   Baker said the agency will complain directly to Abrams aboutwhat he called the impropriety of the remarks.   ``We're very angry at Elliott Abrams,'' he said. ``It's none ofhis business to making comments about case officers and theirfutures.''   Fiers, a former Ohio State football player, spent nearly 21years in the CIA after joining in June 1967. At age 48, Fiers wastwo years short of reaching the CIA's early retirement age andcollecting a substantial pension, said one associate, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Webster reprimanded Fiers late last year after an internal probeof the agency's involvement in the secret sale of U.S. weapons toIran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.The reprimand meant Fiers could not be promoted for at least twoyears, and he apparently saw his career at the agency stalled, thesource said.   After that same investigation, Webster reportedly fired twoofficials _ the former station chief in Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez,and the chief of a large agency base at Aguacate, Honduras. AndClair George, chief of the agency's clandestine service who wascriticized for his role in the affair, retired at the end of lastyear.   During closed-door testimony before the congressionalIran-Contra committees, Fiers acknowledged that he had withheldinformation from Congress about the resupply effort, saying: ``Solong as others who knew the details, as much as I, were keepingtheir silence on that, I was going to keep my silence.''   Fiers remains under investigation as part of the investigationby the government's independent counsel, Lawrence E. Walsh, intothe Iran-Contra scandal.   The CIA has never disclosed Fiers' name or position, but somedetails of his background and career are known. He served as anintelligence officer in Pakistan and later as station chief inSaudi Arabia, which was enlisted by the Reagan administration toprovide $32 million in covert funding for the Contras.   Fiers played right end and tackle under the legendary Ohio Statefootball coach Woody Hayes from 1958 to 1960. He was a biologicalsciences major.   At the CIA, Fiers was credited for skillful work in setting up asystem to make airdrops of supplies to the rebels fighting theleftist Sandinista government.</TEXT></DOC>
