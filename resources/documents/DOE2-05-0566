Fromthe measurements of /sup 131/I a mean dose equivalent of 0.8 +- 0.6 mSvwas calculated for adults. The total body retention of /sup 137/Cs and/sup 134/Cs increased steadily within three months following the accident.Subsequently an equilibrium was reached at a level of 13 to 14 Bq perkg body weight for /sup 137/Cs and 6-7 Bq per kg body weight for /sup134/Cs. The effective dose equivalent calculated on the basis of /sup137/Cs and /sup 134/Cs retentions in 1986 was between 0.04 and 0.10 mSv.</TEXT></DOC>
