The banks' $5.3 billion first-quarter earnings were 4.4% higher than in the first quarter of 1986, reflecting a 12.7% decline in provisions for loan losses from the year before, the FDIC said.    But recent large increases in loan-loss reserves by money-center banks, which hold large loans to Third World countries, are expected to result in &quot;the worst quarter in banking history since the FDIC was created&quot; in 1933, according to FDIC Chairman William Seidman. Major banks have established reserves equal to about 30% of their Third World loans, Mr. Seidman said.    By establishing a large loan-loss reserve, a bank takes a one-time loss in the hope of avoiding a write-off of future loan losses against its income and improving its future profits.    Banks have faced a continual erosion of profits and asset quality since 1981, the FDIC data show. &quot;Each year's decline has been linked to a dominant economic development,&quot; the agency said. &quot;First, there was a recession, followed by a crisis in the agricultural sector. More recently, a collapse in oil prices has led to performance problems. This year, it appears that foreign debt problems will dominate the earnings picture for the industry.&quot;    In the first three months of this year, 54 banks failed, a post-Depression record, and as many as 200 could fail by year's end, Mr. Seidman said. So far, 90 have failed this year. </TEXT></DOC>
