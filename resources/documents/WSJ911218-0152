The accord, signed at a meeting in the Hague, representsan international political commitment allowing Westernindustry to import natural gas and other fossil fuels fromEastern Europe and the Soviet Union's successors in exchangefor financial and technical resources. But many signatoriesagreed that the document offers only a skeletal structure forcooperation.   The signatories will work to complete within a year thebasic accord in areas such as production of hydrocarbon andnuclear fuels. Then attention will shift to longer-termenergy projects.   The charter emphasizes the need for free trade, fairpricing and protection of foreign investment in the energysector.                                                                                                          MOZAMBIQUE'S FINANCIAL SECTOR                                                                                                          Parliament opened Mozambique's financial sector to privateinitiative, passing bills abolishing the state insurancemonopoly, formed in 1977, and making it easier to open banks.The legislation also allows foreign banks to set up branches.Though Maputo never had a formal banking monopoly, only oneprivate bank has operated since the southeast African countrygained independence in 1975.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S TRAFFIC NOISE GROWS                                                                                                          Traffic noise in Japan last year reached the worst levelsever. Environment agency data from slightly more than halfthe 1,585 recording points nationwide showed the noise levelswere at all-time highs from early morning until late atnight, exceeding maximum stan dards. The report blamed anincrease in vehicles last year to 60 million, up 17% from1986, and greater distances driven.                                                                                                          HANOI HAS RED CARPET FOR U.S.                                                                                                          Vietnam is prepared to welcome back U.S. business andreserve it a stake in a big oil field, First Deputy PrimeMinister Phan Van Khai said. He welcomed members of the U.S.Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the first American trademission to visit since 1975. A Washington embargo bans U.S.investment in Vietnam. Mr. Khai favored normalizingU.S.-Vietnamese relations, and emphasized the potential ofVietnam's natural resources, saying Hanoi could designate forU.S. firms the Dai Hung oil field at Vung Tau, east of Ho ChiMinh City.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA'S BUSINESS IMMIGRANTS                                                                                                          Australia unveiled tougher criteria for selecting businessimmigrants. Applicants under the new business-skillscategory, effective Feb. 17, must prove certain experienceand success. They will be graded by business size, age,English-language ability and funds available, with extrapoints for high-priority enterprises such as manufacturing ortechnology. Migrants will be monitored and must meetobjectives within three years.                                                                                                          IS BRITAIN'S RECESSION OVER?                                                                                                          Britain's recession apparently ended during the thirdquarter, the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment said, declaring a &quot;modest recovery&quot; is under way.   In its semiannual Economic Outlook, the Paris-based groupof rich Western nations said Britain's recovery, led byconsumption and exports, may come with &quot;more rapiddisinflation&quot; than expected.   Growth in output of goods and services, constrained byprivate-sector debt, is projected to edge up through nextyear and to increase 1.1% in the second half, cutting theprojected full-year drop to 1.9%. The OECD forecast Britain'sinflation-adjusted growth at 2.2% next year, accelerating toa 3.2% pace in 1993. The government expects output to rise0.75% in the 1991 second half and 2.25% in 1992.   Britain's joblessness will rise next year, the OECDpredicted, though the la bor shakeout that began in late 1990slowed in recent months. Prospects for attaining sustainedlow inflation improved in this quarter as wage settlementsdropped below levels of the early 1980s, when unemploymentwas higher.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Tens of thousands of workers in Greece held a 24-hournational strike to protest government economic austeritymeasures and privatization plans. But strike participationwas the lowest in years. . . . Defying appeals for restraintto retain competitiveness, the German union that represents2.7 million government, rail and postal workers demanded a1992 pay increase of 9.5% and benefits, making the totalboost sought 11%, more than double the inflation rate.</TEXT></DOC>
