The court, by a 5-4 ruling in a case from Detroit, said thegovernment is entitled to certain interest payments on taxes owed bya bankrupt company.   The case stems from a petition filed by Ron Pair Enterprisesbefore a bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984.   The government said the company owed it $53,278 in taxes,penalties and interest accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcypetition.   The company agreed to pay the amount, but refused to payadditional interest accrued after the filing of the petition.   The government said the company should pay the post-filinginterest because the collateral, tax liens on company property, thatsecure the debt owed the government exceed the amount of theoriginal debt.   The Supreme Court today agreed, and overturned a ruling by the6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals against the government.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in his opinion for the court, said thebankruptcy code, which was revised by Congress in 1978, permitpost-filing interest payments in such cases.   The Internal Revenue Service has filed secured claims inbankruptcy proceeding totaling more than $730 million from 1982through 1986, including $186 million in 1986 alone. Federalofficials said state and local governments and private creditorsalso have millions of dollars at stake.   Joining Blackmun were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.Dissenting were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, William J. Brennan,Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.   The case is U.S. vs. Ron Pair, 87-1043.</TEXT></DOC>
