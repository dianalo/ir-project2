LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury in federal court here began deliberations in the trial of two former Anheuser-Busch Cos. executives charged in a kickback scandal.    Joseph E. Martino, Anheuser's former vice president of beer sales, was fired last year following the brewer's internal investigation into alleged kickbacks. He was indicted along with Michael A. Orloff, also a former vice president, on charges of federal mail-fraud and tax-fraud in connection with allegations that they accepted cash and gifts in return for awarding advertising and promotions business.    Messrs. Martino and Orloff, the only current or former Anheuser executives charged, both pleaded innocent. </TEXT></DOC>
