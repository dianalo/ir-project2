Scores of protesters were knocked to the ground, beatenand dragged into police buses.   About 40 people were detained, the official Tass news agencysaid, in what was the harshest crackdown on protesters in Moscow inmore than 1{ years. Tass said the protesters were ``trying tocreate as much disruption as possible, to display anti-Sovietposters and shout anti-Soviet slogans.''   The clashes took place on some of central Moscow's busieststreets and were especially jarring because of the more permissivepolitical climate instituted under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'swide-ranging reforms.   About 1,000 Soviets converged on KGB headquarters at DzerzhinskySquare after dusk to mark the unofficial ``Day of the PoliticalPrisoner'' and mourn the millions who were wrongly imprisoned orkilled under Josef Stalin.   The hour-long protest, in which two rows of people holdingflickering candles lined up on three sides of the building,proceeded peacefully. It had been organized by the MemorialSociety, which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustlyunder Stalin, and the Democratic Union, a self-styled opposition tothe Communist Party.   At the end of the demonstration, a splinter group of about 500people, mostly young men, marched off in the direction of PushkinSquare, a favorite rallying site for human rights activists.   Chanting, ``Shame on the KGB!'' and ``The KGB is the enemy ofthe people!'' the group was confronted without warning by riotpolice two blocks from Pushkin Square as they passed out leafletsto homebound commuters.   The white-helmeted police, armed with long black rubbertruncheons, formed a line, then waded into the protesters, clubbingat least four of their leaders to the ground, then dragging theminto nearby buses for detention.   The demonstrators retreated, then formed again and headed toGorky Street, the main thoroughfare leading to Pushkin Square. Theriot police and other uniformed officers sealed off the square andsplit the protesters into two groups.   On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the demonstrators,taking about six into custody. As the protesters were dragged tothe buses, spectators shouted: ``Shame! Shame!'' Several passers-byspat at a police car.   Another group of demonstrators, gathered on the southeast sideof Pushkin Square, was also repeatedly charged by riot police, whoignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporterswho flocked there.   Police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gatheredunder a Gorky Street archway, and dozens were seized bodily anddragged away to the waiting buses.   It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstrationin Moscow since December 1987, when about 200 burly men in civilianclothes roughed up Jews who staged a protest demanding the right toemigrate on the eve of Gorbachev's departure for his Washingtonsummit with Ronald Reagan.   The 6 p.m. protest outside KGB headquarters began quietly asdozens of regular uniformed police watched the demonstration anddirected traffic around Dzerzhinsky Square. At the center of thesquare is a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Sovietsecret police.   The demonstrators held candles and signs saying, ``Shame on theKGB Executioners'' and ``Down with the KGB.''   They originally had planned to circle the building, which housesthe infamous Lubyanka prison where Soviets declared ``enemies ofthe people'' under Stalin were executed by being shot with a pistolin the back of the head. But police sealed off one side of thebuilding to allow pedestrian and vehicular traffic to pass.</TEXT></DOC>
