The neutron intensity obtained by the spallation reactiondoes not level off even at a proton energy of 3 GeV. The axial neutrondistribution becomes wider with the increasing the proton energy. Theintensity of the thermal neutrons emitted from the moderators is almostsaturated at proton energy of about 2 GeV due to this widening. Therefore,the optimum proton energy to obtain the highest thermal neutron intensityis about 2 GeV.</TEXT></DOC>
