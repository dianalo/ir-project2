Such funds also are hidden by accountants as they ``are notlisted in the accounts of the financial departments of units andare not included in final accounts,'' the People's Daily said.   The State Council, China's legislature, has issued a circularcalling for self-policing by leaders at all levels to root out suchfraud and profiteering.   The reports did not give the estimated value of economic losses,but such corruption, from small-scale price-gouging to massiveembezzlement, is rampant in China.   In October, Shanghai discovered 1,256 ``little coffers''amounting to $7.2 million, the People's Daily said.   Similar funds totaling $13 million were recovered in Hubeiprovince and the city of Tianjin bordering Beijing, and China Oiland Gas Corp. recovered $19 million, the newspaper said.   ``Winning back ill-gotten gains is of crucial value inconsolidating and rectifying the situation, and strengthening theconstruction of a clean and honest government,'' said the circular,reprinted in several newspapers.   Organizations that disclose ``little coffers'' formed by turningpublic money to private gain in their ranks and report toauthorities by Dec. 15 will be treated leniently, the reports said.Those enterprises will be allowed to retain half their ill-gottenprofits, while turning over the other half to the state, it said.   Those which do not turn themselves in, however, must return anymoney they have spent, turn over all illegal profits to the stateand be fined, according to the circular. It added that thesuperiors of those involved also would be held responsible.</TEXT></DOC>
