The new evidence comes from an experiment showing that certain individuals had inherited an inability to develop an immunity to hepatitis following vaccination with Merck andamp; Co.'s hepatitis vaccine.    The confirmation that there are, in fact, human immune response genes opens up a new avenue in research on why individuals vary in their ability to fight off infections or reject organ transplants. The discovery of human immune response genes also could lead to new insight on why some people develop antibodies against their own tissues, causing auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.    The experiment with the hepatitis vaccine was reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine by scientists from a number of medical centers and hospitals in Boston led by Chester A. Alper and his colleagues from the Center for Blood Research.    The experiment was spawned when 598 workers in Boston hospitals, clinics and medical laboratories were vaccinated with Merck's Heptavax-B vaccine for hepatitis B. Such health care workers are at risk of hepatitis B because of their dealings with infected blood.    The Boston researchers found that 4% of the workers failed to develop an immunity to hepatitis, as evidenced by the lack of anti-hepatitis antibodies following three shots of the vaccine.    The researchers then checked the workers for variations in a cluster of related genes known as the major histo-compatibility complex, or MHC. It's long been thought that the genes that control the immune response are hidden in this cluster. But they have never been identified in humans. The researchers found that a higher-than-expected number of the workers who failed to develop anti-hepatitis antibodies had one particular variation in their MHC genes that was rare in the workers successfully vaccinated.    Because they had previously genetically &quot;typed&quot; a large number of people for other research, the scientists knew of four families in which some members also had the unusual variation in the MHC genes. Fourteen members of these families volunteered to be vaccinated with the vaccine.    Five of these 14 volunteers developed either an extremely low level of antibodies to hepatitis B or none at all. All five of these &quot;non-responders&quot; had inherited two copies of the unusual variation in the MHC genes, one copy from each parent.    The remaining nine members of the families were known to have inherited only one copy of the MHC genetic variationfrom either their father or their motherand one copy of a more normal version of the genes. All of these developed a far higher level of antibodies to hepatitis B than the non-responders.    The antibody response followed exactly the pattern of a dominant gene -- that is, it required only one copy of the gene to produce a normal level of antibodies. Conversely, the failure to produce antibodies followed the pattern of a recessive gene in that it required two copies of the genetic variation.    Significantly, the recessive gene prevents the affected people from developing antibodies only to the hepatitis B virus. The volunteers also were given tetanus shots, and all developed normal levels of antibodies to tetanus toxoid. However, four of the volunteers with the genetic variation were allergic to the gluten in wheat, a kind of overreaction of the immune response.    The experiment, plus other evidence, suggests that this or other variations in the same genes may underlie a susceptibility to various auto-immune diseases, the researchers said. </TEXT></DOC>
