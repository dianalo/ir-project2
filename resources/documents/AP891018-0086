He said the the outlawed guerrilla movement would have todemonstrate that it was committed to peaceful negotiations toparticipate in talks between blacks and the government aboutwhite-black power-sharing.   But Viljoen indicated that it would not necessarily have toformally renounce violence, as previously demanded by the whiteminority government.   Despite the apparent concession to guerrilla movement, an ANCofficial in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for the 49-nation Commonwealthsummit called for more sanctions against South Africa's government.   ANC foreign affairs spokesman Thabo Mbeki also said: ``It isvery important ... to pay attention to the question of building upthe military capacity to conduct a sustained armed struggle _ notmerely to carry out an operation once in a while, howeverspectacular.   ``It is more important than a bomb going off here and there,''he said.   Mbeki called on the Commonwealth, an association of Britain andits former colonies, to impose tougher sanctions Africa despite therelease Sunday of Sisulu and seven other longtime politicalprisoners and promises of reform by President F.W. de Klerk.   However, the Rev. Allan Boesak, a founder of South Africa'santi-apartheid United Democratic Front, said he supported the ideaof a six-month moratorium on further sanctions.   Boesak, also in Malaysia, said the deadline should be for therepeal of all discriminatory laws when Parliament convenes earlynext year. The laws range from regulations segregating residentialareas to denying the vote to the black majority.   The Commonwealth's stand on South Africa was a main issue at thesummit, which opened today.   Sisulu, six other African National Congress leaders and a memberof a smaller black nationalist movement were freed unconditionallySunday after lengthy prison terms.   The ANC leaders said they still supported the principle ofviolent resistance, but added that they would encourage ``orderlyand disciplined'' anti-government pressure.   ``It's not because (the ANC) believes in violence for its ownsake. It is because of compelling conditions. Remove the compellingconditions and there will be peace,'' Sisulu said Tuesday inSoweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.   Sisulu, 77, is the highest-ranking of the freed activists andspent 26 years in prison along with his close friend, senior ANCleader Nelson Mandela.   Sisulu said the ANC would be prepared to enter negotiations ifthe government legalizes all banned political organizations, liftsthe 3-year-old state of emergency and releases all politicalprisoners.   De Klerk has said he is reviewing these matters to see whatsteps he might be able to take, and Viljoen expressed willingnessto meet with Sisulu to discuss the demands.</TEXT></DOC>
