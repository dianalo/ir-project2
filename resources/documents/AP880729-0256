The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 14 years, andnew young workers are scarce because of the low birth rates thatprevailed in this country in the 1960s and early 1970s.   Students of population trends say the situation will almostcertainly grow more acute over the next few years.   Retail stores, restaurant chains, supermarkets and many othertypes of businesses are looking to the retired as one source ofhelp for their labor-shortage problem.   What's more, even in an era where reported inflation isrelatively low, many retirees may find that they want or need someextra income.   The match seems perfect. However, says a leading advisory firmon business and financial affairs, retirees are well advised to dosome reckoning before they go out in quest of a new paycheck.   ``Social Security beneficiaries who want to rejoin the workforce should calculate carefully before making the move,'' saysUnited andamp; Babson Investment Report, published in Boston.   As the firm points out, Social Security recipients under age 70who earn money from a job lose $1 in benefits for every $2 of wagesthey receive above specified limits.   At the same time, they must pay income taxes and Social Securitytaxes on their earnings from the job.   ``A working beneficiary could conceivably lose 65 percent ormore of his or her added income,'' United andamp; Babson says.   Of course, the decision to work or not to work in a person'slater years may be influenced by emotional factors as well asfinancial ones.   When a leading graduate business school asked recently at whatage the members of a reunion class would like to retire, a verylarge percentage of those who filled out the questionnaire checked``never.''   Still, it is a sensible idea to figure out beforehand whethertaking a job in your retirement years is going to make you enoughtake-home money to justify the effort.   This year, Social Security recipients between ages 65 and 70begin to lose benefits after their wage and salary earnings exceed$8,400. For those under 65, the cutoff point is $6,120   ``If a retiree goes back to work at a salary significantly abovethe limit, he should request that benefits be suspended,'' United andamp;Babson's analysts advise.   That goes especially for workers 65 to 70 years old, they add,since passing up current benefits will increase the Social Securitypayments they are eligible to receive later on.   All this raises the question of whether the limits onrecipients' earnings serve a useful purpose.   Says United andamp; Babson: ``In the 1930s, when the Social Securitysystem originated, the earnings test (limit) was included as a wayof encouraging older workers to leave the work force to free jobsfor younger people.   ``In recent years the age distribution of the population hasshifted dramatically. Today fewer young workers are entering thework force, and labor shortages are a problem in many cities.   ``Although 20 or so bills seeking the elimination of earningslimits have been filed in Congress, this legislation is notconsidered a high-priority item.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon Aug 1</NOTE></DOC>
