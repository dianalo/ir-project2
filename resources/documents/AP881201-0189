The filmmaker said the woman has ``no credibility.''   Emily Blocker testified Thursday in a hearing at which RandallDale Adams is asking a judge to recommend a retrial of his murdercase. After hearing evidence, state District Judge Larry Baraka willtell the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals whether he believes Adamsdeserves a new trial.   Much of the material being presented in the retrial request wasin the documentary ``The Thin Blue Line.''   ``This man came into my house and told me he was going to make amovie about a police shooting in Dallas,'' Ms. Blocker said offilmmaker Errol Morris.   ``I said I don't exactly remember how everything went down. Hesaid `What the heck? It's just a movie. Anything you don't remember,I'll remember for you,''' Ms. Blocker said.   In the trial following the 1976 murder of policeman Robert Wood,Ms. Blocker told the judge she identified Adams in a lineup. Thedocumentary, though, quoting investigators and interviewing Ms.Blocker, notes that she chose someone else in the lineup.   ``Did you lie to the judge (during the murder trial)?'' defenseattorney Randy Schaffer asked her Thursday.   ``I guess I didn't understand the (judge's) question,'' Ms.Blocker said.   Morris, during a recess in Thursday's testimony, told reportersthat Ms. Blocker's inability to identify Adams in the police lineupwould throw into doubt her identification of Adams at his trial andher testimony.   Morris said Ms. Blocker ``has no credibility whatsoever'' andsaid unedited filmed interviews show she was interviewed ``withoutcoaching and without influence to say anything whatsoever.''   Ms. Blocker also said she believed a lack of evidence, not anyagreement with attorney Doug Mulder, who prosecuted Adams in themurder trial, led to dismissal of a robbery charge against herdaughter.   The charge was dropped five days after Adams was sentenced forthe police shooting, Schaffer said.   Ms. Blocker said her daughter's case ``has nothing to do withthis case. I don't ask for favors.''   John Danish, who represented Ms. Blocker's daughter in therobbery case, acknowledged under questioning from Schaffer that, inhis opinion, there was enough evidence for the robbery case to go tothe jury and that he has seen people sentenced to prison with lessevidence.   ``I don't believe Emily ... ever came out and told me she had aquid-pro-quo arrangement with Doug Mulder ... I can say she gave theimpression this case I was working on was nothing to worry about,''Danish said.   On Wednesday, the first day of the hearing, prisoner David RayHarris recanted his 1977 testimony that Adams killed Wood. Harriswas the only known witness to the slaying.   Although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder,Harris said his finger was on the trigger of the .22-caliber gunthat killed Wood.   Harris, a death row inmate in connection with an unrelatedkilling, said Adams ``knew nothing about this offense and was not inthe car at the time (Wood was shot).''</TEXT></DOC>
