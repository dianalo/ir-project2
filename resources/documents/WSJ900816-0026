Most of the assets to be sold were acquired as part ofImperial's C$5 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc.,completed earlier this year.</LP><TEXT>   Montreal-based Ultramar Canada Inc. agreed to buy the bulkof the assets in the Atlantic Coast provinces, including 199service stations, three marine terminals and a refinery. Thedeal must still be approved by Canadian antitrust regulators.   Imperial Oil, 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., pledged to shedall of Texaco Canada's downstream oil and gas assets inCanada's Atlantic provinces as part of its commitments to theCanadian government's antitrust agency, the Bureau ofCompetition Policy. Those commitments were required beforeregulators would approve the Texaco Canada acquisition.   Imperial wouldn't disclose the price Ultramar agreed topay for the assets, but analysts valued the transaction atabout C$200 million.   Imperial also said it agreed to sell 25 retail gasstations and its other assets in Newfoundland to a privateconsortium, Island Petroleum Co. An additional 96company-owned service stations outside Canada's Atlanticprovinces will be sold to 35 individual bidders, pendinggovernment approval, Imperial said. The company didn'tdisclose the value of those two transactions, which analystssaid could fetch C$100 million.   Profits from these asset sales will help Imperial cut itsdebt load, which soared to C$5.8 billion after the TexacoCanada acquisition. Asset sales, a C$1.3 billion equity issueand cash from operations helped reduce the company's debt toC$3.5 billion by June 30, 1990.   Still on the block are about 300 service stationsthroughout the rest of Canada and between C$500 million andC$750 million of oil and gas producing assets in WesternCanada. These are slated to be sold over the next 18 months.   Dennis Baxter, a spokesman for Imperial declined tospeculate what the remaining downstream assets might fetch,but he said the company has received 529 bids for theremaining service stations.   Mr. Baxter added that Imperial is also getting offers onits upstream production properties, but acknowledged that&quot;that's a very difficult market at the moment.&quot;   Analysts said the acquisition would be a positive move forthe Montreal-based unit of Britain's Ultramar PLC.   &quot;Until now, they've had a minimal exposure in thatmarket,&quot; said Philippe Hervieu, an analyst with NesbittThomson Deacon Inc. in Montreal. &quot;This is a breakthrough forthem.&quot;   Ultramar's acquisition more than doubles the company'sretail outlets in three of the four Atlantic provinces to 337from 138. An Ultramar executive said the company didn't bidfor the Texaco stations in the fourth Atlantic province,Newfoundland, because Ultramar already has 221 outlets there.   The company emerged early as a logical buyer for theassets because antitrust regulators probably wouldn't haveapproved offers by other major integrated oil companies.   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,Imperial Oil closed at C$64, unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
