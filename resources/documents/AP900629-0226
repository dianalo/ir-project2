(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lace is making a comeback as a fashionstaple, but it may be too late to save the industry in New England.   The painstaking tradition of making fine Leavers lace is themost recent New England craft facing extinction. A generation ofweavers who honed their skills for decades are approachingretirement, and mills can't find young workers willing to spendyears learning the craft.   The latest victim is the Deep River Lace Company, which closesits doors today after 56 years in business.   ``It's unfortunate it's coming to an end the way it is,'' saidLeo Denette, 70, one of the mill's four owners who started as anapprentice weaver at Deep River Lace in 1941, six months beforePearl Harbor.   Deep River Lace was the last company in Connecticut and one of ahandful in the country making the intricate, Leavers lace perfectedin Nottingham, England, in the early 1800s.   It takes three years to learn to operate Leavers looms and DeepRiver Lace could find no young people to take the place of its lastfive workers, who are all in their late 60s or early 70s.   So the company is shutting down the last of its 16-ton looms,closing the doors of its red brick factory and becoming a part ofNew England's industrial past.   Stanley Jakiel, 79, another Deep River weaver and owner, tracedthe mill's decline to the casual fashion trends of the 1960s.Demand for lace fell then, so the company never found the need totrain new workers.   ``The lace business went over the falls when ladies startedwearing jeans,'' he says.   Lace-making survives in the United States today, but it hasmoved South and adopted modern technology. A type of cloth calledRachel lace is produced on machines that take only two or threemonths to master.   But Jakiel say Leavers lace is more intricate and better qualitythan the cheaper Rachel variety.   ``It really takes 20 years before you know what you're doing,''said Jakiel, who has been in the lace business for 60 years. ``It'sall experience, there's no book on this.''   The huge Leavers machines stand 9 feet 6 inches tall and are ofa design essentially unchanged from the prototype built by JohnLeavers, an English lace worker in 1813.   Each loom contains 4,600 bobbins, which have to be threadedindividually with thread as fine as a strand of hair. The threadsare woven into lace by the rocking bobbins and metal bars thatdetermine the pattern.   Only about 150 Leavers looms are still in use in the UnitedStates, compared with 800 in the late 1940s and early 1950s, saidJohn W. Hughes, manager of the textile engineering division ofBridgeport-based American Fabrics Co.   More will fall silent when Rhode Island Lace Works in GreatBarrington, R.I., closes its doors in August.   Hughes helped build two of Deep River Lace's cast iron loomsmore than 30 years ago when he was an apprentice in Nottingham.   Today, he brokers the sale of old machines, like the four DeepRiver Lace looms that already have been shipped to mills in Calais,France.   Hughes says the craft is alive and well in Europe and Japan,where apprentices are eager to learn how to operate the complicatedlooms and designers are placing big orders.   ``Lace is the hottest item in fashion right now,'' says LitaKonde, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in NewYork City.   ``Today, the European lace houses can't even keep their ordersfilled,'' she said. ``The dress designers are using it everythingfrom cocktail and evening wear to swimsuits.''   France has always been the leader in lace production and Frenchfashion houses like Christian Dior and Yves St. Laurent haveincorporated the fabric into their spring and fall lines, Kondesaid.   But the latest fashion craze won't benefit Deep River Lace. Theowners' only hope now is to preserve the mill as a museum.   ``Certain old-fashioned values should not be forgotten,'' saidCharlotte D. Boline, who is trying to sell the mill to the state asa museum. ``The traditions of New England should be carried on soour children can see how things were done.''</TEXT></DOC>
