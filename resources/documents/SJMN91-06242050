COPS: MOTORMAN ADMITS DRINKING  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Ray, who could not be found until six hours after the crash, was chargedWednesday with five counts of second-degree manslaughter. Police said Ray'sblood-alcohol content was 0.21 percent, more than twice the state's legallevel of intoxication in driving a car.;   Although authorities found a vialwith traces of cocaine in the motorman's compartment, investigators playeddown a drug link to the accident while awaiting test results.;   Five peoplewere killed and more than 200 injured when the train jumped a switch trackjust north of the 14th Street-Union Square station in Manhattan at 12:10 a.m.The 10-car train carrying about 500 passengers rattled against machinery andwalls, hammered pillars into images of broken ribs and collapsed into atwisted mass of shiny stainless steel, plastic orange seats, wire and glass.;  One side of the first car sheared like a can when it smacked into machinery,opening a gaping gash. The car ripped in two, with the front end hurtling downthe tracks at least 120 feet. The rear portion was unrecognizable, crushedagainst the wall like an aluminum can. The third car in the train was squeezedlike an accordion, wrapped around pillar supports and the next two zigzaggedacross the tracks.;   An accident investigator said most of the people whodied were passengers who had been ejected from the first car.;   &quot;One of thedead persons was actually on top of the second car,&quot; said Capt. James Ciullaof the New York City Fire Department, adding the victim apparently wascatapulted from the first car.;   Those who died in the crash were all NewYorkers leaving or going to work.;   The wreck knocked out subway service for400,000 commuters.;   Ray escaped without injury in the worst train wrecksince 16 people were killed and 100 hurt in 1928.;   A rider, Clarence Thomas,57, said Ray remained in the motorman's cab for five minutes after the crashwhile passengers in the crippled front car yelled at him. Thomas, who filednotice that he plans to sue over the accident, said the motorman did notemerge until rescuers arrived.;   A transit officer who saw the motormanshortly after the accident reported he looked &quot;dazed.&quot; Police later learnedthat Ray went upstairs to Union Square, which was clogged with ambulances andcovered with people on stretchers, and quietly watched from the park. He waspicked up by police about 6 a.m. as he arrived at his home.;   Before thecrash, the train had been driven so erratically that the conductor warned Raythat he would complain to the Transportation Authority command center, theconductor told police.;   &quot;Don't worry, I'm all right,&quot; Ray had responded,according to police.;   Transit Authority President Alan Kiepper said Ray hadbeen tested twice for drugs, once in June 1988, as required upon his promotionto motorman, and again Jan. 15, 1991, when he was suspended in an accident inwhich he ran a red signal. The tests were negative, Kiepper said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Newsday  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910829  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  575  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 29, 199100242050,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
