(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state legislator has proposed a fineof $1 against anyone convicted of assaulting a flag-burner, in whata civil rights activist called an invitation to violence.   State Rep. Shelby Rhinehart, the Democrat who filed the bill,said it was intended to limit punishment for those who reactviolently to flag burning.   ``It'll protect a lot of old veterans if they attack someoneburning a flag. They won't be punished severely,'' said Rhinehart.   The bill condones violence, said Hedy Weinberg, executivedirector of the Tennessee chapter of the American Civil LibertiesUnion.   ``I wouldn't even question the constitutionality at thispoint,'' she said. ``I think what's more disturbing is therationale and logic behind it. What he's doing in fact is giving insome sense permission to veterans. .. to become violent.''   Legal questions aside, she wondered if there was any need forthe bill.   ``I've been in Tennessee five years, and I've never heard of anyflag-burning incidents,'' Ms. Weinberg said.   The bill is one of several to be considered by the statelegislature next year that deal with flag-burning. The SupremeCourt ruled several months ago that such action is a protected formof expression, prompting Congress to pass a bill that prohibitsdesecration of the flag. </TEXT></DOC>
