Foster, a professor in the department of bioengineering atthe University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.andP;  According to the Macworldarticle, Foster is one of several experts cited by Apple officials inresponse to inquiries about the issue.andM;While manufacturers were quick to point out that the emissions problem isneither new nor specific to Macintosh displays, they are already planning totighten safety guidelines.andP;  Apple officials said the company is &quot;currentlyinvestigating ways to lower emissions levels&quot; and listed improved circuitboard design, phosphor surface coatings and metallic shieldings as possibleways to reduce ELF emissions.andM;Officials at SuperMac Technology in Sunnyvale, Calif., said they plan toparticipate in a consortium of monitor makers on the issue.andP;  Meetings amongseveral manufacturers will begin this week.andM;&quot;This is a real issue, and I want a non-competitive atmosphere to plan aconsortium with [other manufacturers], including IBM, and then get Sony andHitachi in here to do something about it,&quot; said Steven Blank, vice presidentof marketing at SuperMac.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
