Japan ended restrictions on tourism and culturalexchanges, and will no longer prohibit its officials fromtraveling on South African airlines.   But in Geneva, the International Labor Organization votedto continue sanctions against South Africa, saying most ofapartheid's fundamentals remain intact. The group representsgovernments, employers and trade unions in 148 countries. Thevote was 317-2, with U.S. delegates dissenting, to maintainthe restrictions until South Africa is a fully democraticsociety and blacks get the right to vote.   South Africa's parliament amended a law that allowedindefinite detentions by police and was a main tool againstanti-apartheid activists for three decades. The changerequires charges to be filed within 10 days of an arrest.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINES JOBLESS PROSPECTS                                                                                                          The Philippine government, struggling to provide relief totens of thousands of refugees after the Mount Pinatubovolcanic eruptions, said more than 600,000 people, mainlyagricultural and service workers, may be out of jobs becauseof the disaster, adding to the 2.2 million people alreadyunemployed nationwide.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA TO REPLACE CURRENCY                                                                                                          Argentina early next year will replace the austral with acurrency unit called the peso that will be valued at $1,Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said. The peso will beArgentina's fifth currency in 22 years. Inflation devaluedthe other four to near insignificance. The peso will chopfour zeros off the austral; 10,000 of them now buy $1. Theaustral was valued at $1.20 on its introduction in June 1985.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA TIGHTENS REGULATIONS                                                                                                          The Australian government tightened accounting policiesand strengthened insider-trading regulation. Last January'snational companies and securities legislation was intended toincrease compliance and ensure proper standards of corporatebehavior. The new changes by parliament provide forconsolidated reporting, designed to stop abuses such asdisguising companies' financial positions, which Canberrasaid contributed to a lack of investor confidence. They alsomake corporations and partnerships subject to insider-tradinglegislation.                                                                                                          EC LEADER DECRIES FARM POLICY                                                                                                          A European Community leader denounced the EC's farm policyas a failure and urged U.S. and Japanese support for a newone. Martin Bangemann, a vice president of the EC Commissionand former West German economics minister, said the ECexecutive body's proposed policy concentrates on helpingsmall, individual farmers in the 12-member bloc. Currentpolicy fixes prices for farm products and limits importsthrough a tariff system. Critics say the high prices favorbig, wealthy farmers who don't need them.                                                                                                          LAOS ENTERS THE JET AGE                                                                                                          Laos's national airline has acquired its first jet. LaoAviation said it will use the Soviet-built TU-154M forservice to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. Laos also recentlyestablished air links with Burma. The impoverished country,with few links to the outside world, has been trying to woomore tourists in a bid to earn hard currency. Laos attracted6,400 foreign visitors last year, when the national tourismcompany earned about $1 million, up 47% from a year earlier.                                                                                                          U.N. REPORTS ON `WORLD'S WOMEN'                                                                                                          In every country world-wide, women face some form ofdiscrimination, which prevents them from achieving their fullpotential, according to a United Nations report, &quot;The World'sWomen 1970-1990.&quot;   The report is the first attempt to merge data on womenglobally from U.N. agencies dealing with economic and socialaffairs, children, population and women in poor nations.&quot;Although there have been some improvements for women overthe past 20 years, the majority still lag far behind men inpower, wealth and opportunity,&quot; Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar wrote.   Many improvements for women in employment, education andhealth care could be reversed in the 1990s because ofeconomic recession, the study found. Women, it says,accounted for 41% of the work force world-wide and are thefirst to suffer from job contractions. In non-agriculturalfields, women were paid an average of 30% to 40% less thanmen.   Among the study's highlights: Segregation by sex wascommon. Deteriorating economies and living standards indeveloping regions threaten women's gains in health,childbearing and education. Women gained in health andeducation in North Africa and the Mideast, but facedworkplace bias. Leaders in women's employment and politicalparticipation included the Scandinavian countries, the SovietUnion and Eastern Europe.
