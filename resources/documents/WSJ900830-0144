Dodge, the forecasting unitof McGraw-Hill Inc.   Dodge said setbacks in all segments in July resulted in anannualized construction startup rate of $232.31 billion, downfrom $244.85 billion in June. The seasonally adjusted ratebrought the Dodge index down to 148 from 156 the previousmonth. The index compares current contracting with a 1982base of 100.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Restrictive credit, budget austerity, and a stagnanteconomy are more than enough reasons for the sorry state ofconstruction in 1990,&quot; said George A. Christie, vicepresident and chief economist for Dodge. Energy inflation isan added impediment to improvement in the near future.   The weakest segment, nonresidential building, dropped 8%to $80.5 billion, as a result of lagging office construction,which fell 23% to the lowest rate in a decade. Nonbuildingconstruction, including public works and utilities, was down7% to $42.4 billion, and homebuilding was down 2% to $109.4billion.   Through seven months of 1990, $143 billion of newconstruction was started, 8% less than the comparable 1989period. The most severe regional declines continued to be inthe Northeast, down 24%, and the Southeast, down 15% throughJuly.   ---                                   a-July '90    Seasonally                                  Construction   Adjusted %                                  Contract Val.
