Lousewort population biology is affected twoways by the disturbance regime of the St. John's River. First, ice scourand bank slumping have caused high overwinter mortality and local populationextinction, especially on saturated or wet soil. Such disturbances arethe primary threat to both individuals and populations. Second, continuedlack of disturbance, which allows successional changes (high vegetationcover and dominance by woody species) also reduces survival, growth,recruitment, germination, and seedling survivorship. Conservation tacticsshould include protection of extant populations and maintenance of anextensive wooded riverine corridor, thus providing potential habitatwithin a natural hydrological disturbance regime.</TEXT></DOC>
