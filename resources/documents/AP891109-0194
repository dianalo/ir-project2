Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said thatalthough it was not the Soviet Union's place to comment on anothercountry's internal affairs, it was clear East Germany wasundertaking a ``renewal of socialism.''   ``They're improving the situation in the sense that they'removing toward perestroika on their own terms,'' he told a newsbriefing, referring to the reforms President Mikhail S. Gorbachevbegan on coming to power in 1985.   Millions of Soviets learned in TV, radio and newspaper reportsof the dramatic overhaul of East Germany's ruling Politburo and newleader Egon Krenz's promises of democratic reforms.   The official news agency Tass quickly reported that the EastGerman government had thrown open all borders and that its citizenscould travel or emigrate anywhere.   Vyacheslav Mostovoy, a correspondent reporting on Soviettelevision's widely watched nightly news program Vremya, said EastGermany's Central Committee had begun mapping political andeconomic reforms in a ``program which the whole country awaits andon which the future of the republic largely depends.''   Mostovoy, reporting from East Germany, stressed the elevation ofreformers to the Politburo. He quoted Krenz as saying in a speechthat the East German communist party leadership had earlier taken anegative approach to changes in the Soviet Union and othersocialist countries.   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, had been cool toGorbachev's reforms and resisted implementing them in his owncountry. But Krenz told Gorbachev in a telephone call last monththat ``there are important lessons to be learned from Sovietperestroika in the German Democratic Republic.''   During a visit to Moscow, Krenz discussed possible applicationsin East Germany of Soviet-style reforms.   ``We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process ofperestroika in the Soviet Union,'' he told reporters, adding heespecially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism ``moreattractive.''   In its reports on East German developments, Radio Moscow focusedon that government's plans for a party conference and Krenz's callfor more democracy.   Tass issued at least four reports. One report said the changesthe Central Committee is discussing ``came from the street'' andthat the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern.   Tass ran excerpts of Krenz's 86-page speech Wednesday to theCentral Committee, highlighting his remarks on the formergovernment's hostility toward the Soviet reforms.   It quoted Krenz's condemnation of the old Politburo's ``negativewait-and-see attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude toprocesses taking place in the Soviet Union and other socialistcountries.''   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia also gave readersdetails of Krenz's speech and reported the continuing mass exodusof East Germans.   On Wednesday, Vremya showed Mostovoy standing against thebackdrop of an outdoor public protest in Berlin and describing the``exceptionally important political events'' in East Germany thisweek.   ``The process of reform and renewal that started just a fewweeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness,'' Mostovoy said ina report of about three minutes that came halfway through the45-minute show.   Mostovoy praised the East German press for ``covering events indetail and objectively'' and noted that thousands of people leftthe country in the past day as part of the continuing exodus toWest Germany.   Pravda carried a brief report on East Germany, listing the newcomposition of the Politburo and noting the government's appeals tocitizens to keep the country functioning normally.</TEXT></DOC>
