The amendment to the Bush administration's bill tooverhaul the banking system is another example ofcongressional determination to prevent federal bankregulators from reimbursing uninsured depositors when a bankfails.</LP><TEXT>   Treasury officials said the panel went too far in limitinggovernment discretion to control shocks to the financialsystem. Although the amendment will probably be revised, thestrong support shown for the provision makes it likely thatCongress will continue to insist on significant restrictionson the coverage of foreign deposits.   On another issue, the Treasury and the banking industrydefeated a big effort by the National Association ofRealtors, whose political action committee contributed $3.1million to members of Congress in the 1990 elections, to keepstate-chartered banks out of the real estate brokeragebusiness. Passage of the amendment would have hurt theprospects for the administration's bill by encouraging aflood of other special-interest amendments.   Federal deposit insurance covers domestic accounts up to$100,000, but as part of a doctrine called &quot;too big to fail&quot;the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sometimes ends upcovering all deposits -- domestic accounts above $100,000 andforeign deposits that aren't insured -- to avoid disruptingthe financial system. The most recent case in which thedoctrine was applied was that of the now-defunct Bank of NewEngland.   The doctrine has emerged as a symbol of unfairness,because it means that depositors in big banks, failures ofwhich could trigger financial shock waves, are essentiallyprotected from loss, while depositors in more expendablesmaller banks aren't. &quot;We have to deal with this inequity,&quot;argued Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.).   The Federal Reserve Board has tried to avoid shaking theconfidence of foreign depositors in U.S. banks because manylarge U.S. banks fund their operations with money raisedabroad. At the end of last year, 51% of the deposits of thenine largest U.S. banks came from abroad. Traditionally,Citibank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and a few other of thenation's largest banks have raised most of their depositsabroad. While banks currently pay a deposit insurance premiumof 19.5 cents on each $100 of deposits, they pay no premiumon foreign deposits.   Last week, the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of theHouse Banking Committee voted to bar the FDIC fromreimbursing any uninsured deposits, starting in 1995.Yesterday, the panel went further in its efforts to shrinkthe insurance safety net. It voted 35-0 to prevent any U.S.agency, including the Federal Reserve, from paying foreigndepositors.   Most bank failures don't involve institutions that thegovernment judges too big to fail. Nevertheless, foreign andother uninsured depositors are protected in such failures,because the FDIC arranges for a healthy bank to purchase thefailed bank and assume all the deposits. The amendment byRep. Paul Kanjorski (D., Pa.) would block coverage of foreigndeposits in such transactions.   Both the Treasury and the Fed oppose measures thateliminate their ability to deal with potential &quot;systemicrisks&quot; to the nation's financial structure, and the argumentover the too big to fail doctrine is far from over. Rep.Peter Hoagland (D., Neb.) warned that as the banking billcontinues down its legislative track, Congress will have tofind some way to narrow the doctrine without taking away thegovernment's ability to protect the safety and soundness ofthe banking system.   An amendment on behalf of the credit union industry passedon a 23-11 vote, despite an attack by Rep. Gerald Kleczka(D., Wis.). The amendment, sponsored by panel Chairman Rep.Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), blocked a Treasury proposal toforce credit unions to write off over 12 years a bigcontribution they made to the National Credit Union ShareInsurance Fund. The industry complained that writing off thecontribution, now carried as an asset on credit union books,would be too costly.   When the panel reconvenes Tuesday, it will face a seriesof issues that pit the banking industry against thesecurities and insurance industries. It may also have to voteon a proposal by Mr. Schumer to limit interest rates bankscan pay to attract deposits -- a proposal banks stronglyoppose.</TEXT></DOC>
