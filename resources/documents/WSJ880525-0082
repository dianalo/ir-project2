For all their efforts, the leap from hope to hard orders is likely to be long in coming. But the two aircraft makers view the interest being shown by several East European countries in their products as a possible wedge into a vast market.    Indeed, the very fact that Boeing, Airbus and a third company, McDonnell Douglas Corp., are holding talks with the East bloc governments opens up possibilities that didn't exist in the days when the airlines of the region were expected to buy whatever noisy, fuel-guzzling, unreliable plane rolled off Soviet assembly lines. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's economic reforms have made their mark, as Moscow's allies follow its lead in squeezing state airline subsidies and in giving management wider freedom to choose what equipment to buy.    Boeing is by far the most optimistic about the East bloc, saying it could sell as many as 100 aircraft to carriers in Romania, Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Yugoslavia by the year 2000. Airbus agrees with more conservative forecasts that two or three East bloc airlines will lease a total of 10 to 12 Western-built planes in the next decade. And that would be only to bridge the gap between current fleet needs and availability of new Soviet jetliners.    &quot;It will be a bit like China,&quot; says one aviation specialist familiar with the region. &quot;Everybody will rush in {to the East bloc countries} with proposals and then not get very far.&quot; According to another source familiar with Airbus, the thinking inside the European consortium is: &quot;We'll get East Germany and Boeing will get Poland and the rest will be extremely tough.&quot;    The biggest carrier of all, the Soviet Union's Aeroflot, which flew some 120 million passengers last year, is unlikely to buy anything from the West. The Soviets want to progress in aerospace technology and need customers for their output. The Czech and Bulgarian carriers aren't expected to buy Boeings or Airbuses either, and the three Yugoslav airlines already have mostly Western fleets.    So the &quot;new&quot; market revolves around four medium to small carriers: East Germany's Interflug, LOT Polish Airlines, Tarom Romanian Airlines and Malev Hungarian Airlines.    Despite the unexciting prospects, the three largest Western plane makers are pitching hard. Even if they can't make a lot of money right now, they seem determined to gain a toehold in hopes of making bigger sales in the long term.    Airbus and Boeing appear to be the farthest along and have already made sales proposals before the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls, or Cocom, which must approve transfers of Western technology to Soviet bloc countries. Diplomats have indicated the proposals will be approved if maintenance of engines and other sensitive parts is carried out in the West.    As previously reported, Interflug wants to lease two $60 million Airbus A-310 twin-engine wide-bodies for its tourism flights to Cuba and Africa. Although the carrier is expected to be in line for the new generation of Soviet-built planes, experts think it wants to enhance its money-making holiday business in the meantime.    Boeing is negotiating with LOT about a long-term lease of three 767s, says Rudy Hillinga, Boeing's sales director for Eastern Europe. But Airbus entered the fray with an offer for A-310s, and now both plane makers are awaiting a decision by the Polish government and clearance from Cocom, according to Mr. Hillinga.    Tarom, the Romanian carrier, is interested in three 767s and options for three more, Mr. Hillinga says, but is studying A-310s as well. Malev of Hungary is considering 737s and McDonnell Douglas MD87s.    It is hardly surprising that these carriers are at least looking at safe, fuel-efficient planes that could attract hard-currency-paying passengers and would actually produce profits for the airlines. A year ago, a New York-bound LOT Ilyushin-62 crashed outside Warsaw, killing all 183 on board. That accident, plus Gorbachev-inspired revelations in the Soviet press about accidents in the Soviet Union, heightened fears in the West about the reliability of Soviet-built planes. As a result, Western tourists and business executives turned to other carriers that serve the region, such as Lufthansa and Pan American World Airways.    Another reason for East bloc carriers to look West is the tightening of noise restrictions at U.S. and Western European airports. Two new Soviet jetliners that are supposed to be introduced in the early 1990s -- the four-engine, long-range Ilyushin-96 and the twin-engined, medium-range Tupolev-204 -- are expected to meet the more stringent standards. But Aeroflot will probably receive the new models first, forcing the other East bloc carriers to wait.    There are economic advantages to waiting. Soviet planes can be bartered or paid for with local currency. Airbuses and Boeings must be paid for in dollars. {Most of the transactions now under discussion involve the purchase of the aircraft by Western financing consortiums that would lease the planes long-term to the carriers.}   Sticking with Soviet planes is the politically easier path for East bloc carriers. Soviet Transport Minister Apollon Systsov, who led a delegation to the Hanover Air Show earlier this month, told Aviation Week andamp; Space Technology magazine that he had &quot;a strong negative position&quot; about the negotiations LOT and Interflug are having with Western plane builders. Although he said &quot;we must respect the wishes of these governments,&quot; that attitude could always change -- and quickly. </TEXT></DOC>
