SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, endorsed by theCommunist Party for prime minister, is both head of Poland's policeforces and initiator of talks with the Solidarity union that he wasresponsible for suppressing.   State media announced Monday the Polish United Workers(Communist) Party has backed Kiszczak for prime minister to succeednew party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.   If Kiszczak is also supported by the minor partners in thecommunist coalition, the Peasant and Democratic parties, then hiselection by the parliament would seem assured. But in Poland'schanging political landscape, nothing could be ruled out.   Once a shadowy figure best known for his crackdowns ondissidents, Kiszczak emerged as a valuable negotiating partner forthe opposition in two months of talks that resulted in Solidarity'slegalization and partially free elections.   The 63-year-old army general, who has been Interior Ministersince 1981, donned a civilian suit for the talks and often drovehis red Peugeot to a palace in downtown Warsaw where negotiationswere held.   With a mixture of charm and toughness, Kiszczak quicklyimpressed union negotiators. He disarmed underground writers bypraising their essays, which his investigators had presumablyconfiscated.   It was Kiszczak who made the proposal for talks with theopposition on political and economic reform a year ago during awave of nationwide strikes, Poland's worst labor unrest in sevenyears.   Walesa refused to commit Solidarity to talks without a pledgethat the union would be legalized. In a dramatic reversal,Jaruzelski pushed through an offer to restore the union's legalstatus at a party plenum in January.   Three weeks later, as chief negotiator for the government side,Kiszczak opened the round table. Agreements reached April 5 led tolegalization of Solidarity and partially free elections in whichSolidarity scored dazzling victories July 4 and July 18.   But Kiszczak was one of 33 out of 35 top government and partyofficials who ran unopposed on a national slate but failed to getthe required 50 percent of votes cast.   Kiszczak's relations with the opposition were not always socordial.   Along with Jaruzelski and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki,Kiszczak helped execute the December 1981 martial-law crackdown inwhich thousands of Solidarity activists were rounded up andimprisoned.   Three years later, Interior Ministry security police on hispayroll murdered the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidaritypriest who had kept the ethos of the union alive in monthly Massesfor the homeland at his Warsaw parish.   Kiszczak saw that the four officers were convicted of murder,but the trial stopped short of revealing any higher-levelinvolvement, which some opposition members still suspect.   As head of the ministry responsible for containing theopposition which flourished underground after martial law, Kiszczakdeveloped a deep knowledge of Solidarity.   One leading Solidarity activist who has spent years in jail foropposition activity recently joked that one of the best collectionsof underground literature can be found in the ministry's basement.   Born in 1925, Kiszczak's war experiences contributed to theevolution of a tough young officer.   Shipped by the Nazis to work as a forced laborer in thesouthwestern city of Wroclaw, then known by its German name ofBreslau, Kiszczak escaped and made his way to communist resistanceforces in Austria.   He joined the Communist Party in 1945 and helped in the campaignagainst Polish partisans opposed to the imposition of communistrule.   Kiszczak later attende the Voroshilov Academy of the Sovietarmed forces in Moscow and was promoted to general in 1973. Heserved as head of military intelligence between 1972 and 1979 andhead of the military police in the Ministry of National Defensebetween 1979 and 1981.   Jaruzelski named Kiszczak head of the Interior Ministry inAugust 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
