Mr. Bush invoked his support for the Persian Gulf War,which Mr. Buchanan opposed, but his biggest salvos were onthe subject of Social Security. &quot;I don't think SocialSecurity ought to be voluntary,&quot; the president declared whilecampaigning here, and he pointedly urged voters to &quot;go ask{Mr. Buchanan} what he thinks about it.&quot; The White House thencited a nine-year-old Buchanan newspaper column that raisedthe issue of making Social Security voluntary.</LP><TEXT>   Top Bush aides joined in the attack. &quot;Buchanan has been infavor of voluntary Social Security,&quot; campaign chairman RobertTeeter said. Mr. Teeter also pointedly warned Mr. Buchanan tobe prepared for a debate on last year's war with Iraq.   Mr. Buchanan shrugged off the Bush campaign's charge byinsisting, &quot;The Social Security system is not going to betouched or changed by anybody.&quot; And the Buchanan camp seemedready to bring fresh ammunition to the battle. Although todate most of the challenger's criticisms have focused on theeconomy, aides yesterday signaled their intention to assailMr. Bush in the Bible Belt on such issues as permittingfederal funds to subsidize &quot;pornographic&quot; art.   Mr. Bush's 53%-37% victory margin, based on official NewHampshire primary results, touched off a round of GOPsecond-guessing covering everything from the caliber of Mr.Bush's TV commercials to his lackluster performance on thestump to the content of his economic stimulus program.   Despite White House efforts to put the best face on Mr.Bush's victory, the immediate upshot of thebetter-than-expected Buchanan showing is the likelihood of aprotracted GOP primary campaign that will force Mr. Bushtoward the right, reduce further his leverage with theDemocratic Congress, and ratchet up partisan warfare inWashington. One probable short-term casualty is the hope of aquick compromise with Democrats on a tax-cut bill tostimulate the economy.   In Knoxville, Mr. Bush himself complained that hisdecision to withhold a middle-class tax cut from the &quot;actionplan&quot; he presented to Congress, which drew heavy fire fromMr. Buchanan and Democratic candidates alike, had been&quot;grossly misinterpreted.&quot; Mr. Teeter said a Buchanantelevision ad on the subject was &quot;a lie.&quot;   In the commercial that so riled Mr. Teeter, Mr. Buchananlikened Mr. Bush's decision to postpone action on amiddleclass tax cut until later this year to his earlierdecision to disregard his &quot;no new taxes&quot; pledge from the 1988campaign.   The president in his late January State of the Unionmessage proposed a major tax package, including a $500increase in the personal exemption that a taxpayer can takefor each child. This is something that &quot;we can do rightaway,&quot; he declared.   But a week later he and leading congressional Republicansdecided to keep the increased personal exemption out of hisshort-term &quot;action plan,&quot; which focused instead on a cut inthe capital gains tax rate, accelerated business write-offs,and real estate tax breaks.   The Bush campaign's immediate task is to blunt Mr.Buchanan's momentum in Georgia and Maryland, where thechallenger has focused his post-New Hampshire efforts. Mr.Teeter insisted that Mr. Buchanan reached his &quot;high watermark&quot; in New Hampshire, and one prominent independent analystof Southern politics agreed. &quot;If {Buchanan} gets 30%&quot; of theGOP vote in Georgia &quot;it would be considered good,&quot; saidAtlanta-based pollster Claibourne Darden.   The Bush campaign hopes to reel off a string of 15consecutive victories through the March 10 Super Tuesdayprimaries, progressively diminishing Mr. Buchanan's impact.But the challenger could still exact a price by softening upMr. Bush's support among conservatives. &quot;The coalitions thatwe put together in the 1980s for Reagan are starting to breakup,&quot; said GOP strategist Ed Rollins. With a bad economyreturning many so-called Reagan Democrats to their partisanroots, Mr. Rollins added, Mr. Bush can't afford to loseanything from the conservative base.   It's clear that Mr. Bush's standing with the Republicanright is shaky. &quot;People just don't believe him,&quot; saidconservative activist Donald Devine. &quot;What he has to do nowis restore his credibility.&quot;   But administration officials insist there is no prospectthat Mr. Bush will yield to conservatives' most ardentdemand, that he jettison his two top economic policyofficials, Budget Director Richard Darman and TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady. While aides expect Mr. Bush topitch for conservative support by increasing rhetoricalemphasis on such themes as welfare overhaul, educationalchoice and congressional term limits, the economy is easilythe biggest campaign issue.   Bush campaign advisers were divided on possible tacticaladjustments. Some close to the campaign grumbled privatelyabout the quality of its TV commercials and predicted thatMr. Teeter may soon move to overhaul his media team, perhapswith assistance from Roger Ailes, who made Mr. Bush's 1988commercials but bowed out of the 1992 campaign two monthsago. The White House has already announced a freneticschedule of campaign appearances for Mr. Bush in SuperTuesday primary states over the next three weeks.   Yet &quot;it would be a mistake to overreact,&quot; cautioned MitchDaniels, a former Reagan White House political director. Mr.Bush &quot;needs to handle it with some grace and aplomb&quot; and &quot;laythis off basically to local factors. All of America does notlook like New Hampshire.&quot;   ---   Jill Abramson in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
