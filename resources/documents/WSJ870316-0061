GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAMMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Democratic-controlled Congress is attempting to stop President Reagan's support for the Nicaraguan Contras, but legislators aren't clear on what policy they would substitute in its place.    Most lawmakers voting against further funding for the rebels battling Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government subscribe to a vague notion of &quot;containment.&quot; They would end U.S. backing of the Contras in exchange for Sandinista political reforms or, at least, Managua's promise not to export revolution to neighboring countries.    Lurking behind this shaky framework is the implied commitment that the U.S. would guarantee the security of its Central American allies -- with American soldiers if needed -- if the Sandinistas violate their word. The containment policy also assumes that Managua would negotiate even without continued U.S. pressure.    What's remarkable about such an idea is that it comes at a time when there is broad agreement in Congress that the Sandinistas can't be trusted. Earlier in the Reagan administration, only the hardliners held such a view; now, even Democrats who consistently vote against Contra aid agree.    &quot;No, I don't trust them. Deeds are greater than words, and they haven't displayed anything that would lead us to trust them,&quot; says Rep. Matthew Martinez (D., Calif.), who voted with the House majority last week to embargo $40 million in already approved aid for the rebels.    To be sure, the administration's policy is also ambiguous, if not inconsistent. It says it supports the Contras to pressure the Sandinista government into negotiations with its domestic political opponents and neighboring countries. But despite the periodic appointment of special envoys to the region, the White House seems more interested in toppling the regime than negotiating with it.    The containment policy isn't any more promising. It has worked well in places like South Korea and West Germany, where the symbolic presence of American troops has signaled to the Soviet Union that aggression won't be tolerated. But there is even less political consensus for maintaining a permanent U.S. military presence in Central America than there is to continue supporting the Contras.    The U.S. already has treaty commitments under which it would consult and come to the aid of Latin American allies under attack. An aide to Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), who supported Contra aid last year but now opposes it, says that the U.S. would respond if &quot;Nicaragua exercised the military option.&quot; But it isn't likely there would be support either here or in Central America for a U.S. military response to low-level Nicaraguan interference with its neighbors, such as support for leftist insurgents.    Containment also is costly. Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), a Contra supporter, estimates that providing additional economic and military aid to bolster the other states in the region and for verification that Nicaragua wasn't interfering with its neighbors could cost $2 billion to $3 billion over several years. A Pentagon official last year pegged the figure at twice that amount. In a time of U.S. budget cutting, such additional spending would be difficult.    Administration officials also note that the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America, chaired by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, concluded in 1984 that if the U.S. simply tried to contain Nicaragua, &quot;there would be little incentive for the Sandinistas to act responsibly.&quot;    The administration's opponents disagree. They say the Sandinistas use the civil war against the Contras as an excuse to avoid negotiations on relaxing domestic political restrictions. Rep. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.), a Contra opponent who heads the congressional Hispanic Caucus, says that during a trip to Nicaragua this month Sandinista officials &quot;told me that they're willing to negotiate with the U.S.&quot; and &quot;are willing to negotiate changes of the political structure in Nicaragua.&quot;    The administration's critics also say the Contras are a corrupt fighting force whose leaders have as little interest in bringing democracy to Nicaragua as the Sandinistas appear to.    The key test of what view will prevail comes later this year, when Congress votes on the administration's request for $105 million for the Contras for next year. Last week's House approval of a &quot;moratorium&quot; on $40 million in current-year aid until the administration accounts for past spending, permitted House members to sidestep the tough decision of whether to end Contra funding altogether. The Senate vote on withholding the $40 million will be close. If the Senate does block the funds, President Reagan will veto the measure, and Congress isn't expected to be able to overturn the veto. </TEXT></DOC>
