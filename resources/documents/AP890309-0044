(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A marine biologist has begun a five-daysojourn in a sealed environment that generates its own air and rain,part of an experiment that creators say may work as well on distantplanets as in the Arizona desert.   Abigale Alling entered the unnamed module Wednesday through anairlock, abandoning Earth's atmosphere for one created to test thesystems of Biosphere II, a futuristic, closed ecosystem which won'tbe completed for about 15 months.   ``I will live, move and breathe in another life system,'' Ms.Alling said before she entered the airlock. She later told reportersover a videotape hookup that she felt like a pioneer.   ``It is another world, and a world apart from where you are. Itis a remarkable feat,'' she said.   Researchers from the Soviet Union have experimented withnon-food-producing closed systems, and the University of Hawaii haskept a closed experiment going for 20 years, but no one hasintegrated natural processes into a long-term habitat capable ofsustaining human life, project director Margaret Augustine said.   That is the mission of Biosphere II, which will provide a worldwithin a world for eight ``biospherians'' from September 1990 untilSeptember 1992, she said.   Biosphere II will feature desert, ocean, farmed land, marsh,savanna and jungle ``biomes,'' or life zones, with 250 animalspecies ranging from goats to insects and 3,800 plant species. Thehuman habitat, listed as another biome, will include laboratoriesand an amphitheater in a six-story building resembling a mosque.   Ms. Augustine and other officers of Space Biospheres Ventures, aprivate company largely funded by Texas oilman Edward P. Bass,expect the $30 million project to pay for itself in sales ofbiospheres to governments and researchers for space colonization,preservation of endangered species or other projects.   Ms. Alling said her experiment will be the longest test so far ahuman-inhabited module cut off from Earth's atmosphere and foodchains.   There have been 2{ years of unmanned studies in the test moduleand a three-day manned study.   The Yale University-trained biologist wore a red jumpsuit as sheentered the enclosure, a greenhouse about the size of a single-cargarage at the base but topped with a glass-and-steel canopy thatmakes it 20 feet high and traps 15,000 cubic feet of air.   The module, stocked with flora and fauna as well as a privatequarters for Ms. Alling, is a fraction of the size of Biosphere II,which will put 5 million cubic feet under glass over a 2{-acre site.But planners expect this week's experiment to prove the worth oftheir calculations that plants, organisms and solar-poweredequipment can purify the air and water and replenish the oxygensupply of the biospherians.   ``The import of this thing is monumental'' because of informationto be gathered, said Linda Leigh, a design coordinator.   The small enclosure kept Ms. Alling's world devoid of chickens,goats and other vertebrates expected to populate Biosphere II.   However, Ms. Alling said she would have no trouble dining on2,500 calories a day from 29 types of fruit and vegetables, as wellas two aquarium fish which she will kill and eat as part of the test.   Air circulation works on a system similar to Biosphere II's: Hotair will rise over the desert section of the module, pick upmoisture over a 1 million-gallon ocean and release it as rain over arain forest. Solar fans and a turbine will send air back over thedesert to begin the cycle again.   Ms. Alling, a 29-year-old marine-mammal scientist, will monitorsystems inside while project managers outside do the same, as wellas record Ms. Alling's heart and respiration rate and other vitalsigns.   She has already learned to enjoy the enclosed environment, whichshe said ``has the wonderful smell of a rich tropical rain forest.''</TEXT></DOC>
