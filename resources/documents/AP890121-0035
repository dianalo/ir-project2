GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The military government blamed lawlessnessfor delaying free elections, and official sources said balloting toend more than a quarter-century of one-party rule might not takeplace until 1990.   ``We need peace and tranquility in the country. If there is nolaw and order, how can we have elections?'' said Brig. Gen. KhinNyunt, ranked No. 2 in a military council that has ruled Burma sinceit seized power Sept. 18 and brutally put down a nationwide uprising.   The general did not specify Friday what disorder the nation wasexperiencing, and there has been no known resurgence of violentprotest since the government, by its count, killed 500 people afterthe takeover.   Western diplomats say about 1,000 were killed and dispute thegovernment's claim that most of those killed were looters and``destructive elements'' _ not pro-democracy demonstrators.   Khin Nyunt told a news conference the government would keepschools closed, maintain a curfew and continue restrictions onopposition parties being mentioned in the state controlled media.   ``Further opening will come slowly,'' he said.   He repeatedly denied the government had arrested, tortured orexecuted student activists who had returned from border areas afterfleeing the military repression.   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International claimedearlier this month that students returning from the Thai-Burmeseborder had been arrested. The U.S. State Department said it had``credible reports'' that some returnees had been executed.   Rangoon says about 2,000 students and others who participated inpro-democracy demonstrations last year have returned home, amongthem 320 repatriated under a Thai government-sponsored program.   Shunned by the international community, including former aiddonors Japan and West Germany, the military has attempted to improveits tarnished rights image.   The news conference came at the end of a three-day, four-citytrip arranged for 46 foreign correspondents, who interviewed nearly150 repatriated students and some of their parents.   Burmese officials could not recall such a large foreign presspresence since the country gained independence from Britain in 1948.   Speaking with the authorities present, most students deniedknowledge of arrests or lengthy interrogations although a few saidthey knew of some returning activists who were detained.   Among students the government assembled for the journalists inthe city of Taunggyi were Myo Win Htun and Kyi Moe, whom Amnesty hadsaid were feared arrested.   Myo Win Htun charged Thai authorities had exerted ``psychologicalpressure'' on him and some colleagues to return to Burma from aspecial repatriation center. He said he was forced to dig cesspoolsand cut down trees. He went on a hunger strike to protest his return.   Thailand has said that all students returned voluntarily from itsborder center.   ``We were not molested but we're uncertain about our situation,''said Aung Htu, a 26-year-old student from Meiktila. He and virtuallyall others expressed their support for a democractic system and freeelections.   Khin Nyunt said he could not specify the date of elections to endone-party rule that began in 1962.   But official sources said these would probably not take placeuntil late this year or 1990. While the military had not set apolling date, Western analysts had speculated they would be heldbefore mid-1989.   To date, 182 political parties have registered with the electioncommission.   Khim Nyunt, secretary of the State Law and Order RestorationCouncil, acknowledged that authorities were detaining some people,including lawyer Nay Min and political satirist Thu Ra, on chargesof inciting insurrection and endangering national unity during theuprisings.   But he denied Nay Min and Thu Ra had been tortured or poorlytreated in detention.   Uprisings last year prompted the resignation of Ne Win, who tookover in a 1962 military coup. Pro-democracy protests by hundreds ofthousands of people forced the resignation of his successor and ledto the sacking of another by the military.</TEXT></DOC>
