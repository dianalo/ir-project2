The negotiators, who met Monday, are considering the areas wherethe rebels, known as Contras, will gather during the cease-fire,which is to begin Friday under the peace accord signed last week inSapoa.   After about two hours of discussions Monday, the talks wererecessed until today, and rebel leaders said there remainedobstacles.   High-level talks aimed at reaching a more permanent truce arescheduled for April 6 in Managua, the capital.   The leader of the Sandinista delegation, Maj. Gen. JoaquinCuadra, deputy defense minister and army chief of staff, toldreporters on Monday: ``We come with the same spirit, will anddecision of the first meeting.''   Leading the U.S.-backed Contras was Aristides Sanchez, adirector of the umbrella Nicaraguan Resistance alliance. He toldreporters the rebels presented their plan to the government.   The rebel representatives included Walter Calderon, a formernational guardsman now known as Commander Tono; Luis Moreno Payan,who uses the name Commander Mike Lima and is chief of Contramilitary intelligence; Luis Fley, or Commander Johnson, chief ofrebel operations in northern Nicaragua, and Diogenes Hernandez, acommander whose units operate in central Nicaragua.   After Monday's meeting, Hernandez told a news conference, ``Iwant to tell the Nicaraguan people and the world that the (rebel)combatants are not going to put down their arms until Nicaragua isa democracy.''   He said Defense Minister Humberto Ortega proposed last week thata Marxist democracy be established, but Hernandez said the Contraswant ``a real democracy like Costa Rica.''   Cuadra declined to respond to Hernandez's remarks and saidMonday's talks dealt with the ``mechanics of the meeting.'' He saidthe rebels made no proposals to define the zones where the Contraswould gather under a truce.   ``We are hoping for an agreement before April 1,'' he added.   A temporary cease-fire has been effect since March 21.   Cuadra said there had been ``violations of the truce of a minorcharacter, but we understand that they are due to thecommunications problem.''   Sanchez said that in a few days the rebels will free theSandinistas they are holding captive. He did not give details.   Others in the Sandinista delegation were Deputy Foreign MinisterVictor Hugo Tinoco and military intelligence chief Maj. RicardoWheelock Roman.   On Sunday, the leftist Sandinista government fulfilled the firstpart of the cease-fire accord by freeing 100 political prisonersunder an amnesty program. Most of them were accused of activitieslinked to the Contras.   Under the Sapoa agreement, rebel forces are to gather withoutinterference from Sandinista forces in specified zones insideNicaragua during the first two weeks of April. Monday's talksbetween special commissions of the two sides could be extended andwere to define ``the location, size and modus operandi'' of thosezones, according to the text of the Sapoa accord.   Nothing is said in the Sapoa agreement about the Contras layingdown their arms. In past talks, the rebels insisted on keepingtheir weapons until all provisions of an accord were carried out.   Once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones, the Contraleadership can send up to eight delegates to participate innational reconciliation talks on April 6.   Last week's pact provides a gradual amnesty for Nicaragua's3,300 political prisoners, guarantees freedom of expression, andpermits all exiles to return home and participate in the politicalprocess.</TEXT></DOC>
