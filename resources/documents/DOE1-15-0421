The RING program for these simulationsis an improved version of the one presented in an other report. The self-consistenttreatment of the R.F. extraction zone is added to it, together with thepossibility to vary initial conditions to better describe the laser illuminationand the electron extraction from cathode. Plane or curved cathodes areused.</TEXT></DOC>
