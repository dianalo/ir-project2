The applicant requests authority to import Canadiangas from Dome for sale on both a firm and an interruptible basis undera long-term gas purchase contract negotiated with Northern States Power(NSP) on November 1, 1987. NSP, a Minnesota corporation located in St.Paul, distributes natural gas and electricity to the Minnesota, Wisconsin,and North and South Dakota region. Under the terms of an April 7, 1986,gas sales agreement between Dome Petroleum and Dome, the Canadian parentagrees to supply the gas applicant is obligated to provide under agreementswith U.S. buyers, including NSP, and the applicant agrees to remit thefull proceeds, less its expenses, to Dome. According to the explicit terms of its November 1, 1987, agreement withNSP, submitted as part of the application, Dome Petroleum would continueto provide NSP with up to 15,000 Mcf per day of gas imported under itsexisting blanket authorization granted October 30, 1987, in DOE/ERA Opinionand Order No. 204 (ERA Docket No. 87-30-NG) pending regulatory approvalof its proposed long-term arrangement. Dome Petroleum states in its requestthat long-term firm deliveries to NSP are scheduled to commence on November1, 1988, or on the date all necessary regulatory approvals are received,for a term of 13 years. The contract specifically calls for maximum dailygas deliveries of up to 15,000 Mcf based on a 75 percent load factor overthe life of the agreement. In addition to these firm supplies, Dome Petroleumrequests authority to import additional interruptible Canadian gas volumesof up to 20,000 Mcf per day over the same 13 year contract period. DomePetroleum states that NSP's minimum purchase obligation would be 10,000Mcf of gas per day for each winter period (November through April) and1,090,000 Mcf in total for each summer period (May through October). Thecontract contains a provision giving NSP the right to make up any deficienttakings under the existing agreement for a period of two contract yearssubsequent to the deficient taking. Both firm and interruptible gas supplies would be sold to NSP in accordancewith a two-part, demand/commodity rate structure. The initial commoditycharge would be $1.07 per MMBtu and the demand charge would be $214,440per month, based on deliveries of 15,000 Mcf per day on an anticipated75 percent load factor. As further provided by Dome Petroleum's August18, 1988, supplement to its August 8, 1988, application, the commodityprice for interruptible volumes sold to NSP would vary from month to monthdepending on surplus availability, the competitiveness of alternate supplysources, and overall natural gas market conditions. Dome's supplementalfiling also provides that NSP would reserve the option to accept or rejectthe monthly asking price for any interruptible supplies that Dome Petroleummay offer. The contract accompanying Dome's application indicates that NSP's demandand commodity charges can be renegotiated annually within 60 days of theend of each contract year. Further, if the delivered price of the gas atthe contract load factor results in the total cost per MMBtu of the gasexceeding $.20 (U.S.) less than NSP's current delivered cost of gas perMMBtu purchased from Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern Natural) thenDome Petroleum, within 60 days after receiving notice from NSP, would haveto adjust its price so that the total price NSP pays is at least $.20 (U.S.)less than NSP would pay Northern Natural for alternate service on a firm,non-interruptible basis. The contract also states that there would be aminimum commodity charge imposed if the average spot gas price deliveredinto Northern Natural's system over a three-month period exceeded DomePetroleum's delivered price to NSP by more than $.38 per MMBtu (as reportedin the trade press). However, the gas purchase agreement filed as partof Dome Petroleum's application contains a provision that NSP would nothave to pay the minimum commodity charge by serving 60 days notice to Dome.In addition to copies of its gas purchase agreements with Dome and NSP,Dome Petroleum's application includes precedent letters for long-term transportationservice from Saskatchewan Power Corporation (Saskatchewan Power), NOVA(an Alberta corporation), TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada),and an acknowledgment from NSP that it is seeking an extension of firmservice from Midwestern Gas Transmission Company (Midwestern) which transportsgas for NSP on its northern system. Dome Petroleum states that Canadiangas volumes gathered in Saskatchewan would be delivered to TransCanada'ssystem at Bayhurst, Saskatchewan, by Saskatchewan Power, while Albertavolumes included in the import authorization would be delivered by NOVAto TransCanada's interconnection at Empress, Alberta. The gas would thenbe transported by TransCanada to the international border near Emerson,Manitoba, for import to the U.S. The appliant indicates that Midwesternwould be responsible for redelivering the import volumes from the U.S.border to NSP's system. Dome Petroleum's application further indicatesthat the pipleline facilities needed to transport the gas from the U.S./Canadianborder are currently in place. In support of its application, Dome Petroleum states that approval of itslong-term import request is in the public interest not only because ofits market sensitive pricing, but also because access to firm and interruptibleCanadian gas supplies will help NSP to expand its existing supply sourcesto meet its system demand and reduce undue dependence on the limited numberof suppliers in its service area. According to the application, NSP isdependent upon Northern Natural for approximately 85 percent of its gassupplies. Last, Dome Petroleum avers that, as the marketing subsidiaryof one of Canada's largest oil and natural gas suppliers having accessto approximately 785 Bcf of uncontracted reserves, its gas supply sourcewill be secure over the term of the agreement.The decision on this application will be made consistent with the DOE'sgas import policy guidelines, under which the competitiveness of an importarrangement in the markets served is the primary consideration in determiningwhether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Partiesthat may oppose this application should comment in their responses on theissue of competitiveness as set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is competitive. Parties opposing thearrangement bear the burden of overcoming this assertion.All parties should be aware that if the ERA approves this requested long-termimport, it may condition the authorization on the filing of quarterly reportsto facilitate ERA monitoring of its natural gas import and export program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments.
