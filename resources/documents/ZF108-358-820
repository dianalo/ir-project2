 Its opening comment: &quot;Televisionadvertising doesn't work any more.andP;  What's next?&quot;andM;We've said that the three big markets for interactive multimedia aretraining, training and training.andP;  Once everyone understood the concept (andthe joke) we coined the acronym TIE for Training, Instruction and Education.andO;We believe TIE is the No.andP;  1 market in terms of growth potential based on thegovernment estimate that public and private TIE accounts for 7 percent of theU.S.andP;  Gross National Product -- $300 billion to $500 billion.andP;  But we arebeginning to believe that the No.andP;  2 market may start to accelerate with oreven before TIE.andM;POS, POP, POI, TIEandM;Point of Sale, Point of Purchase, and Point of Information are very similarin concept and execution.andP;  They are also similar to TIE presentations.andP;  Ifyou think of sales as training a client to buy your product, there is nodifference.andM;From the interactive producer's perspective, the big (and important)difference is that TIE systems are normally marketed based on increasedtraining efficiency.andP;  They're purchased to reduce costs by achieving aneducational goal that had been reached previously through manpower-intensivemeans.andM;Training, in industry, is usually seen as a cost.andP;  The investment inrelatively expensive interactive equipment must offset some competingexpense.andM;It's a tough sale, very hard to prove that the tradeoffs will really tradeoff unless you're talking about aircraft crew or nuclear technician training,where the cost of even a minor screw-up could be catastrophic.andP;  In somecases, interactive training systems are justified by reducing the cost oftravel time for instructors, or the cost of scheduling required courses foremployees with tight time constraints.andP;  But these clear-cut cases arerelatively few.andM;On the other hand, if it can be demonstrated that interactive multimedia willincrease sales and revenues ...andP;  Well, selling to a profit center isrelatively easy.andM;The ability of interactive programs to capture a student's or clienthsattention with video and high-quality sound and get them involved areidentical first requirements in education and sales.andP;  How many things haveyou learned or bought that you had no interest in?andM;We think marketing leaders will battle for mindshare with interactivemultimedia programs.andM;Where?andP;  What products?andP;  What environments?andM;The easy answers first: interactive multimedia sales systems are easiest tojustify for high-cost items or services with complex or multiple concepts ofuse, in an un-rushed setting, or in environments where many similar productsor services compete.andM;Probably the easiest environment is a waiting room.andP;  Where else do peoplewillingly read five-year-old New Yorkers and Readers Digests?andM;One of the applications we know is in a surgeon's office, where the doctoruses an interactive multimedia application to get &quot;informed consent&quot; frompatients before performing an operation.andP;  This cross between training andsales uses animation to lead the patient through a proposed surgicalprocedure.andP;  The patient is shown what it entails, the intended result andwhat hazards exist.andP;  As the prospective patient goes through the program, hisunderstanding is tested and recorded.andP;  Supplemental segments are shown asnecessary to achieve understanding.andP;  Finally, with very little of thesurgeon's valuable time expended, the patient is ready to sign a statementwith full knowledge of what the risks and rewards are.andP;  (In the event of amalpractice suit, the results of the tests will defuse the&quot;He-never-told-me-I-could-lose-that!&quot; legal assault.)andM;In addition to the training to avoid malpractice considerations, medical andprofessional applications from audiology to veterinary medicine have the mixof complexity, personal involvement, and time available (as well as profitmargin) to be successful target markets for point of sale/point ofinformation systems.andM;The next time you take your pet to the vet, your kid to the pediatrician orget a new set of bifocals, check out the posters and pamphlets and see howmany subjects these professionals want you to know about and products andservices they are trying to sell of the newly (and passively) informedclient.andM;Which tire to buy?andP;  What additional services should I look at while I'mbuying tires, a muffler or getting a tune-up?andP;  Take a look in any Goodyearstore and look at what they are trying to sell with posters, stacks of tiresand models of suspension systems and little alignment machines.andP;  Much of theservice that is sold is decided on after the client is in the store,sometimes after the work has commenced on the car.andP;  There's a highlycompetitive sales environment in the store, but there's usually a waitingroom.andP;  A consumer who could inform himself could also sell himself while hewaited.andM;Biggest market might not workandM;The biggest market is the toughest market.andP;  It's the supermarket.andP;  How tocapture a few consumer mind-seconds during the act of shopping, when adecision to buy items from certain product categories has already been made?andO;There are many simple devices at work there now, but they are alltwo-dimensional and static and usually involve discounts.andP;  It's ahigh-volume, low-margin business, not very complex, but very high-speed.andO;It's a tough place to convince a customer to &quot;play&quot; with an interactivemultimedia machine.andM;Some early point of sale/point of information applications were modestlysuccessful, but most did not fulfill the hoped-for result of sales withoutsales staff -- again, the cost-reduction concept.andM;We don't know any TIE application that attempt to train without teachers.andO;Why should marketing programs work independently of human intelligence?andM;We believe that many successful applications will be salesmen's tools,machines that can be used to stretch the sales professional's knowledge andaccess to information.andM;Sales may or may not be an art, but we know that the best sales people don'toperate using only either- or choices, nor multiple choice questions, to findout what a customer wants.andP;  Communications experts tell us that about 80percent of a potential customer's message is conveyed in tone of voice andbody-language.andP;  The remaining 20 percent is full of inference and hiddenmeaning.andP;  Those are tough interpretations for a point of sale rig tounderstand and act on.andP;  That's a human job, for now.andM;How many things can a personal computer do for a small business?andP;  Too manyfor most sales people to remember.andP;  For example, in a typical Businesslandstore, it's difficult, if not impossible, for a salesman to know all thecapabilities and specs and be able to describe all the machines and software.andO;When the right point of sale gear is in place, the salesman's three mostimportant functions may become:andM;* Determining which interactive multimedia programs the customer should see;andM;* Analyzing the customer's needs based on conversation and customer's inputsduring the program;andM;* Closing the sale.andM;WTWe don't think machines are going to close many high-ticket sales bythemselves, but a sales force armed with complete information about itsproducts and the competition's, as well as an ability to demonstrate the mostcomplex products and processes with animation and video will be successful.andM;SAM doesn't do it allandM;A point of sale machine will function as a sales associate, a Sales AssociateMachine (yes, time for a new acronym, introducing SAM!).andM;We think that there will be a dearth of bells and whistles on the nextgeneration of successful Sales Associate Machines.andP;  They probably won't betied to the home office mainframe to track inventory or consumerdemographics--a couple of selling points of current and recent offerings.andO;They'll be very straight-forward sales education tools, and, if theultra-high-ticket direct sales forces are going to use them, SAMs will weighunder 25 pounds and have a carrying strap.andM;To compete in high volume markets, we think a full-up system (includingsoftware) will cost less than $10,000.andP;  One of the keys to making suchsystems portable will be the development of high-quality flat-panel colordisplays.andM;SAMs will skew ad agency priorities, create requirements for new authoringsystems and produce a high-volume commercial market that today's strugglingmultimedia producers have been praying for.andP;  SAMs will also create newopportunity for sales trainers and consultants to chart efficient strategiesfor implementation for the pioneer companies.andM;Strategic AlliancesandM;One of the serious problems we anticipate is that the companies that createthe various &quot;wares&quot; (particularly salesware) are not particularly adept atsales themselves.andP;  Just having a subject matter expert, which seems tosuffice in TIE, may not complete the marketing equation for SAM.andP;  We thinkthat Exis, the recently announced alliance of Claris and Peat Marwick (Clarisdeveloping a high-powered database and executive information systems and PeatMarwick, a well-respected management consulting firm that knows how to usethese programs) is a model that would-be SAM producers and marketers shouldstudy carefully.andP;  If the POS designers and marketers learn the lesson,someone will have to figure out where to put a wrist on SAM -- for his prizeRolex.andM;Dan Ryder is vice president of Multimedia Computing Corp.andP;  We're consideringreviving a project that we discussed with a number of industry executiveslast year -- creation of a point-of-sale CD-ROM with &quot;salesware&quot; to accompanyit.andP;  If your company is interested in participating, please call Dan at (408)245-4750.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
