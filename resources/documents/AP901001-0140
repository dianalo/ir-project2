(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic gubernatorial candidate TheoMitchell refused Monday to apologize for derogatory comments aboutblacks who support GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell.   Mitchell, a state senator seeking to become South Carolina'sfirst black governor, said he has no plans to retract his commentseven though it may cost him the opportunity to debate Campbellbefore the general election.   ``At this point in time, I see nothing to apologize for unlessit can be shown there's a reason,'' Mitchell said in a telephoneinterview with The Associated Press. He said he would elaborate onthe controversy at a news conference Tuesday.   Within the past two weeks, Campbell has won the endorsement ofthe predominantly black African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church andthe South Carolina Conference of Black Mayors.   Last week, Mitchell lashed out at the Rev. Richard Fisher,bishop of the AME Zion Church, and five black mayors who announcedtheir support of Campbell.   ``These are house niggers. ... These are Uncle Toms. These areblack prostitutes who are still being bought by white politicians,selling out their people,'' Mitchell said during a radio program.   Campbell and Mitchell were scheduled for a one-hour debate Oct.22. But one day after Mitchell's comments, Campbell pulled out ofthe debate.   ``I'm not about to give him a forum for his vitriolic diatribethat has come forth,'' Campbell said. The governor said he wouldreconsider the debate if Mitchell retracted the statements andapologized.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><HEAD>Poll Shows Voinovich Leading By 11 Points in Ohio Governor's Race</HEAD><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A statewide poll released Monday showedRepublican George Voinovich leading Democrat Anthony J.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight state attorneys general on Mondaycomplained to President Bush about a Republican fund-raising schemethey compared to ``mail-order frauds and telemarketing scams.''   In a letter to Bush, the attorneys general objected to a programunder which the Republican Presidential Task Force mailed $25checks to more than a million potential campaign contributors.   The task force asks recipients to deposit the checks in theirchecking accounts to test a new Republican fund-raising procedure.Cashing the checks authorizes the GOP to deduct $12.50 a month fromthe recipients' checking accounts indefinitely unless consumerstake steps to halt the payments.   ``This solicitation marks a shameful low in the history ofAmerican campaigning,'' the attorneys general wrote to Bush. ``Itreduces the political process to the level of integrity normallyassociated with fly-by-night con artists, mail frauds andtelemarketing scams.''   Besides Abrams, the attorneys general of Minnesota, Oregon,Alabama, North Dakota, Connecticut, Michigan and Illinois signedthe letter.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Oregon Supreme Court has restored fiveinitiative measures to the Nov. 6 ballot, reversing a lower courtruling that had disqualified them on a technicality.   In a secondary ruling, the Supreme Court upheld lower courtdecisions that had struck financial impact statements from threemeasures on grounds officials missed a deadline for approving them.   State law requires that financial estimates be printed onballots and in the state Voter's Pamphlet for measures having asubstantial impact on the state treasury.   Two Marion County judges ruled that fiscal statements for threemeasures were invalid because state officials approved them after alegal deadline. Election officials had removed fiscal statementsfrom five other measures because they were handled under the sameprocedures.   The result was that as many as eight of the 11 statewidemeasures on the general election ballot were in jeopardy because ofthe legal tangle.   Elections officials have said the financial effects statementsmight be posted in voting booths as a substitute for having them onthe ballot or in the Voters' Pamphlet.   The Supreme Court announced its unanimous decision Friday afterhearing oral arguments and had no further comment, saying writtenopinions would be issued later.</TEXT><TEXT/></DOC>
