Fractional O{sub 3} uptake was measured in the respiratorytract of awake Fischer 344 rats and in the lungs and nasopharynx of younghealthy male humans. Awake animals were individually evaluated duringnose only exposures to 0.3 ppm O{sub 3} for O{sub 3} removal, O{sub 2}consumption, CO{sub 2} production and tidal breathing while inside abody plethysmograph. Utilizing these values of O{sub 3} uptake and measuresof ventilation, the mass dose rate of O{sub 3} per unit respiratory tractsurface area was computed and found to be similar between rats and humansfor the same ambient O{sub 3} concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
