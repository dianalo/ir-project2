He has been making up for it ever since.    &quot;Bubbie!&quot; Mr. Scanlon is shouting into the phone. As one of the nation's top public-relations agents, he is entitled to talk like that. &quot;Where's your aunt?&quot;    The aunt is feminist Betty Friedan, and Mr. Scanlon, 52, needs to talk to her because a former client, Cooper Union, wants her as a commencement speaker. But he can't chat long; he has other important calls to make. One of them is to former client Ted Hughes -- &quot;the poet laureate of England and a friend of mine&quot;-- whom he phones to invite himself as a house guest. Then, he must talk to the florist, to send flowers to an executive at client Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who just gave birth. And there is Time art critic Robert Hughes, whom he calls to pitch a story about client Dominique de Menil, a wealthy art collector. &quot;Dominique has two daughters who are close friends of mine and my wife,&quot; Mr. Scanlon confides.    It is hard to keep Mr. Scanlon quiet these days. His clients are high-profile, his PR tactics sometimes more so. He helped turn public opinion favorable toward CBS Inc. in its libel battle with retired Gen. William Westmoreland. He represented Philippine President Corazon Aquino, gratis, during her successful campaign to overturn Ferdinand Marcos. He helped burnish the Boston Globe's image when it was sued for libel by Massachusetts gubernatorial hopeful John Lakian, who claimed that a Globe story falsely suggested that he had lied about his background.    And now he has been hired by Drexel, the investment banker, and by Laurence Tisch, the chief executive of CBS. For different reasons, both have big-league image problems. Drexel is one of the most visible targets of a government insider-trading investigation. Mr. Tisch has drawn fire for budget cutbacks at CBS News.    A plump and white-bearded Irishman with an endless supply of jokes and stories, Mr. Scanlon is best known for practicing public relations with histrionic flair. When the Globe was sued for libel, he mocked the plaintiff's lawyer, Norman Roy Grutman and his team, calling them &quot;Roy Boy and the Dittos.&quot; While representing CBS in the Westmoreland case, Mr. Scanlon some days garnered more headlines for himself and his visible PR tactics than for his client.    His style may endear him to friends, but he has passionate detractors. &quot;Scanlon strikes me as someone who doesn't know how to shut up,&quot; says Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a Yale Law School professor who specializes in professional ethics. He says the attention Mr. Scanlon has drawn to himself will &quot;diminish the value of subsequent PR.&quot;    Those who have been on the wrong end of Mr. Scanlon's spirited PR campaigns also complain about him. Daniel M. Burt, who represented Gen. Westmoreland in the CBS suit, says Mr. Scanlon &quot;has got all the tact of an ape at a Chinese tea party.&quot;    Mr. Scanlon's style doesn't always sit well with those on his own side, either. At CBS, associates of Mr. Tisch were infuriated by a USA Today article in which &quot;public relations whiz&quot; Mr. Scanlon was credited with talking Mr. Tisch into doing a &quot;public relations show&quot; at a recent broadcasting convention. Says an associate of Mr. Tisch: &quot;A good PR guy, you should never hear about.&quot;    Mr. Scanlon says he didn't talk to USA Today and didn't plant the story.    Some people say there is tension at Drexel, too. At Drexel's recent junk-bond conference in Los Angeles, the company's internal PR department ran around keeping an eye on reporters and answering questions. Mr. Scanlon, meanwhile, went to lunch with his daughter and attended a movie screening. (He says that he was in Los Angeles for Drexel's meeting as an observer, not to handle the press, and that he isn't aware of any tension between himself and Drexel.)    But taking care of the big picture, not the drudgery, typifies the Scanlon method. He socializes with his powerful clients and contacts in journalism and sets himself up as an adviser to both. He plays softball near his Sag Harbor, N.Y., country house with writer Ken Auletta and Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner of U.S. News andamp; World Report and a sometime client of Mr. Scanlon's. He talks of dinner parties with ABC newsman Peter Jennings and get-togethers with Felix Rohatyn, managing partner of Lazard Freres andamp; Co. Mr. Rohatyn is also a former client.    Some of Mr. Scanlon's business conversations could be confused with cocktail-party chatter, as when he recently pitched a story to Time's Mr. Hughes.    &quot;I'm getting sick and tired of hearing brilliant reviews of your book!&quot; he teases Mr. Hughes on the phone. &quot;I feel honored I was in on the book six or eight months prior.&quot; His voice turns conspiratorial. &quot;You know this rumor that you're going to the New Yorker? . . . It would be a brilliant choice for them. Lord knows, the magazine needs it.&quot;    After a few minutes of chitchat, he casually slips in: &quot;I'm working with Dominique de Menil on, you know, the opening of the collection in Houston. . . . So you do intend to cover it? Oh, good.&quot; His tone quickly turns social again, as he asks after Mr. Hughes's personal life and how many copies the book has sold. &quot;So you're figuring mid-May? Good, we'll send you the materials.&quot;    Mr. Hughes, interviewed later, says Mr. Scanlon is &quot;a friend from Sag Harbor.&quot; But he adds that despite their friendship, &quot;Scanlon has no inside track. . . . I may or may not review&quot; the collection, he says.    Clients and journalists are drawn to Mr. Scanlon, in part, because of his considerable and well-displayed intellect. An interview with a reporter has barely begun before he is quoting the late Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and referring to Irish poet Seamus Heaney. An editor of Dublin's Irish Times stops in to visit, and Mr. Scanlon is soon off on another intellectual tangent, analyzing a love scene in Shakespeare's &quot;Henry V.&quot;    &quot;I'm going out to California to see the new Attenborough movie,&quot; Mr. Scanlon continues, referring to the director Richard Attenborough. &quot;I'm going to see David Puttnam (the chief executive of Columbia Pictures). I don't know him, but he's a good friend of a close friend of mine.&quot; Has the editor seen the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Fences,&quot; starring James Earl Jones? &quot;My wife was married to James for eight years,&quot; the publicist notes. &quot;She was his Desdemona in 1964. This sounds like a perfect vehicle for him.&quot; Mr. Scanlon's wife, Julienne Marie Scanlon, he explains, &quot;was a two-time Tony nominee. She was Gypsy on Broadway. I met her on a blind date after her divorce from Jimmy.&quot;    Mr. Scanlon's admirers see his swagger as a professional asset. &quot;He's got a thousand anecdotes, he's very well read, he's funny,&quot; says Mr. Auletta. &quot;One should never underestimate the importance of personality.&quot;    &quot;Historically, PR people are considered lowbrow,&quot; adds Richard Edelman, the president of Daniel J. Edelman Inc., the big public-relations firm that has owned Mr. Scanlon's business since 1984. &quot;His {Mr. Scanlon's} clients respect him as if he's an attorney.&quot; They also pay him like an attorney: Mr. Scanlon commands $250 an hour in a business where the going rate is $100.    And Mr. Scanlon's clients say he is worth it. &quot;He was a counselor in the best sense. He reminded us that we had an obligation to speak to the press, when we were pretty much in the hands of lawyers who wanted to do anything but,&quot; says Globe reporter Walter Robinson, who wrote the story over which Mr. Lakian sued for libel. The jury in that case found three paragraphs in the Globe's story to be false and published with actual malice. But jurors concluded the paragraphs weren't damaging, and thus they didn't award Mr. Lakian damages.    Unlike many people in his profession, Mr. Scanlon has never been a newspaper reporter. &quot;I'm really petrified, afraid of putting my opinions down,&quot; he says. But he found his way into PR because so many of his friends were journalists. The Bronx-born son of Irish Catholic immigrants, he was sent to a seminary at the age of 12 and spent the next decade in religious training. He emerged a Buffalo parochial-schoolteacher. He left teaching after five years, he says, because &quot;I was spending more than I was earning. I had expensive tastes.&quot;    Successively a book salesman, an editor, and a Brooklyn peace organizer, he got into public relations accidentally. In the late 1960s, he frequented the Lion's Head, a Greenwich Village tavern popular among journalists. A friend there got him a job handling press relations for New York's Mayor John Lindsay in 1968. He later was press director for Mr. Rohatyn, who at the time headed the city's Municipal Assistance Corp.    In 1975, he started his own firm, selling out to Edelman in 1984 after surviving a heart attack and triple-bypass surgery. He explains he was spending too much time managing the business and not enough time with clients. Mr. Edelman adds that Mr. Scanlon's firm was losing money.    &quot;When he first came here, we tried to manage his group like we managed everything else -- 'John, you have to give us estimated budgets a month in advance,'&quot; Mr. Edelman recalls. &quot;He said, 'I don't do this.' We acculturated. We had to, because he has talent.&quot; He adds that the business, with nine employees and nine clients, is profitable now.    When he advises his clients, Mr. Scanlon uses PR strategies that are surprisingly straightforward. Typically, he picks a theme and tries to get reporters to focus on it. He also insists that clients talk to the press.    During the CBS-Westmoreland suit, his theme was that while the network's disputed television documentary on Mr. Westmoreland and the Vietnam War did violate some customary CBS standards, the basic story was correct. The program, entitled &quot;The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception,&quot; contended that U.S. military officials gave inaccurate estimates of North Vietnamese troop strength.    Before Mr. Scanlon came aboard in 1983, &quot;we were perceived as the behemoth that had done damage to a national hero,&quot; says CBS correspondent Mike Wallace, who narrated the documentary. Soon after Mr. Scanlon joined up, Gen. Westmoreland's lawyer Mr. Burt held a press conference at a Washington hotel. Mr. Scanlon promptly took a room down the hall and set up his own press conference, letting CBS get in the last word.    &quot;The next day the New York Times ran the story under the headline 'Westmoreland, CBS Trade Charges.' Not 'Westmoreland Attacks CBS,'&quot; noted a September 1985 article in Public Relations Journal.    Ultimately, the case was settled out of court, and the trade publication declared CBS the winner of &quot;the public-relations verdict.&quot;    Mr. Scanlon is reluctant to talk about his current work with CBS and Drexel. The Drexel project is in early stages. And at CBS, he says, &quot;I haven't done anything in several weeks.&quot; He worries that he will offend the network's internal PR departments if he appears to be taking a star turn. Over and again, he stresses that he is merely acting as &quot;additional hands and new ears.&quot;    But whatever he does for these clients, his most visible PR creation will probably remain himself. It comes naturally, even when he gets away from it all and plays softball in Sag Harbor. There, says friend and admirer Mr. Zuckerman, the man who once kept quiet for an entire year &quot;has won the 'infield chatter award' two years in a row.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
