Of all the world's religions, they said, Islam is the fastestgrowing.   Writers John R. Weeks, who directs the International PopulationCenter at San Diego State University in California, and SaadGadalla, its technical director, said that about 42 babies are bornto every 1,000 people in Moslem countries each year.   That compares with fewer than 34 in other Third World countriesand only 13 in the western industrial world.   The study, ``The Demography of Islamic Nations,'' was distributedin Washington by the Population Reference Bureau, a private group.   Weeks said in a telephone interview that the Moslem growth is duefirst of all to low incomes, which he said were largely a result ofdecades of colonial rule in the Islamic world.   ``When the economic situation goes up, the fertility rate goesdown,'' he said. ``When the status of women goes up, fertility goesdown too.''   The study pointed to Islamic countries, particularly Tunisia,where both the economy and the status of women have improved inrecent years. It also noted the disadvantages of women in Moslemcountries, including the prevalence of teen-age marriages and lowlevels of education.   The authors estimated that 980 million of the world's 5.2 billionpeople are Moslems. By 2020, they estimated, Moslems will total 1.9billion people out of roughly 8.6 billion people.   Indonesia has the world's largest Moslem population, 156,136,000,the authors said. Of all Moslem nations, they said, Indonesia haslikely made the greatest headway in slowing its population growth.   ``The immediate explanation for the drop in fertility was therapid increase in contraceptive use among married couples ofreproductive age,'' the study said.   Pakistan has the second largest Moslem population, 104,243,000;followed by Bangladesh, 93,050,000, and India with 89,034,000.</TEXT></DOC>
