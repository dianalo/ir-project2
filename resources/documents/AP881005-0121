Journal on the United Nations' peacekeepingactivities:   It has been a remarkable year for peace and the United Nations.We have witnessed considerable progress in the Persian Gulf,Angola, Cambodia and elsewhere _ in large part because of U.N.efforts.   But as U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar remindsus, ``The recent achievements of the United Nations have neitherbeen sudden nor fortuitous but are the hard-won results ofpersistence and dedication over many years, epitomized by thepeacekeeping activities of the organization.''   And so it is most fitting that this year's Nobel Peace Prize hasbeen awarded to U.N. peacekeeping forces. It is, as Perez deCuellar so eloquently put it, a tribute to ``idealism, valor andsacrifice.''   Recognition is long overdue for the 500,000 troops from 58countries, including 800 killed in the line of duty, who havehelped keep peace and ease tensions in world hot spots since 1948.   For 40 years, the world has owed them a debt of gratitude.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 3   Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on trade restrictions:   The American consumer won a victory with President Reagan's vetoof a bill that would limit textile and shoe imports.   Trade restrictions hurt American consumers far more than theyhelp the protected industries because they invite retaliatorycountermeasures from other countries.   They allow uncompetitive industries to maintain a shelteredexistence and force consumers to pay more for the products theseindustries produce than if the products had to compete with othersfrom throughout the world.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 29   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on steroid use at theOlympics:   Evidence of Stanozol (the anabolic steroid detected in a urinesample submitted by Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter) costJohnson his medal and millions of dollars in endorsements. ...   Athletes, more than any other segment of our society, have beensingled out for their abuse of so-called recreational drugs.   Wall Street brokers, presidential candidates and newspapereditors do not undergo the type of scrutiny now expected ofthird-string halfbacks in the National Football League.   This treatment of athletes is unfair.   But steroids, intended to enhance performance, are a differentstory. Rather than abuse his body for a high, an athlete abuses hisbody to gain a competitive edge, compromising the sprit ofcompetition.   Ben Johnson has become an embarrassment to the nation of Canadaand an object of scorn among ``clean'' athletes. In the end,however, Johnson is a fortunate man. He was caught, and presumablywill stop this tragic drug abuse.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 30   Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune on gun control:   Sixteen-year-old Jason Ivy will stand trial for shooting hisstepsister with a .22 caliber pistol that his father kept under themattress in his bedroom.   Apparently Jason got hopped up on heavy metal music and justdecided to act out some of the fantasy that was spinning in hishead. A handgun was handy, so he used it. ...   When will we wake up and realize the horrible mistake inallowing people to keep these small, easily concealed handguns? ...   We ought to ban these small handguns and give police full searchand seizure powers to confiscate them. Seizing handguns would beinfinitely more beneficial to society than seizing marijuana plants.   Where is our leadership on this issue?</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 29   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on congressional honorariums:   The decision by two major defense contractors, McDonnell Douglasand General Dynamics, to suspend temporarily their practice ofpaying honorariums to congressmen for speeches is a welcomereaction to the current investigation of Pentagon fraud. It's notenough, however.   Paying members of Congress for speeches is at best a fraud. Acongressman shows up at a function sponsored by a militarycontractor ..., makes a brief speech, and pockets upwards of$2,000. True, the House and Senate have imposed some limits, butthat doesn't make it right.   Usually the honorariums are paid to congressmen who serve oncommittees considering legislation in which the companies ororganizations have an interest. The likelihood of a conflict ofinterest on the part of a congressman is obvious.   At first it sounds plausible to argue that the limitation makesit unlikely a congressman will be influenced. But many congressmenreceive up to $2,000 from each of several companies.   When members of Congress take money from companies that dobusiness with the government, they are at least giving theimpression that their votes are for sale. The people deserve better.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
