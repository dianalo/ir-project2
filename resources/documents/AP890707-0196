The coalescence of a dependable conservative majority led andnurtured by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was so pronouncedthat legal scholars predict it will influence the course of Americansociety for decades.   ``This is the year the Rehnquist court came of age,'' said A.E.Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor. ``We have nowseen the emergence of a bloc of justices on the court who in atleast most of the court's agenda can be predictably conservative.''   In his first full term, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy tipped thebalance of power _ leading some to compare his role to that ofArthur Goldberg on the liberal-dominated court of the 1960s.   Kennedy, the last of three high court appointments made by formerPresident Reagan, replaced Lewis F. Powell, a generally conservativejustice who most often joined the court's liberal wing on abortionand civil rights.   Powell served as a fulcrum, often the pivotal vote on the mostdivisive issues before the court. That role has been inherited byJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Reagan appointee more conservativethan Powell.   The court's conservatives also include Reagan appointee AntoninScalia and Byron R. White, who was appointed by John F. Kennedy in1962.   Most often left in dissent in the term's major cases wereliberals William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmunand John Paul Stevens.   Of 132 signed decisions, 32 were reached by 5-4 votes. Rehnquistwas in the majority in 81 percent of those; Brennan in 22 percent.The two were on opposite sides in 30 of the 32.   The court, in 5-4 votes, gave states greater power to regulateabortions, allowed capital punishment for mentally retardedmurderers and killers who committed their crimes when as young as16, and dismayed civil rights activists in a series of rulings.   The court strayed from its conservative course in severalfree-speech decisions, most notably ruling that burning the Americanflag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest.   Here are summaries of the major Supreme Court rulings of the1988-89 term:</TEXT><BYLINE>CIVIL RIGHTS</BYLINE><TEXT>   _The court made it more difficult for minorities and women toprove on-the-job bias by using statistics showing that women andminorities are under-represented in an employer's higher-paying jobs.   _The court gave white men more power to challenge as unlawful``reverse discrimination'' court-approved affirmative actionprograms helping women and minorities.   _States and state officials are not among the ``persons'' who canbe sued under a much-used 1871 law authorizing monetary damages forthose whose rights are violated.   _Local governments may not be sued under the same 1871 law whentheir employees violate someone's rights unless it can be proved theviolation was part of an official government policy.   _Another key civil rights law, enacted in 1866, cannot be used tofight on-the-job racial or sexual harassment.   _The court made it more difficult for employers to defendthemselves against bias charges by contending their adverse actionswere based on ``mixed motives'' _ some legal and some illegal.</TEXT><BYLINE>CRIMINAL LAW</BYLINE><TEXT>   _The government may seize criminal suspects' assets even if suchconfiscations leave the suspects unable to hire the lawyers of theirchoice.   _The court made it significantly easier for police to stop,question and search airline passengers suspected of drugtrafficking. The justices upheld the arrest and conviction of a manstopped because he matched the ``profile'' characteristics of a drugcourier.   _The court upheld sentencing rules that reduce the discretionindividual judges have in meting out the punishment for variousfederal crimes.   _Police may stray from the precise wording of the famous Mirandawarnings given to criminal suspects, even if the result arguablyconfuses suspects about their right to free legal help.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
