<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0221 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since May 1985, The Magnetic Measurements Engineering Group at LBL hasmeasured and sorted a total of 3834 permanent magnet blocks. These magneticblocks have been used in the construction of various successful beam-lineelements including dipoles, quadrupoles, and wigglers. We report on observedvariations in magnetic moments among blocks supplied by five manufacturers,describe the operational capabilities (accuracy, precision, and resolution)of the LBL Magnetic-moment Measurement and Sorting System (MMSS), citethe results of comparative calibrations by permanent-magnet manufacturersand other National Laboratories, and suggest criteria for automatingthe MMSS for measuring the large number of permanent-magnet blocks requiredfor the insertion devices for the projected LBL 1-2 GeV Synchrotron RadiationSource. 14 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
