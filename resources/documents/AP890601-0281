Nectarines are a unique fruit that originally grew wild inAsia. The California supply is appearing at produce counters nowand will peak in late June through August.   The lovely red blush on nectarine skins is related to variety,not ripeness. The fruit is picked mature but firm for packing andshipping. When you get nectarines home, place them in a looselyclosed paper bag for several days to complete ripening. Don'trefrigerate _ this interrupts the ripening process. Even ripenectarines are most flavorful at room temperature. One pound (3medium nectarines) makes about 2 cups sliced.
