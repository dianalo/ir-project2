There is a ``serious-minded, success-oriented approach to thealternatives,'' Adm. Ronald J. Hays said.   Hays said in an interview Monday that he has been surprised atthe intensity of issues being debated in the review of the 1947Military Bases Agreement under which the United States maintainsfacilities at Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smallerinstallations in the Philippines. The agreement expires inSeptember 1991.   ``However, I'm still optimistic about reaching an agreement. Theeconomic security and political implications associated with ourdeparture would be astronomical,'' Hays said.   He declined to identify nations which might host U.S. militarybases.   ``The problem is that the nations who are forthcoming to us on aprivate basis and who will readily concede that indeed bases atClark and Subic are important are unwilling for a variety ofreasons to go public and to take an official public position ofsupport for the United States,'' said Hays.   The admiral said it would cost $10 billion or more to duplicatethe facilities in the Philippines. However, he said that less thanhalf that amount might be available to prepare alternate bases,which would mean a reduced U.S. presence in the region.</TEXT></DOC>
