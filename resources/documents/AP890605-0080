Joseph Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica,withheld from investigators early in 1987 details of hisinvolvement with Oliver North's secret Contra resupply network,according to prosecutors.   The three-page bill of particulars filed by the office ofindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh is the most detailed summary todate of allegedly misleading statements made by Fernandez.   He faces a trial July 24 on charges of obstructing inquiriesinto the Iran-Contra affair and making false statements. The 19instances of allegedly misleading statements form the basis of thegovernment's two obstruction charges.   Fernandez told congressional investigators in 1987 under a grantof immunity from prosecution that he had been involved from theinception in the planning of a secret airstrip in Costa Rica. Healso detailed extensive dealings with the Contras and a number ofcontacts with North.   Several months earlier, Fernandez told the CIA's office ofinspector general that he merely monitored the development of theairstrip, according to the bill of particulars.   Fernandez told the Tower Commission in January 1987 he had onlyoccasional conversations with North before September 1986,according to the document.   It was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,and a copy was made available Monday by the independent counsel'soffice in Washington.   Fernandez also told the Tower Commission that he had nevercommunicated with Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to runarms to the Contras.   In his subsequent testimony to Congress in a deposition,Fernandez said he had met with Secord in Washington and discussedthe secret Costa Rican airstrip. The airstrip was to be used tohelp resupply the Contras battling the leftist government ofNicaragua.   Fernandez also said in January 1987 that he hadn't had anycontact with Felix Rodriguez since 1971. He later told Congressthat he spoke with Rodriguez by phone during the period of thesecret Contra resupply operation.   North brought Rodriguez into the resupply operation in September1985.   Rodriguez is a long-time acquaintance of Donald Gregg, who wasGeorge Bush's national security adviser when he was vice president.Bush has nominated Gregg to be U.S. ambassador to South Korea, butthe nomination is mired in the Senate over questions about Gregg'srole in the Iran-Contra affair.</TEXT></DOC>
