Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said his proposal would allow theRepublican administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress tobridge serious differences on defense spending policy and ``build astrategic consensus.''   ``We can expect only a flat defense budget and the strategicprogram of the Reagan administration simply won't fit. Something hasto be done and confrontation isn't likely to accomplish it,'' Aspinsaid in a speech to the National Press Club.   He said approximately $31 billion a year should be made availablefor all strategic weapons, with none of it earmarked for anyspecific weapon.   Under the 10-year plan, money would be pooled for the StrategicDefense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars; the B-52, B-1B andB-2 stealth bombers; and the Trident, MX and Midgetman missiles.   The annual budget for the pool would remain constant at about the$31 billion level _ the total budget for the strategic programs in1989 _ with adjustments for inflation, Aspin said.   He said spending for weapons systems usually begins slowly,increases midway through production and tails off at the end. Theprogram would permit tradeoffs in which more money could be spent ona weapons system in the middle of production, Aspin said.   ``The question is no longer merely either-or. It is also sooneror later,'' he said.   The program would force Congress and the new administration underPresident-elect Bush to decide what specific weapon systems shouldbe purchased and deployed and which should be delayed, the committeechairman suggested.   ``This great pot of strategic programs and funding I'm proposingwould also expand enormously the range of alternatives at thedisposal of policymakers,'' Aspin said. ``Right now, these issuesare arbitrarily straight-jacketed.''   For example, Aspin and other Democrats in Congress have favoredthe truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman missile while the Reaganadministration has proposed scrapping the weapon.   Aspin said his plan would let research and development fundingfor the Midgetman begin in fiscal 1990 with possible depoloyment in1995.   To compensate for moving forward on the Midgetman, Aspinsuggested slowing down stealth bomber purchases for two years andlimiting spending on Star Wars to its current annual level of $4billion through 1996.   ``Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans, White House andCongress, to put all the weapon systems into the pot, take a long,10-year view, work the trade-offs and build a strategic consensus,''Aspin said.</TEXT></DOC>
