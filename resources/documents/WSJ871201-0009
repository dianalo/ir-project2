In an hour-long interview with NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw, his first with a U.S. television network, Mr. Gorbachev appeared eager for next week's summit meeting with President Reagan, and he sought to convey the impression that the Soviet Union poses no threat to the U.S. or any other nation.    &quot;We cannot, however strong we might be, we cannot dictate our values or impose our way of life upon others, impose upon others our choice,&quot; he said. The interview was conducted in Moscow last week and broadcast last night.    Mr. Gorbachev, who sat across a table from Mr. Brokaw, smiled and talked animatedly during the interview. No interpreters were in sight. NBC deleted the translations of Mr. Brokaw's questions into Russian, and it broadcast English translations of the Soviet leader's answers over his voice.    Mr. Gorbachev is coming to Washington to sign a treaty under which the U.S. and the Soviets will eliminate their intermediate- and short-range nuclear missiles. But the summit is likely to be dominated by as yet unresolved arms-control issues, including possible cuts in longer-range, or &quot;strategic,&quot; weapons and possible restrictions on development of space-based missile defenses.    Soviet officials in the past have suggested they might agree to a 50% cut in nuclear arsenals if the U.S. promises to adhere to an interpretation of the ABM treaty that would limit testing of anti-missile defense systems. Mr. Gorbachev's comments on that issue underscored the Soviet leader's desire to win limits on the U.S. Star Wars program.    But in his interview on U.S. television, Mr. Gorbachev seemed to take a somewhat more relaxed view of Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars, than he did during the two leaders' last meeting 13 months ago in Iceland. At that time, Mr. Gorbachev sought to confine missile-defense research to laboratories, but in his NBC interview he demanded only that SDI research be conducted within the limits of the so-called narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty.    The narrow view of the treaty still would allow some limited testing outside of laboratories. The administration has promulgated a more liberal interpretation of the treaty, but it has been challenged by congressional leaders.    Some SDI researchers insist that accepting the narrow interpretation of the treaty could slow Star Wars research, and Mr. Reagan himself has insisted he won't accept any limitations on the development of missile defenses. In a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation yesterday, Mr. Reagan warned that the Soviets may be developing defenses that are banned by the ABM Treaty, and he argued that his Star Wars program is the U.S.'s only defense against such a development.    Soviet officials recently have been hinting that Moscow is prepared to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, perhaps in six months or less, but Mr. Gorbachev offered Mr. Brokaw little beyond a vague assurance that he's looking for ways to solve the problem quickly. Though other Soviet officials have done so in the past, he didn't call the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan a mistake, instead insisting that the Soviets sent troops at the request of the Afghan government.    At the same time, he dismissed U.S. fears that the Marxist government of Nicaragua poses a threat to U.S. security. &quot;That's not serious,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said.    By politely challenging Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions, something other interviewers have been reluctant to do, Mr. Brokaw managed to extract several revealing glimpses of the leader whom Soviet President Andrei Gromyko once described as having &quot;a nice smile but iron teeth.&quot;    For example, when Mr. Brokaw asked Mr. Gorbachev if he was willing to permit free emigration from the Soviet Union, the Soviet leader first filibustered, then accused unnamed outsiders of trying to organize a brain drain. The Soviet leader called the abrupt, public dismissal of one of his closest allies, former Moscow party chief Boris Yeltsin, &quot;no mistake&quot; and added pointedly: &quot;We will not allow any adventurism.&quot;    When Mr. Brokaw explored the limits of perestroika, Mr. Gorbachev's ambitious program for restructuring the Soviet economy, the Soviet leader made it clear he has no intention of permitting unemployment or allowing individual enterprises to set prices. &quot;We will resolve this in the framework of socialism and through our own methods,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said.    When Mr. Brokaw asked whether an alternative to the Communist Party might be permitted in the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev replied, &quot;I see no need for any other party, and I think that is the view of our society.&quot;    The Soviet leader also demonstrated a mastery of facts and a healthy ego. At one point, he cited a 1944 proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt for a Bill of Social and Economic Rights, and on another he noted that Soviet citizens consume an average of 3,300 calories per day.    When Mr. Brokaw inquired how he would like to be remembered by Americans 10 years from now, Mr. Gorbachev made it clear that he intends to be more than a memory 10 years hence. &quot;Well, I don't think in 10 years' time everything should belong only to the memory,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
