Robert DiGennaro, 40, who resigned as chairman of the SuffieldSavings Bank last July, faces one count of obstruction of justice,two counts of perjury and one count of encouraging perjury, saidAssistant U.S. Attorney Gary C. Crossen.   He also was charged with one count each of insider trading, wirefraud and mail fraud in a federal indictment today in New Haven,Conn.   Arthur Silverman, 62, a West Hartford, Conn., stockbroker, wascharged with one count of perjury in the Boston indictment and thesame three counts as DiGennaro today in New Haven. Silverman wasnot in court in Boston to enter a plea.   DiGennaro, who was arraigned in Boston before U.S. MagistrateJoyce London Alexander, pleaded innocent on all four charges andwas released on his own recognizance. His travel was restricted towithin New England and he was ordered not to try to obtain apassport, Crossen said.   It was not immediately clear if Silverman and DiGennaro hadentered pleas to the charges in New Haven.   The charges are came out of a federal Securities and ExchangeCommission investigation into the merger between Suffield Savingsand Coastal Bank of Portland, Maine.   The Boston charges were based on allegedly perjured testimony bythe two men before SEC officials in Boston in 1987.   U.S. Attorney Frank McNamara said his office is conducting acomprehensive investigation into insider trading across New England.   McNamara said no one involved in the case made more than $50,000and that the total amount of profit was in the ``mid-six figures.''   ``You don't have to be an Ivan Boesky to be concerned about theproblem of insider trading,'' McNamara said. ``Insider trading andperjury in the white-collar world of the kind we deal with is aproblem federal authorities in New England are going to ferretout.''   Crossen said a federal investigation of DiGennaro on insidertrading charges is pending in the U.S. attorney's New Haven, Conn.,office.   According to the indictments, DiGennaro was not personallyinvolved in insider trading but did profit from the alleged deals.It said Silverman purchased more than 2,000 shares of Coastal stockfor clients and family members in the days leading up to the merger.   The indictments charge DiGennaro with providing a number ofpeople with secret information about the merger while he wasdiscussing the possibility of a merger with Coastal betweenFebruary 1986 and July 1986, when the sale became public.   Based on information they got from DiGennaro, a number of peoplepurchased stock in Coastal before the announcement of the merger,the indictments say. The indictments said Silverman learned aboutthe secret merger discussions from a man who said he got hisinformation from DiGennaro.   Each count carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a$250,000 fine.   Suffield Savings was purchased by Coastal on July 9, 1986, for$5.2 million, or $40 a share. Authorities began investigating thecase because the day before the merger, Coastal stock rose $2 ashare on heavy trading to close at $31.25. The stock rose another$3 a share the day the merger was announced.</TEXT></DOC>
