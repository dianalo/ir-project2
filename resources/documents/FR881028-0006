Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act, and rules issued thereunder, areunique in that they are brought about through group action of essentiallysmall entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have smallentity orientation and compatibility.This regulation is issued under Marketing Order No. 910, as amended [7CFR Part 910] regulating the handling of lemons grown in California andArizona. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing AgreementAct (the ``Act,'' 7 U.S.C. 601-674), as amended. This action is based uponthe recommendation and information submitted by the Lemon AdministrativeCommittee (Committee) and upon other available information. It is foundthat this action will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.This regulation is consistent with the marketing policy for 1988-89. TheCommittee met publicly on October 25, 1988, in Redlands, California, toconsider the current and prospective conditions of supply and demand andrecommended, by a 12-1 vote, a quantity of lemons deemed advisable to behandled during the specified week. The Committee reports that the demandfor lemons is strong.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is further found that it is impracticable,unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary noticeand engage in further public procedure with respect to this action andthat good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this actionuntil 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> because of insufficient time between the datewhen information became available upon which this regulation is based andthe effective date necessary to effectuate the declared purposes of theAct. Interested persons were given an opportunity to submit informationand views on the regulation at an open meeting. It is necessary, in orderto effectuate the declared purposes of the Act, to make these regulatoryprovisions effective as specified, and handlers have been apprised of suchprovisions and the effective time.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 910</ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, California, Arizona, Lemons.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 910 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 910_LEMONS GROWN IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA</ITAG>1.
