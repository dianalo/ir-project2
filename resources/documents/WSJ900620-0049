In a draft of administrative charges that are the basisfor actions being taken against Neil Bush, thrift regulatorssaid Mr. Bush, a former director of Silverado Banking,Savings andamp; Loan Association, never told the board of a $3million loan he received from Denver developer Kenneth Good.At the same time, Silverado's board was considering releasingMr. Good from having to repay $8.5 million of borrowingsbecause of his financial difficulties. Mr. Bush abstainedfrom voting on that matter.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Bush willfully breached his fiduciary duty to SilveradoBanking by failing to disclose&quot; that information, said thedraft, which was released by the House Banking Committee. Mr.Bush, an outside director, was never an operating officer ofSilverado. The charge is the most severe of three outlined inthe draft enforcement resolution.   Mr. Good eventually defaulted on $31 million in Silveradoloans. The Office of Thrift Supervision declined to commenton the draft, except to say thrift regulators lack sufficientevidence to seek an order barring Mr. Bush from the thrift orbanking industries. Five former Silverado directors andofficers have consented to be barred from the industry.   Instead, thrift regulators have Mr. Bush's case before anadministrative law judge, seeking a cease-and-desist orderthat would prohibit Mr. Bush from engaging in unsafe bankingor thrift activities. The administrative law judge willrecommend any action to be taken against Mr. Bush to TimothyRyan, who is director of the thrift office and was specialcounsel to President Bush's 1988 campaign.   The enforcement resolution also contended that Neil Bushshould have abstained in votes approving loans to anotherbusiness associate, Bill Walters. Mr. Bush also failed todisclose his business relationship with Mr. Good whenSilverado approved a $900,000 line of credit for thedeveloper, the resolution said. Mr. Bush couldn't be reachedfor comment.   In an appearance last month before the Banking Committee,Mr. Bush said his links to borrowers who defaulted on loansposed no conflict of interest. He said that while hisbusiness partners invested in his oil and gas operations, hedidn't invest in their businesses and thus wouldn't benefitby helping them obtain loans.   At a 9 1/2-hour hearing yesterday, members criticizedregulators for failing to rein in Silverado sooner andquestioned a series of complex deals between Silveradoofficers.   One window into the attitude of Silverado's operatingofficers toward its directors was a 1986 memo to Mike Wise,former Silverado chairman, from the chief operating officer,Richard Vandapool.   &quot;In 1986, you should reduce the number of directors to abare regulatory minimum, reduce the number of directormeetings to four each year and then let the executivecommittee deal with monthly issues and requirements,&quot; itsaid, referring to the board positions, including Mr. Bush's,as &quot;rubber-stamp directorships.&quot;   At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Vandapool called the memo&quot;tongue in cheek&quot; and said the board was actually expandedlater.   Silverado, whose losses totaled roughly $1 billion, wassold with another thrift to First Nationwide, the thriftsubsidiary of Ford Motor Co.   Meanwhile, the White House pointedly tried to defendPresident Bush from attempts to blame him or otherRepublicans for the prolonged Sandamp;L debacle. White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater launched the effort by urgingreporters to examine the roles of various Democrats.   &quot;I'm saying the Democrats have a big role in it. . . .Take a look at {former House Speaker} Jim Wright and {formerRep.} Tony Coelho and Mr. {Sen. Bob} Kerrey and some of hisNebraska accounts and {Michigan Sen.} Don Riegle and {ArizonaSen. Dennis} DeConcini -- take a look at all of them,&quot; Mr.Fitzwater said. &quot;If they want to make this a political issue,we'll be glad to do it.&quot;   Mr. Fitzwater also singled out former House BankingCommittee Chairman Fernand St Germain, saying, &quot;I don't thinkyou hear any serious analysis of this problem that doesn'tpoint to Freddy St Germain and the changes that were made inthe banking laws back at that point.&quot; Former Rhode IslandRep. St Germain was instrumental in the adoption of lawsderegulating the thrift industry but was defeated in the 1988election after close ties to thrift lobbyists and otherquestionable practices were exposed.   Mr. Fitzwater said the White House's pique was stirred byspeeches by Sen. Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who hasquestioned the administration's estimates of the cost of thethrift bailout and has referred to Mr. Bush as &quot;the Sandamp;Lpresident.&quot; Each of the other lawmakers Mr. Fitzwatermentioned has been tied to thrift executives in incidentsthat have caused them political damage. But Mr. Kerrey hasn'tbeen accused of any improper action involving thrifts, andMr. Fitzwater didn't provide any examples, saying only thatreporters should look into it.   Democrats reacted with outrage to Mr. Fitzwater'ssuggestion that they are unfairly politicizing the thriftissue, and they vowed to continue speaking out. Mr. Kerreysaid on the Senate floor that Democrats ought to become moreoutspoken and not be &quot;threatened by petulant statements by apress secretary.&quot;   ---   Michel McQueen contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
