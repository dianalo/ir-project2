But, he explains, &quot;my mother, who is a woman of respectable age, wouldn't have understood if I allowed myself to be bought at such a price.&quot; Mrs. Drucker needn't worry about her son's ending up in the poorhouse, though. To keep him, Antenne 2 reportedly nearly doubled his monthly salary to the current equivalent of $25,000 and boosted his show's budget.    Like Mr. Drucker's mother, much of France is upset that &quot;the indecent law of cash,&quot; as one news magazine puts it, has taken hold of its television. &quot;Is it wise in a country where the average person earns about 8,000 francs ($1,340) a month that some entertainer can earn in a few hours 30 times more money than a factory worker earns in 25 days?&quot; asks the weekly L'Evenement du Jeudi.    Indeed, the recent sale to private shareholders of TF1 and the Conservative government's decision to re-award ownership of La 5 and of M6 (previously known as TV6) have led in recent weeks to a no-holds-barred scrap over stars and the rights to popular programs. French television, a government monopoly until just two years ago, is suddenly a battlefield.    &quot;It's a fight to death, a real murder affair between private channels that are trying to kill each other,&quot; says Pierre Desgraupes, former chairman of Antenne 2.    In the U.S., such rivalry is standard fare for commercial television. But in France, which has long considered television a public service and a cultural force, discovering that it's also a business has come as a jolt. And although many business executives laud the recent rehabilitation of free enterprise and profit, many Frenchmen clearly draw the line at television. The new television scene &quot;reeks of money,&quot; says Mr. Desgraupes, echoing a widely held feeling in France.    Magazines are full of letters from readers outraged at the huge salaries being paid to what they say are TV stars of dubious cultural merit. Intellectuals worry that the mass-market nature of commercial TV will debase cultural standards.    Some commentators hurl the supreme insult: French television is becoming Americanized. &quot;We're getting the worst of America,&quot; says Marc Michaux, a young French advertising executive. &quot;Under the guise of making France a modern country, they're giving us mediocre television, an opium-of-the-people style TV.&quot; Adds an editorial in the right-wing daily Le Quotidien de Paris, the TV war reflects the &quot;accelerated transformation of our behavior on the Yankee model, for better or for worse.&quot;    Indeed, capitalism has come to French television with a vengeance. Unlike the state-run stations Antenne 2 and FR3, the newly established private stations receive no public subsidies, and so have launched a free-for-all bidding contest to attract popular TV figures who can bring in more advertising revenue.    It all began with what the French have dubbed Star Wars, where the weapons are checkbooks rather than space guns. The war was started by Robert Hersant and Silvio Berlusconi, the owners of La 5, who raided TF1 last month and signed up its leading stars for salaries unheard of in France. Patrick Sabatier, a blow-dried, gleaming-toothed emcee, reportedly signed a contract with La 5 worth $1.67 million a year. Stephane Collaro, whose show, &quot;Cocoricocoboy,&quot; features topless women and political spoofs, also went to La 5 from TF1 for a salary thought to be of a similar magnitude, plus about 2% of La 5's shares.    Then the war shifted to programs. La 5 outbid TF1 for the right to show the episodes of the popular American soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; next fall. But TF1 didn't completely lose out: It won the rights to &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; a &quot;Dallas&quot; spinoff that hasn't been shown here before.    And in the latest episode, France-Soir, a newspaper belonging to Mr. Hersant, the La 5 co-owner, ran a page-one story questioning if TF1 shares could be sold to the public after all this. (The state has sold 50% of TF1 to a consortium led by the construction magnate Francis Bouygues, but the remaining 50% is to be sold in a public offering. The government is eager to complete the denationalization next month, but TF1 officials and many outside analysts believe it should wait until the fall because of an uncertain profit outlook.)    The France-Soir story prompted threats of reprisals from Mr. Bouygues. &quot;Between us and the group belonging to Robert Hersant, it's total war,&quot; he says.    To some, all of this is salutary, if temporarily unsettling. &quot;We are going through a great period of modernization,&quot; says Jean-Marie Cavada, the managing director of Antenne 2. Adds Gerard Le Febvre, a top executive of the media group Information andamp; Publicite, &quot;We're very spoiled. The French have more choice now. We have three commercial TV stations, plus two public service channels that will bring different programs.&quot;    But many disagree. &quot;This destroys the idea the French had of television,&quot; says Mr. Desgraupes, the former Antenne 2 chairman.    Others fret that the quality of French television will suffer, too. They fear that to rival La 5, other channels will offer similar programs, leading to what Jean Pierrard, a French journalist, says will be &quot;stupider and stupider television&quot; with no room for culture.    The fuss over the advent of commercial television underscores how deep a change is taking place. &quot;We were 25 years late and we're brutally catching up,&quot; says Mr. Le Febvre of Information andamp; Publicite, who recently wrote a book on television. &quot;It's a complete destabilization.&quot;    For a long time, the French state kept a tight grip on the airwaves and imposed strict rules forbidding the interruption of programs with ads. The former Socialist government loosened that grip, first by creating the pay-TV channel, Canal Plus, alongside the then three state-owned channels, and last year by setting up La 5 and TV6, two private channels. But under the Socialists, La 5 didn't offer much competition to the state-run general-interest channels, and TV6 was a musical channel modeled on MTV in the U.S.    Now, however, La 5 has launched an offensive to replace TF1 as France's most popular channel, and TV6 -- renamed M6 -- has been turned into another general-interest channel by its new owners, Cie. Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and the water distributor Lyonnaise des Eaux.    Many in the TV industry think the French advertising market isn't big enough to support that many channels. &quot;Five general-interest channels are probably two too many,&quot; says Philippe Ramond, the director of La 5. &quot;One, for sure, will die. The second will live very badly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
