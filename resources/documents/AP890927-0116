(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush headed for a two-dayeducation summit with the nation's governors today predicting a``strong consensus'' for overhauling public schools and improvingclassroom performance, but he rejected any major new federalspending.   Meeting with reporters before leaving the White House, thepresident said he was looking forward to ``a candid and veryfree-flowing discussion'' with the governors and anticipated ``muchagreement ... for greater flexibility in the use of federal funds''for the schools.   ``I'm hopeful we're going to come out of the summit with acommitment to restructure and to make those fundamental changesthat are needed if we are going to improve educationalperformance,'' Bush said.   But the president balked at suggestions by several governors forexpansion of the Head Start program for needy preschool childrenand other federal school programs. Bush said ``we're not going toquintuple spending'' while struggling to reduce the budget deficit.   ``Our problem is not money, our problem is using the money thatis there effectively,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu saidon NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.   After a helicopter flight from Washington, Bush planned to jointhe governors in a series of closed-door discussions onrevitalizing the teaching profession, improving the learningenvironment _ including keeping drugs out of schools _ and decidingwho's in charge of the schools.   Even as the governors gathered on the University of Virginiacampus under clear, sunny skies, there was grumbling about WhiteHouse limitations on the role _ and visibility _ of the governorsat the summit.   With more than 900 reporters covering the talks, ``the only surething is that this is a big media event,'' said Keith Geiger,president of the National Education Association. And according toat least one governor, that's the way the White House wanted it.   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas told his fellowgovernors in a memorandum Monday that White House officials werekeeping them on a short leash at the summit.   He complained that the White House refused to make any of theworking sessions public, barred staff members from meetings betweengovernors and Cabinet members and allow only administrationofficials to prepare a summary of the discussions.   Roger Porter, a domestic policy aide to Bush and the chiefsummit planner, was reported to have replied that the governors hadapproved of the original summit scenario. But Clinton presssecretary Mike Gauldin said Porter agreed to Clinton's request forthe governors to bring note-taking aides to the meetings.   Geiger said Govs. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico and BoothGardner of Washington told him they were optimistic that the summitcould produce some general goals, but questioned whether a plancould be developed for meeting those goals. ``That's not going tohappen in two days,'' Geiger said.   The president was expected to resist any demands for heftyincreases in federal spending on education, which currentlyaccounts for $46.7 billion of the $353 billion spent at thefederal, state and local levels.   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, a former college president,led Bush's entire Cabinet with the exception of Secretary of StateJames Baker III to the summit. Most of the governors were bringingalong their top school superintendents or education advisers.   Bush said Tuesday in Washington that he wanted to ``listen andwork with the governors, not try to impose an agenda from here.''His aim, he said, was ``to see us come up with some suggestionsthat will dramatically change things.''   Not since 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt called together thegovernors in the midst of the Great Depression, have the states'chief executives and the president joined forces to examine onepressing issue.   By merely inviting the governors to the summit, Bush has drawnunprecedented attention to the failings of the nation's schools anddismal academic achievements of students.   ``I think we will establish the fact that we need measurablenational goals,'' Bush said today. ``And this, I am told, most ofthe governors agree on.''   The governors headed for the summit with plenty of their ownideas.   Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana said he wants nationalgoals to boost pupil achievement scores, reduce teen-agepregnancies and lower the school dropout rate, and assurances thateach state will have flexibility to meet its school needs free offederal intervention.   Although some governors insisted that more federal money isessential, Bayh asserted that ``just throwing money at the problemis not all there is to something as complex as education.''   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a Democrat, said, ``What isneeded most critically from the president and the federalgovernment in the area of education is leadership.''   After a state dinner tonight in a tent outside Monticello,Jefferson's home near the university, Bush and the governors are toreassemble Thursday morning for more working sessions, a luncheonconvocation and a finale at which Republican and Democraticgovernors will join Bush in delivering closing statements.</TEXT></DOC>
