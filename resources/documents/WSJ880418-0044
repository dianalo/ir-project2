Los Angeles-based De Laurentiis didn't break out fourth-quarter results. For the first nine months of 1987, the partnership had a net loss of $8.6 million on revenue of $2.8 million.    The loss for the year resulted from write-downs for released and unrealeased films and normal amortization of film costs totaling $21.8 million. Film revenue was $3.8 million. Year-earlier results weren't available because the partnership went public in March 1987. De Laurentiis Film was formed to acquire and produce motion pictures in conjunction with De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc.    De Laurentiis Film said the auditor based its opinion on De Laurentiis Entertainment's current financial condition and &quot;the resulting uncertainty in the recoverability of the partnership's film costs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
