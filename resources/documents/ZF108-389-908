(EASI) is readying an application that mergesthe power of a low-end relational database with drawing tools and a reportgenerator to give users a powerful forms package that runs on a network.andM;Called FormType, the program lets users generate custom forms, fill inexisting preprinted forms and develop custom applications that automateoffice tasks, said Greg Adams, president of the Norcross, Ga., company.andM;FormType is one of the many programs vying for a piece of the emerging formsmarketplace that will reach $29.7 million by the end of this year, accordingto Dataquest Inc., a market-research company in San Jose, Calif.andM;While FormType can read information directly from dBASE files, it goes beyondother PC-based forms packages by providing users with rudimentaryrelational-database capabilities, said Adams.andP;  This enables users toestablish links between databases, thus providing a number of ways of viewinginformation.andM;Currently, only Xerox Corp.'s FormBase provides this functionality; otherforms packages only act as front ends to existing databases or includeflat-file database functionality.andM;FormType can also be used to develop applications that automate office tasks.andO;For example, DataWay West, a consulting firm in Charlo, Mont., that betatested FormType, used the package to develop an application that automatesthe billing process for a medical institution.andP;  Based on a standard medicalform, this application allows the institution to link data together in avariety of ways -- for example, by a patient's medical history, diagnosis andinsurance information, said Chris Chavass, DataWay's president.andM;The $149.95 FormType is slated for a Comdex/Spring release.andM;A FormType LAN pack will be released at the same time and will cost $695 perserver.andP;  An OS/2 version is expected later this year.andP;  EASI can be reached at(404) 840-0474.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
