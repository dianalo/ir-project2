Leon H. Sullivan yesterday called for a mass corporate exodus and broad economic sanctions against the country.    Following through on a threat he made two years ago, Mr. Sullivan called for all U.S. companies to leave within nine months. He also urged trade sanctions against the country, the end of all South African imports by the U.S. including gold and diamonds, and the cutoff of all diplomatic relations until apartheid is abolished.    Mr. Sullivan, a member of a Reagan administration advisory committee on South Africa, also blistered the president with criticism for his alleged inattention and inactivity on the issue, and urged sanctions against U.S. trading partners, such as Japan, that move to take over the business left behind by U.S. companies. &quot;If the president had taken the same interest in black South Africans as he does in Contras, we wouldn't have the problems we have in South Africa,&quot; he said, vowing to make South Africa a key issue in the presidential campaign.    The White House declined comment on Mr. Sullivan's remarks.    Mr. Sullivan's announcement amounts to a concession that his 10-year campaign to use his so-called Sullivan Principles as a weapon to end apartheid has failed to attain that lofty goal.    A business group known as the U.S. Corporate Council, whose members met privately with Mr. Sullivan before his news conference, quickly issued a statement expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; at his decision. The group also pledged to step up efforts to apply his principles as long as they remain in South Africa.    Meanwhile, a number of companies said they intend to continue their operations in South Africa for now, including American Cyanamid Corp., Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., Union Carbide Corp., Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co., Johnson andamp; Johnson and Unisys Corp.    RJR Nabisco Inc., a major employer in South Africa, also said it wouldn't leave, adding that it will seek to help establish a new independent review process to rate corporations' performance on the principles now that Mr. Sullivan has stepped aside.    Since 1977, U.S. companies have used adherence to the Sullivan Principles as a justification for continuing to operate in South Africa despite pressure from anti-apartheid groups and shareholders. The principles -- followed by 110 of the 199 U.S. companies still doing business there -- call for desegregated workplaces, equal employment practices, equal pay, training for non-whites, aggressive promotions of blacks, and spending on housing, education and other social services.    Mr. Sullivan's sharp reversal could deal a blow to companies already under fierce political pressure. It may spark a new round of corporate departures, even as companies scramble for new approaches and pledge to continue following the principles whose founder has left them behind.    &quot;Some companies will head for the hills. Others will dig in their heels,&quot; said Marcy M. Murninghan of Mitchell Investment Management Co., which advises U.S. companies on South Africa. Now that Mr. Sullivan has turned away from his own principles -- which were increasingly being criticized as ineffective by other anti-apartheid activists -- Ms. Murninghan predicts the debate will focus on how companies can withdraw while giving black South Africans an economic stake.    Mr. Sullivan, a longtime civil-rights activist and a black Baptist minister who used his seat on the General Motors Corp. board as a corporate pulpit, had warned two years ago that he would sound the call for a corporate exodus if apartheid didn't end by May 1987.    Mr. Sullivan has been under pressure recently from companies urging him to back off from that threat. He indicated that he made the decision despite agonizing over a decade of lost effort, and concern over the impact his action will have on black South Africans.    Mr. Sullivan made his announcement in subdued, saddened tones in a private meeting with company executives here, who gave him a standing ovation even though many have resisted and resented his proddings. He followed that with an intense, sermon-like announcement in a crowded news conference, likening the South African government to Hitler and warning of an apocalyptic racial war if it continues refusing to change.    &quot;In spite of our efforts, the main pillars of apartheid remain and blacks are still denied basic civil rights. Repression against blacks grows. People are brutalized. The government's intransigence to fundamental change continues,&quot; Mr. Sullivan said. &quot;The time has come for American corporations and the U.S. to take a definitive stand against the evils of apartheid.&quot;    Mr. Sullivan's pronouncement was harsher than some executives expected. Some had hoped he would withdraw from the scene but continue advocating his tenets. But activists say Mr. Sullivan's new stance is likely to damage the code's effectiveness. Asked about companies' efforts to follow &quot;Sullivan without Sullivan,&quot; he said yesterday, &quot;As far as I'm concerned, I won't be supporting the principles for U.S. companies that stay.&quot;    Fifty U.S. companies pulled out of South Africa last year, and 33 have completed or announced pullout plans so far this year, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center. For example, Emhart Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. announced plans earlier this year to sell their remaining South African operations.    Companies planning to stay had mixed responses to Mr. Sullivan's announcement. A Goodyear spokesman said, &quot;We don't believe this would be in the best interests of blacks, and our employees have asked us not to leave.&quot;    A spokesman for USG Corp. said, &quot;We don't see how anyone in South Africa, particularly employees of our subsidiary, would benefit by our divesting the operation.&quot; The USG spokesman added that a divestiture proposal was defeated at last month's annual meeting and, &quot;based on that vote, we have no reason to believe our stockholders feel any differently.&quot;    A spokesman for Minnesota Mining said Mr. Sullivan's latest statement &quot;will be a factor in our continuing review of our South African operation.&quot; He added, &quot;For now, we continue to look forward to peaceful changes in South Africa and our operations continue to be guided by the original Sullivan principles.&quot;    Wilfred Koplowitz, director of international relations at Citibank, a constant target of student protests as the only U.S. bank that hasn't adopted tougher loan restrictions in South Africa, said yesterday each company will decide its own course and that he doesn't see immediate reason to leave.    &quot;A circle of hard-core companies will always remain,&quot; said Sal G. Marzullo, a Mobil Corp. executive who heads the Industry Support Unit, a group of companies that follow the Sullivan Principles. That circle seems likely to include Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell South Africa unit, and other big mining and energy-related concerns attracted to the country's rich deposits and extensive energy needs.    Mr. Sullivan said he has pledges from pension funds to increase pressure on companies and sell off $80 billion in equities of U.S. firms if they don't leave. But any such sales may be spread over time, and some big investors oppose the idea. New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan won't sell stocks because he estimates it would cost his state retirement fund $300 million to $600 million in extra fees and commissions, not to mention losing out on rising values of shares. &quot;We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars in cost, to achieve nothing -- a press release,&quot; he said.    Mr. Sullivan's announcement may affect shareholder resolutions and investment policies now pegged to the Sullivan code. Some 127 shareholder resolutions were filed by anti-apartheid groups in the current annual meeting season, compared with 78 the previous year. And 80 of them urged outright withdrawal instead of merely asking companies to follow the Sullivan code, according to the Council on Economic Priorities, a research group. The resolutions typically are defeated, but they have gained some support; proposals received only an 8% positive vote a year ago but now average 13% and in cases such as Dresser Industries Inc. topped 20%, according to Mitchell Investment.    Mr. Sullivan yesterday urged companies that withdraw from South Africa to sell their local unit to companies that promise to continue fair-employment practices, bring blacks into management and give blacks an ownership stake where possible. Companies such as GM and International Business Machines Corp. have been criticized for allowing their products to be sold after their departure by their former units in South Africa; Mr. Sullivan said such licensing agreements are acceptable if they are granted to black businessmen.    In his private meeting with executives before his news briefing, Mr. Sullivan thanked companies for past support, but said, &quot;From today on, I know we won't be working together for the struggle against apartheid. Rather, for many of you we will be perhaps divided in this endeavor. But I have done the best I could,&quot; he told them. &quot;Goodbye to you. Good luck.&quot;    (Revised WSJ June 8, 1987)   ---        Top 20 U.S. Companies in South Africa                  (As of May 1987) Company                      Number of Employees Mobil Corp. .....................  3,013 RJR Nabisco Inc. ................. 2,479 Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. ....... 2,471 USG Corp.
