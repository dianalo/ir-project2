Prosecutors also said others may have been involved in theembezzling scheme apparently led by Werner Nachmann, who headed theCentral Jewish Council for 23 years until his death in January.   Jewish leaders said they would launch their own inquiry.   ``We need a wide-ranging explanation, we must get to the bottomof this,'' a Jewish leader in Frankfurt, Ignatz Bubis, told HesseState radio.   ``We will use all legal means at our disposal to take actionagainst everyone who took part in this,'' said Michael Fuerst, aHanover Jewish leader.   Manfred Roething, a spokesman for the Karlsruhe prosecutor'soffice, said investigators would seek to determine ``whether otherparties may be liable for prosecution as accessories.''   In Bonn, the allegations were discussed at the regular Wednesdaymeeting of the Cabinet, said government spokesman Friedhelm Ost.   Heinz Galinski, Nachmann's successor as head of the Jewishcommunity, said he would meet with a Kohl aide, Wolfgang Schaeuble,on Friday to discuss the case.   Eberhard Braun, a court-appointed investigator who has beenexamining Nachmann's financial records, told The Associated Pressthat he had found unexplained income of $13 million in Nachmann'scompany records.   Peter Paepcke, the Nachmann family attorney, said he believesNachmann may have embezzled up to $15 million and used it tobolster his failing wholesale textile and raw materials company.   ``I had hoped in going through the records to find some causefor why this (the embezzlement) happened, even a political cause,but I couldn't find anything like that,'' he said in an interview.   Paepcke said he filed for bankruptcy March 30 for Nachmann'sheirs and his Karlsruhe-based company. He did not provide furtherdetails about a diversion of funds.   Nachmann, president of the Jewish Council from 1965 until hisdeath at age 62, was in charge of disbursing government funds toHolocaust survivors around the world.   About $236 million was allocated by the government in 1980 forHolocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations claims.   On Tuesday, Galinski said the Jewish Council had asked a civilcourt to freeze the assets of Nachmann's estate.   He said Nachmann appears to have embezzled about $6 million butsaid other reported figures were speculation.   Galinski said he first heard of the allegations April 10, but hedeclined to give further details.   Nachmann had been active in trying to help heal wounds in WestGermany left by the Holocaust, in which about 6 million Jews werekilled during Nazi rule.   Nachmann's family fled Nazi Germany to France in 1938. Hereturned to Karlsruhe in 1945 and began working towardre-establishing Jewish communities in the country.   About 530,000 Jews lived in Germany when the Nazis took power in1933. West Germany has about 30,000 Jewish residents today.</TEXT></DOC>
