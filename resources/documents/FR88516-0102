Introduction</ITAG>The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submittedon July 29, 1987, a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 19b-4 thereunderto commence a two year pilot program to test revisions to NYSE Rule 103A(``Rule''), the Exchange's Specialist Performance Evaluation and ImprovementProcess. Several important features of the revised Rule include, amongother things, the incorporation of newly developed objective performancemeasures into the Ruel 103A process, the adoption of minimum standardsfor acceptable performance, the codification of reallocation procedures,and the broadening of the Rule's performance improvement action proceduresfor below standard performance. Notice of the proposal together with its terms of substance was providedby the issuance of a Commission release (Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 24919, September 15, 1987) and by publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 35821, September 23, 1987). No commentswere received concerning the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>NYSE Rule 103A contains standards for evaluating specialist performanceand authorizes the Exchange's Market Performance Committee (``MPC'') toreallocate one or more securities assigned to a specialist unit whose performanceis consistently found to be substandard as determined by the Rule.Presently, the Exchange's primary mechanism to measure specialist performanceis its Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire (``SPEQ'').\1\<NOTE/> The SPEQ, which was revised last in 1986, is a quarterlysurvey on specialist performance completed by floor brokers. The SPEQ requiresfloor brokers to rate, and provide written comments on, the performanceof specialist units with whom they deal frequently.\2\<NOTE/> Failure by a specialist unit to achieve a specific scoreon the questionnaire as a whole or on one or more specific questions forone or more quarters constitutes unacceptable performance.\3\<NOTE/> If a specialist unit's SPEQ score, for example, falls belowthe minimum standard of acceptable performance provided in the Rule fora single quarter, the unit's performance is deemed to be substandard, and,as a result, the specialist unit is required to meet informally with theMPC to discuss its performance.\4\<NOTE/> These informal meetings between the MPC and the underperformingspecialist units are generally regarded as counseling sessions and arelargely designed to identify areas in which a specialist unit's performanceis weak as well as develop strategies to improve the unit's performancein subsequent quarters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The SPEQ currently consists of 28 questions covering fivespecific areas of specialist responsibility_the dealer, agency, communicationand administrative functions and maintenance of the auction market. Eachof these questions is rated by a floor broker on a 5 point scale, rangingfrom poor to very good. An additional question solicits general commentsfrom the evaluating floor broker regarding specific aspects of the specialistunit's performance such as the unit's ability to attract order flow tothe Exchange and retain it. In addition, the question asks the floor brokerto recommend specific steps a unit could undertake to improve its performanceand receive better ratings in the following quarter. Specialist units areranked in descending order according to their overall SPEQ scores.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\All eligible floor brokers (<T3>e.g., </T3>those floor brokers with a minimum of one year's experience)participate in the survey process. Floor brokers participating in the surveyrate the specialist unit(s) with whom they have the most contact with,as identified by audit trial data.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\<T3>But see </T3>note 4, <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\Due to recent 1985 revisions to the SPEQ, which changedthe scoring method, the former numerical standard of acceptable performancecontained in the Rule is no longer applicable. Further, the Exchange determinednot to revise the standard for acceptable performance on the revised SPEQunitl it had developed additional performance measures to supplement theexisting SPEQ and revised other aspects of the specialist performance evaluationand improvement process. Accordingly, since the implementation of the newSPEQ, results of the SPEQ have not been used as the basis for reallocations.The SPEQ is, however, used as a basis for informal counseling of specialistunits and for making allocation decisions for new listings. The prohibitionon reallocations under Rule 103A, which has been in effect for nearly twoyears and is still effective, will be terminated by the proposed revisionsto Rule 103A contained herein. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Rel. Nos. 22036 (May 14, 1985), 50FR 21007 and 23747 (October 23, 1986), 51 FR 40550.Under current Rule 103A procedures, if a specialist unit's performanceis found to be substandard for two consecutive quarters as determined bythe Rule, the MPC would issue a Supplemental Questionnaire to floor brokersto identify specific securities in which the specialist unit's performanceis unsatisfactory. The results of the Supplemental Questionnaire wouldbe utilized by the MPC to determine whether to initiate reallocation proceedingsand to determine which stock(s) assigned to the unit would be suitablefor reallocation to another specialist unit.\5\<NOTE/> If the MPC determines that the results of the SupplementalQuestionnaire warrant action, it may commence reallocation proceedings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\Alternatively, the MPC may elect to proceed directly toa reallocation proceeding without the issuance of a Supplemental Questionnaireif the unit previously has had a Supplemental Questionnaire issued on itsbehalf as a result of subpar performance.Under existing Rule 103A, reallocation proceedings would consist primarilyof a hearing in which the MPC considers all materials relevant to the specialistunit's performance, including evidence offered by the unit to support aclaim that its unsatisfactory performance is attributable to extenuatingor mitigating circumstances. Following the hearing, the MPC may eithercancel the specialist unit's registration in a particular stock(s), ordue to a showing of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, establisha specific time frame within which the specialist unit must improve itsperformance. If the specialist unit's performance has not improved sufficientlyby the end of the extended time period, the specialist unit would againbe subject to reallocation proceedings, in which case one or more of itsassigned stocks may be reallocated to another specialist unit. A specialistunit would have a right to appeal any adverse MPC decision to the NYSEBoard of Governors pursuant to Article IV, section 14 of the NYSE Constitution.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\As noted above, the SPEQ serves an additional importantfunction. Historically, SPEQ scores have been the principal criteria consideredby the Exchange's Allocation Committee in allocating newly-listed securitiesto specialist units. Accordingly, specialist units with superior SPEQ ratings(and, consequently, higher SPEQ ranks) are supposed to receive allocationawards of new listings, particularly the more lucrative, highly soughtafter listings.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Description of the Proposal  </ITAG>The NYSE's proposal to revise Rule 103A incorporates a number of recommendationsprovided by the MPC's Subcommittee on Performance Measures and Procedures(``Subcommittee''), which conducted a thorough examination of the Exchange'sspecialist performance evaluation and improvement process. The revisedRule, among other things, broadens the scope of performance improvementactions as well as incorporates newly developed objective performance measuresinto the specialist evaluation process. In addition, the revised Rule establishesminimum standards of acceptable performance. Specialist units who fallbelow these minimum standards are subject to a performance improvementaction, and, potentially, reallocation proceedings. Further, the revisedRule codifies existing reallocation procedures as well as adopts severalnew provisions in connection with the Rule 103A process.  <T3>A. Performance Improvement Action Criteria  </T3>Under revised Rule 103A, a specialist's performance is measured by a combinationof SPEQ scores and newly developed objective standards of performance.The new standards will measure specialist performance concerning stockopenings, both regular and delayed, OARS (Opening Automatic Report Service),DOT Turnaround (Designated Order Turnaround System), status requests, andmarket share. Below standard performance on any one measure will, independently,result in a performance improvement action. As described below, such asaction could result in a reallocation of a specialist's securities.\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\<T3>See </T3>discussion on performance improvement actions in Part B, <T3>infra</T3>.  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. The SPEQ  </ITAG>The proposed revisions to the Rule would not alter the existing SPEQ inany substantive fashion; rather, the proposed revisions would establishacceptable performance levels for ratings received under the Questionnaire.Under the proposal, a specialist unit would be subject to a performanceimprovement action in any case where (1) its overall median score on theSPEQ is below ``adequate'' in any one quarter (a total numerial score of117 of 225 possible points is deemed adequate); (2) its SPEQ score in thesame function is below ``adequate'' for two consecutive quarters (24 ofa total of 45 possible points in each function is deemed adequate); or(3) its SPEQ score in any two of five functions is below ``adequate'' fortwo consecutive quarters.\8\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\For example, if a specialist unit receives a score below24 in both the dealer and agency functions in one quarter and receivesa score below 24 in both the communication and administrative functionsin the next quarter, the unit would be subject to a performance improvementaction.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Openings (Regular and Delayed)  </ITAG>The NYSE is proposing to measure specialist performance at the openingin two ways. First, this performance measure would evaluate the timelinessof a specialist unit's openings for both its common and non-convertibleperferred stock relative to the Exchange's 9:30 a.m. opening. A specialistunit would be deemed to have performed unsatisfactorily in this measureif, for two consecutive quaters, it did not open, at least 90% of the time,one or more of its common or non-convertible preferred stocks by meansof an opening trade or a quotation by 9:45 a.m.\9\<NOTE/>The Exchange indicated that it views timely openings as facilitatingtransactions in securities and as contributing to the maintenance of fairand orderly markets in accordance with its obligations under the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\In calculating specialist performance in this measure,the NYSE would exclude regulatory delayed opening and those post-9:45 a.m.delayed openings that are certified in writing by a floor official as beingjustified by market conditions in the particular stock. We note the NYSEhas developed a ``Floor Official'' Exemption Form that will be used todetermine which post-9:45 a.m. openings will be excluded in measuring timelyopening performance. The NYSE has agreed to require on this form that theFloor Official provide a brief explanation of why the post 9:45 a.m. openingis justified. (<T3>See </T3>letter from Santo Famularo, Vice President, NYSE to SharonLawson, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, dated April 22, 1988(``NYSE April 22 Letter'').  Second, the NYSE would rate whether a unit's request for a non-regulatorydelayed opening was made to a Floor Official on a timely basis, based onevaluations by Floor Officials as noted on a Delayed Opening/Halt In TradingForm.\10\<NOTE/>Under proposed Rule 103A, a performance improvement actionwould be triggered whenever a specialist unit receives unfavorable FloorOfficial evaluations in 15% of its registered common stocks, or in a mimimumof 7 stocks, whichever is greater, in any one quarter.\11\<NOTE/>The timeliness of the request would be evaluated by a FloorOfficial involved and noted on a Delayed Opening/Halt in Trading Form.According to the Exchange, the timely request for the assistance of a FloorOfficial in arranging an opening contributes to the proper functioningand overall orderliness of exchange markets and may, in some instances,eliminate the need to call a delayed opening.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\Non-regulatory delayed openings generally occur due toan order imbalance in a stock. We note that the Floor Official must indicateon the Form whether a unit's request for the delayed opening was made ina timely manner.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\For example, a unit with 100 registered common stockswould be deemed to have performed unsatisfactorily and, hence, subjectto a performance improvement action, it it received 15 unfavorable FloorOfficial evaluations concerning openings in any one quater. Similarly,a unit with only 5 registered common stocks would have to receive 7 unfavorableFloor Official evaluations concerning its openings in any one quarter tobe subject to a performance improvement action.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. OARS, DOT Turnaround Performance and Status Requests</ITAG>The Exchange is also proposing to add several other specialist performancestandards. These standards will measure the timeliness of inputting OARSprice cards, DOT turnaround performance and a unit's timely response tostatus requests. The Exchange believes that these three measures are intendedto foster the efficient processing of information in regard to securitiestransactions. In terms of OARS price reports, the revised Rule would providethat substandard performance for this measure would occur in any case where,for two quarters during a rolling four quarter period, a specialist unitfails to transmit or input 90% of its OARS price reports within 10 minutesof the opening of the stock on the Exchange.The DOT turnaround performance measures a unit's ability to execute andreport post-opening market orders up to 2,099 shares through SuperDOT ona timely basis. A unit would be deemed to have performed unsatisfactorilyin this measure if it does not turn around 90% of its DOT orders in twominutes during any two quarters in a rolling four quarter period.\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ When a performance improvement action is commencedas a result of substandard DOT performance, the MPC, in establishing specificimprovement goals, and the monitoring team assisting in the developmentof an improvement plan, will be required to consider the unit's DOT orderflow per panel; the severity of DOT system malfunctions, if any; whetherthe unit is equipped with Electronic Display Books; and the assigned postspace available to the unit.Finally, with regard to status requests, this measure would assess thetimeliness of a unit's response to a member firm's inquiry as to the statusof an order from the time the specialist unit received the request throughthe SuperDot system. A unit would perform unsatisfactorily in this measurein any case where the unit does not respond to 75% of its administrativemessages received through the SuperDot system in 30 minutes during anytwo of four rolling quarters.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Market Share</ITAG>The final measure concerns market share. A specialist unit would be subjectto a performance improvement action in any case where the market sharein any stock has declined significantly for two consecutive quarters ifthe MPC determined that the decline is attributable to factors within thecontrol of the specialist unit.\1\\3\<NOTE/> The determination of a significant decline under this measurewould be based on the specialist unit's overall percentage of the totalshare volume on the Consolidated Transaction Reporting Service.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The Exchange indicates that this measure is designed to maintainand strengthen its competitive position relative to other market centers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ In this connection, the Exchange has identified a numberof factors which it believes are within the control of a specialist unit.They are (1) a unit's commission rates; (2) whether a unit takes advantageof available automated systems; (3) whether a unit is overly aggressivein breakups of block crosses; and (4) overall specialist performance. Bycontrast, the Exchange also has identified several factors which it viewsas not generally being within the control of a specialist unit such asthe proprietary interests of some member firm order suppliers with market-marketingoperations at other market centers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The rule does not contain specific standards for whatpercentage decline in a stock would be viewed as significant under thisaspect of the rule. The Commission believes development of such standardsare important and expects the NYSE to futher define what consitutes a ``significantdecline'' in market share of a stock during the pilot program for Rule103A.B. The Performance Improvement Action ProcessUnder the revised Rule, a performance improvement action would be triggered,with certain exceptions,\1\\5\<NOTE/> whenever a specialist unit's performance falls below anyperformance standards provided in the Rule. The Exchange indicates thatthe principal purpose of a performance improvement action is to provideassistance and guidance to underperforming specialist units that will enablethese units to improve their performance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ Performance improvement actions would not be commencedif a specialist unit's unsatisfactory performance is directly attributableto highly unusual or extenuating circumstances, involving factors beyondthe control of the unit, as determined by a majority vote of the MPC ona case-by-case basis. For example, failure of an Exchange system that disruptsfloor-wide trading and, consequently, contributes to a unit's poor showingin a performance measure may be considered a highly unusual or extenuatingcircumstance. Accordingly, any unit whose performance was directly affectedby the system failure may not be subject to a performance improvement action(Of course, this assumes that the unit is rated satisfactorily in otherperformance measures).Once a performance improvement action is initiated the MPC will developmeasurable performance improvement goals that the unit will be expectedto achieve to improve its performance. The MPC will then notify the identifiedunit in writing of (1) the results of the quarterly evaluations indicatingthat the unit's performance is unsatisfactory and needs to be improved;and (2) the performance improvement goals that the unit is expected toachieve to improve its performance. In addition, the MPC will invite theunit to meet with it to discuss its performance and the goals assignedto the unit.After the performance improvement goals have been identified, the MPC willselect and assign a performance improvement monitoring team to each unitinvolved in a performance improvement action.\1\\6\<NOTE/> According to the Exchange, the monitoring teams will generallyprovide the MPC with objective assessments of the progress their assignedunits have made in meeting their performance goals throughout the performanceimprovement period. In addition, the monitoring teams will be availableto assist each unit in developing strategies to achieve its designatedperformance goals.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Performance improvement monitoring teams are composedof four non-MPC members, of which two are specialists and two are non-specialists.Each member will be randomly selected from a pool of individuals nominatedby a variety of Exchange organizations and approved by the MPC to counselspecialist units in need of performance improvement actions. When appropriate,the MPC can select the non-specialist members of the monitoring team basedupon the needs of the particular unit subject to the performance improvementaction.The MPC will establish a time in which each specialist unit must developa performance improvement plan to identify strategies to meet the MPC'sperformance goals. The unit may devise its own strategies or, as notedabove, develop its strategies with the assistance of its monitoring team.The MPC will review the unit's plan and either approve the plan or modifyit.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Further, the MPC will determine a reasonable time frame (the``performance improvement period'') within which each unit subject to aperformance improvement action is expected to accomplish its performanceimprovement goals and within which the monitoring team must submit itsfinal report to the MPC on the results.\1\\8\<NOTE/> The MPC also will retain the right to impose an allocationfreeze at any time during the performance improvement period to encouragethe unit to achieve its goals.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Performance improvement periods generally will be determinedon a case-by-case basis depending largely upon the nature and degree ofa specialist unit's performnace improvement needs. According to the Exchange,it determined not to establish a uniform time period because the improvementneeds of individual specialist units vary considerably.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ All modifications recommended by the MPC to a unit'sperformance improvement plan will be binding upon the unit.During the performance improvement period, each monitoring team will berequired to monitor the performance of its assigned unit to assess theunit's progress in meeting its performance goals. At anytime during a unit'sperformance improvement period, the unit's monitoring team will be permittedto submit an interim report, at its discretion, to the MPC notifying theMPC of the unit's progress in meeting it performance goals. In the interimreport, the monitoring team may recommend that the performance improvementaction be concluded if the unit's performance so warrants; recommend thatthe unit's performance improvement plan be altered, including extendingthe performance improvement period; or, recommend the imposition of anallocation freeze designed to encourage improved specialist performance.The MPC will review the interim report, consider its recommendations, andadopt any recommendation it considers appropriate.At the conclusion of the performance improvement action, a specialist unit'smonitoring team will iissue a final report to the MPC.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The final report will contain the monitoring team's assessmentof the unit's performance, including a description of the measures takenby the unit to improve its performance and areas of continued weak performance.In addition, the monitoring team may recommend the reallocation of particularstock or stocks should it determine that a unit has failed to accomplishthe performance improvement goals established by the MPC. Alternatively,the monitoring team may recommend that a unit's performance improvementaction be extended, for a period no longer than one quarter, if it believesthat a unit's is likely to attain its performance improvement goals duringthe extended period.\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Of course, a final report will not be issued for thoseunits whose performance improvement actions were terminated during theperformance improvement period as a result of recommendations made by theirmonitoring teams in interim reports submitted to the MPC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ The monitoring team only may make this recommendationif specific performance date generated during the unit's performance improvementperiod indicates that the unit has made significant progress in reachingits performance improvement goals, but nevertheless needs additional timeto fully attain those goals.Following the monitoring team's submission of a final report to the MPC,the MPC, the MPC will review the report (including any recommendationscontained therein), the specialist unit's performance improvement plan,and the specific steps taken by the unit to improve its performance withthe overall results, to determine whether to conclude the performance improvementaction process. If the MPC determines that the unit has met its performanceimprovement goals, it will terminate the unit's performance improvementaction. On the other hand, if the MPC determines that a unit has failedto attain its performance improvement goals, the MPC will be required toinitiate reallocation proceedings or extend the performance improvementperiod, for one quarter only, to provide additional time for a unit toachieve its performance improvement goals.C. Reallocation ProceedingsThe proposed revisions to the Rule set forth the specific procedures tobe followed in reallocating stocks due to poor performance. Reallocationproceedings would be commenced in those instances in which a unit's performanceimprovement action has concluded and the MPC determines that the unit hasfailed to achieve its performance improvement goals. The MPC will thendetermine which stocks will be reallocated by considering specific performancedata that may indicate particular stocks in which the unit's performancewas deficient.\2\\1\<NOTE/> In this regard, the MPC will review some of the objectivemeasures incorporated into the Rule 103A process, such as OARS and DOTturnaround performance, to identify stocks for reallocation. Further, theExchange indicates that responses to a question on the revised SPEQ, whichsolicits the broker's comments in connection with the unit's handling ofparticular stocks, will aid the MPC in selecting suitable stocks for reallocation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ The MPC will no longer issue a Supplemental Questionnaireto determine which stocks are suitable for reallocations.Proposed Rule 103A also provides for the initiation of reallocations inemergency situations. Under the rule, in any instance where a specialistunit's performance is so egregious as to call into question the integrityor reputation of NYSE's markets, the MPC will be permitted to proceed directlyto a reallocation proceeding without intiating a performance improvementaction.The Exchange maintains that the revised Rule will continue to provide proceduralsafeguards for specialist units involved in performance improvement actionsand/or subject to reallocation proceedings. In this regard, any specialistunit subject to a reallocation proceeding will be notified in writing ofthe basis for the MPC's decision to initiate reallocation proceedings.Further, a written record of all MPC deliberations will be maintained.All written documents that will be considered by the MPC in the proceedings,including the monitoring team's report, will be provided to the specialistunit. In addition, specialist units will be afforded the opportunity toappear before the MPC. The specialist unit will also be able to presentits case as to why the selected stocks should not be reallocated and mayrequest the MPC to consider reallocation of alternate stocks. Finally,a unit would have the right to appeal any adverse MPC decision to the Exchange'sBoard of Governors pursuant to the Exchange's Constitution.\2\\2\<NOTE/> According to the Exchange, these procedures will ensure thatspecialist units that are subject to performance improvement and reallocationproceedings receive adequate due process protections.\2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\This right would extend to allocation freezes imposedby the MPC during a performance improvement action. <T3>See </T3>NYSE April 22 Letter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ The due process procedures also apply to persons subjectto reallocation proceedings because of an egregious situation. <T3>See </T3>discussion, <T3>infra</T3>.D. Additional ProvisionsAnother provision contained in the Rule addresses potential conflict ofinterests in the event of a reallocation under the revised Rule 103A. Memberorganizations directly or indirectly associated with MPC members and membersof the monitoring team appointed to assist a specific unit would be prohibitedfrom applying for any stock to be reallocated from the unit under the Rule.Finally, the revised Rule would authorize the MPC to review any performancerelated data pertaining to any unit. Pursuant to this review, the MPC wouldbe permitted, at its discretion, to provide educational counseling to aunit even though the unit has not fallen below the acceptable levels ofperformance, described above, where appropriateAs noted, the NYSE is requesting approval for a two year pilot basis. TheExchange indicates that if its proposal is approved by the Commission,it intends to notify its membership of the substance of its proposal atleast one quarter prior to implementation of the two year pilot program.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Further, the Exchange maintains that the pilot program isintended to permit the Exchange to monitor the operation of the revisedRule and its associated processes under actual conditions and to make anymodifications or amendments to the Rule as it deems appropriate.\2\\5\<NOTE/> After the evaluation period, the Exchange states that itintends to submit the proposed revisions to Rule 103A to the Commissionfor permanent approval.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ On April 4, 1988, the NYSE notified members that, subjectto Commission approval, the new evaluation program would commence the followingquarter on July 1, 1988. <T3>See </T3>NYSE Information Memorandum from Donald J. Solodar, SeniorVice President, Market Surveillance, to NYSE Specialists, dated April 4,1988. In the NYSE April 22 Letter, the Exchange notes that only the SPEQand DOT turnaround performance measures will be implemented for the July1, 1988 quarter. OARS reporting requirements and Openings Standards willnot be implemented until the fourth quarter of 1988, while the performancemeasures involving status requests and market share will not be implementeduntil the first or second quarter of 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ Any such changes would have to be submitted to Commissionfor review pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act prior to implementation.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposed revisions to the Rule are appropriateand should provide the Exchange with a viable means to monitor specialistperformance and to address continued weak performance by a specialist unit.Further, the Commission strongly supports and encourages the Exchange'sefforts to improve specialist performance and market quality through itsspecialist performance evaluation and improvement process, particularlyin light of increasingly volatile market conditions. We have reviewed theproposed revisions to the Rule and generally believe that the revised Rulewill accomplish the underlying objective of the program to improve specialistperformance and market quality. In this connection, we note that the revisedRule differs significantly, in several critical respects, from the currentRule. The Commission believes that the modifications will improve the NYSE'sspecialist evaluation process and should prove beneficial to the Exchange,its specialist community, and the investing public.First, with the incorporation of objective measures into the specialistevaluation process, the quarterly SPEQ will no longer serve as the principaltool employed to measure and evaluate specialst performance. Although theSPEQ is an adequate devise to monitor specialist performance, the Commissionhas long favored the incorporation of objective measurements into the Rule103A program as a supplemental performance measure to the floor brokerevaluations.\26\<NOTE/> The objective measures to be incorporated into the Rule 103Aprogram, when combined with the ratings on the SPEQ, should enable theMPC to assess specialist performance in a more precise and comprehensivefashion and make it easier for the Exchange to identify units with poorperformance. In addition, although the overall evaluation process is conductedquarterly, the objective measures should allow the MPC to continuouslymonitor specialist performance and to initiate remedial action, such aseducational counseling, on an ad hoc basis in appropriate cases.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> letter from Douglas Scarff, Director, Division, toJohn J. Phelan, Jr., President, NYSE, dated November 10, 1981 (``NYSE November10, 1981 letter'') and letter from Richard Ketchum, Director, Division,to Henry Poole, General Counsel, NYSE dated August 1, 1986 (``NYSE August1, 1986 letter''). <T3>See also </T3>Report by the Division of Market Regulation, United StatesSecurities and Exchange Commission, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break</T3> (1988) pg. XVII (``Division Report'');Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendations Regarding the October1987 Market Break, Before the United States Senate Committee on Banking,Housing, and Urban Affairs, February 3, 1988 (Testimony of Davis S. Ruder,Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission); Securities Exchange ActRelease No. 22577 (October 28, 1985) 50 FR 45695, (Commission order approvingproposed rule change by the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. adopting guidelinesfor the mandatory posting and reassignment of securities from specialistsand co-specialists due to substandard performance as measured by objectivemarket share data.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Although the Commission commends the NYSE's efforts toincorporate objective measures into the Rule 103A pilot, the Commissionnonetheless recommends that the NYSE incorporate objective market makingmeasures into the program. The Commission believes that minimally acceptablelevels of market making activity, such as depth, continuity, and stabilizationrates reflecting the characteristics of each security can be established.<T3>See</T3> NYSE August 1, 1986 letter. The Commission notes that similarindividualized standards have been developed by the NYSE for surveillancepurposes. During the new 103A pilot period, the Exchange should examinehow to devise market making objective standards for inclusion into theprogram. The Commission also believes that the Exchange should incorporateITS turnaround and trade-through criteria into its specialist performancestandards because of the importance performance as relating to ITS hasto intermarket access.The development of standards of minimally acceptable performance is alsoan important step in increasing the effectiveness of the NYSE's evaluationprogram. As described above, the NYSE has been unable to initiate reallocationproceedings under the revised SPEQ that has been in effect since 1986 becauseit did not establish a numerical standard for minimum levels of acceptableperformance based on the scoring system in the new SPEQ. The establishmentof minimum acceptable levels of performance for the SPEQ and the new objectivecriteria will aid the NYSE in identifying poor performance and reallocatingstocks where necessary.Despite the improvements in this area, the Commission is still concernedabout the lack of relative performance standards. The Commission prevouslyhas urged the NYSE to adopt relative performance measures so that specialistswho were regularly among the lowest ranked specialists would be subjectto performance reviews, regardless of whether their performance met a predeterminedlevel of unacceptable performance. As discussed in the Division of MarketRegulation report, The October 1987 Market Break, and in the report bythe Presidential Task Force,\28\<NOTE/> specialist performance during the October 1987 Market Breakvaried widely. This disparity underscores the need for the adoption ofrelative standards of performance. We re-emphasize that the NYSE shouldgive specific attention to developing relative standards for their newevaluation program.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See</T3> Division Report at 4-28 and 4-29, and Report of the PresidentialTask Force on Market Mechanisms, January 1988, at 49-50 and Study VI.Another important modification concerns the Supplemental Questionnaire.The Commission views the elimination of the Supplemental Questionnaireas a crucial refinement to the Rule 103A pilot. In particular, the Commissionbelieves that the Supplemental Questionnaire, which is designed to identifyappropriate stocks to reallocate following a specified period of substandardperformance on the SPEQ, can unnecessarily protract a Rule 103A proceeding.\29\<NOTE/> Under the new rules, the MPC can use objective data and responseson the SPEQ to determine which stocks are appropriate to reallocate. Withthe elimination of the Supplemental Questionnaire, the MPC can commencereallocation proceedings expeditiously without encountering any unnecessarydelays.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ The Commission has on prior occasions recommended theelimination of the Supplemental Questionnaire from the Rule 103A pilotprogram. <T3>See</T3> NYSE November 10, 1981 letter. <T3>See also</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19664 (April 8, 1983),48 FR 16155.Significant modifications also have been made in the performance improvementaction process. Among other things, the MPC will establish performanceimprovement goals tailored to specific areas of weakness for each unitsubject to a performance improvement action. The Commission believes thatthe MPC will be in the best position to establish such goals inasmuch asit reviews performance data for all specialist units and will be able toformulate appropriate goals for each unit based upon its perception ofoutstanding specialist performance. Further, the Exchange will allow specialistunits involved in performance improvement actions to participate in theprocess by allowing them to establish strategies, with the assistance oftheir monitoring teams, if needed, to meet their assigned performance goals.The MPC will, however, retain final authority in approving or modifyingthe proposed strategies of each unit.The Commission also believes that the proposal adequately provides dueprocess protection to specialists subject to a performance improvementaction and/or reallocation. As noted above, a written record of all proceedingswill be maintained. Moreover, units subject to the initiation of a reallocationproceeding will be given an opportunity to appear before the MPC to presenttheir case,\30\<NOTE/> and any decision by the MPC to reallocate a unit's stockswould be appealable to the NYSE's Board of Directors.\31\<NOTE/> Finally, MPC members, and members of the monitoring teamassigned to a unit, are prohibited from applying for a unit's stock(s)reallocated under the Rule. These procedures should adequately safeguardthe rights of specialists subject to an action for substandard performanceunder Rule 103A.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Units would also be entitled to appear before the MPCat the initiation of a performance improvement action.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ We continue to believe, as the Commission previouslyhas determined, that the reallocation of securities for unsatisfactoryperformance under NYSE rules would not constitute a disciplinary actionor prohibition or limitation of access to services offered by a self-regulatoryorganization reviewable by the Commission pursuant to section 19(d)(2)of the Act. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15827 (May 15, 1979),44 FR 29778.Finally, because results from the evaluation process will continue to beused as a basis for granting new allocations, the Commission believes thatthe revised Rule will be helpful to specialists by providing them withconcrete guidelines to continuously measure and assess their own performanceto determine whether they should take action to improve their performance.\32\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ The Commission continues to believe that the key criteriafor allocating stocks to specialist units should be specialist performanceas evidenced by the results of the Rule 103A evaluation process. This willnot only help ensure that stocks are allocated to the top specialists whowill make the best markets, but should also provide an incentive for improvedspecialist performance.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>The Commission, in approving the proposed rule change, recognizes the increasinglysignificant role played by the NYSE specialist in providing stability,liquidity, and order to exchange markets, particularly in light of therecent volatility encountered by the securities markets following the eventsof the October Market Break. Accordingly, a primary concern of the Commissionin assessing the proposed rule change has been to ensure that the revisedrule serve as a meaningful and effective vehicle to encourage improvedspecialist performance_both under normal and unusual market conditions.Further, given the events that occurred during the market break and thereafter,the Commission believes that the proposed rule's objective measurementsof specialist performance should be closely monitored to determine theireffectiveness in evaluating specialist performance under all market conditionsand to determine whether additional measures are necessary to provide anaccurate and more comprehensive assessment of specialist performance. Asnoted above, although the proposed objective criteria provides a usefulsupplement to the existing evaluation process utilizing SPEQ ratings, webelieve the NYSE should develop additional standards that would more directlymeasure specialist market making performance.In addition, the selected standards of minimally acceptable performancemust be monitored to determine whether the thresholds that trigger performanceimprovement actions are adequate.\33\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission has determined to approve the proposedrule change as requested by the Exchange with the stipulation that theExchange must submit to the Commission, one year from the date of approvalof the proposed rule change, a report containing its assessment of theimplementation of the revised Rule, any problems associated with its implementation,any proposed modifications and the reasons therefore.\34\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ As noted above, the Commission believes relative performancestandards could be more meaningful than absolute standards. The NYSE shouldgive prompt attention to developing relative performance standards, thatwould, for example, subject those units in the bottom 10% for two consecutivequarters to a performance improvement action.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ The report should contain data for each quarter, on (1)the number of specialists that fell below acceptable levels of performancefor each category (2) the number of performance improvement actions commenced(3) the number of units subjected to informal counseling to improve performance,and (4) a list of stocks reallocated due to substandard performance underthe Rule and the particular unit involved. We would also expect to receivethe same information for the second year of the pilot prior to its expiration.For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposedrule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rulesand regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,and in particular, the requirements of Section 6 and the rules and regulationsthereunder. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change significantlyenhances the Exchange's specialist evaluation process and that the proposalis likely to encourage improved specialist performance consistent withthe protection of investors and the public interest. Moreover, to the extenta unit subject to a performance improvement action does not improve, theMPC will, under the new Rule, have the ability to reallocate the stockto another unit, which will benefit all market participants.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, thatthe above-mentioned proposed rule change be, and is, hereby approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
