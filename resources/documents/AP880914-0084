In Maseru, Lesotho, meanwhile, security forces surrounded a busfilled with nuns and schoolgirls that was hijacked by armedguerrillas as it headed for a Mass to be celebrated by John Paul.   A nun today said some of the 71 captives had been released butshe did not know how many.   Official Lesotho Radio said a group of ``fanatics'' had takenover the bus Tuesday. Diplomats said the guerrillas were believedto be members of the rebel Lesotho Liberation Army.   The pope was informed of the hijacking, but made no comment.   Arriving in Johnannesburg, the pope, an outspoken critic ofSouth Africa's racial segregation policies, did not kiss theground, as he customarily does the first time he visits a country.   The pope, who is on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, spentthree hours at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport before he and hisentourage left for Lesotho in a convoy of cars and buses.   The 270-mile trip to Lesotho, a mountain kingdom completelysurrounded by South Africa, was expected to take at least fivehours.   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha greeted the pope on the stepsleading from the plane and accompanied him into a VIP lounge at theairport while security forces stood guard inside and outside theterminal.   ``We consider it a privilege to assist the Holy Father,'' saidBotha, who ordered 100 luncheons for the entourage.   The plane's pilot, Robin Cartwright, told reporters he decidedto divert the chartered Air Zimbabwe Boeing 707 flight because of alow cloud ceiling and because two radio beacons at the airport inMasera, Lesotho's capital, were out of order.   In an announcement to passengers, the pilot said conditions hadbeen unsuitable to bring the plane below the clouds. Masera airportis in a valley between 3,000-4,000-foot-high mountains.   A hard, freezing rain fell on Lesotho. King Moshoeshoe II andother officials waited at the airport for hours before theannouncement that the pope would come by road.   Lesotho was to be the third stop on a 10-day trip that has takenthe pontiff to Zimbabwe and Botswana. He also plans stops inSwaziland and Mozambique.   The Vatican said South Africa's Catholic bishops have advisedJohn Paul that this was not an appropriate time for him to visitSouth Africa.   The pope has said he would like to visit South Africa at somepoint, but the country was not mentioned when the Vatican announcedthis week that John Paul would go to Tanzania and Madagascar onanother African tour next year.   Hundreds of thousands of South Africans had been expected tocross into Lesotho to see the pope during his scheduled 48-hourvisit to the kingdom.   South Africa's Catholic bishops have been active in theanti-apartheid movement, particularly in the period since 17 majorblack opposition groups were banned in February.   The government has blamed the bishops for the pope's decision toomit South Africa from his official itinerary, and pro-governmentmedia have claimed many Catholics are angry at their leaders.   Pro-government media also tried to depict the pope as havingrepudiated Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa'sbest-known anti-apartheid cleric.   This interpretation was based on the pope's unqualifieddenunication of political violence and reservations about sanctionsand election boycotts. Tutu advocates sanctions and is urging aboycott of upcoming, segregated municipal elections.   Tutu has repeatedly condemned violence but says he understandshow some South African blacks feel they have no other alternativein seeking to end white-minority domination.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no votein national affairs, and its 5 million whites control the economyand maintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, said there are no fundamentaldifferences between the pope and the Anglican archbishop, who metearlier this year at the Vatican.</TEXT></DOC>
