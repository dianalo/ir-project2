<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0278 </DOCNO><TEXT>In a method of continuously producing ethanol from sugar-containing substrates,fermentation of sugars by means of a flocculating strain of Zymomonasmobilis is carried out under anaerobic conditions and at a pH of from4.5 to 7. A substrate is led commonly with Zymomonas mobilis cells throughat least three fermentation stages without preceding sterilization. Aconcentration of at least 4% by volume of ethanol is maintained in eachfermentation stage. A residence time of the fermentation medium in theentire system of maximally 3 1/3 h, corresponding to a dilution rateof the fermentation medium in the entire system of at least 0.3/h, isadjusted. The Zynomonas mobilies cells are separated by sedimentationafter the final fermentation stage and recycled into the first fermentationstage. Finally, the ethanol-containing substrate separated from the Zymomonasmobilis cells is drawn off.</TEXT></DOC>
