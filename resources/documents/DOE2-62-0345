Theapparatus employs the technique of dynamic resonance in which a material'smechanical resonance spectrum can be determined over a range 10/sup 2/to 10/sup 5/ Hz with resolution +-0.001 Hz. This resolution has enabledus to determine the mechanical properties of films as thin as approximately10 nm. The authors present resonance results for thin films (--100 nm)of nickel and gold on sapphire substrates. These results suggest thatnickel films on sapphire are adherent, i.e., cyclic strain is continuousat the film-substrate interface, over a range of temperature about thefilm growth temperature; whereas gold films show nonadherent behaviorat all temperatures studied.</TEXT></DOC>
