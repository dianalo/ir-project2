Continued depressed farm-equipment demand also contributed to the company's $139.7 million net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended Oct. 31.    A further loss in the first quarter is expected by several analysts. Some of them say the deficit could approach the fourth period's if the strike drags on much longer.    United Auto Worker officials say the major differences still separating the two sides revolve around job-security provisions and pensions. Negotiations have broken down three times, most recently last week after only an afternoon of discussions. No further talks are scheduled, a Deere spokesman said.    In August, the UAW struck three of Deere's facilities. The farm-equipment maker subsequently closed its remaining 10 union-represented plants, a move the union has termed a lockout. Traditionally, the company and the union follow the contract set at Caterpillar Inc. But Caterpillar's agreement, which was reached in July, couldn't be applied easily to Deere, particularly since the construction equipment maker is in a stronger market than Deere.    This prolonged strike isn't typical for Deere, which has long had good relations with the union. Indeed, until this year, the union hadn't struck the company since 1979, and then for only 20 days. But union officials say that if the strike lasts through Christmas, which they expect it to, much of the cooperation between the company and union will be lost for a long time.    &quot;Guys that respected that place, they're just coming to me saying they're all done with that mutual stuff,&quot; says Pat Dillon, president of the UAW local at Deere's Dubuque, Iowa, plant.    Only last week, members of Mr. Dillon's local marched on Deere's headquarters in Moline, Ill., nicknamed &quot;Rusty Palace,&quot; and burned &quot;Winning Team&quot; caps, which had been handed out at a jointly sponsored factory open-house in April.    But some analysts suspect that Deere, to maintain a good rapport with the union, will try to settle before Christmas. &quot;I don't think they want to get into a situation like Caterpillar or Mack with very poor relations on an ongoing basis,&quot; says Mitchell Quain, an analyst with Wertheim andamp; Co.    Last week, Deere sent a letter to the union's 18,000 members, some of whom are on temporary layoff, urging them to ask for a vote on the company's most recent contract offer. Union members overwhelmingly rejected Deere's proposal that a vote be held, union officials say. Also, according to a source, Deere has sought advice from a Chicago-based labor-law firm as to how to deal with the union.    Deere has accepted a request by UAW vice president Bill Casstevens to address the company's board tomorrow. In return, Deere chairman Robert A. Hansen has been invited to address the union's executive board. No date has been set for that encounter, a company spokesman said.    While Deere has been able to reduce its swollen inventory during the strike -- farm-equipment dealers' inventories are at the lowest level since 1980 -- some analysts expect another substantial loss in the first quarter. &quot;You'll probably get an instant replay,&quot; says Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins. Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., says that if the strike lasts through the quarter, Deere's loss for the period could exceed $140 million.    Mr. Lustgarten says the company, if it doesn't settle before the holidays, will feel pressure to reach an agreement with the union sometime in January as &quot;the losses begin to mount and (Deere) begins to run out of products to sell.&quot;    In the fourth quarter, sales dropped 29% to $818.1 million from $1.15 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, Deere posted a profit of $19.4 million, or 29 cents a share.    The latest fourth-quarter results included an after-tax inventory accounting benefit of $30.4 million, compared with $21.6 million in the year-before quarter, and an after-tax benefit of $8.1 million from the adoption of new pension accounting rules. The quarter's loss was widened, however, by an after-tax $25.4 million provision for costs relating to work-force reductions.    Deere recorded its first annual loss since 1933, and its largest annual loss ever. It reported a loss of $229.3 million, compared with profit of $30.5 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The results for the first nine months were restated to reflect the adoption of new pension accounting rules. Sales dropped 13% to $3.52 billion from $4.06 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Deere closed at $23.375, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
