The immediate effect of the new ruling ... falls short ofrepealing a woman's right to early term abortions. But the decisionshows where the court's majority stands. Here is a self-described``conservative'' majority calling for more state interference in amatter of the utmost privacy _ the question of whether to reproduce.   In short, the ruling denies abortion to those who can leastafford the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy.   Monday, July 3, a bad day for individual freedom.</TEXT><NOTE>The Philadelphia Inquirer:</NOTE><TEXT>   To hear activists on both sides tell it, yesterday marked thebeginning of the end of legal abortion in America. Such hype seemedto flow naturally from a Supreme Court decision that was deemedmomentous before a single justice set word to paper. But, truth betold, the court only marginally restricted a woman's right to anabortion and gave no clear indication that it was ready to gofurther in the next session. </TEXT><NOTE>Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.:</NOTE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court Monday acted properly in reaffirming the rightof a woman to choose an abortion. The United States cannot afford tohead down the path to back alley abortions that pose a severe threatto the lives of women.   Unfortunately, the decision also has opened the door tolegislative meddling that could impede women from exercising thatright.</TEXT><NOTE>Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock:</NOTE><TEXT>   The United States Supreme Court has left standing the right ofwomen to an abortion, but what a Pyrrhic victory for women it is andwhat a defeat for justice under law! For the American system ofjurisprudence, the court's long-awaited review of the Roe vs. Wadeabortion decision ended in the worst of all possible ways.   By encouraging states to find ways to restrict abortions, thecourt took a giant step along the course it began this decade, whichis to turn abortion from a right into a privilege of the well-to-do.The limitations always are barriers to pregnant children and poorwomen, the most vulnerable, and they clearly will soon have littlechoice to bearing unwanted babies.</TEXT><NOTE>The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star:</NOTE><TEXT>   Making abortion illegal reduces the number of abortions, yes, butit also drives abortions under ground. It does not stop them.</TEXT><NOTE>The Journal-Bulletin of Providence, R.I.:</NOTE><TEXT>   The absence of public subsidies will probably limit theavailability of abortion to some women in some places _ and to thatextent, the court will regret the social consequences of itsdecision.   But the abortion debate will not be settled in the streets. Thosewho harass and intimidate women at a painful moment in their livesgain no sympathy for their cause; and those who believe that thecourt has declared ``war against women'' fail to comprehend thisdifficult, complex problem. The right to abortion remains intact;the means to abortion are under review.</TEXT><NOTE>The Sun in Baltimore:</NOTE><TEXT>   Probably the worst ill this wind will blow is the prospect ofdivisive, ugly political warfare in state capitals. Many states nowhave or will adopt Missouri-type laws or worse. Most, we fear, willthen be upheld by the Supreme Court. We can foresee Roe v. Wadechipped away bit by bit till only a shell or a shadow remains. Ifthat.</TEXT><NOTE>The Indianapolis Star:</NOTE><TEXT>   The state _ certainly any civilized, humane state _ must have aninterest in protecting potential human life. When that interest isnon-existent, a state and a people are soon barren of ethical andmoral values.   This country has traveled some distance on that road already. Asurvey of medical geneticists taken earlier this year showed that afull 20 percent of them approved of abortion based solely on the sexof the unborn child.   When medical professionals begin to countenance the taking oflife _ even potential life _ simply because it is not the rightgender, then something is terribly wrong. And there are millions andmillions of Americans who believe that the wrong took root 16 yearsago.</TEXT><NOTE>Milwaukee Sentinel:</NOTE><TEXT>   The U.S. Supreme Court has set the stage for the worst scenariopossible in the battle over the rights of mothers and fetuses.   And it has acted in total disregard of the fact that abortionswill continue to be performed with or without legal sanction _ andwithout the health safeguards that were imposed on physicians underthe historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling establishing a woman'sconstitutional right to an abortion.   Under Monday's ruling, choice still exists. It will be up toenlightened states and legislatures to preserve it.</TEXT><NOTE>Chicago Tribune:</NOTE><TEXT>   Its ruling in the Missouri case, depicted by both sides of thedebate as a start in dismantling Roe, is really a return to thecourt's original version.   That is a healthy step. Most Americans, to judge from the polls,aren't willing to make abortion illegal. But they are troubled atseeing the matter put beyond the reach of social control. This time,the court reflected the nation's ambivalence. It left Roe intact,ignoring demands that it return to the pre-1973 status quo. But itsanctioned a few restrictions.   For the time being, and perhaps beyond, the court finds that, onabortion, it is most comfortable alongside most Americans _somewhere in the middle.</TEXT><NOTE>The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson:</NOTE><TEXT>   The court says states can erect an obstacle course between aconstitutional right and the ability to exercise that right. It saysstates can do that by codifying religious tenets into law. ... Thisis not a theocracy, despite the best efforts of Jerry Falwell, JimmySwaggart, Donald Wildmon and the like.</TEXT><NOTE>Star Tribune of Minneapolis:</NOTE><TEXT>   Less like a sculptor than a vandal, the U.S. Supreme Court hasbegun remodeling America's abortion laws. Its first chisel marks aresubtler than most spectators anticipated. ... But even a cursoryreading of Justice William Rehnquist's majority opinion reveals thelikely shape of things to come.</TEXT><NOTE>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:</NOTE><TEXT>   We would prefer to judge the Supreme Court by what it actuallyhas done in the case of Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.And, to a considerable extent, the court has been faithful to thereasoning of Roe vs. Wade.</TEXT></DOC>
