The commercials, the union's first issue-oriented national ads, don't advocate specific actions, but predict dire consequences from the current level of imports, concluding: &quot;There are solutions; we can keep America strong; we can start with an effective trade policy.&quot;    A UAW spokesman said the union was still buying air time, and didn't know the cost of the campaign.    About 1,400 union members are in Washington, D.C., this week for an annual political action conference and to lobby members of congress on a variety of issues, including trade. </TEXT></DOC>
