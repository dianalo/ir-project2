 The fatherr of computer calculation was the Polish scientistLukasiewicz, probably best known for so-called Reverse Polich Notation.andO;Another claim to fame is that a Pole, a Mr Karpinski, invented one of thefirst minicomputers 20 years ago.andP;  But karpinski's project was abandonedbecause of the political factors: it didn't fit into the Eastern (= Soviet)standards.andM;Karpinski was forced to forget his dreams and to work as a farmer for mayyears - but the story has a happier ending.andP;  With the new wave of theSolidarity movement he was able to return to his original interest.andP;  Now heruns his own company abroad and is a respectable engineer and manager.andP;  Hisstory is very typical of our older computer engineers and programmers.andM;Before the era of PCs, the only machines used in Poland were the ODRA (aPolish version of ICL 1900), RIAD (a Russian IBM 360-alike mainframe), SM-60and MERA (both based on DEC's PDP-11).andP;  These were situated in the academicinstitutions and large Government computer centres.andP;  At that time, the demandfor computer science graduates was slack.andP;  There were no economic reasons tochange this situation, as the jobs market was controlled by a few state-ownedcompanies.andM;The first wave of the computer 'madness' arrived in Poland in 1985.andP;  Almostevery technical magazine printed a short course on BASIC.andP;  Everyone wanted tobecome a programmer.andP;  The excitement only calmed down when people started tounderstand that it was impossible to write all the software they needed fromscratch.andM;Poland was flooded with hundreds of home and personal computers.andP;  The mostimportant machine of those times was the ZX Spectrum which, thanks to its lowprice and the fact that it could be exported from the West without a licence,enjoyed tremendous popularity not only among the game enthusiasts but also inthe serious scientific institutions and state companies.andP;  For people used tofighting with card punch machines, even this was a real step forward.andO;Fortunately the Spectrum soon began to give way to more serious personalcomputers.andP;  Again, price and COCOM restrictions dictated choice of machine.andO;Ninety per cent of the Polish market was cornered by cheap Taiwanese PCclones.andM;However, computers were not yet viable for everyday applications.andP;  There weretwo reasons for this.andP;  The first was cost: the price of an average PC wasapproximately equivalent to a programmer's wages for 10 years.andP;  The secondproblem was lack of software.andP;  It took about five years to reducesignificantly the price of computers - they are now worth about six month'ssalary.andP;  The shortage-of-software obstacle was simply overcome by the oldCommunist government, which chose not to introduce any software copyrightlaws.andM;All kinds of software were copied freely.andP;  This situation had someadvantages.andP;  Few companies and developers could afford to pay the full pricefor the software, as Western software houses didn't discount their productswhen selling in Poland.andP;  However, there were big drawbacks as well.andP;  Polishsoftware developers could not sell their products.andP;  Anything that reached themarket was instantly pirated.andP;  We hope that this situation will change soon,when our Parliament sets a new copyright law.andP;  For the time being, most ofthe programs sold in Poland are protected by various software and hardwarekeys.andM;In 1990, with the easing of COCOM restrictions, a second wave of computerequipment started to come to Poland.andP;  Even though PCs continue to dominate,an ever greater variety of systems is penetrating the Polish market.andP;  Thereare VAXs, Unisys machines, ICLs, IBMs and others.andP;  Lack of software to run onthem remains a major problem.andP;  We have a large number of a talentedprogrammers, but most applications wtill have to be written from scratch.andO;There are some attempts to customise Western products, but until Polishregulations become more 'European' it will remain a Sisyphean task.andM;Recently, some Polish software companies have entered into partnerships withWestern developers.andP;  This kind of cooperation should bring mutual benefits.andO;First, it can help to solve the problems with the lack of manpower in someWestern countries.andP;  Second, it may cut down the development costs up to fivetimes.andP;  Finally, it may help to decrease the technological gap between Westand East.andM;Richard Sadowski has run a private computer company 'Studio UslugKomputerowych SAMBA' since 1986.andP;  The company is both a computer dealer andsoftware house.andP;  Notable products include a suite of programs for civil andmechanical engineering, and it is working on various business applicationsand CASE products intended for a wider market.andP;  The author can be reached on010 4858 217088 or fax 010 4858 204940.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
