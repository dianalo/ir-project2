(products).andO;Product:   USVideo TVGA (Graphics board)USVideo Genlock Overlay Module (Graphics board).andO;Topic:     Video BoardsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>USVideo Inc.andM;TVGAandM;As one of two boards reviewed that can key on any displayed VGA color, theTVGA (The Original NTSC Recordable Video Card) with Genlock Overlay Moduleappears to be a good choice.andP;  However, it supplies an NTSC VGA signal ratherthan a true VGA signal when in overlay mode, and it requires that theoperational mode be set prior to turning on the computer, thereby limitingthe board somewhat.andM;Surprisingly, the board is only supplied with 256K bytes of memory, ratherthan 512K bytes.andP;  USVideo typically does not offer the memory upgrade as anoption, but it is available from most dealers at a nominal cost.andM;The TVGA requires two slots, as its daughterboard, which contains the GenlockOverlay Module, covers the adjacent expansion-slot connector.andM;PC Week experienced problems with the board supplied for review, and areplacement board showed similar symptoms after extensive testing.andM;A three-position toggle switch on the back of the board selects the operatingmode.andP;  In the down position, the board is just a VGA board.andP;  In the topposition, the VGA graphics are output on the video out connector.andP;  Thecentral position is used for overlaying VGA graphics onto the video inputsignal.andM;The board loses two columns at the right of the screen with the overlaid VGAsignal.andM;When in overlay mode, the VGA graphics are displayed in NTSC interlaced modeon the VGA monitor, and the TV monitor shows the VGA graphics and live video.andO;The NTSC VGA signal is not usable for long periods of time due to flicker.andO;In addition, using a MultiSync monitor that can accommodate NTSC signals ispreferable.andM;The TVGA is supplied with a variety of high-resolution VGA drivers.andP;  However,these are not for use in overlay mode.andM;The supplied memory-resident program controls the signal sent to the TVmonitor: to display VGA video only; NTSC live-video only; overlaid VGA andlive video; or Genlock VGA video, which is synchronized with the incomingvideo sync pulses.andM;The memory-resident program controls two other features: The VGA graphics caneither be output in color or in black and white; and the key color can bechanged either by typing the color's corresponding number or by using arrowkeys on a scroll bar that scrolls through all the VGA colors.andP;  Also, a mouseprogram allows key color changes to be made by using the mouse to point at acolor on the screen.andM;The font displayed by the TVGA operating in overlay mode is different fromthat displayed in VGA mode.andP;  As with Willow Peripherals' VGA-TV GE/O, thefont has the appearance of a CGA font, with each pixel in a character beingreplicated vertically.andP;  This improves the overlaid image as each pixel isscanned into both the odd and even scan lines, which reduces flicker.andM;The documentation notes that the best quality overlaid image is obtained withthe VGA monitor disconnected.andP;  With no video input and the toggle switch setin overlay mode, the image jumps horizontally every couple of seconds.andM;Although the product offers the ability to change key colors, PC Week testingraised concerns about the reliability of the TVGA.andM;USVideo Inc. can be reached in Stamford, Conn., at (203) 964-9000.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;Todd Gabler, managing general partner for Modern Media Consulting, in ParkCity, Utah, uses USVideo's TVGA to produce graphics for weather reports andsporting events.andM;He said the TVGA suited his needs at a reasonable cost.andP;  &quot;With the TVGA, thePC can provide a sophisticated character-generation method,&quot; he said.andM;Gabler did encounter some problems with the first board that was shipped tohim, but he said now he is particularly happy with the TVGA and its GenlockOverlay Module.andM;&quot;If you don't have this [module], you can't run it through a video switcher,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;It makes the product much stronger.&quot;andM;When Gabler used only the NTSC card, he said he encountered some ambientsignals that caused interference.andP;  The Genlock option makes the signal clean,he said.andM;While the Magni Systems VGA Producer offered more control options, accordingto Gabler, he explained that his television equipment already provided manyof these capabilities.andM;&quot;Community broadcasting will be looking at this [technology] in a seriousway,&quot; Gabler said.andP;  &quot;A 286, an 80M-byte hard drive and the TVGA can run asmall television station.andP;  The power is incredible, and the cost is so low.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
