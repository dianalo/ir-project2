The department made its 1989 year-end review under a 1978law requiring foreigners to register U.S. agricultural landholdings. As of Dec. 31, 1989, about 12.9 million acres ofagricultural land were owned by foreigners, an increase of263,273 acres from a year earlier.   &quot;Foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land remainedrelatively steady from 1981 through 1989, slightly above orbelow 1% of the privately owned agricultural land in theU.S.,&quot; said John Lee, administrator of the agency.Corporations owned 81% of the foreign-held acreage;partnerships, 10%; and individuals, 7%. The remainder is heldby estates, trusts, associations, institutions and others.   The state of Maine has the heaviest concentration offoreign ownership, with holdings of almost 2.1 million acres.                                                                                                          TOKYO'S RICE POLICY                                                                                                          Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said his nationwould maintain a ban on rice imports to protect domesticgrowers despite U.S. demands for improved market access.&quot;Rice and rice cultivation have a special significance forour country and in light of this we will continue to adhereto the basic policy of self-sufficiency,&quot; Mr. Kaifu toldlegislators. Japanese consumers pay up to six times worldprices for domestic rice as the government props upinefficient rice producers with substantial subsidies.                                                                                                          SWEDISH-HUNGARIAN DEAL                                                                                                          Sweden's largest newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, said itintends to buy a 45% stake in Magyar Nemzet, Hungary'ssecond-largest newspaper. Dagens Nyheter said itsnegotiations are with the Hungarian state-owned publisherPallas, which owns Magyar Nemzet. According to the deal,Dagens Nyheter and Pallas will own 45% each of the stock ofthe newly formed newspaper corporation. The remaining 10%will be controlled by a journalist organization. DagensNyheter wouldn't reveal the price of the deal.                                                                                                          CHINESE AID FOR LIBYA                                                                                                          China will send 350 technical advisers to Libya's MisurataIron andamp; Steel Complex, the official China Daily said. Thetechnicians will work in hot and cold rolling mills and asteel-smelting shop, the paper said. They will join 430Chinese workers and engineers already working in other partsof the Libyan complex. The Chinese workers come from theWuhan Iron andamp; Steel Complex in central China.

It is thesecond development company to quit the area this year.   Announcing the Stanhope decision, the London DocklandsDevelopment Corp. blamed the &quot;continuing deterioration of theproperty market.&quot; Redevelopment of the area, formerly thesite of the decaying docks in London's East End, has beenspotlighted by the Thatcher government as a showcase for thebenefits of free enterprise; but it has been hard hit forover a year by high base bank-interest rates, which haveundermined property values.   At the start of this year, the development companyRosehaugh PLC, which had been in partnership with Stanhope inthe Royal Docks project, announced it was quitting. The260-acre Royal Docks project for a shopping center, businesspark and leisure complex was one of the largest developmentsites in London.   &quot;The (Stanhope) withdrawal leaves in tatters the LondonDocklands Development Corp.'s plans to regenerate one of themost neglected areas of the East End,&quot; the Times of Londoncommented.
