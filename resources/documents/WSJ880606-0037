The Swiss company made its announcement after the market closed Friday, but speculation of the company's impending move sent stocks of Bristol-Myers Co. and Abbott Laboratories Inc. skidding in heavy trading early in the day.    Bristol-Myers stock closed at $41.25, down $1.50, on volume of about 1.7 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. Abbott Laboratories closed at $45.125, down $1.875, on volume of more than 3.4 million shares on the Big Board.    Nestle, a manufacturer of chocolate and confectionery and pharmaceutical products, said its U.S. unit, Carnation Co., will introduce &quot;a breakthrough medical product to launch its Nutritional Production division.&quot; Timm Crull, president and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles-based subsidiary, said the company will discuss details at a news conference July 14.    The company declined to give further details, and its short announcement came only after analysts began to lower their ratings on New York-based Bristol-Myers and Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories. Analysts said they had learned informally of Nestle's planned move from company officials during its meetings with analysts in New York and Boston.    Ronald Nordman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said Nestle executives confirmed that the company is test marketing an infant nutritional product and that the company would be &quot;most interested&quot; in marketing a milk-based hypoallergenic product. &quot;This is a real revolutionary product, because now hypoallergic infants have to be given soybean and other non-milk-based products,&quot; said Mr. Nordman. According to Nestle, he said, hypoallergenic products account for a third of the infant formula market.    Mr. Nordman said &quot;it's logical&quot; that Nestle will follow up with a regular infant formula product. &quot;But it makes sense to start with a revolutionary new product that's different from other products currently in the market,&quot; he said.    Analysts said another significant aspect of Nestle's new product will be that it will be marketed directly to consumers, through various promotional programs. Most infant formula marketing currently is aimed at physicians and hospitals. &quot;Infant formula products have been price-insensitive in the U.S. because it is the pediatricians who tell mothers what to buy. Nestle's focus will be that mothers will make the decision,&quot; said Larry Feinberg, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    According to Mr. Feinberg, Abbott Laboratories, whose brands include Similac and Isomil, accounts for about 55% of the infant formula market; Bristol-Myers, with Enfamil and ProSobee, has about 35%; and New York-based American Home Products Corp., which markets SMA, has about 10%. Mr. Feinberg said that based his information, Nestle apparently will aim to get 25% to 30% of the market. &quot;It's going to come out of the hide of the other companies,&quot; he said.    Before Nestle's announcement, Drexel Burnham on Friday had lowered its recommendations on Abbott and Bristol-Myers to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy.&quot;    PaineWebber's Mr. Nordman said his firm, which lowered its recommendations on the companies to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;attractive&quot; about three months ago, didn't lower the recommendations further. He said both companies have enough flexibility to maintain their current overall growth rates at least for the next two years. </TEXT></DOC>
