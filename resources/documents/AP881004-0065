Mithileshwar Singh, a Beirut university professor who is a legalresident of the United States, was turned over to the U.S.ambassador to Syria in Damascus today after being freed in Lebanonon Monday.   Bob Hall, a White House press duty officer, said PresidentReagan ``has been kept aware of events'' during the night.   In a prepared statement read to reporters, Hall said, ``We arepleased at the announcement that Mr. Singh has been freed by hiscaptors.   ``We are obviously happy for him, his family and friends. Ourpleasure at his release is tempered by the knowledge that nineinnocent Americans are among those still held hostage in Lebanon,''the statement read.   Singh, in a brief session with reporters at the Syrian ForeignMinistry in Damascus today, said the three American educators whowere abducted with him were the only other hostages he saw in hiscaptivity.   American diplomats who took custody of Singh were hoping thefreed hostage could give them information about the nine Americansstill held in Lebanon.   ``We are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has anyinformation to share with us about the welfare of the hostages whoremain,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said onMonday.   Nine Americans and eight other Westerners, including TerryWaite, an emissary of the Anglican church in England, are believedliving in captivity in Lebanon.   Sources in Syria's Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Singh was greeted at the ministry at 11 a.m. EDT byU.S. Ambassador Edward Djerjian and Syrian Minister of State forForeign Affairs Nasser Qaddour.   Mrs. Oakley said Singh would be questioned in Damascus byDjerejian and other American diplomats. They also were to determineif he wanted to be treated at an American military hospital inWiesbaden, West Germany, she said.   ``We join with Mr. Singh's relatives in rejoicing in his releaseand call for the urgent, unconditional release of all hostages inLebanon,'' Mrs. Oakley said.   Mrs. Oakley steadfastly denied the United States had negotiatedwith Iran.   However, she said the United States tried to maintain contact inLebanon ``with as broad a group as possible.'' Mrs. Oakley refusedto elaborate, saying ``I am not getting into the details on all theexact contacts.''   Syrian forces are in effective control of areas of Lebanon, awar-torn country in which Americans have been the target ofterrorists. Except for a few diplomats, U.S. citizens are understrict instruction from the State Department to keep away.   Singh was believed to have been held by the Islamic Jihad, apro-Iranian group. Mrs. Oakley said she could not provide anydetails of his captivity, condition or circumstances of his releaseuntil he was questioned by U.S. diplomats in Damascus.   The U.S. official said Syria had notified the U.S. Embassy inBeirut and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is at theUnited Nations in New York, of Singh's release.   Singh is a 60-year-old visiting professor at Beirut UniversityCollege.   Asked if there were indications other hostages would bereleased, Mrs. Oakley said: ``No. This is all we have.''   Singh's wife, Lalmoney, was in Beirut.   Although he is an Indian citizen, Singh was connected to theUnited States because he was a permanent resident and ``wasassociated'' with the Americans who taught at the Beirut college.   The release came after kidnappers holding Singh and threeAmerican teachers said they would free one of their captives at thewest Beirut headquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency forPalestinian refugees.   The announcement that a hostage would be freed from IslamicJihad for the Liberation of Palestine came in a 36-word handwrittenstatement in Arabic delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.   President Reagan created a stir in New York last week when hesuggested that something was in the works regarding the nineAmericans held hostage by various pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.   He said at the time that he could not say anything furtherbecause ``you don't talk while a no-hitter is being pitched.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later that thepresident had no special information and was merely saying hedidn't want to cast bad luck on the situation.   Neither Reagan nor Fitzwater would speculate on possible motivesbehind such a hostage release.</TEXT></DOC>
