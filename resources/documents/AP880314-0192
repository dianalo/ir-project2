A Defense Department official who requested anonymity said Armyofficials were convinced the new uranium-laced plates were so muchstronger than conventional steel that they could stop all types ofammunition used by Soviet tank guns.   The Army insisted that the depleted uranium would pose no threatto either the soldiers who operated the tanks or to the productionworkers who built them because of the manner in which the tankswould be fabricated.   ``The armor design modification to the M-1A1 incorporatessteel-encased depleted uranium,'' the Army said in a statement.``Sealed within the tank, depleted uranium has a very low level ofnatural radiation, which is well within the acceptable rangeestablished by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.''   The service said it had begun on Monday briefing the roughly5,000 production workers who assemble the tanks about the newmodifications. The Abrams is made for the Army by the GeneralDynamics Corp. at two plants _ in Lima, Ohio, and Detroit, Mich.   While attempting to alleviate fears about radiation, the Armymade clear that it attached a high priority to building the newversion of the M-1A1. Production is starting immediately, theservice said, and the new armor ``represents a significantenhancement of U.S. conventional defense capabilities.''   ``This improvement culminates several years of research anddevelopment to meet recent and continuing improvements in WarsawPact anti-armor weapons and will allow the Abrams to meet theanticipated threat well into the 1990s,'' the Army said.   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, said the new armor platingnow going into production would begin showing up on the tankmanufacturing lines early this summer. The first completed tankwith the new armor should be delivered in October, the spokesmanadded.   Soucy declined to say where the armor plating was being producedor to discuss the extent to which conventional armor plates arestrengthened by incorporating depleted uranium.   Depleted uranium is an inert, heavy metal that is unusuallydense. The term ``depleted'' means the uranium does not havesufficient energy to be used for commercial purposes such as in apower plant. The Navy, Air Force and Army are already usingdepleted uranium to fashion certain types of ammunition.   In the case of the M-1A1, the Army refused to say how muchuranium would be incorporated into each tank; where on the tankbody the armor with uranium would be located, or how it wouldproduce the new armor.   Service officials who asked not to be named, however, said thenew process involved ``weaving'' a thread mesh of uranium into theregular steel armor plating at the time of casting.   ``While depleted uranium has a low level of natural radiation,our tests have confirmed that this material _ as installed in theAbrams _ will involve no appreciable health threat,'' the Army said.   ``You would receive less radiation sitting on the surface of thetank than you would receive when flying during a trans-Atlanticflight. Because of this low exposure, no special precautions arerequired when near the tank.''   The Army has already acquired about 1,500 M-1A1's and they willnot be retrofitted with the new armor, the service said. But theremaining 3,000 tanks scheduled for purchase will incorporate thenew armor, the Army added.   ``The majority of the improved tanks will be stationed in Europewhere they can most directly contribute to NATO defenses,'' theservice said. The first should arrive ``late this year.''</TEXT></DOC>
