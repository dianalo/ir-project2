The latest government data douse fears of overheating, but a downturn isn't in sight. Interest-rate rises are in abeyance. The summer oil price drop will hold down inflation for a few months. Unemployment, after an August jump, could drift lower in September and October for technical reasons.    The trend is good news for Bush. In addition, third-quarter GNP, to be reported two weeks before the election, will benefit from some statistical wizardry. The Commerce Department, for reasons it insists are nonpolitical, has allocated most of this year's drought damage to the second and fourth quarters. The new adjustment to the trade data also brightens the picture.    One possible cloud: A long-predicted collapse of the Japanese stock market could panic U.S. markets.    PERILS OF PAKISTAN: Uncertainties after Zia's death spur U.S. concerns.    Election of a new president still seems likely in November, and political parties may even be allowed to campaign. What U.S. officials fear is an election free-for-all that could stir so much chaos that the military will again step in. Opposition leader Bhutto isn't necessarily helped by Zia's demise. Zia's role in executing Bhutto's father had been a rallying point for her backers.    Zia's absence also could weaken Pakistan's aid to Afghan rebels, U.S. officials worry. New leaders might balk at supplying more weapons in the face of Soviet pressure. Already undercut is Afghan fundamentalist rebel leader Hekmatyar, a Zia favorite. But so far, Pakistan's support holds despite air raids on its territory from Afghanistan.    SOLID SOUTH? Bush strategists envision a near sweep of Dixie.    Dukakis seems to have halted the Bush momentum nationally, but setbacks in the South may be permanent. Bush aides contend Dukakis is competitive only in Texas and Arkansas. Florida, once considered a Democratic target, &quot;is one of our biggest leads,&quot; says Bush pollster Teeter. Republicans say Dukakis already is pulling resources out of the South.    Democrats concede the attacks on Dukakis's defense stands and patriotism have hurt most in the South. But Dukakis advisers think this week's tougher-on-defense themes will help. They count on aid from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Nunn, still angry over Bush's role in the defense-bill veto. Some Democrats even believe a Dukakis upset is possible in Nunn's home state of Georgia.    The Bush camp is confident enough even about Texas that Bush will curtail efforts there in favor of California.    NEXT EXCUSE? Marilyn Quayle, defending her husband's mediocre academic record, told an interviewer last weekend that FDR &quot;failed the bar exam seven times.&quot; Yesterday, Sen. Quayle picked up the same line, saying that Roosevelt flunked &quot;a number of times.&quot; Untrue, say FDR scholars and the Roosevelt Library; they say FDR took the exam only once, in 1907, and passed.    BUSH UNVEILS a new theme to keep Dukakis on the defensive: the &quot;Massachusetts Mirage.&quot; He charges that the state's economy under Dukakis has actually lost manufacturing jobs and sunk into a &quot;budgetary Three Mile Island.&quot; Aides plan to hit the issue hard and inject it into the first debate. Dukakis denies the charge.    SHADES OF SPEAKES: Former NSC consultant Michael Ledeen says in a new book that he translated words Reagan never said in dealings with Italy after the 1985 Achille Lauro incident. Ledeen says he interpreted Reagan as insisting that Italy arrest four terrorists though Reagan, &quot;forgetting or unaware&quot; of plans, actually didn't.    SAY WHAT? Lobbying memos to the Bahamas from Black, Manafort andamp; Stone, the influence-peddling firm that has supplied several top Bush advisers, suggested a &quot;First Ladies {sic} Drug Abuse Conference&quot; to counter the island's drug-tainted image. U.S. officials believe that Bahamian Prime Minister Pindling has taken payoffs from big drug dealers.    NUCLEAR ENERGY gets renewed attention amid fears of global warming.    Warnings that power plants burning coal and oil add to the greenhouse effect spur some nuclear skeptics in Congress to rethink their stands. Even some environmentalists privately talk of a re-evaluation. After years of decline, &quot;the nuclear industry is starting to really count on this to change things,&quot; says Chris Neme of the Center for Clean Air Policy.    The industry improves reactor designs. Colorado Sen. Wirth, never a nuclear-power fan, proposes $500 million for safety research. The Senate easily passed a bill to streamline the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by replacing its five members with one administrator. But opposition to nuclear plants remains strong.    Nuclear power &quot;is still an appalling alternative,&quot; declares Joseph Goffman, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund.    MINOR MEMOS: Bushspeak: The vice president declares that his top goal will be to &quot;make sure everybody who has a job wants a job.&quot; . . . Interior Chief Hodel draws flak over the Yellowstone Park fire from area residents who call the blaze &quot;Hodel's holocaust.&quot; . . . Regarding a possible Elvis Presley stamp, Postmaster General Frank notes that anyone so honored must be &quot;demonstrably dead&quot; for 10 years. </TEXT></DOC>
