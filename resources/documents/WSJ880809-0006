Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> NEW ORLEANS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush, underscoring a strategy that will characterize his early campaign for president, told Republican platform writers here that they must draft a document as specific as the Democrats' was vague.    Seeking to put his lately lagging effort on the offensive, Mr. Bush lashed out at the Democrats for what he called their &quot;campaign of concealment&quot; and for writing their platform as a &quot;document of deceit.&quot; To laughter and applause, he called his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, &quot;the stealth candidate,&quot; a reference to the Air Force bomber that is hard to see on radar.    &quot;His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the radar screen,&quot; he said.    The vice president, who will officially get his party's nomination next Wednesday, sought to contrast the fuzziness of the Democrats' policies with the newfound specificity of his own. Over the past month or so he has outlined proposals on subjects ranging from strategic defense to day care, and he reprised them yesterday for the platform writers.    These, he said, are distinctions that will make a difference in the fall election. Through their vagueness, he contended, the Democrats are &quot;trying to wrap their liberalism in more-conservative clothing.&quot; He said it was his intention to expose them.    &quot;We have to make these differences clear,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not clear now.&quot;    For their part, Democrats say they are merely borrowing a page from the political text of Ronald Reagan, who twice ran successfully on mostly high-sounding themes and principles. They also say many of Mr. Bush's proposals are less specific than he makes them sound, particularly his &quot;flexible freeze,&quot; a nonspecific deficit-reduction plan.    But some Democrats are beginning to question whether Mr. Dukakis's assiduous avoidance of detailed proposals could be ceding ground to the Republicans, especially as Mr. Bush bashes them and unveils alternatives of his own.    The 106-member platform committee will write its document this week. Mr. Bush's unusual appearance before the panel seeks to assure that the platform can be used as a tool in his strategy of defining his positions and unmasking the Democrats'. The Republican National Convention, which convenes here next week, is expected to provide more of the same, though orchestrated for prime-time TV.    Mr. Bush denied that the tack is, at heart, a negative campaign, designed to cut down his adversary, who has been leading in public-opinion polls. Yet some of his rhetoric was decidedly harsh.    &quot;Does America really want to tempt recession at home and aggression abroad by inviting an inexperienced hand to recycle failed policies that threaten to smother our economy and frighten our allies?&quot; he asked. On the issue of nuclear disarmament, he added, &quot;My opponent has been silent at best -- and unsteady at worst.&quot;    In the course of the speech, Mr. Bush reminded his audience of the positions he has taken in recent weeks, some of which are different from President Reagan's. He said he favored reducing the top tax rate on capital gains, establishing a refundable tax credit for child care used by low-income families, restoring some tax breaks for the oil-and-gas industry, quickening the pace of toxic-waste cleanup and imposing the death penalty for violent crimes, among others. He also repeated, &quot;I won't raise your taxes, period.&quot;    Some of Mr. Bush's &quot;specifics&quot; lacked specificity, such as his call for &quot;vigorous enforcement of trade laws.&quot; And a big chunk of his speech wasn't about his ideas at all, but was an attack on the Democrats' policies, or rather, what Mr. Bush said were their policies. &quot;Their true intentions,&quot; he said, are &quot;to raise taxes, to weaken our defenses, {and} to unleash a flood of budget-busting spending.&quot;    Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan aren't scheduled to appear together at the convention next week, although Mr. Bush said a joint appearance would be good for him and suggested he would be open to a change. </TEXT></DOC>
