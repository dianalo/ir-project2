AffectedFederal agencies are now in the process of modifying their radiationprotection standards accordingly. In the case of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC), extensive participation by interested members of thepublic is involved in this process. A major revision of the NRC basicstandard, 10 CFR Part 20, has been published for public comment. Morethan 800 comment letters were received. All of these comments are beingcarefully considered, and adoption of many of them will be recommendedby the NRC staff. Rationales for decisions regarding the comments willbe made available to the public in a Federal Register Notice which willpublish the new regulation in the final form, scheduled for late 1988.Major concerns expressed by the commenters are the relatively high costsassociated with implementing the proposed regulations and the relativelylow potential for associated reductions in risk; these factors resultin an unfavorable cost-benefit ratio. Other basic concerns include unnecessarycomplexity and the need for training to facilitate the transition process.A national transition education program is being planned by the HealthPhysics Society under which specially prepared textbooks and videotapes,at three different levels of technical difficulty (health physicists,health physics technicians, management personnel), are to be used. Theywill be highly focussed to include instructions regarding only the changesthat are being made, and they are to be sufficiently general for applicabilityto all activities involving personnel exposures to ionizing radiation.(Abstract Truncated)</TEXT></DOC>
