No, I hadn't, but I did.andM;A couple more phone calls later, I discovered that it was indeed Border TVthat had actually made the programme.andP;  I was even given the name of thedirector.andP;  I tried calling him a couple of times, but he was busy.andP;  In theend, I typed a Fax message, printed it out and went next door to send it.andO;The next afternoon, a reply came.andP;  I now know the singer's name.andP;  I can nowlook up his discography in another catalogue, at a local record shop.andP;  Thevwill then be able to order the record for me, I hope.andP;  Another recent questfor information concerns mv search for technical data regarding smooth pixelscrolling on EGA and VGA: monitors.andP;  I was struggling with all the textbooks,and wanted more details.andP;  There were two places I knew that would haveinformation.andP;  Sitting at mv office PC, I tvped a single command.andP;  Thisscanned through 2 vears'of.EXE Magazines, which I have on mv hard disk.andP;  Itpulled out a couple of references, but I reallv wanted more.andP;  I changesd fromdrive C to drive E. This is my CD-ROM drive, which contains Computer Librarv.andO;This essential accessorv contains a year's worth of computer magazines fromthe US and the UK.andP;  In the 550 MB of data on the disk is the full text ofaround 30 titles, and extracts from around 120 more.andP;  I asked the system tosearch for all ocurrences of SMOOTH and SCROLL within the same sentence and,within half a minute, I had the titles of dozens of suitable articles.andP;  Acouple of menu selections later, I had the full text of 2 detailed articles,along with accompanying program listings, copied to my own hard disk in plainASCII format.andP;  I could now search the files, and read the information that Iwas looking for.andP;  So far, my search for the Scottish folk record has taken acouple of weeks of intermittent phone calls, visits to record shops andharassing busy people.andP;  My record player is still hungry.andP;  My pixel scrollingroutines, on the other hand, are coming along well.andP;  The search through atotal of almost 1800 magazines took about 20 minutes, and there are lots moredial-up databases I could have tried if my local selection had not had theinformation I required.andP;  n years ago, various big companies tried to set upcomputer databases for ublic access.andP;  There would, we were told, be acomputer terminal in every home 1990 or so.andP;  There would be no need forprinted telephone directories, trips to grocer and so on.andP;  The French havemanaged it, to a certain extent, but Britain not.andP;  If the InformationRevolution is really going to happen, and be accessible more than just alucky few, it will be up to software developers like us to bring t about.andO;There is, though, still much to be done.andP;  Meanwhile, if you have a listingArchie Fisher's recordings, please drop me a line.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
