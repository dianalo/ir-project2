The American Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange andother New York commodities futures exchanges suspended trading forthe rest of the day following the early afternoon power failure.   Many financial brokers and dealers had to curtail or suspendoperations and others simply told workers in the affected area toleave for the day after power failed at about 1:15 p.m.   ``Except for a skeleton crew, everybody's heading home,'' saidSteven Faigen, spokesman for Shearson Lehman Brothers, one of thebiggest Wall Street investment firms.   Shearson and other major brokerages still kept traders on thefloor of the New York Stock Exchange, which was unaffected by thepower outage. But the volume of trading slowed.   A substation fire caused the outage, which affected much ofsouthern Manhattan's Wall Street area, the World Trade Center andWorld Financial Center, headquarters of many of the nation'sbiggest financial businesses. Con Edison, New York's electricalutility, said it wouldn't restore power for hours.   The outage also briefly disrupted operations at Dow Jones, whichpublishes the Wall Street Journal and operates a financial newswire service. Spokesman James Ambrosio said the news wire stoppedfor about 30 minutes and the company was operating on emergencybackup power.   The fire at Con Ed's Seaport substation began shortly afternoon, said utility spokesman Dan Walden.   ``It knocked out some high voltage cables serving the area,''Walden said, initially affecting 500 customers. Two other feedercables became overloaded and were also knocked out, causing theblackout to spread.   ``I can't say for sure how many now. But it's going to besubstantially more than 500,'' Walden said.   Concern that continued electrical usage by other customers wouldoverload feeder cables and knock out additional networks, promptedCon Ed to issue an emergency plea for immediate cutbacks.   ``It's imperative that other customers cooperate,'' Walden said.   The cause of the fire, which was not under control more than anhour after it began, was not immediately known. The fire alsoaffected some subway service in the area, the Transit Authoritysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
