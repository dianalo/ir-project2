(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The seedy digs of old Moldovanka, homefor most of the century to crime bosses and legendary tales ofbanditry, have been razed and replaced by mournful rows of standardgray Soviet apartments.   Italian Street, where Genoa merchants built grand homes in thelast century, is now named for Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Thecrumbling mansions house state museums and foreign tourists.   Languid clerks dole out sugary fruit juice in the bars along theBlack Sea waterfront, where sailors and stevedores drank andbrawled for 150 years.   The body of old Odessa is decaying and neglected, but looks aredeceiving. The soul of the Ukrainian city known as the ``Mama'' ofdealers, drifters and orphans in the 1920s still spills vice fromdarkened recesses into the open marketplace.   ``You can get anything at the weekend markets _ foreigncurrency, liquor, drugs, even prostitutes,'' said Yuri, a32-year-old black marketeer who keeps his thumbnails long to aid indispensing cocaine.   Teen-agers in jean jackets and designer sweat shirts bought onthe black market flood a slot-machine parlor at the boat terminal.Heavily rouged prostitutes in leather skirts approach foreignsailors and well-heeled locals entering the International MerchantMarine club on Rosa Luxemburg Street. Shell-game swindlersclustered around the ``Privoz,'' the central market grounds, drawcircles of suckers, supporters and ringers.   Three young men encountered during a stroll under the chestnuttrees of Deribasovskaya Street say their city is safer now in thepast, when their mothers and grandmothers were afraid to walk aloneafter dark.   ``But everything is still for sale here,'' observed one of thesportily dressed students. ``Odessans are just naturalbusinessmen.''   Housewives out for their daily shopping brazenly approachforeign tourists to inquire whether they have jeans, cosmetics oranything else to sell.   The state-run press says Odessa is the door through which mostcontraband enters the Soviet Union, and city officials reluctantlyconcede it is true.   Deputy Mayor Galina Izuvita blames lax security in checking thecargo of incoming ships. ``In this respect we are envious of citiesthat do not have ports through which drugs can enter,'' Ms. Izuvitasaid.   Port manager Nikolai Pavliuk, who has worked in the harbor for28 years, counters: ``Never has anyone been found to have takenpart in illegal transit of contraband.''   But to Sasha, a 30-year-old construction worker and drug dealer,``Odessa is still Mama.''   At a darkened cafe, Sasha surreptitiously gulped cognac from acoffee cup and fanned a wad of several thousand rubles to show thatthe benefits of trading currencies and narcotics far exceed the 230rubles ($387) a month he earns from his legitimate job.   Organized crime networks fed by smuggled goods flourished in``Mama'' Odessa in the chaos that followed the destruction of theport during Russia's civil war.   Writer Isaac Babel had but to change a few names to pass citylife for fiction. Mobster Benny Krik, the likeable hero of ``TheOdessa Tales,'' was modeled after Odessa's Mishka the Japanese.   But Stalin's terror suppressed the mobs, and 70 years ofsocialism have rebuilt the port, housed the orphans and, morerecently, shut down the obvious dens of iniquity.   Official efforts to tame Odessa's anything-goes spirit havepasted a veneer of respectability over the city. Youth clubs anddance halls now occupy vacated bars and liquor shops.   The authorities launch periodic anti-corruption drives, but asteady influx of contraband has kept the black markets alive, andcleanup campaigns are usually short-lived.   Gypsy fortunetellers cast a wary eye around each club or cafebefore whispering to a patron at the low wooden tables that thesecrets of the future can be had for two rubles ($3.40).   Many of the city's elegant old buildings were closed ordemolished during a building and refurbishing binge, but a glimpseof Odessa's lost grandeur is still visible above the colorlessfacades and cloudy store windows on Deribasovskaya Street.   Three or four stories above metal store signs with unimaginativenames like ``Shoes,'' ``Women's Clothing'' and ``Sundries,''rooftops sport disintegrating cupolas and cornices and leadedwindows from which most of the glass has fallen out.   A renovation plan begun five years ago touched off a campaign topreserve Odessa's landmarks, and in early April, chief architectVasily Mironenko was fired after proposing to cut down the famedchestnut trees along Primorsky Boulevard, overlooking the port.   Many Odessans oppose their city's changing appearance.   A cab driver traveling through the renovated Moldavankaneighborhood contended there is an official plot in the Sovietcapital to force Odessa into the Moscow mold.   ``Odessa is not a phenomenon anymore,'' he said. ``It's just atown.''   The driver was quoting Odessa writer Mikhail Shvanetsky, whosaid the same about the city in the underground literature hecirculated in the 1970s.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Wed May 25 and thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
