Taylor, InformationOfficer (202) 376-4307.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Bureau of the Public Debt has decidedthat it will expand its ongoing efforts to regain contact with investorswith whom it may have lost contact. These are investors whose paymentsor whose correspondence advising of matured but unredeemed securities mayhave been returned to the Bureau. The Bureau has determined that as a wayto regain contact it may undertake a matching program with other federalagencies that offer letter forwarding services. These letter forwardingservices require that the Bureau furnish information on the investors withwhom it has lost contact to the other Federal agency. That Federal agencywould match that information against its data base, which contains addressinformation. If a match is achieved, the Federal agency would send a lettersupplied by the Bureau to the agency's current address of record for thatindividual. Under this service, the Bureau would not receive address informationfrom the other Federal agency. By using such a service, the Bureau wouldbe able to notify investors with whom the Bureau has lost contact that:(1) They should contact the Bureau to obtain these returned payments, or(2) they should redeem their matured securities or contact the Bureau ifthey have lost those securities. Once this routine use is in effect, the Bureau would enter into writtenagreements with these agencies before any disclosures of information aremade. Although these matches are excluded from the coverage of The ComputerMatching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, the Bureau will comply withall other applicable provisions of the Privacy Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Treasury/BPD.002 System Name </ITAG>United States Savings-Type Securities_Treasury/BPD. <ITAG tagnum="85">Routine Uses of Records Maintained in the System, Including Categoriesof Users and the Purposes of Such Uses </ITAG>Description of the change: Remove the ``and'' following the semicolon atthe end of item (14), remove the period at the end of item (15), substitutea semicolon at the end of item 15, and add the following new routine use:<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(16) To disclose through computer matching, information on individuals,with whom the Bureau of the Public Debt has lost contact, to other Federalagencies for the purpose of utilizing letter forwarding services to advisethese individuals that they should contact the Bureau about returned paymentsand/or matured unredeemed securities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Treasury/BPD.003 System Name </ITAG>United States Securities (Other than Savings-Type Securities)_Treasury/BPD.<ITAG tagnum="85">Routine Uses of Records Maintained in the System, Including Categoriesof Users and the Purposes of Such Uses </ITAG>Description of the change: Remove the ``and'' following the semicolon atthe end of item (14), remove the period at the end of item (15), substitutea semicolon at the end of item 15, and add the following new routine use:<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(16) To disclose through computer matching, information on individuals,with whom the Bureau of the Public Debt has lost contact, to other Federalagencies for the purpose of utilizing their letter forwarding servicesto advise these individuals that they should contact the Bureau about returnedpayments and/or matured unredeemed securities.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David M.
