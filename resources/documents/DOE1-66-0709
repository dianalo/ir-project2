Constitution: In a controlrod, a tie rod of a cross-like cross section passing axially is disposedat the center and upper and lower support plates are attached at theupper and lower ends of the tie rod respectively. Cross-like controlrod sheaths radially secured to the tie rod and supported to the supportplates are axially divided into substantially equal four portions toconstitute for regions. Then, the region next to the top where neutronirradiation dose is high is constituted with long life neutron absorberrods formed with hafnium. Thus, the nuclear reactor is operated onlywith deeply inserted control rods and, in a case where the neutron radiationdose is increased at the second region from the top among the axiallydivided equal four portions of the control rod, since the reactivitydegradation rate in this region is slow, sufficient effect can be expectedfor increasing the life time.
