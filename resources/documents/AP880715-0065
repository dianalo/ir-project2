(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Public interest in the Earth's troubledclimate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed toend the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during adrought symposium here.   ``Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria,'' said PatMichaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of thesymposium.   He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 droughtin many places, has drawn much attention because some of theaffected areas include large media centers.   ``I'm worried ... that when the next drought happens, we aregoing to have to rediscover the climate problem,'' said Michaels,president of the Association of State Climatologists.   Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect _ the warmingof the Earth's atmosphere _ has brought needed attention to changesin the global climate, even though it is not directly related tothe drought.   Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposiumagreed that the Earth's temperature is warming, but they debatedwhether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact onEarth.   However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program inWashington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers shouldbegin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertakingpolicies that ``make sense in their own right.''   Mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels, he said, bybecoming more energy efficient, replanting forests andinvestigating alternative energy supplies.   Scientists have warned in recent years that Earth's atmosphereis gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat andcause the overall temperature to rise. Besides fossil fuels, thedepletion of forests in South America has been blamed for theincrease of carbon dioxide and methane.   Some have warned that higher temperature will change thecharacter of many countries, for example drying out the U.S.Midwest or melting polar ice caps.   The symposium was sponsored by The Weather Channel, anAtlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live.   Earlier Thursday, the climatologists were told the movement ofplanets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in theSoutheast.   ``There is some evidence that as Jupiter goes around the sun atits fastest point, there are drought conditions in the Southeast inthe months of April and October,'' Georgia state climatologistGayther Plummer said.   However, David Rodenhuis, director of the federal ClimateAnalysis Center in Washington, said he was skeptical of Plummer'sthesis.   ``There's an enormous number of possibilities that one couldchase,'' Rodenhuis said. ``The next business of the scientist is to... extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect.''</TEXT></DOC>
