The promise appeared to persuade some lawmakers to support the pending free-trade agreement. &quot;I believe these steps greatly increase the prospect that the negotiations (between Congress and the administration over the pact) will succeed,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), who had led a serious challenge to congressional approval of the trade pact. &quot;They give this agreement sharper teeth.&quot;    Several Western senators have contended that the pact would be unfair to their region's natural-resource industries. They complained that the accord would reduce U.S. tariffs on many Canadian natural-resources products without forcing Canada to eliminate subsidies on such goods that it ships to this country.    U.S. industries that wanted the administration to crack down on subsidized Canadian products include those producing nonferrous metals, coal, plywood, uranium and wheat.    The administration's commitment came as officials worked with the Senate Finance Committee to craft legislation that would be introduced in June to implement the U.S.-Canada trade agreement. The accord won't be submitted as a treaty, which would require approval by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. Instead, both House and Senate will vote on legislation implementing the pact. But under special &quot;fast-track&quot; rules, the bill will require only majority approval and must be voted on, without amendments, within 90 legislative days of its submission.    The plan devised yesterday would set up new monitoring procedures that would make it more likely that the U.S. would act against subsidized Canadian goods.    The plan also would state that the U.S.-Canada agreement would be terminated if progress isn't made in negotiations to end Canadian subsidies after seven years. The president wouldn't have to end the pact if it were in the national economic interest of the U.S. to continue it, though.    The administration also agreed not to lower tariffs on plywood entering the U.S. from Canada until Ottawa changes domestic plywood standards that effectively shut out U.S. manufacturers. The trade accord calls for plywood tariffs to be phased out, but U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a letter to Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), that the administration won't allow the phase-out to begin until Canada opens its market to U.S. plywood.    The administration's efforts to smooth out problems on the U.S.-Canada pact increase the chances that Congress will approve the accord. Some congressional Democrats had warned that approval of the pact might be threatened by President Reagan's promised veto of the separate, big trade bill. But, in addition to the progress at the Senate Finance Committee on the pact, a House Ways and Means trade subcommittee last week approved the administration's proposal without any significant changes. </TEXT></DOC>
