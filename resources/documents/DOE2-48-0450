Because of the highproportion of nonvolatile compounds in heavy oils, gas chromatography(GC) is not particularly useful for characterization purposes. High performanceliquid chromatography, while capable of analyzing a larger proportionof the nonvolatiles, possesses considerably less resolution than GC.By utilizing mobile phases in their supercritical region it is possibleto study compounds that cannot be vaporized for GC analysis, yet stillattain the resolution approaching that of GC. Another advantage of supercriticalfluid chromatography (SFC) with the commonly used mobile phase CO/sub2/, is the ability to employ the flame ionization detector (FID) whichprovides a uniform response over a wide range of compound types. SFCmethods used on packed columns are excellent for low resolution separationsinto hydrocarbon group types and can produce data in about 5 to 15 min.A number of workers have described the use of packed silica columns forthe separation and quantitation of saturate and aromatic component typesin gasolines and middle distillate fuels, and of saturates, aromaticsand polars in high boiling residues. In these studies the mobile phasewas CO/sub 2/ and the detector was the FID. Campbell and Lee reporteda semi-preparative SFC method using a packed, amino-modified silica columnfor the separation of aromatics according to the number of rings in acoal tar and a solved refined coal heavy distillate.</TEXT></DOC>
