Customers can get two-way digital overseas transmission of any combination of data, voice and video on a single communications circuit. Currently, the service is available only from west to east; within a few days, when the San Francisco station goes into operation, it will be available in both directions.    An ITT spokesman said the service isn't unique, but it's the first time it has been offered by the company. The company began taking a few customers for the service about three months ago. </TEXT></DOC>
