Davis.andO;Rappaport argued that the next era of semiconductor technologywill be governed by the concept of 'building what can bedesigned,' driven in large part by major drops in the cost of thesilicon technology as devices become ever more dense.andP;  Thecomplement will be ever higher semiconductor design costs asdevices incorporate millions of transistors.andP;  Davis believes thattelecommunications will keep the semiconductor industries verybusy, as the transmission capacity of telephone and computer linesrises dramatically.andP;  This growth in broadband capacity will bedriven by the installation of fiber optic lines that will firstprovide telephone services, to be followed by digital services.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Semiconductor IndustryOutlookIntegrated CircuitsSystem DevelopmentPerformance-Cost RelationshipOptical CommunicationsFiber OpticsTelephone SystemsForecasting.andO;Feature:   illustrationportrait.andO;Caption:   Edward M.
