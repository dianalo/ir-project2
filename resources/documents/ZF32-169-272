(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Caber Software's COM-AND is a shareware package with many features found inits more expensive commercial competitors, but it does have limitations.andP;  Inits favor are a sophisticated script language, support for a mouse, and a low$35 registration fee.andP;  COM-AND also offers some welcome extras such asaccessory programs for group chatting, for speech synthesis, and even forplaying bridge and chess.andM;You can find COM-AND on many popular BBSs, such as Flashbacker in Alabama,and in library 3 of CompuServe's IBMCOM forum.andP;  It's generally available in aseries of compressed files.andP;  The version we tested, Version 2.7, totals about753K among the four files CA27-1 .ARC through CA27-4.ARC.andM;COM-AND senses a first-time execution and asks a few hardware configurationquestions when you install it.andP;  One weak link is that you can choose only alimited number of modem types from built-in scripts containing initializationstrings: Microcom 9624c, Everex 2400 internal, Leading Edge 2400B half-sizeinternal, Practical Peripherals 2400 half-size internal, Everex Evercom 24Plus (MNP), and Hayes-compatible.andP;  This last one has wide application, butthe generic approach is not as effective as the lists of specific modems thatother companies offer.andP;  You can create specific modem setup strings later.andM;In addition to ZModem, built-in file-transfer protocols include CompuServe B,CompuServe Quick-B, Kermit, XModem (checksum and CRC), XModem IK, andYModem-G.andP;  COM-AND can also shell out to DOS to run external protocols.andP;  Theprogram requires 252K RAM, so you should have adequate memory available.andP;  Youcan set the program to a maximum port rate of 115,200 bits per second.andM;You can run COM-AND from its pull-down menu system or through itsfunction-key and Alt-letter-key sequences.andP;  Help is not context-sensitive,but you can call up a full-screen help display at any time during yourCOM-AND session by pressing F10.andP;  POWERFUL SCRIPTING COM-AND supports RLE(run length encoded) graphics.andP;  The program comes with built-in ANSI,CompuServe Vidtex, DEC VT52 and VT100, and TTY terminal emulation modes.andP;  Thekeyboard-remapping function lets you redefine your keystrokes to emulate aterminal keyboard.andM;The program's power flows in large part from its scripting language.andP;  Itcomes with script s for controlling a wide array of functions.andP;  You can makeCOM-AND act as a dial-in host or a full Kermit server.andP;  It can offer a filemanager shell or enable PC-to-PC transfers.andP;  Scripts are available to makethe program learn your keystrokes, load external protocols, chain-dial aseries of numbers, run an on-line game, or perform a screen dump to aconnected printer.andP;  One script sets your PC's system time by calling theNaval Observatory, while another sets an alarm time.andP;  The script languagealso makes mouse functions available.andM;COM-AND generally works well; in our experience, its CompuServe script forautomated log-ons worked flawlessly.andP;  The learning script, however, is notperfect.andP;  When you run it, it should record your keystrokes and build anotherscript from your actions.andP;  But after we tried to make the program learn howto access a local BBS, for example, the reconnect attempt was unsuccessful.andO;The manual points out that you may have to edit a script after compiling itwith the learning script.andM;COM-AND also includes a script to enable the speech synthesis program.andP;  Thisprogram uses a speech driver that translates text to phonemes, which yourPC's speaker then reproduces in sounds.andP;  It won't prove useful to manypeople, though, as it works only on 4.77-MHz PCs; anything faster makes thespeech sound like Minnie Mouse.andP;  FLOW CONTROL PROBLEMS In our performancetests, COM-AND had a significant problem handling a file transfer whenhardware RTS/CTS (Request to Send/Clear to Send) flow control wasimplemented; the program failed at the three port speeds used during testing.andO;With RTS/CTS turned off, it was one of the fastest file-transfer programs.andO;Nevertheless, the ability to use RTS/CTS flow control is necessary to makethe most efficient connections to high-speed modems; COM-AND's inability tohandle this is a significant limitation.andM;If you don't wish to download COMAND, SupportWare distributes the program onfloppy disks for Caber Software.andP;  You can order the current version bysending $5 for three 5.25-inch or $10 for two 3.5-inch disks.andP;  If you decideto use the program, you pay the $35 registration fee and get free technicalsupport from SupportWare, 10:00 A.M.andP;  to 10:00 P.M.andP;  (P.S.T.) seven days aweek.andM;COM-AND is a communications package with strong script facilities (althoughyou may have to edit those built from a learn script) along with anattractive price.andP;  Its biggest limitation-the one that may keep some usersaway-is its inability to use RTS/CTS flow control.andP;  ASYNCHRONOUSCOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE: SUMMARY OF FEATURES Products listed in ascendingprice order Amount of disk space used Communications software enables atraveling user to connect with the home off ice when on the road.andP;  Knowinghow much disk space a program requires to run can be helpful to users of somelaptop machines, particularly those that don't include hard disks.andP;  Networksupport Many organizations are installing asynchronous communications serverson networks so that people can share a pool of modems.andP;  Communicationssoftware that can use such pooled modems must be able to address specificinterfaces such as interrupt 14h (INT14), NetBIOS, or Novell's NASI.andP;  Youusually need only one type of network support for any single installation.andO;Number of comm ports on the menu In their standard configurations, PCstypically come with two serial ports; in practice, internal modems and I/Oadapters with multiple asynchronous ports often occupy COM3 or COM4locations.andP;  in some cases, they go beyond that, accommodating eight ports ormore.andP;  Remember that even if the product's menu supports only four ports, itis possible to change the IRO and memory address to redefine any of thosefour ports as COM5 or higher.andP;  The ability to control the speed of portsusing the RS-232C data terminal equipment (DTE) line is important for orderlytransmission.andP;  Hayes ESP support The Hayes ESP board includes two serialports for simultaneously sending and receiving data.andP;  The board'sfeatures-including an intel 8031 coprocessor, 1 K of buffer memory, andHayes' Enhanced Serial Interface (ESI)-allow incoming data to be sentdirectly to a PC's memory, taking the processing burden off the computer'sCPU and increasing allowable throughput.andP;  Number of predefined setup stringsA modem setup string contains the information needed to initialize a specificmake and model of modem.andP;  Some setup strings can initialize several types ofmodems, but generally the more setup strings available in a product, thebetter its ability to work in many different installations.andP;  User-definablesetup strings The ability to produce and save user-defined modem setupstrings lets you use a modem that may not be specifically listed in theprogram's list of predefined setup strings.andP;  Protocols on menu IND$FILE is atext-editing program with some file-transfer capabilities that runs on IBMmainframe computers.andM;Special flavors of the Kermit and XModem protocols  (sliding windows and ACKahead, respectively) include the ability to accept late acknowledgements in asliding window of time; this is particularly useful for communicationssystems such as a satellite link with a long delay.andP;  Proprietary protocolsare included with some programs.andP;  These are generally unique to the program,but companies like Hilgraeve make their proprietary protocols available toother programs as external protocols.andP;  User-installed external protocolsrefers to a program's ability to read in program modules containing code forspecific file-transfer protocols.andP;  A scripting language provides a programwith the ability to automate functions.andP;  Languages with a large number ofverbs (or commands) are generally more powerful and flexible than those withfewer verbs.andP;  An autolearn function allows a program to monitor an on-lineexchange of data and create a script to automate the functions of the callingdevice.andP;  The ability to control synchronous communications exchanges (likethose used with X.25 networks and mainframe connections) through theprogramming language is often important to people in organizations withsophisticated communications needs.andP;  Canned communications scripts make iteasier for users to configure their software and hardware for services suchas MCI Mail and CompuServe.andP;  Products like Telix and Smartcom Exec do notcome with these scripts built-in.andP;  Yet you can easily download scripts forTelix from the bulletin board where you obtained the communications program;likewise, you can download scripts for Smartcom Exec from the Hayes BBS.andO;Terminal emulation modes on menu The ability to emulate many terminals-ANSI,CompuServe Vidtex, DEC VT220, IBM 31 01, and TTY are among the mostimportant-can be useful to people in a multivendor computing environment.andM;The popularity of DEC minicomputers makes the ability to emulate DEC VT220terminals particularly important to many users.andP;  if the product supportsspecial printing modes such as transparent terminal printing and auto-print(which are methods of printing from the DEC host to a terminal or PCemulating a terminal), it probably has a reasonably complete emulator.andM;The TTY mode is commonly called a glass Teletype&quot; because it printscharacters on the screen without special formatting, much like an oldTeletype machine.andP;  Host operations Many programs can operate as a host forcallers, with capabilities that include mini-BBS features (simple electronicbulletin board functions) and full remote access to run applications.andO;Various security levels, including a sysop level (special rights for thesystem operator), add data protection.andP;  The phone directory provides a listof the services available for calling and makes for fast selection.andP;  Callbackfeature refers to the program's ability to call a number again if it was busythe first time.andP;  Password security for local use This feature lets theprogram prevent other people from gaining access to the keyboard and usingon-line services.andP;  A scroll-back buffer allows you to review the exchange ofdata over the communications line without interrupting the on-line session.andO;The amount of data available for review depends on the size of the buffer,which is usually adjustable from within the program.andP;  Can transmit blocksfrom buffer If you can transmit data from within the scroll-back buffer, youcan repeat detailed commands or addresses and quote back lines of textwithout using an external program.andP;  Built-in text editor Many of theseprograms not only allow you to use your own text editor, but they includetheir own built-in text editor.andP;  Important functions for a program's texteditor to include are the ability to search, perform a search-and-replace,and edit multiple files simultaneously.andP;  Programs that let you see themessage you are answering add a particularly welcome touch.andP;  File managementSome programs include file management capabilities that allow you tomanipulate the files on a local or networked drive without leaving theprogram.andP;  Some even offer a DOS shell to let you control files from withinthe program.andM;Some of the Windows-based programs do not include additional features liketext editors or file management capabilities.andP;  Note that even when theprogram lacks these features, the Windows environment can provide them.andP;  Flowcontrol You must select a flow control parameter to let the modem andcomputer know when to send more data to fill the modem's buffer.andP;  The flowcontrol is necessary to make sure that data is not lost due to data overrun.andO;When the modem's buffer gets close to full, it needs to warn the computer.andM;The hardware flow control method uses two wires, RTS/CTS (Request toSend/Clear to Send), which the modem and the PC can alternately raise andlower to tell each other when they are ready to send and receive data.andO;Software flow control sends these signals using two data characters,XON/XOFF, but this takes more time, and the software needs to distinguishXON/XOFF from the other data.andP;  RTS/CTS is the more popular flow controlsetting, although you must ensure that your serial cabling supports it.andM;All of the programs we reviewed offer both hardware and software flowcontrol, which is why this information does not appear in the table.andP;  FACTFILE COM-AND, Version 2.7 Caber Software, distributed by SupportWare, P.O.andO;Box 14927, Long Beach, CA 908031449; 213-439-6104.andP;  List Price: $35registration fee.andP;  Requires: 252K RAM, DOS 2.0 or later.andP;  in Short: COM-AND,a shareware general-purpose communications program, uses a strong scriptlanguage to provide much of the versatility you would expect of a commercialproduct.andP;  Its biggest drawback is that with RTS/ CTS flow control enabled, itcould not transfer files at any speed during our testing.andP;
