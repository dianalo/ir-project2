Zhao, speaking Wednesday with delegates to the current sessionof the National People's Congress, China's legislature, said Chinashould learn from developed countries, where nutritionists arediscouraging excess consumption of meat.   Zhao's comments, carried Thursday by the official Xinhua NewsAgency, follow several articles in the official media warning thatthe rapid increase in meat consumption can't continue amidstagnating grain production.   Since 1983, consumption of meat, poultry, eggs and fish hasrisen 10 percent annually while agricultural production has gone uponly 2 percent or 3 percent a year.   Last year, most large Chinese cities for the first time indecades began rationing pork, China's favorite meat, becausefarmers strapped by rising feed costs and low government prices forpigs were not meeting the rising demand for pork.   Zhao backed up a statement by acting Premier Li Peng, who in hisreport at the opening of the congress last week said that ``for arelatively long time, because of the restrictions imposed by theamount of grain held per capita, a major increase in supplies ofmeat, poultry, eggs and other animal food products will not bepossible.''   Zhao said the government should guide the eating habits of thenation just as it has held down population growth with its onechild policy.   ``Since we've made world-acknowledged achievements in familyplanning, why can't we guide the people in their food pattern?'' hesaid.   Zhao suggested that higher prices for pork could be used toguide people to eat more chicken and rabbit than pork.   China's grain production hit a record 407 million tons in 1984but has failed to equal that since then. In the same period, grainconsumption, largely because of increased demand for meat products,has increased by 15 million tons annually.   The government must attain its optimistic goal of increasinggrain production to 500 million tons by the year 2000 just to keepper-capita levels at the current 880 pounds because of populationgrowth.   Last year, the average Chinese ate a little more than 37 poundsof meat, including about 31 pounds of pork. The average American in1984 consumed 143{ pounds of meat.</TEXT></DOC>
