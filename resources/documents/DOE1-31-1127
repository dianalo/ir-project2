The conclusions are as following: Though the flux-limitedproblem in neutron diffusion theory are theoretically solved by derivedflux-limited diffusion equation, it's going too far to limit flux dueto the inappropriate assumption in deriving flux-limited diffusion equation.The asymptotic diffusion theory with time absorption constant has eliminatedthe above-mentioned limitation, and it is more accurate than flux-limiteddiffusion theory in describing neutron transport problem.</TEXT></DOC>
