The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons _ includingthe popular Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine _followed a four-month study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the GunControl Act of 1968, which barred importation of weapons that arenot used for legitimate sporting purposes.   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase inthe number of these weapons being imported and police reports oftheir use in violent crime,'' said Stephen E. Higgins, director ofthe ATF bureau.   While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose importshad been suspended since early spring will be available for importagain as a result of the study. Those include six .22 rimfirecaliber rifles and a gun called the Valmet Hunter, which had beenconsidered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp on Friday blamed hisReagan administration predecessor, Samuel Pierce, for a burgeoningagency scandal and hinted he might suspend additional programs aspart of a cleansing effort.   Kemp made his comments as the White House said a budget aideunder congressional scrutiny has been ordered to avoid any HUDmatters under investigation. Janet Hale, a specialist at the Officeof Management and Budget, spent five years at the Department ofHousing and Urban Development and approved agency financing of aproject involving a longtime friend of Pierce.   Kemp's comments were his most direct to date in appraising thedifficulties he inherited when he became housing secretary earlierthis year.   ``I'm making a lot of changes, so that, by definition, issuggesting that Secretary Pierce unfortunately _ a very decent andhonest man _ did not in my view manage HUD as carefully or closelyas it should have been managed,'' he told reporters after speakingto a Republican group.   ``That reflects on Mr. Pierce and, I say this with sadness notanger, it reflects on the Reagan administration,'' Kemp said. He andPresident Bush will be to blame, Kemp said, if they are unsuccessfulin reforming the agency, a huge task that now involves majorinternal reviews of virtually all of the agency's major programs.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush asked Congress Friday to give7,900 federal executives pay raises of 8 percent to 25 percent, butsaid the officials should prove their worth every three years orforfeit the increase.   Bush also proposed a ban on congressional honoraria, such asoutside speaking fees, after 18 months to open the way for a payhike for members of Congress. He stopped short of actually proposinga salary increase for them but promised in a letter to House andSenate leaders to ``work with Congress toward this end.''   ``He told the Congress early on that he would be supportive of acongressional pay raise, but that's a matter he would like to workout with them. They are of the same attitude,'' said presidentialpress secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Bush earlier this year gave his support to a proposed 51 percentpay raise for members of Congress endorsed by the Reaganadministration, but the plan was rejected in Congress after a publicoutcry arose.</TEXT></DOC>
