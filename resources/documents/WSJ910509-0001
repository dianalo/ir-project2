In testimony yesterday before the Senate BankingCommittee, Mr. Volcker said that stripping the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. of its power to protect all thedepositors of large failed banks &quot;could well trigger a crisisin the banking system of a magnitude entirely capable ofturning serious recession into something much worse.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The too-big-to-fail doctrine, the idea that some banks aretoo big to fail because their collapse could shake confidencein the financial system, is one of the most sensitive issuesin the current debate over rewriting the banking laws. Inthese cases, such as the recent failure of Bank of NewEngland, regulators protect all deposits, even those outsidethe formal limits of federal deposit insurance.   This week, a House Banking Committee panel voted to endthe too-big-to-fail option, starting in 1995. The Senate isexpected to consider a similar proposal next month. But Mr.Volcker said that in a banking system where &quot;trillions ofdollars of payments are being made each day,&quot; it is importantfor regulators to have the authority to prevent the problemfrom spinning out of control by protecting depositors fromloss if necessary.   Mr. Volcker, who is chairman of the investment bankingfirm of James D. Wolfensohn Inc. and a professor at PrincetonUniversity, supported the Bush administration's plan totighten bank regulation and allow banks to operate nationwideand to affiliate with securities firms. But he stronglyopposed the administration's proposal to allow commercialcompanies to own banks.</TEXT></DOC>
