Says Second-Quarter Profit   Was Flat or Up a Bit on 8% Sales Drop   ----   By Suzanne Alexander   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   LDL</CO><IN>DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)</IN><LP>   MANCHESTER, Conn. -- Lydall Inc., citing a generalslowdown in the economy, said its second-quarter net incomewas flat to slightly higher on a sales decline of about 8%from the year-ago period.   The maker of fiber-based industrial products expects toreport net income of $2.2 million to $2.3 million, or 76 to79 cents a share, on sales of about $32 million, LeonardJaskol, president and chief executive officer, said in aninterview. Analysts were expecting net income of 80 cents ashare, the company said.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-ago quarter, Lydall earned $2.2 million, or 75cents a share, on sales of $34.9 million.   Mr. Jaskol asserted that sales have slowed because of thephasing out of several product lines and because some marketsaren't as &quot;vibrant&quot; as last year, although he said thecompany isn't losing market share.   Lydall still expects earnings for all of 1990 to grow 11%to about $3 a share from $7.9 million, or $2.70 a share, in1989. Sales will be about the same as last year's $128.4million.   Mr. Jaskol noted that in the past year, Lydall has phasedout three product lines in its Manning non-wovens division.The products, inherited when Lydall acquired Manning PaperCo. in 1986, didn't fit with Lydall's technology and weredraining too many resources, the company said. Mr. Jaskolsaid the phase-outs cost the company about $2 million insales for the second quarter.   Lydall's strongest business segments are air and liquidfiltration media -- used in applications such as geneticengineering and medical laboratories -- and thermal barriers-- used in the automotive and refrigeration industries, amongothers.   Lydall's filtration media business, which grew 38% lastyear, is growing at a slower pace this year, in part becauseof a slowdown in sales in South Korea after a record yearlast year.   Mr. Jaskol said Lydall's blood filter media, which filtersout contaminants in blood, is becoming increasingly popularwith hospitals as concern about AIDS and other blood-relateddiseases becomes more acute. Lydall recently agreed inprinciple to become sole supplier of filtering media foroxygenators and cardiotomy filters to a unit of medicalsupplier Baxter Travenol Inc. for at least two years.   Lydall is developing a number of other medical filtermedia, including a blood filter that will filter out whiteblood cells from blood.   Lydall's thermal barriers -- which are used in numerousindustries as shields from intense heat or cold -- are alsoselling at a slower pace this year because of a slowdown inthe auto industry, the company said. The segment grew 52% in1988 and 25% last year. Mr. Jaskol said he sees continuedgrowth this year and in 1991, but to a lesser degree.   The company said it has an agreement with Ford Motor Co.to help solve heat management problems in Ford's products.Mr. Jaskol said Lydall may soon get approval to place a newexterior shield product on some of Ford's noncommercial vansand trucks -- a &quot;significant&quot; move that would boost revenueand possibly persuade other U.S. auto makers to buy theshield as well.   Lydall said it expects to receive a $500,000 grant fromthe New York State Energy Commission to help develop aproduct that provides insulation in refrigerators consideredsuperior to the commonly used chlorofluorocarbon foam. Thisfoam is considered environmentally damaging and may soon bebanned, said Mr. Jaskol.   If the foam is banned, Lydall's thermal barrier could bein widespread use within two years, said Mr. Jaskol. Lydall'sproduct, however, will cost more than the currently usedfoam, Mr. Jaskol added.   Lydall said it is interested in acquiring relatedcompanies, particularly in Europe, where Lydall sees growthpotential. Lydall has begun talking to several companiesalready but hasn't made a decision.</TEXT></DOC>
