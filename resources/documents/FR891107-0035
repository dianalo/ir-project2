This announcement isintended to establish public awareness of a potential eligibility criterionfor access to the Gulf of Mexico reef fish resource. This announcementdoes not prevent any other date for eligibility in the fishery or anothermethod of controlling fishing effort from being proposed and implemented.The intended effect of this announcement is to discourage new entry tothe fishery based on speculation while discussions continue on whetherand how access to the reef fish resource should be controlled.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>William Turner, NMFS, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico(FMP) was developed in 1981 and is currently being amended by the Gulfof Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). Amendment 1 was approvedby the Council on July 13, 1989.This notice is not part of the proposed Amendment 1. However, the Councilhas been requested by its industry advisory panel (AP) to develop alternativelimited access systems for review by the industry by 1992. The fisherycurrently has more participants than are necessary to harvest the optimumyield (OY). Since the current fishing fleet is capable of harvesting theentire reef fish OY, additional fishing effort would lead to harvestinginefficiencies, more management constraints, and increased conservationrisks. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has concurred thatthe Council begin to address this problem by developing additional controlson fishing effort. Such controls contemplated by the Council may includethose that control access to the reef fish fishery.To assist the Council, the Assistant Administrator has agreed to publisha notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing that anyone entering the reef fishfishery after November 1, 1989, will not be assured of future participationshould the Council develop, and the Secretary of Commerce implement, aneffort control regime that limits the number of participants in the fishery.At its meeting of September 11-14, 1989, the Council voted to recommendthis notice and adopted November 1, 1989, as the control date.NMFS and the Council intend, in making this announcement, to discouragespeculative entry into the reef fishery while potential entry or accesscontrol management regimes are discussed by the Council and possibly developed.If the Council decides to develop an access or entry control managementregime, some fishermen who do not currently fish for reef fish in the Gulfof Mexico and have never done so may decide to enter the fishery for thesole purpose of establishing a record of making commercial landings ofreef fish.Such a record generally is considered indicative of economic dependenceon the fishery. On this basis, the fishermen may successfully lay claimto access to a fishery that is otherwise limited to traditional participants.New entrants may have to buy the fishing rights or a permit from an existingparticipant. Hence, initial access to the fishery at little or no costmay result in a windall gain when selling an access right to a new entrant.This speculation often is responsible for a rapid increase in fishing effortin fisheries already fully or over-developed when management authoritiesbegin to consider use of a limited access management regime. The originalproblems become exacerbated by those who seek possible windfall gain fromthe solutions being discussed. To help distinguish bona fide, establishedreef fish fishermen from speculative entrants to the fishery, a managementauthority may set a control date before discussions and planning of controlledaccess regimes begin. Fishermen are notified that entering the fisheryafter that date will not necessarily assure them of future access to thefishery resource on grounds of previous participation. Other qualifyingcriteria, such as holding a permit before the control date and documentationof commercial landings and sales, may be applied for entry.This announcement establishes November 1, 1989, as a control date for potentialuse in determining historical or traditional participation in the Gulfof Mexico reef fish fishery. This action does not commit the Council orSecretary to any particular management regime or criterion for entry tothe reef fish fishery. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participationin the reef fish fishery regardless of their date of entry or intensityof participation in the reef fish fishery before or after the control date.The Council may choose a different control date, or they may choose a managementregime that does not make use of such a date. The Council may choose togive variably weighted consideration to fishermen in the fishery beforeand after the control date. The Council may choose also to take no furtheraction to control entry or access to the fishery.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority</T4>: 16 U.S.C., 1801 <T3>et seq</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
