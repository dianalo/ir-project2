Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail called the play, adapted fromSteinbeck's Depression-era, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``asshatteringly a perfect piece of American theater as you are likelyto experience in a lifetime of trans-Atlantic travel.''   Claire Armitstead in The Financial Times found the show ``amagnificent ensemble piece ... richly and simply evocative.''   London is the third stop for the play, which bowed in Chicagolast September, before moving last month to the La Jolla Playhousein California. The hope is for it to go to Broadway in the upcomingseason if financing can be found for a New York production with acast of 35.   The 12-performance London engagement at the National's midsizedLyttelton Auditorium was 70 percent sold before it opened. It isexpected to sell out the remainder of the run, through July 1, onthe strength of the reviews.   It is the second Steppenwolf show to be seen in London, followingthe 1986 run of Lyle Kessler's ``Orphans,'' with British actorAlbert Finney.   The three-hour play is more faithful to the book than was JohnFord's 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell as Tom andMa Joad, who lead a community of itinerants westward across the dustbowl to California.   Adapted and directed by Frank Galati, an Oscar nominee this yearfor co-writing ``The Accidental Tourist,'' the play stars GarySinise as Tom and Lois Smith as his mother.   Jeremy Kingston in The Times of London praised Sinise as``intense and sinewy.'' While he pointed to ``a faltering in thesecond half,'' he said ``for the most part Galati's dramatization isconvincingly theatrical.''   Milton Shulman in The Standard said: ``The cast, in spite ofcharacters that are often too sentimental and too one-dimensionalfor credibility, provide ensemble acting of almost balleticprecision.''   Maureen Paton in The Daily Express sounded a notable note ofdissent, writing: ``The cast are about as moving as Mount Rushmore.''   ``It is no wonder Dustin Hoffman was desperate to join a Britishtheater company if this is typical of what the American stage has tooffer,'' she said, referring to the Oscar-winning actor's localappearance, amid a British cast, in Shakespeare's ``The Merchant ofVenice.''   The actors coped well with complex technical demands and theoccasional hitch, which included a fire alarm that rang for fiveminutes during the performance.   Americans arrived in force to cheer on Steppenwolf at theopening, filling about 160 of the Lyttelton's 900 seats.   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' is the second production in theNational's International '89 series, which continues in Septemberwith the Moscow Art Theater performing Anton Chekhov's ``UncleVanya.''</TEXT></DOC>
