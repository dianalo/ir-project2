In 1983, Manville filed a claim asserting that the government had failed to comply with proper safety standards in using asbestos in World War II ship construction. Exposure to asbestos has been linked to lung cancer and other disabling respiratory diseases. Denver-based Manville said the judge ruled that the asbestos maker hadn't proved that the government breached its wartime contracts with the company.    While the amount of the claim, about $1 million paid to 50 asbestos victims, wasn't large, the case is significant because if Manville had succeeded the government could have been exposed to potentially sizable claims by Manville and other asbestos makers.    Robert Willmore, of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said the ruling by Judge Christine Mettesheim &quot;represents the latest loss -- and certainly the most substantial loss to date -- by the asbestos manufacturers in their attempt to force the American taxpayer to subsidize their massive tort liability.&quot;    Robert Batson, Manville's senior legal counsel, said the company was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by the ruling, but was pleased that the court held that the government &quot;was aware of the potential risk to its own shipyard workers and failed to comply with its own standards for safety and industrial hygiene.&quot; Mr. Batson added that Manville would &quot;consider all of its options&quot; in deciding whether to appeal.    Manville filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law in 1982, seeking to deal with a mounting volume of claims tied to asbestos exposure. Under a proposed reorganization plan, Manville has agreed to set up a trust to pay present and future victims of asbestos about $2.5 billion during the next 30 years.    Separately, Manville said its directors approved sale of its corporate headquarters to Martin Marietta Corp.; terms weren't disclosed. Martin Marietta's board previously had approved the purchase. Manville plans to assume the aerospace and defense concern's lease in the Denver Tech Center.    The agreement is subject to bankruptcy-court approval. </TEXT></DOC>
