Some 82 million voters are eligible to choose on Sunday betweenconservative Fernando Collor de Mello and radical leftist LuisInacio Lula da Silva in the second round of Brazil's first freepresidential election since 1960.   The two led a 21-candidate field in the first round Nov. 15, butneither obtained the majority required by law. The winner willsucceed President Jose Sarney for a five-year term starting March15.   Both Collor de Mello and da Silva are young, charismatic leaderswith broad support among Brazil's poor majority. Both started theirpolitical rise during the 1964-1985 right-wing military regime.Both are harsh critics of the Sarney government, which they accuseof being inept and corrupt.   But the two differ sharply on the solutions for Brazil'seconomic and social problems, which include 1,460 percentinflation, widespread poverty and a $110 billion foreign debt, thelargest in the Third World.   Many see the election as a last chance for a peaceful resolutionof Brazil's glaring social and economic inequalities. The WorldBank says, for example, that Brazil's income distribution is themost unequal anywhere.   ``If the new government doesn't solve Brazil's problems, it willface a crisis and collapse in economic and social chaos: foodshortages, looting of supermarkets, paralyzation of publicservices, the middle class attacked by starving masses,'' saidpolitical scientist Helio Jaguaribe. ``Everything indicatesdemocracy will not survive,''   The favorite is Collor de Mello, 40, who founded hiscenter-right National Reconstruction Party just 10 months ago.   The scion of a wealthy political clan in the tiny sugarcane-growing state of Alagoas in the impoverished Northeast, Collorde Mello won tremendous popularity with promises to clean upcorrupt government.   His well-cut suits, aquiline good looks and stinging attacks onSarney captured the imagination of poor voters. He also is backedby right-wing parties, businessmen, big landowners and the powerfulGlobo TV network, Brazil's largest.   His critics say Collor de Mello's record belies his posture as amoralizer. They point out he was a member of the old militaryregime's political party and was accused of payroll padding andfavoring the sugar barons while governor of Alagoas.   ``Collor de Mello has an image as an anti-politician, a managainst the system,'' Jaguaribe said. ``He hides his center-righttendency behind a moralist pose.''   The 44-year-old da Silva, popularly known as Lula, a nickname hehad legalized, is a congressman and former lathe operator who isthe candidate of the radical left Workers Party.   A grade-school dropout, the stocky, bearded da Silva becamenationally known in 1980 when he led a strike against Brazil'sforeign-owned auto industry. He later was sentenced to 3{ years inprison for breaking the National Security Law but wound up servingjust 30 days, as the ruling generals announced a plan for a gradualreturn of civilian liberties.   In 1986, both Collor de Mello and da Silva moved toward nationalrecognition in politics.   Collor de Mello switched to the opposition Brazilian DemocraticMovement Party, was elected governor of Alagoas and made nationalheadlines by firing so-called ``maharajas,'' local civil servantsmaking thousands of dollars a months mostly through politicalconnections.   Da Silva was elected to Congress in 1986 with more votes thanany other candidate. He is supported by leftist labor groups,intellectuals and the dominant liberal wing of Brazil's RomanCatholic Church.   The winner will take on the task of leading a country of 150million people with the Western world's eighth-largest economy, butin which the richest 1 percent owns as much as the poorest 50percent, and half the work force earns the equivalent of $20 a weekor less.   Both candidates say fighting inflation is the No. 1 priority andpromise to court foreign investment. But they diverge sharply onother issues.   Collor de Mello proposes to cut spending and ``privatize'' manystate-run companies. He favors a conventional approach to the $110billion foreign debt but would limit repayments to 2 percent of thegross national product, or about $5 billion a year, about a thirdof what Brazil now pays.   Da Silva promises higher wages, curbs on profits and animmediate moratorium on foreign debt payments. He is against thesale of state companies and spending cuts.   ``To raise salaries, someone has to lose,'' the gravelly voicedcandidate said in a recent televised debate. ``It's impossible tofight inflation without suspending payment of the foreign debt.''   The gap between the candidates has polarized the election into abattle of left vs. right, rich vs. poor, socialism vs. free market.   ``Brazil is in a state of war, and in war you have to takesides. I want to take the side of the poor, whom Lula represents,''Bishop Mauro Morelli of Duque de Caxias, an impoverished city nearRio de Janeiro, said in an interview.   Collor de Mello has played on the elite's fear of a da Silvagovernment. He warned of a ``blood bath'' if the leftist wins.   ``Lula's radical ideas mean strikes and chaos,'' says onecampaign advertisement for Collor de Mello. ``Foreign investmentwill leave Brazil. Lula is a step backward for Brazil.''   Mario Amato, president of the influential Federation ofIndustries of the State of Sao Paulo predicted that ``800,000businessmen will flee the country'' if da Silva is elected.   Da Silva's campaign ads counter that Collor de Mello is a``creation of the dictatorship'' and advise viewers, ``Don't put afox in charge of the henhouse.''   ``Lula is virtually the only national leader who can say, `I amfrom the people. I look like the people.' He has realcredibility,'' Alfred Stepan, professor of political science anddean of the School of International and Public Affairs at ColumbiaUniversity in New York, said in an interview in Sao Paulo, where heattended a recent seminar.   While the campaign has stirred passions among voters _ 73percent of whom never cast a ballot for president _ the campaignhas been remarkably peaceful.   ``For a country to come out of 21 years of military rule withthe worst income distribution in the world and have the majority ofthe people committed to democratic change is extraordinary,''Stepan said.   The last elected president was Janio Quadros in 1960. Heabruptly resigned after seven months in office claiming an``oligarchy'' sought to disrupt his presidency. The ensuingconfusion led to an armed forces coup in 1964. Sarney, a civilian,was chosen in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by themilitary government.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 17</NOTE></DOC>
