<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-0118 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since minimal data are available regarding the pulmonary effects of ozone(O{sub 3}) in healthy individuals over the age of 55, this research wasdesigned to determine if this group was at risk for pulmonary functionchanges when exposed to O{sub 3} at ambient concentrations for one hourduring intermittent exercise. Ten female and nine male subjects wereexposed for 60 minutes in random order to one of the following O{sub3} concentrations: 0.0, 0.2, or 0.3 ppm. All exposures were administeredthrough a rubber mouthpiece while the subject was either at rest or moderatelyexercising on a treadmill. The following pulmonary function tests (PFT)were recorded before exposure, and at periods immediately following and20 minutes post-exposure: total respiratory resistance (R/sub T/), thoracicgas volume at functional residual capacity (FRC), and forced expiratoryvolume in one second (FEV{sub 1}). Baseline PFT mean values and air exposurePFT mean values were compared through the use of repeated measure two-wayanalysis of variance to detect any significant effect of exposure onthese parameters. Following 60 minute of exposure at light intermittentexercise, there were no statistically significant pulmonary functionalchanges observed in male subjects. However, in female subjects, a statisticallysignificant increase in R/sub T/ was observed.</TEXT></DOC>
