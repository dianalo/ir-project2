Bush began weighing his options after the reported hanging ofMarine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a member of the United Nationspeacekeeping force, by his Lebanese kidnappers, even as theterrorists threatened other murders.   Our president made an urgent call for all parties holdinghostages in the Middle East to release them immediately, ``to beginto reverse the cycle of violence in that region.'' ...   In Bush's policy crisis over the new terroristic activities, heconfronts the same problems his two presidential predecessorsencountered in relation to Middle East atrocities: An enemy inlarge part unseen, splintered into many religious factions withmany different names, embracing a culture in which these splintergroups play by rules with which we are not familiar. ...   It would be easy to invoke a knee-jerk reaction of an eye for aneye in relation to the activities of terrorists, but that kind ofretaliation is not effective against such a mysterious enemy. Adiffused target is difficult to hit.   Because each situation of Middle East terrorism is unique, it isdifficult for this nation to establish one national policy to coverall.   The no-negotiation policy, however, must be retained.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 3   North Jersey Herald and News, Passaic, N.J., on terrorism:   It's time to admit it: The West just doesn't have a handle onhow to deal with savage Mideast terrorists.   Threats against the American hostages in the Middle East make itimportant to recognize a few basic facts:   _ Anger over the execution should be directed straight at thepro-Iranian group that says it acted in retaliation for an Israelicommando raid and capture of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   _ The Bush Administration must consider a more active militaryrole in protecting Americans who are held hostage.   _ An international effort must be made to pressure Mideastgovernments into discouraging terrorist acts.   A decade of watching in horror and lame condemnations has notmade the world a safer place. Honorable world leaders must nowstand together _ boldly _ to hold terrorists accountable for theirgrisly deeds.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 2   The Commercial Review, Portland, Ind., on terrorism:   If George Bush isn't careful, he's going to fall into the sametrap which ensnared Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. ...   The president has come dangerously close to becoming a hostageto the hostage situation in the Middle East.   That's what happened to Jimmy Carter, distorting his presidencyand sending him packing for Georgia. And that's what happened toRonald Reagan in his second term, resulting in the legal abuses andpolicy disasters of the Iran-Contra affair.   It could happen again. ... Unless President Bush and hisadvisers handle the situation adroitly, they could find themselvesdoing nothing more than reacting to an agenda set by a group ofterrorists in Beirut. ...   What the president must do, instead, is make clear Americanoutrage over the murder of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and thedeath threats made against other hostages, make clear that theUnited States will not deal with barbarians and criminals, and keephis mouth shut about when or where or in what form retribution willcome. ...   A patient, steady course is the right one, a course determinedby American interests and a firm resolve to see justice done.   The alternative is to let a band of criminals in Lebanonindirectly seize control of this country's foreign policy.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
