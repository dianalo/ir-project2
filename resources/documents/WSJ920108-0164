Meanwhile, rival Boeing Co. is also stepping up pressure.In a recent letter sent to senior White House officials,Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz said he feared that because offunding by the Taiwan government, &quot;we could thus end up withanother highly subsidized competitor in this business.&quot; Headded that while &quot;we are not trying to stop the McDonnellDouglas-Taiwan initiative,&quot; Boeing wants to make sure &quot;itgoes forward . . . on a sound commercial basis.&quot; TaiwanAerospace is 29%-owned by the Taipei government.</LP><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas executives have countered that anyinvestment by Taiwan Aerospace -- no matter who its backers-- will be subject to free-market forces. &quot;This is aneconomic investment, subject to the disciplines of themarket,&quot; Chairman John McDonnell maintained in November, whenthe St. Louis aerospace concern and Taiwan Aerospace signed amemorandum of understanding. Even if there is substantialmoney provided by the Taipei government, he said, &quot;they'reexpecting a good return on their investment.&quot;   But that very notion of investment is alarming some in theTaiwan legislature, who argue that the government mustproceed cautiously with its spending plans. TaiwanAerospace's direct investment in McDonnell Douglas couldtotal as much as $2 billion, and may be only the first stepin a huge investment program that could exceed $5 billion.   Some Taiwan legislators are also raising questions aboutthe feasibility of trying to build the vast infrastructureneeded for a commercial-aircraft industry in a country wherenone now exists.   Separately, McDonnell Douglas said yesterday that it won'tmake the Jan. 31 timetable for reaching a definitiveagreement. Many observers had felt that deadline was tooambitious. Officials in Taiwan suggested that theirevaluation team's report could be completed in March.   With the possibility of a major government expenditurelooming, ruling-party and opposition legislators in Taiwanare noisily staking a claim to budget decisions. Indisplaying unprecedented assertiveness and demanding adecision-making role, they could hold the power to delay oreven scuttle a transaction that requires government spending.   Taiwan Aerospace's top executives have been out of thecountry since late December and haven't responded to requestsfor interviews. But the company's president, Denny Ko, hasstated on several occasions that the acquisition of the stakein McDonnell Douglas isn't assured.   Other camps in the U.S. are also stepping up theiropposition to the deal. Earlier this week, labor leaders inCalifornia, worried about jobs lost to factories abroad,formed a committee with the stated goal of delayinggovernment approval of the transaction. While U.S. regulatorsaren't expected to block the deal, Rep. Barbara Boxer (D.,Calif.) said yesterday that she would meet with unionrepresentatives to explore the jobs issue.   For their part, McDonnell Douglas officials expressed hopetheir talks with Taiwan Aerospace will proceedsatisfactorily. But if the deal falls through, there areother potential equity partners in the wings. &quot;We feel Taiwancould present the ideal partner,&quot; said Herbert Lanese,McDonnell Douglas's chief financial officer. &quot;However, it'snot the only game in town.&quot;   Under the terms of their tentative agreement, McDonnellDouglas and Taiwan Aerospace are seeking to set up ajoint-venture company that would manufacture a new passengerjet, the MD-12, with substantial portions of the plane slatedto be produced in Taiwan. Once this arrangement is in place,McDonnell Douglas hopes for a broader Asian-backed consortiumby attracting other investors.</TEXT></DOC>
