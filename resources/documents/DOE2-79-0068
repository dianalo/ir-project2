A new imagingbed was manufactured in order to shorten the radial length of gamma camerarotation and to avoid the attenuation of gamma ray by the bed duringdata acquisition. A patient lay on the bed in right semidecubitus (50-degree)position and dropped his right arm from the bed. By this method, theradial length of the camera rotation was shortened about 25 % comparedwith the conventional scanning method. In addition, the attenuation ofthe imaging bed was neglected because the projected direction was notoverlapped over the bed during data acquisition from left posterior obliqueviews. Using this new scanning method, tomographic images showed bettercontrast in both phantom and clinical studies and an increased uptakeof radiotracer in cardiac posteroinferior wall compared with the conventionalscanning method. In conclusion, semidecubitus position scanning methodwill be useful for thallium-201 cardiac SPECT.</TEXT></DOC>
