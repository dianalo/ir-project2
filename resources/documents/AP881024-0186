AntonioRoldan Betancur said.   According to police, 13 guerrillas, one policeman and onesoldier were killed, he said.   National police reported that a total of 400 guerrillas attackedthe four towns _ Turbo, Necocli, Saiza and Currulao _ within a fewhours, Roldan said in a broadcast interview with the Colombianradio chain RCN.   Guerrillas have attacked 24 towns and 33 government securityinstallations this year, the worst wave of rebel raids since theguerrillas organized 25 years ago.   An attack on Saiza on Aug. 23 killed 42 people _ 18 guerrillas,12 civilians, 10 soldiers and two policemen.   The governor said the latest attacks were made by the ColombianRevolutionary Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army. Hecalled the raids in the north's banana-growing region an obviousattempt to undermine parts of Colombia prior to a one-day generalstrike declared for Thursday.   Colombia's two largest labor unions _ the Workers' UnitaryCentral and the General Confederation of Labor _ declared thestrike to protest the nation's 22 percent inflation, to demand aprice freeze and an increase in the minimum wage, and to try toforce government action against right-wing death squads.   The army said last week it uncovered plans by Colombia's sixguerrilla groups to send armed rebels into the streets during thestrike and to blow up bridges, highways, communications facilitiesand electric power lines Thursday.   Colombia's last big general strike was in 1977, when 29 peoplewere killed when soldiers fired on rioters in Bogota.   Death squads have killed about 900 people in the last two years,including 180 labor unionists.   The minimum wage in Colombia is about $90 a month. It usually isadjusted once a year to compensate for inflation. The nextadjustment is due in January.</TEXT></DOC>
