The hijacking ended peacefully on Parliament Hill and withoutinjuries when the last five hostages were freed Friday evening,eight hours after the ordeal started in Montreal.   Before surrendering, the hijacker _ who claimed to be holdingdynamite _ held police at bay for five hours after the bus veeredonto the muddy lawn at the center of Canadian government.   Charles Yacoub, 36, of Montreal, was identified as the man whotook over the bus as it left that city. Police said he wasdemanding action on behalf of the Front for the Liberation ofChristian Lebanon, a group that authorities aren't even sure exists.   Private CTV television quoted security sources as saying thegunman was demanding that Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon andfree all the prisoners they hold. Syria sent troops into Lebanon asa peacekeeping force after the civil war between Lebanese Moslemsand Christians erupted in 1975.   Gilles Favreau, assistant commissioner of the Royal CanadianMounted Police, did not say what charges would be filed againstYacoub.   He also could not explain why the police did not know the buswas heading for Parliament until its arrival, which raisedquestions about security in the area.   ``You've got to realize that this bus was going to New York,''Favreau said at a news conference.   Henry Jensen, deputy commissioner of the Mounties, said Yacoubemigrated to Canada from Lebanon in 1976.   The hijacker released the first hostage, an elderly man, at theChamplain Bridge just outside of Montreal before heading on toOttawa, 100 miles to the west.   Three female hostages and one man were released gradually atOttawa, and the male driver left the vehicle just before thehijacking came to an end. Police briefly checked the final fivehostages before concluding they were not involved with the hijacker.   The hijacker had claimed to have explosives, but none were found.   Witnesses said they heard at least three shots, and theybelieved all were fired by the hijacker as police rushed to thesite where the bus was stuck on the lawn in front of the House ofCommons.   The red, white and blue bus sat the extensive lawn of ParliamentHill surrounded by police hiding behind their vehicles or nearbywalls. A police van stopped behind the bus at midafternoon, andofficers jumped out and crouched behind the van's doors.   Traffic was blocked off and and people cleared from the area,including pedestrians at the front of the U.S. Embassy, across thestreet from the House of Commons. stopped.   Forty embassy employees took a difficult route out of thebuilding, dismantling a window in the building next door andcrawling out.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has offices in the House ofCommons but was attending a private event and was not in thebuilding, his aides reported.   Oscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, was speaking at a newsconference a short distance from Parliament Hill as the crisisdeveloped.   Unaware of the hijacking, Arias told reporters, ``Politicalviolence (in Canada) in the worst of times has been limited to themadness of a few.''</TEXT></DOC>
