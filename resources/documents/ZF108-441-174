(Rumors)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Domino's delivers in San JoseandM;While San Jose city officials scramble to land the San Francisco Bay area'snew National Hockey League expansion team, the private sector has been doingits own part to keep the city on the map.andP;  As a result of the near-universalrejection of the fare at Monday's Worldwide Developers' Conference dinner,the assembled Mac faithful were treated to all-American Domino's pizza thefollowing night.andP;  Some Knife informants claim it was the largest Domino'sorder in the history of Northern California, although record keeping before1984 was sketchy.andM;Reactions to the conference itself were more varied.andP;  While most were happyto cough up a grand to be so close to the action, others were less impressed.andO;As one developer put it, &quot;It's almost criminal to bring people here, handthem a useless disc, feed them lousy food and make them pay for theprivilege.&quot;andM;With the Worldwide Developers' Conference now yesterday's news, the Knife hasbegun keeping a list of new product announcements and deliveries in the queuefor this summer's expo in Boston.andP;  One of the first expected announcements onthe list is Aladdin Systems' acquisition of the commercial rights to ZTerm,the popular shareware Mac telecommunications program developed by DaveAlverson.andM;Question and answer.andP;  Many contacts are asking about the status of the Macversion of Symantec's Qandamp;A.andP;  While Symantec hasn't publicly set a ship date,sources close to the project believe it will ship at the expo.andP;  On thesurface, the current version of the product, seen by the Knife's sources,looks remarkably similar to Claris' FileMaker in menu organization andapplications-building features.andM;The feature that Symantec hopes will set Mac Qandamp;A apart from the competitionis its English-language query system called Intelligent Assistant.andP;  Althoughnot yet thoroughly debugged, Intelligent Assistant in Mac Qandamp;A is designed,like the MS-DOS version, to let users build database queries using simpleEnglish syntax.andP;  As an added bonus, Mac users will be able to query both Macand MS-DOS Qandamp;A data files.andP;  For future versions, Symantec is planning toenable Mac users to make Intelligent Assistant queries on other mainstreamMac database files, including ACIUS' 4th Dimension and FileMaker.andP;  Thisshould be interesting.andM;Flexible color.andP;  Sources have told the Knife that Tektronix is developing anew color thermal-transfer printer designed to overcome some of thelimitations of current models.andP;  The printer, which will include an internalPostScript-interpreter clone, will feature serial, parallel and AppleTalkports that are active concurrently, meaning that the printer cansimultaneously handle incoming traffic from all three ports.andP;  If the printeris equipped with enough memory, it will also be able to buffer and queueprint jobs automatically.andP;  The Knife reports that Tektronix, not content tocompete on sophisticated features alone, also plans to market this newprinter at a lower price than other printers of this class sport.andM;Listen up.andP;  While a lot of attention has been lavished on pen-based computerslately, there hasn't been much to show for it.andP;  Meanwhile, Articulate Systemsof Cambridge, Mass., has been working on another natural input device --voice.andP;  The company is set to launch a series of products that could makevoice an integral part of the Mac environment.andP;  At the Developers'Conference, the Knife did some talking to a Macintosh using a new andas-yet-unreleased version of the company's Voice Navigator.andP;  It obeyed hiscommands to open documents and move windows with just a little bit oftraining.andP;  Imagine using voice commands to initiate AppleEvents, so thatInterapplication Communications could be invoked by voice prompts.andM;Articulate Systems also plans a summer release for Voice Link, an audiodigitizer for the Mac with Macintosh Audio Compression Expansion (MACE)embedded on a digital-signal-processor chip.andP;  Looks like some competition atlast for Farallon's MacRecorder.andM;Not all secrets are hidden in handwritten diaries that you have to petitionthe courts to see.andP;  The best Mac secrets are passed on to Mac the Knife, whocan get the news out without cumbersome court proceedings.andP;  Call the Knife at(415) 243-3500 or MCI (MactheKnife).andP;  Your MacWEEK mug could soon be on itsway.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
