(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Craig Thomas gave the Republican Party itsfirst victory of the spring by outdistancing Democrat John Vinichin the race for Wyoming's at-large seat in the U.S. House ofRepresentatives.   With 88 percent of the vote in and just 40 of the 334 precinctsleft to report, unofficial returns gave Thomas 60,262 votes, or 53percent, and Vinich had 49,435, or 43 percent.   Independent Craig McCune received just 4,475 votes, while DanielJohnson, an independent who espoused white separatist views,claimed just 413.   ``Tonight the best man won,'' Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of theNational Republican Congressional Committee, said from hisWashington, D.C., office. ``Craig Thomas won the special electionfor Wyoming's congressional seat because he was a better candidatethan John Vinich.   ``Vinich and the Democrats started with enormous advantages. Ina campaign that was only 40 days long, John Vinich had a toweringlead in name identification and had an established campaignorganization that only five months ago nearly won a U.S. Senateseat.''   Before the polls closed, Howard Schloss of the DemocraticCongressional Campaign Committee complimented Vinich for hiscampaign and touched on the Democratic victories in Indiana andAlabama earlier this year.   ``Our victories in Indiana and Alabama, and our strong showingin the heavily Republican state of Wyoming, proves two things,'' hesaid. ``One, the voters have responded to the Democratic messageand vision for this country.   ``And two, the Republican strategy of divisiveness, hate andgutter politics does not work, and the people will not accept it.From Republican John Rice waving the Confederate flag in Alabama toa Republican pollster spreading lies about John Vinich in Wyoming,the GOP has proven _ and even flaunted _ their gutter tactics.''   The special election was called to fill the House vacancycreated last month when Dick Cheney resigned to become defensesecretary.   At stake in the election was Republican pride, as the GOP lostspecial elections in Indiana and Alabama earlier this year.</TEXT><TEXT>   Cheney's move from the House to the Bush cabinet gave Democratstheir best opportunity since 1978 to gain a seat on thecongressional delegation.   The Democrats fielded Vinich, who has spent 15 years in theLegislature and almost upset Sen. Malcolm Wallop last November. TheGOP countered with Thomas, who just won a third term in the stateHouse of Representatives.   The short campaign centered more on negative politicalportrayals than on specific philosophical differences. Both Vinichand Thomas boasted of being fiscally conservative, in favor ofmultiple use of federal lands, and concerned over health careissues.   Both oppose gun control and voted in the Legislature to restrictpublic funding of abortions.   Both support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that wouldlet states restrict abortion. However, Vinich has been quoted assaying abortion is a matter of personal choice.   Thomas said he was the candidate who aligned best with Sens.Wallop and Alan Simpson.   ``The basic choice will be whether the people want continuity ofthe conservative representation we have had or to move over to theleft of center and send a liberal to represent the state ofWyoming,'' Thomas said often during the campaign.   Vinich denounced Republican effors to paint him as a liberaltied to big labor and stressed that Wyoming must be representedwithin the majority in Congress.   ``I want to be part of a team that makes sure Wyoming gets thebest from both sides of the aisle, from Democrats andRepublicans,'' he said.   The National Republican Congressional Committee at one pointseemed on the verge of torpedoing Thomas' campaign. Ed Rollins, astrategist hired to reverse GOP fortunes, early on declared that hewas calling the shots for Thomas.   Vinich used those comments to charge that Thomas, a 56-year-oldbusinessman, had lost control of his campaign. The 38-year-oldDemocrat also scored the Republicans for a telephone poll thatimplied Vinich was a liar.   Thomas countered by noting that the bulk of Vinich's campaigncontributions came from out-of-state labor groups. He portrayed theDemocrat as beholden to organized labor with little Wyoming support.</TEXT></DOC>
