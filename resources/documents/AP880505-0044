James R. Reilly has been at Children's Hospital Medical Centerhere since Feb. 16, when he fell through the ice while playing atan industrial park near his Cincinnati-area home in northernKentucky's Boone County.   These days J.R., as he is known to family and friends, spendshis time writing, talking with nurses and doctors and playing witha big brown teddy bear near his bed. Doctors aren't saying when hecan go home.   He keeps track of the Reds, his favorite baseball team. ``EricDavis and Pete Rose are my favorites,'' he said.   His youth and vigor are advantages in recovery, and he seemsmore alert, his mother said. He is active in his hospital ward, andhe knows the nurses' and doctors' names.   A physical therapist works on strengthening his legs andimproving hand-eye coordination.   The youngster was rescued by his 14-year-old brother, Michael.``I was scared and cold at first,'' Michael recalled. ``But when Ithought about J.R., I didn't feel cold at all.''   After 20-25 minutes, Michael pulled his brother to shore. OnceJames was out of the water, Charles Deaton, 17, of Newport, Ky.,who was nearby, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation.   He remained in a coma for about a week, but regainedconsciousness. ``We didn't leave the hospital for two weeks,'' saidhis father, Jim.   Since then, J.R. has made steady progress. The accidentdecreased his lung capacity, and he must work to regain hisstrength and coordination, but there has been no sign of braindamage, doctors say.   Doctors have told the parents there will be some permanent lungdamage, though it will be some time before its extent will beknown. The boy still has a tube in his chest that he has to coverin order to speak.   His recovery is credited primarily to a body function called themammalian diving reflex. When the human body is submerged in coldwater for an extended time, the heartbeat slows and oxygen-richblood is sent from the arms and legs to the heart and brain.
