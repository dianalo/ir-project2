The rule establishes eligibility requirements for the participationof elderly persons in the CSFP and procedures whereby States with excessCSFP caseload for women, infants, and children may request Departmentalapproval to convert the excess to serve the elderly. The rule also definesthe procedures that will be used by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)to approve applications for program initiation and expansion.This final rule also amends some provisions of the interim rulemaking.The rule makes changes to the method that will be used to establish States'base caseload levels for each caseload cycle beginning December 1, 1987.All currently participating State agencies, except those entering theirsecond caseload cycle of program operations for women, infants, and childrenor for the elderly, will receive base caseload equal to the greatest ofparticipation for the preceding September, average monthly participationfor the period July through September, or average participation for thepreceding fiscal year. All State agencies entering their second caseloadcycle of program operations for women, infants, and children or for theelderly will receive base caseload equal to the total authorized caseloadlevel for their first cycle of service to either participant subgroup.In addition, beginning with the caseload cycle which commences on or afterDecember 1, 1988, base caseload cannot exceed the total caseload a Stateagency received for the preceding caseload cycle. These changes in basecaseload assignment will promote sound caseload management by State agenciesand will ensure a more equitable caseload assignment system.Clarifications concerning certification procedures for the elderly explainin greater detail State agency responsibilities at each even-numbered certificationin order to facilitate States' efforts to ensure accountability in thecertification process. In addition, the final rule makes several minorchanges and clarifications in response to public comment.Finally, this rulemaking also implements mandates of the Rural Development,Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202),enacted on December 22, 1987, regarding allocation of resources betweencurrently participating and newly applying State agencies. These requirements,which affect only the first caseload cycle to begin after December 1, 1987,are in essential accord with the order of funding established in the interimrule and confirmed in this final rule, except that (1) limits are imposedon resources available to currently participating State agencies and (2)each new State agency's share of available caseload is based on the sizeof its request without consideration for its relative need.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ronald Vogel, Director, SupplementalFood Programs Division, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S.D.A., 3101 ParkCenter Drive, Room 407, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 756-3746.

This rule will notresult in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individualindustries; Federal, State, or local government agencies; or geographicregions. Nor will this rule have a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets.This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Pursuant to that review, the Administratorof the Food and Nutrition Service has determined that this final rule doesnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. The reporting requirements established in this rulemaking areunder review by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance withthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).In response to public comments on the interim rule, this final rule makessignificant changes to the method that will be used by FNS to allocatecaseload to State agencies for program operations. In addition, this rulecontains two provisions for Fiscal Year 1988 caseload assignments requiredby the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies AppropriationsAct, 1988 (section 101(k) of Pub. L. 100-202) enacted on December 22, 1987.The first provision required by Pub. L. 100-202 is a cap on the numberof participants who can be served in Fiscal Year 1988 at existing sites.The provision of this rule containing this change constitutes an interpretativerule since it merely implements the statutorily required participationcap of Pub. L. 100-202. Since 5 U.S.C. 552(b) does not require notice ofproposed rulemaking for interpretative rules unless required by anotherstatute and since there is no other such statutory requirement, this provisionis being made final without prior public comment.The second statute-based provision concerns a modification to the proceduresused to assign caseload to new States in Fiscal Year 1988. While the detailsof the caseload assignment are not specifically described in the statute,H.R. Rep. 100-498, the Conference Report accompanying Pub. L. 100-202,provides indication of congressional intent that funds available for newStates be distributed in a slightly different manner than that set forthin the current rule. In order to implement congressional intent, this finalrule contains a provision which was not proposed. However, since this changeis necessary only for the assignment of caseload to new States in FiscalYear 1988, and since that assignment must occur as soon as possible inorder to permit new States to use their Fiscal Year 1988 allocations tothe fullest extent possible, prior public comment would be both impracticableand contrary to the public interest. For these reasons and in accordancewith 5 U.S.C. 553(b), Anna Kondratas, Administrator of FNS, has determinedthat good cause exists for making this provision of the final rule effectivewithout prior public comment.Finally, Anna Kondratas, Administrator of FNS, has determined that a post-publicationwaiting period prior to implementation of this entire rule is impracticableand contrary to the public interest, and that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)good cause exists for making this rule effective immediately upon promulgation.This determination is based on the fact that a 30-day waiting period wouldresult in the delay in the implementation of most of the important changescontained in this rule until the next caseload cycle which begins on orafter December 1, 1988. This delay would adversely affect the operationof this program, and, with respect to the changes required by Pub. L. 100-202,would contravene the statute. Making this rule effective on publicationwill enable FNS to use these new procedures in making the 1988 caseloadassignments.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.565 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, whichrequires intergovernment consultation with State and local officials (7CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, and final rule-related notice published June24, 1983 (48 FR 29112)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On December 23, 1985 the President signed the Food Security Act of 1985(Public Law 99-198). The law amends section 5 of the Agriculture and ConsumerProtection Act of 1973 (7 U.S.C. 612c note) to require the Secretary to(1) establish eligibility requirements for the expanded participation ofelderly persons in the CSFP, (2) establish procedures to allow local agenciescurrently administering the CSFP to serve elderly persons as long as servicelevels for women, infants and children are not reduced; (3) protect the``existing caseloads'' of the three established elderly feeding sites inDetroit, Michigan; New Orleans, Louisiana and Des Moines, Iowa and participationlevels of the operating CSFP sites; and (4) approve applications of additionalsites for the program in areas in which the program does not operate, providedthat funds for program initiation are available. In response to Pub. L.99-198, the Department published an interim rule for the CSFP in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 32895) on September 17, 1986. The Departmentexercised discretion in the interim rule regarding the process that wouldbe used by FNS in the allocation of caseload for expanded program servicesin currently participating States and commencement of program operationsin newly approved CSFP State agencies. The Department provided an extensivecomment period which ended on February 1, 1987. A lengthy comment periodwas provided in order to allow States sufficient time to implement theregulatory provisions and observe their impact on program administrativeand operational procedures before submitting comments. During the commentperiod, 17 comment letters were received from a variety of sources, includingCSFP State and local agency staff, Special Supplemental Food Program forWomen, Infants and Children (WIC) State agency staff, local health professionals,State Department of Human Services staff and advocacy groups. The Departmentwould like to thank all of those commenters who responded to the interimrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments</ITAG>Of the timely comment letters received, the majority were in support ofthe provisions of the interim rule. However, six of the commenters opposedthe procedures established by the Department to allocate caseload to Stateagencies for program operations. These comments will be discussed in detaillater in the preamble. One State agency submitted eight comment letterswhich opposed the income eligibility criteria and certification periodestablished for the participation of elderly persons certified for theprogram after September 17, 1986. These commenters recommended that allStates be allowed to establish elderly eligibility requirements as hadthe three State agencies which administered the original elderly feedingpilot projects. This recommendation was not acted upon because the eligibilitycriteria established in the interim rule reflect the Department's effortto concentrate program benefits on persons most in need. Income is thebest index of need for this population. The Department also declined toadopt several other recommendations, each of which was submitted by onlyone commenter. It was suggested that the definition of ``homebound elderlypersons'' be modified to provide more detailed guidelines, rather thanrelying so heavily on the ``judgment of the local agency.'' The Department,however, believes that the local agency is in the best position to establishguidelines for determining which elderly persons need assistance in obtainingfood packages, as well as to apply the guidelines to the individual circumstancesof elderly applicants. Another commenter recommended that the Departmentconsider children up to age six when establishing the program service needsof States which request initiation or expansion caseload, since childrenup to age six are a part of the CSFP eligible population. Data on childrenup to age five is being used by the Department because sufficiently reliabledata on eligible children over age five is not available. A commenter recommendedthat elderly initiation and expansion caseload requests be provided basedon the number and/or percentage of economically disadvantaged elderly ina State because this approach would be a fairer method for allocating caseloadslots. According to the most recent census data, the low-income elderlypopulation in existing CSFP States is so large compared with the resourcesavailable to serve it that relative need is not a realistic basis for caseloadallocation. Providing equal shares is the most reasonable and equitablemethod for allocating expansion and initiation caseload for service tothe elderly.Relatively few changes have been made in the final rule. The Departmenthas decided to repeat sections of the preamble to the interim rule whichaddress the more complex parts of the interim rule that are unchanged infianl regulations in order to enhance public understanding. All referencesin the interim rule which apply only to the caseload cycle beginning December1, 1986 have been deleted from the final rule. Several clarifications havealso been made in the final rule in response to commenters' recommendations.The regulatory language in this final rule includes both sections of theinterim rule that are unchanged and amendments to the interim rule so thatreaders will have easy access in a single document to all CSFP regulationsimplementing Pub. L. 99-198. Section 247.10 contains clarifications andsubstantive changes; clarifications also appear in andSection;andSection; 247.5and 247.7. Amendments implementing Pub. L. 100-202, which affects onlythe first caseload cycle to begin after December 1, 1987, are concentratedin a new andSection; 247.24.1. Definitions (Section 247.2)<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Caseload </ITAG>The definition of ``caseload'' serves to distinguish it clearly from participation.``Caseload'' means the monthly average number of persons a State agencyis authorized by FNS to serve over a specified period of time. The caseloadassigned establishes a limit on the total number of food packages whichcan be provided during the specified period. b. The definition of ``caseload cycle'' supports a shift in caseload assignmentscheduling which will yield more predictability and regularity in the caseloadassignment and management processes. The annual caseload cycle will beginthe later of December 1, or a date not to exceed 30 days after enactmentof appropriations legislation covering the full fiscal year, and end November30.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Elderly Persons </ITAG>Elderly participation was originally established on a limited-term basisthrough pilot projects. Relatively few requirements were initially setin order to permit the experimentation appropriate to pilot projects andbecause Congress had not made a long-term commitment to elderly feedingunder the CSFP. Now that Congress has, in Pub. L. 99-198, reauthorizedthese elderly feeding operations through Fiscal Year 1990, and providedfor elderly feeding at other sites, it has accordingly mandated that theSecretary define low-income elderly persons to establish eligibility requirementsfor their participation. In its definition of ``elderly persons,'' theDepartment has established a minimum age of 60 years as the basic eligibilityrequirement for program participation. This minimum age was selected becauseit is widely used by Federal food assistance programs which provide benefitsto the elderly. It has been used as an eligibility criterion for programbenefits under the three established elderly feeding sites since theirinception.2. State agency plan of program operation and administration (Section 247.5)<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Expansion/Initiation Request Timeframes (Section 247.5(a))</ITAG>Section 247.5(a) stresses that requests to initiate or expand CSFP operationsmust be made through State Plans. A clarification has also been made tothis section to specify that the procedures and timeframes for State Plansubmission and FNS approval as outlined in andSection; 247.5(a) of the CSFPregulations published on January 21, 1981 will apply to State Plans conveyingrequests to initiate or expand CSFP opertions. Only those States with planswhich are approved by the beginning of the fiscal year may compete forassignments in the next caseload cycle. States with plans approved afterthis date will not compete for caseload until the following cycle unlesssufficient resources become available in the interim. In approving a State Plan or amendment to initiate or expand program operations,FNS will specify the number of caseload slots it believes the State canuse, and which the State has the administrative capacity to manage. Thisdetermination will be based on the content of the Plan or amendment, demographicdata, past performance of the State agency, and other information whichFNS considers relevant. This intention to set caseload limitations duringthe State plan approval process based on States' needs and management capacitieswas stated in the preamble to the interim rule. However, it was not clearlyexpressed in andSection; 247.5(a) of the interim rule, which has been revisedaccordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Commencing Service to Elderly Persons (Section 247.5(a)) </ITAG>Section 247.5(a) requires all currently operating CSFP State agencies wishingto convert a portion of their caseload to serve elderly persons to submitrequests to provide such service, in the form of State Plan amendments,not less than 90 days after the beginning of the caseload cycle for whichthe request is being made. The Department believes that a specified waitingperiod is necessary in order to ensure that State agencies allow theirlocal agencies sufficient time during the caseload cycle in which conversionis approved to meet the full level of demand of women, infants and childrenin the service area before the needs of the elderly are addressed. Requests to convert excess caseload to elderly service are approved forone caseload cycle only. To the extent that conversion caseload is used,it becomes part of the base caseload (andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(ii)) assignedfor the next cycle. As base and expansion caseloads fluctuate from cycleto cycle, the appropriateness of caseload conversion must be newly assessedafter caseloads have been assigned and demand has asserted itself duringeach caseload cycle. For example, State A requests and is granted permissionto convert 100 caseload slots originally assigned to serve women, infantsand children to elderly service. At the end of the caseload cycle for whichconversion authority is granted, State A has converted all 100 slots toelderly participation. Therefore, the 100 slots become part of State A'selderly base caseload for the next cycle. However, the conversion authorizationState A utilized in the last cycle does not apply to caseload allocatedfor the next cycle. If State A wishes to convert additional caseload inthe next cycle, it must request and receive permission to do so. State Plan requirements in andSection; 247.5(a) (15) and (16) apply to CSFPState agencies which request permission to serve elderly persons, eitherwith converted caseload originally intended for women, infants and children,or with additional caseload assigned for the elderly. All such State agenciesmust document the existence of a low-income elderly population sufficientin number to justify requests. They must also describe how they will accommodatethe homebound elderly. In authorizing the original elderly feeding pilotprojects, Congress stressed home delivery of food packages. The Departmentbelieves that the special needs of the homebound should not be forgottenwhile serving the elderly.In accordance with Pub. L. 99-198 State agencies currently administeringthe CSFP with excess caseload will be authorized to convert slots to elderlyservice to the extent that the demand for service to women, infants, andchildren can still be met. Section 247.5(a)(16) requires that States requestingto convert caseload meet one additional State Plan requirement. They mustdemonstrate that the requested number of caseload slots can, in fact, bedevoted to the elderly without restricting service to women, infants andchildren. The Department will require the submission of data, such as historicalparticipation levels and other documentation, which demonstrates that needsof women, infants and children in the service area have been adequatelyaddressed by the Program. This other documentation may include evidenceof outreach efforts such as community contacts, printed materials, mediacontacts and/or contacts made through public agencies which provide serviceto low-income women, infants and children. 3. Certification (Section 247.7) <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Establishment of Elderly Persons as a Categorically Eligible Population(Section 247.7(a)) </ITAG>Elderly persons certified for the first time on or after September 17,1986 must have incomes at or below 130 percent of Federal Proverty IncomeGuidelines. Selecting this criterion for income eligibility representsan effort by the Department to concentrate benefits on the neediest, andincome is the best index of need for this population. In accordance withandSection; 247.7(a)(4), the State agency may require that all categoriesof eligible persons, including the elderly, undergo a nutritional riskassessment as part of the eligibility determination. Elderly persons whowere certified before September 17, 1986 are subject to the terms and conditionsof participation in effect on the date of their certification. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Priority System (Section 247.7(b)(2)) </ITAG>Section 247.7(b)(2) integrates elderly persons into the CSFP priority system.To ensure that women, infants and children have priority access to programbenefits, elderly persons have been placed below women, infants, and childrenin the participant priority system, in a new Priority Level V. The expandedpriority system must be applied by each State agency which has been approvedto concert CSFP caseload to serve the elderly or has received caseloadto serve the elderly at any site in addition to the levels of participationin December 1985 for the three established elderly feeding projects. With the exception of caseload equal to December 1985 participation levelsof the three original elderly feeding projects, caseload made availableto the elderly may not be reserved for them. Rather, such caseload representsa maximum number of slots that can be used to serve the elderly. Beforeall such slots have been filled, women, infants, children, and the elderlyhave equal access to them. Once these slots have been filled, women, infants,and children must be enrolled before elderly applicants as slots becomeavailable in accordance with the participant priority system. As indicated above, the participant priority system does not apply to caseloadequalling December 1985 participation at the three original elderly projects;these minimum caseload levels are guaranteed in accordance with Pub. L.99-198 to be available for the elderly through Fiscal Year 1990. This caseloadmust be reserved exclusively for service to the elderly, consistent withPub. L. 99-198. Consider, for example, one of the three original elderlyfeeding projects which is the only site under the State's CSFP and hasa protected elderly project caseload of 1,000. The State has received permissionto convert up to 500 CSFP caseload slots, which were originally assignedfor women, infants, and children, to elderly service. At this site, thepriority system does not apply to elderly persons until elderly participationreaches 1,000. Thereafter, women, infants, and children and the elderlyhave equal access to the 500 conversion slots until total CSFP caseloadis reached. Then, as slots become available, the priority system is appliedto conversion slots, giving precedence to women, infants, and children.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Certification Periods for Elderly Persons (Section 247.7(g)(1)(iii))</ITAG>A maximum certification period of 6 months has been established for allelderly participants certified on or after September 17, 1986. Althoughduration of participation was not limited at the three elderly feedingpilot projects, the Department believes that certification periods havebecome necessary for future participants since elderly feeding under theCSFP has been significantly broadened in scope and reauthorized throughFiscal Year 1990. A periodic eligibility assessment for elderly certificationis necessary to ensure that benefits are directed only to eligible persons.The Department has established the same certification period for the elderlyas for all other participant categories (except pregnant women) to providefor a timely eligibility reassessment and to more quickly accommodate eligiblewomen, infants, and children who are waiting to receive program benefits.Because the eligibility status of the elderly is not as subject to changeas that of women, infants and children, in the interim rule the Departmentallowed States to review the information in the certification record asthe basis for establishing continued program eligibility for the elderlyat the second and any subsequent even-numbered certifications. However,one commenter questioned the efficacy of this procedure. Upon reconsideration,the Department concludes that this provision does not fully meet the intentof ensuring accountability in the certification process at each even-numberedcertification. Therefore, the requirement for a review of the existentrecord at each even-numbered certification has been deleted. Instead, localagencies are required to implement a procedure established by their Stateagencies for contacting each elderly participant at the end of each even-numberedcertification to confirm the participant's address and continued interestin program participation. <T3>If there are not women, infants, or children waiting to be served,</T3>local agencies may, State agency policy permitting, certify such elderlypersons for an additional 6 months without a review of the existent recordor collection of new eligibility data. The Department believes that contactwith the participant prior to each even-numbered certification promotesbetter program accountability and is in the best interest of the participantsince the nature of the service delivery system to the elderly under theCSFP tends to otherwise minimize local agency/participant contact. As inthe interim rule, the State agency must, at the end of each 12 months ofparticipation, conduct a full eligibility assessment, based on newly submittedinformation, including income and, if applicable, residency and nutritionalrisk. With the exception of the protected caseload of the three originalelderly feeding projects, elderly persons are to be placed on a waitinglist at the end of any 6-month certification period in numbers sufficientto make room for any eligible women, infants or children waiting to beserved. Elderly persons certified before September 17, 1986 are subjectto the terms and conditions of participation in effect on the date of theircertification. 4. Caseload Allocation and Administrative Funding (247.10)<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Caseload Allocation (Section 247.10(a))</ITAG>Public Law 100-202 requires minor modifications of the procedures discussedbelow for the first caseload cycle to begin after December 1, 1987. Theseone-time modifications are discussed in section 5 of the preamble. Forsubsequent cycles, caseload will be allocated according to the followingprocedures, without modification. In accordance with the provisions of Pub. L. 99-198, the Department establishedin the interim rulemaking the following order of caseload allocation toensure (1) full and efficient utilization of program appropriations and(2) assignment of caseload to expand or initiate operation where it ismost needed:<T3>Step 1: </T3>The three original elderly feeding sites in Detroit, NewOrleans and Des Moines are assigned caseload at levels equal to their participationin December 1985, when Pub. L. 99-198 was enacted; <T3>Step 2: </T3>Currently participating CSFP State agencies are assignedcaseload to support actual participation levels of women, infants and children;<T3>Step 3: </T3>Currently participating CSFP State agencies are assignedcaseload to support elderly participation in addition to the caseload equalto the December 1985 level for participation at the three original elderlyfeeding sites; <T3>Step 4: </T3>Currently participating State agencies receive caseloadto expand service to women, infants and children; <T3>Step 5: </T3>Currently participating State agencies receive caseloadto initiate or expand service to elderly persons; and <T3>Step 6: </T3>Requests from State agencies to initiate program servicesfor women, infants and children are approved. Six commenters opposed the established order of funding for program initiationand expansion. The commenters requested that the order be changed in thefinal rule so that new State agencies are considered for caseload for programinitiation earlier in the caseload allocation process. Four of these commentersspecifically recommended that existing State agencies seeking to expandservice to women, infants and children and new State agencies wanting toenter the CSFP be considered concurrently for caseload based on their rankedorder of penetration potential (i.e., that steps 4 and 6 be combined).One of the commenters recommended that new State agency requests be givenpriority over the expansion of elderly service under the program (i.e.,that Steps 5 and 6 be reversed). Another commenter recommended that requestsof newly applying State agencies be given priority over expansion requestsof existing State agencies for services to women, infants and children(i.e., that Step 6 precede Step 4). The commenters believe that such adjustmentsare necessary in order to ensure the primacy of women, infants and childrenin the program. While it should be noted that Congress give precedenceto elderly persons at the three original projects over all women, infantsand children, the Department agrees with commenters that the general primacyof women, infants and children must be maintained as the CSFP expands toserve low-income elderly persons. Provisions have been established throughoutthe regulations which reflect this intention. The established caseload allocation procedure ensures maintenance of servicelevels for women, infants and children before elderly service levels aresupported, with the exception of the three original elderly projects, whichhave first access to available resources under the law. The rule requiresState agencies wishing to serve the elderly by converting a portion oftheir caseload originally allocated to serve women, infants and childrento provide the Department with assurances that such service will not restrictservice to women, infants and children. A 90-day waiting period is imposedon State agencies wishing to request permission to convert caseload toserve the elderly. This mandatory waiting period insures that local agencieshave sufficient time to meet the full level of demand of women, infantsand children in the service area before the needs of the elderly are addressed.Elderly persons are placed below women, infants and children in the participantpriority system. Women, infants, children and the elderly have equal accessto caseload made available for elderly service (excepting the protectedcaseloads of the three original projects) and caseload which has been authorizedfor conversion to elderly service. Conversion caseload may not be reservedexclusively for the elderly. When all such caseload has been filled, thepriority system ensures first access for women, infants and children asslots become available. Further, State agencies approved to initiate CSFPservices are prohibited from converting caseload to serve elderly personsduring their first 12 months of program operations. The Department believesthat these provisions afford considerable assurances that the needs ofwomen, infants and children will maintain their priority in the CSFP. Furthermore,the Department maintains that currently operating CSFP States should havea primary claim on any resources available for program expansion becausetheir experience in administering the program enables them to deliver programbenefits more efficiently than newly established programs. Therefore, theDepartment has retained in the final rule the order of caseload allocationestablished in the interim rule. The Department believes that the commenters' concerns can be addressedwithout changing the order of funding. Under the interim rule, currentlyparticipating State agencies would receive base caseload (Steps 2 and 3)equal to the greater of their participation for September or average participationfor the period July through September. Thus, States which were slow tobuild participation toward the beginning of a caseload cycle could increasetheir participation drastically at the end. This unrepresentatively highparticipation level would be assigned as base caseload for the followingcycle. Thus the possibility of resources being available for new Stateagencies (Step 6) would be significantly diminished. In order to preventthis from occurring, the Department has amended andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(ii)to specify that, beginning with the caseload cycle which commences on orafter December 1, 1988, the base caseload assigned to a State may not exceedtotal caseload the State received in the previous cycle. This restrictionapplies separately to caseload for women, infants, and children, on theone hand, and the elderly, on the other. Of course all participating Stateagencies may be eligible to compete for expansion caseload in additionto their base caseload. Additional changes to the procedure for determining base caseload havebeen made in response to comments. Section 247.10(a)(2)(ii) of the interimrule specifies that base caseload levels will be provided in amounts equalto the greater of State agencies' participation during September or theaverage monthly participation for the period July through September. Onecommenter recommended that caseload levels be provided based on the greatestof participation for September or average monthly participation for theperiod July through September or for the prior fiscal year. The commenterbelieved that a more accurate picture of actual participation activityin a State can be achieved by considering all three periods. Fiscal Year1986 participation data supports this position. In seven of the thirteenCSFP States, average participation for Fiscal Year 1986 exceeded averageparticipation for both September and the period July through September.In view of these data and the commenter's recommendation, the Departmentwill assign base caseload by using the greatest of the three participationlevels except that, as discussed above, the maximum base caseload a Stateagency can receive will be an amount equal to the State's total authorizedcaseload level for the preceding caseload cycle.The final change in the procedure for establishing base caseload has beenmade in response to a commenter's concern about the ability of State agenciesto compete for expansion caseload in their second cycle of program operations.Under the interim regulations (andSection; 247.10(a)(2) (iii)(A) and (iv)(A)),States could compete for expansion caseload only if they met the standardof 90 percent caseload utilization. (This standard is fully discussed laterin the preamble.) The commenter believes that this standard should be waivedfor States entering their second and perhaps third caseload cycles so thatsuch States will not build their programs too fast at the outset in orderto qualify for expansion caseload. The Department agrees that the regulatoryenvironment should encourage new State agencies to develop their programsin a gradual and deliberate manner, within their management capabilities.This same reasoning applies to established State agencies which have newlybegun service to the elderly. They, too, must pass through an initial phaseof learning and experimentation in their efforts to reach this new population.Pressures for premature growth in both situations could lead States toincrease participation at a rate faster than their management systems canfully accommodate. However, the Department believes that due to the lessstable growth patterns and potentials for such State agencies, applyingthe commenter's recommendation to States newly serving women, infants andchildren, or the elderly, could result in significant amounts of unusedcaseload during the State's second caseload cycle of service to eitherparticipant subgroup.Given these considerations, to address the commenter's concern, the Departmenthas further modified andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(ii) to specify that, fundspermitting, all State agencies entering their second cycle of caseloadoperations for women, infants and children <T3>or </T3>for the elderly will be assigned base caseload for the participantsubgroup at the same level authorized for their first cycle. For example,new State agencies A, B, and C each received a caseload of 100 to initiateprogram services to women, infants and children for their first cycle ofoperations. The greatest of participation for September or average monthlyparticipation for July-September or for the fiscal year for these Stateswas 80, 90, and 110, respectively. For its second cycle, State A will receivea base caseload of 100, but it will not be eligible to receive expansioncaseload for women, infants, and children for its second cycle. StatesB and C will also receive a base caseload of 100, and they will be eligiblefor expansion caseload because they have met the 90-percent standard. Notethat unconditional reassignment of the prior year's caseload provides thesame base caseload limit for State agencies entering their second cycleas applies to all other State agencies. Thus State C's base caseload iscapped at 100 despite its participation of 110. Of course this State mayreceive additional caseload in subsequent steps of the allocation process.The Department believes that this response to the commenter's concern willpromote responsible utilization of caseload by State agencies enteringtheir second cycle of caseload operations for women, infants, and childrenor for the elderly by applying to them a less restrictive method for establishingbase caseload. Yet his change will at the same time ensure that caseloadlevels in these States do not exceed what can reasonably be expected tobe used during their second cycle of program service to either participantsubgroup. This concludes the discussion of base caseload assignment (Steps2 and 3).The only commenter expressing concerns regarding the mechanics of Step4 of the interim system for caseload allocation, which ensures that expansioncaseload for women, infants and children is allocated where it is mostneeded, did not fully understand this step. All States requesting additionalcaseload for this purpose which have met the 90-percent standard are rankedaccording to the extent to which their Federal program resources permitthem to penetrate their income-eligible populations. That is, States areranked based on their potential to serve, under the Special SupplementalFood Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and the CSFP, categoricallyeligible women, infants and children up to the age of 5 at or below thecurrent income guidelines for reduced-price meals under section 9 of theNational School Lunch Act. (Currently, the limit is 185 percent of theFederal Poverty Income Guidelines).The maximum expansion caseload which the State with the lowest potentialto penetrate its income-eligible population can receive in the first roundof this iterative allocation equals the amount of caseload necessary tobring its penetration potential up to the penetration potential of thenext State agency in the ranked order. Each successive round of allocationincludes the next-lowest-ranked State. If sufficient resources are available,the iterations continue until all States receive the lesser of (1) theformulaic maximum for which they are eligible or (2) the amount of expansioncaseload FNS has determined that the State agencies can manage effectively.If funds are not sufficient to provide all applicant States their appropriateexpansion caseload, States participating in the final round of allocationsreceive assignments enabling all of them to achieve the same level of penetration.In no case is a State awarded caseload in excess of its request.The Department uses income eligibility as the sole basis to approximatethe eligible population level in each State because sufficiently accuratedata necessary to use nutrition risk as an additional basis for such determinationis not available at this time. The following illustrates the process ofassigning caseload for expansion. In order to more clearly exemplify theformulaic aspects of the assignment process, the illustration is basedon the assumption that all applicant States have requested, and have beenapproved to receive, the maximum expansion caseload for which they areeligible.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Caseload to Assign: 2564</T4><H1>State</H1><H1>Income eligible population</H1><H1>WIC/CSFP Federal resources can serve</H1><H1>Percent potential penetration</H1><H1>Caseload assignment</H1><H2>Round 1</H2><H3>Caseload</H3><H3>Penetration potential (percent)</H3><H2>Round 2</H2><H3>Caseload</H3><H3>Penetration potential (percent)</H3><H2>Round 3</H2><H3>Caseload</H3><H3>Penetration potential (percent)</H3><H2>Round 4 \1\</H2><H3>Caseload</H3><H3>Penetration potential (percent)</H3><ITAG tagnum="1">A <D>1000</D><D>225</D><D>23</D><D>80</D><D>31</D><D>90</D><D>40</D><D>290</D><D>69</D><D>102</D><D>79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B <D>750</D><D>230</D><D>31</D><D/><D/><D>68</D><D>40</D><D>218</D><D>69</D><D>77</D><D>79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C <D>3000</D><D>1200</D><D>40</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>870</D><D>69</D><D>308</D><D>79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D <D>4500</D><D>3100</D><D>69</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>461</D><D>79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">E <D>4000</D><D>3200</D><D>80</D><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D>\2\</D><D>80</D><D/><D>238</D><D/><D>1616</D><D/><D>2564</D><D/><F>\1\ Based on the number of slots (948) which remained available forallocation after Round 3, only States A, B, and C would have received sufficientcaseload to bring their penetration up to the 80-percent level of StateE.

However, the intentionto establish such a limit was not clearly expressed in all appropriatesections of the final rule. As discussed above, the appropriate paragraphon State Plan approval (andSection; 247.5(a)) has been amended accordingly.A conforming amendment has also been made in andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(iv)(B),which sets forth procedures for assigning elderly caseload. The Departmenthas clarified in this section of the final rule that State agencies willreceive expansion caseload for the elderly based on the lesser of (1) theirequal share of available caseload, or (2) the amount of expansion caseloadFNS has determined that the State agency can effectively manage. If anyState's approved share exceeds its request, the excess will be dividedequally among States whose approved requests exceed their shares. Expansioncaseload limits for women, infants, children and the elderly will be establishedby FNS based on an assessment of each State's capability to effectivelymanage additional administrative and operational responsibilities, pastperformance and other information which FNS considers relevant.In order to promote full utilization of available funds, only States whoseparticipation of women, infants, and children for September, or averagemonthly participation for the period July through September or for theprior fiscal year equals at least 90 percent of their CSFP caseload, minusany portion of such caseload approved for conversion, are eligible to competefor additional caseload for women, infants and children to expand operationsin the following caseload cycle (andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(iii)(A)). The procedurefor determining how much of its caseload a State agency used has been changedfrom the interim to the final rule to include consideration of its averagemonthly participation for the fiscal year. This change conforms with themodification of the method for determining base caseloads (andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(ii)).The Department believes that caseload for program expansion should be allocatedonly to States which have clearly demonstrated the ability to effectivelyutilize their assigned caseload. This same limit is applied with regardto utilization of caseload made available for service to the elderly, includingconversion slots (andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(iv)(A)). Thus, existing Stateagencies are eligible to receive additional caseload to serve the elderlyonly if they have utilized to least 90 percent of the total caseload availablefor service to the elderly, including conversion caseload.Caseload remaining after <T3>expansion</T3> requests have been addressed is allocated to State agenciesseeking to <T3>initiate</T3> the program. These States are ranked according to theirpotential to serve the income-eligible population through the WIC Program,based on Federal resources provided under WIC. Then caseload is assignedto them using the same procedure (discussed above) applied to existingprograms seeking to expand service to women, infants and children. Duringtheir first 12 months of operation, these States cannot convert caseloadto the service of the elderly so that the population of women, infants,and children will first be able to reach its full level of demand. As discussedearlier, these States will be provided their prior year's authorized caseloadfor their second cycle of program operations, funds permitting.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Administrative Funding (247.10(b))</ITAG>This section of the interim rule remains unchanged. Section 247.10(b)(2)establishes that each State's share of 15 percent of the total appropriation,which is set aside for program administration, will be proportionate tothe State's share of the total caseload assigned. Administrative fundingcannot be based solely on a State's participation levels, as specifiedin past regulations, because that approach would not provide adequate administrativeresources to support newly establised opportunities for program expansion.This section also indicates that whatever caseload and unspent administrativefunds may be recovered by FNS during the fiscal year will be reallocatedin accordance with the order of caseload allocation established under andSection;247.10(a). Beyond basic expenses covered by the percentage of each State'sadministrative grant guaranteed by andSection; 247.10(b)(4), State's administrativecosts should generally correlate with their participation levels. Thusin the event that FNS recovers unused caseload from a State agency, administrativefunds which would have been needed to manage to unused caseload shouldalso be available for recovery.5. Temporary Effects of Pub. L. 100-202 on Caseload AllocationThe Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies AppropriationsAct, 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202), enacted December 22, 1987, mandates severalminor, temporary modifications to CSFP resource allocation procedures.These changes apply only to the funds appropriated under this law, whichwill be fully allocated for the first caseload cycle to begin after December1, 1987. A new andSection; 247.24, which has been added to encompass thesemodifications, will have no effect whatsoever on program administrationand operations beginning with the caseload cycle that commences on or afterDecember 1, 1988.Pub. L. 100-202 requires that $8 million of the $50 million it appropriatesfor the CSFP be allocated to the elderly projects in Detroit, Des Moines,and New Orleans. This mandate will be met through the order of fundingestablished in the interim rules and republished in andSection; 246.10(a)of this final rule. This new legislation also requires that resources remainingafter sufficient funds have been allocated to serve 145,000 women, infants,and children and 80,000 elderly persons under existing State agencies bemade available to serve women, infants, and children under new State agencies.This legislative provision is also thoroughly consistent with the establishedregulatory order of funding. The law requires, as do the regulations, thatbase and expansion caseload be assigned to currently participating Stateagencies before requests from newly applying State agencies are addressed.While Pub. L. 100-202 does not change the established order of funding,it does alter the results of applying the order. That is, although currentlyparticipating State agencies continue to have priority over newly applyingState agencies, the one-time caps on caseload available to the former ensurethat funds will be available in this cycle to admit approved applicantState agencies. These caps are embodied in the newly established andSection;247.24.The Conference Report (H.R. Rep. 100-498) accompanying Pub. L. 100-202advises that the Department should, in implementing these one-time legislativechanges, (1) allow all applicant State agencies with approved State Plansto share in resources available for new starts, and (2) divide such resourcesproportionally among such State agencies. In keeping with this congressionaldirective, the ratio of each approved State's caseload request to the totalcaseload requested by approved State agencies will determine that State'sproportional share of available resources. This departure from the formulaestablished in andSection; 247.10(a)(2)(v) appears in the new andSection; 247.24,which applies only to the first caseload cycle to begin after December1, 1987. Thereafter, the Department will revert to the established methodfor allocating resources to new State agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 247</ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Food assistance programs, Maternal and childhealth, Infants and children, Public assistance programs, Nutrition, Women,Commodity Supplemental Food Program.Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 247 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 247_COMMODITY SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD PROGRAM</ITAG>1.
