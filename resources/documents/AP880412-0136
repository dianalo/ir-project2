Boys generally outscore girls on the qualifying test to becomeNational Merit semifinalists, just as they do on the ScholasticAptitude Test and other standardized exams.   But FairTest, a group also known as the National Center for Fairandamp; Open Testing, said girls perform better in class than boys. Itsaid high school grades should count just as much as the testscores when the 15,000 National Merit semifinalists are chosen eachyear.   The sponsor, the National Merit Scholarship Corp., said thatwould drive up the cost of administering the prestigious awardprogram and reduce the amount available for scholarships.   Sarah Stockwell of FairTest called the National MeritScholarship Corp.'s reliance on the Preliminary Scholastic AptitudeTest to select semifinalists ``extraordinarily irresponsible'' andsaid it costs women ``millions of dollars each year.''   Marianne Roderick, a senior vice president of the National MeritScholarship Corp. in Evanston, Ill., said 63 percent of this year'sNational Merit semifinalists are boys.   ``It has been true over a number of years that boys outnumbergirls by about 60-40, sometimes a little more, sometimes a littleless,'' she said.   She defended the use of the standardized test to selectsemifinalists. ``The merit program is open to more than a millionyoungsters who enter it each year and we have no quotas regardingboys or girls or ethnic origin or anything else.''   Using the test ``is the best method we have found to date tomake entry to the program available ... at a relatively nominalfee,'' she said, adding that switching to some other method ofselection would drive up administrative costs.   Once the 15,000 semifinalists are chosen, the National MeritScholarship Corp. does look at their high school grades,extracurricular activities and achievements in whittling the fielddown to 6,000 winners who receive scholarships ranging from $250 to$8,000.   Last year, among the 6,146 who got scholarships, 62 percent wereboys and 38 percent were girls, Roderick said.   The activist group said it also suspects that minorities areunderrepresented among the ranks of the National Merit winners,despite special awards earmarked for black students.   The organization sponsors a separate National AchievementScholarship Program for Outstanding Negro Students that awardsabout 700 scholarships annually, but Roderick said it does notcollect ethnic data from other contestants.   Many colleges vie in recruiting National Merit winners and somefund their own scholarships through the National Merit program.Corporations and the National Merit Scholarship Corp. itselfprovide the other scholarships.   The Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, also called theNational Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test, is essentially the sameas the Scholastic Aptitude Test, although it is scored on adifferent scale. In selecting semifinalists, the verbal scorecounts twice as much as the math score.   The overall qualifying score varies from state to state;one-half of one percent of each state's graduating seniors arechosen.   Last year, when the national average for the Class of 1987 was906, boys averaged 935 and girls 878.   The Cambridge, Mass.-based FairTest said the tests' multiplechoice format seems to favor boys because research suggests theyare more adept at guessing, and male characters are featured moreoften in test questions than females, making the questions more``male-oriented.''   FairTest also said SAT scores underpredict women's actual gradesin college.   Fred Moreno, a spokesman for the College Board in New York,which sponsors the PSAT and SAT, said that charge is based on aCollege Board research report which found women did ``a little bitbetter in college'' than predicted by their combined SATs andgrades.   ``But the difference is very, very small,'' said Moreno. Theactual grades of the women studied were four-hundredths of onepoint higher than predicted, he said. ``There's no proof that thetest is biased.''</TEXT></DOC>
