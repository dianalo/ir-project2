MCI's long-distance phone advertising ``has misled customersabout prices, about the quality and reach of its service and aboutits facsimile service,'' Victor Pelson, ATandamp;T group executive, toldreporters in announcing the countersuit.   ``MCI, instead of cleaning up its own advertising act, had thegall to file a lawsuit,'' Pelson said. ``We stand by ouradvertising.''   ATandamp;T's U.S. District Court lawsuit denies the allegations inMCI's Oct. 10 legal complaint and asks the court to enjoin MCI frommaking false or deceptive representations with respect to theprice, quality, features or any other aspect of any MCI service.   It asks the court to order MCI to make court-approved correctiveads ``to mitigate the lingering effects of the misrepresentations.''   ATandamp;T's lawsuit also seeks unspecified profits ``wrongfullyamassed by MCI on the sale of its products or services during theperiod in question,'' plus triple the damages that ATandamp;T hassustained because of the ads and legal and court costs.   ``We are amazed that ATandamp;T should label as absurd MCI's claimthat 100,000 customers a week are switching to it from ATandamp;T, yetfailed to challenge it in court,'' MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegansaid. ``The most significant thing about ATandamp;T's countersuit waswhat was not in it.''   Keegan said MCI planned to seek an injunction against ATandamp;T's adssoon.   The lawsuits are the latest chapters in MCI's long battle withATandamp;T, which began in the 1970s when MCI successfully broke ATandamp;T'slong-distance monopoly.   ATandamp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long-distance market,as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2with more than 10 percent.   MCI's lawsuit claimed ATandamp;T was trying to protect its erodingshare of the long-distance market through maliciously false anddeceptive advertising.   The MCI lawsuit said that beginning in January this year, ATandamp;Tlaunched a counterattack against its competitors to regain marketshare and in July began targeting MCI's new Primetime, cut-ratelong-distance calling plan.   MCI Chairman William McGowan said at the time of the filing thatATandamp;T was losing 100,000 customers a week, and ``they are panickingabout it.''   Pelson said McGowan's claim was ``absurd.''   Merrill Tutton, ATandamp;T vice president consumer services, cited anMCI ad that claims ``MCI always saves you money.''   He said MCI was making ``apples and oranges'' comparisonsbetween its cut-rate calling plans and ATandamp;T's standardlong-distance rates.   ``We want to inform our customers of the facts,'' Tutton said.   He defended an ad that had particularly incensed McGowan _ oneshowing a satellite picture of the earth with a quarter segment ofthe planet missing, including Europe, the Middle East and NorthAfrica. The ad copy says ``Is this how your worldwide long-distancecompany sees the world?''   MCI's lawsuit had asked court to enjoin ATandamp;T from making falseor deceptive representations that any ATandamp;T service is superior orthat MCI has misrepresented its services or rates.</TEXT></DOC>
