The drumbeat of criticism is coming mostly fromconservatives, led by former Pentagon officials Richard Perleand Frank Gaffney, who has an active fax machine andextensive contacts in the press. Some liberals, such asSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), havepicked up some of their points.</LP><TEXT>   But a closer look at the arms and trade moves suggeststhat Mr. Bush didn't give away nearly as much as the attackssuggest, according to analyses not only inside theadministration but by outside analysts. In some cases Sovietbenefits are illusory and in others the U.S. seems to be theclear winner. Accordingly, the political dangers to Mr. Bushmay be considerably less than would be the case if there werea full-scale conservative attack. &quot;In the immediatepost-summit climate, the attacks are meaningless,&quot; says KevinPhillips, a Republican political theorist.   The summit did fail to advance Mr. Bush's keyforeign-policy goals: unifying Germany in the West androlling back Soviet troops in Europe.   But on strategic-arms control, the treaty nearingcompletion will be lopsided in most respects in favor of theU.S. And on Lithuania, Mr. Bush has shifted to a strategy ofusing congressional pressure to force Mr. Gorbachev intoeasing his crackdown before the pact is ratified. Thatensures that months, at least, will pass before real tradebenefits flow to Moscow.   &quot;On START {the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty}, we gotmost of the restrictions we were looking for,&quot; maintainsMichael Mandelbaum, an analyst at the Council on ForeignRelations. And on Lithuania, says Rep. Jim Leach, an IowaRepublican, Congress is &quot;making very clear that the Balticsmatter,&quot; leaving Mr. Bush free to avoid &quot;backing Gorbachevinto a corner from which there is no maneuverability.&quot;   Among those who disagree, the drumbeat of criticism beganthe week before the summit, when Secretary of State JamesBaker went to Moscow to settle key arms-control provisionsthat made up the joint summit statement on strategic weapons.   In the following days, influential conservativecommentators blasted Mr. Baker for caving in to Sovietdemands. Actively pushing the attack is the Center forSecurity Policy, a small think tank run by Mr. Gaffney, aninformed and articulate conservative who was a top Pentagonarms-control official from 1983 to 1987. Mr. Gaffney hasestablished a reputation for quickly providing journalistsand analysts with pointed commentary on foreign-policyissues.   The center's final judgment on the Washington summitaccused Mr. Bush of making &quot;the worst strategicmiscalculation on the part of a president of the UnitedStates since the Yalta conference of 1945,&quot; when FranklinRoosevelt agreed to a Soviet sphere of influence in Europe.   Columnists William Safire and Rowland Evans and RobertNovak, and an editorial in this newspaper, all complained.The conservative Washington Times carried a banner headlinedeclaring: &quot;Baker `sellout' in arms talks feared.&quot; Mr. Perlestrongly sounded the same charges in commentaries before,during and after the summit.   Some lawmakers echo the complaints about Lithuania, withSenate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas warning afterthe summit that &quot;if the Lithuania or the Baltic problem isn'tresolved, then I think it will become a matter of greatconcern.&quot;   In an interview, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) concedescongressional conservatives haven't raised much of a ruckusso far about the arms-control deals. But he called the recentarms concessions &quot;a serious error that will tie us down onmilitary technology.&quot; He said &quot;it's arms control as apolitical process, not a strategic process,&quot; adding that &quot;theadministration has decided that there is but one overridingU.S. national interest, and that is Gorbachev's survival.They're willing to subordinate all other goals to that.&quot;   On arms control, the critics have many gripes but havezeroed in on two key issues: long-range cruise missiles,where the U.S. has an edge; and &quot;heavy&quot; multiple-warhead,land-based, ballistic missiles, where Moscow has a monopoly.   The critics charge that, by agreeing to an upper limit of880 sea-launched cruise missiles, Mr. Bush wrote off a majorU.S. advantage, and tempted Congress to cut the programs.   But the deal worked out by Mr. Baker in Moscow, andsanctioned at the summit, actually meets an American demandthat sea-launched cruise missiles be excluded altogether fromthe legally binding treaty limits and verificationprocedures. Instead, they are to be covered only by&quot;politically binding declarations&quot; in which each side willmerely state how many it will build. In return, Mr. Baker --with Pentagon and White House concurrence -- agreed that theU.S. wouldn't declare an intention to build more than 880 ofthe weapons, well above the total of 758 the Navy says itneeds.   On air-launched cruise missiles, fired from the wings ofbombers, the critics lambaste the administration for agreeingto count all such weapons with a range of more than 600kilometers and for making promises about a new conventionalcruise missile code-named &quot;Tacit Rainbow.&quot;   But the U.S. actually won the right to exclude as many as1,500 of the weapons from treaty limits vs. 840 for theU.S.S.R. And Mr. Baker managed to exempt the exotic &quot;TacitRainbow&quot; missile merely by stating that the Air Force onlyplans a nonnuclear version.   On heavy missiles, the critics complain that the U.S. hasagreed that some modernization of the Soviets' huge SS-18will be permitted. They contend that by upgrading the SS-18s,Moscow could fully offset cuts in the number of missiles.   But the treaty as it stands would slash the SS-18 force inhalf, from 308 missiles to 154. And no amount of improvementis likely to offset that cut, according to former defensesecretary Harold Brown, because nuclear-war plannersgenerally seek to aim two warheads at each target. Further,the U.S. is still pressing to effectively cut off furtherSS-18 modernization after 1992.   Overall, experts estimate that the treaty will widen theU.S. lead in nuclear warheads and deprive Moscow of itshistoric edge in ballistic missiles.   On the trade issue, there isn't any doubt that Mr. Bushgave Mr. Gorbachev a symbolic political prize by signing thetrade pact while the Kremlin is still squeezing Lithuania.But in more substantive terms, Mr. Bush has made it clear tothe Soviets that he won't send the trade deal to Congress forapproval, and won't take the related step of granting theSoviets most-favored-nation trade status, until the Sovietlegislature passes a new law guaranteeing Soviet Jewsexpanded rights to emigrate.   Beyond that, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker drove home to theSoviets the need to keep the trade pact from becomingentangled in a fight with Congress over Lithuania. To makethe point, Mr. Bush used a congressional action he initiallydidn't like: a May 1 Senate resolution declaring that thepresident shouldn't even bother sending Congress a new tradedeal for approval until the Kremlin's economic crackdown onLithuania is eased.   As a result, both U.S. and Soviet officials suddenly findit convenient to put off implementing the trade pact. Sovietofficials now are hinting that passage of their newemigration law, the next step in the process, won't occuruntil at least September. In the meantime, U.S. officialshope that, by dangling a signed but unactivated trade treatybefore Mr. Gorbachev's eyes, they are giving a positiveincentive to get moving by then on Lithuania.   By giving Congress the bad-cop role, Mr. Bush has letothers tie trade to the Baltics while avoiding formal linkagethat might rear its head again and again as ethnic issuesboil up in the future. Some think that's useful in the longrun. &quot;I think we ought to think twice before we tie oureconomic relationship to the Soviet Union to the satisfactionof each and every grievance&quot; by ethnic groups, says Mr.Mandelbaum.   ---                      ADVANTAGE: U.S.                                                                                                          Under the likely terms of the Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty currently being negotiated, the Soviet warhead totalis estimated to fall about twice as much as the U.S. total bythe late 1960s.
