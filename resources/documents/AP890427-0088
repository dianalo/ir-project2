President Reagan was able to weather the crises of his tenurebecause of his personal popularity. ``Reagan became adored by thepublic because the White House manipulated very brilliantly'' themedia with staged events and photo opportunities, she said.   President Bush has not done that, she said, adding, ``I kind ofrespect it, but it's not doing him any good.''   Other panelists said, however, that media manipulation isworthless if the president or candidate has nothing substantive tosay.   ``That is equally as important in politics if not moreimportant,'' said David Gergen, an editor at U.S. News and WorldReport. ``Jesse Jackson does not attract followers because he's gotmedia people. He's got something to say.''   The point was echoed at an earlier seminar Wednesday on thepresidential selection process.   ``Every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of thedebate, whether it's Jesse Jackson and his `working poor' litany orGeorge Bush's acceptance speech (at the Republican convention), youcan feel the public almost come alive, say, `More, please give usmore,''' said Jeff Greenfield, political and media adviser for ABCNews.   Greenfield also defended political advertising as admittedly ``ashort and clumsy way to get to know a candidate. Yet even withinthose limits, you pick up something.''   Roger Ailes, Bush's media adviser, defended the advertising hecrafted for Bush last year against charges that it was too negativeor unfair.   ``Look at `trash TV,' look at the lines blurring between tabloidjournalism and journalism, look at the garbage that is out there ingeneral,'' Ailes said. ``I would submit that the politicalcampaigns are among the cleanest things on television today.''   But NBC News commentator John Chancellor, who moderated theseminar, said that since presidential candidates are spendingpublic money _ about $41 million each in 1988 _ ``we ought to havesome say in how they spend it.''   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on presidential politics fromthe University of Texas at Austin, suggested a nonpartisan panel beinstituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairnessand accuracy.   Negative campaigning was one of the factors that turn people offand keep them away from the polls on Election Day, said Ron Brown,chairman of the Democratic National Committee.   But Greenfield said he believed the role of television wasexaggerated. ``You run the 1988 campaign with 10 percentunemployment and you have a very different result,'' he said.   The five seminars Wednesday and today at Fordham were organizedas part of New York City's commemoration of the bicentennial ofGeorge Washington's presidential inauguration.</TEXT></DOC>
