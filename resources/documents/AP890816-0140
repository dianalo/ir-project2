Organizers include Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner ofthe 1984 Nobel Peace Prize; Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the blackminers' union, and Albertina Sisulu, co-president of the bannedUnited Democratic Front coalition.   In Durban, the family of an anti-apartheid youth leader releasedlast week said he was shot dead outside his home. Eric Gumede, 27,was freed after a prolonged hunger strike in protest of being jailedwithout charges.   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said in Lusaka that blackAfrican nations might help arrange peace talks between SouthAfrica's white authorities and the African National Congressguerrilla group if the process of Namibian independence goessmoothly.   White South African business leaders, back from a three-day tripto Zambia, said they tried unsuccessfully to persuade the ANC, whichhas its headquarters in Lusaka, to abandon violence.   Organizers of the unity conference said its aim was ``to map outthe most effective, shortest path to the ending of oppression andexploitation, and the creation of a democratic country.''   ``We expect the conference to be attended by thousands ofdelegates from all walks of life, representing millions of people,''they said in a statement.   Last year, South Africa's white authorities banned a similarconference.   The organizers, predicting another ban, said: ``We are alertingthe international community to monitor the actions of the regime inrelation to this gathering of the people.''   Officials of the United States, Soviet Union, Western Europe andsouthern African nations have been briefed about the conference,they said, and ``the current mood of our people is such that webelieve they will defy any attempt by the state to prevent theconference from going ahead.''   A nationwide defiance campaign now under way in South Africa ischallenging various racial laws.   Gumede was a leader of the KwaMashu Youth League, a UnitedDemocratic Front affiliate based in one of Durban's largest blacktownships.   His brother Popo said a car drove up to their home soon aftermidnight and someone in it honked the horn. Eric went outside andwas shot in the chest by two blasts from a shotgun, Popo said.   Kaunda, current chairman of the black ``Frontline States''adjoining South Africa, said:   ``We are watching South Africa very carefully on the question ofNamibia. If it fares well we are willing and ready to give SouthAfrica the benefit of the doubt. We might begin to ... bring SouthAfrica and the ANC together. The path is well marked out how we aregoing to do this.''   South Africa has agreed to independence for Namibia, also knownas South-West Africa, after U.N.-supervised elections in November.   Sid Matus, president of the Association of Chambers of Commerceand Industry, South Africa's largest business organization, visitedZambia with two colleagues.   They said before the trip they would confer with Kaunda andmembers of his government about political and economic developmentsin southern Africa, but told reporters Wednesday they also held``wide-ranging discussions'' with members of the African NationalCongress executive committee.   ``They said they couldn't denounce violence because then therewould be nothing to fight this country with,'' Matus said. ``Webegged them to compromise their stance on violence, but to noavail.''</TEXT></DOC>
