Hynek, Inc.; Dallas, TX; Negative Determination RegardingApplication for Reconsideration</ITAG>By an application dated January 22, 1989, the company requested administraivereconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance.The denial notice was signed on January 12, 1989 and will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>soon.Pusuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the followingcircumstances:(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered thatthe determination complained of was erroneous;(2) It it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistakein the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) If, in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a mistake interpretationof facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision.The company states that it composes and provides crude oil and naturalgas prospects to attract potential investors for unaffiliated firms inthe oil and gas industry. The company claims that oil and gas prospectsare a visible and tangible product.The Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performanceof services does not constitute the production of an article as requiredby section 222 of of the Trade Act of 1974. The 1988 amendments to theTrade Act, in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, extended coverageto workers in indpendent firms in the oil and gas industry engaged in explorationor drilling. The amended Act provides that independent firms engaged inexploration or drilling shall be considered to be producing oil and naturalgas. Services involving the development of oil and gas prospects are notdirectly related to exploration or drilling, as provided for in section222 (b)(2)(A) of the Act, and therefore are not covered under Act.Further, in its initial determination, the Department addressed at lengththe manner in which workers of firms providing services could be certifiedfor adjustment assistance. Those conditions have not been met.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After review of the application and investigative findings, I concludethat there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of thefacts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor'sprior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC. this 22nd day of February 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert O.
