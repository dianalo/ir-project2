<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-16-0833 </DOCNO><TEXT>A set of inequalities is given as a formal definition of what we understandto be microheterogeneity. At the same time some known theoretical andexperimental facts are mentioned representing already verifications ofthe criteria given. Experimental results for the /sup 87/Rb, /sup 133/Cs,and /sup 81/Br nuclear magnetic relaxation rates in the respective aqueoushalide solutions as a function of concentration and temperature are reported.These data are partly interpreted in terms of higher ion-ion correlations,and partly a reduction of the first hydration number of the cations yieldsthe explanation. The association parameter A is used to detect a feebledegree of water-water association in the RbX and CsX solutions, X = Cl,Br, I. We conclude that we have evidence for microheterogeneity.</TEXT></DOC>
