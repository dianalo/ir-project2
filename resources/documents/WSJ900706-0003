The economic summit will pit the U.S. against the Europeancountries on each of these major issues. For Mr. Bush, thehost of the summit, it will be difficult to emerge unbruised.</LP><TEXT>   On agriculture, the U.S. wants to use the summit to pushfor an agreement with its allies to eliminate most farmsubsidies, an issue it feels is crucial to breaking thedeadlock in the current round of international trade talks.But on that score, it faces heavy resistance from France,Italy, West Germany and Britain.   On Soviet aid, it's the West Germans and the French whoare eager to use the summit to push for immediate action. TheU.S. urges waiting for more Soviet commitment tomarket-oriented economic reform before shelling out moneythat the U.S. fears would be wasted.   And on the environment, the Europeans, led by the WestGermans, want to agree on steps to cut back &quot;greenhouse&quot;gases, which many scientists fear will raise the Earth'stemperature by trapping too much heat from the sun and causepossibly dramatic climate changes. The most troublinggreenhouse gases are the result of burning fossil fuels likecoal and oil, and steps to curb these emissions would havebig economic impacts. But the Bush administration isn'tconvinced by the European arguments and stresses the need formore research as well as proven environmental measures likeenergy conservation and tree-planting.   The likely outcome: a summit of heavy quarreling and hardbargaining between the U.S. and Europe on issues that arecrucial to the future world order. The two other summitcountries -- Canada and Japan -- generally lean toward theU.S. position on the major issues, with Canada beingparticularly supportive on the need for far-reachingagricultural reform.   Yet, however bad the tiffs between the summit countries onthese major issues, it's likely they'll all sign off on afinal communique that carefully papers over their differenceson these and other subjects.   &quot;Any summit is a snapshot of international negotiations inthe economic and political world in that year, and this yearthere are three or four processes that are in a criticalstage,&quot; Richard McCormack, undersecretary for economic andagricultural affairs at the State Department, said in aninterview. Progress on these issues at this summit willrequire tough talking between the leaders themselves.   &quot;This isn't a technicians' summit, but a summit ofpolitical leaders&quot; said Mr. McCormack, who is PresidentBush's sherpa -- as guides to Himalayan summits are known --for the second year.   The Houston summit will be a sharp contrast to last year'scelebration in Paris, which coincided with the bicentenary ofthe French Revolution, when the leaders had so little left todiscuss that they even canceled their final dinner and wenttheir separate ways half a day early.   The agriculture issue is particularly important becauselack of agreement threatens to undermine the current UruguayRound of talks under the world's trade treaty, the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those talks, begun in 1986 inPunta del Este in Uruguay, aim to rewrite the world's traderules, extending them to cover practically all of the globe'scommerce. They are scheduled to conclude in December inBrussels.   The U.S. is adamant about the need for reform inagriculture. &quot;Trying to get agreement on going forwardfruitfully on the Uruguay Round would be very important to meand all of us here,&quot; President Bush told reporters recently,&quot;and I'd put that at the top&quot; of the Houston agenda, headded.   Earlier this week, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hillssaid the U.S. most wants &quot;a recognition by Europeanparticipants that agriculture is key to the round.&quot; She alsonoted that the spat over agriculture pits the EuropeanCommunity against practically all the world's otherfood-exporting nations.   Without progress on agricultural reform, the U.S. fearsthat many developing countries will desert the GATT talks andthat there will be a breakdown of the freetrading systemleading to &quot;more unilateralism, and a couple of years of realexcitement&quot; before negotiations could begin anew, Mr.McCormack said.   But the Europeans remain leery of any reforms inagriculture that will cut into their $9 billion a year ofexport subsidies, or into the billions of dollars they spendon price supports. The former are particularly helpful to thebig exports of France's relatively efficient farmers, whilethe latter help to protect West Germany's relativelyinefficient agriculture.   A senior European Commission official told reportersyesterday that the Europeans wouldn't bring to Houston newinitiatives on farm subsidies but would continue to push fora recognition that &quot;our agricultural systems are different.&quot;He said EC President Jacques Delors would seek to impress onPresident Bush that the EC can't eliminate its subsidies asthe U.S. would like it to.   The crumbling Soviet economy also is dividing the allies.West Germany, eager for Soviet endorsement of its plannedunion with East Germany, recently lent Moscow five billionmarks ($3.03 billion), and is canvassing for more Westernaid. France also is keen to help the Soviets. But the U.S.,Canada, Japan and Britain remain opposed. &quot;None of ourbilateral issues are solved,&quot; says a Japanese governmentofficial discussing his country's relations with the SovietUnion.   Moreover, the European Community itself hasn't yet puttogether a Soviet-aid plan. At its recent summit in Dublin,the EC agreed to study the issue and come up with a proposalby October.   The U.S. and the Europeans, along with other developednations, already are moving together to deal with oneworld-wide environmental problem: the depletion of theEarth's protective ozone layer, which shields out the sun'sharmful ultraviolet rays.   But greenhouse gases and threats of global warming pose astickier issue that still is likely to cloud the summitatmosphere. The U.S. is spending massive amounts of money onresearching the global-warming issue and wants to wait untilit gets what it considers conclusive results.   On all three key issues -- agricultural trade, Soviet aidand the environment -- West Germany, Europe's emergingsuperpower, is unlikely to want to offend Mr. Bush. &quot;Youshouldn't forget that German unification is Chancellor Kohl'stop priority, and we have been very supportive of him,&quot; saysa senior U.S. administration official, discussing the Houstonsummit.   And Mr. Bush himself appreciates the variety of opinionsin the group. &quot;Nobody says we've got to move in lockstep onall of this,&quot; he told reporters recently. &quot;I have greatrespect for Kohl, and great respect for Mrs. Thatcher'sapproach, and Mitterrand's approach, all of them. I thinkthere are nuances of difference there. But that doesn'tweaken the prospects for the economic summit. Those aren'tdividing issues that are going to render us asunder from theBrits, or the French, or the Canadians, who look at some ofthese issues a little differently.&quot;   ---         Leaders Who'll Confer at Economic Summit                                                                                                          George Bush                        U.S.A.
