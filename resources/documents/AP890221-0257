(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new method of wresting radioactiveuranium from nature's grasp is ready for commercial use, and couldput the United States at the forefront of the $2 billion enrichmentindustry, a scientist says.   ``I can get real excited about the economic incentives,'' saidRobert Merriman, an associate director of Oak Ridge NationalLaboratory and program manager for development of Atomic Vapor LaserIsotope Separation. ``But I have to confess I believe the principalreasons we want to be in the business in the long term are ourenergy security and our national security. We cannot becomedependent on foreign suppliers for yet another one of our fuels.''   Uranium-235, the form needed for bombs and nuclear reactors,comprises only about 0.7 percent of the metal in nature. To beuseful, that concentration must be increased to 3 percent to 4percent, resulting in ``enriched'' uranium.   The United States still uses gaseous barrier diffusion, developedduring World War II and since refined, to enrich uranium. Theuranium is converted to a gas and pumped repeatedly through a seriesof ceramic filters; because U-235 is lighter than the most commonisotope, U-238, it passes through.   But gaseous barrier diffusion _ done in the United States atplants in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky., is costly. ``I believethe technology in our gaseous diffusion plants is the best in theworld. But Mother Nature just dictated a lot of kilowatt hours forthat approach,'' Merriman said.   Eighty percent of the cost of gaseous barrier diffusion is theelectricity, he said. ``Our expectation is that over the next decadeenergy prices will drive our cost up to the point where our pricesare not competitive.''   The Portsmouth plant also is awaiting cleanup of tons ofradioactive waste.   AVLIS, chosen in 1985 as the preferred U.S. method, makes use ofthe fact that the different electron energies of U-235 and U-238absorb different colors of light. Lasers are tuned so they emit acombination of colors absorbed only by U-235 atoms, which then emitan electron, leaving the atom positively charged and capable ofseparation using electromagnetic fields.   This process, according to the Department of Energy, is vastlymore efficient than gaseous barrier diffusion or a third techniqueusing centrifuges to spin off the lighter U-235. The centrifugeprocess uses less electricity but lost out to AVLIS for governmentsponsorship in this country.   The United States' two main competitors for the nuclear fuelmarket are URENCO, a consortium of Britain, the Netherlands and WestGermany that uses the centrifuge process, and a consortium of Spain,Belgium, France and Italy that uses a French diffusion plant with anuclear power plant dedicated to it.   Merriman said he is confident AVLIS has matured to the point ofcommercial deployment. And maybe just in time.   Duke Power is studying a venture with URENCO to build a uraniumenrichment plant in the United States using European technology.   ``AVLIS has all the attributes of the kind of technology thecountry is looking for,'' Merriman said. ``It uses about 10 percentof the electricity of gaseous diffusion. It's very compact. And it'sa high-tech endeavor.''   The components of AVLIS have demonstrated they would work on acommercial scale, he said. ``It's now a question of getting theengineering done to make it work cheaply, so we can compete andbuild a plant. I don't have any doubt we'll get there.''   The goal is to operate an AVLIS plant to enrich uranium at halfthe cost of current technology. Merriman estimates a commercialAVLIS plant with an output equivalent to that of the Paducah gaseousdiffusion plant would cost about $1.5 billion to $2 billion and takeeight or nine years to build. It could be built in modules andphased in as market conditions dictate, he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Feb. 23</NOTE></DOC>
