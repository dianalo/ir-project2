Sales rose 42%, to $2.47 billion from $1.74 billion. The profit decline was due in part to large nonrecurring costs and heavy capital investments in connection with acquisitions completed last year of Italy's Industrie Zanussi S.p.A. and U.S.-based White Consolidated Industries Inc. In addition, the falling dollar eroded earnings from U.S. units.    In a preliminary report for 1986, Electrolux said profit before taxes for the full year was $396.8 million, unchanged from the previous year. Sales increased 34%, to $8.17 billion from $6.11 billion.    The addition of White to consolidated Electrolux group accounts from April 1, and Zanussi from Sept. 1, accounted for most of the sales gains, Electrolux said.    &quot;In light of favorable expectations,&quot; Electrolux directors proposed to raise the company's dividend to $1.35 a share from $1.16 last year. The increase is subject to approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting scheduled for May 21. </TEXT></DOC>
