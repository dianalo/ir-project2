Dr. Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser was immediately hauled into court,then released on $260 bail.   He and 19 other defendants are alleged to belong to a groupcalled Egypt's Revolution. Prosecutors allege the group launchedattacks from 1984 to 1987 in which two Israeli diplomats were killedand six wounded. Two U.S. diplomats also suffered minor injuries.   Among the defendants is President Nasser's eldest son, Khaled,who remains a fugitive in Yugoslavia. He is one of the primedefendants and could face a death sentence if convicted of thecharges against him.   Gamal Nasser, a physician accused of failing to report a gunshotwound inflicted on an attacker by one of the American victims,pleaded innocent. The trial adjourned until Jan. 24.   The late president's nephew was arrested at Cairo InternationalAirport after he stepped off a flight from London, ending a 14-monthabsence.   He and Khaled Abdel Nasser were outside Egypt when the indictmentwas issued last February against the 20 defendants.   The indictment charged Khaled Abdel Nasser and 10 co-defendantswith murder, undermining Egypt's security and damaging its relationswith Israel and the United States. It demanded they be condemned todeath.   The remaining nine defendants, including Gamal Nasser, werecharged with complicity of various kinds and could be sentenced onconviction to prison terms of up to 25 years.   The trial began in November.   Tuesday's hearing was mainly procedural, with the lawyersdemanding an end to solitary confinement imposed on the 11defendants facing possible death sentences.</TEXT></DOC>
