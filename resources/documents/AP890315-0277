The eight U.S.-based vehicle manufacturers reported Tuesday thatvehicles sales averaged 33,838 a day during the March 1-10 period,compared with a daily rate of 36,330 for the same time last year.   Car sales took the largest hit, dropping 18.5 percent, whilesales of light trucks fell 8 percent, the companies said.   ``I look at consumer psychology, and you have to believe thatinterest rates are beginning to dampen it,'' said analyst Mary AnneSudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York. ``That has to cutinto the family's disposable income and maybe they're thinking maybelet the old buggy do longer. I think consumers are very edgy.''   The prime lending rate _ what banks charge their mostcreditworthy customers _ has risen 1 percentage point in the pastmonth to 11.5 percent.   Analysts and auto industry insiders expected the early Marchsales rate to be below that of last year, when incentives weredrawing consumers to showrooms like magnets. Incentives were offeredduring the period this year, but haven't had the draw of last year.   ``People have become jaded about them,'' Sudol said. ``I hadn'tlooked for anything robust.''   Each of the Big Three automakers showed double-digit declines incar sales during early March, with Chrysler Corp.'s figures dropping35.9 percent, Ford Motor Co.'s sales slumping 21.4 percent andGeneral Motors Corp.'s sales running 13.4 percent behind last year'space.   Automakers will be closely watching the traditionally good earlyspring buying, especially during the next two months.   ``It's the classic warmup for the summer driving season,'' Sudolsaid. ``Everybody comes out of hibernation.''   Traditionally, March and April sales have reduced automakers'inventories, which are hovering around the 80-day level.   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, the combined inventoryamong the U.S.-based automakers is at its highest level in 19 months.   Each of the Big Three recently boosted incentive offers in aneffort to stoke the sales fire, and GM temporarily halted productionat two plants to reduce inventory.   For the year, car and light truck sales by U.S.-based makers wererunning 6.9 percent behind last year's pace, falling to a daily rateof 33,838 vehicles so far this year from a rate of 36,330 last year.A 9.7 percent decline in car sales was offset by a 1.7 percent dropin truck sales.   Chrysler's car sales were down 21.4 percent on a year-to-yearcomparison. Chrysler's light trucks sales were 8.5 percent lower forthe early March period and up 3.5 percent for the year.   For the year, Ford's car sales were 3.3 percent lower than lastyear's rate. The nation's No. 2 vehicle maker said its truck saleswere down 20.6 percent in early March compared with the same periodlast year, and were off 3.5 percent for the year.   GM's car sales for the year ran 14.4 percent behind last year'space. Light truck sales by GM were up 5.6 percent during the earlypart of the month, and for the year, GM's trucks are selling at arate 5.8 percent behind last year's.</TEXT></DOC>
