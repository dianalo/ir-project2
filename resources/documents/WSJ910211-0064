For the first time in the current cycle, a significantnumber of banks -- nearly one in five -- said they were&quot;somewhat less willing&quot; to make auto, home-equity and otherconsumer loans. In earlier Fed surveys, hardly any banksreported such policies.</LP><TEXT>   Nearly one-third of the banks -- and nearly 40% of the bigbanks surveyed -- also said they have tightened standards forhome mortgages over the past three months, most often byrequiring larger down payments.   For the past year, bankers' reluctance to lend has beenretarding the growth of the economy, contributing to therecession and frustrating the Fed's efforts to resuscitatethe economy.   About one-third of the banks surveyed -- and 90% of theforeign banks -- told the Fed that since October they havetightened credit standards for business loans made forpurposes other than mergers or real estate. Not one bank saidit was making loans easier to get.   In about the only hopeful sign, the Fed said, fewer U.S.banks reported in January than in October that they werestill tightening lending standards. At foreign banks doingbusiness in the U.S., however, &quot;the pace of tighteningappears to have accelerated,&quot; a Fed staff report on thesurvey said.   Banks responding to the survey account for about one-thirdof all assets held by domestic banks and about one-fourth ofthe U.S. assets of foreign banks.   The real estate business was among the first to feel thepinch, and banks continue to toughen criteria for making realestate loans. Nearly half of domestic banks surveyed saidthey tightened standards for making construction andland-development loans over the past three months.   Although the Fed has been pushing interest rates downsince the end of October, it found that many large banks havebeen raising the cost of business credit. More than half thebanks said they have increased the cost of credit lines andof loans taken under such credit lines for large andmedium-sized businesses. Almost 60% of the banks reported awidening spread between the rates they charge businesses andtheir prime or other base rates.   Separately, the Fed disclosed that its policy-setting OpenMarket Committee's vote was unanimous when it agreed at itsDec. 18 meeting to ease credit immediately and to lean towardfurther easing in the subsequent weeks. Even policy makerswho objected to some earlier Fed easing moves, such as LeeHoskins of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, agreed thatthe December move was warranted in view of the recession andthe sluggish growth of the money supply.   The summary of the meeting, released Friday, said most ofthe policy makers expected &quot;a relatively mild and shortrecession&quot; but &quot;emphasized the risks of a more severe andprolonged contraction.&quot;   Since the December meeting, the Fed has cut its discountrate, the rate it charges banks for loans, by a fullpercentage point to 6%. It also has reduced its target forthe federal funds rate, which banks charge each other forovernight loans, by three-quarters of a percentage point.   The Open Market Committee -- the six current Fed governorsand five of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents -- met againlast week. The Fed hasn't given any signal in financialmarkets that it is making another easing move.</TEXT></DOC>
