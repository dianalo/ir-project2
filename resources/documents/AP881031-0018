Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., who iscoordinating the multistate investigation, also said indictmentscould continue for a year as a result of a probe into the$150-billion-a-year Defense Department purchasing system.   A federal grand jury resumes meeting Nov. 15, so indictmentscould come then, which would be about five months after the FBIrevealed the investigation by searching more than 40 premisesacross the country.   ``I am very optimistic on November indictments,'' Hudson said.Information about the case has been scarce because prosecutors havesealed most search warrants and affidavits.   The investigation centers on whether private consultants, manyof them former Pentagon employees, paid bribes to DefenseDepartment officials for inside information about contracts,chiefly within the Navy.   Hudson, a Republican, denied any suggestion that indictmentswere slowed so that Democratic presidential candidate MichaelDukakis could not make them an issue in his campaign against VicePresident George Bush.   ``Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand downindictments in the first part of October,'' Hudson said in aninterview.   But the prosecutor said the case has been ``administrativelycomplex'' with attorneys forced to examine about 700,000 documentsand listen to ``thousands and thousands of tapes of two years oftelephone interceptions.''   Federal and defense sources also indicate Hudson's staff hasbeen kept waiting for answers from some potential defendants whohave been offered plea bargains.   Adding to the task was the time-consuming process of gatheringfinancial evidence from foreign bank accounts, which Hudsondescribed as an ``always delicate issue.''   Hudson said there were good reasons for thoroughness, includingthe ``high national visibility'' of the case, and the propensityfor judges in Virginia to schedule trials shortly after indictmentsare returned.   ``I will not present this indictment until we are ready fortrial, and we feel we will be ready ... within the next month,'' hesaid. As the case evolves, indictments and trials could be held inother cities, sources said.   Hudson did not discuss charges that could be filed. But the useof Internal Revenue Service agents on the case suggests that taxcharges may be contemplated in addition to the more obvious countsof theft of government property, bribery, fraud and conspiracy todefraud the government.   Fifteen attorneys, some of them working 12-hour days andweekends, plus 75 federal agents from the FBI, the NavalInvestigative Service and the IRS have been assigned to the case,which Hudson called, ``the largest case ever handled in the easterndistrict of Virginia.''   Hudson refused to say how many indictments he expected to bereturned initially, but noted that courtroom space generallyconfines the number to less than 12.   Though Hudson declined to name the targets of the investigation,he did not rule out members of Congress.   ``All individuals that may have been engaged in wrongdoing orcommitted a criminal act in connection with the defense procurementprocess will be scrutinized and prosecuted if appropriate,'' hesaid.   Hudson disputed reports that he had told members of Congressduring the summer that none was a target. ``I never made such astatement,'' he said.   ``I told the members of the House of Representatives that nomember of Congress had been the subject of electronic surveillance,had received a subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury atthat time or had been the subject of a search warrant,'' he said.   Court papers filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., indicate prosecutors arelooking at allegations that campaign contributions were extorted.   Raids in New York came at the business of James Kane, who set upthe Long Island Aerospace Political Action Committee to makecontributions that might help area defense contractors, and at thehome of Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys Corp. official identified asturning over contributions to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., who sits onthe House Armed Services Committee. Dyson has denied any wrongdoing.   The name of another committee member, Rep. Bill Chappell Jr.,has also surfaced in connection with the probe. Chappell says hehas done nothing wrong.   Among those whose names have been linked to the investigationare five Pentagon officials, including James Gaines, deputyassistant Navy secretary for acquisition and management; MelvynPaisley, a consultant who was assistant secretary of the Navy forresearch, engineering and systems before leaving government in1987, and William Galvin, another defense consultant.</TEXT></DOC>
