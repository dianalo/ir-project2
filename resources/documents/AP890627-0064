Takes,440-up</SECOND><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here is the text of President Bush's newsconference Tuesday.   I have a brief opening statement, and then I'd be glad to takequestions. On Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court issued a decisionwhich held that a person could not be convicted for desecration ofour flag, the American flag, and because to do so would infringeupon the right to political protest. Now, we've got to be verycareful in our society to preserve the right to protest governmentaction. However, I believe that the flag of the United States shouldnever be the object of desecration.   Flag-burning is wrong. Protection of the flag, a unique nationalsymbol, will in no way limit the opportunity nor the breadth ofprotest available in the exercise of free speech rights. And I havethe greatest respect for the Supreme Court, and indeed for thejustices who interpreted the Constitution as they saw fit. But Ibelieve the importance of this issue compels me to call for aconstitutional amendment.   Support for the First Amendment need not extend to desecration ofthe American flag. And we are reviewing proposed language for aconstitutional amendment. We are beginning consultation with membersof the United States Congress who hold similar views. And aspresident, I will uphold our precious right to dissent, but burningthe flag goes too far, and I want to see that matter remedied.   Tom?   Q. Mr. President, when you were last with us, you said that youhad tried to contact the leaders of China, and the line was busy;you were unable to get through. In light of the fact that there isnow a new party secretary, have you renewed that try? And also, inlight of what you just said, have you planned to ask Prime MinisterLi Peng to return the Texas cowboy boots with the American flag onit that you gave him in China?   A. I have no such plans. But _ and I hope he doesn't ask for hisbicycles back either. But in terms of contacts, we are trying,through our embassy, to have contacts. We have contact _ theirambassador has access to and contact with our officials here. And sothere has been some exchange of views. But I have not, you know,renewed a phone call request, if that was your question.   Q. As a follow-up, Mr. President, do you intend to go ahead andsend a Peace Corps team to China in the fall to teach English, orwill you go along with the Chinese request that that be delayed?</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
