Early work on this topic concentrated on a deductive approach,but it has lately been realised that abductive inference has many advantages.Here we define the concept of &quot;cause&quot; for an observation and the propertiesbasicness, minimality, nontriviality and acceptability which characteriseuseful causes. A procedural is presented for computing from an observationcauses with these properties. The application of this method to the diagnosisproblem is then illustrated by applying it to a series of examples inwhich faulty components are diagnosed from aberrent behaviour of gatenetworks. The authors compare their procedure to Reiter's method forgenerating diagnoses, and show that for strict diagnosis problems itproduces equivalent results, but for extended problems in which somegate inputs or the identities of some gates are unknown, our causes containmore useful information then Reiter's diagnoses. Finally they discusssome practical issues and further research topics concerning the computationof causes.</TEXT></DOC>
