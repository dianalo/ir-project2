(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>36andM;Digital Research Inc. (DRI) traveled a rocky road on its way to creating asuccessful DOS clone.andP;  Its first efforts produced a weird amalgam of CP/M-86and DOS emulation that found little acceptance in the DOS world.andP;  Morerecently, DRI honed in on true compatibility with the DOS standard andenjoyed significant success penetrating the market for ROMable DOS.andP;  DigitalResearch's latest and finest product, the $199 DR DOS 5.0, confrontsMicrosoft on its own ground.andM;DR DOS 5.0 is an almost-perfect superset of MS-DOS 3.3 and 4.0.andP;  In thecourse of a normal day's work you probably wouldn't notice any differencebetween how you'd interact with MS-DOS or DR DOS.andP;  I found no compatibilityproblems with a broad selection of applications including several wordprocessors, programming tools, debuggers, TSRS, DOS extender applications,3Com network software, the various Norton Utilities, and (to my surprise)Windows 3.0.andM;Beyond that, DR DOS 5.0 leapfrogs MS-DOS 3.3 and 4.0 in some important ways.andO;It provides a disk cache that can use either extended or expanded memory.andP;  Ithas a FILELINK utility that can ship itself over a serial communications linkto a second computer and then transfer files in either direction.andP;  It allowsthe display of prompts, keyboard entries, and the conditional execution ofCONFIG.SYS directives at system boot time.andP;  And it contains featuresespecially for laptops, including a command to set the size and blink rate ofthe cursor, and the ability to minimize battery drain by monitoring andpowering down peripherals.andM;DR DOS's SETUP program is far superior to anything that has ever beensupplied with MS-DOS, even better in several respects than that of the widelyacclaimed Windows 3.0.andP;  It's a full-screen, interactive, menu-driven programthat is fast, visually attractive, and forgiving of errors; it almostcompletely insulates the novice from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC .BAT arcana.andM;When DR DOS is installed over&quot; a previous version of MS- or DR DOS, it seeksand replaces all of the DOS utility programs, wherever they might reside onthe fixed disk.andP;  Best of all, SETUP copies itself to the DR DOS directoryduring installation, so that it can be reinvoked at any later time toreconfigure the system.andM;The command line interface has been extended.andP;  Every command has on-linehelp, which is requested by entering the command's name followed by a /Hswitch.andP;  New utilities such as PASSWORD (which provides file and directoryprotection), TOUCH (which modifies a file's time and date stamps), XDEL(which can recursively delete subdirectories and their files, or overwrite afile before erasing it so that it cannot beandM;unerased&quot;), and XDIR (which produces directory listings sorted by file name,date and time, or size, and can also include or exclude files by theirattributes) all fill gaps in the MS-DOS command set.andP;  EDLIN (may it rest inpeace) is replaced by a compact, speedy visual editor.andP;  Lastly, DR DOSsupports a command line &quot;history &quot; facility that buffers all recently enteredcommand lines so that they can be recalled, edited, and reissued.andM;The efficient use of memory is equally impressive.andP;  When available, most ofthe DR DOS kernel can be relocated into the high memory area (HMA),increasing the amount of memory available for applications below the 640Kboundary.andP;  On 80286 machines based on the NEAT or LEAP chipsets, or on 80386or 80486 machines, DR DOS can also remap extended memory into the &quot;holes&quot;between 640K and 1MB, allowing device drivers and TSRs (as well as the DR DOSkernel) to be loaded above the 640K limit.andP;  In addition, VCPI-compatible EMS4.0 emulation is supported on 80386-or 80486-based PCs.andP;  Taking fulladvantage of these capabilities requires some experimentation, but it'sworthwhile-when I finished, a CHKDSK under DR DOS 5.0 running on my Dell316SX showed 587K of conventional memory available, as opposed to 462K underMS-DOS 3.3.andM;DRI especially caters to OEMs, systems integrators, and embedded systemsdevelopers who want to customize and/or resell DR DOS.andP;  A $300, SystemBuilder Kit (SBK) includes source code for the basic device drivers, anIBM-compatible ROM BIOS, a skeletal ROM BIOS for noncompatible systems, and asample battery-saving and power-control module.andP;  This kit can be used tobuild a new DR DOS system to execute from disk, ROM, EPROM, or Intel's newFLASH memory.andM;The only component of DR DOS that I didn't particularly care for was itsshell, VIEWMAX.andP;  Though DRI bills VIEWMAX as CUA-compliant, it still lookslike GEM to me.andP;  Furthermore, VIEWMAX suffers from many of the same problemsas the MS-DOS 4.0 shell-it looks somewhat like a graphical user interfaceuntil you use it and discover that it's not fast, powerful, or intuitive.andM;The DOS market continues to grow; the success of Windows 3.0 and DOSextenders make it likely that DOS will remain the dominant PC operatingsystem for many years to come.andP;  Digital Research appears determined tocapture a sizable chunk of this lucrative market.andM;Although DR DOS costs more than MS-DOS, it bundles several programs thatwould have to be purchased separately by MS-DOS owners: a disk cache, anextended memory manager and EMS emulator, and a PC-to-PC file transferutility.andP;  It will be interesting to see how Microsoft responds to thechallenge of DR DOS 5.0 when it releases MS-DOS 5.0 later this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
