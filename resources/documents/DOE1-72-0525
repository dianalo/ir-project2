Early detection of equipment degradationand failure play an important role in the effort to extend plant lifeand also provide improved operation of all plants, new and old, throughimproved reliability and safety. For the plant life extension period,prognostic monitoring techniques could offer an attractive alternativeto time-consuming and potentially expensive equipment replacement orrefurbishment. This paper discusses the investigation of two importantnuclear plant items for performance prediction methodologies: emergencydiesels and steam turbines generators. 4 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
