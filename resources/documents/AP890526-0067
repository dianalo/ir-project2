Students chanted anti-government slogans and songs at MyongdongCathedral to call for the fall of President Roh Tae-woo'sgovernment and demand police acknowlege they fatally torturedstudent leader Lee Chol-gyu.   ``Overthrow the murder regime!'' and ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!''protesters chanted. Riot police watched but made no move tointervene.   About 100 students chanted slogans at the Roman Catholiccathedral's main gate. The other students rested in the compound ortook part in discussion groups, taking water but no food. Studentsstayed out of the cathedral and administration buildings.   Radical student leaders said they were using the same tactics asChinese students fasting in Beijing to demand the introduction ofdemocracy and other sweeping changes. Some students claimed theywould fast to the death if their demands were not met.   ``We are more determined than the students fasting in China,'' astudent leader told a news conference after the protesters movedinto the cathedral compound overnight.   In recent days, newspapers have pointed out the differencesbetween the pro-democracy Chinese protesters and the anti-WesternKorean students, who demand an ill-defined ``workers and farmersstate.''   The newspapers have commended the Chinese for their peacefultactics and urged Korean students to end violent protests. Theeditorials have urged Korean students to abandon their leftistviews, saying the Chinese protesters are inspired by opposition tocommunism.   ``It is regrettable that some students and intelluctals in ourcountry are obsessed with socialism, an old ideology that communistnations are trying to reform,'' the moderate Jooang Daily News saidThursday.   Radical students in South Korea lack popular support because oftheir extreme views and violent tactics. Some student groups havebeen trying to switch tactics after six riot troopers were killedMay 3 in a clash in the southern city of Pusan.   A seventh riot trooper injured in the May 3 clash died Thursdaynight, police said. The deaths outraged the public.   Radical students and dissidents claim Lee was tortured andkilled by police and are demanding the government acknowledge acover-up. Lee's body was found May 10 in a reservoir near thesouthern city of Kwangju.   Police and government officials deny any official involvement inLee's death, although police tried to detain him at a roadblockjust before he disappeared. The government says an autopsy provesLee was not tortured, and officials speculate he slipped into thereservoir and drowned.   The protesters in the cathedral compound today put up posterswith color pictures of Lee's bloated body.   Crowds of up to 100,000 people marched in Kwangju last week todemand the government admit police killed Lee. The demonstrationsalso called for Roh's fall for the bloody suppression of a 1980uprising in Kwangju. Radicals claim the United States was involvedin Kwangju and are demanding expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troopsbased in South Korea under a defense treaty.   Protests in Korea often include the burning of U.S. flags, whichCulture and Information Minsiter Choe Byung-yul deplored today as``an uncivilized act'' intended to damage Seoul's friendship withWashington.   Also today, the government announced Foreign Minister ChoiHo-joong will lead a new government body of 10 vice ministers withauthority to decide on U.S.-related issues involving Americantroops, anti-Americanism and trade.   Seoul has been seeking greater control over crimes involvingAmerican troops and other matters.</TEXT></DOC>
