according to Newsbytes, mainframedata (text) is actually mapped into Macintosh objects - clickable icons,pictures, menus, windows, dialogue boxes, scrolling lists, and such, so thatthe mainframe program is transformed into a genuine Macintosh application -that's the theory anyway; no price.andM;a p p l eandM;Abaton Inc, Fremont, California has unleashed LaserScript at Macworld Expo:this 300 dot per inch PostScript-compatible laser printer for the Mac,MS-DOS, OS/2 and Unix environments is a multihost, multiapplication desktopmachine and is priced at $3,000;
