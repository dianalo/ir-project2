The Navy, in its report on the blast, concluded that Hartwig``most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type ofdetonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inchguns.   Navy officials did acknowledge that their evidence wascircumstantial in light of the fact that all the witnesses,including Hartwig, were killed in the blast in the battleship's gunturret No. 2.   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker, asked about the panel'scriticism, responded, ``We stand by our original report.''   The panel found fault with four aspects of the Navy'sinvestigation into the April 19, 1989, explosion as the battleshipsailed near Puerto Rico.   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman,said the flaws were the structure of the probe, the technicaltests, police work and psychological analysis.   ``First, the Navy convened a one-man investigation without theuse of formal hearings,'' Mavroules said in a statementaccompanying the report. ``If the Navy had convened a board ofseveral members operating through formal hearings, the theories andhypotheses that evolved would have faced more rigorous questioning.   ``Instead, there was an excess of certitude,'' he said.   On the technical inquiry, Mavroules said that when Navyinvestigators were told that Hartwig owned a timing device, thetests ``proved'' that a timer was used to trigger the blast.   Later, he said, when the timer information proved to be false,the technical tests ``suddenly found a chemical detonator to be thelogical igniter.''   Mavroules also criticized FBI psychologists who took part in theinvestigation, calling their analysis the ``real villain of thiscase.''   Last December, three FBI psychologists testified that Hartwig _based on his letters, interviews with the seaman's family andfriends and his personal history _ was ``egocentric, shy ... notsufficiently aggressive, had a low self-esteem.''   The psychologists cited various bits of information that whenpieced together, according to their assessment, form a picture ofan individual bent on self-destruction.   Mavroules said the FBI analysis was used as a substitute for athorough investigation.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the full Armed ServicesCommittee, said the Navy probe ``leaves us with something of a badtaste in our mouths.''   ``We are concluding that the Navy hasn't definitely found theculprit. But we haven't found the culprit ourselves,'' Aspin said.``Yet, I don't think reopening the original investigation will getus anywhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
