The unit, Enron Oil andamp; Gas Co., the nation's third-largest independent energy company, was valued at roughly $2 billion by investment bankers and analysts.    Enticed by the premium prices paid in a number of reserve transactions, Enron, one of the nation's largest natural gas pipeline companies, announced in mid-April that it would consider selling its oil and gas properties.    But the environment may have changed. &quot;The decline in oil prices since April and the volatility in oil prices&quot; were partially responsible for the lower-than-expected bids, said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview. &quot;And (natural) gas prices fell more this spring than some people expected.&quot;    Oil prices plunged about $2 a barrel in the month or so before Enron received its bids July 15. Prices for oil and gas properties were rising sharply earlier this year, with oil in the ground fetching as much $9 a barrel. But a number of industry officials said that the escalation was getting out of hand and that a price of around $6 a barrel was more reasonable given today's lower energy prices.    A glut of properties for sale may also have contributed to the low bids, Mr. Lay said. The largest seller, Tenneco Inc., has put $5 billion to $7 billion of oil and gas properties on the block. Texaco Inc. has invited bids on several hundred million dollars of reserves, while a large number of smaller packages remain for sale.    It's not immediately clear what effect Enron's decision will have on Tenneco and other sellers. It could suggest that Tenneco won't get as much as it hoped for, but it could also free up budgets to spend more freely on Tenneco.    The number of potential buyers for such big transactions is limited. &quot;Anytime you've got a large amount of reserves, you're eliminating a lot of candidates,&quot; said Kerry Thornhill-Cummings, a vice president of the investment banking firm Strevig andamp; Associates Inc., Houston.    Mr. Lay said more than a dozen potential purchasers looked at company data and a large number of those bid. &quot;It's not a matter that we didn't get some good bids,&quot; he said, &quot;but we didn't get the value we wanted.&quot; He added that, by keeping the unit, the company will better serve shareholders than by selling it.    The announcement came after the market closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron common shares rose $1 to $42 yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
