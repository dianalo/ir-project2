Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of theAgriculture Committee, called Wednesday for Congress to redirectU.S. foreign aid to protect the world environment.   He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he will introducea bill aimed at helping countries develop economic alternatives thatwill save forests and other natural resources.   ``We must make some tough choices, focusing limited foreign aidfunds on critical problems: tropical deforestation and energy waste,and in critical nations, even if we don't have programs there now,''he said.   According to a statement by Leahy's office, the ``InternationalClimate Change and Tropical Forestry Act of 1989'' would be aimed atproviding more aid to Third World countries where development oftenmeans the destruction of tropical rain forests.   The bill would authorize $10 million through the Agency forInternational Development for programs to improve energy efficiencyand the use of renewable energy resources in developing nations. Itwould also call for stronger forestry research programs, promoteinternational cooperation on reducing gas emissions.   Leahy said rising world temperatures threaten farming in theUnited States and other countries of the northern hemisphere. Manyscientists believe burning tropical forests and increased use ofcoal and oil as fuels contribute to a general warming of the globe.   Leahy has already introduced a bill that would force loweremissions within the United States of gases such as carbon dioxidebelieved to have the same effect.   ``Global climate change is a major threat to agriculturethroughout the world,'' he said.   ``With a doubling of carbon dioxide, corn production could bereduced by 25 percent. Increased temperatures could cut world riceproduction by as much as 40 percent.''   Leahy told reporters India and Brazil are countries where moreU.S. aid could be used. India gets some direct U.S. aid, mostly inloans to buy U.S. food, but the program has been reduced in recentyears. Brazil does not get U.S. economic help.   Most direct U.S. aid goes to countries seen as important to U.S.security, such as Israel, Egypt and the Philippines.   But ``foreign military sales is not necessarily where we shouldtarget,'' Leahy said in the interview. ``Traditional aid won't helpthe environment.''</TEXT></DOC>
