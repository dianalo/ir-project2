Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, was seized at his apartment inJibchit, 21 miles north of the Israeli border.   The Israeli military confirmed the seizure and said Obeid wassuspected of instigating attacks on Israel. It gave no details ofthe abduction.   President Bush told reporters in Washington he was unsure whateffect the raid would have on attempts to free the Marine. But Bushadded, ``I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the cause ofpeace'' in the Middle East.   He said his administration would contact Israeli officials todiscuss the abduction of Obeid and its consequences.   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of the pro-IranianHezbollah militia in south Lebanon and is Iran's closest ally inthe region. He denies links to Hezbollah, which is affiliated withShiite Moslem factions holding most of the 17 foreign hostages inLebanon. Nine hostages are Americans.   Security sources in south Lebanon said one of the Americans,Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was briefly held at Obeid'sapartment after his abduction in south Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.   Lebanese police said an Israeli helicopter landed a commandoforce about two miles west of Jibchit at 1 a.m.   About 12 commandoes walked into Jibchit, surrounded Obeid'sbuilding, then knocked on the door of his second-floor apartmentand forced their way in when the door was opened.   ``The Israelis quickly moved in pointing silencer-equippedpistols at the sheik, his cousin Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs, afriend who was staying with them,'' the spokesman said.   As the Israeli force was leaving with the three men, a neighbor,Hussein Abu Zeid, ``apparently heard some noise and opened his doorto find out what was happening. They shot him in the head and hedied instantly,'' the spokesman added.   Israel radio said the man was a bodyguard to Obeid.   The Israeli army communique made no mention of the slaying. Itsaid the Israelis suffered no casualties.   The police spokesman said Obeid's wife, Mona, was locked in aroom with her hands tied and her mouth taped. He said the Israelisalso locked the door where Obeid's three sons and two daughterswere sleeping.   A security source in Lebanon said there was speculation Obeidmay have been kidnapped ``as a possible swap'' for Higgins or forthree missing Israeli soldiers.   Two of the soldiers, Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, werecaptured Feb. 17, 1986, when guerrillas ambushed their patrol inIsrael's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon. Thethird, navigator Ron Arad, was captured by Shiite militiamen Oct.16, 1986, when his plane was shot down over southern Lebanon.   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., was heading an observer groupattached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon at the time ofhis abduction. He was seized in the southern port of Tyre, near thebase of the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia.   One of the Lebanese security sources said the late leader ofAmal in south Lebanon, Daoud Daoud, sent ``a group of his followersto obtain Higgins' release from Obeid's apartment, but the forcewas encircled by Hezbollah gunmen, stripped of its weapons and sentback.''   The source said Higgins' kidnappers, the Organization of theOppressed on Earth, then moved the Marine out of Jibchit.   Residents of Jibchit, which is 35 miles south of Beirut, saidAmal called a general mobilization of its militia in the area toconfront the Israeli force and rescue Obeid, but it was too late.   One resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, said localAmal leaders urged ``whoever is capable of carrying weapons to joina campaign in search of Sheik Obeid.''   ``I heard the helicopter flying as the general mobilization callwas blared,'' he said.   Obeid has been the imam, or local religious leader, of Jibchitsince 1984. He succeeded Sheik Raged Hard, who was shot to death byunknown gunmen.   The Israeli communique, issued more than 15 hours after theraid, said Obeid was raised and educated in Iran and was aninstigator of attacks on Israeli army forces and Israel.   ``He dealt with encouraging the struggle and authorizingterrorist attacks against Israel,'' the communique said. ``He alsodealt with passing on weapons to Hezbollah guerrillas in the southand arranging shelter for those who committed the attacks.''</TEXT></DOC>
