They can searchfor a single word or a phrase.andM;Nested searches, wildcard searches and proximity searches are supported aswell.andM;According to Folio Corp., several vendors, including Mead Data Central Inc.andO;-- developer of Lexis and Nexis on-line services -- Novell Inc. andWordPerfect Corp., are developing ready-made databases for Views processing.andM;Users can also create their own databases.andP;  To do this, the original textfile must be organized into divisions called ''folios,'' the building blocksof the database.andP;  Together, they form the ''infobase'' in Views.andM;Each folio should contain a single idea or concept so that search functionscan easily locate a particular section.andP;  Paragraphs are usually the point ofdivision in large infobases.andM;A word of caution, however: Where and how to divide the information intofolios is not necessarily intuitive or easy.andP;  If the infobase is a tax code,for instance, the user must determine the placement of tables of contents,figures and references.andP;  These divisions can be made arbitrarily, dependingon the intended use of the data, but they should be applied consistentlythroughout the infobase.andM;Users must then send the data file through the CREATE utility, whichorganizes the ASCII information into infobases.andP;  Text is indexed andconverted to the Folio proprietary file format at approximately 6M to 8Mbytes per hour.andP;  The resulting file contains both the index and originaltext, compressed to approximately half the size of the original text file.andM;Prior to running the CREATE utility, buyers can customize the data in severalways.andP;  Explanatory footnotes and cross-references can be included.andP;  Also,hypertextlike links to other sections of the infobase can be added.andM;For instance, links can be created between technical terms and a glossary, orbetween the index and the specific textual reference.andM;If a user finds an interesting reference in the index, pressing one keyautomatically retrieves the information pertinent to that reference.andM;Unlike some text search-and-retrieve software systems, Views allows users toedit the information contained in the infobase, as well as to append data tothe end of the infobase, using the program's word-processing features.andP;  Viewsthen updates the index for subsequent searches.andM;Folio Views also boasts an efficient security system.andM;An infobase can be completely secured so that only the creator of thedatabase, not users, can make changes in or gain access into the database.andM;Passwords, allowing the access of as many as nine individuals or groups, canalso be stored in the infobase.andP;  Each user or group can then be restricted toany subset of the programs's main functions, such as Edit, Read, Link andPrint.andM;To protect the providers of proprietary infobases from unauthorized copying,Views can restrict output to printers and disk drives.andM;Folio has been slowly building a large installed base of users that can takeadvantage of published information in the Folio format.andM;A read-only version of Views, called Folio PreViews, has been bundled withrecent versions of Novell NetWare that provide the same search-and-retrievefeatures as the full Views.andP;  However, users cannot create an infobase withPreViews; they must have the full Views product to do that.andM;For corporate buyers willing to invest some time in document preparation,Views' search-and-retrieve capabilities offer quick access to cumbersomedocuments.andM;Folio can be reached at (801) 375-3700.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
