In an interview on CBS television, the Iraqi presidentsaid, &quot;Kuwait is part of Iraq,&quot; and he denied reports that hehad offered any concessions to the U.S. to defuse thestandoff in the Gulf. At the same time, he tried to sound aconciliatory tone, asserting that he was &quot;prepared to conducta dialogue&quot; with President Bush and British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher.</LP><TEXT>   Even when asked provocative questions, including one aboutthe comparison President Bush drew between him and AdolfHitler, Saddam Hussein remained calm and spoke in carefullymeasured terms. But at one point he did show a flash of angertoward Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, an outspoken Arabcritic of the Iraqi invasion, saying Mr. Mubarak &quot;no longeris a friend.&quot;   Meanwhile, U.S. officials last night said they were stillwaiting for Saddam Hussein to fulfill his promise to releaseU.S. women and children who have been held hostage in Iraqand Kuwait. Margaret Tutwiler, the State Departmentspokeswoman, said Baghdad asked U.S. officials for the namesof those who want to leave in order to give them exit visas.She said: &quot;We are responding to that request.&quot; If Iraq letsthese foreigners go, she said, it would be &quot;a significantstep in the right direction.&quot;   Saddam Hussein's combination of defiant statements andpromises, in the view of a senior State Department official,is part of a campaign to buy time in hopes of sowing disunityamong the nations that are arrayed against Iraq. In additionto his interview with CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, theIraqi dictator appeared yesterday on French television.   There were reports yesterday that the Bush administrationhad received a number of overtures from intermediariesclaiming to represent Iraq. But the White House denied thatit has received any direct offer from Baghdad.   One report, in the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday,said that an unidentified official from a past U.S.administration suggested recently to National SecurityAdviser Brent Scowcroft that Iraq might be willing towithdraw its troops from Kuwait on the following conditions:an end to United Nations sanctions, guaranteed access to thePersian Gulf and ownership of a disputed oil field on theIraq-Kuwait border.   The White House confirmed that such a meeting occurred.But a spokesman said, &quot;There was nothing in this particularproposal that merited its pursuit.&quot; It was unclear where theideas originated.   The Bush administration, meanwhile, is sending toughsignals to Saddam Hussein. In a radio message to U.S. forcessweltering in Saudi Arabia's desert, President Bush said,&quot;Nobody's feeling the heat more than the government inBaghdad.&quot; Separately, NBC News reported last night that theU.S. is providing intelligence and training to the Kuwaitiresistance movement, which it said is mounting dailyguerrilla raids inside the occupied country.   The administration also confirmed that it is selling about$2.3 billion of weapons to Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15aircraft, 150 M-60 tanks, 50 Stinger anti-aircraft launchersand missiles and 150 spare Stinger missiles and 1,500 roundsof depleted uranium anti-tank ammunition.   The White House signaled that the arms sale is just thebeginning of a broader U.S. effort to arm the Saudis. &quot;We arealso looking at additional arms sales in the near term andlong range to help provide the Saudis with the forcestructure necessary to help them defend themselves,&quot; said aWhite House spokesman.   A group of U.S. Jewish leaders met recently with DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney and expressed support for theadministration's policy, including its decision to provide&quot;assistance for the defense of Saudi Arabia, to deal with thepresent emergency,&quot; according to a statement released by thegroup.   But the prospect of a continued military buildup in SaudiArabia is creating some concern among Israel's supporters inthe U.S. An official at Aipac, the major pro-Israel lobbyinggroup, said yesterday that Jewish leaders are worried thatthe weapons being sent to the Saudis someday could be turnedagainst Israel. &quot;It's simply an objective fact that thisstuff will be a substantial problem for Israel in thefuture,&quot; he said.   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said they see little basis fornegotiating with Iraq in the reported unofficial feelers thatare surfacing in Washington.   The U.S. would be loath to grant Iraq possession of an oilfield in return for a withdrawal from Kuwait, for instance,because such a concession would be seen as a reward for Iraqiaggression. In addition, an Iraqi request for guaranteed&quot;access&quot; to the Persian Gulf is widely viewed as a disguiseddemand for possession of strategic Bubiyan Island -- aKuwaiti island just beyond the mouth of the narrow Shattalrab waterway, now Iraq's only path to the Gulf. Iraq haslong coveted the island, but Kuwait has refused to considergiving it up.   The flurry of reports about possible Iraqi offers precedesa meeting between United Nations Secretary General JavierPerez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Azizscheduled for today in Jordan. The U.S. has said it approvesof that meeting, but Washington professes to have littleexpectation that it will bring about an Iraqi withdrawal fromKuwait.</TEXT></DOC>
