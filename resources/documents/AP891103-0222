The predominantly white crowd of parents and civil rightsactivists asked the board to establish more classes in humanrelations in the Talawanda school district, about 35 milesnorthwest of Cincinnati.   ``There are prejudices that exist. We should do everything wecan to get rid of this,'' Superintendent Dennis Leone said.   The march from the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church wasplanned after two students at Talawanda High School boarded aschool bus Tuesday wearing Klan robes as Halloween costumes. Theyshouted a racial epithet, witnesses said.   When they entered the school, other students made raciallyderogatory remarks, students and school officials said.   The students were suspended pending a Nov. 13 hearing, PrincipalLee Schmitt said. The school has refused to identify the students.   Schmitt said he would consider revising the school's curriculumto include more human relations courses. About 50 of the highschool's 1,100 students are black.   Victoria Nash, a march organizer who has a son in the district'selementary school, complained that the school does not offercourses in black history and that field trips do not includecultural or ethnic events.   Derek Rohrkamper, a senior, said he believed wearing the Klanoutfits was a mistake but that the demonstrators overreacted.   The students ``were going too far. But they apologized for itand said it was a joke,'' Rohrkamper said.   Other students said racial tensions have worsened at the highschool since the costume incident and a separate incident onThursday, in which students tore down posters announcing the racialunity march.   Three students were sent home Thursday for tearing down theposters, Schmitt said. One was suspended for two days, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
