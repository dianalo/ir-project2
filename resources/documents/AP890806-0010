Jomhori Islami, quoted by Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency,referred to the abduction of Sheik Abdul-Karin Obeid by Israelicommandos July 28.   ``If any group questioned the infliction of blows on Israel andthe United States before the Zionist abduction of Jibchit's Fridayprayer leader (Obeid), they are now resolute in their decision thatthere is no alternative but to inflict heavy blows on Zionistoccupiers and their supporters,'' the newspaper said.   It welcomed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar'scall for the release of all hostages held in Lebanon, according toIRNA, monitored in Nicosia.   But the newspaper criticized Perez de Cuellar for making thesuggestion only after the killing of American hostage Lt. Col.William R. Higgins. The Marine's pro-Iranian Shiite Moslemabuductors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation for Obeid'sabduction.   ``Why did he not ask for the release of all hostages earlier?When the execution of another American became serious heimmediately thought about a solution,'' Jomhuri Islami said ofPerez de Cuellar.   This reference was to U.S. hostage Joseph James Cicippio, 58,who is being held by the Revolutionary Justice Organization,another group of pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiites. The group gave him areprieve on Thursday and made a proposal for teh release ofLebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israel.   IRNA quoted the daily Abrar as echoing the words of IranianPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani in saying that ``the Lebanese issueand the hostage crisis have rational solutions provided the UnitedStates and the West see the realities in the world.''   Abrar said the United States and Israel conspired in thekidnapping of Obeid.   IRNA quoted the newspaper Kayhan International as saying thatHiggins and those facing a similar fate were victims of themistaken policies of the United States and Britain.   ``If the United States and Britain did not support the terroristIsraeli government ... the course of events would not be the waythey are today. Today they are reaping what they plantedyesterday,'' the paper said.</TEXT></DOC>
