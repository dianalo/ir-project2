How does Z{sub1}{sup *}/Z{sub 1} apply in explanation of quantities relevant to ourunderstanding of penetration of charged particles through matter, butother than stopping powers? The quantity that I would like to consideris the inner-shell ionization cross section. I will restrict myself toK-shell x-ray production cross sections by H and He ions because thesecomprise the data base that I have. This data base was gathered fromthe literature for another project and it consists of circa 6600 crosssections. 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
