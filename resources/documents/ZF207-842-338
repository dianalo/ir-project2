(products)Concept Omega Corp. (products)Empress Software Inc.

Inc. (Hawthorne, NY), andThoroughbred IDOL-IV from Concept Omega Corp. (Somerset, NJ).andM;All were tested on an NCR Tower 600 (built around Motorola's 68020microprocessor) using Release 2 of NCR's System V UNIX.andP;  The Tower used has 4MB of memory, a 100 MB hard drive, and a 60 MB 1/4-inch cartridge-tape drive.andO;Connected to the Tower are several Wyse 50 terminals.andM;OverviewandM;The three products display distinctly different styles.andP;  Empress is thedeveloper's development tool.andP;  It is a big relational database managementsystem, with impressive flexibility, that takes up nearly 8 MB of disk space.andO;Along with its flexibility comes a certain amount of complexity.andP;  ThefilePro+ product, on the other hand, is a menu-driven database package withroots in the PC world.andP;  The original version of filePro, called Profile, ranon the Radio Shack TRS-80 computers.andP;  While filePro+ tends to be easy tolearn and simple to use, it has some severe limitations.andP;  The Thoroughbred4GL, for its part, is built on Thoroughbred Business BASIC.andP;  It is designedto be a self-contained UNIX shell and command processor.andM;To compare these three rather large products, we have considered them inparts.andP;  First, we looked at the database management systems, the heart of4GLs.andP;  Second, we evaluated three important support tools--the screen editor,the menu system, and the report generator.andP;  Finally, we looked at theprogramming features in each product, including their 4GL languages, accessto 3GLs, and access to UNIX tools.andM;InstallationandM;Installation of all three products follows the UNIX axiom that says: &quot;Nothingis ever easy.&quot;andP;  Their installation is no more difficult than that required bymost UNIX applications.andP;  However, it is no easier.andP;  Empress, for example,requires the installer to understand tar or cpio, umask, and the passwordfile before moving to the conf directory to run the install script.andP;  Thefirst command spelled out completely in the installation notes is cd conf.andO;We knew that one.andP;  Someone new to UNIX might have trouble with the others.andM;The Thoroughbred 4GL installation guide neglects to mention that IDOL-IVneeds to be installed under the /usr/lib/basic directory.andP;  Fortunately,Thoroughbred's support group was able to clear things up for us.andP;  Until theinstallation guide is updated, we would advise users to call customer supportfirst.andM;The easiest of the three products to install is filePro+.andP;  It's simply amatter of reading the tape.andP;  The installation guide even includes the commandto do that.andP;  Unfortunately, the command is for the wrong tape drive.andM;Each product takes less than an hour to install (in our case, IDOL-IVrequired a few phone calls, too).andP;  Empress includes a helpful utility toverify that its product is working correctly.andP;  This utility takes a couple ofhours to run; it identified some missing Tower software for use when we ranit.andM;Documentation and SupportandM;The documentation for all three products is adequate, if not outstanding.andO;Empress provides by far the most documentation, weighing in with sevenpaper-bound books.andP;  The Empress documentation is more difficult to referencethan it might be because each physical book contains more than one logicalvolume, and there is no easy way to identify where one velue ends and thenext begins.andP;  Furthermore, the indexes do not make things any easier, sincethey rely on acronyms to identify the more than 20 different volumescontained in the set.andP;  However, the manuals are complete and otherwise easyto understand.andP;  The tutorial is straightforward, and is a valuable productintroduction.andM;In contrast to Empress, filePro + manages to fit its documentation into oneloose-leaf binder.andP;  The Small Computer Co. has issued a large insert for itsdocumentation to accompany the upgrade of filePro to filePro+.andO;Unfortunately, the insert does not work very well, using an awkward numberingscheme to mark its pages.andP;  Especially troublesome is the use of a secondindex to supplement--not replace--the first.andP;  If you do not find what you arelooking for in the first index, you have to check the second.andP;  A tutorialincluded with the documentation also suffers from the upgrade to filePro+.andO;There are a number of differences in the commands and response listed in thetutorial and those listed in the updated product (including the name of theexecutable module).andP;  Nevertheless, we were able to guess correctly andcontinue with the tutorial.andP;  The tutorial is a useful introduction to thepower of the product; we used its examples to do some exploring on our own.andM;Thoroughbred uses for loose-leaf binders for its well-presenteddocumentation--one each for the report generator, the 4GL programminglanguage, the database management system, and Business BASIC (an associated3GL).andP;  However, this documentation also has a few gaps.andP;  For example, thereis a section describing how to get help for the 4GL script editor.andP;  There isno description, though, of the procedures necessary to invoke the scripteditor.andM;On-line, context-sensitive help is available with each of the three products.andO;We found it useful.andP;  Empress has taken the extra step of providingdocumentation pages for inclusion with the UNIX man utility.andM;Calls we made to the respective companies' support groups were handledquickly and courteously.andP;  We requested some documentation that was missingfrom the original filePro package, and it arrived within two days.andP;  Inaddition, all three companies offer training classes for their products.andM;Database Management SystemsandM;In the DBMS contest, Empress emerges as the clear winner.andP;  Its relationaldatabase system is bigger, more powerful, and more flexible than filePro's orThoroughbred's.andP;  The capacities of the databases indicate the size of thedifference.andP;  Some telling examples are:andM;* filePro+ allows 999 fields per database file, while Empress allows 9999 pertable and then 9999 tables per database.andP;  Thoroughbred's record size is itsonly limit on the number of fields.andM;* Thoroughbred allows 8 million records per database and filePro+ allows 16million records per database, while Empress allows over 2 billion records.andM;* Thoroughbred and filePro+ set maximums of 32 and 16 KB of data per recordrespectively, while Empress allows more than 65,000 times that.andM;Obviously, whether these limitations matter to you depends on yourapplication.andP;  After all, not many companies have more than 16 millionaddresses on their mailing lists.andP;  Empress has other exceptional features,including an implementation of the industry-standard SQL query language andsupport for data distributed across a network.andP;  Empress also includescapabilities for storing binary data, suggesting interesting possibilitiesfor applications involving voice data or graphics.andM;Screen EditorsandM;Data display and input are an essential part of most business applications.andO;Using a 3GL, writing routines to control the behavior of the terminal screenis a slow process that is prone to error.andP;  Moreover, these routines aredifficult to update and improve.andP;  Therefore, screen editors are an importantbenefit of 4GL packages.andP;  All three of these products include fine screeneditors that provide similar functionality.andP;  All of the screen editors allowusers to select from a database the fields to be displayed and modified onthe terminal screen.andP;  Special terminal attributes (such as inverse video) aresupported.andP;  Developers can select the path of the cursor through the screen.andO;Empress des a field editor that allows developers to define editingoperations within a field (inserting new data as opposed to overwriting it,for instance).andP;  Empress also has powerful windowning capabilities.andP;  Verylarge forms can be displayed by scrolling its windows over a form to displaynew pieces.andM;All three products allow the display of help text with the data screen.andP;  Andthey all allow for the generation of a default screen from whichmodifications can be made.andP;  For all these products, the screen-editor userinterface is reasonably intuitive.andP;  both filePro and Thoroughbred make iteasy for developers to preview the screen during document creation.andM;Menu SystemandM;Another time-consuming task in 3GL programming is writing and maintaining themenus that control users' movements through an application.andP;  These threeproducts have powerful, easy-to-use menu systems that simplify this process.andM;We were particularly pleased with the filePro menu system.andP;  filePro+ menusare easy to set up and very powerful.andP;  Each menu option has three parts--achoice (a number or letter), a description (what the menu line says), and anaction.andP;  The action is the pathname of a program to be executed.andP;  Thisprogram can be anything: a filePro module, a UNIX tool, or something writtenby the developer.andP;  For example, one of the menus we have created allows us toenter data through a filePro screen, invoke the main filePro menu, start csh,or play backgammon.andP;  Furthermore, filePro+ allows the developer to designatetasks to be run in the background by simply adding flaps to the menu option.andM;There are some drawbacks to the filePro+ implementation, however.andP;  Developerscannot change the look or feel of the menus; there is no help facility withthe menus; the menu display feels slow, and the menu system does not seem toprovide for a way to skip intervening menus; and menus are limited to amaximum of 24 choices.andM;Thoroughbred solves some of filePro+'s menu problems.andP;  It allows up to 99selections per menu, each menu can be customized, and help windows can bedefined for each menu option.andP;  Thoroughbred allows users to enter the name ofa menu for shortcut access to it.andP;  The product also maintains a menu trailfor the application, making it easy to return to the previous menu.andP;  However,the menus, like the rest of the Thorouhbred package, have very limited accessto UNIX-level tools and programs.andM;The menus generated through Empress are a bit more complex than the others,but much more powerful.andP;  In order to build a menu in Empress, users mustdefine the window in which the menu is to appear, the form of the menu (whatit will look like), and any fields that are to be used for data input oroutput in the menu.andP;  A script is also necessary to display the menu and todefine a response to keyboard input.andP;  The fields of the menu are where thepower of Empress becomes apparent, as they can be programmed using the 4GL.andO;Keyboard function keys may also be programmed so that operations such asmoving or changing the size of a window, or deleting a record, may beaccomplished with a single keystroke.andP;  UNIX tools, as well as a UNIX shell,are easily accessed through the Empress menus.andM;Report GeneratorsandM;The report geenrator is the third major tool in a 4GL, alongside the screeneditor and the menu system.andP;  The report generator simplifies the task ofproducing printed output from a database.andP;  The printouts may be mailinglabels, quarterly reports, or paychecks.andM;The filePro+ product provides a simple-to-use set of menus for generatingreports.andP;  Printed reports are expected to be one of four types: a report fordisplaying data from any number of records, a mailing-label format, afull-page format for such things as paychecks, or a free-format report(unstructed).andP;  The filePro+ report generator can display data from only onefile, which is a serious limitation.andP;  Also, filePro+ allows only foursubtotal breaks (plus one for the grand total) and does not have the abilityto report on a set of records selected from a file.andP;  Its 4GL programminglanguage does permit developers to write scripts to work around some of theselimitations.andM;Report IV, Thoroughbred's report generator, is sold separately from theIdol-IV 4GL and was not included with the set of software we tested.andP;  Thefollowing comments are based upon a perusal of its documentation.andP;  Report-IVallows data from more than one file to be displayed in a report.andP;  The firstfile defined is read, and subsequent files are accessed depending on theirrelationship to the first.andP;  This report generator seems to provide a lot offlexibility, at the price of writing your report format in something thatlooks vaguely like COBOL.andP;  Report-IV does not limit the number of lines perreport page.andM;M-Writer, the Empress report generator, makes it possible to create reportsusing data read from an Empress database, imported from a 4GL application, orread from a UNIX text file (which must be in the Empress dump format).andP;  Usershave complete control of the format of the report, with no limit on thenumber of columns or lines on each page.andP;  Multiple tables within a databasemay be accessed, and a function that returns the width of the longest entryin a column makes table alignment quick and easy.andM;4GL LanguageandM;After all this, it's time we talked about the fourth-generation languagesthese products offer.andP;  Both filePro+ and Thoroughbred use languages basedloosely on the BASIC programming language.andM;The makers of filePro+ say its language is &quot;stripped down to a handful ofcommands and one type of statement, the If/Then&quot;.andP;  The filePro+ 4GL offersdevelopers commands to do fundamental string manipulation, accept and reactto user input, control data input and output, and do file handling.andP;  Thesescripts let developers do things the support tools would not.andP;  For example, adeveloper can display fields from more than one file in a report by using theLOOKUP command.andP;  Scripts are entered via the same prompting interface used tocreate menus.andP;  While this editor is very easy to learn, it might be annoyingto a more experienced user.andM;Thoroughbred's 4GL, Script-IV, is substantially easier to use than its BASIC3GL, but its developers have not eliminated some of the more onerousprogrammer duties users might prefer not to have to perform.andP;  Thoroughbredscripts come in six flavors: primary, continuation, overlay, public, copy,and file maintenance public.andP;  These different types have differentinvocations, different data environments, and different executioncharacteristics.andP;  Script-IV has the same limitations as Thoroughbred BusinessBASIC: program size is limited to 64 KB under UNIX (54 KB for DOS).andP;  To writea larger program, the developer must execute overlay scripts.andM;Script-IV also requires that data declarations begin in the first column of aline, that other commands be indented at least one tab stop, and thatprocedure names also begin in the first column.andP;  These requirements are onlya minor nuisance--but isn't the point of higher-level languages to get rid ofnuisances?andM;On a more positive note, Script-IV does provide full access to theThoroughbred data dictionary and thereby to all the formats, screens, help,and messages that make up the database.andP;  Script-IV has straightforward accessto BASIC data and routines, making it a very flexible language.andM;Empress' 4GL, M-Builder, is quite powerful, especially when used inscreen-intensive aplications.andP;  Scripts can be executed at various stages inthe application: upon entering or exiting, at the press of a function key, orwhen the cursor is moved into or out of a field on the screen.andP;  This lattercase offers many interesting possibilities.andP;  Moving the cursor into a fieldcan trigger the generation of a window that displays valid entries for afiled.andP;  When the cursor is moved out of a field, the application can checkthe value of the field entry and act accordingly, giving the use an errormessage, calling up more menus, or updating records.andM;M-Builder offers various levels of programmability, from a defaultapplication that can be used to view, insert, delete, or update records in atable without the need for programming, to an environment in whichcomplicated scripts making use of variables, expressions, and conditionalbranching can be written.andP;  M-Builder makes it easy to create, move, andresize windows, transfer data from the database to screens and back, and evenmake calls to the system or the database management system.andM;Applications must be complied and linked before they can be used.andP;  This addscomplexity and makes M-Builder seem more like a 3GL, but it also allows formodular programming, as functions (Empress calls them subscripts) may be usedfor many different applications.andP;  Forms can be changed to alter theappearance of a window, without the need to do a recompile.andM;3GL InterfaceandM;What do you do when your fourth-generation language cannot do waht you wantit to do?andP;  One answer is to do as much as you can with your 4GL and then usea lower-level language to do the rest.andP;  Unfortunately, filePro+ does notprovide access to its databases from a 3GL.andP;  Thoroughbred and Empress aremuch more flexible in this respect.andM;In fact, Thoroughbred Idol-IV is built upon the Thoroughbred Business BASIC3GL, which can have complete access to the variables and data used by the 4GLscripts.andP;  The Thoroughbred 4GL scripts can be executed from the 3GL commandline, and users can execute 3GL programs from a 4GL menu or script.andO;Thoroughbred BASIC provides a form of subroutine execution, as well as a hostof I/o directives.andM;Empress provides for several levels of database access from C and FORTRAN.andO;You can embed Empress query-language statements in a C or FORTRAN program andthen use a precompiler to generate the appropriate code to add, update,delete, or select rows from a table.andM;Empress also provides two levels of direct programmer access to its databaseusing Empress C or FORTRAN routines.andP;  In addition to the precompilerfunctionality, these routines provide the ability to lock and unlock tablesand records explicitly, rollback transactions, and build expressions.andO;Developing applications using these routines is not for the faint of heart,however.andM;Access To UNIXandM;An advantage of developing applications on UNIX is that UNIX provides a lotof tools, including text editors, source-code control systems, andcommunication packages, that make development work easier.andP;  In addition, asmore and better applications are becoming available for UNIX, it is morelikely that database systems will be expected to cooperate with andcontribute to other applications.andP;  For example, a user may want to capture adatabase report to a text file and then modify it with a word processor.andP;  Orour mythical user may need a report generated at midnight on the last day ofevery month.andP;  Instead of staying up all night once a month, that user maywant to use the UNIX cron facility to automatically invoke a database scriptthat will generate the desired end-of-month statement.andM;In general, filePro+ and Empress are well suited to this type of work.andP;  Bothproducts consist of a set of independently executable modules that acceptcommand-line arguments.andP;  As mentioned earlier, filePro+ can gracefully invokeother applications, as well as be invoked by them.andP;  Empress provides querylanguage facilities to execute other processes, store output from otherprocesses, and direct output to or from other processes.andM;Thoroughbred is not as cooperative.andP;  It requires that users explicitly definedirectories and tty devices.andP;  It even requires them to set a maximum programmemory size, instead of leaving that to the operating system.andP;  WhileThoroughbred does provide for user access to UNIX shells via its SYSTEMdirective, it is not possible to automatically invoke other processes fromthe command language or BASIC.andP;  Thoroughbred will not accept arguments, so tcannot be executed from another process.andP;  The power of UNIX is effectivelywithheld from Thoroughbred users.andM;Have you ever noticed that at the conclusion of their reviews, reviewersnever seem to tell you what to buy?andP;  We certainly do not want to break withthat tradition, but the following are some of our impressions.andM;Empress is our favorite.andP;  If we were doing development work with a 4GL, wewould want it to be one like Empress.andP;  The package is well though out, itprovides almost limitless flexibility and functionality, and the DBMS ispowerful.andP;  Its query language, combined with the various support tools, 4GLscripts, and access to 3GLs included in the package, allows developers toprototype an application and then fine-tune the result.andP;  However, Empressrequires some training and would not be suitable for casual development.andP;  Itspower is matched by its complexity.andM;The filePro+ package does what it does well.andP;  It is simple to use and wouldbe ideal for developing small applications.andP;  Novice users could teachthemselves the basic functions quickly and learn more advanced features attheir leisure.andP;  We believe it would be particularly well suited toapplications that run on both PCs and UNIX-based machines.andM;Thoroughbred's package is more awkward, carrying the baggage of its longerhistory and use under other operating systems.andP;  Script-IV is a powerful toolfor developers writing and maintaining applications in Thoroughbred BusinessBASIC.andP;  Users already comfortable with BASIC will be pleased with thispackage.andM;Finally, it's important to remember whence we came--all three of thesepackages will save you a lot of time compared to coding in 1s and 0s.andM;David Witzel is a software engineer with VMark Software.andP;  He is responsiblefor the uniVerse query language and report generator.andM;Frank Irwin is also a software engineer with VMark Software.andP;  He holds BS andMS degrees in geology from Texas Aandamp;M University, and is currently enrolled inthe Software Engineering program at Boston University.andM;Richard Morin, column editor, operates Canta Forda Computer Laboratory, aconsulting frim in San Bruno, CA, specializing in the application of UNIX toengineering and science.andP;  A former director of the Independent ComputerConsultants Association, Morin is currently on the board of the SunMicrosystems User Group.andP;  His electronic mail address is {hoptoad,pacbell}!cfcl!rdm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
