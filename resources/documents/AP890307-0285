We cannot afford the steady financialdrain.''   Matell said Eastern would continue to run only its mostprofitable routes _ its Northeast shuttle service betweenWashington, New York and Boston and three round trips weekly betweenMiami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.   The dramatic action in the 17-month labor dispute came afterEastern asked a federal judge in Miami to order the financiallyailing carrier's 3,600 pilots to stop honoring the Machinists'walkout and return to work.   ``The pilots are conducting their own economic strike against thecompany,'' Matell said. ``We believe that it is an illegal weapon togain (the Air Line Pilots Association's) economic objectives.''   He said 5,000 to 6,000 idled non-union employees were notifiedimmediately of their ``no-work'' status and would receive lump-sumpayments ranging from $270 to $640, depending upon their normalwages.   With more than 17,000 workers on strike, honoring picket lines orlaid off, Eastern has about 7,000 active employees, Matell said.   ``I just can't believe that they got away with this,'' said aweeping Diana Goss, 24, a ticket agent at Miami InternationalAirport.   She was one of a group of non-union employees going into ahastily called evening meeting with Eastern managers at theterminal. The laid-off employees were told to report back at 9 a.m.Tuesday to turn in their identification badges.   Matell said Eastern would file for bankruptcy only as a lastresort but indicated the pilots' walkout may force the airline toconsider the option.   ``We're not the ones who sought the strike,'' said Eastern pilotsunion head John J. Bavis. ``This is a strike that Mr. Lorenzocalled,'' he said, referring to parent Texas Air Corp. ChairmanFrank Lorenzo, whose anti-union reputation has galvanized Eastern'sunion employees.   The injunction request filed in Miami before U.S. District JudgeEdward B. Davis came as pilots nationwide planned a sympathyjob-action starting Tuesday morning that threatened to delay everyflight on every airline.   Eastern canceled almost all flights Monday but had supervisorshaul baggage and de-ice planes to keep its top-priority Northeastshuttle flying some scheduled trips between New York, Boston andWashington despite a snowstorm.   As of 8 p.m. EST Monday, 69 flights had taken off, 25 of them onthe Northeast shuttle, the airline said. Four or five more shuttleflights were expected by the end of the day. Before the strike,Eastern averaged 1,040 flights carrying 100,000 people daily.   Eastern pilots are honoring a strike by 8,500 mechanics and rampservice workers that began Saturday. The strike has grounded mostflights, stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation'sseventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse.   ``You can't fly without pilots,'' Matell said, adding thatEastern's future was under ``hour-to-hour evaluation.''   Before the strike, Eastern claimed losses of more than $1 billionin the last decade, $1 million a day and said it had $2.5 billion indebts stemming from its acquisition by Texas Air in February 1986.   A top credit-rating agency said Eastern's roughly $400 million incash will drain fast because the airline must pay competitors to flywaylaid passengers and is facing a $70 million debt repayment withinweeks.   ``The strike poses a serious threat to Eastern's survival, andmanagement may choose to cease operations or seek bankruptcyprotection if more pilots don't return to work soon,'' Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. said.   Matell said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying, but thepilots union put the number at 88. Eastern had 85 flights Saturdayand 93 Sunday, the company said, including three shuttle flightswith 14 or fewer passengers. Eastern averaged 1,040 flights dailybefore the strike.   The pilots union advised members Monday to ignore an order andpersonal plea from Eastern President Phil Bakes to return to work,alleging ``threats and intimidation'' by management.   The company said the pilots would be classified as strikers ifthey did not return to work by noon Tuesday. Eastern implied theycould risk their seniority, pensions and jobs.   Eastern asked the federal judge for a preliminary injunctionagainst the pilots union, ordering them back to work and requestingdamages. A Tuesday afternoon hearing was scheduled.   ``I think it's time to face this for what it is _ a pilotsstrike,'' Eastern spokesman James Ashlock said. ``We waited to seewhether this was an initial demonstration and whether they wouldcome on back, but now it's time.''   Eastern said under the 1926 Railway Labor Act the pilots mustcontinue negotiating a new contract and may not strike. The law saysunions may strike only after federal mediation, which the Machinistsunderwent before striking.   ``We knew that was coming,'' said ALPA Secretary-Treasurer RickChapman, adding that association attorneys would study the motion.   Eastern's 5,900 flight attendants also have honored the strike bymechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew. Eastern is seeking $150million in concessions while the Machinists are demanding $50million in pay raises.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland urged Eastern's flight attendantsand pilots to continue honoring Machinist picket lines.   ``Those three unions have stood shoulder to shoulder in anadmirable display of solidarity,'' Kirkland said at a newsconference in Washington. ``All of us stand ready to give you thesupport you need to see this mission completed.''   Federal Aviation Administration Associate Director AnthonyBroderick said inspectors are monitoring Eastern closely and therehad been no safety lapses.   He said the FAA is prepared to respond to the planned pilotsaction but didn't elaborate.   The national pilots union planned a teleconference for allmembers to explain the action set to begin at 6 a.m. Tuesday. Pilotswould strictly follow aviation safety rules, which coulddramatically slow air traffic.   ``It's an individual thing, obviously,'' said Jim Gray, a DeltaAirlines pilots' union spokesman. ``The captain of the plane decideswhat he wants to do. But we are encouraging our pilots to observethe fly-safe.''   The international Machinists union planned to appeal a federaljudge's order barring sympathy strikes on three New York-arearailroads that threatened to disrupt the morning commute for morethan 300,000 people. No strike-related transit problems werereported in any cities.   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson on Monday also temporarilybarred unionized Amtrak workers from honoring any picket lines byEastern Machinists.   In Washington, a White House spokesman said President Bush won'tpush for a bill banning secondary picketing unless the strikeagainst Eastern spreads.   The chairman of a House subcommittee scheduled a hearing forTuesday and said he hoped for quick action on legislation to forceBush to appoint an emergency board and halt the strike for 60 days.Bush had refused to intervene.   The sharp cuts in operations have affected thousands of Eastern's100,000 daily passengers. Eastern said many stranded Caribbeanvacationers were back on the U.S. mainland Monday.   A morning snowfall in New York and other problems forcedcancellation of 10 of the first 16 Eastern flights on the Northeastshuttle. Pan American World Airways was doubling service on the sameroutes.   Eastern officials in New York said employees were asked to wearwarm clothing and boots and supervisors handled baggage, de-icedplanes on the runway and worked as flight attendants to keep theshuttle flying.   In Atlanta, the Rev. Jesse Jackson donned an Eastern pilot's capand led chanting strikers in a prayer session at ContinentalAirlines ticket counter. Lorenzo broke a 1983 strike at Continentalby filing for bankruptcy.   ``If Lorenzo can't fly it, let the workers buy it,'' Jackson said.</TEXT></DOC>
