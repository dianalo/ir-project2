The bureau said the net increase of 2.3 million in population from the previous year resulted from natural growth of 1.7 million -- caused by 3.8 million births and 2.1 million deaths -- and estimated net immigration of 600,000. That figure includes an allowance for undocumented immigrants.    During 1987, there were 15.6 live births per 1,000 population, up from 15.4 in 1986, but below the 15.7 rate of 1985. The Census Bureau attributed the 1987 increase in the birth rate to an increase in the pool of potential mothers among the &quot;baby boom&quot; population of those born between 1946 and 1964, as well as increased childbearing by women in their 30s.    While the birth rates during the 1980s exceed the record low of 14.5 recorded for 1976, the bureau said there isn't necessarily evidence of a consistent trend.    Net immigration accounted for about 25% of overall growth last year, but the figure was down from the 1986 estimate of 662,000.    Overall, the U.S. population has grown by 18 million since the last census in 1980, the bureau said. </TEXT></DOC>
