(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Engineers installed a borrowedelectrical control unit in space shuttle Discovery on Thursday, andNASA said it was proceeding on a tight schedule toward aThanksgiving Eve launch.   Discovery's five astronauts will deploy a classified Pentagonsatellite, reportedly to eavesdrop on military and diplomaticcommunications.   The launch had been scheduled for next Monday night but waspostponed until Wednesday after an electronic unit destined foranother shuttle shorted out. Engineers blamed faulty wiring anddecided to check all other such units.   In doing so, NASA found a unit with suspect wiring in one ofDiscovery's solid fuel booster rockets and replaced it with a unittaken from space shuttle Columbia.   The unit routes all power, commands and data between thespaceship and the boosters and commands the separation of therockets after about two minutes of flight.   ``While the schedule is very tight, we feel we can make aWednesday launching,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.   Because the flight is classified, NASA and the Pentagon havesaid only that the launch will occur between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30p.m.. They will not make the exact time public until just nineminutes before liftoff.   Except for announcements on the landing day and time, there willbe a news blackout during the mission unless something major goeswrong.   The flight is expected to last four days.</TEXT></DOC>
