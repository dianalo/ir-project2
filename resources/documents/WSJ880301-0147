Meanwhile, customers fumed.    Then Mechanics hired the PacTel Spectrum Services network management unit of Pacific Telesis Group, a regional Bell company, to pinpoint the problems. Now &quot;We never have more than a couple hours of down time,&quot; says Anthony J. Chavez, Mechanics vice president, data processing.    PacTel Spectrum is one of many concerns working the hottest product development area in telecommunications: network management. As their vast phone and computer networks swell and proliferate, companies find that the software and processing systems to manage them have become critically important.    For International Business Machines Corp. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., network management has become essential in the race to dominate the market among retailers, banks, brokerages and manufacturers for large phone, video and computer networks. Because customers increasingly want computers that hook into manageable systems, &quot;Network management is crucial to what we are doing in telecommunications,&quot; says Ellen M. Hancock, an IBM vice president who heads its Communication Systems Group.    While IBM and ATandamp;T draw up battle lines, the rest of the industry is scrambling to develop software compatible with either giant's plan. Some companies have bought technology. Several computer companies have allied with makers of multiplexers, relatively obscure pieces of equipment that boost phone line capacity and usually incorporate some network management functions. &quot;Without question, network management is the biggest issue for our company,&quot; says Martin Singer, director of marketing at Tellabs Inc., a Lisle, Ill.-based maker of multiplexers resold by ATandamp;T.    Last year, Unisys Corp. bought Timeplex, another multiplexer maker, to form the core of a new network and network management unit. Network Equipment Technologies Inc., a hot new multiplexer concern in Redwood City, Calif., has a network management development pact with IBM, which also is rumored to be interested in forming a relationship with PacTel Spectrum. IBM declines to comment. A number of companies have sprung up, which, like PacTel Spectrum, sell network management services instead of software. Telecommunications managers say Digital Equipment Corp. also is developing major network management products. Rockwell International Corp.'s telecommunications unit also is trying to sell network management software to large companies, as well as to the Bell companies.    But just what is &quot;network management&quot; generates intense debate. The size of the market is unclear, because network management software usually is sold along with basic communications and computer equipment. Forrester Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass., estimates that Fortune 1000 buyers spend about $500 million a year on such systems, or 1% of their total communications budgets, and will increase that to $2.8 billion, or 3.7%, by 1991.    What is clear is that customers are becoming increasingly reluctant to buy gear that doesn't link into a system that controls an entire network. &quot;Any . . . product that isn't easy to manage is going to fall by the wayside,&quot; says John Miller, ATandamp;T's director of network management market planning. &quot;Customers face a dilemma between building more powerful information networks and creating the greater burden of managing that complexity.&quot;    Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., for example, manages and monitors links to its more than 600 brokerage locations in the U.S., Canada and overseas from a low-rise, yellow brick building in lower Manhattan. The increasing globalization of securities markets has forced Merrill's communications managers to keep the network running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. &quot;Without the links, we can't do business,&quot; says Kenneth Stagg, a vice president who manages Merrill's network group.    But it isn't easy to identify those links that are down and those that have problems, and to figure out their traffic loads. Merrill buys gear for its network from more than 30 vendors, and each piece has its own peculiar way of tracking the equipment's performance. Since the break-up of the Bell system, Merrill can't go to one phone company each time a line fails. Usually, it must pinpoint the failure itself to forestall finger-pointing between, say, New York Telephone Co. and ATandamp;T.    To manage this vast maze of wires, computers, switches and terminals that it has dubbed Mernet, Merrill has installed a disparate hodgepodge of terminals from a dozen or so companies. In one corner, terminals run network management software from Racal Corp., a data communications concern. Nearby are similar terminals running different, but similarly functioning, network management software from ATandamp;T, Network Equipment Technologies, Northern Telecom Ltd., General Datacomm Industries Inc. and Unisys's Timeplex.    No one yet has developed a comprehensive system to manage any of these huge networks. But IBM and ATandamp;T have drawn up opposing plans to develop standards. Industry consultants say Digital Equipment will emerge as a third major contender later this year when it announces a new network management product; Digital Equipment won't comment on future product plans, but one executive says its current network management products will evolve to manage devices made by other companies.    So far, however, IBM is leading the pack, having commercially introduced its NetView PC software, which manages networks of IBM computers, Rolm phone switchboards and IBM's local area network. IBM also published enough details about its product to allow for some compatibility with equipment of outside vendors. IBM says at least 29 telecommunications equipment vendors have pledged to make their gear work with its NetView PC product, which it hopes will become, de facto, an industry standard.    While sales of IBM's older NetView product, which manages only networks of IBM computers, exceeded expectations last year, results were disappointing for NetView PC, IBM product managers say. Customers want more graphics, and fewer vendors have developed products compatible with NetView PC than IBM anticipated.    ATandamp;T last fall said it would develop its own standards, called Unified Network Management Architecture. It doesn't yet have a commercial product in the market, and it has announced two initial products that will only manage ATandamp;T phone equipment and lines, though ATandamp;T says one product will hook into IBM's NetView.    Competitors believe it may be two years before ATandamp;T has a comprehensive product, because the company wants to use network management standards that aren't fully agreed upon by industry standard-setting bodies. But that won't hold ATandamp;T back, Mr. Miller, the network management planning official, says.    Meanwhile, many companies are contracting with specialized software houses for custom-made systems, while some are giving up on plans to build networks and turning back to the local phone company.    Du Pont Co., which is installing a new network in the U.S. connecting 108,000 phones and computer terminals, will use IBM's NetView for its computer network, ATandamp;T software for its voice network and parts of two computer networks, Digital Equipment software for parts of the Digital network, Network Equipment Technologies' multiplexers for another part of the network, and special software from Atlantic Research Corp. that will bill departments for phone use from 20 office switchboards.    Many companies have turned to closely held Applied Computing Devices Inc., based in Terre Haute, Ind. William Schindel, president and founder, says the company's backlog of orders is the largest in 14 years. &quot;When you get right down to it, network management is a highly arcane discipline,&quot; Mr. Schindel says. &quot;In its infancy, you will see something less than universal systems until further enhancements are made.&quot;    ---                  Managing Computer Networks    Estimated spending by Fortune 1000 on network management out of total communications budgets                     TOTAL          NETWORK                     BUDGET        MANAGEMENT                  (In billions)   (In billions)   PERCENTAGE    1987              $50             $ .5           1.00%    1988               55               .7           1.27    1989               60              1.1           1.83    1990               66              1.7           2.57    1991               76              2.8           3.68    Source: Forrester Research Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
