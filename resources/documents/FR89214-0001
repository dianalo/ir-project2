This condition, if not corrected, couldlead to weakening of the wing structure, and could eventually lead to failureof the wing.Canadair has issued Alert Wire 44T-1340/2431, dated October 28, 1988, whichdescribes procedures for visual and NDT inspections for corrosion damageof the upper wing skin. Transport Canada, which is the airworthiness authorityfor Canada, has issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF-88-21, datedNovember 2, 1988, making compliance with the Canadair Alert Wire mandatory.This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this situation is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, this AD requiresrepetitive visual and NDT (ultrasonic or eddy current) inspections in accordancewith the alert wire previously described, and repair, if necessary, inaccordance with a method approved by the FAA.Additionally, this action requires that operators submit a report of theresults of their inspections to Canadair for evaluation and a determinationof an appropriate repair scheme.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB Control Number 2120-0056.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this documentinvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

Within 225 hours time-in-service or 30 days after the effectivedate of this AD, whichever occurs first, and thereafter at intervals notto exceed 12 months, perform a visual inspection of the upper wing skinarea between the front and rear spars over the total wing span for corrosion,including raised blistering or bulging, in accordance with Canadair AlertWire 44T-1340/2431, dated October 28, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. If the extent of such corrosion exceeds 20 sq.in. in any one skinpanel, between chordwise joints, prior to further flight conduct a non-destructivetesting (NDT) inspection, using ultrasonic or eddy current inspection techniques,to determine the skin thickness, in accordance with the Alert Wire. Repairthe corrosion area prior to further flight, in accordance with a methodapproved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, NewEngland Region. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. If the extent of such corrosion exists within an area equal toor less than 20 sq.in. in any one skin panel, between chordwise joints,repair corrosion area within 900 hours time-in-service or 6 months afterthe effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. Repair must be accomplishedin accordance with a method approved by the Manager, New York AircraftCertification Office, FAA, New England Region. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B.
