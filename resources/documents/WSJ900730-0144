The Transportation Department would retain discretion todraft the proposed rules, but the spending measure virtuallydictates that the ban take effect within a year unlessTransportation Secretary Samuel Skinner determines that theprohibition wouldn't improve highway safety.</LP><TEXT>   Radar detectors already are prohibited by a few states,including Connecticut and Virginia. But the proposed federalban would be far more sweeping and would apply to all driversof commercial motor vehicles. The proposed rules would takethe form of amendments to federal motor carrier regulations,and violators would be subject to civil fines or criminalpenalties, according to a legislative report filed by theSenate Appropriations Committee.   The underlying measure, approved by the full committeelast week, rejects proposed cuts in rail and mass transit andrepresents a nearly 5% increase from the Bushadministration's transportation budget for the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1. While trimming the larger House-passedbill, New York and New Jersey senators added almost $150million for the Northeast rail corridor, and the totalfigure, $165 million, represents a more than sixfold increasein current aid.   Coast Guard acquisition and construction accounts would beincreased by $40.4 million from the House-passed level. Andwhile cutting the projects of House lawmakers, senatorssalted away hundreds of millions for endeavors of their own.More than $160 million -- none of which was in theadministration's budget -- was secured for highways backed bySenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D.,W.Va.).   The proposed Coast Guard budget relies on the transfer of$300 million from the Pentagon, and the military's fightsover weapon contracts can spill over into Coast Guarddecisions on buying its equipment.   General Motors Corp.'s Allison Gas Turbine division andTurbomeca Engine Corp., a Texas unit of Labinal Corp. ofFrance, have a competing interest in building replacementengines for the Coast Guard's HH-65 Dolphin helicopter, forexample. The dispute is driven partly by Allison's stake inthe development of its T-800 engine for the Army's costly newlight helicopter.</TEXT></DOC>
