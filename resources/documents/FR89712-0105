L. 96-330) established the Departmentof Veterans Affairs Health Professional Scholarship Program to assist inproviding an adequate supply of trained physicians and nurses for VA andfor the nation and, if needed by VA, other specified health-care professionals.The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-322) amendedthe Scholarship Program by permitting scholarship awards to students inadditional health disciplines, by changing length of service obligationincurred by scholarship participants, and by changing priority for selectingparticipants. These new regulations implement section 322 of Pub. L. 100-322enacted May 20, 1988.On January 18, 1989, proposed regulations to 38 CFR Part 17 implementingPub. L. 100-322 were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on pages 1950 through 1953 (54 FR 1950). Interestedpersons were given 30 days to submit comments, suggestions, or objections.The Department of Veterans Affairs received three letters. Each writersuggested that andSection; 17.600 of the proposed regulations be modifiedto list all eligible health disciplines. The final regulations have beenchanged to list all disciplines for which VA may award scholarships ifthey are needed to relieve staff shortages.Two writers commented that andSection; 17.600 implies VA has authority toaward scholarships to physical therapy students without notifying the Committeeson Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives. The lawrequires VA to notify the Committees prior to awarding initial scholarshipsto students in any discipline other than nursing or medicine. VA does nothave authority to use the regulation to overturn a provision of the law.Two writers suggested that the definition of degree in andSection; 17.601(h)include the doctor of optometry degree. Doctor of optometry and doctorof podiatry degrees have been added in final regulations.One writer suggested public interest would be served if specific VA criteriafor determining existence of staff shortages in various disciplines, astatement describing VA's policy for determining disciplines, and a listingof factors and personnel data used to decide upon eligible disciplineswere to be made publicly available in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>We do not believe it is necessary for criteriato actually be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>since the regulations make reference to the existenceof such criteria.One writer suggested that eligible degrees be published annually in the<T4>Federal Register. </T4>Information about eligible degrees is broadlydisseminated by VA on an annual basis through a press release to the generalpublic and through program announcements to professional associations andall accredited colleges/universities. It is indeed intended by VA to continueto broadly announce the program and; consequently, we do not believe itis necessary that eligible degrees be published annually in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>VA finds that for good cause, the regulations should be made effectiveretroactively to May 20, 1988, the effective date of Pub. L. 100-322, whichthe regulations implement. Good cause for a retroactive effective dateexists because a delayed effective date would be contrary to the publicinterest. The law which the regulations implement was liberalizing in thatit extended scholarship benefits to new groups of students. Moreover, Congressintended that it be implemented as soon as possible. To achieve the maximumbenefit of the legislation, it was implemented prior to amendment of implementingregulations. A retroactive effective date will ratify actions to implementthe program prior to publication of the final regulations, and will simplifyadministration of the law.These final regulations have been designated as non-major under the criteriaof Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. The regulations will notresult in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in costs or prices or consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies or geographic regions; or (3)significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Secretary hereby certifies that these final regulations will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U.S.C. 601-612.These final regulations will be directed to individuals who apply for andare selected for VA Health Professional Scholarship Program awards. Theywill, therefore, have no significant direct impact on small entities.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this program is 64.023.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 17</ITAG>Health professionals, scholarships and fellowships.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: June 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
