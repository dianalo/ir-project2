(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   US West Inc., six foreign companies and theSoviets plan to build and operate the world's longest fiber-opticphone line, a $500 million project that will span the Soviet Union,officials announced.   US West, a regional phone company based near Denver, saidThursday it will form a corporation with the six other firms tomanage constructon of the line, which will have underseaconnections to Denmark, Italy and Japan. The same corporation willoperate the line, said US West spokesman Ed Mattix.   The 9,500-mile system would include 6,000 miles across theSoviet Union, basically following the route of the Trans-SiberianRailroad. The line will connect Denmark and Italy with Moscow, andJapan to Vladivostok in the eastern Soviet Union.   Construction would take three to five years and may begin bymid-1990, Mattix said.   The seven companies will work with the Soviet Ministy of Postsand Telecommunications to form the Trans-Soviet Line DevelopmentCorp.   Construction will begin after the companies and the Sovietgovernment have reached agreements on a business structure andreceived government approvals, he said.   Western governments now restrict the export of the technologyinvolved in the fiber-optic line because of its possible strategicvalue, Mattix said.   Governments of the countries involved will review the plans andwill have to approve them before the project could proceed, he said.   Other companies involved in the venture are Kousai Denshin Denwaof Japan, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of Italy, British TelecomPLC, OTC of Australia, the Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of WestGermany and Great Nordic Telegraph Co. and Telecom of Denmark.   Fiber-optic cables use strands of glass as thin as hair totransmit phone calls and data communications in the form of burstsof laser light. They are far more efficient and handle a fargreater number of calls than traditional copper cables.   The line would carry international phone calls as well aslong-distance phone calls within the Soviet Union, officials said.   The project was announced Thursday by Dick Callahan, presidentof US West Diversified Group, and G.G. Kudriavtzev, first deputy ofthe Soviet ministry.   Forming the corporation is ``the next step in our efforts toconstuct this major telecommunications link,'' the two said.</TEXT></DOC>
