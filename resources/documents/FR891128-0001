This is particularly importantto the Service when seeking to obtain criminal convictions. Presently,records are requested by an immigration officer through an INS districtoffice closest to the location where the records are located. When therecords are received by that office, it is sent to the appropriate Americanconsulate for authentication. It is then returned to INS to be forwardedto the officer originally requesting the record. By eliminating the authentication,one time consuming step is removed. It is deemed that the record keepingsystem of the Canadian governmental records_federal, provincial and localare comparable to our own and that authentication by an American consulateis an unnecessary step in the process. Shortening the time to obtain recordscan conserve resources by reducing the time and expense necessary to detainCanadian citizens and nationals facing expulsion from the United Statesbecause of their history of criminal conduct.The Service published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 18, 1989 at 54 FR 38387. The commentperiod for the proposed rule ended on October 18, 1989. The Service receivedonly one comment. The commenter stated that the language of the proposedrule would appear to suggest that only records from the federal governmentof Canada are affected. The commenter recommended that the words ``issuedby a Canadian governmental entity'' appearing in the proposed rule be substitutedby the words ``issued by the Government of Canada or any political subdivisionthereof.'' It was the intention of the Service that all Canadian governmentalentities be included in the rule_federal, provincial and local. In consideringthe commenter's proposed language, it was felt that local governments werenot political subdivisions of Canada but rather subdivisions of the provinces.An analogy might be made that the United States government could not normallyinterfere with a redrawing of county lines by a State absent some discriminatorypurpose since the county is a subdivision of the State and not of the UnitedStates federal government. However, to alleviate any conceivable misinterpretationof the proposed rule, it has been amended to read `` * * * issued by aCanadian governmental entity within the geographical boundaries of Canada* * * '' which should make it clear that federal, provincial and localgovernment documents are included within the reach of the rule.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This is not a major rule within the meaning of section1(b) of E.O. 12992, nor does this rule have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 287</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Subpoenas, Deportation.Accordingly, part 287 of Chapter I of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 287_FIELD OFFICERS; POWERS AND DUTIES</ITAG>1.
