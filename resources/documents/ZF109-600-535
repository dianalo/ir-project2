 Non-Romanpublishing was the largest subgroup: DynaLab, Knox and SKW demonstratedAsian-language software, and Diwan exhibited wire service products used forArabic publications.andP;  Open Text and Verity focused on text search andretrieval.andP;  Software Exoterica and US Lynx highlighted SGML- and CALS-relatedproducts (Open Text didn't show its newly announced SGML/Search program).andO;Other vendors showed software for image and data management or for buildingand managing advertisements.andM;Rather than scatter these vendors among so many subgroupings, we have listedmost of them alphabetically under the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; banner.andP;  The non-Romanpublishing vendors appear under a small heading at the end of this section.andM;Managing Editor adds a few featuresandM;Page Director is a program for managing the elements of a publication.andP;  Ithelps the user to organize material, from sizing content to pagination.andP;  Wecovered it in depth this summer (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  21).andM;We saw few changes in San Jose.andP;  The program now has improved reporting andlayouts with head calls, dates, etc.andP;  Also new was a facility to store 2,048color configurations in the librry.andP;  The program is now available as a QuarkXpress 3.0 Xtension for $895.andM;Managing Editor told us that its plans for the future include a means of pagetracking and another data management functions.andM;Multi-Ad introduces image databaseandM;Multi-Ad Services' Creator becomes more accepted each day as a proven&quot;retail&quot; product dedicated to professional display ad make-up.andP;  As thishappens, the market continues to press Multi-Ad for more database managementtools and database control for images.andP;  This is especially true with high-endpublications that need multiple networked terminals and in catalog work,where tracking thousands of pieces of artwork--scanned or created--isimperative.andM;At the Exposition, Multi-Ad introduced such a tracking program: Graphic ArtsCatalog.andP;  In its simplest terms, it is a database for logos, scanned andcreated art and any other images that may be stored in the system.andM;The database is very simple, using five user-definable fields that areattached to each graphic element stores in the system.andP;  For example, using akeyword field as one of these, a user could search the database for allobjects called &quot;shoes.&quot;andP;  Fields such as &quot;type of artwork&quot; can be used tocategorize groups of images (for instance, all cars or trucks); other fieldscan be used to fine-tune searches.andP;  Dates (such as expiration dates) can alsobe employed to facilitate managing images that must be purged automaticallyafter a certain period of time.andM;The database is totally independent of the filing structure, allowing imagesto be stored in several locations and on several different type of storagemedia (CD-ROM, magnetic or tape).andP;  The database simply contains pointers tothe actual image files.andM;Multi-Ad will sell Graphic Arts Catalog as a separate product, but its closeintegration with Creator (the ad make-up product) is guaranteed.andP;  Apasteboard is currently used for integration between the two products.andM;Open Text search engine has new MotifandM;As part of a tem working on the New Oxford English Dictionary Project,programmers at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) developed a textsearch engine in 1986.andP;  They continued to refine the search and displayalgorithms and finally, earlier this year, formed a company to market thesoftware.andM;Open Text Systems sells several products: PAT, the text search system;Lector, which can display marked-up text in real time on an X Windowterminal; and the Transduction Toolkit, which can convert text betweendifferent markup formats (e.g., into SGML).andM;Although this software had been seen before, the Exposition was the firstpublic showing of Open Texths new Motif interface.andP;  Operation on a DECstation3100 appeared smooth and quick.andM;Open Text advertises PAT as &quot;the fastest search system in the world.&quot;andP;  Such aclaim surely depends heavily upon the type of search, but PAT is fast.andP;  Fullsearches on the 580-MB Oxford English Dictionary database took no more than afew seconds.andM;When a search is performed, a list of &quot;hits&quot; appears in a window.andP;  Theoccurrences of the desired string are vertically aligned, with contextsurrounding them.andP;  The user selects an entry from the list; it is thendisplayed with all available formatting and context in a separate window.andM;The program could also display a skeletal view of an OED entry's outline,indicating the component in which the searched-for string appears.andP;  Similarviews can be constructed from other types of documents, depending on how theyare marked up.andM;Unusual approaches.andP;  Unlike most text search programs, PAT is based not uponwords but upon character strings.andP;  Therefore, with a properly indexeddatabase, it can search for strings, words and phrases.andP;  Indexing points canbe placed at every character or (to limit the size of the database) only atmore useful places, such as beginnings of words.andM;Another unique strength is PAT's ability to work with data structures.andP;  Forexample, a search through the OED could be restricted to find onlyoccurrences of a text string within the etymology section of noun entries.andM;In addition to the usual proximity and boolean criteria, the user can definesearches by frequency (e.g., the three most common words starting with&quot;green&quot;), change the amount of context displayed, sort matchesalphabetically, search on alphabetical or numerical ranges, and perform otherunusual operations.andM;A PAT user can perform complex searches by combining groups of &quot;hits.&quot;andP;  Theaccompanying illustration shows the sort of procedures the user can follow.andM;User setup is key.andP;  This sort of power does not come without goodpreparation.andP;  A text database must be properly tagged for PAT to work best.andO;The more thorough the markup, the more precise the search can be.andP;  Finally,the text must be indexed; Open Text says that PAT can index 100 MB in aboutsix hours.andM;Lector generates typography on the screen in real time according touser-defined stylesheets.andP;  The user can specify such attributes as font,size, style and color.andM;Pricing for PAT licenses depends heavily on the server hardware involved.andP;  Itstarts at $10,000 U.S.andP;  for '386 PCs (running Unix) and some low-endworkstations and reaches $40,000 for the most powerful platforms.andP;  Inaddition, the buyer pays $3,000 for the first client terminal license andgradually less for each additional one.andP;  Lector and the Transduction Toolkiteach cost 40% of PAT's price.andP;  Academic pricing is lower.andP;  Users can alsolease the software with options to license it.andM;SGML/Search.andP;  At the concurrent Frankfurt Book Fair, Open Text unveiled aprogram called SGML/Search that works with PAT and Lector to turn SGMLdocuments into databases.andP;  Through PAT, a user can then construct complexqueries on information in those databases.andM;SBML/Search was designed specifically with SGML in mind, not merely generictagging in general.andP;  It can use all information available in the SGMLmarkup--attribute values, element hierarchies, etc.andP;  For instance, the queryset1 = andless;TASK FUNC = &quot;400&quot;andgt;{andless;TITLEandgt;{&quot;fuel&quot;}} would construct a user set (set1)consisting of all TASKS whose attribute FUNC equals 400, and that contain aTITLE that contains the word &quot;fuel.&quot;andM;Open Text will offer SGML/Search as a PAT/Lector add-on, for a fraction ofPAT's price, or as an autonomous package with no direct PAT access.andP;  It plansto release SGML/Search this December in data server form, running under Unixand offering only a query language interface.andP;  Client applications for bothUnix (Motif) and DOS (Windows 3) are scheduled for the first quarter of 1991;they will let application developers set up hypertext-like, Lector-basedinterfaces in which users can navigate by clicking on illustration referencesand text cross-references.andM;A prototype of SGML/Search will be demonstrated at CALS Expo in Dallas,December 3-5.andM;PCN adds valuable Mac linkandM;Picture Classified Network's products capture, store and manage large numbersof photos and images for image-intensive publications such as real estatemagazines and used car publications.andP;  At the Exposition, this firm introducedits new link with the Macintosh, which will be used with off-the-shelfsoftware as a peripheral for color separation and image manipulation.andP;  Oncethe Mac is finished with photos, they are returned to the DOS-based PCNsoftware for inclusion in the database with other images captured in avariety of ways using PCN software and hardware modules.andM;This link is an important enhancement for a company that has already provenits ability to handle large volumes of photos and to include them withinheavily formatted publications.andP;  The ability to interface to the Mac (and itsmany software options) adds to the potential quality and amount of color thatPCN will be able to address.andM;SCS improves ad selling, ad mergingandM;Software Consulting Services showed progress on its classified ad system,primarily in improving the forms used for selling ads.andM;SCS has been criticized for its screen layouts used for taking ads.andP;  Itsbooth contained the beginnings of a much cleaner and more user-friendly setof pop-ups and prompt windows to help the ad taker do his or her job.andO;Searches and prompts to help upsell ads, and features such as automatic boxgeneration to simplify the process, should help the selling process itself.andO;One of the biggest improvements is the new publication and run schedulescreen, which should greatly simplify the ad scheduling process.andM;This was helpful and good progress for a company that is known primarily asthe expert in ad dummying, with its Layout-8000 program.andP;  It is also becomingknown for its useful Xtensions to Quark Xpress.andM;SCS has made it easier to include ad dummies automatically within Quarkpages.andP;  Upon output, ads can automatically replace the reservation spacesreserved by the Layout-8000 software.andM;Ad merging: doubly desirable.andP;  One of the more useful features that is stillmissing is the ability to merge these ads directly at any PostScripttypesetter without special software.andP;  This ability would help the user in twoways.andM;First, it would greatly reduce the amount of data shipped to the typesetterat deadline, allowing the ads (along with large amounts of graphics) to besent (or made available to) the typesetters well before the pages thatcontain them.andP;  Second (and possibly more importantly), it would simplifyintegration between the page make-up system and the ad system.andP;  Ads wouldn'thave to be integrated during page make-up, which has always complicated theintegration task.andP;  They would simply become picture calls to the typesetter,which would locate the ads and place them in their reserved spaces.andP;  Ineffect, the typesetter would become the integrator.andM;The OPI approach.andP;  All typesetter manufacturers are trying to accommodatethis scenario in one way or another.andP;  The Open Prepress Interface (OPI)standard is potentially the simplest, most universal and most effective wayto handle it.andP;  But OPI has one hangup, which until now has made this taskmore difficult.andM;Pages from page make-up programs like Xpress could easily be made to containOPI commands to call for ads to be merged at the typesetter.andP;  That part isstraightforward.andP;  But OPI doesn't allow for EPS files (the most likely formatfor pre-made-up ads) to be merged in this way; it is primarily for TIFFfiles.andP;  However, typesetters don't care about the format of the files theyare to merge.andM;We raised this issue to several typesetter manufacturers and SCS (since it isthe primary writer of Xtensions for including ad files on PostScript pages).andO;All agreed that the necessary work was relatively simple as long as everyoneagreed to incorporate EPS files using OPI commands, just as if they were TIFFfiles.andM;SCS planned to modify its Xtensions to accommodate this approach by the IFRAshow.andP;  Two typesetter companies--Hyphen and Monotype (via Archetype)--alsoagreed to incorporate this capability by then.andP;  We are sure others willfollow suit.andM;When this capability is finished, we will finally have a very simplealternative for any publication (especially high-end newspapers) that hasbeen plagued by the problem of integrating display ads from company &quot;A&quot; whenpages are produced by company &quot;B.&quot;andM;There is one hitch to all this.andP;  Because it is a PostScript (not a native,proprietary language) solution, it is another reason for publishers to lookto PostScript in the near future as an aid to the difficult integrationproblems of larger systems.andM;Exoterica: SGML to HyperCardandM;Software Exoterica has been demonstating its XGML Translator for severalmonths now, but its latest feat should lay to rest the fears of those whothink SGML means only code-ridden files.andM;As part of its work with Microsoft in putting the Concise Columbia Dictionaryof Quotations into electronic form, Exoterica added generic markup to thefile.andP;  Once it had an SGML file, it used the XGML Translator to createautomatically a HyperCard stack of the quotations.andM;We tried it, and, in fact, Exoterica's stack behaved like any other.andO;Cross-references to other quotes were linked with hot buttons; sequentialcards were reached by selecting arrows--the usual on-screen interface.andM;What was interesting is that the complete stack, which is several megabytesof data, was automatically generated from an ASCII file of content withgeneric markup.andP;  In the source file, there are elements--quotes,cross-references, authors, subjects and so forth--delimited by begin and endtags.andM;Exoterica created with the XGML Translator a script for reading the sourcefile and then generating a stack in HyperTalk.andP;  It turned out to berelatively simple: HyperTalk is an English-like language for event-basedprogramming.andP;  The events are mouse-down and mouse-up.andP;  The XGML Translator isalso an English-like language for event-based programming, but its eventshappen to be start and end tags.andP;  Exoterica read begin and end tags and thentranslated them to HyperTalk commands.andM;Previously, Exoterica had shown how the same type of source file could betranslated using XGML Translator to Microsoft Word, or any other formatter,for producing hard copy.andM;Exoterica has earned the distinction of the leading developer of SGMLsoftware, but the Translator may be its most effective tool yet.andP;  With thisproduct, publishers can reap one of the real benefits of genericmarkup--efficient production of content in various forms.andP;  The demo inHyperCard shows just how open-ended those forms may be.andP;  And to the end user,the lesson is, &quot;Look, Ma, no tags!&quot;andM;US Lynx restructures lineupandM;US Lynx announced version 4.3 of its InterMedia software, complete with somenew formats; a new structure for its CALS-related products; an SGML taggingsystem; a program to convert PCL files to Xerox format; the Intellibasedatabase package; and the ability to convert graphics.andP;  The latter abilityconsists of InterRaster, which converts graphics between two raster formats,and InterVector, which converts between two vector formats.andP;  InterRastersupports IMG, PCX, TIF and CCITT Group 4 formats; InterVector, CGM, EPS, Gemand WMF formats.andM;CALS Converter.andP;  The CALS Converter, which had included the DatalogicsWriterStation, the Parser, the graphics converter and the 1840A Tape Handler,all for a price of $14,950, has been unbundled.andP;  The CALS Converter withoutthose other products now sells for $3,995.andP;  The 1840A Tape Handler, which hadbeen available alone for $3,995, has been reduced to $1,995.andP;  The graphicsconverter lists for $795.andM;Context-Wise.andP;  A new product that has been spun off from the InterMediasystem is Context-Wise, a table-driven SGML tagging system, not an automatictagger.andP;  It converts an existing document to SGML.andP;  Context-Wise provides thegeneral capabilities of the InterMedia system: swapping of tables duringprocessing, based on context cues; running of six tables sequentially in onetagging pass; use of flags, counters, toggles and conditional translations;and so on.andM;Context-Wise sells for $2,950.andM;InterMac.andP;  US Lynx also announced that the InterMac data conversion system,which runs on a Macintosh, is now in production sales.andP;  Previewed a year agoat the Seybold Computer Publishing Exposition, it uses an 80186 card in theMacintosh to run InterMedia software, with translation taking place in theMacintosh.andP;  It runs like any other Macintosh application window.andM;InterMac handles many of the existing InterMedia formats, with additionalones to be offered as requested.andM;InterMac sells for $2,500 with one pair of conversion formats.andP;  Additionalformats cost $300 each.andM;Lynx HPX Driver.andP;  US Lynx announced a program to convert files fromHewlett-Packard PCL format to Xerox Interpress language for output on Xeroxprinters.andP;  Called Lynx HPX Driver, it enables any software application thatcreates files in PCL Level IV (or lower) to print on high-speed Xeroxmachines running Interpress, Publication Set 3.0.andM;The program provides full support for embedded raster graphics, downloadedbitmap fonts and portrait/landscape orientation.andP;  It compensates formismatches in Xerox printer and HP font metrics to retain line endings,columns, decimal points and other key elements in their proper locations.andM;Lynx HPX Driver costs $1,995.andM;Intellibase.andP;  An add-on to the InterMedia system, Intellibase is a databaseprogram and a report generator that supports manipulation of ASCII datawithin a word processing program as well as within the InterMedia system.andP;  Itcan be used to import and export variable-length records and fields, and torun a spelling checker on each field.andP;  It can generate reports and print themor store them as files.andP;  When Intellibase is integrated into the InterMediasystem, reports can be translated immediately for use in publishing systems.andM;Intellibase sells for $1,595.andM;Verity signs with DEC, develops for MacandM;We have covered Topic frequently, so we will only present a brief overviewhere.andP;  It is an archive and retrieval package based on concept retrievaltechnology.andP;  Content-based retrieval provides access to unstructured textdata and allows the user to search for ideas in a document as opposed tomerely key words and phrases.andM;Topic, which consists of the Topic retrieval client and the Topic database,includes a range of options to facilitate data retrieval.andP;  They includeHyperLink connections, a query builder and an interface to SQL databases.andO;The program can retrieve data objects (text, graphics or numeric) across arange of formats in diverse environments including VMS, Ultrix, Unix, DOS andOS/2.andM;Topic is designed for use with large documents on a network.andP;  A newerversion, Topic Realtime, exists for use with dynamic data on a wire serviceor electronic mail.andP;  Topic Realtime builds and maintains informationdatabases from external sources, as required by a group of users.andM;Topic Realtime has filters with router functions; it is essentially a filemanager for incoming stories.andP;  Verity has sold it to many U.S.andP;  newspapers tohandle incoming wire stories.andM;News on Mac, DEC fronts.andP;  At the Exposition, Verity showed Topic 2.2 and aprototype of a corresponding program for the Macintosh, expected next year.andO;The company is also redesigning the user interface to make Topic moreappropriate for casual users to employ as a browse tool, presumably making itmore idiotproof.andM;An announcement was made at the Exposition that Verity has signed withDigital Equipment under its Digital Distributed Software program.andP;  This willallow DEC to distribute the Topic product with support for NetworkApplication Support, DEC's software architecture for application integrationin multivendor networked environments.andM;The new agreement is an addition to other arrangements between DEC andVerity, including a technology licensing arrangement whereby Digital can usethe part of the Verity software for content-based retrieval on DEC systems.andO;Verity is also a Digital Independent Software Vendor and a member of DEC'sRSVP program for product development and comarketing.andP;  Topic supports DEC'sCDA DDIF.andM;The vast potential of the Eastern publishing markets has led many vendors todevelop products that can handle Asian or Arabic fonts.andP;  In addition to thefour listed below, several other firms showed non-Roman publishing productsin San Jose: Bedford, with a Kanji creation facility, and Agfa Compugraphicand Linotype, both of which demonstrated Kanji output (see front cover indexto locate these reviews).andM;Diwan seeks U.S.andP;  pactsandM;We have covered Diwan's CommsNet, NewsNet and Colour PictureNet productsextensively in this report, most recently in connection with their use atArabic newspapers in London (see Vol.andP;  20, No.andP;  1, p. 15).andP;  At theExposition, Diwan showed them for the first time in the U.S.andP;  The company'sprimary objective was to establish some visibility here for its wire serviceproducts, with a view to establishing OEM agreements with U.S.andP;  suppliers.andM;DynaLab Asian fonts proliferateandM;The Taiwanese company DynaLab is a developer of ideographic outline fonts.andO;It made its first U.S.andP;  appearance last March at the Seybold Seminars (seeVol.andP;  19, No.andP;  13, p. 46).andP;  Its software algorithm and proprietary hintingsystem allow it to use minimal memory, so rendering the 20,000 characters ofChinese Hangi, for example, is not a problem.andP;  The technology has become thestandard in Taiwan and DynaLab has significant market share in China, Japanand Korea.andM;DynaFont is a patented stroke-based technology, providing a traditionalapproach to character generation.andP;  Essentially, an algorithm that formsconstructs of Bezier curves is linked to a phonetic keyboard.andP;  The user keysin the phonetic equivalents and the system interprets them to generate theappropriate ideograph or Kanji, using a proprietary hinting system tomaintain the aesthetic quality.andP;  Characters can be rotated, tilted, shadowed,outlined, reversed and pattern masked.andM;The library now has nine Chinese, four Japanese and two Korean typefacesavailable.andP;  They use about 1/10 the memory required by lookup-table-basedsystems.andP;  The stroke-based outline font technology requires about 1.4 MB formore than 13,000 characters instead of the 10 to 20 MB required by otherapproaches.andM;SKW also demonstrated DynaLab's Chinese fonts at the San Jose show.andM;New deals.andP;  In San Jose, DynaLab announced a cooperative agreement wherebyApple will bundle the PostScript versions of four of its fonts (Kai Medium,Ming Light, Ming Heavy, and Hay Medium) with the Asian version of theLaserWriter IINTX laser printer, the NTX-A.andP;  The printer will have a 40-MBhard drive to hold the PostScript fonts.andP;  This software arrangement does notinclude any DynaLab hardware.andP;  Apple's Japanese printer, the NTX-J, has twofonts.andM;DynaLab sells a product consisting of two LSI DL89C-10A chips, which containthe font algorithms, on a PC-compatible board.andP;  Sharp is also using theDynaLab two-chip set to create fonts on the fly in its WD A340 desktopcomputer, also called the Shoin Processor.andP;  This $1,000 device is not yetavailable in the U.S.andP;  or Europe for some reason.andP;  It contains a 8088processor with a VGA-compatible LCD screen with a keyboard, a floppy driveand a thermal transfer plain-paper 400-dpi printer.andM;At the Exposition, DynaLab also showed a Mitac PC clone with the DynaFontchip set to provide an Asian screen image.andM;Expansion plans.andP;  DynaLab is keen to pursue the European market, although ithas no representation yet.andP;  It has set up an information hotline in the U.S.andO;for North American technical support.andP;  It will not sell direct until there isa solid team in the U.S., although part of its long-term strategy will be tosell code to U.S.-based Chinese and Taiwanese magazines.andP;  The cost in thiscase would be $700 plus $30 a month for the software.andP;  DynaLab plans toannounce in Tokyo next month a program to develop thirty new Asian fonts overthe next two years.andP;  The company will work with font houses and users todetermine the priority of these new fonts.andM;Knox shows Japanese under WindowsandM;Knox Computer Systems, of San Diego, demonstrated a new version of its BikanJalm Japanese word processing and publishing program.andP;  Bikan Jalm 2.0 runsunder Microsoft Windows, versions 2 and 3.andP;  It enables users of a variety ofpublishing packages to export Japanese characters in TIFF, EPS and WindowsMetafile formats directly into their applications, either by importing themas text files or through the clipboard.andP;  Data also can be imported andexported in the SHIFT-JIS format (the Japanese equivalent of ASCII).andM;Jalm runs on IBM-compatible PCs with 640K of memory, a floppy drive, a harddisk and Windows 2 or above.andM;As a word processor, it won't raise any eyebrows with its features, but itdoes support block operations by specifying a starting and ending point for ablock and allowing copying, moving and deleting the block.andM;Text can be formatted either horizontally or vertically by selecting theappropriate place in a dialog box.andM;Japanese input.andP;  Characters are input using the standard IBM English keyboardand the standard hiragana, katakana and Romaji basic elements for buildingJapanese sentences, including numbers and Roman characters.andP;  To createJapanese characters, the operator enters Kanji mode and types Roman letters,which are converted to Japanese hiragana characters for display on the topline of the screen.andP;  At any time, the user can press the spacebar to convertthe hiragana characters to Kanji ideographs, where available.andP;  When theRETURN key is struck, the hiragana or Kanji characters are moved from thecommand line into the text area.andM;English text can be entered directly onto the page.andM;A soft preview is available--but a bit slow--to see how the ideographs willlook on output.andP;  The preview display can be scaled by command, but if it isenlarged beyond the size of the screen, then there is no way to scroll toview areas not displayed.andM;Characters are maintained in vector format, which means they can be expanded,condensed and manipulated without losing their attractiveness.andP;  The fontattributes dialog box has a nice preview of its own to show how a characterwill look when its horizontal and vertical dimensions are altered, either inthe same proportions or differently to distort them anamorphically.andM;Four Japanese fonts are available.andM;SKW shows Chinese input, fontsandM;SKW Computers, of Cupertino, California, demonstrated its Chinese/Englishdocument processing software and a database management program supporting thesame languages.andP;  The document software, Art, version 1.5, was notable becauseit uses the outline fonts developed by DynaLab Taiwan (see p. 34).andP;  Thosefonts build ideographic characters from a set of basic strokes, rather thanstoring entire characters.andP;  The result is a saving in memory and diskstorage.andM;Art 1.5, which was developed from a Japanese product called Yukata Art, is aversatile program, encompassing input, processing and layout of Chinese andEnglish text, plus extensive graphics capabilities.andP;  It runs on a PC with anEten Chinese system board and 640K of main memory.andP;  A hard disk isrecommended.andM;The software supports integrated programs both for drawing and for pixelediting of scanned images.andP;  A soft-copy preview of text and graphics in pageformat is available.andP;  Output is in SKW's proprietary format, not PostScript.andO;Drivers exist for the HP LaserJet and for various dot-matrix and ink-jetprinters.andP;  Six Chinese fonts are available.andP;  Art 1.5 supports three commonmethods of inputing Chinese characters.andP;  One way involves typing the 26letters of the English alphabet in various combinations to create a set ofpossible Chinese ideographs.andP;  If the operator also specifies the tone (fromamong four in the language), the number of possible Chinese characters isreduced.andM;The other methods are Chungji, which builds Chinese ideographs from 24 basecharacters, and one used in Mandarin Chinese only, which starts with 37elements (26 letters plus the top row on an English keyboard) and also allowsspecification of four tones.andM;With these systems, the operator types the building blocks at the bottom ofthe screen (see photo), after which the possible ideographs are displayedabove for the operator to select one.andP;  About 13,000 ideographs are accessiblefrom the keyboard in this fashion.andP;  The user can add others.andM;As a word processor, the program provides context-sensitive function keys,providing, among other things, nice facilities for defining blocks and movingor copying them, plus seven keys for changing character sizes to generatesub- and superscripts, reduced-width (50%) characters, etc.andP;  An undo functionreturns step by step as far back as memory allows.andP;  For composing text inboxes, the program automatically sizes the box to fit the amount of text.andM;We worked a little with the draw functions, which enable selection of brushsizes, fill patterns and colors (one each for the foreground and background)and addition of text to an object.andP;  An undo function reverts one step back inthe process.andM;The database program, called FMS, generates lists, merges multiple files forreports or invoices, imports Lotus spreadsheets and so on.andM;SKW is a U.S.andP;  company that developed these products and has U.S.andP;  marketingrights.andP;  Formed in October 1989, it has a staff of five in engineering andmarketing.andP;  In Taiwan, a company called Aurosoft has sales rights.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
