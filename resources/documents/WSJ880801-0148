Bass Group Inc. to acquire deeply troubled American Savings andamp; Loan Association with as much as $2.2 billion in federal aid, officials familiar with the negotiations said.    Negotiators for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board hope to hammer out final terms of the proposed transaction and present them to the three Bank Board members this week, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.    Under terms currently being discussed, the officials said, Fort Worth, Texas-based Bass Group would inject $550 million in new capital into American Savings, a unit of Financial Corp. of America, based in Irvine, Calif. American Savings would be stripped of its bad loans, real estate and huge portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.    Those assets would be placed in a separate unit. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. would agree to pay for certain losses of that unit under various formulas. The payments are estimated to be $1.5 billion over 10 years if interest rates remain relatively flat, or as much as $2.2 billion if rates rise sharply during that time, the officials said.    In return, the FSLIC will receive warrants representing a 30% interest in the holding company set up by Bass Group that is likely to own both the cleansed American Savings and the unit that will hold the troubled assets. That stake eventually could provide the FSLIC with significant income.    One big question that remains unresolved, the officials said, is whether the Bank Board will provide any compensation to American Savings' parent, Financial Corp., or its shareholders.    On Friday, the Bank Board announced that it extended until Sept. 1 an agreement to negotiate exclusively with Bass Group for the rescue of American Savings, which has assets of $30 billion and is the nation's second-largest thrift.    The exclusive negotiating agreement was set to expire today. The extension was the second since the agreement began on April 21. In both cases, the Bank Board said the agreement was extended because of &quot;substantial progress&quot; in the negotiations.    &quot;These have been complex negotiations, and the staff has worked out most of the economic terms,&quot; Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said in a statement issued late Friday. &quot;However, there are other details to work out and documents to complete and we as a board need time to carefully review the final recommendations from our staff.&quot;    Officials familiar with the negotiations said both sides worked feverishly in recent days to try to meet the Aug. 1 deadline.    On Friday, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Bank Board member Roger Martin, who headed the board's efforts to resolve American Savings' problems, said the amount of FSLIC assistance would range from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. Mr. Martin also said Bass Group would inject $550 million in cash into American Savings, the newspaper said.    Officials familiar with the negotiations previously had said the FSLIC assistance would be at least $1.5 billion, and that Bass Group would inject several hundred million dollars of new capital into American Savings.    A Bank Board spokesman declined to comment on the Star-Telegram report or to discuss any details of the negotiations. In an interview with this newspaper on Friday, Mr. Martin declined to discuss the amount of FSLIC assistance or new capital involved in the American Savings talks.    Mr. Martin hasn't been involved in the recent, detailed talks with Bass Group, which have been handled by FSLIC and Bank Board staff members. However, the staff members have been instructed by the Bank Board to negotiate a transaction that falls within the range Mr. Martin described, officials said.    American Savings, struggling with a huge portfolio of soured loans and foreclosed real estate, has been a major headache for the Bank Board since 1984. As of March 31, American Savings' liabilities exceeded its assets by $212 million. Financial Corp. is expected to report a second-quarter loss within the next two weeks.    The Bank Board is under pressure on two fronts to complete a rescue of American Savings quickly. Despite an unprecedented guarantee by the Bank Board that all depositors in American Savings will be paid in full, the thrift had a net deposit outflow of nearly $1 billion during the second quarter. That outflow represented about 6% of American Savings' $16.36 billion of deposits at the start of the quarter.    American Savings officials say the rate of outflow diminished recently, but analysts say such an outflow is cause for concern.    In addition, the Bank Board must complete a deal for American Savings by Dec. 31 to take advantage of certain tax breaks for acquirers of failed thrifts. If a transaction doesn't qualify for those tax breaks, it would significantly increase the amount of assistance the FSLIC will have to pay an acquirer. </TEXT></DOC>
