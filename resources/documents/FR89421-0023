These action levels announcedthe amount of a particular added contaminant that FDA regarded as resultingin adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)).That section provides that a food is adulterated if it bears or containsan added poisonous or deleterious substance that ``may render (the food)injurious to health.'' In <T3>Young</T3> v. <T3>CNI</T3>, 106 S. Ct. 2360 (1986), reversing <T3>CNI </T3>v. <T3>Young</T3> 757 F.2d 354 (D.C. Cir. 1985), the Supreme Court decidedthat FDA has the discretion to regulate such substances either by (1) exercisingits prosecutorial discretion to recommend court proceedings under section402(a)(1) of the act, guided by informal action levels, or (2) issuingtolerances by formal rulemaking under sections 406 and 701(e) of the act(21 U.S.C. 346 and 371(e)). The Supreme Court found that the question whetheraction levels must be promulgated by notice and comment (informal) rulemakingunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) was not beforeit (106 S. Ct. at 2364), and therefore remanded the case to the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for decision on that issue.On May 15, 1987, the D.C. Circuit held that FDA action levels are legislativerules rather than general statements of policy within the meaning of theAPA (5 U.S.C. 551(5)) and, therefore, must be promulgated in accordancewith the notice and comment procedures of that statute (<T3>CNI</T3> v. <T3>Young</T3>, 818 F.2d 943 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). Because FDA's action levelswere issued without such procedures, the court found the action levelsto be ``invalid.'' <T3>Id</T3>. at 950.On June 29, 1987, the government filed a petition for rehearing with suggestionfor rehearing <T3>en banc</T3> in the case. On October 15, 1987, the circuit court deniedthe <T3>en banc</T3> suggestion without dissent. On the same date, the petitionfor panel rehearing was denied. The government did not seek <T3>certiorari</T3>.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 19, 1988 (53 FR 5043), in responseto the circuit court's decision, FDA issued a notice stating that its currentaction levels are not binding on the courts, the public (including foodproducers), or the agency (including individual FDA employees), and thatthe action levels do not have the ``force of law'' of substantive rules.The notice said that if a food bears or contains an unavoidable added poisonousor deleterious substance in an amount below the action level for that substance,FDA is not precluded from recommending to the Department of Justice (see21 U.S.C. 337; <T3>Ewing</T3> v. <T3>Mytinger andamp; Casselberry, Inc.</T3>, 339 U.S. 594, 598-99 (1950))that court enforcement action be instituted against the food or the personsresponsible for its shipment, and the government is not barred from bringingsuch an action. Action levels do not create a legal immunity from prosecutionfor food producers, nor do action levels grant to food producers a legalprivilege to ship in interstate commerce food with added contaminants upto the applicable action levels. At the same time, as stated in the notice,if a food bears or contains an unavoidable poisonous or deleterious substancein an amount in excess of the action level for that substance, FDA is notrequired to recommend court proceedings, and the government is not requiredto bring such proceedings. Whether FDA will recommend, and the governmentwill institute, seizure, injunction, or prosecution in a given case willdepend on the extent of the contamination, the strength of the evidenceof adulteration within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, therisk to health presented by the unavoidable added poisonous or deleterioussubstance, the amount of food involved, and other factors.In the February 19, 1988, notice, FDA also stated that it would publisha proposed rule to (1) amend its regulations creating and describing actionlevels to make it clear that action levels constitute prosecutorial guidancerather than substantive rules, and (2) revoke the provisions of the regulationsproviding for exemptions to action levels in 21 CFR Parts 109 (human food)and 509 (animal feed), because the circuit court relied on those regulationsand provisions in determining that the action levels were substantive rules.<T3>CNI </T3>v. <T3>Young</T3>, 818 F.2d at 847, quoting 21 CFR 109.4, 109.6(c), and 109.8(a).FDA is proposing to amend 21 CFR 109.4(b)(1) and 21 CFR 509.4(b)(1) byproviding that an action level define a level of contamination at whichthe agency may regard a food as adulterated. An action level would no longerbe defined as ``the level of contamination at which a food will be deemedto be adulterated.'' FDA is also proposing to amend andSection; 109.4(b)(1)andSection; 509.4(b)(1) be deleting the last sentence, which provides that``an action level may prohibit any detectable amount of the substance infood.'' These proposed amendments are intended to make it clear that actionlevels do not have a present effect and are not binding.FDA is proposing to amend andSection; 109.4(b)(2) and andSection; 509.4(b)(2)by deleting the following sentences:<ITAG tagnum="21">Regulatory action may be taken at any time after an action level isestablished, and need not await publication of the notice. An action levelmay be changed at any time if the protection of the public health so requires.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The agency is proposing to delete these sentences because they suggestedthat action levels are binding and because they attach to action levelsa degree of formality that is neither necessary nor appropriate. As indicatedin the February 19, 1988, notice, action levels are merely prosecutorialguidelines. Regulatory action may therefore be taken whether or not anaction level has been established, and an action level may be changed forany appropriate reason.FDA is proposing to amend andSection; 109.6(c) and andSection; 509.6(c) intwo respects. First, consistent with the proposed amendments to andSection;109.4(b) (1) and (2) and andSection; 509.4(b) (1) and (2), discussed above,the agency is proposing to delete from the second sentence of andSection;109.6(c) and andSection; 509.6(c) the phrase ``shall cease to be enforcedand,'' because that phrase suggests that action levels have a present effectand are binding. Second, FDA is proposing to amend the first sentence ofandSection; 109.6(c) and andSection; 509.6(c) to provide that an action levelfor an added poisonous or deleterious substance in a food (or feed) maybe established at a level at which FDA may regard the food (or feed) asadulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, withoutregard to the criteria in section 406 of the act or andSection; 109.6 orandSection; 509.6 of the agency's regulations. FDA has established actionlevels in the past to aid in enforcing section 402(a)(1) of the act, andthe agency is proposing to reflect that practice in its regulations.FDA is not proposing at this time any other amendments to andSection; 109.6or andSection; 509.6. The agency emphasizes, however, that an action levelestablished using the criteria in current andSection; 109.6 or andSection;509.6 is not the functional equivalent of a tolerance established by formalrulemaking under sections 406 and 701(e) of the act. The administrativestandard represented by an action level as opposed to such a toleranceis entirely different in legal effect, for an action level does not bindthe courts, the public (including food producers), or FDA (including individualagency employees).Finally, FDA is proposing to delete andSection; 109.8 and andSection; 509.8in their entirety. These provisions provided for exemptions to action levelsand, in the circuit court's view, confirmed that action levels were ``presentlybinding norm[s].'' <T3>CNI </T3>v. <T3>Young</T3>, 818 F.2d at 847. The agency emphasizes, however, that notwithstandingany deletion of andSection; 109.8 and andSection; 509.8, FDA ``enjoys completediscretion not to employ the enforcement provisions'' of the act. <T3>CNI</T3> v. <T3>Young</T3>, 818 F.2d at 950, citing <T3>Heckler</T3> v. <T3>Chaney</T3>, 470 U.S. 821 (1985). Those ``provisions authorize, butdo not compel, FDA to undertake enforcement activity; they `commit completediscretion to [FDA] to decide how and when they should be exercised.' ''<T3>Schering Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Hekcler</T3> 779 F.2d 683, 686 (D.C. Cir. 1985), quoting <T3>Heckler </T3>v. <T3>Chaney</T3>, 470 U.S. at 835.FDA notes that if it were to establish, by notice-and-comment rulemakingunder sections 402(a)(1) and 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1) and371(a)), levels of added poisonous and deleterious substances in food thatmay render the food injurious to health, those levels would be bindingon the courts, the public (including food producers), and the agency (includingindividual FDA employees). If the agency establishes such levels, it willcall them regulatory limits, to eliminate the possibility of confusionover the legal effect of action levels, as defined in this proposal, andbinding regulatory limits promulgated by informal rulemaking under sections402(a)(1) and 701(a) of the act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>FDA has determined that this action is of a type that is categoricallyexcluded under andSection; 25.24(a)(8) of the agency's regulations governingenvironmental impact considerations (21 CFR 25.24(a)(8)). Therefore, neitheran environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Impact</ITAG>The agency has examined the regulatory impact and regulatory flexibilityimplications of the proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 12291and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). The agency finds thatthe proposed rule is not a major rule because the revisions proposed wouldnot result in any increase in cost (significant or otherwise) to the public(including food producers). The proposal would amend the agency's regulationscreating and describing action levels for added poisonous or deleterioussubstances, such as aflatoxins in corn, to make it clear that action levelsconstitute prosecutorial guidance rather than substantive rules. The agencyis also proposing to revoke the provisions of the regulations providingfor exceptions to action levels since there would be no need to providefor an exception to an action level that does not bind the courts, thepublic (including food producers), or the agency (including individualagency employees). Thus, the proposal creates no new requirements for foodproducers. For these reasons, therefore, the agency has determined thatthe proposed rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291.Further, FDA certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Interested persons may, on or before June 20, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal.Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy.
