In a brief departure statement after three days in Damascus, AliAkbar Velayati said his visit was ``very successful and useful.''   He had a final meeting Wednesday with Farouk al-Sharaa, theSyrian foreign minister, but there was no immediate indication ofwhat they discussed.   Sixteen Western captives are held in Lebanon, half of themAmericans. Most are believed in the hands of Shiite Moslem factionssponsored by Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is loyal to Iran.   After meeting with Sharaa on Tuesday, Velayati told reporters``our talks with our Syrian brothers will not have anything to dowith the hostage issue, since this issue does not concern us.''   He said the visit to Syria was linked to fighting betweenChristian army units and Syrian soldiers in Lebanon, but officialSyrian media had indicated President Hafez Assad was pressing theIranians for action on the hostages.   Syria, Iran's main Arab ally, has been instrumental in pasthostage releases and promised the United States to help resolve thecrisis that began with Israel's abduction July 28 of Sheik AbdulKarim Obeid, a Shiite cleric in south Lebanon.   In Vienna, President Kurt Waldheim's office said Waldheim had amessage from Assad saying the captors of Joseph Cicippio had assuredhim the American hostage's life would not be threatened again.   Assad also pledged to help obtain the release of all hostages inthe Middle East ``for humanitarian reasons'' and condemned thekilling of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins as a ``crime againsthumanity,'' said a statement from the office.   Kidnappers holding Higgins, a U.S. Marine who was on U.N. duty insouth Lebanon when abducted in February 1988, said they hanged himJuly 31, three days after Obeid was kidnapped. Cicippio's life wasthreatened, but his captors said they had suspended the deathsentence.   Velayati delivered a letter to Assad from President HashemiRafsanjani of Iran, who has indicated willingness to discuss thehostage question with the United States, but the contents were notdisclosed. The foreign minister said his talks in Syria centered on``regional matters and bilateral cooperation.''   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and hundreds of other LebaneseShiite prisoners for three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon and allthe Western hostages.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
