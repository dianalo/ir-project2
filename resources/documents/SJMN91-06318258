Retailers were not so sure.;   &quot;The chair at one of ouropening grades of fabric is $520, and the slipcover is $300; you get twochairs for the price of one,&quot; said Kathy Davis, assistant to the president ofLexington Furniture Industries, about the advantages of buying agreen-and-white gingham check slipcover in addition to the bright floral chairin the new Week-End Retreat Collection.;   &quot;It's the look, but also it isfunctional because it allows seasonal changes,&quot; said a representative forBernhardt Furniture, which offered 19 different sofa frames, each upholsteredin muslin, with a choice of 30 fabrics for slipcovers.;   While retailers suchas John T. Plunkett, president of the Drexel Heritage Showcases by Plunkettstores, remained non-committal, others rejected it soundly.;   &quot;What's next,plastic coverings?&quot; a trade journalist asked.;   &quot;Maybe it will sell inChicago,&quot; said a South Dakota retailer, &quot;but my customers in Rapid City won'tbuy it.&quot;;   These are tough economic times for most furniture retailers andmanufacturers. Total U.S. furniture sales have fallen since the peak year of1989. Most are searching for new products to interest consumers, and few arewilling to stray too far from what seems to be selling.;   New upholsteredintroductions for spring 1992 did not change much in shape or color palettefrom those already available. Instead, manufacturers borrowed the slouchyslipcover idea to suggest a casual, comfortably worn gentility equivalent tothe distressed and pre-washed clothing so popular in fashion.;   Lexington andseveral other producers promoted slipcovers over already upholstered pieces asa change of pace, according to the consumer's mood. Drexel Heritage, whichoffered two sofa shapes and a choice of 1,200 fabrics, and Bernhardt showedslipcovers as the primary covering for sofa frames. The reason, said a Drexelrepresentative, is that two upholstered fabrics rubbing against each otherwear unevenly.;   Prices for the slipcovers are about 25 percent of a piece,although the percentage seems to go up on less expensive furniture. AtBauhaus, for example, starter sofas are $400 and slipcovers are $200. AtDrexel Heritage, slipcovers begin at $500, a price one retailer called&quot;relatively affordable on a several-thousand-dollar sofa.&quot;;   Judging by thereactions of market-goers, this is one style with a generation gap.;   People40 years old and under find slipcovers a new look and a nifty added option.One company's young spokeswoman, the mother of a young child, insisted, &quot;I'dlove to have one (slipcover) to throw over the sofa when company comes.&quot;;  Veteran retailers and others over 40, however, seemed more inclined toassociate slipcovers with the shortage-plagued Depression and World War IIera.;   Steering the midcourse were a number of introductions with loose,sometimes vintage-looking fabrics permanently attached to a frame. Among themost dramatic was a sofa with boxy sides and squishy cushions covered with awrinkly, natural-linen-look fabric at Drexel Heritage.;   Ironically, RalphLauren, to whom this slipcover dilemma might be traced because of hispopularization of English country-manor-style furnishings, introduced hiscontemporary modular furniture.;   For another change of pace from the manyvariations of flowers, stripes and Indian fabric patterns that apparently willsuffuse home stores in the spring, look for a smattering of 1940s-styleHollywood Chic motifs.;   Not the sort of style most people can take inroom-size doses, they nevertheless provide a smile for boldness and are anoption as a dramatic accent. One of the more popular was a largepalm-leaf-pattern fabric used to great effect by designer John Mascheroni on acircular contemporary chair for Swaim.;   Sticking strictly to functionalpurchases for the home? Then consider the newest multipurpose piece offurniture, an upholstered ottoman-cocktail table shown by Hammary FurnitureCo., Thomasville, Ralph Lauren and others.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SHARON STANGENES, Chicago Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  High Point, N.C.  </CITY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  695  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 13, 199100318258,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
