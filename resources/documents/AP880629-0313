(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ardshiel Inc., a New York investment firm,said it withdrew its $695 million takeover offer for Quaker StateCorp. in part because the motor oil company ignored the proposal.   ``We had hoped (to) put leverage on them to talk to us, but theymaintained their policy of silence,'' Dennis McCormick, an Ardshielsenior managing partner, said Tuesday.   ``It may not be the end of the game,'' he said. ``We like thecompany, and we believe we have some good ideas for it.''   McCormick said Ardshiel ``looked at all our options, and for alot of reasons, we decided just to step back from the situation.''   Ardshiel said its April 8 offer of $26.50 a share hinged onapproval from the Quaker State board, without which a hostilesuitor would need approval of 95 percent of the outstanding sharesunder Quaker State's bylaws.   McCormick declined to say whether Ardshiel officials haveconsidered a hostile takeover.   The investors said they had intended to maintain Quaker State'score businesses, which are producing engine lubricants and changingmotor oil at a chain of fast-service shops.   Quaker State, the nation's second-largest motor oil producer,employs about 6,500 workers, including 450 people at itsheadquarters and research center in Oil City.
