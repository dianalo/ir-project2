 Using such attributes as afocus, each poll then attempts to measure buyer satisfaction with a group ofproducts in a particular category.andM;It is important to note that these polls are not intended to provide orreplace benchmark-type data (best obtained from conventional product reviews)or specification-sheet data (best obtained from comprehensive buyers'guides).andP;  Rather, PC Week Polls strive to gather data on corporatesatisfaction with those product characteristics that cannot be measured bybenchmark tests or found in product-specification sheets, particularly thoserelated to a product's ability to function in real-life workplaces.andM;How the Polls Are ConductedandM;Product categories are surveyed in clusters to take advantage of likelyoverlap in product usage by respondents.andP;  Each poll focuses on a limitednumber of brands in a product category, including market leaders and otherbrands selected as noteworthy by PC Week's editorial staff.andM;Respondents' ratings of a given brand are based on a series of productattributes related to that product category.andP;  For each category, lists of sixto 12 such attributes are selected by PC Week's editorial research departmentin consultation with other editorial personnel.andM;Besides rating specific products on the basis of these attributes,respondents are asked to rate the importance of the attributes as theygenerally relate to that product category.andP;  Each survey also asks respondentsto cite their installed base for each product and to rate only those brandsinstalled at their sites for at least three months.andM;Survey mailing lists for each product group are obtained from both the PCWeek subscriber file and vendor lists.andP;  Except for an inconspicuous codingsymbol on the surveys mailed to vendor-supplied respondents, identicalquestionnaires are mailed both to vendor-supplied respondents and PC Weeksubscribers.andM;Subscriber lists (with at least 1,000 names per product category) are drawnon an nth-name basis from among those subscribers self-identified as havingpurchase involvement with the product category being surveyed.andM;The only subscribers excluded from such mailing lists are thoseself-identified as computer-equipment manufacturers, distributors orVARs/VADs.andP;  Research-department staffers also scan all mailing labels priorto mailing for computer-equipment manufacturers, distributors, value-addedresellers (VARs) or value-added dealers (VADs) inadvertently self-identifiedas unaffiliated with the computer industry.andP;  No additional criteria are usedin selecting subscribers for mailing lists.andM;For each brand initially selected for inclusion in a survey, its manufactureris requested, via certified letter, to supply PC Week with a random list of150 to 250 corporate or institutional customers who have purchased thatproduct at least five months earlier.andP;  A time limit of three weeks from thereceipt of the letter by the vendor is imposed for the return of mailinglists to PC Week.andM;Vendors are also required to submit to PC Week a formal, writtencertification that they will not contact these customers regarding thesurvey.andP;  (Upon request, PC Week will supply participating vendors withwritten certification of PC Week's intention to use vendor-supplied customerlists only for the purposes of the PC Week Poll.)andM;To encourage maximum vendor involvement as well as to guarantee that allinvited vendors have ample opportunity to participate, research-departmentpersonnel telephone those who did not respond to the certified letter.andP;  Ifthe marketing manager (or other suitable representative) cannot be reached atthat time, at least three additional efforts are routinely made.andM;For data on a specific brand to be reported in a poll, completedquestionnaires concerning that brand must be received from a minimum of 25qualified respondents.andP;  Such respondents can be either PC Week subscribers orvendor-provided corporate customers, with the latter accounting for a maximumof 70 percent of the respondents for each brand.andM;To enhance vendor cooperation in providing mailing lists to PC Week and toprovide useful feedback for PC Week subscribers, we publish the names of allproducts whose manufacturers did not supply PC Week with customer lists andfor which we could not find the minimum number of 25 respondents.andM;Calculation of Product ScoresandM;For each brand rated in a PC Week Poll, an average respondent rating iscomputed for each attribute surveyed.andP;  An average respondent rating is alsocomputed for each attribute as it relates to that entire product category.andM;To produce final ratings for each brand, PC Week calculates a weightingfactor for each attribute that reflects the relative importance of thatattribute compared with all other attributes in that product category.andP;  Theseweighting factors are then used to calculate weighted attribute scores foreach brand.andP;  A brand's final rating is equal to the arithmetic average ofthese weighted attribute scores.andM;For any surveyed brand whose vendor supplies a mailing list to PC Week, ourresearch department compares the average final scores awarded to that brandby vendor-supplied respondents to the average final scores awarded by PC Weeksubscribers.andM;Where differences of statistical significance favoring a brand are found tohave been awarded by respondents supplied by its vendor, only non-vendor datawill be used to calculate that brand's scores, provided PC Week has receiveddata from at least 25 non-vendor respondents.andP;  If PC Week does not have datafrom at least 25 non-vendor respondents, scores for that product arewithdrawn from publication.andM;In addition to the minimum response rate of 25 responses per brand, arequired minimum number of installed units per brand is also determined foreach product category.andP;  Unit minimums are established by the researchdepartment and vary from product category to product category, based on twobroad considerations: the relative likelihood of unit-by-unit manufacturingunevenness for a given category, and the relative degree of unit penetrationfor a category into the marketplace.andP;  The minimum number of installed unitsrequired for a particular product category will always be indicated in thepublished results of that PC Week Poll.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
