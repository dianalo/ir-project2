Background</ITAG>Legislation to authorize Enterprise Zones has been a goal of the Administrationsince its inception. Since 1982, several Enterprise Zone Bills have beenintroduced on behalf of the Administration, providing significant tax incentivesas well as the potential for waiver of Federal regulations. In his 1988 Legislative Message, President Reagan stated: ``More than halfof the states have set up their own enterprise zones, even without Federalincentives. These zones have created new jobs and spurred billions of dollarsin capital investment. Their success is testimony to the power of thisconcept and is just a small indication of how much could be accomplishedif Federal incentives were added to those of States and localities. AddingFederal incentives would make existing zones far more economically attractiveand successful and would also encourage more State and local zones. Accordingly,I am renewing my call to the Congress to take up effective Federal EnterpriseZone legislation which will complement the State Programs.'' The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 included Title VII, EnterpriseZone Development as a new program. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Program Description</ITAG>GeneralThe Secretary of HUD may designate up to 100 Enterprise Zones. One thirdof the Enterprise Zones must be in rural areas.Designation of the Enterprise Zones will be based solely on the rank orderof distress of the zones. The only exception will be if the Secretary determinesthat the Course of Action proposed for the area is inadequate.EligibilityTo be eligible for zone designation, the area must:(1) Have a continuous boundary and a minimum population of 4,000 if locatedin a metropolitan statistical area or in a jurisdiction with a populationof 50,000 or greater, or 1,000 if located in a rural area, or any populationif located entirely in an Indian Reservation;(2) Be located in a UDAG eligible jurisdiction; and(3) Be of pervasive poverty, unemployment and general distress.In addition, an urban area must have:(1) An unemployment rate of at least 1.5 times the national unemploymentrate;(2) A poverty rate of at least 20 percent; and either(3) Low income or population decline:(a) Have at least 70 percent of the households with incomes below 80 percentof the median income of households of the local jurisdiction; or(b) Have a population decline of 20 percent or more between 1970 and 1980.A rural area must meet at least one of the four criteria enumerated in1, 2, 3(a), and 3(b).Designation ProcessA local and State Government must jointly request designation of an areawhich they certify meets the eligibility requirements.The nomination request must include a ``Course of Action'' which has beendeveloped to reduce the various burdens borne by employers or employeesin the area. The Course of Action must include at least four of the following:A reduction of tax rates or fees applying within the enterprise zone;An increase in the level of public services, or in the efficiency of thedelivery of public services within the enterprise zone;Actions to reduce, remove, simplify or streamline paperwork requirementswithin the enterprise zone;Involvement in the program by public authorities or private entities, organizations,neighborhood associations and community groups, particularly those withinthe nominated area, including a written commitment to provide jobs andjob training for, and technical, financial, or other assistance to, employers,employees and residents of the nominated area;The giving of special contract preference to businesses owned and operatedby members of any minority; andThe gift (or sale at below fair market value) of surplus land in the enterprisezone to neighborhood organizations agreeing to operate a business on theland.Enterprise Zone BenefitsThe Secretary of HUD is authorized to waive HUD regulations in designatedzones and shall:1. Promote the coordination of all HUD Programs in Enterprise Zones; and2. Expedite the consideration of HUD programs in Enterprise Zones.Special IssueNo guidance is provided in the Act with regard to the Enterprise Zone benefitsdiscussed as ``Coordination of Housing and Urban Development Programs inEnterprise Zones.'' The Department intends to be expansive in its applicationof this provision and is interested in specific comments in all three areas:e.g. which regulations impede the achievement of Enterprise Zone objectivesand should be considered for possible waiver? Which programs have the mostpotential for facilitating Enterprise Zone objectives and should receiveexpedited consideration and coordination? In what manner should this expeditedconsideration and coordination be carried out?<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comment</ITAG>The proposed rule will provide the opportunity for the public to commenton the specifics of the Department's intentions to administer the provisionsof this title.Under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act,42 U.S.C. 3535(o) no rule promulgated by the Department may become effectiveuntil after passage of the first period of 30 calendar days of continuoussession of Congress after the day on which the rule is published as final.This section 7(o) constraint of the Congressional calendar applies forthe rest of the year.Section 701(a)(4)(A) of the Act requires that HUD issue regulations addressingthe enterprise zone requirements not later than four months following thedate of enactment of the Act. Given this Congressional mandate to implementthe program expeditiously, and the section 7(o) restraints described above,the comment period provided for this rule is limited to 30 days to permittime for review of the public comments and development of a final ruleat least 30 days before Congress adjourns for the year.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection and copying during regular business hours in the Office of theRules Docket Clerk, Room 10278, 451 Seventh Street SW. Washington, DC 20410This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulation issued bythe President of February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicated thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovations, or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic exportmarkets. If Congress passes tax legislation to augment the authority underwhich this rule is promulgated, the implementing rule for such legislationwould constitute a major economic impact and the Department would preparea Regulatory Impact Analysis at that time.The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). The OMB controlnumber, when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. While the Enterprise Zone Programwill permit small entities to apply for designation and to benefit fromtheir participation in the program, the impact on these entities is a functionof the operation of Title VII of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987, and is not caused by the rulemaking, which merely providesthe machinery for designations of zones under the statutory criteria.This rule is not listed in the Department's semiannual agenda of regulationspublished on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854), under Executive Order 12291and the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 49 FR 15960.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 596</ITAG>Enterprise zones, Economic development, Housing and urban development,Community development.Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 24 of the Codeof Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended by adding a new part 596,as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 596_ENTERPRISE ZONE DEVELOPMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.1 Applicability and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.2 Objective and purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.4 Secretarial review and enterprise zone designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.5 Waivers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.6 Consultation with other Federal agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Area Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.100 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.101 Eligibility requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_State and Local Government Actions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.200 Nominations by State and local governments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.201 Nomination of Indian reservations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.202 Course of action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Zone Designation Process</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.300 Nomination for designation of an enterprise zone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.301 HUD action and review of nominations for zone designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.302 Selection factors for designation of nominated zones.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.303 Zone designation of rural areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.304 Number of zones designated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Post Zone Designation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.400 Monitoring [Reserved].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.401 Revocation of enterprise zone designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.402 Evaluation and reporting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Waiver or Modification of Rules</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.500 Requests for waivers or modifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.501 Waiver or modification of HUD rules in enterprise zones.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Coordination of Housing and Urban Development Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.600 Coordination of HUD programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Title VII, Housing and Community Development Act of1987 (42 U.S.C. 11501-11505); sec. 7(d), Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 596.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability and scope.</ITAG>(a) This part covers policies and procedures applicable to enterprise zonesauthorized under Title VII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of1987 (Pub.

The povertyrate shall be described by citing nationally and locally available statisticson poverty. The unemployment situation shall be demonstrated through provisionof information on job loss, plant closings, or other unemployment indicatorswhich have affected the area.(2) <T3>General distress. </T3>The area must be an area of general distress.General distress shall be evidenced by describing conditions of distressexisting within the area, other than those of poverty and unemployment,such as abandoned housing, infrastructure deficiencies, or other appropriateindicators of conditions of general distress. (d) <T3>Tests for unemployment, poverty, low income, or population loss. </T3>Anominated enterprise zone in an urban area must meet the requirements ofunemployment and poverty, and either low income or population loss. Thedata used to make tests will be expressed to the nearest tenth of a percent.The criteria are as follows: (1) <T3>Unemployment. </T3>The unemployment rate for the smallest number ofblock groups or enumeration districts which entirely contain the nominatedenterprise zone must be at least one and one half times the national ratefor the same period. Unemployment will be based upon decennial census dataadjusted by the most recently available annual average unemployment estimatesfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the smallest jurisdiction whichincludes the nominated zone. (2) <T3>Poverty. </T3>The poverty rate for each census tract that containsany part of the nominated enterprise zone must be at least 20 percent underthe most recent available census data. If census tracts are not defined,evidence of the 20 percent rate of poverty is required at the equivalentcounty division as defined by the Bureau of the Census for the purposeof defining poverty areas. The poverty rate will be determined using theestimated number of persons in families or as unrelated individuals whohad incomes below the poverty thresholds for the decennial census. Censustracts (or other comparable areas) containing fewer than 100 persons asof the decennial census will not be tested under andSection; 596.101(c)(1)and (d)(2); (3) <T3>Low income. </T3>For the smallest number of block groups or enumerationdistricts which entirely contain the nominated enterprise zone, at least70 percent of the households must be below 80 percent of the median householdincome for the local government(s). The percent of households below 80percent of median income is interpolated using decennial census tableswhich show the number of households in various income intervals. In thecase of a joint application, each part of the zone must meet the 80 percentof median income criterion for its jurisdiction; or, (4) <T3>Population loss. </T3>There must be at least a 20 percent populationloss from 1970 to 1980. The 1970 population will be based on the smallestgroup of census areas for which data are available and which entirely containthe zone.
