In a reversal from previous statements, Prodigy executivesalso called unacceptable an anti-Semitic message that figuredlarge in complaints against Prodigy by the Anti-DefamationLeague. In two letters and a meeting with the ADL, and ininterviews this week, Prodigy had defended carrying the note,which said &quot;Hitler had some valid points&quot; and observed ofpogroms and the Holocaust: Jews &quot;only get what they so richlydeserve.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday Prodigy said it has determined it never publiclycarried that note, a statement the ADL accepted. In fact,said Prodigy, it rejected the note 15 times for publicposting. &quot;The truth is we didn't post it then and we wouldn'tpost it now,&quot; said Prodigy Senior Vice President HenryHeilbrunn.   &quot;Obviously these anti-Semitic statements . . . weregrossly repugnant, and that is why they were rejected,&quot; hesaid.   The ADL said the Hitler note was one of a dozen messagesit received in a complaint from a teacher it wouldn'tidentify. Jeffrey Sinensky, director of the ADL's civilrights division, said the ADL had asked the teacher to sendexamples of offensive public messages.   Mr. Sinensky said the ADL checked back with the teacherand now believes the Hitler note was a privateperson-to-person electronic message that was forwarded by therecipient to the teacher via Prodigy. The teacherinadvertently included it among the public messages he sentthe ADL, Mr. Sinensky said. He said the teacher's mailingincluded several other messages that Prodigy confirmed werepublicly posted, and said he has no reason to suspect thatthe teacher tried to mislead the ADL.   Prodigy's position on expressions of anti-Semitism stirredcontroversy because it has an explicit policy banning its 1.1million members from posting public messages that are&quot;obscene, profane or otherwise offensive references.&quot;   When Prodigy said earlier this week that its policy wouldpermit the note about Hitler and the Holocaust, it drewcriticism from the ADL. Prodigy defended its position bysaying its policy concerned offensive messages directed at anindividual, not a group.   In a news conference in New York, Prodigy officials saidthe company has &quot;amplified&quot; its definition of &quot;offensive,&quot;and will immediately promulgate its new guidelines over itsnetwork.   ADL officials hailed Prodigy's broader definition. Butthey said they were mystified that in earlier letters andmeetings Prodigy never voiced any criticism of the quoteabout Hitler -- which Prodigy yesterday condemned in strongterms.   &quot;Their response was crystal clear -- their guidelines wereonly meant to block personal insult, and specifically thisstuff was allowable,&quot; Mr. Sinensky said.   In response, Prodigy's Mr. Heilbrunn said, &quot;In all of ourcommunications with the ADL, we have focused on the broadissue of free expression. Before today, we have neveraddressed the contents of each individual note.&quot;   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Monday, Mr.Heilbrunn was asked specifically about the Hitler message andresponded: &quot;As repugnant as those particular postings may beto any individual, they were posted within the policy of freeexpression on the service.&quot;   Yesterday, Mr. Heilbrunn said he had been speaking &quot;in therush of deadlines,&quot; and added: &quot;My intention was to speakbroadly about all the notes&quot; at issue in the ADL'scomplaints.   The ADL had complained to Prodigy about five messages andsent reporters seven others. Prodigy said the four othermessages the ADL had sent it were fragments of notes thatwere posted and would meet its guidelines if taken incontext.   The ADL continued to object to the four others, whichexpressed hostile views towards Israel and, in one case,called the Holocaust &quot;a monument, so to speak, to the naivegullibility of the world in which even the most outrageoussurvivors' tales . . . are totally believed.&quot;   The ADL first complained about Prodigy in a July 31 letterto Prodigy President Theodore C. Papes, enclosing the fivemessages at issue. A Prodigy middle manager responded bydefending the &quot;free expression of ideas&quot; on the network.   In September the ADL sent the five messages to John F.Akers, chairman of International Business Machines Corp.,which, along with Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. owns Prodigy. Thatdrew a response from Mr. Papes, again asserting that Prodigyrejects messages &quot;that are beyond the bounds of reasonableexpression.&quot;   Asked why Prodigy hadn't earlier conducted a search to seeif the postings were legitimate, Mr. Heilbrunn said: &quot;Weexpected and had faith that the ADL had done checks on theaccuracy of it.&quot;   Prodigy said the ADL's complaint had engulfed it in anational uproar, after a report about the controversyappeared in the Journal. A spokesman said &quot;virtually every TVstation in the country&quot; covered the story Tuesday night, andWednesday morning Prodigy's fax machines were receivingheadlines from around the country. New York Newsday carriedit on its front page, with the giant tabloid headline: &quot;HighTech Hate.&quot;   As the dust settles on the Prodigy affair, the episodewill raise broader questions about the limits of free speechon the important emerging medium of computer networks.   Some civil libertarians argued that Prodigy, based inWhite Plains, N.Y., opens itself up to needless controversiesby trying to police every posting on its network foroffensiveness. &quot;Once they decide to make decisions about whatthey're going to allow, then they take responsibility forwhat they do allow,&quot; said Mike Godwin, counsel for theElectronic Frontier Foundation, a Cambridge, Mass., civilliberties group specializing in high-tech issues.   Mr. Godwin also suggested that Prodigy's mission to appealto &quot;family values&quot; while simultaneously supporting freeexpression may be impossible to reconcile.   &quot;It's easy to see why this has blown up -- those twomissions are inconsistent. You can't make sure thateverything is inoffensive and allow a forum for publicexpression -- it just doesn't work,&quot; he said.   But Prodigy officials said they are confident they canpull off that balancing act. &quot;We'll reflect the interests ofour on-line community -- just like any city does when itdecides what books and movies are acceptable,&quot; said Mr.Heilbrunn. &quot;It won't be easy, and it will evolve.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
