That would be ``a great victory,'' Awad said at a luncheonhosted by Margot Kidder, the actress and Jesse Jackson activist, atthe hotel where the Democratic Platform Committee was meeting.   Awad, an advocate of civil disobedience, urged the Democrats toaddress the Palestinian plight in the party platform. Israeldeported Awad on June 13 after 40 days in custody and accused himof fomenting unrest on the West Bank.   Awad, a Christian, said he was thinking of converting to Judiasmif that is the only way for him to get back into Israel and hisnative Jerusalem.   Jesse Jackson has sought to have the Democrats support aPalestinian homeland in their platform, but Michael Dukakis, thelikely nominee, has resisted.   The draft platform speaks of ``maintaining the specialrelationship with Israel'' while exerting ``new leadership todeliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations thathas been held out to Israel and its neighbors by the Camp DavidAccords.''   Platform committee member James Zogby, a Jackson adviser andexecutive director of the Arab American Institute, offered anamendment calling for ``peace based on mutual recognition,territorial compromise and self-determination for Israelis andPalestinians.''   However, the proposal was rejected on a voice vote after Sen.Bob Graham of Florida, speaking for the Dukakis side, said theparty should ``not succumb to the temptation ... of wishing toimpose on other parties what we think the solution should be'' inthe Middle East.   Awad, 44, who took out American citizenship while a student herebecause of visa problems, said he was not discouraged by Dukakis'refusal to accept the Jackson position.   Awad said it was ``kind of a political game'' and involves risksthat a President Dukakis could not be expected to take in his firstor second year in office.   ``I think if at least the platform would say `two-statesolution,' that will be a great victory,'' Awad said.   Zogby said nine state Democratic parties adopted platformsendorsing Palestinian self-determination or a homeland. He saidthey were: Washington, Vermont, Texas, Oregon, Minnesota, Maine,Illinois, Iowa and California.   Zogby noted before the vote that in 1984 a Jackson amendment onthe Middle East drew just 17 votes of support in the platformcommittee. Saturday's action was by voice vote, but there wereclearly far more than 17 in favor of the Jackson amendment.   The luncheon drew Reps. Bill Richardson, D-N.M. and Mary RoseOakar, D-Ohio, as well as Richard G. Hatcher, former mayor of Gary,Ind., and Tony Anaya, former governor of New Mexico.</TEXT></DOC>
