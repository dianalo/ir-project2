It promises toproduce a more bountiful, cheaper food supply. But for yearsthe promise has had to confront demagogic scaremongeringabout the science itself, which in turn frightens consumers,which in turn causes not-very-courageous supermarketexecutives to repudiate the new technology. Consider thestory of BST.   Since 1985, many dairy farmers have been hoping that theFood and Drug Administration would approve the use of agenetically engineered version of the growth hormone thatcows secrete naturally. This hormone is bovine somatotropin,or BST, and four U.S. companies have been trying to bring itto market. When given to cows, they produce up to 25% moremilk on the same amount of feed.</LP><TEXT>   The FDA determined as far back as 1985 that milk from cowstreated with BST is safe for human consumption. And theproductivity burst from wide use of BST holds out the hopefor lower prices for one of man's most basic foods. This sortof extraordinary innovation is of course one way to make lifeeasier for people living on tight budgets, but the oppositionwon't stand for it.   In April, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson signedlegislation to bar the use of BST there until June 1, 1991.Minnesota has enacted a similar ban. A moratorium, GovernorThompson explained, would provide &quot;sufficient time to allowfor additional farmer and consumer education on the use of&quot;BST. Unfortunately, it is also providing time for somemiseducation.   At the forefront of the anti-BST movement is free-mediaspecialist Jeremy Rifkin, filing petitions with the FDA andraising the possibility of time-consuming litigation. Ben andamp;Jerry's ice cream, serving a market that can afford to payextra to feel better about living well, has already announcedthat it won't attach its name to dairy products made of milkfrom BST-treated cows. Last month, Consumers Union, whichfeels obliged to launch a left-wing policy offensiveperiodically, objected to BST. Five major grocery chains haveannounced their unwillingness to handle BST milk so long asthe controversy lasts.   Opponents of BST make two arguments: that cheaper milkwill force smaller dairy farms to close, and that BST renderscows more susceptible to infection and thus endangers thesafety of the country's milk supply. Both claims are false.   Competition dooms not the smallest producers but the leastefficient producers. In the dairy business, the mostefficient producers are also often among the smallest. As anofficial from one of the companies that makes BST told acongressional subcommittee in 1986: &quot;The average size of thehighest yielding herds (top 20%) in the state of New York isapproximately 60. The average size of the lowest yieldingherds (bottom 20%) is also 60 -- exactly the same.&quot; Theeffect of BST is to cut all dairy farmers' fodder costs --the saving is proportionally the same for a big farm as for asmall one.   Worries over the safety of the milk supply are a moreserious issue. Happily, a panel of doctors and scientistsconvened by the National Institutes of Health unanimouslyconcluded on December 7 that milk from BST cows is safe forhuman consumption. The panel confirmed the observation madeby the deputy director of the FDA's Center for VeterinaryMedicine in December 1989 that &quot;BST is one of the safestproducts we've ever looked at.&quot;   So if BST is so great, why would anyone want to keep itoff the market? BST is the first big agriculturalbiotechnology breakthrough. If the fear-of-science movementcan kill so safe and beneficial a product, they -- and thebiotechnology companieswill know that they can stop otherproducts.   For biotech's opponents, this is DDay: If BST gets pastthem, the way is clear for innovation after innovation. Therecan be little doubt that this would be tough on the leastefficient farmers, who would prefer the status quo. For themore politicized opponents, the game is undoubtedly aboutpower. Once the large corporations bringing BST to markethave proved that genetic engineering is a safe technology,government regulators will spend less time with the subject.That in turn diminishes whatever leverage the&quot;public-interest&quot; groups have been able to accumulate overthis area of the country's economic life.   In 1950, before artificial insemination and new feedingmethods became common on American dairy farms, the averagecow yielded some 5,314 pounds of milk a year. Today, theaverage cow produces more than 14,300. That is theachievement of scientific farming. Better achievements arestill to come -- if the public and policy makers are willingto stand up to the scaremongers.</TEXT></DOC>
