Sonia Vassilva, 20, left London's Heathrow airport on aBulgarian Airlines flight to the capital Sofia.   Ms. Vassilva had said she feared for her safety if she wasreturned to Bulgaria but appeals to the Home Office wereunsuccessful and she was deported on the grounds she entered thecountry with an illegal passport.   ``We've written to all the embassies to try to get her to betaken in various countries,'' said Ms. Vassilva's Londonrepresentative, Max Clifford. ``But of course if you come into onecountry with an illegal passport it blots your copy book.''</TEXT></DOC>
