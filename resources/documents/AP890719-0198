The measure, sponsored by Sens. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., andAlfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was added to the Foreign RelationsAuthorization Act of 1990.   ``Today, we have restored the original intent of my provision tolast year's drug bill,'' Moynihan said afterward. ``Don't let it besaid that we didn't get tough. We drew the line. Now we can worktoward our original goal of demanding accountability.''   During final consideration of the 1989 supplementalappropriations bill in June, language was added to limit Moynihan'soriginal eviction provision in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. BothMoynihan and D'Amato voted for the supplemental, not realizing theywere voting to undo the eviction measure, D'Amato said at a newsconference Monday in New York.   The new provision restores the ability of federal officials towaive administrative hearings for drug criminals when the hearingswould duplicate eviction proceedings in state courts.   ``By passing this amendment, we are saying that we will no longersubsidize violence and criminal activity in public housing,''Moynihan said Wednesday.   In considering the same foreign relations authorization bill, theSenate unanimously passed a Moynihan amendment offering politicaland financial assistance to Burmese students.   The amendment provides $250,000 in refugee assistance for Burmeseprotesters living in Thailand, India and border camps; 15scholarships to Burmese students who have sought asylum outsidetheir country, which is engaged in civil war; and requests a reportfrom the attorney general and secretary of state on U.S. immigrationpolicy toward Burmese protesters.   The amendment also calls on the administration to continue itscondemnation of human rights violations by the current militaryregime in Burma.</TEXT></DOC>
