Icahn, Texaco Inc.'s major shareholder, sued to dissolve the company's agreement with Pennzoil Co. that bars Pennzoil from supporting his reorganization plan for Texaco.    Pennzoil backing for Mr. Icahn's plan would strengthen its chances of support from bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg, who has said he won't permit a plan to be filed without Pennzoil's approval.    Pennzoil claims that it is contractually bound by a seven-page &quot;secret&quot; agreement it signed with Texaco last month whereby both companies would support their jointly agreed reorganization, which includes a $3 billion settlement of their four-year legal battle. According to that agreement, neither company may &quot;vote for, consent to, support or participate in the formulation of any other plan in the reorganization case.&quot;    James W. Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive officer, in a letter to Mr. Icahn, called the lawsuit &quot;frivolous.&quot; He told Mr. Icahn in the letter that &quot;you risk sabotaging the very reorganization plan that you pushed for in your quest for short-term gains.&quot;    Mr. Kinnear also said that the &quot;uncertainty&quot; that the suit fosters hampers Texaco's restructuring efforts because it &quot;undermines any preliminary negotiations with prospective purchasers&quot; of assets that must be sold to finance the restructuring.    And in a statement, Texaco said the agreement between Texaco and Pennzoil is hardly a &quot;secret.&quot; It was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Dec. 24, along with the joint plan of reorganization, and it was referenced in the disclosure filed with the bankruptcy court Dec. 31.    But David Friedman, Mr. Icahn's bankruptcy counsel, disputed Texaco's position on the agreement with Pennzoil. He said: &quot;The document itself was never filed with the bankruptcy court and the referencing mentioned only flagged Texaco's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The agreement was buried in that document.&quot;    The Icahn lawsuit, filed in White Plains, N.Y., contends that Texaco illegally solicited Pennzoil's rejection of all alternative reorganization plans before a disclosure statement was approved by the court, an event that can't occur until later this month.    The reorganization aims to bring Texaco out of the Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy-law proceedings for which it filed last April 12. The Chapter 11 filing was made to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco awarded to Pennzoil by a Texas jury in December 1985.    That judgment arose from Pennzoil's claim that Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. had interfered illegally with a prior Pennzoil contract to acquire part of Getty. Under Chapter 11, a company seeks court protection from its creditors pending reorganization.    Last week, Mr. Icahn asked the court for permission to file his own reorganization plan that would compete with the Texaco-Pennzoil pact. Mr. Icahn's plan preserves the $3 billion settlement but calls for elimination of Texaco's takeover defenses. Such an action would make Texaco vulnerable to a hostile acquisition, thereby enhancing the price Mr. Icahn might expect to receive for his Texaco shares.    Separately, Mr. Icahn is expected to strike from his proposed plan the &quot;global releases&quot; that terminate holder lawsuits filed against Texaco directors and frees anyone involved with the acquisition of Getty Oil, the focus of the Texaco-Pennzoil battle, from any future claims by Texaco or its shareholders. Sources close to the bankruptcy-law proceedings say Mr. Icahn will eliminate the indemnification, currently included in his proposed plan, later this week through a court filing.    Houston-based Pennzoil declined to comment immediately on Mr. Icahn's suit, although a source close to the company questioned whether Pennzoil would readily abandon its arrangements with Texaco.    Pennzoil officials have said the future of Texaco's takeover protections are a matter for Texaco and Mr. Icahn and that Pennzoil hasn't any stake in the issue so long as it doesn't hurt Pennzoil's chances of collecting its $3 billion on schedule.    &quot;Pennzoil has a total commitment to support the plan,&quot; one Pennzoil official said recently.    Mr. Icahn has been battling Texaco's management over its takeover defenses for weeks. Indeed, Texaco has been examining ways to rid itself of Mr. Icahn and has considered looking for a buyer for his 12.3% stake, said a source close to the litigation.    But Mr. Icahn continues to be a buyer of Texaco shares. Market sources say he purchased an additional one million shares, or 0.4%, of Texaco yesterday and wants to increase his stake to 20% by acquiring as much as another 18 million shares over the next six weeks.    In addition, there was widespread speculation yesterday that major investors other than Mr. Icahn were accumulating Texaco shares as well. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco closed at $39 a share, up $1.25 on heavy volume. </TEXT></DOC>
