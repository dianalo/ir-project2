That covers all the bases, right?   Well, maybe not. It might just be that you aren't protectedagainst another common risk _ that you could suffer some disabilitythat prevents you from keeping your job.   Any agent who sells disability insurance can quote you dauntingfigures about the accidents and ills that befall people, endingtheir working careers or keeping them out of work for extendedperiods.   ``Statistics show that even at age 60 a person is more likely tobe disabled for more than 90 days than die prematurely,'' saysWilliam Brennan, who is not an insurance salesman but who edits thenewsletter Financial Planning Reporter for the accounting firm ofErnst andamp; Whinney.   ``What few people appreciate are the severe economic consequencesof a disability. Wages can be lost, substantial uninsured medicalexpenses incurred _even the children's education may be sacrificed.''   If you have not considered this question before now, advisers onmatters of personal finance say, the answer is not to panic and runout to buy the first disability policy you can find.   Rather, they suggest setting some time aside to assess where yourpresent disability protection stands and what, if anything, you needto do to improve it.   Many people assume that if they are disabled, they will getsomething from Social Security, state disability insurance programs,and their employer to tide them over.   In fact, they may indeed stand to get benefits from any or all ofthose sources. Perhaps you also have a large amount of savings putaside in the event of what used to be spoken of euphemistically as``a rainy day.''   If a careful calculation shows that these sources together wouldkeep your family solvent should some major disaster befell you, thenyou may not need to bother with any further insurance. That's nice,because private disability insurance isn't cheap.   But if the numbers don't add up quite so nicely, and you're thethe only wage-earner in a household with three children under theage of 6, an expert might advise you that ``disability income'' is aproduct for you.   In that event, you need to do some shopping, not just to comparepremium rates but to give careful study to the details of availablepolicies. A primary issue to consider: How the insurer defines``disability.''   Says Brennan, ``Steer clear of policies that only providebenefits if you're unable to perform duties of ANY occupation. Moreliberal policies define disability as the inability to perform theduties of your particular occupation.''   In addition, he says, you should determine that the policy can'tbe canceled or the premiums increased as long as you continue to paythem on time.   Other matters to investigate include whether the policy providesany inflation protection, since you may need to rely on it for manyyears, and whether it covers a partial disability that reduces butdoesn't eliminate your livelihood.   Most policies specify a waiting period _ say, 30 days _ betweenthe onset of the disability and the start of benefits. The cost ofthe premiums can be reduced substantially by increasing the waitingperiod.   ``As you might have guessed,'' Brennan concludes, ``the moreliberal the definition of disability, the higher the premium costs.   ``Don't let the costs scare you away, however. Disabilityinsurance fills a huge gap which could be left in an otherwisecarefully constructed financial plan.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs March 16</NOTE></DOC>
