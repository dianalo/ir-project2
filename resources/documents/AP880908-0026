By concentrating on efforts to limit emissions of hydrocarbons,rather than nitrogen oxides, the urban programs could be allowingnitric acids to form ozone in other areas, said James J. MacKenzie,one of the authors of a report released today by the WorldResources Institute.   An official of the Environmental Protection Agency, GeraldEmisson, said the agency's latest computer models showed no suchresult, at least for the Northeast.   Ozone, which damages the lungs, is believed by many researchersto be helping to kill high-altitude red spruce in the easternUnited States and several species in West Germany. It is formedfrom the reaction in sunlight of volatile hydrocarbons such asgasoline and the nitrogen oxides emitted in all combustion.   Quite small concentrations of nitrogen oxides, in contact withhydrocarbon compounds from trees, can form ozone, according toresearch completed within the past year.   The hydrocarbons from trees, mainly terpene or isoprene, ``inthe presence of almost trace amounts of nitrogen oxides, about 1part per billion, can produce fairly large amounts of ozone,''noted a report authored by MacKenzie and institute Vice PresidentMohammed T. El-Ashry.   In trying to bring 68 cities and other areas into compliancewith federal clean air standards for ozone, EPA seeks loweremissions of compounds such as gasoline. In polluted urban areas,reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone at first beforeeventually reducing it.   ``All that (nitrogen oxide emitted in urban areas) is going togo somewhere. It's going to increase ozone in rural areas,''MacKenzie said in an interview.   ``I think (EPA's policy) is a mistake. ... In urban areas youhave to reduce both'' hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, he said.   Emisson, head of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning andStandards at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that with computermodels, ``when we have looked at the Northeastern United States ona very crude scale, we don't see big ozone concentrations takingplace if you don't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentativeresults do not lead us to say there's a big problem in theforests.''   The institute surveyed the latest research on the effects ofozone and acid rain on crops and forests. Like many otherenvironmental groups and several proposals in Congress, it calledfor a 50 percent reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide fromindustrial and utility fossil fuel burning, a major precursor ofacid rain, and a 25 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogenoxides, which become nitric acid and increase rainfall acidity.   Today's typical rural concentrations of ozone are roughly twicenormal background. They probably reduce overall crop yields by 5percent to 10 percent, resulting in the loss of about $5 billion ayear, the report said.   Ozone on rural mountain peaks in the east can approach levelsEPA has defined as unhealthy, and the frequent clouds shrouding thepeaks can be 100 times more acidic than rainfall, the report noted.   The report itself did not examine EPA's urban-air strategies.   Heavy doses of ozone have long been known to kill treesdirectly. The report outlined theories by which the acids and ozonein combination could be killing trees by leaching out nutrients orleaving them too ill to resist drought or insects.   A 1987 scientific paper cited in the report said, ``In theabsence of (man-made nitrogen oxide) emissions, isoprenecontributes little to ozone formation.''   A simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides andhydrocarbons still might initially increase ozone in some urbanareas, said Jennifer Logan, an atmospheric chemist at HarvardUniversity. Emisson agreed, noting that no one knows yet whichcities might reduce nitrogen oxides without increasing ozonelocally.   ``An approach that helps ozone in urban areas might not do a lotof good in rural areas,'' Ms. Logan said. ``It's important torecognize that this is being actively investigated and people areonly beginning to grasp the science,'' but policymakers could findthemselves forced to favor trees or people, she said.   ``In a lot of the Northeast, it doesn't make a lot ofdifference'' to ozone formation whether urban nitrogen oxides arereduced, ``but if you get into the more forested areas it can makea difference,'' Ms. Logan said.</TEXT></DOC>
