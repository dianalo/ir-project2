Baseball fans honked horns and whooped it up in Oakland's JackLondon Square after the Athletics beat the cross-Bay rival SanFrancisco Giants 9-6 to win the championship in a four-game sweep.   ``There's nothing better than making a sweep of San Francisco,''said Andy Mousalimas, owner of Kings X bar, which was crowded withA's fans.   Oakland became the scene of tragedy at 5:04 p.m. Oct. 17 whenthe magnitude 7.1 earthquake collapsed double-decked Interstate880, crushing cars and causing 39 of the temblor's 64 knownfatalities.   San Francisco fans consoled themselves with other celebrations.Thousands flocked to the 10th annual Exotic-Erotic Halloween Ball.   ``Getting back to normal in San Francisco is like insanityanyplace else,'' said Louis Abolafia, producer and co-founder ofthe ball. ``People were ready for a release of all their pent upfeelings. Their houses are still shaking from all the continualtremors. If it all falls down, at least it will go down with aparty.''   The mood was more sober 70 miles south in Watsonville, ahard-hit agricultural city in Santa Cruz County near the epicenterof the quake.   Hundreds of people displaced from damaged homes or fearful ofgoing back inside buildings still live in tents and Red Crossshelters in Watsonville.   ``We don't want to be here for a long time,'' said JosefinaRoja, 37, who has lived in a tent with her husband since the quake.``But for now it's all right as long as it doesn't rain again.''   State and federal officials, meanwhile, were considering scalingback the hours of some centers where victims have been applying foraid. They were also considering consolidating centers because of adecline in applicants.   The Disaster Application Center in Daly City had only sevenapplicants Saturday and the Salinas center had only 14, said RhondaBrooks, spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   A total of 2,450 people applied on Saturday, 1,339 in person and1,111 by a telephone hotline. That brought the cumulativeregistration total to 26,541.   FEMA said that of the total, 12,678 applied for disaster housingassistance, 9,511 for individual or family grants to meetdisaster-related needs, 13,021 applied for Small BusinessAdministration home loans, and 5,750 applied for SBA business loans.   The U.S. Geological Survey, meanwhile, reported that the earthcontinued to move. A 3.1-magnitude aftershock hit at 2:28 p.m. PDTSaturday.   The USGS said there had been 80 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 orlarger by 4 p.m. PDT Saturday, including 20 of magnitude 4.0 orlarger.   A USGS statement said the probability of aftershocks decreasesrapidly during the first week after a quake, but then begins todecrease more slowly in later weeks and months.</TEXT></DOC>
