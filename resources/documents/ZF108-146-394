 This new system is designed to providesophisticated information services to an entire metropolitan area.andP;  We havecombined digital broadcast channels and duplex communication channels in apolychannel system that uses predicate based database content labels toautomatically route queries.andP;  Our thesis is that a polychannel systemproduces substantial cost and system scaling advantages while retaining theflexibility of client-server style duplex communication.andP;  Experimental datafrom a two year test of the Boston Community Information System (BCIS) withhundreads of users supports this thesis.andM;The overall goal of the BCIS project is to explore a new type of computerssystem architecture capable of providing sophisticated information servicesto every home and office in a city of perhaps a million people.andP;  As part ofthe project we have designed and implemented a system that addresses thisgoal, and tested it on a sample population in the Boston area.andM;We are interested in metropolitan area information systems because we believethat in the future computers will be the basis of a new mass communicationmedium far more powerful and important than the telephone.andP;  computers havethe intrinsic ability to autonomously react to incoming information, whichpermits computers to be an active medium for infortion as opposed to apassive medium, such as the telephone.andP;  For example, computers can inform usof important external events or taken direct action based upon such events,according to our preprogrammed instructions.andP;  Furthermore, computers can beused to interpret documents that include computationally active elements.andM;In order to explore the potential of computers as a communication medium westarted the BCIS project in September, 1982.andP;  The central idea of the projectwas to use both digital broadcast for mass data communication and duplexcommunication in a single unified framework.andP;  Our thesis was that this singleframework would integrate the cost and scale advantages of digital broadcastwith the flexibility of duplex communication.andM;Our project has resulted in a new approach to distributed computer systemswhich we believe will substantially broaden their application.andP;  Existingdistributed computer systems provide each computer with a duplex networkattachment used to communicate with other computers.andP;  We propose to add tothis basic architecture one or more low-cost digital broadcast facilitiesthat will provide mass digital communication to all of the computers in adistributed system.andP;  Our thesis is that the provision of a digital broadcastchannel will permit distributed systems to scale in size beyond the limits ofpresent technology and to offer new kinds of services.andM;We call systems that include both simplex and duplex channels polychannelsystems.andP;  Each remote site in a polychannel system has a local database usedto process most user requests.andP;  At each remote site this local database ismaintained by a computer that selectively applies updates received from adigital broadcast channel.andP;  A central site sends database updates of generalinterest over the digital broadcast channel to all sites.andP;  Whenever a site'sdatabase cannot process a portion of a request, duplex communication is usedto contact one or more remote server computers.andM;In general, when a large number of sites are interested in similar data asystem designer can use a polychannel system instead of a traditionaldistributed system to reduce communication and server capacity requirements.andO;Application areas include electronic mail systems, nationwide name servers,software distribution, and distributed database systems.andM;For example, in order to implement a polychannel airline reservation systemwe could provide each travel agency with a computer that would maintain adatabase of unsold seats.andP;  a travel agency's computer would keep its localcopy of the unsold seat database up-to-date by applying updates received viaa broadcast channel.andP;  Each travel agency's computer would only communicatewith the central airline computer when it actually wanted to book or change areservation.andM;An important benefit of a polychannel airline system is that a travel agencycan implement sophisticated applications that require high-bandwidth accessto the database of unsold seats.andP;  Yet there is no need for the airline toprovide additional server or communication capacity to accommodate anagency's applications.andP;  Furthermore the load presented to the airline systemis reduced from that of the standard duplex system approach.andM;In this article we also define a polychannel system and compare it withprevious work; decribe our prototype polychannel BCIS system; reportexperimental data from a test of the BCIS; and conclude with our view of howpolychannel systems may change the way we view shared information.andM;THE POLYCHANNEL ARCHITECTUREandM;Previous work that is related to polychannel systems can be divided into twomajor categories:andM;* Simplex systems use digital broadcast transmission to send to informationto terminals or computers.andP;  Because simplex systems are inherentlyunidirectional they are limited to information distribution applications.andO;However, they scale without limit since an incremental user site places noadditional load on the distribution system.andP;  This zero incremental cost alsoprovides simplex systems with a natural economic advantage.andM;Simplex information systems implemented before 1982 included Teletex systemsand stock-quote services.andP;  Teletex [12] sends a set of preformatted pages toterminals via broadcast transmissions.andP;  Stock-quote services such as Lotus'Signal transmit financial data over simplex channel to personal computerswhere the data is processed and presented.andP;  We implemented thefirst-text-based simplex system that used personal computers in 1984.andP;  In thelast few years additional database systems similar to ours have becomeoperational, including X*Press [13] and Mainstream Data [9].andP;  X*PressInformation Services transmits news information via cable television topersonal computers, Mainstream Data provides a general purpose degitalbroadcast service to major cities in the United States.andM;* Duplex systems offer interactive access to server computers via circuitswitched connections (such as the telephone network) or packet-switchednetworks.andP;  Duplex systems can provide a full range of services but servercapacity must grow linearly with the number of system users.andP;  Thus duplexsystems do not have the same economy of scale found in simplex systems.andM;All commercial information retrieval systems use duplex modem basedcommunication to connect terminals to a central time-sharing system.andP;  Forexample, France's Minitel, Dow-Jones' News Retrieval, and Mead Data Central'sNEXIS all work on this principle.andM;Our use of duplex systems builds on recent work in distributed databasesystems.andP;  In a distributed database system (such as System R(*1) [7]) duplescommunication is used to enable data distribution among a confederation ofcooperating computers.andM;A Polychannel system is designed to integrate the advantages of duplex andsimplex systems.andP;  A polychannel system is comprised of the following:andM;* Personal computers, one per user, for prescreening, processing, andpresenting information.andM;* Server computers that implement services such as historical databases,transactional services, and electronic mail.andP;  The servers can be operated bymany different organizations, and can be decentralized.andM;* One or more mass digital communication channels that broadcast informationto the personal computers.andP;  Information can be transmitted via cable TV,direct broadcast satellite, subcarriers on normal TV or FM stations, basebandRF broadcast, local area networks, or on-hook ISDN subscriber loops.andP;  Theinformation broadcast can include complete data records and programs forintegration into a personal computers' local database, indices and abstractsof services available on server computers, electronic mail notifications, andserver status information.andM;* A duplex communication system that permits computers to access each otheron demand.andP;  The duplex communication system can be circuit or packetswitched.andP;  It is possible for a single communication media (such as atelephone local loop) to provide access to both simplex and duplexcommunication services.andM;* System software that provides location transparency.andP;  A system is locationtransparent when it hides from a user where and how services are implemented.andO;When a system is location transparent it can freely distribute data andprocessing in order to minimize the cost of request processing and tomaximize the performance of the system.andP;  For example, we expect that in apolychannel system most user transactions will be performed by the user'spersonal computer.andP;  Users may be unaware that certain requests will bepartially or completely processed by servers.andP;  The degree of locationtransparency provided by a polychannel system is a matter of design choice.andM;The advantages that polychannel systems offer over duplex or simplex systemscan be summarized as follows:andM;* Polychannel systems scale beyond the limits of duplex systems.andP;  In a duplexsystem server capacity must grow linearly with the number of users becauseeach user request is processed by a central server.andP;  Our experimental datasuggest that over .99 of user information retrieval transactions can belocally processed in a polychannel system.andP;  Thus polychannel systems willrequire substantially less centralized server capacity than a duplex system.andM;* Polychannel systems offer significant cost advantages over duplex systems.andO;Digital broadcast has a zero incremental cret per additional user.andP;  Thusinformation sent via broadcast can be made available at a relatively lowprice.andM;* Polychannel systems permit users to add substantial value to broadcast datausing preexisting personal computers.andP;  This potentially further lowers thecost of a polychannel system.andM;* Polychannel systems provide a much richer set of service than do simplexsystems.andP;  In simplex systems there is no mechanism for users to communicatewith one another or with a central server.andP;  Thus many important applicationssuch as electronic mail and transaction processing that can not be providedin the framework of a simplex system.andM;* Polychannel systems provide a higher degree of privacy than do duplexsystems.andP;  Because a polychannel system implements information filtering in auser's personal computer, a user's interest profile is never transmitted to acentral server.andP;  Thus it is impossible for an intruder to gain access to thisinterest profile without physical access to the user's personal computer.andM;THE BOSTON COMMUNITYandM;INFORMATION SYSTEM (BCIS)andM;The requirements of a community information system suggest a polychannelbased architecture and well match the advantages of polychannel systems: atypical community based system will need to support over [10.sup.5] users;users will want an inexpensive system; the system will need to support abroad spectrum of information and transaction based applications; and userswill want to ensure that their detailed interests remain totally private.andM;We built the BCIS as an experimental test of our thesis that polychannelsystems can implement a personal dynamic medium for an entire metropolitanarea.andP;  The BCIS provides up-to-the-minute access to the New York Times andAssociated Press.andP;  In addition to the New York Times and Associated Pressinformation we ran limited tests that provided electronic mail, USENETbulletin boards, and programs via BCIS.andM;Figure 1 is a block diagram of the BCIS system.andM;* Server computers at our laboratory transmit database updates to remotesites and service user transactions.andP;  These servers continuously receiveinformation from the New York Times and the Associated Press.andP;  As thisinformation is received it is queued for transmission via our digitalbroadcast channel and is stored in a full-text database system.andP;  We receiveover 3 MBytes of data per day from our information suppliers.andP;  High serveravailabilty and reliability are achieved by our use of two server computersin an alternate-main configuration.andM;* We broadcast articles via a digital radio channel as soon as the articlesare received by our servers, and then periodically thereafter for two days.andO;The channel carries 20 MBytes of articles per day.andP;  The broadcast channel weuse is the 92 KHz FM SCA channel on WERS-FM, which can be received within 10to 20 miles from downtown Boston.andP;  Over this SCA channel we transmitasynchronous serial data (8 data bits, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit) at 4.8KBits/second with frequency shift keying (0 is transmitted as 89 KHz and a 1is transmitted as 95 KHz) [1].andP;  The packet radio receiver for this channel(see photo) has an RS-232 output, is about the size of a small paperbackbook, and costs less than $100 to manufacture (including all cabling).andM;* Each user has a personal computer that responds to requests and maintains alocal database drawn from the digital broadcasts.andP;  Requests are forwarded toa server computer when they can not be processed locally.andP;  The contents ofthe local database are defined by the user via a user specified filter thatdescribes what information should be locally retained.andP;  A filter thusprovides each user with the ability to define what the front page of his orher own personal newspaper will contain.andM;* Certain personal computers also include auto-dial modems that permit thepersonal computers to forward queries to a server for processing.andP;  A userwill notice a delay when a query is forwarded to a server, but otherwise theuse of server computers is completely transparent.andM;We will now describe the system's user interface, how content labels are usedto route queries, and our communication protocols.andP;  Further details on thearchitecture of the system can be found in [2.6].andM;The User Interface.andP;  The user interface to the BCIS System is shown inFigures 2, 3, and 4.andP;  The filter, summary, and article windows form theprimary interface to the system, and show successively more detail abouttopics.andP;  A user can switch between these windows with a single keystroke.andO;Pop-up menus and keyboard commands are used in a uniform way in all of thewindows.andP;  For example, a carriage-return processes the current queryregardless of what window is in view.andM;The filter window (Figure 2) contains a prioritized listing of a user'sinterests.andP;  The user edits the filter window to determine the informationthat his or her personal computer will retain from the digital broadcaststream.andP;  The filter window serves as the &quot;front page&quot; of a user'spersonalized newspaper and shows how many articles have been received byfilter line.andP;  Filter lines can easily be edited and reprioritized withkeyboard commands.andP;  A user can set triggers on certain filter lines so thatwhen a preselected article arrives the computer will either notify the useror it will print out the article.andM;The summary window (Figure 3) contains a short summary of each articlesatisfying the current query.andP;  This summary is composed of the first sentenceof each matching article.andM;The article window (Figure 4) displays the currently selected article.andP;  Thiswindow allows articles to be viewed, printed, and deleted.andM;The performance of the system is quite good.andP;  On an IBM-AT sub-secondresponse is provided for local query processing and article display.andM;Content Labels for Query Routing.andP;  Database content labels are used by thesystem to automatically route a query to the database or databases where thequery can be processed.andP;  A content label is succinct description of the datacontained in a database.andP;  For example, a content label could state that adatabase contained all New York Times movie reviews for 1986, or it couldstate that a database contained all articles by Quindlen in 1989.andP;  Contentlabels and database queries are expressed using predicates.andM;Content labels are used to route queries and updates.andP;  In order to routequeries to appropriate databases we use a simple theorem prover.andP;  If a querypredicate implies a database content label predicate then we know that thequery can be processed at the database.andP;  Database updates must be sent to alldatabases whose content label the updates satisfy.andM;Figure 5 illustrates the different relationships that can hold between aquery and a content label.andP;  Query Q1 describes a potential result set that isonly partially contained in DB1, but is contained entirely in DB2.andP;  Thus Q1is processed at DB2.andP;  Query Q2 describes a potential result set that is onlypartially contained in DB2.andP;  In this case the alternative query Q2' isgenerated and the user is asked for confirmation before Q2' is processed.andO;Query Q3 describes a potential result set that is not contained in DB1 orDB2.andP;  Thus Q3 is rejected.andM;The content label of a personal database is a user's filter list.andP;  Becausethe filter list precisely describes what is in a user's personal computer,the list is used to determine which queries can be processed locally, andwhich queries must be forwarded to a server.andM;The content labels of available server computers are kept in a configurationfile used by the personal computer's database system.andP;  The system will sendqueries that can not be processed locally to an appropriate server.andP;  When aquery can not be processed anywhere the system will so inform the user.andM;Servers in fact are comprised of many independent databases.andP;  Theseindependent databases are not visible from outside of the server, but once aquery enters a server a second level of query routing is used to dispatch thequery to appropriate internal database.andP;  This organization permits internaldatabases to be moved between servers and to be moved on and off line as aunit.andM;Communication Protocols.andP;  Our simplex communication protocol allows us toachieve any desired level of reliability while using an unreliable simplexlink [1].andP;  Data blocks (such as articles) are fragmented into packets fortransmission.andP;  Each packet includes a checksum for error detection, andpackets are repeated for error correction.andP;  Packet repeats are separated intime to minimize the effects of burst errors.andP;  We operate with a packet sizeof 128 bytes with a packet repeat count of 2, allowing us to transmit morethan 20 MBytes of data in 24 hours.andP;  In our primary service area aroundBoston the raw bit error rate of our simplex channel is less than[10.sup.-6], and after error correction it is less than [10.sup.-8].andM;All the data we broadcast is cryptographically protected against unauthorizeduse.andP;  Each user has a private key ring stored in his or her personal computerthat describes the data that the user is allowed to receive.andP;  Each data blockwe transmit is encrypted under a nonce key.andP;  After the nonce key has beenencrypted with a data source specific master key, this nonce key istransmitted along with the block.andP;  Our bulk encryption algorithm employs alinear feedback shift register with a non-linear output function.andP;  Furtherdetails on our broadcast protocols and cryptographic techniques can be foundin [1].andM;Our duplex communication protocol provides the advantages of remote procedurecall (RPC) while allowing us to make effective use of high-latency andlow-band-width channels [4].andP;  A problem with remote procedure call is that around-trip delay is incurred for each message that limits the performance ofRPC on moderate performance duplex channels.andP;  We have developed the channelmodel to overcome this limitation of RPC.andP;  The channel model incorporatesremote pipes along with remote procedures.andP;  A pipe is like a remoteprocedure, except that calls on a pipe do not return values and do not blocka caller.andP;  Pipe calls are optimized for maximum throughput, unlike remoteprocedure calls which are optimized for minimum delay.andP;  In order to controlthe concurrency introduced by pipes we introduce the idea of a channel group.andO;All the calls on a channel group made by a single caller are seriallyprocessed in the order in which they were made.andM;EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSandM;We designed the experimental test of the BCIS to answer the fundamentalquestion &quot;Is the information system technology that we have developeduseful?&quot;andP;  In order to address this question, we performed a longitudinalstudy on the use of the system by 200 people outside of our research group.andM;During late 1982 and early 1983, we worked out the design of an initialsystem.andP;  Once the design was completed in early 1983 we implemented aprototype.andP;  This prototype was operational at a site outside of our researchgroup in April 1984, and a small initial test population of 15 users wasestablished.andP;  Based upon the experience with this prototype, the system waslargely reimplemented during late 1984 and early 1985 to prepare it for alarger scale user test.andP;  The initial digital radio channel was replaced witha more reliable design, and the software was enhanced to provide new service.andM;In 1985, we formulated a plan for a two year test of the BCIS atapproximately 200 local area homes and businesses.andP;  The test started onDecember 17, 1985 with Version 6.0, a simplex only version of BCIS.andP;  OnOctober 7, 1986, users received Version 8.17 of the system, a polychannelversion of BCIS.andP;  In Version 8.17, queries which cannot be processed at auser's personal computer are automatically forwarded, via modem , to servercomputers at MIT for processing.andM;Experimental DesignandM;The experimental test of the system was performed on a self-selectedpopulation of computer literate volunteers.andP;  In order to simplify the testsubjects were required to own or have access to an IBM Personal Computer.andO;Participants were recruited via advertisements in the MIT paper Tech Talk, amailing to all MIT computer science professors, announcements at the IBM PCusers group of the Boston Computer Society, notices in Boston ComputerSociety publications, and by asking existing participants to recruit newparticipants.andP;  The professional profile of the participants is: 22 percentstudents, 21 percent professors, 15 percent hardware or software engineers, 9percent administrators, 6 percent research scientists, 4 percent physicians,and 3 percent librarians.andP;  The remaining 20 percent of the population iscomprised of professionals who are not computer scientists.andM;Participants were given the system for free.andP;  However, each participant wasobligated to complete and return a two-page questionnaire which we mailed outeach month.andP;  With the questionnaire, we sent a one page newsletter and apostage paid return envelope.andP;  At the onset of the experiment we toldparticipants that they would have to return the BCIS system which was loanedto them if they failed to complete and return their monthly questionnaires.andO;In order to reinforce this stipulation, each participant signed a legalagreement to this end when they joined the experiment, along with a statementthat they would not redistribute information received via the experiment.andO;Every month, telephone calls were made to participants who had not sent intheir systems and some began again to mail in the questionnaires.andP;  Ouroriginal user software included a user monitoring capability, but we decidednot to use this facility because of privacy and technical considerations.andM;Monthly questionnaires consisted of short answer questions and an essaytopic.andP;  The short answer questions were designed to focus on particularcontent, technology, or overall system issues.andP;  The essay topics weredesigned for evaluations and opinions on a wide variety of qualitativeissues.andP;  All questionnaire responses are confidential.andM;We designed the questionnaires to separate participants' reactions to theinformation provided via the system from their reactions to the technology wehave developed.andP;  Our experimental results show that people were largelypleased with the information provided via the system.andP;  Therefore, we believethe experimental results on the technology aspects of the sytem do notreflect unhappiness with the content the system provides.andM;In summary, our results are likely to be more favorable than would bereported by the general population of personal computer users because of theselection method for our experimental population.andP;  These people are mostlikely &quot;early adopters&quot; or users who would be likely to use the systeminitially.andP;  The predictive power of the data from these users is unclear.andO;However, within this constraint we have tried to perform a fair test of thetechnology we have developed.andM;Experimental ConclusionsandM;A summary of our experimental results follows.andP;  In the summary we haveincluded references to questionnaire dates in square brackets, e.g.andO;$(February 1986$), and averages of 0 to 10 scale ratings are shown with themaximum value of the scale, e.G.andP;  6.6/10.andP;  Our 1986 primary data areavailable in $(3$), and our 1987 primary data are available in $(5$).andM;The system provides a useful service.andP;  Our major conclusion is that apolychannel system provides a valuable service, based upon data from theexperimental test.andP;  Participants rated the overall system as being valuable(6.6/10 [February 1987]) and said they felt better informed with the system(7.4/10 [February 1987]).andP;  Figure 6 is a histogram of how 105 of ourparticipants (out of a total user population of 156) rated the value of thesystem [February 1987] on a 0 to 10 scale.andP;  On our 0 to 10 scale 0 waslabeled &quot;no value,&quot; 5 was labeled &quot;some value,&quot; and 10 was labeled &quot;greatvalue.&quot;andP;  Perhaps more importantly participants reported that they actuallyuse the system an average of 31-minutes a day, during which time they scan 46article summaries, 21 articles, and carefully read 8 articles [February1987].andP;  Figure 7 shows how much time participants reported that they actuallyuse the system [April 1986 to January 1987].andM;The number of users of the system peaked at 176 in October 1986.andP;  No newlarge scale distributions of systems were subsequently done, and the userpopulation stabilized at 130 within about one year.andP;  Some of the returnedsystems were never used, and some were returned due to system failings whichare described at the end of this section.andP;  Over 50 of the participants filledout questionnaires every month.andM;Participants reported that they would pay an average of $12.42 a month[January 1987] for the system, which further supports our conclusion that thesystem is valuable.andP;  In May 1988 we instituted a $5 per month fee and stoppedsending out surveyes.andP;  Of the 131 systems in use at that time, 89 users (68percent) decided to continue with the experiment and began paying.andP;  Thiscorresponds well to the 73 percent of the participants who said they would bewilling to pay for the system [January 1987].andM;Reported value and use of the system over time shows continued interest inthe system.andP;  Figure 8 is a plot of the 75th percentile, 50th percentile, and25th percentile of reported value of the system over a two year period.andO;Figure 9 is a similar plot that shows how many minutes per day users reportthey use the system.andP;  In Figure 9 it us unclear if the drop in the 25thpercentile line represents a drop in interest or an increase in userefficiency.andM;As one might expect users who report the system is valuable tend to use itmore.andP;  Figure 10 is a scatter plot of reported system value vs.andP;  the reportednumber of minutes per day of system use.andM;It appears that users who run the system more find it of greater value.andO;Figure 11 is a scatter plot of reported minutes per day of system operationvs.andP;  reported system value.andP;  It is also possible that users who find thesystem more useful tend to run it more.andM;Participants reported their use of the system was slightly biased towardspersonal as opposed to professional use (4.1/10 [October 1986]), and that thesystem caused them to use their personal computers more frequently (7.0/10[March 1986]).andP;  Users felt that the system has more applications in thebusiness world (6.8/10 [February 1987]) than in the home environment (4.8/10[February 1987]).andP;  Participants reported that 30 percent of the systems wereinstalled in an office [July 1987].andM;When looking for specific information participants preferred to use thesystem compared to a newspaper (6.7/10 [February 1987]) but when reading forgeneral information they slightly preferred a newspaper (4.8/10 [February1987]).andP;  Participants reported they read newspapers less frequently (4.29/10and watch television news less frequently (4.5/10 where 0 is less frequently,5 is the same frequency, and 10 is more frequently [February 1987]).andM;Comments by users include &quot;I think the system is great.andP;  I've gotten so usedto it the only time I read a newspaper is when I find it on the subway, andeven then, I know most of the stories&quot; [August 1986]; &quot;We are quickly gettinghooked on our daily information gathering via the air waves&quot; [August 1986];and &quot;...my interest in the system remains undiminished.andP;  If anything, I havebecome a more sophisticated user, more likely to add, change, or removefilter lines temporarily to capture articles of transient interest...&quot;andO;[August 1986].andP;  The most negative comment we received was &quot;I feel thesoftware could be better designed.andP;  Also having to dedicate my computer to itis a hassle&quot; [March 1986].andM;The simplex component of the system is essential.andP;  Participants rated thesimplex system as very useful (7.0/10 [April 1987]).andP;  The average participantruns the simplex system on his or her personal computer about 8 hours a dayto gather data with 25 percent of the users running it 10 or more hours perday [April 1987].andP;  In their written essays many participants describe thesimplex system using terms such as &quot;extremely valuable,&quot; &quot;quite useful,&quot; and&quot;absolutely vital for the BCIS to be successful&quot; [April 1987].andM;The duplex component is important.andP;  The duplex part of the system appears tobe an important component that strengthens the system even thoughparticipants do not use it frequently.andP;  Duplex users have the additionalability to search a full-text database of the past 90 days of the New YorkTimes.andP;  Users are aare when they use the duplex system because itautomatically dials their telephone and duplex database response is slowerthan local database response.andM;Participants rated the duplex system as somewhat useful (4.3/10 [April1987]).andP;  Thus the duplex system was reported to be less useful than thesimplex system.andP;  (38 system [November 1987]).andP;  A contributing factor to thisusage may be that 23 percent of the participants do not own modems [July1986].andP;  Some 49 percent of the users with modems did use the duplex system.andO;The average user reported using the duplex system .8 times a week, with aduplex session lasting an average of 9 minutes [November 1987].andM;Participants reported the duplex component may be critical to the commercialsuccess of the system (4.6/10 [May 1987]), and indicated that they would notbe happy if the duplex component was eliminated (2.6/10 [May 1987]).andP;  Inaddition, several participants noted the synergism between the simplex andduplex components of the system in their written essays.andP;  For example,participants wrote &quot;Broadcasting and remote access are integral parts of thewhole system.andP;  The interactive (remote access) portion strengthens thepassive (broadcasting) role of the system&quot; [May 1987]; &quot;I don't use thetwo-way part much, but I have found it very useful when I did use it.andP;  I feelboth aspects are important&quot; [May 1987], and &quot;I like the 2-way system and usethe system a lot more ...&quot; [January 1987].andM;Interestingly two participants wrote they found the duplex system much moreuseful than the simplex system, for example: &quot;Broadcasting for general newsis not useful to me.andP;  Remote access is useful.&quot;andM;Processing of information.andP;  Participants were enthusiastic about thefiltering facilities offered by the system and had an average of 30 lines intheir personal filters [March 1986].andP;  Participants wanted the ability to uselonger filter lines (7.2/10 [January 1988] and to turn filter lines on andoff (7.5/10 [January 1988] and to turn theme in essays was the need to keeprefining filters to get the most value from the system.andP;  One participantwrote &quot;First and foremost, I've built some skills at writing filters to catchthe articles I want,&quot; and another wrote &quot;I change, refine, and delete filterlines on a regular basis&quot; [August 1986].andM;System failings.andP;  The most common complaint about the system was the need todedicate a personal computer for its operation.andP;  Only a few users ran thesystem in the background.andP;  Participants reported they would pay $90 for a&quot;black box&quot; that would receive articles of interest while their personalcomputer was turned off [January 1987].andP;  Users also complained that it wasdifficult to produce appropriate filter lines and that duplicate articleswere not adequately filtered out.andM;In March 1987 we sent a follow-up questionnaire to 90 former participants andwe received 42 responses.andP;  The reasons most often cited for dropping out ofthe experiment were lack of time, poor radio reception, inadequate access toan IBM personal computer, and fear that continuous operation would damage apersonal computer.andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;We have proposed a polychannel architecture for future distributed systemswhich is intended to combine the scale and cost advantages of simplexcommunication with the flexibility of duplex communication.andP;  Our experimentaltest of the BCIS has confirmed our hypothesis that this architecture can beused to provide a new type of useful service.andP;  Users reported that they foundboth the simplex and duplex parts of the system valuable, with most userrequests being satisfied using data received via simplex transmission.andP;  Usersliked the personalized filtering of information which created an activemedium.andM;The major result of our work is that a polychannel system can be used toimplement a personalized active communication medium at a fraction of thecost of previous duplex based approaches.andP;  Our experimental data show thatpeople value both the duplex and simplex components of a polychannel system.andO;Our data also show the users like their ability to use local computation andstorage to add value to information.andM;Our work has extended previous research on new media forms [10] by performingexperiments with a new type of electronic media.andP;  Our experimental data showsthat polychannel systems overcome certain disadvantages present in previouselectronic media.andP;  Specifically, no previous electronic media combinesextensive user customization, high performance, low cost, and access to avery large database.andM;We expect that polychannel systems will become even more attractive in thefuture.andP;  Within 10 years the processor and memory of a complete IBM-PC classmachine will be on a single VLSI part.andP;  This part will allow an IBM-PC classcomputer to be integrated into a standard telephone-like appliance.andP;  Emergingstorage technologies will make it possible for us to use a polychannel systemfor creation of personal digital libraries.andP;  Digital broadcast to the homeand office will be easier to accomplish via future versions of the telephonelocal loop.andP;  In addition, there will be a greater need for computer aidedprocessing of information, since fiber optic technology will allow much moreinformation to be delivered to us.andM;We expect the local computational power of polychannel systems will be usedto interpret documents that contain computational element.andP;  Applicationprograms such as Hypercard make it very easy for non-programmers to createactive documents.andP;  In the future such active documents will be an importantcommunication medium because they allow us to represent knowledge withcomputational elements which are more reactive than is linear text on paper.andM;In sum, our experimental findings in the context of present technology trendssuggest that polychannel systems will offer an important future alternativeto traditional fully duplex distributed system designs.andP;  As our data show,these future systems will provide us with a new kind of personalized massmedia.andP;  This mass media will offer us the ability to learn more about ourworld and to communicate more effectively with one another.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;
