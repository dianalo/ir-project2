The Texas senator, in a speech to supporters at Texas A andamp; IUniversity, said he's ``been watching what's been going on at thatRepublican convention, what they're talking about in thatplatform.''   ``And from what I've heard of it thus far, it's just a repeat ofsome of the broken promises we heard in 1980 and back in 1984,'' hesaid.   The Republican platform committee held meetings in New Orleanslast week and the party's national convention begins there Mondaynight.   ``They've got a balanced budget amendment in that platform,'' hesaid. ``Remember that in 1980? They had it in '84.   ``And they haven't submitted a balanced budget yet to the UnitedStates Congress. Not yet, not one,'' he said. ``Michael Dukakis asgovernor of Massachusetts has introduced and passed ten balancedbudgets in a row.''   Bentsen said the GOP delegates are ``really not in touch withthe working men and women of America.''   ``They did a poll and found that over 80 percent of them didn'twant any funding of day care,'' he said. ``Now, the vast majorityof the American people understand the need for it.''   Bentsen press secretary Mike McCurry said the senator wasreferring to a poll of Republican delegates conducted by CNN andUSA Today.   Bentsen is on nine-day campaign trip aimed at preventing anerosion of Democratic support in his home state. Polls conductedafter the Democratic convention last month showed that Texas wouldgive its 29 electoral votes to the Democrats. Dukakis is scheduledto join Bentsen at the end of the trip, and the campaign has boughttelevision ads to coincide with the effort.   Vice President George Bush, the certain Republican nominee, alsoclaims Texas as his home and has been courting the state, too.   Bush is moving more campaign operations there and has hintedthat the Texas delegation at the GOP convention might be the firstto find out his choice for a running mate.   ``Is Texas important to this campaign _ you bet it is,'' Bentsensaid Saturday.   Bentsen, who has said he received 90 percent of the state'sHispanic vote in his last Senate campaign in 1982, told reportersFriday night he doubts that President Reagan's appointment of LauroF. Cavazos of Texas Tech University as the new secretary ofeducation would help Bush.   ``That was so apparent, I don't think it will have anyinfluence,'' he said. ``As far as getting any political mileage outof it, I don't think it will. A three-month appointment is notgoing to be that impressive to Hispanics.''   The senator had a full schedule of South Texas events Saturday,including stops in Laredo and Brownsville. He planned to spendSaturday night and most of Sunday relaxing at his father's ranch inMcAllen, before heading to Houston for more campaigning.   In Laredo, Bentsen spoke on local economic issues before theBorder Trade Alliance, a group that promotes better businessrelations between the U.S. and Mexico.   ``We've got to find ways to speed up the flow of people andgoods between Mexico and the U.S.,'' he said. ``But we need morethan a bill board on our side and a factory on the other side.'</TEXT></DOC>
