Elsewhere, Taipei's long winning streak came to an end.    Tokyo share prices rebounded during afternoon trading to recapture most of their early gains in moderate trading.    The Nikkei index rose 120.23 points to close at 27303.76. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 7.92 to 2155.08. Volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares, up from 650 million shares Monday.    Investors focused yet again largely on the heavy industrials and steels, although some construction and real estate shares managed gains.    Blue-chip electricals were mostly lower, however, while blue-chip auto makers were mixed. Pharmaceuticals were mostly weaker after posting gains Monday.    Ishikawajima-Harima Industries rose 75 yen to 1,050 yen ($7.95), while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was up 40 to 990 and Mitsui Engineering andamp; Shipbuilding rose 26 to 729. Nippon Steel gained 26 to 770, while Kobe Steel was up 26 to 590, and NKK was 24 higher at 699.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 221.52 points, to 27525.28.    Some traders said the buying of housing issues Monday spread throughout to the rest of the sector Tuesday.    One trader said that the housing issues &quot;were picked up because the long-term prime rate was raised, but housing loan rates weren't.&quot;    He said a decision to raise the longterm prime rate had been expected by the market for some time, and as a higher prime rate usually leads immediately to costlier mortgages and therefore slower housing starts, many investors had been selling housing shares.    Daiwa House was up 50 to 1,940, while Sekisui House rose 30 to 1,720.    In Frankfurt, the dollar's surge against the mark sent West German shares sharply higher as foreign investors poured into the market late in the session, brokers said.    After a slow first half of the session, prices rose sharply late as the dollar advanced despite interventions by the West German central bank.    Buying was led by international investors who focused their purchases on the best-known stocks, brokers said.    Reports that Daimler-Benz is cooperating more closely with MAN to shore up the two companies' truck operations sent both stocks upward. Daimler-Benz jumped 9 marks to 689 ($373), while MAN gained 9.1 to 197.5.    Also in the auto sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke was up 4.5 to 511.5, while Volkswagen gained 2.1 to 255.5.    In the banking sector, Deutsche Bank gained 5.5 to 472, while Dresdner Bank put on 3 to 252.5, and Commerzbank slumped 0.8 mark to 234.    London share prices finished fractionally lower in typical summer trading as players awaited Wednesday's U.K. balance of payments data for June.    Dealers noted a lack of substantive news on which to trade and little direction coming out of Wall Street.    The Financial Times 30-share index was off 1.1 points at 1473.0. Volume was an extremely light 338 million shares, although slightly better than the 288.4 million issues traded Monday. The 100-share index closed 0.8 point lower at 1837.7.    Market observers said players were paused ahead of the U.K. balance of payments data for June with the hope that the figures may enable equities to break out of their recent summer slump and chart a new, near-term course.    Wednesday's scheduled release of preliminary U.S. gross national product data for the second quarter also kept many London players cautious, dealers said, and might give London equities some trading stimulus, albeit probably short-lived.    However, several dealers said the indicators might be overlooked amid a torpid summer market. &quot;No matter what the figures are, I think we're resigned to drift sideways until the end of August,&quot; one pessimistic salesman said, adding that a lack of corporate news and few players in the market could combine for a very bland summer for equities.    Blue Circle Industries gained 8 pence to 446 ($7.76). Dealers said the rise came as several market makers found themselves short of stock amid a market perception that cement prices would probably rise as the construction boom continues in the U.K. Some said a large amount of Blue Circle options were purchased.    Property issues were firmer on the perception that several smaller concerns would likely become takeover targets by some of the larger companies to satisfy growing demand in the housing and construction sector in Britain. Land Securities advanced 7 to 557, MEPC gained 6 to 529, having been as high as 532, and Rose haugh rose 8 to 727.    Meanwhile, shares rose in Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Brussels, and were down in Zurich.    Paris stocks rose marginally as the market rebounded feebly from two consecutive daily declines. The gain partly reflected bargain-hunting in the wake of previous losses and the advance of Tokyo shares earlier. Demand was held back by a rise in June's unemployment rate.    Stocks were mixed in Hong Kong, Manila and Wellington and lower in Taipei, Sydney, Singapore and Seoul.    Taipei stocks ended lower despite an early advance, as traders took profits. Analysts said the market paused after a five-day rally that has driven major sectoral indicators to record highs.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                             July 25     July 22     Year    U.S. ...............      243.8       242.4      + 6.3    Britain ............      553.4       555.6      + 7.3    Canada .............      366.7       367.8      + 4.6    Japan ..............     1265.8      1262.6      +23.8    France .............      362.3       362.7      +25.5    Germany ............      178.8       179.6      +14.2    Hong Kong...........     1948.3      1961.3      +18.5    Switzerland ........      159.3       160.2      +13.2    Australia ..........      322.8       323.7      +24.5    World index ........      444.2       445.3      + 8.9</TEXT></DOC>
