Reilly   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/04/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3</SO><CO>   NWS TWX</CO><IN>MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)</IN><LP>   NEW YORK -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it has beenapproached by a number of parties interested in acquiring itsmagazine properties, and indicated for the first time that itmight consider such offers.   News Corp., responding to questions about reports ofpossible sales, said in a statement that to date it hasrebuffed the interested parties, which it declined toidentify. News Corp. said it continues to focus on selling&quot;noncore&quot; assets in Australia and the U.K. to reduce itsdebt.</LP><TEXT>   However, should it be unable to do so &quot;on satisfactoryterms,&quot; News Corp. &quot;would then consider alternatives,including the possible sale of certain magazines other thanTV Guide.&quot; The statement added, &quot;News Corp. is not selling.However, News Corp. is listening should it be interested inthe selling option at a future date.&quot;   News Corp.'s magazines include New York, Premiere, NewWoman, Seventeen, European Travel andamp; Life, Mirabella and SoapOpera Weekly. In 1988, the company spent $3 billion toacquire the publisher of TV Guide, Seventeen, and the DailyRacing Form, a move that made the company's already largedebt even more burdensome.   As previously reported, News Corp.'s banks recently agreedto restructure $7.6 billion of News Corp. debt, which eased acash crunch. Under the agreement, News Corp.'s lenders agreedto extend the maturities on loans, and provided short-termcredit to finance ongoing working capital and capitalexpenditure requirements. The agreement gave the companyleeway to repay its debt from asset sales, new equity andearnings.   It is unclear exactly what values are being placed on theU.S. titles, though some industry executives said the totalselling price for the 10 magazines could come in at $500 to$600 million. News Corp.'s statement did not mention thecompany's other U.S. print properties, such as the BostonHerald, San Antonio Express-News or the Daily Racing Form.   News Corp. is weighing magazine sales at a difficult time.The current climate for advertising has generally depressedmagazine values. News Corp.'s purchase of TV Guide andSeventeen magazines in 1988 was at the peak of themedia-acquisition market, and prices for properties havetumbled since then. When Hachette S.A. put Woman's Day up forsale last summer, most bids fell $50 million short of the$200 million Hachette initially expected. Magazine industryexecutives say News Corp. would not be able to sell TV Guidefor anything close to the price it paid.   In a meeting with editors and publishers on Friday, MartinSingerman, president of News America Publishing, and LeslieHinton, president of Murdoch Magazines, discussed thepossible sale of magazines. Mr. Murdoch didn't attend. &quot;Somepeople asked how we could continue to hire people once thenews of the sale got out,&quot; said one editor who attended themeeting. &quot;They said, `Just do it, there are plenty of goodpeople out there looking for work.'&quot;   Following the meeting on Friday there were more rumorsthat Time Warner Inc. had already agreed to acquire Premieremagazine. Time Warner executives said the movie magazine hadnever been offered to them. A spokesman for News Corp. saidno sales have taken place. &quot;News Corp. is simply trying todetermine what the marketplace is like,&quot; the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
