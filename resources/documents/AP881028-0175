He also proposed unspecified social programs ``to dampen possibleincrease of social tensions'' as a result of the reforms, which callfor closing unprofitable enterprises, Tanjug reported.   Raif Dizdarevic, head of the nation's collective presidency,warned the officials earlier Friday that Yugoslavia is facing its``final hour'' to put the economic changes into effect.   ``Political and ethnic tensions have increased to such a degreethat both the political and security situation have seriouslydeteriorated,'' he said.   They were addressing a rare emergency meeting between the Cabinetand the country's nine-member collective presidency called todiscuss a deepening economic crisis and resulting social strife.Only two such emergency meetings have been held since World War II,in 1981 and 1985.   Economic and ethnic problems have combined to prompt months ofdemonstrations with calls for an overhaul of the communistleadership and introduction of a multiparty system. The strife hasled to the ouster of party leaders in one of two autonomous nationalprovinces.   Mikulic said the government will introduce fundamentalmarket-oriented economic reform beginning next year to fight rampantinflation and growing labor unrest.   Deputy Premier Janez Zemljaric said at the meeting thatYugoslavia's annual inflation rate touched an all-time annual recordof 236 percent in October. Unemployment stands at about 15 percent.   The new economic system calls for closing down all unprofitableenterprises, widely introducing private domestic and foreign capitalinvestments, and floating stocks and bonds.   Yugoslavia's current economy mixes central planning and localworker control. About half of the country's companies are reportedto be losing money, and layoffs could fuel more social unrest.   In addition to hundreds of strikes, the country has faced Serbiannationalist demonstrations that have aggravated tension betweenSerbs and other groups in this fragile federation of six republicsand two provinces.   Press reports have speculated on the possibility of an armytakeover to quell the dissent.   However, Mikulic on Friday dismissed talk of ``an imminentmilitary coup or the danger of civil war.''</TEXT></DOC>
