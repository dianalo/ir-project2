With Saudi Arabia pumping about seven million barrels a day last week, production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries jumped to nearly 23 million barrels a day. For all October, OPEC's production averaged around 22 million barrels a day, according to figures compiled yesterday by leading monitors of the cartel's output.    The October figures represent the largest monthly gain -- 1.1 million barrels a day -- in OPEC production this year, and the highest average for a single month since 1982. For Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, October output was the highest since August 1986 when the kingdom was the ringleader of a battle for market share that caused an oil-price crash.    &quot;Saudi Arabia accounted for most of the October production rise with its output soaring 800,000 barrels a day to 5.9 million,&quot; OPEC Listener, a New York-based oil analysis service, reported.    Rumors of a new surge in OPEC output have been circulating in the industry this week. Prices have been drifting down again, but at a much slower rate than during some of the more volatile periods of the past. So far this week, the price of oil for December delivery at the New York Mercantile Exchange has fallen by 41 cents a barrel. It finished trading yesterday at $13.44 a barrel. &quot;We seem to be getting closer to $13, which many see as a psychological level,&quot; said Eric Bolling of New York-based Edge Trading Corp.    But trading activity in recent days has been lackluster and light. An increasing number of major oil companies and trading firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude prior to the November OPEC conference in Vienna, analysts said. &quot;It's just locals (floor traders) picking each other's pockets,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.    Prior to the surge, OPEC production had appeared to be leveling in the wake of the Madrid meeting of eight oil ministers charged with setting the cartel on a new course to prevent another oil-price crash. Then last week, Saudi production suddenly rose to between seven million and 7.2 million barrels a day, propelling total OPEC output to the new higher level for the month, Dow Jones International News Service reported yesterday.    Some OPEC-production trackers said one week's volume shouldn't be considered a trend. Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva, said the big jump in Saudi output last week was partly because of a &quot;bunching&quot; of tankers, which for one reason or another couldn't load earlier.    Nevertheless, Mr. Gerber and others expect Saudi output to remain high, with some estimates placing November production at as high as 6.3 million barrels a day. But plans to produce that much could change if the Saudis discern that progress is being made to resolve the production issue.    Saudi output has been creeping upward since it initiated a strategy last summer to chastise OPEC members who were pumping beyond their quotas. &quot;As long as OPEC refuses to accept production controls, Saudi Arabia will be a steady violator&quot; of its quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, said Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, New York.    The excess production, much of which is going into storage, is &quot;clearly a tactic to win concessions from OPEC quota violators&quot; prior to the full ministerial meeting later this month, said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;The Saudis have adopted the role of being the penalizer,&quot; he said.    Individuals familiar with the shuttle diplomacy currently taking place between OPEC oil ministers said little progress has been made in getting the United Arab Emirates to curb its production, which far exceeds its assigned quota. And although Iran and Iraq have expressed a desire to strike a production accord that would allow both to pump oil at an equal rate, there is some resistance to such an agreement within both governments.    The Iranians, in particular, &quot;must be afforded a face-saving gesture,&quot; said one individual who has been monitoring the negotiations. One possibility is counting production in the Saudi-Kuwait Neutral Zone, which currently goes to Iraq as &quot;war relief&quot; crude. &quot;If the Saudis, Kuwaitis and Iraqis include Neutral Zone production in their quotas, something which they haven't been doing, it might help Iranian negotiators gain influence in Tehran.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
