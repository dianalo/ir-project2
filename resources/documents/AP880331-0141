Democratic vote-counters said the Senate will easily approve theU.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons,despite Republican complaints over an amendment limiting futurepresidential interpretations of the agreement.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., No. 2 in the Democraticleadership, said his counts show no more than five of the 100senators are likely to vote against the pact. Ratification requiresapproval of 67 senators.   ``I think there will be hurdles, but I don't expect it to beturned down,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of theForeign Relations Committee.   Both Pell and Cranston offered their assessments shortly afterthe Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the pact Wednesday on a17-2 vote that included the support of 10 Democrats and sevenRepublicans. Only Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pressler,R-S.D., voted against the treaty.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidit was ``a very good action. ... We're hopeful for good, strongfloor debate and passage as soon as possible.   ``We certainly would like to have the treaty ratified before wego to Moscow for the summit and it looks like that's a goodpossibility,'' Fitzwater said. Reagan will arrive in Moscow on May29 and remain there until June 2.   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev, requires both sides to destroy allnuclear-armed missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.   Among the weapons that will destroyed are the Soviet force of650 SS-20s and other medium-range weapons aimed at western Europeantargets. The United States will give up Pershing II missilesstationed in West Germany and ground-launched cruise missilesstationed in five NATO nations.   The pact is the first in the history of arms control to requirethe actual destruction of the missiles that carry nuclear warheads.It is also the first to require on-site inspection to verifycompliance.   ``For the first time since Hiroshima, you see the number ofweapons going down,'' said Pell.   The treaty will probably come to the Senate floor by late Apriland when it does, Pell said, the most contentious issue will be theDemocratic-backed amendment.   The amendment says that a future president cannot change theU.S. intepretation of the treaty without congressional approval.   The fight stems from Reagan's assertion that he can unilaterallychange the interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty, a view challenged by congressional Democrats.   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., a supporter of the pact, calledthe amendment ``a great mistake'' and said, ``it very frankly maychange my position in response to the treaty'' on the floor.   Pressler predicted the amendment ``will lead to the defeat ofthis treaty entirely because (with it), the votes aren't there.''   The Foreign Relations vote was the third overwhelmingendorsement given the pact by a Senate committee. The IntelligenceCommittee unanimously approved it and the Armed Services Committeevoted in favor by an 18-2 margin.   The Armed Services Committee did express some concerns, andMaynard Glitman, chief U.S. negotiator, tried to answer those fearsWednesday in testimony before the Foreign Relations panel.   Glitman said ``futuristic'' weapons such as lasers and particlebeam generators are banned by the treaty if they are carried on``weapons delivery vehicles'' within the prohibited range.   The Soviets ``understand that all future (weapons) systemsfalling within the criteria will be banned,'' he told Helms.   And if an unarmed medium-range missile were to strike anddestroy a target through impact alone, it would be considered aweapon if it had been designed for that purpose, he said.   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Armed Services chairman, said hedidn't think Glitman's comments had settled the issue. Nunn said hewould seek a more definitive clarification during Senate debate.   Nunn said he might seek an amendment to the treaty requiring theadministration to obtain a specific statement from the Sovietsacknowledging that they had agreed not to produce, deploy or flighttest futuristic medium-range weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
