Thehot springs in the northern Kurikoma, the Onikobe caldera and Narukoarea from the center to the surrounding vary from high to medium temperatures,from acidic pH through neutral to alkaline pH, and from SO{sub 4} typeto Cl type and further to HCO{sub 3} type. The main composition of theerupting gas from the Jigoku area was acidic gas (H{sub 2}S, CO{sub 3},and SO{sub 2}). In the Onikobe caldera, a large amount of acidic thermalfluid contains higher amount of tritium than that in the neutral andalkaline fluids, suggesting that low pH thermal fluid stays undergroundfor shorter time. The thermal fluid discharged from KR-1 is neutral andcontains medium NaCl and the thermal fluids from KR-2 is also NaCl type.(4 figs, 4 tabs, 30 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
