Algeria laterreported progress in hostage talks in Beirut.   ``I tell the White House the problem of Lebanon has solutions,the freeing of the hostages has solutions _ reasonable, prudentsolutions,'' Rafsanjani said in his sermon in Tehran at weeklyMoslem prayers.   Official Algiers Radio said Saturday that progress was made intalks on Friday in which Algeria's ambassador in Beirut, KhaledHasnawi, was involved.   It said Hasnawi met with the spiritual leader of Hezbollah,Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, and with U.N. envoy MarrackGoulding in talks involving all hostages, whether ``Lebanese,Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis.''   ``Progress in this mediation was accomplished Friday,'' theofficial state radio said, without elaborating.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said shewas aware of the report from Algeria but added, ``I have nothingspecific on that.''   Algeria, while proud of its role in mediating past crises,including the January 1981 release of American hostages held in theU.S. Embassy in Tehran, usually is close-mouthed about itsinvolvement until an issue is settled. The radio report was seen asa sign that Algerian authorities think a deal is close.   Goulding met with Hasnawi for 30 minutes in Beirut, and said hesought Algeria's help in determining the fate of Lt. Col. WilliamR. Higgins.   Higgins, a U.S. Marine, was kidnapped on U.N. duty in February1988. His captors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation forIsrael's abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric.   A videotape was released, showing a man on a gallows whoappeared to be Higgins, but no body has been found. Some reportssaid he was killed months ago.   In the streets of Beirut, pro-Iranian Shiite zealots ofHezbollah, the group believed to hold the Western hostages, paradedto denounce the United States. At weekly prayers before thedemonstration, Fadlallah urged those holding the hostages not toharm them.   President Bush said he would explore Rafsanjani's offer ``to thefullest,'' but added: ``I don't want to raise hopes beyondfulfillment.''   The International Committee of the Red Cross expressedwillingness to relay to Israel the demands for a prisoner releasemade Thursday by the kidnappers of American hostage Joseph Cicippiowhen they suspended plans to kill him.   A knowledgeable Shiite source in Beirut, speaking privately,said the final word on Cicippio's reprieve came from Rafsanjani,who ``must have used his first day in office to pressure thekidnappers to spare Cicippio's life.''   Rafsanjani, who was inaugurated Thursday, is believed eager toimprove ties with the West and erase Iran's image as a sponsor ofinternational terrorism. In his sermon, he sought a conciliatorytone with the United States.   ``These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will notsolve the problems. Come, let us approach the problem reasonably;we too will help solv the problems there, so the people of theregion can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the sermon,broadcast by Tehran radio.   Rafsanjani said that if the United States wants hostages freed,it must ask Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the statements``encouraging'' but said the hostage situation was ``a seriousproblem'' and he did not expect changes in the increased deploymentof U.S. Navy forces in the Mediterranean.   Israel sent commandos to southern Lebanon on July 28 to abductObeid, a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God. Israeloffered to trade Obeid and other Shiite prisoners for three Israelisoldiers held in Lebanon and for the Western hostages.   Rafsanjani said about the Higgins killing: ``We do not make anyjudgment about the group that executed the American colonel. Youcannot condemn the innocent people of Lebanon ... on the vaguebasis that some group has possibly killed someone (Higgins) for acrime.''   If America responds by saying it cannot pressure Israel intofreeing Obeid, ``this isn't acceptable to us,'' Rafsanjani said.   Sixteen Westerners are captives in Lebanon, including eightAmericans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was seized March 16,1985.   In south Beirut, Fadlallah said those holding the hostagesshould not harm them.   ``Let's be better than they'' he said of what Hezbollah and Irancall ``the arrogant powers.''   ``Let's be loftier. Let's be more humanitarian. What we want isfor those detained people not to be hurt.''   The demonstration after his sermon was to protest Obeid'sabduction. Men with beards and women in ankle-length black chadorscarried banners reading ``Death to America, the mother of allterrorism.''   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, one of the kidnappinggroups believed to be fronts for Hezbollah, said Thursday it wassuspending its death sentence against Cicippio and replacing itwith demands that Israel free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners.It said it would provide a list to the Red Cross.   Michel Dufour, chief Red Cross delegate in Lebanon, said:``We've taken notice that our services may be needed, and if aparty approaches us to transmit messages, we'll do it.''   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham, said in Beirut that her heart,``which was full of despair, sadness and pain for several years,has regained some hope and was refreshed by this encouraginghumanitarian initiative.''   In his hometown of Norristown, Pa., the hostage's relativesdecorated a sign proclaiming the number of his days in captivitywith a dozen balloons and an American flag. Cicippio was kidnappedSept. 12, 1986.   In Jerusalem, Israel's top leaders conferred about a response tothe demands, which Revolutionary Justice said must be accepted``within days.'' It did not say what would happen to Cicippio ifIsrael refused.   In addition to Algeria's aid, Turkey announced Friday it hadbeen in touch with all sides.</TEXT></DOC>
