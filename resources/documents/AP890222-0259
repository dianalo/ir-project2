LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mexico plans to cut oil exports about 5percent and raise some crude prices by 10 cents a barrel startingMarch 1 in an effort to help strengthen world oil prices, governmentsources said Wednesday.   The disclosures followed Tuesday's meeting in London of non-OPECproducing countries, including Mexico, who have pledged to supportOPEC's effort to reduce production and raise prices.   A source at the state oil monopoly, Pemex, who insisted onanonymity, said the government would announce the cuts within thenext few days.   Emilio Matar, a spokesman for Pemex, confirmed that the newprices would take effect March 1.   The increases would be for the posted price of Mexican lightIsthmus sold to the United States and Western Europe and extra-lightOlmec sold to the United States.   Energy and Mines Secretary Fernando Hiriart told reporters onMonday that Mexico was willing to reduce its exports by 5 to 6percent for the rest of this year, provided other oil exportingcountries reduce their sales.   The Pemex source said that if other countries honor the Londonagreement Mexico would reduce its average daily exports by as muchas 65,000 barrels a day. The amount would probably vary from monthto month, but could average about 5 percent lower than Januaryexports, the source said.   The source did not say which countries' exports would be targetedfor cutbacks.   Details of the London agreement have not been released. Astatement issued after Tuesday's meeting said that some countrieswould reduce exports while others would freeze sales temporarily andthat details were forthcoming.   Production by Mexico, the world's sixth largest crude oilproducer, averages 2.5 million barrels a day. In January, itexported a total of 1.3 million barrels a day _ approximately halfto the United States. Japan, its principal customer in the Far East,buys an average of 180,000 barrels daily.   Mexico also imports 58,000 barrels daily from the United Statesfor some of its northern border region to save transportation costs.   Last November, the 13-member Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries agreed to lower its exports to 18.5 million barrels a dayin the first half of 1989 to buoy world market prices and called onindependent producers to make similar cuts. Mexico is not a memberof OPEC, but often uses that international cartel's pricingguidelines.   OPEC, whose production late last year was estimated at 22.5million barrels a day, agreed to the new quota after oil pricessagged to about $10 a barrel, well below the cartel's benchmark of$18.   Mexico sets different prices for its crude for the United States,Europe and the Far East, under long-term contracts with individualcustomers.   The price of heavy Maya to the United States averaged $12.38 abarrel during the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged$15.86 and Olmec $16.80 barrel. In Western Europe, Maya averaged$11.52 and Isthmus $15.71 a barrel. In the Far East, Maya averaged$12.20 and Isthmus $14.85 a barrel, according to the latest Pemexfigures.   Pemex sells Olmec, which it started producing in mid-1988 insmall quantities, only to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
