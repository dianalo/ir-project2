The vice president said Dukakis' lack of experience in foreignpolicy is fertile ground for debate and Bush said he will spell outtheir differences on conventional weapons and strategic defense.   The all-but-certain GOP nominee said Dukakis' increased emphasison conventional forces and calls for cuts in nuclear systemsindicates a ``troubling conclusion about winnability for aconventional force war in Europe.''   The issue ``is a very serious debate that has not been joined... will be joined by me,'' Bush told reporters en route toColumbus, Ohio, for a campaign appearance. ``Obviously he (Dukakis)will have to join it. I think I will come out well on that.''   Bush, in a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police, accusedCongress of inaction in the war on drugs and cited the $72 millioncut in the Reagan administration's Coast Guard budget request.   ``Congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issues of drugs,but when it comes to law enforcement some of them go AWOL,'' Bushsaid at the organization's national board meeting in Ohio.   Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, addressing thegroup as a surrogate for Dukakis, disputed Bush's claims, notingthat the administration's 1988 budget sought a $900 million cut inanti-drug funding, including money for Coast Guard and BorderPatrol interdiction efforts. It also included a 60 percent cut indrug prevention and education programs.   DeConcini said Congress restored 70 percent of the funds andsaid Bush's claim is ``just a bogus argument.''   Dukakis has criticized the Reagan administration for permittingCoast Guard budget cuts, saying, ``How can we possibly be seriousabout fighting a war on drugs when we're cutting Coast Guardpatrols by 55 percent? It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasonsI'm running for the presidency.''   The Massachusetts governor is vacationing in Nantucket thisweekend, staying at the home of friends. The likely Democraticnominee received promising news from his party platform delegatesin Denver where a blueprint plan was worked out.   Dukakis' backers easily turned aside Jackson efforts to addplanks that would have committed the Democrats to raise taxes onthe wealthy, freeze the Pentagon budget, double education spending,commit the United States to no first use of nuclear weapons and toa call for Palestinian self-determination.   The committees handled without rancor a number of amendments,rejecting some key Jackson stands but accepting others, includingones calling for Third World debt relief and significant increasesin child care aid for low-and middle-income families.   ``Although we have differences ... about 95 percent of all theissues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolvedin a peaceful and in a unified way, and I know that scares theRepublicans to death,'' said former Gary, Ind., Mayor RichardHatcher who introduced a Jackson budget amendment that failed.   Mike Barnes, the former Maryland congressman who led Dukakis'platform team, said that in working on the past four partyplatforms, ``I have never seen a situation that was anywhere nearthis unified.''   In Nantucket, Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan said theMassachusetts governor spoke with his senior aide Jack Corriganbefore departing for his four-day vacation on Friday and did notreceive a briefing after the vote by the Democratic Party'splatform committee.   While the action was taken amid signals of party unity, anddisplayed Dukakis' strength in controlling the platform issue,Gearan made no claim that the Democratic National Convention inAtlanta next month would be free of floor battles over the platform.   ``We have a good working relationship with Jackson's campaign,and things are going well,'' Gearan said.   But he added, ``I think he's said all along there could verywell be some floor fights at the convention.''   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said nodecisions had been made on which if any of the issues Jackson wouldfight for on the floor of next month's convention in Atlanta.However, she said that the two Democrats ``in these proceedingsmoved closer together.''   Jackson, campaigning in St. Croix, said he doesn't want aconvention of floor fights, but indicated that he wasn't satisfiedwith the weekend work of the platform committee.   ``There will no doubt be some minority positions taken to thefloor,'' he told reporters. ``I do not think bland is beautiful.People ought to be specific, ought to make promises, ought to keeppromises, ought to be make commitments. People have given amandate.''   The moderate platform, which will not be final until approved bythe convention in Atlanta on July 19, is expected to run about4,000 words _ the shortest since the terse platforms that FranklinD. Roosevelt ran on in 1932 and 1936.   In Iowa, meanwhile, Dukakis picked up 10 delegates at the stateconvention, and party spokesman Phil Roeder said nine uncommitteddelegates will back the Massachusetts governor, giving him a 49-12advantage over Jackson. At the GOP state convention, Bush gainedall 37 delegates.   The two presidential contenders both finished third in Iowa'sinitial contest five months ago.</TEXT></DOC>
