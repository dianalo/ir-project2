(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The second-degree murder conviction of awoman who claimed the ``baby blues'' caused her to run over herinfant son with a car was set aside Friday by a judge who found thewoman innocent by reason of insanity.   Sheryl Massip, 24, who testified that post-partum depressiondrove her to kill the colicky, constantly crying boy, was not guiltyof murder, said Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald.   ``I do not believe the prosecution's evidence established thatshe had the requisite mental state of malice aforethought,'' thejudge said. He said while he knew his ruling was unusual, he felt hehad no choice.   Unless overturned on appeal by the prosecution, the judge'sruling invalidates a Nov. 17 jury verdict of second-degree murder,which called for a sentence of 15 years to life.   Fitzgerald delivered what he referred to as an ``unprecedented''decision: first reducing the charge against her from second-degreemurder to voluntary manslaughter, then ruling that she was notguilty by reason of insanity. The decision, however, still leavesthe defendant eligible for commitment to a mental hospital for up to11 years.   ``This is new ground that we plowed today,'' the judge said in aninterview with the Los Angeles Times after issuing his ruling. ``Idon't know of another court that came to a decision like the one Ided to set aside the jury verdict altogether.   ``I know people will say I've overstepped my bounds. But the moreI thought about it, the more I realized I didn't have any choice butto find her insane. ... She was bonkers.''   Mrs. Massip welcomed the verdict.   ``I was praying the people would understand,'' she said outsidecourt. ``The jury did not understand, but I'm thankful that thejudge did.''   Mrs. Massip testified at the trial that on April 29, 1987, herown 23rd birthday, she hit her 6-week-old son, Michael, on the headwith a garden tool, then put him under the wheels of the familystation wagon, ran over him and put his body in a trash can.   Defense witnesses said an exceptionally bad case of post-partumdepression, a hormonal ailment known as the ``baby blues,'' was toblame. Defense attorney Milton Grimes said the young mother waswracked by lack of sleep and hallucinations and that she heardvoices telling her to put the boy out of his misery.</TEXT></DOC>
