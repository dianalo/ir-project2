(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Plans to install floating toilets for theconvenience of boaters on reservoirs east and west of here aren'texactly getting flushed down the tubes by concerned officials.   ``It may seem that this is something kind of frivolous, but whenyou think about it, when you gotta go, you gotta go,'' MaricopaCounty parks Director Bill Richwine said Thursday.   For a boater on the northeast corner of Lake Pleasant, ``youronly alternative is to go ashore and get behind a cactus or go overinto the water and do it,'' Richwine said.   Richwine envisions two floating toilets anchored in the upper,more remote regions of the lake about 25 miles northwest of Phoenix.   Each would be a one-holer restroom floating on pontoons. Theywould have holding tanks similar to those in the portable toiletsused at construction sites, golf tourneys and concerts.   Richwine said he would make the county Board of Supervisorsprivy to his plans in two weeks in order to apply for a $90,000State Lake Improvement Fund grant to pay for the restrooms and atrailer to haul them.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service is considering putting sixfloating potties on Roosevelt Lake about 60 miles northeast ofPhoenix, said David Killebrew of Tonto National Forest.   The toilets are part of an $18 million improvement plan for thepopular water-sports site, Killebrew said. Construction is to beginin 1990.</TEXT><DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn.

The researcher who changed the missing alligator's sex examinedthe garden gator and pronounced it a different, ordinary reptile,Memphis State biology department Chairman Jim Payne said recently.   The missing alligator was stolen last November from a biologylaboratory at Memphis State.   The 2-foot-long gator was one of a dozen or so used to study theeffects of hormones and environment on reptile sex determination.While still in the egg, it was changed from a boy to a girl.   An alligator fitting the missing animal's description turned upin a garden June 14, but the only person who could confirm thereptile's identity, biologist William Gutzke, was in the GalapagosIslands inspecting the sex organs of turtles.   Gutzke passed through town a few days ago, examined thealligator and decided it was not his, Payne said.
