(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State Sen. Gene Taylor won an overwhelmingvictory over Republican Tom Anderson in a special congressionalelection Tuesday, giving the Democrats all five of Mississippi'sU.S. House seats for the first time in 17 years.   With all 372 precincts reporting in the race to pick a successorto the late U.S. Rep. Larkin Smith, Taylor had 83,093 votes, or 65percent, to 44,430, or 35 percent for Anderson, a veteranWashington aide.   The GOP, which holds both of Mississippi's U.S. Senate seats,lost its only House seat, which it had held since 1972. Smith, aRepublican, died in a small plane crash in August.   Taylor carried all but one of the 12 counties in the 5thDistrict in Mississippi's southeastern corner, which includes theGulf Coast and the cities of Biloxi, Gulfport and Hattiesburg.   ``I'm kind of bewildered by the numbers,'' Taylor, 36, said in atelephone interview from Biloxi on Tuesday night. ``We hoped towin, but we're overwhelmed.''   Taylor, a conservative, said residents of the district ``canexpect someone who is going to go to bat. Above all, I hope theycome to expect honest government.'' He said he would ask to besworn in next Tuesday.   Anderson conceded defeat around 8:30 p.m., saying he hadn't hadenough time to build a successful campaign.   ``We came from nowhere, we worked hard,'' he said. ``It's beenthe longest 50 days of my life.''   Taylor represented Bay St. Louis in the state Senate. Anderson,43, was a longtime chief of staff to U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, who heldthe seat for the Republicans for 16 years before going on to theSenate. Smith defeated Taylor for the post last year.   The GOP showed the importance they place on the seat in theamount of money Anderson spent, a campaign appearance by PresidentBush and Lott's visibility. Anderson spent about $500,000, roughlyfive times Taylor's spending.   ``That district is important to us not because it has been inRepublican hands for so long,'' said state Democratic Chairman EdCole. ``That's one of the reasons.   ``But that district represents the best of what Mississippi hasto offer in that it has the strongest economy, the highest percapita income, the highest technology base and the greatestpopulation growth in the last 10 years.''   In the primary Oct. 3, Taylor got 42 percent of the vote andAnderson 37 percent. Attorney General Mike Moore, a Democrat, got21 percent of the vote and was eliminated.   Authorities found Smith and his pilot Aug. 14 in wreckage oftheir single-engine plane. Smith, a popular law enforcementofficial on the coast, was returning from opening ceremonies at theDixie World Series in Hattiesburg.   Tuesday's election was the seventh special congressionalelection this year. Of the previous six, Democrats won four,Republicans two.   There is an eighth such election scheduled for Nov. 7, in Texasto fill the seat of the late Mickey Leland, who also died in aplane crash.</TEXT></DOC>
