The discount rate cut by the West German Bundesbank had been a focus of speculation all week. But the lowering of rates by five other European central banks was less expected. Traders said the activity showed a greater degree of international economic cooperation than the foreign exchange markets had believed likely.    Even the Bundesbank's action, lowering its charge on loans to financial institutions to 2 1/2% from 3%, surprised some currency traders, as doubts about that move had arisen Wednesday.    The interest rate cuts widened the gap between most European rates and the higher U.S. interest rates. That serves to increase the appeal of dollar-denominated investments.    The dollar responded yesterday by rising 1% to 1.6625 West German marks in late New York trading from 1.6458 late Wednesday.    Although the interest rate moves were partly intended to bolster the U.S. currency, traders said their positive effects on the dollar will be temporary, probably lasting no more than a few weeks. The large U.S. trade and budget deficits remain forceful negative factors for the dollar, traders said.    &quot;You can't let short-term moves like this change your long-term perspective,&quot; Richard Witten, vice president, foreign exchange, at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, said. He said the dollar will probably drop about a further 7%, to around 1.55 marks, within six months.    The dollar also may face longer-term downward pressure because of concern about U.S. political leadership and next year's presidential election, some market participants said.    &quot;I think the political scenario is the worst for the dollar,&quot; Michael A. Gotthelf, president of Metallbank Capital Corp., an investment house based in West Germany, said in New York.    Keeping yesterday's rally in perspective, traders also said that although the dollar climbed on the interest rate news, its move was only about as big as its rise and fall in the preceding two days as expectations of the rate cuts waxed and waned.    The Bundesbank's rate cut, the centerpiece of yesterday's coordinated reductions, was preceded by a rate move in London. The Bank of England lowered its money market dealing rates, causing British commercial banks to trim their base lending rates to 8 1/2% from 9%. That move came about the time the New York business day was getting under way.    The Bundesbank acted next, followed by the French, Dutch, Austrian and Swiss central banks. The Bank of France cut two of its money market rates by one-quarter point each; the Nederlandsche Bank cut the Dutch discount rate a quarter-point to 3.75%; the Austrian discount rate was trimmed a half-point to 3%; and the Swiss rate was cut to 2 1/2% from 3%.    The widely anticipated West German rate cut already had been partly factored into exchange rates. However, the doubts that arose about the move Wednesday and continued early yesterday had caused the dollar to trade lower.    Yesterday morning, &quot;everyone was fearful the Bundesbank was reconsidering,&quot; James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York, said. Those doubts meant there was room for the dollar to bounce back up when the cut finally came, he said.    The cuts by other European nations then added to the lift the U.S. currency got.    &quot;The dollar seemed to get its boost not so much from the discount rate cuts per se, but from the announcement that these were coordinated moves,&quot; Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs said.    In other late New York dealings, the British pound was down 1% to $1.8030 from $1.8203 a day earlier, and the dollar climbed 1% to 5.6545 French francs from 5.6005.    In contrast to its performance against the major European currencies, the dollar rose only slightly against the Japanese yen, as the Bank of Japan did not lower its interest rates along with the other central banks. The dollar firmed 0.2% to 132.75 yen from 132.51 late Wednesday.    Yesterday's interest rate moves, however, aren't expected to do anything more than briefly interrupt the dollar's 33-month-old decline. Mr. Gotthelf of Metallbank said the rate cuts and customary year-end commercial demand for dollars could stabilize the currency over the next few weeks. &quot;But in the next couple of months, we'll see another big push down on the dollar,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery rose 70 cents an ounce to $488.80 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 4.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $486.35 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, Dec. 3, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.

The intervention -- disclosed in a quarterly report by thebank, which is the official U.S. agent in the foreignexchange market -- was described as in accordance with theLouvre agreement to stabilize currency rates.   That agreement was signed in Paris in February by theU.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.It is understood to have established target zones forexchange rates, but those have never been disclosed.   The Fed's intervention was carried out in conjunction withsimilar action by the West German, Japanese and other centralbanks, the Fed said.   The report said the Fed sold $631 million to buy WestGerman marks between Aug. 4 and Aug. 10 &quot;to resist the upwardpressure&quot; on the dollar as it climbed toward what was then aseven-month high of 1.9030 marks.   From Aug. 24 to Sept. 2, the Fed bought a total of $389.5million against the Japanese yen as the dollar sank to around140 yen, according to the report. At about this time, the Fedalso purchased $50 million against the mark as the dollarfell below 1.80 marks, the report said.   In a three-day period beginning Oct. 27, the Fed purchased$395 million against the mark and $65 million against the yenas the dollar came under pressure again. Dollar-selling inthe market had intensified then because of reports that theU.S. sought a weaker dollar.</TEXT></DOC>
