The rating concern said it based the upgrade, todouble-A-3 from single-A-1, on ATandamp;T's recent reorganizationinto a &quot;much more efficient and competitive business entity .. . {and its} ongoing cost reduction programs.&quot; Moody's saidthe steps would improve profit and cash flow, noting thatATandamp;T has put most of its large restructuring costs behind it.</LP><TEXT>   An ATandamp;T spokesman said of the action by Moody's, &quot;Theyreflect the same optimism we have.&quot;   The new rating isn't the highest ever at ATandamp;T. In 1982,when the company still owned and ran the Bell System, itssenior debt was rated triple-A-3.   Moody's said on March 12 that it was considering theupgrade, which includes ATandamp;T Euronotes and Eurobonds andsenior debts of ATandamp;T Credit Corp. and ATandamp;T Technologies Inc.,which are guaranteed by the parent.   Moody's on Feb. 1 confirmed its single-A-1 rating for thetelecommunications company.   The latest announcement said ATandamp;T's reorganization,together with cost-cutting, will result in &quot;enhancedprofitability and more predictable cash flow protection fordebt.&quot; Cash flow is net income plus depreciation. Moody'ssaid it assumes that new pricing flexibility being allowed bythe Federal Communications Commission for long-distanceservices will continue.   Moody's said it expects that ATandamp;T's debt will remainrelatively high during the intermediate term, as the companycontinues to spend heavily for global competition throughinternal growth and acquisitions in both its manufacturingbusinesses and financial services.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,ATandamp;T shares closed at $40.375, down 50 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
