Mixed-mode PISCES-SPICE, circuity-devicesimulations were conducted and the calculated LET threshold comparedfavorably to experimental data. Analysis with the two-dimensional finiteelement PISCES code has revealed the upset charge collection mechanisminvolves charge multiplication due to bipolar action.</TEXT></DOC>
