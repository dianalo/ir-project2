The measure approved Tuesday by the Senate Small BusinessCommittee is intended to insulate the program ``from the politicalhijinks which have plagued it over the years,'' said committeechairman Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.   ``We don't want any more Wedtech scandals,'' he said.   Bumpers cited the numerous bribery and influence-peddlingindictments stemming from the Wedtech Corp.'s successful attemptsto win no-bid contracts from the Reagan administration.   The committee approved a fiscal 1989 reauthorization of SmallBusiness Administration programs at approximately the same fundinglevel as this year, $5.3 billion, with inflationary increases forSBA salaries and expenses.   But it also voted to change the rules under which certaingovernment procurement contracts are set aside for companies ownedand controlled by women and members of minority groups.   Since there is no competitive bidding, the program has comeunder sharp criticism and public scrutiny because of the Wedtechcase and other scandals.   The Senate measure requires that companies show that 30 percentof their business comes from competitive contracts outside theprogram after five years to be eligible for new contracts in thesixth year. The percentage remains the same in year six, butincreases to 50 percent for the seventh and eighth years ofparticipation. A House version of the bill also calls for a varyingmix of competitive contracts but only recommends that they be goalsand not requirements.   Both versions provide that contracts can be terminated by thegovernment if the business is quickly transferred or sold; theSenate bill applies that provision to the initial year of thecontract.   The committee also approved amendments requiring a yearlycertification of ownership. Among the allegations in the Wedtechcase is that the company continued to seek the preferential SBAcontracts even though it was no longer minority-controlled.   Wedtech, a South Bronx military contractor, was awarded morethan $250 million in no-bid contracts in just four years. It wasfrequently cited by Reagan administration officials as a minoritybusiness success story, but the bribery and influence-peddlingallegations subsequently led to five different state and federalcriminal investigations.   Among those under indictment is E. Robert Wallach, a longtimefriend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Meese has acknowledgedinterceding on Wedtech's behalf on a no-bid Army contract, but hedenies any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
