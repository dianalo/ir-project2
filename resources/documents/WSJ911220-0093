An absurdlyunfair and inequitable negotiating situation? Clearly it is.Nevertheless, a relatively analogous situation is now takingplace in the form of negotiations between communistguerrillas and the democratically elected government of ElSalvador.   Negotiations between these two partners have been going onunder U.N. auspices for months now. Perhaps a resolution isin sight. Perhaps not. But regardless of the outcome, manypeople here look on at the process of these negotiations withgrave concern. Negotiators meet in fancy hotels in resorttowns around the world. They develop a mildly civil rapportwith each other. The international press gives equal coverageto both sides. In fact, the Dec. 11 New York Times reportedon negotiations between &quot;the rightest government and theleftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,&quot; as ifthey were equal partners in a debate.</LP><TEXT>   But they are not equal partners. One side was elected togovern in free and fair elections. The other side, when ithas bothered to run, usually polls less than 10% of the vote;has failed to win any popular support for its militaryoffenses; has increasingly failed to attract large crowds forits &quot;front-group&quot; demonstrations; has failed to overcome themilitary resistance to its armed raids; and has failed in itsdecade-long attempt to gain power by holding an entire nationhostage with terrorism, sabotage, intimidation and a massive,world-wide propaganda campaign.   Eleven years ago, several armed Marxist groups werefighting independently in El Salvador. They had fought sideby side with the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, inspired by theslogan &quot;Nicaragua today, El Salvador tomorrow.&quot; When theSalvadoran guerrillas appealed to Fidel Castro for supportfor a final offensive that would crush the Salvadoranmilitary and bring them to power, he told them to unite. Thisthey did, and they received enormous logistical and strategicsupport from Castro.   The FMLN's 1980 &quot;final offensive&quot; failed because at thelast minute President Jimmy Carter, fearing anotherNicaragua, sent military support to the Salvadoran army,which had just enough ammunition to hold out for another 24hours. With U.S. economic and military aid, the country wasable to withstand the aggression. While the FMLN receivedtons of weapons from Cuba via Nicaragua, even more importantwas the organization world-wide of a corps of &quot;solidarity&quot;groups to carry out one of the most successful psychologicalwarfare campaigns ever waged.   Activist groups everywhere lobbied for the U.S. to cut offthe military aid that had deprived the Marxist guerrillas ofa military victory in 1980. They were enormously successfulin raising money, especially in Catholic and Protestantchurches that had accepted the notion of &quot;LiberationTheology.&quot; (Salvadoran intelligence officials estimate thatno less than $30 million a year still flows from thesesources to the FMLN leadership.) They found supporters in theU.S. Congress and among European governments. At one timeMexico and France recognized the FMLN as a legitimatepolitical force, but they later reversed these positions.   The most heinous development of the psychological warfarewas the sacrificing of human lives as &quot;propaganda fodder&quot; todiscredit the army and the succeeding governments. Grislyphotographs of corpses appeared on the covers ofnewsmagazines in full color. The government and army of ElSalvador were always blamed for the atrocities. It would befalse to say that the army was blameless, but it certainlywas not responsible for every crime of which it was accused.On the other hand, the subversives did not suffer at thehands of the press for crimes they occasionally even boastedof having committed; they were treated as heroes by theliberal press and often still are.   A strengthened and reformed army modernized itself anddashed any hopes of an FMLN military victory. And democracytook root in El Salvador, as it did throughout thehemisphere, giving even less justification to the guerrillas'cause. When the possibility of a military victory began tofade, the FMLN placed greater hopes on winning at thenegotiating table what it could not win in elections or onbattle fields. The FMLN's every action was aimed atsupporting psychological warfare, which internally meantterrorizing the people with sabotage and murder, andexternally, denigrating the army and the government.   By June 1989, when Alfredo Cristiani was electedpresident, serious talks were under way to achieve the&quot;negotiated political solution&quot; the FMLN had long clamoredfor. The FMLN again showed its duplicity by unleashing aferocious attack on the most important cities of the nationin November of that year. This attack, which employed manynon-Salvadoran &quot;internationalists,&quot; had been in preparationfor more than two years, even while the peace negotiationswere in progress. Despite the hiatus created by the failedoffensive, the peace negotiations continued.   But political circumstances had changed. While PresidentCristiani had focused from the outset on the &quot;negotiatedpolitical solution,&quot; he made it clear that the governmentwould not concede the FMLN's more egregious conditions forpeace, such as turning the police over to the guerrillas oraccepting an armed cease-fire that would allow guerrillas tokeep their weapons and control territory they claimed tohold.   International hopes for peace before Christmas 1991 werenevertheless high as U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez deCuellar became anxious to resolve the conflict before histerm expired at year's end. He offered to intervenepersonally, and invited both parties to meet with him at theU.N. in New York. These talks are currently in progress.   Despite the urgent desire of Mr. Perez to close his termof office with a triumph, President Cristiani has said: &quot;Wereject a peace forced on us and refuse to make concessions atgunpoint.&quot; The FMLN must now either disarm and demobilizeunder U.N. supervision, or keep on fighting. The rebel leaderrepresenting the Communist Party, Shafik Handal, said hecould not conceive of disarming: &quot;Disarming is a concept thatinvolves a defeat or a victory.&quot; The FMLN's brutal militarycommander, Joaquin Villalobos, enlarged Mr. Handal'sstatement when he rejected the historic militaryinterpretation of a cease-fire as laying down of arms anddemobilizing, saying: &quot;It would be a surrender, and we havenot been defeated.&quot;   The FMLN persists in maintaining the great hoax that itrepresents something other than raw ambition for power thatit can not attain through the ballot box. In truth it is morelike the armed gang that invades a private home and thenwants to negotiate with the legal owner as to what sectionsof the home it can have.   ---   Mr. Rosenthal is publisher and editor of the El SalvadorNews Gazette.</TEXT></DOC>
