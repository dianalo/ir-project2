At the same time, the Defense Department lifted the suspensionof contract payments on six military projects involving ninecompanies that Carlucci on July 1 ordered frozen based on evidencefrom affidavits in the case unsealed by a federal court in Dallas.   Contracts on the nine programs were valued in excess of $1billion, although work on some of the contracts had already beencompleted.   In a related action, the Pentagon said the Navy ``initiatedaction to suspend without pay George Stone,'' a contractingemployee who allegedly passed along information that may havehelped several companies submit winning bids on military programs.Carlucci had already announced that step.   And ABC News reported Monday night that a woman who worked inthe office of former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn Paisley saysshe was ordered to make copies of classified documents by a seniormilitary aide to the former Pentagon official. Paisley has been atarget of the procurement probe.   ``I said ... this is wrong. We're not supposed to be doing this.We're not supposed to duplicate classified material,'' theunidentified former staffer told the network.   She said she copied the documents on the directions of Paisley'sexecutive aide Capt. Robert Toll.   ``Absolutely false,'' said Toll, who is now retired, in denyingany copying of classified documents.   ABC also said that William Galvin, a defense consultant whosename has also surfaced in the investigation, often visited Paisleyat his Pentagon office but staff members did not note the visit onthe official logs.   Announcement of the banning actions came the day before Carlucciwas scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committeeto explain what actions he was taking on the basis of his July 1announcement.   Carlucci's comments surprised some Navy officials, some membersof Congress and contractors who have sought to determine exactlywhich payments and contractors were involved. Some of the affectedprograms involve dozens of subcontractors, and the legalimplications of Carlucci's action was unclear.   The two companies that were suspended were Varian Continental ofDallas and Acquisition Control of Alexandria, Va., the announcementsaid. The three individuals were Mark Saunders, Thomas E. Muldoon,and Joe Bradley.   The department resumed payment to Unisys in a $712 millionanti-submarine warfare program; to Litton Industries in a $150million program to develop a handheld digital radio transmitter;TRW on the anti-submarine warfare program; ITT on a $51 millionfiber optics program; Continental Electronics on a $6.3 millionvery low frequency transmitter; Loral Terracom and CanadianCommercial on a $49 million radio program; and Hughes Aircraft andRaytheon Corp. on a $38 million carrier combat direction system.   Earlier Monday, Charles Bowsher, head of the congressionalGeneral Accounting Office, told the Senate Armed Services Committeethat Carlucci should hold off on suspending contracts or debarringcontractors while the probe is under way.   ``It might be better to let the investigative process work,''Bowsher said. Later, if there are indictments, those contractscould be suspended and if there are convictions, the contractorscould eventually be debarred, he noted.   When he suspended the payments, Carlucci was under politicalpressure to demonstrate that he was working to clean up themilitary procurement system, widely criticized as a result of theinvestigation.   Carlucci, in his announcement on July 1, said he had initiatedsuspension procedures against Stone, Saunders, Bradley and theContinental Electronics division of Varian Associates Inc.   According to the affadivits released a day earlier, FBI agentseavesdropped as Stone read to Saunders, a consultant, the secretbids from 10 companies competing for a $120 million AdvancedTactical Air Command and Control system. Payment on that projectwas resumed Monday.   Saunders is a former Navy procurement officer convicted of andfired for stock trading on insider Navy information in 1982. TheFBI said Saunders was receiving inside contract data from Stone,his Navy successor, and it ``believes that Saunders is paying Stonefor this information.''   Stone was one of six Pentagon officials transferred to otherduties after their offices were searched.   Bradley was placed on administrative leave from his job as vicepresident for marketing of Varian Continental, of Palo Alto,Calif., according to a company spokesman.   Muldoon, a former employee of the Unisys plant in Great Neck,N.Y., later set up his own consulting firm in Washington withclients including Litton, Hazeltine and Emhart. According theaffadavit unsealed in Dallas, Muldoon paid Saunders $4,000 out ofan $8,000 monthly retainer from Litton in exchange for contractinformation.</TEXT></DOC>
