The pilots' union said its members at other airlines would followall safety rules to the letter again today, at whatever cost inservice delays. The clearest effect on travel, however, was atEastern, which was forced to lay off 9,500 employees this week andground most flights because of pilots' support of the 8,500-memberMachinists union strike over Eastern's demand for contractconcessions.   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis denied Eastern'srequest for a temporary injunction forcing the airline's 3,600pilots to return to work, despite warnings from Eastern's attorneythat the company faced imminent bankruptcy proceedings if pilotsweren't forced to cross picket lines.   The airline flew just 57 flights of its Northeast Shuttle onTuesday, and 41 flights were used to return stranded planes to homebases from South America and other points, Eastern spokesman JimAshlock said today. Before the strike, Eastern had more than 1,000flights daily.   Eastern, which has only 1,500 employees of a pre-strike workforce of 31,200 still working and contends it has ``no business onthe books,'' said it planned to file an appeal this afternoon withthe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the option to file forprotection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws remains ``acourse of last resort.'' However, some union leaders have contendedthat Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern owner Texas Air Corp., hasplanned all along to tear the carrier apart.   ``Mr. Lorenzo has obviously not got the trust and confidence ofhis company. A company doesn't work unless it's a team,'' U.S.Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said today on CBS' ``ThisMorning.''   ``Congress can't get involved and the president can't getinvolved. You don't create a working relationship between a companyand its employees by congressional act and you can't keep lettingthe situation deteriorate,'' Skinner said.   The pilots union reported that Eastern management called itsnegotiators Tuesday evening to try to set up new talks for theircontract, which expired in June 1988. Union spokesman J.B. Stokessaid today that the contact ``was just a telephone conversation, acontact. We're officially supposed to meet March 9.''   The ruling in Miami against Eastern, is ``a victory for labor ingeneral,'' Eastern pilots' leader Jack Bavis told a raucous rally ofnearly 3,000 striking employees gathered downtown Tuesday night fora teleconference beamed by satellite to 11 other groups across thecountry.   ``All of us or none of us!'' chanted the crowd of strikers whojammed Miami's Knight Center.   Earlier, about 200 non-union workers, most of them among thoselaid off this week, demonstrated on company property across frompickets, shouting ``We want our pilots back!''   About 60 percent of the 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Associationon Tuesday followed its request that rule books be stringentlyobserved, said Capt. Roger Hall, a union spokesman.   The job action began Tuesday and could cause major flight delaysaround the country, but Hall said, ``the reports we have are thatthere has been no effect on operations.''   There were minor delays in arrivals at La Guardia Airport in NewYork this morning that might have been caused by a pilots' slowdown,said Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New Yorkand New Jersey. This morning, no major delays were reported atO'Hare International Airport in Chicago.   ``There have been sporadic requests for special handling byflight crews,'' said FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein. ``The number isvery few. ... It hasn't disrupted the system.''   President Bush, meanwhile, refused to budge from his oppositionto government intervention to halt the walkout that the Machinistsunion, representing mechanics and ramp service workers, beganSaturday.   A U.S. House panel, however, approved a bill that would compelBush to appoint an emergency board to study the 17-month contractdispute and issue a recommendation. The action would include acooling-off period of up to 60 days in which striking employeeswould return to work.   Pilot leaders were trying to get support for the bill, which isnot expected to reach the House floor before next week. Lawmakersconcede there are not enough votes in Congress to override anexpected presidential veto.   Bush told reporters the strike at Eastern, the nation'sseventh-largest airline, should be settled through bargaining. Andthe president said if the Machinists try to shut down rail servicelater this week, he will ask Congress to ban such secondary boycotts.   Secondary boycotts, particularly in the New York metropolitanarea, could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people.   Unions representing workers at three suburban New York rail lineshave appealed a federal judge's order issued last weekend barringthem from honoring any Machinist picket lines set up at railways.The judge has extended his order, originally set to expire thisafternoon, through Friday.   A three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals heardarguments this morning and later refused to lift an order barringcommuter railroad workers in the New York area from honoring anypicket lines set up by striking Machinists.   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson ``was wrong in enjoiningunions from engaging in secondary boycotts,'' said Machinists lawyerJoseph Guerrieri Jr. ``The unions are free to engage in a full rangeof secondary activities.''   Appeals court Judge Irving R. Kaufman noted, ``Whatever we do,really, is meaningless because you're going right to the SupremeCourt _ either side _ won't they?'' The lawyer for two of therailroads conceded that was likely.   Eastern, which carried 100,000 passengers on 1,040 flights dailybefore the strike, has continued operating only its shuttle betweenWashington, New York and Boston, and three round trips weeklybetween Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.   The airline wants $150 million in concessions; the Machinistswant $50 million in raises. Eastern has said it lost more than $1billion this decade and $1 million a day before the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
