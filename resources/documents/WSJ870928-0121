RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> USWSTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   U S West Inc., taking advantage of investors' fascination with the cellular-phone business, said it plans to sell 17% of its cellular operation in a public offering.    The Englewood, Colo.-based regional Bell holding company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the proposed sale of 8.4 million Class A common shares in its unit, U S West NewVector Group Inc. According to U S West, the shares are expected to be priced between $20 a share and $23 a share, giving the offering an indicated value of as much as $193.2 million.    As a result of the offering, U S West, the first Baby Bell to take such a step, said it will post a one-time gain of an undetermined amount for the fourth quarter. In last year's fourth quarter, the company earned $205.9 million, or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $2.08 billion. Results included a $52 million charge to retrench operations.    The rapid growth of the cellular-telephone industry over the last year has created a lot of enthusiasm among investors for cellular stocks. Share prices of cellular stocks that have been traded on the public market during all of 1987 are up 85%, compared with a 35% rise for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.'s 500-stock index, said Dennis Leibowitz, cellular analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. He added, &quot;It is clear that the stock market appetite for the industry is very high.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, U S West closed at $58.75, up 87.5 cents. Shares of the other six regional Bells also rose.    The other regional Bells declined to comment or said they have no plans now for a partial offering of their cellular operations, but securities analysts predicted other Bells eventually will follow U S West's move.    U S West's offering follows a similar move earlier last week by Atlanta-based Contel Corp., an independent, or non-Bell, telecommunications holding company. Earlier this month, Chicago-based Telephone andamp; Data Systems Inc., another independent phone company, offered part of its U.S. Cellular Corp unit.    Over the last year, several free-standing cellular companies have also gone public, and the prices investors have been willing to pay for such offerings has risen sharply. The industry's standard formula for establishing the value for cellular properties is based on partly on the population of the particular cellular company's franchise areas. In a recent initial offering by Bellevue, Wash.-based McCaw Cellular Communications Cos., investors paid $21.75 a share, equivalent to about $79 &quot;per pop&quot; -- $79 per potential customer in McCaw's franchise, said Mr. Leibowitz. &quot;Per pop&quot; values have about doubled in the past year, he said.    The cellular industry is still unprofitable, but analysts expect it to grow rapidly. According to Mr. Leibowitz, the number of people subscribing to cellular services is generally running ahead of earlier predictions of a 2% subscription rate among potential customers. The analyst said he now expects 3% of the customers to subscribe, citing, among other things, falling prices for cellular phones.    Other phone companies with cellular operations likely won't be able to resist partially offering their units to the public, analysts said. &quot;I think we are going to see this thing rip through the whole industry,&quot; said Joel Gross, Donaldson's telephone analyst.    Kenneth M. Leon, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co., noted that after a partial offering, the stand-alone unit could become a vehicle for additional acquisitions without causing dilution of the parent company's earnings. Moreover, the earnings of many of the regional Bells are brushing against the earnings cap imposed by regulators, limiting further gains in their share prices. Partial offerings of cellular or other unregulated units, such as yellow pages operations, could highlight the value of the units. Presumably, the stock of the Baby Bell then might rise, the analyst said.    U S West will retain control of NewVector through its ownership of all of the 41.2 million shares of the unit's newly created Class B shares. Each share of Class B stock entitles its holder to 10 votes, while a Class A share has one vote.    NewVector will use the proceeds of the offering for acquisitions, working capital and repayment of a loan from U S West's financial services unit.    In the six months ended June 30, NewVector's net loss swelled to $12.6 million from the year-earlier $2.6 million. Revenue rose about 53% to $46.4 million from $30.4 million. Since June, according to the prospectus, the company has cut staffing, marketing and certain other expenses.    But NewVector anticipates losses and negative cash flow to continue for &quot;at least the next several years,&quot; the prospectus said. </TEXT></DOC>
