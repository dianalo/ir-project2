The collectorenergy equations were cast in a two-dimensional form in order that theheat transfer and thermal capacitance effects can be simulated accuratelyat the small flow rates encountered commonly in these buoyancy-drivensystems. The use of an appropriate non-isothermal friction factor correlationwhen calculating energy losses in the collector's riser pipes, producedpredicted flow rates which were corroborated to within 2% by the valuesmeasured under steady-flow conditions. An indoor-test facility, monitoredand controlled by a microcomputer, enabled &quot;real&quot; operating conditionsto be simulated. The predicted responses of the system to identical conditionsshowed good agreement with the corresponding experimental observations,the predicted heat delivery being within 6% of that measured.</TEXT></DOC>
