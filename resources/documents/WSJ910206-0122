The Methodist church still puts on its ham-and-oysterfeast. The regulars still linger over coffee at Ma's Kettle,just as they've done for years.   But this old mill town has changed in the past decade.There are two new schools. Across the railroad bridge, atract-housing development has transformed fields into aforest of roofs, with a horizon full of chimneys andskylights. There are new streets with names like ThamesmeadeRoad. And Jan Arnold, Savage's only mail carrier, no longercan deliver the whole town's mail by 10 a.m. These days sheisn't done until 5:30 p.m.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I like the idea that we live in the country,&quot; says BobScaggs, a local historian. &quot;But, my goodness, there's lesscountry here than there was before.&quot;   So much less that the Census Bureau is about to classifySavage as an urban area, eradicating the only slice of ruralland separating the Washington, D.C., and Baltimoremetropolitan areas. With the entire 35-mile stretch betweenthe two center cities likely to be deemed urban, businessleaders in both cities are pressing the White House Office ofManagement and Budget to declare Washington and Baltimore onehuge metropolitan area -- what is technically called a&quot;combined metropolitan statistical area,&quot; or CMSA.   Such a decision would instantly create the nation'sfourth-largest market and, its backers hope, a marketingbonanza. Other areas have found that consolidatingmetropolitan areas for marketing purposes can have a hugebenefit.   In Massachusetts, Lawrence and Salem, two medium-sizedcities north of Boston, now are marketed as part of theBoston/Lawrence/Salem area, making them part of the nation's10th-biggest market. Together, Dallas and Fort Worthconstitute the seventh-biggest market. And now that Buffaloand Niagara Falls constitute one market, developmentofficials in Buffalo can tout their area as a tourism mecca.   Over the years, such designations have had big impact onsuch diverse activities as cellular-phone marketing,transportation programs and federal spending. A decade ago,after the last census, Republican Sen. Robert Dole of Kansasslipped a 25-word amendment through Congress to include ruralHarvey County in the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area,permitting the county's three hospitals to be eligible forMedicare reimbursement under an advantageous urban formularather than under a less-generous one used for rural areas.   A budget-office decision on the Washington-Baltimore areashas historic implications. &quot;If Washington and Baltimore docombine, it will be the largest such consolidation in worldhistory,&quot; says Richard Forrestal, chief of thepopulation-distribution branch of the Census Bureau. &quot;Thereis no other case where urban areas of this size have growntogether to the point where they could be considered a singlemetropolitan area.&quot;   Backers of the consolidation expect that the newpopulation numbers that are now beginning to trickle out ofthe Census Bureau will only prove what residents of the twocities -- and those here in Savage, in the middle -- alreadyknow: Suburban sprawl and commuting patterns have blurred thelines between the Baltimore and Washington areas. And nowthey are hoping for a federal ruling acknowledging that thetwo metropolitan areas -- covering 6,948 square miles in 17counties and traversed by 22,000 miles of public roads -- areone.   A budget-office ruling favoring the combination would haveimplications that would reach into every one of the estimated2.4 million households in the region. &quot;It would help -- a lot-- in efforts to attract international firms and capital,&quot;says William Wrench, a Northern Virginia developer who ispresident of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. &quot;It'spretty simple: It's a lot easier to sell the fourth-biggestmarket.&quot; (Washington is now the sixth-biggest market in thecountry and Baltimore is the 16th.)   Local business leaders believe they would be able to luremore development and retail activity to the area and forgenew trade links abroad. &quot;Fireworks aren't going to go offwhen this happens and the rivers are still going to flow inthe same direction,&quot; says Robert Grow, deputy director of theWashington-Baltimore Regional Association. &quot;But we'll have abig marketing advantage.&quot;   Many of these same business leaders lobbied the budgetoffice a decade ago, only to find that the two metropolitanregions didn't meet the bureaucrats' standards. But they areconfident that this time will be different. Indeed, a singlesquare mile area of Savage that a decade ago was home tofewer than 300 souls now holds 10 times that many -- far morethan the 1,000 per square mile that the Census Bureau uses todefine an urban area.   The census statistics underline important changes that aretransforming the region. &quot;It used to be that you kneweveryone in town,&quot; says Agnes Riley, a lifelong Savageresident who is the bookkeeper and secretary at a localreal-estate company. &quot;Now you don't.&quot;   The spillover from Baltimore and Washington, combined withworkers from Fort Meade, a nearby Johns Hopkins Universitylaboratory and a National Security Agency installation, havegiven the town a different look. The Bowling Brook Farmsdevelopment is full of young women going to aerobics classesin pink sweat suits and couples that shoo their children upthe pressure-treated wood steps, onto the deck and into thedoor at dusk.   &quot;This was a very small blue-collar town,&quot; says Bobby RayMitchell, who as a boy went to class in the old red-brickschoolhouse up the road. &quot;People's fathers and grandfathersworked in the mill together. Today the town is full of newpeople. We even have the yuppie crowd.&quot;   But even if Savage, the missing urban link, has gonemetro, the notion of one Baltimore-Washington area seemsjarring to many people. One city is famous for its sausageand crab cakes, the other for its quorum calls and conferencecommittees. One dotes on its steamed mussels, the otherworships political muscle.   &quot;You only have to get in your car and drive around to seethat these areas are integrated,&quot; says Paul Groves, ageographer at the University of Maryland. &quot;But they are notunified. The two center cities have different characters andare in different political jurisdictions. And much of thearea between the two cities is not densely populated at all.&quot;   Some Washingtonians fear the budget-office decision couldderail the city's effort to win its own major-league baseballteam. If the two cities are part of one metropolitan area,they say, baseball's paladins could argue that Washingtonalready has a team: the Baltimore Orioles.</TEXT></DOC>
