It establishes the complex interplay betweenradiation damage, hardness, surface stress and, for the first time, friction.For sapphire, both the shallow indentation hardness response and theintegrated near-surface stress increase with damage and exhibit maximaas the surface eventually amorphizes. For the glass, initial damage isshown to result in structural softening before rehardening at higherdoses; the radiation-induced stress is a complex function of dose andseems partly linked to electronic rather than displacement processes.Some structural change also eventually occurs akin to amorphization incrystals and is accompanied by changes in hardness and surface stress.Superimposed on these patterns of behaviour are changes in the frictionbehaviour, part of which is ascribed to increased adhesion presumed dueto implantation changing the surface affinity for water adsorption. Theseeffects are demonstrated and discussed in the context of ion-implantedceramics finding application as controlled friction and/or wear componentsin engineering applications. Other effects such as gas bubble formation,crazing and sputtering are shown to lead to surface microstructures whichcan also play a deleterious role in tribological behaviour.</TEXT></DOC>
