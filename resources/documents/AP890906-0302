Skinner said one of the department's top priorities has beenscrutinizing the proposed takeover of Northwest Airlines by LosAngeles investor Alfred Checchi. He said his staff will add Unitedto its watch list.   Skinner said he should have a better idea in a couple of weeksabout what, if any, action his department should take on the buyouttrend. He said he may make some recommendations to President Bush.   The transportation secretary recently expressed concern aboutpotential foreign involvement in U.S. airline takeovers. BritishAirways PLC is expected to help finance the $300-a-sharelabor-management UAL buyout offer.   The $6.75 billion offer for Chicago-based UAL is spearheaded byUnited pilots who belong to the Air Line Pilots Association. The bidFriday topped the $6.19 billion offered last month by Los Angelesinvestor Marvin Davis.   Skinner told reporters he and other Transportation Departmentofficials also will meet with representatives of United's Machinistsunion, which has expressed skepticism over the labor-managementbuyout plan.   John Peterpaul, general vice president of the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said United isn'tworth what's being offered for it and that the huge amounts thatwould be borrowed to finance a buyout could put the airline injeopardy.   ``You're talking about a lot of debt,'' Peterpaul said. ``You'retalking about an astronomical load for United to carry into thefuture. And we don't see this future as rosy as a lot of people seeit.''   The Machinists, representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 employees,have supported recapitalization as a way to fight Davis.   The pilot-management proposal, which would create the nation'slargest employee-controlled company, is based solely onparticipation of United's 6,300 pilots, though the pilots have saidthey would like all employees to participate.   Officials of the Association of Flight Attendants, whichrepresents 12,700 United workers, say they remain open to discussingparticipation in a buyout.</TEXT></DOC>
