Don't squander your time campaigning all around the country, he told the president. Instead, stir up your own residual popularity, motivating voters in a handful of critical states.    Mr. Reagan has taken that advice, and now is giving his vice president what Mr. Nixon didn't get from President Eisenhower in 1960: a full-fledged partner in the campaign.    Ronald Reagan's assistance to George Bush is evident on all fronts, from cabinet appointments to legislative decisions and the president's own campaign trips. &quot;I don't remember anything comparable&quot; in scope, says the presidential historian Richard Neustadt of Harvard University. Even when President Truman tried to help elect Adlai Stevenson, &quot;Truman did it because he said (Stevenson) is running like a dry creek . . . it wasn't the kind of warm, willing helpfulness that Reagan is giving.&quot;    President Reagan feels he has almost as much at stake in this election as Mr. Bush does, because the outcome will be seen as a test of the durability of the Reagan agenda. &quot;Obviously, getting Bush elected is the Reagan legacy, in the final analysis,&quot; says Edward Rollins, a former White House political adviser.    By far Mr. Reagan's most important contribution to the Bush campaign is the president's own popularity, GOP analysts say. Polls show that Mr. Reagan's job approval rating is the foundation for Mr. Bush's political strength.    &quot;People feel better about Reagan, and therefore they feel better about Bush,&quot; concludes Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization. &quot;They have less of an appetite for change.&quot;    The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, conducted Sept. 16-19, shows that an overwhelming majority of those who approve of Mr. Reagan's job performance also support Mr. Bush for president. Thus Mr. Reagan can be most helpful by &quot;remaining popular, tending the store and continuing to do the job as president,&quot; according to White House political director Frank Donatelli.    But the president is hardly stopping there; indeed, he has mobilized -- and politicized -- his entire White House in the effort to elect Mr. Bush.    In some cases, he has stretched his own political positions to accommodate the Bush political agenda. For example, the president decided recently to release money he had withheld from the United Nations, a payment Mr. Bush advocated. The president allowed to become law a bill requiring advance plant-closing notification for employees, a measure that drew an emphatic presidential veto when it was part of an earlier trade bill. His veto of the first defense authorization bill was clearly designed to seize the defense issue for the GOP campaign. And Mr. Reagan also overcame his early reservations about a measure compensating Japanese-Americans for their internment during World War II.    White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein talks on the telephone at least once a day with James Baker, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman. For months, all appointments and legislative decisions have been coordinated with the Bush campaign. Mr. Reagan has asked his cabinet secretaries to campaign, when appropriate, for the vice president.    In fact, Mr. Reagan's three most recent cabinet appointments -- Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos -- were all recommended by Mr. Bush; Mr. Cavazos's appointment fulfilled, in advance, the vice president's campaign promise to appoint the first Hispanic cabinet member.    Mr. Duberstein insists that &quot;what Reagan is doing is consistent with what he's always done.&quot; But it also is evident that Mr. Duberstein -- who might be a candidate for a cabinet job in a Bush administration, and in any event would like to maintain good relations if he returns to his lucrative lobbying career -- and the rest of the president's aides are keenly aware of how their actions could affect Mr. Bush's race.    &quot;In the next seven weeks, anything that Reagan could accomplish that would hurt Bush wouldn't be worth the price,&quot; says Mr. Rollins, the former Reagan aide.    Mr. Reagan is helping not only within the White House, but outside on the campaign trail. Since Labor Day, he has been campaigning two days a week, focusing on target states such as Michigan, California, Missouri, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and Florida. These states fit the campaign formula set out by Mr. Nixon and by Mr. Reagan's political advisers: They are rich in electoral votes, reservoirs of Reagan popularity and swing states that tend to fluctuate between the two parties.    Mr. Reagan had no coattails in 1984 when he was at the top of the ticket; Republicans gained only 14 House seats and lost two Senate seats. Thus, some wonder how big an effect he can have this year, when his name is nowhere to be found on the ballot. But in a national race, the GOP pollster Richard Wirthlin asserts, the president can &quot;rally the marginal voter to cast a ballot.&quot; He also can help among voters where Mr. Bush is a tough sell; today, for example, Mr. Reagan will be campaigning in Chicago's ethnic wards.    Mr. Reagan's trips also raise huge sums of money for the state Republican party organizations. Last week, during a one-day swing to Waco, Texas, and Houston, for example, Mr. Reagan raised more than $4 million, according to GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf.    First lady Nancy Reagan, who has never warmed up to the vice president and who in the past worried about scheduling too much travel for her 77-year-old husband, isn't putting the brakes on this time. Aides say she views his trips as campaigning for his own place in the history books. Besides, Mr. Reagan enjoys these campaign trips as a chance to get out of Washington, talk about his administration's accomplishments and tell Hollywood stories to carefully screened, wildly enthusiastic crowds. &quot;It's like a rejuvenation&quot; for the president, Mr. Fahrenkopf says.    The Bush campaign has handled Mr. Reagan's role carefully. Joint campaigning has been kept to a minimum; Mr. Bush has a hard time coming off as presidential himself when he is in the presence of his mentor. But the Bush forces seldom pass up an opportunity to take advantage of the White House media glare.    Recently, for example, the White House staged an event specially designed to make Mr. Bush look presidential: He was to swear in the new education secretary in the Oval Office. &quot;Do you know the oath?&quot; Mr. Reagan whispered to the vice president before they turned to face the television cameras. &quot;I think so,&quot; Mr. Bush said with a smile. &quot;But would you prefer I do the pledge of allegiance?&quot;    ---                     The Reagan Factor   &quot;If the election were being held today, would you vote for Bush or Dukakis?&quot;    Likely Voters Who Approve of Reagan's Job Performance                        (53% of total) Bush ............................................ 75% Dukakis ......................................... 14%   Likely Voters Who Disapprove of Reagan's Job Performance                         (40% of total) Bush ............................................. 8% Dukakis ......................................... 80%   The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</TEXT></DOC>
