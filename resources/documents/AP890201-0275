The decision came one day after France's stock exchange watchdogagency, the Commission des Operations de Bourse, said it foundevidence of illegal insider trading in shares of the U.S. companyTriangle Industries Inc. just before its takeover by the Frenchstate-owned metals manufacturer Pechiney SA.   The commission said it could not identify who leaked valuableinformation before the deal was announced, and recommended acriminal investigation.   Edith Boizette, an investigating magistrate attached to theTribunal of Paris, was named to lead the probe.   The commission said Tuesday it found ``serious, precise andconcordant'' indications of illegal activity in the trading ofTriangle shares during the few days after Pechiney had agreed to anoffer of $56 per share, but before the deal was announced on Nov. 21.   Among the investors who bought Triangle stock at around $10 ashare, and made quick profits within a week when the price soared,was Max Theret, a businessman with longstanding ties to theSocialist Party.   Theret's investment company made purchases that were suspicious,the commission said.   Also named in the report was Roger-Patrice Pelat, one ofPresident Francois Mitterrand's oldest and closest friends.   Pelat, his wife and two sons bought 10,000 shares of Trianglestock on Nov. 16 for the equivalent of about $100,000, and resold itin three installments on Nov. 22, 23 and 28, making about $450,000.   In another development Wednesday, the commission said it openedan investigation into suspected trading irregularities in the sharesof the French bank Societe Generale.   The investigation will cover trading since June 1, 1988, and willtry to establish if there was insider trading or if there was anattempt to manipulate the stock price of the bank.   Formerly state-owned, Societe Generale was sold to privateinvestors in 1987 under the privatization program of theconservative government then in power. The Socialists contend thatfriends of then-Premier Jacques Chirac were handed control of thebank.   The Socialist government, in office since last May, has deniedopposition charges that it was behind a takeover attempt on SocieteGenerale in a covert bid to reestablish state control of the bank.   Last month, the government was embarrassed when Industry MinisterRoger Fauroux, one of the non-Socialist members of Cabinet, wasquoted as saying the Societe Generale affair was ``much moreserious'' than the Pechiney-Triangle case and that the stockexchange commission should have investigated it.   Even so, Commission Chairman Jean Ferge said as recently asTuesday that no decision to open an inquiry had been made.</TEXT></DOC>
