But Subroto was quoted by a United Arab Emirates newspaperMonday as rejecting speculation that he had failed to convince thetwo countries to curb their output amid over-production by somemembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The Al-Ittihad daily quoted Subroto, now in Qatar for talks oncurbing over-production, as saying after visiting Tehran andBaghdad last week that he ``now fully knows what the two countrieswant.''   Both countries, economically drained by their 8-year-old war,are now giving top priority to post-war reconstruction funded bytheir oil revenues.   ``This means that the two countries are keen to have a strongand cohesive OPEC and get a good price for their oil,'' Subroto wasquoted as saying.   The Middle East Economic Survey, published in Nicosia, said thatSubroto's mission to Tehran and Baghdad was ``no doubt useful interms of getting acquainted with the positions and preoccupationsof the parties.''   But the weekly said Subroto's talks did not appear to have``yielded any concrete results'' in settling the Iran-Iraq quotaproblem.   Iraq has refused to accept an OPEC quota of 1.5 million barrelsa day and is demanding parity with Iran, which has a quota of 2.369million barrels a day. OPEC's 11 other members agree that Iraqshould have parity.   Although neither side has publicly announced the outcome ofSubroto's talks, Tehran Radio stressed shortly before Subrotoarrived in the Iranian capital that Iran would never agree to allowIraq an equal quota.   ``The allocation of an equal quota for Iran and Iraq is entirelyunprincipled ... Quota parity with Iran is in fact a kind ofincrease in the Iraqi quota,'' the radio commentary noted.   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industrynewsletter, said the key questions in the thorny quota problem werewhether or not the Iranians are prepared to accept the principle ofquota parity with Iraq and whether ``Iraq itself is willing toaccept such a quota and the production discipline it entails.''   The weekly added: ``Neither side, it appears, was in any mood toanswer such awkward questions or even to discuss them in anythingbut very general terms.''   It said that the Iranians ``seemed concerned to steer clear ofthe parity dilemma altogether'' in their talks with Subroto,Indonesia's former energy minister.   ``Instead they concentrated on the broad spectrum of problemsfacing OPEC at present _ particularly over-production by certainmember countries _ and Iran's pressing requirements forreconstruction in the post-war era,'' it said.   The newsletter also said the Iraqis stressed theirreconstruction needs and ``made it plain to Subroto that in theirview the question of Iraq's quota is only one of a wide spectrum ofimportant issues facing OPEC.''   The newsletter noted: ``It would seem ... that, despiteSubroto's brave endeavors, OPEC still has a long, hard road totravel as regards the Iraqi quota impasse and all its other chronicdisciplinary ailments.''   Iraq's current production is estimated at 2.8 million barrels aday, meaning that even if Iran agreed to quota parity, Baghdad'soutput would be reduced at a time when it wants to boost production.   The other major quota violator is the United Arab Emirates. Ithas said it wants to produce around 1.5 million barrels a day, morethan one-third above its 948,000-barrel quota.   The newsletter reported that U.A.E. ouput soared from 1.45million barrels a day in July to 1.7 million barrels a day lastmonth ``and is programmed to increase still further to 1.95 millionbarrels a day for September.''   That will heighten pressure on OPEC to solve the over-productionproblem, which has helped weaken oil prices from OPEC's benchmarkor $18 a barrel to around $14 or $15.   The weekly reported last week that overall OPEC production wasestimated at 20 million barrels a day, more than 3.5 millionbarrels over the cartel's quota ceiling.   Al-Ittihad quoted Subroto as saying that if peace talks betweenIran and Iraq slowed down ``confidence in the possibility ofattaining peace will lead to a letdown on the market andconsequently prices will slip.''</TEXT></DOC>
