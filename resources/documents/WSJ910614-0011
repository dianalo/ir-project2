Citing concessions made by Pretoria, Baker will soon beginsounding out lawmakers on removing the five-year-old economicpenalties. Administration officials believe they have a goodchance of winning over GOP moderates like Lugar andKassebaum, who led the drive to impose the sanctions andwould be critical to gaining congressional support forlifting them.</LP><TEXT>   But Democrats and anti-apartheid activists are certain tobitterly oppose any such move now. They cite human-rightsgroups' estimates that 600 political prisoners remain inSouth Africa, and warn that although Pretoria is liftingapartheid statutes on segregated living, local governmentsmay pass new laws that have the same effect.   If Bush moves to lift the sanctions, Congress will have 30days to block his action.                                                                                                          ROSTENKOWSKI MAY unveil tax-simplification proposals assoon as next week.   The Ways and Means chairman has been working closely withthe IRS staff to devise his proposal, which will focusespecially on pensions, foreign income and individualreturns. One element would reduce paperwork for families whopay domestic help on-the-books; another would helpmutual-fund shareholders figure profits.   Lobbyists hope the bill will turn into a vehicle for theirpet tax breaks; seeking offsetting increases, they approachformer congressional tax analysts offering to buyrevenue-raising ideas. But Rostenkowski, who remains opposedto moving a major bill this year, doesn't want simplificationbadly enough to accept the add-ons in return.                                                                                                          QUAYLE'S IMAGE-BOOSTING may be starting to pay a fewdividends.   Aides are heartened by a California poll showing that, forthe first time, those with a favorable opinion of himnarrowly outnumber those with a negative view. His Asian andEastern European trips came off without visible gaffes; hemade more than a dozen lobbying calls in the successfuleffort to restore space-station funding.   But he still stands low in public esteem. Chief of staffWilliam Kristol notes that now that the flurry over Bush'shealth problems has died down, the attention being paid toQuayle has settled back down to &quot;normal for a vicepresident,&quot; so &quot;of course his performance isn't allowed tohave as much impact on his image as it should.&quot;   Quayle's Competitiveness Council comes under increasingfire from angry Democrats who accuse him of watering down EPAregulations -- which pleases his conservative backers.                                                                                                          PENTAGON RIVALRIES threaten to erupt over the likelyelimination of several parts of the current commandstructure. Army forces in Europe could end up reporting tothe admiral in charge of the Atlantic fleet; Schwarzkopf'sCentral Command may be merged into a larger structureresponsible for handling contingencies not only in the MiddleEast but all around the globe.                                                                                                          GOING, GOING, GORE? Gore's political intimates worry thathis continuing ambivalence over a presidential run may hurthis chances if he does go for it. &quot;There's a worry that theparade will pass him by,&quot; says an associate. MarylandDemocratic chairman Nathan Landow, who's been close to Gorein the past, says, &quot;I don't think he's changed hiscommitment&quot; to run.                                                                                                          SCUFFLING: The Democratic Leadership Council, sometimesaccused of fostering party factionalism, now has an internaldispute of its own. In a letter, House Whip Gray, the DLCvice chairman, blasts the council's management as&quot;disastrous&quot; and worries that the group is &quot;adopting rhetoricindistinguishable from platform language at Republicanconventions.&quot;                                                                                                          BRADY'S CHOICE to be the new assistant Treasury secretaryfor international affairs is Olin Wethington, aHarvard-educated lawyer who now works for Brady as executivesecretary to the Cabinet's economic policy council. Ifnominated and confirmed, he will replace Charles Dallara.                                                                                                          THORNBURGH'S LIMBO roils waters within the JusticeDepartment.   The potential delay in the Pennsylvania Senate race, andhis desire to remain attorney general until the campaign,reignite grumbling among career Justice bureaucrats about&quot;political opportunism.&quot; Even some political appointeescomplain of being lame ducks indefinitely, unsure of whetherthey should be looking for new jobs.   Deputy Attorney General Barr, credited with having put alid on earlier anti-Thornburgh turmoil, moves swiftly toorder &quot;business as usual.&quot; The uncertainty may boost hischances of succeeding Thornburgh: Though considered a darkhorse lacking political stature, the former Bush CIAsubordinate is seen by some White House officials as bestable to achieve stability at the department.   But the Pennsylvania GOP worries Thornburgh will changehis mind and stay at Justice if voting is postponed.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Gee, thanks: Budget Director Darman hails hisdeparting deputy, lawyer William Diefenderfer, as &quot;the ClarkClifford of his generation.&quot; . . .
