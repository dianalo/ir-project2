Roger Mentz, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, told a House Ways and Means subcommittee, however, that &quot;it would not be wise to get into a wholesale revision&quot; of the laws in this area. The groups, including religious, charitable and educational organizations, are generally exempt from federal income tax and can receive tax-deductible contributions. They are subject to a variety of limits on political activity, however.    Mr. Mentz said Congress might impose an excise tax on tax-exempt organizations that exceed these limits, require such groups to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service the names of other exempt groups with which they are affiliated, and require the disclosure of current or past affiliated organizations when they apply for exempt status. </TEXT></DOC>
