Speaking before about 4,500 women, the 72-year-old president andarmy commander said Chileans will be asked in the plebiscite to say``whether they want President Pinochet to stay, or not.''   Under a 1980 Constitution drafted by the military regime,Chileans will vote in 1988 on whether to approve as president asingle candidate chosen by the military.   Should a plurality vote yes, Pinochet will serve an eight-yearterm starting on March 11, 1989. If most people vote no, an open,competitive presidential election would be scheduled in 1990.   It had been widely believed that Pinochet would be the solecandidate, but Friday's speech at Vina del Mar, a sea resort 75miles northwest of Santiago, marked the first time that heindicated he was seeking re-election.   Pinochet told the crowd Friday that the real question in theplebiscite ``will be whether citizens want the government tocontinue, or not. Whether they want President Pinochet to continue,or not.''   The women replied with a resounding ``Yes.''   According to the constitution, the candidate in the plebiscitewill be chosen by the commanders of the army, the air force, thenavy and the national police. As army commander in chief, Pinochettakes part in the nomination.   Pinochet said the commanders will have ``to decide whether theone who is the president now has done a good job, or a bad job.''   ``It's up to them now to make a decision,'' he told the cheeringaudience.   The navy commander, Adm. Jose Toribio Merino, and the air forcechief, Gen. Fernando Matthei, have repeatedly stated that theywould prefer a civilian candidate. The have also said, however,that should Pinochet resign his army command, he would become acivilian.   No date has been set for the ballot, but officials have hintedit could take place on Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of themilitary coup led by Pinochet that ousted elected PresidentSalvador Allende, a Marxist.   In a statement issued at the end of a three-day closed meeting,the nation's Roman Catholic bishops called Friday on militaryleaders to pick a candidate and choose a date for the plebiscitepromptly.   ``The sooner the date and the candidate are known, the moretransparent will be the process,'' the Chilean Episcopal Conferencesaid.   The bishops also said they hoped the ballot would be ``secret,free and informed,'' that the number of voters be``representative'' and that there be a ``guarantee ofimpartiality'' in the vote count.   ``If these conditions are not met, the plebiscite will lack themoral justness needed to sustain its validity,'' the bishops said.</TEXT></DOC>
