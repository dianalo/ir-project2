It was issued through the archbishop of Canterbury, the MostRev. Robert Runcie, and signed by Frances and David Waite, wife andbrother of Runcie's envoy Terry Waite, and by close relatives ofthe three other missing Britons.   Eight Americans also are held in Lebanon, including Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,who was abducted March 16, 1985, and is the captive held longest.   Most of the hostages are believed in the hands of Shiite Moslemsloyal to Iran. the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pronounced adeath sentence on Rushdie a year ago _ Feb. 14, 1989 _ and thenovelist has been in hiding since.   Monday's statement from the British families said his book hadcaused ``grave offense to Moslems throughout the world,'' andargued that free speech had been upheld by its large sales in hardcover.   Rushdie, 42, a naturalized Briton born to a Moslem family inIndia, has been under police guard at an undisclosed location sinceKhomeini urged Moslems to kill him. The decree was not lifted whenKhomeini died in June.   ``Given the predictably grave damage likely to be caused, webelieve that further publication on the grounds of upholding freespeech would be both misconceived and irresponsible,'' the familiessaid.   Viking Penguin, Rushdie's publishers, reiterated Monday nightthat no decision had been made about a paperback edition.   The relatives' made their appeal the day after a Londonnewspaper published a 7,000-word essay by Rushdie defending hisbook and saying he regretted the offense caused.   British Moslem leaders dismissed the essay, but members ofLondon's literary establishment credited the author with abrilliant defense of free speech.   Family members feel Rushdie has made matters worse for thecaptives.   ``Is it worth it to publish a paperback for this notion offreedom of speech when freedom of individuals and indeed his ownliberty is at stake?'' Waite's cousin, John Waite, asked in atelevision interview. ``If he thinks along those lines, I'm sure hewill feel a spirit of compromise means: Don't publish thepaperback.''   Novelist Martin Amis countered: ``Should we deprive ourselves ofcertain freedoms just to humor terrorists, to make them feelbetter? Stringing up Salman Rushdie would make them feel betterstill. It is not something we consider.''   Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while tryingto win the release of American captives.   The other missing Britons are television journalist JohnMcCarthy, and teacher Brian Keenan, both missing since April 1986,and retired pilot Jack Mann, who vanished last May. Keenan also hasIrish nationality.   They are among 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon, including theeight Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
