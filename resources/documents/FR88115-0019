No. 96-153, section 206, 93 Stat. 1108 (1979)) (the 1979 Act)amended the Public and Indian Housing and Section 8 programs under theUnited States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 d and f, respectively)(the 1937 Act) to provide that the criteria used by project owners, PublicHousing Authorities (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) to selectapplicants for housing assistance must give ``preference to families whichoccupy substandard housing or are involuntarily displaced at the time theyare seeking'' housing assistance. Section 203 of the Housing and Urban-RuralRecovery Act of 1983 (Pub. L. No. 98-181, section 203, 97 Stat. 1178 (1983))(the 1983 Act) later amended these authorities to provide that the selectioncriteria used must give a preference to a third category of families_thosethat ``are paying more than 50 percentum of family income for rent.''Section 203(a)(4) of the 1979 Act also amended section 101 of the Housingand Urban Development Act of 1965 (12 U.S.C. 1701s) (Rent Supplement),by adding a new subsection (k) that provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">In making assistance available under this section, the Secretary shallgive priority to individuals or families who are occupying substandardhousing or are involuntarily displaced at the time they are seeking housingassistance * * *.</ITAG>In addition, section 203(b)(3) of the 1983 Act amended section 101(e)(1)(B)of the Rent Supplement authority by including substantially identical languagefor families paying more than 50 percent of income for rent. As amended,section 101(e)(1)(B) reads in relevant part:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The Secretary shall issue * * * certificates as to * * * (B)whether the individual or family was occupying substandard housing, waspaying more than 50 percentum of family income for rent, or was involuntarilydisplaced at the time it was seeking assistance under this section.</ITAG>Although the rent burden preference is appropriately included in the RentSupplement provision, the amendment adding the preference affected section101(e)(1)(B) only, and not section 101(k), the section that Congress originallyhad enacted to created the preference for those persons occupying substandardhousing or involuntarily displaced. (See section 203(a)(4) of the 1979Act.) However, this rule extends the rent burden preference to personswho qualify for assistance under the Rent Supplement program. In doingso, the Department believes that the rule carries out the intent of Congress,notwithstanding the failure to include the language in section 101(k) ofthe Rent Supplement statute.     The amendments to the Public and Indian Housing and Section 8 programsmade by section 206 of the 1979 Act provide for a ``preference'' to certainclasses of families. The comparable amendment to the Rent Supplement programin section 203(a)(4) of the 1979 Act provides for a ``priority'' to thesame classes of families. The Department has studied the legislative historyto determine whether the Congress intended to impart a meaning to the word``priority'' different from that intended by use of the word ``preference''.Research has shed no light on the legislative intent in this regard. Inview of the apparent unified intent of the several amendments (notwithstandingthat they affect different programs), the Department has treated the wordssynonymously. To avoid ambiguity, the word ``preference'', and not ``priority'',is used throughout the rule.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>For ease of reference, this rule refers to the three statutorypreferences as the ``Federal preferences'' or ``preferences.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Treatment of Certificates and Vouchers</ITAG>Section 8(d)(1)(A) of the 1937 Act specifies that the <T3>owner </T3>is responsible for providing the preferences in the Section8 Existing program_the Certificate, Moderate Rehabilitation, and Loan ManagementSet-Aside programs. In the Loan Management program, the owner is responsiblefor the entire tenant selection process, and the final rule requires thatthe owner give preference as provided in the statute. In the Certificate and Moderate Rehabilitation program, however, the PHA(and not the private owner) plays the key role in the applicant selectionprocess with respect to applying the preferences. In the Certificate program,the PHA selects those to whom it issues Certificates of Family Participationfrom its waiting list; the owner determines whether it will rent to theindividual Certificate-holder. (See 24 CFR 882.209.) Similarly, the ownerof a Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation project generally determines thesuitability of individual applicants that the PHA refers to the owner fromits waiting list. (See 24 CFR 882.514(b).) Even in the unusual case wherethe PHA has no families on its waiting list interested in living in a rehabilitatedproject, and the owner itself solicits applicants, the owner refers allcandidates to the PHA to determine their eligibility, which would includetheir qualification for a preference, if the families referred exceededthe units available. (See 24 CFR 882.514(c).) In order to implement the preferences in the Certificate and Moderate Rehabilitationprograms in a way that carries out the clear Congressional intent in enactingthe preferences and is consistent with the implemention of the preferencesin the other covered programs, the rule imposes the preference requirementsat the point at which applicants are selected from the pool of applicants:<T3>i.e., </T3>when the PHA, rather than the private owner, acts in theprocess. Section 207 of the 1983 Act amended section 8 of the 1937 Act to establishthe Housing Voucher program. Section 8(o)(3) of the 1937 Act requires theuse of the three Federal preferences in selecting recipients of HousingVouchers. The Department has been implementing the Housing Voucher programthrough Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs) published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (See 49 FR 28458 (July 12 1984); 50 FR 8196(February 28, 1985); 50 FR 19475 (May 8, 1985); 51 FR 10932 (March 31,1986); and 52 FR 5250 (February 19, 1987).) Housing Vouchers have beenauthorized in these editions on the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for the following uses: the Rental RehabilitationProgram, A Freestanding Housing Voucher Demonstration, a Small PHA/RuralArea Housing Voucher Demonstration, Section 8 ``Opt-Out'' Projects, Demolitionor Disposition of Public Housing Units, and Formula Allocation to HUD RegionalOffices. Readers should consult the NOFA of February 19, 1987 (52 FR 5250)for a full description of the current Housing Voucher program. The Department published a proposed rule on August 14, 1987 (52 FR 30388)that would add a new 24 CFR Part 887 to codify the Housing Voucher programin the Code of Federal Regulations. The proposed rule seeks public commenton the February 19, 1987 NOFA, as modified by the proposed rule. Underthe proposed rule, a PHA (to the extent it receives an additional allocationof Housing Vouchers) would have to provide Housing Vouchers or Certificatesto lower income families that are displaced from rental rehabilition projectsby physical rehabilitation activities. The application of the preferenceswould otherwise be substantially similar to the implementation of the Section8 Certificate program, as discussed in this final rule, and the readerwishing to become generally familiar with the preference provisions forthe Housing Voucher rule, should review the regulatory text and preamblediscussion for the Certificate program. Following consideration of thepublic comments received on the proposed rule, the Department will publishfinal Housing Voucher program regulations, including provisions to implementthe Federal preferences for that program. It is important to note one change proposed by the Housing Voucher rule.In the past, a PHA could use the additional Housing Vouchers provided byHUD in connection with the Rental Rehabilitation program (RRP) for eligiblefamilies living in RRP projects if, after the rehabilitation, the familieswould have to pay more than 30 percent of their income for rent. Thesefamilies could then use the Housing Voucher to remain in the project, orto move. However, the proposed Housing Voucher rule would make a substantialchange in the rules under which Housing Vouchers allocated in connectionwith RRP can be used. As noted above, the proposed rule would require PHAs to use their additionalallocation of Housing Vouchers to provide rental assistance to eligiblefamilies that would be displaced from their project because of physicalconstruction activities. These additional Housing Vouchers would no longerbe provided to families that are not physically displaced, even if theirrent increased. These families may be eligible for Housing Vouchers froma PHA's waiting list and, if their rent exceeds 50 percent of their income,they would qualify for a preference under today's final rule. Accordingly,an eligible family encountering an increased rent burden in its RRP unit,but who is <T3>not </T3>required by rent increases in the project to pay more than50 percent of income for rent, would not qualify for preferential accessto assisted housing under either the Housing Voucher proposed rule or thisfinal rule (unless, of course, the family qualified for a preference ona basis other than rent burden). As discussed in more detail later, however,PHAs would have discretion to adopt local selection preferences to assistRRP families experiencing post-rehabilitation rent increases. Section 882.209(a)(7) contains a clause not found in the comparable paragraphsfor the other affected programs. This clause provides that the PHA's obligationto select a family from the waiting list is subject to any obligation thePHA may have to ensure the availability of a Certificate for a purposespecified in andSection; 882.209(a)(4)(ii)(B). Under the Housing VoucherProgram, a PHA immediately may use for general Housing Voucher programpurposes (<T3>i.e., </T3>for families on the Housing Voucher Program waiting list)Housing Vouchers that were allocated for Rental Rehabilitation purposes.See 52 FR 5250, February 19, 1987, the Housing Voucher Program Notice.That notice, in explaining the ``immediate use'' provision, requires that<ITAG tagnum="21">[A] PHA may use housing vouchers for general program purposes <T3>before </T3>they are used for rental rehabilitation projects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA may use the housing vouchers for families on its Section 8waiting list, if the PHA determines that it will have an adequate numberof housing vouchers or Section 8 certificates available when needed inconnection with a rental rehabilitation project. The PHA must develop awritten plan to assure this availability. In determining whether this immediateuse is feasible, the PHA must consult with the rental rehabilitation grantee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Id. </T3>at 5253.</ITAG>As a condition to immediate use, however, a PHA must develop a plan toensure the availability of Housing Vouchers <T3>or Certificates </T3>when the rental rehabilitation need arises. Thepurpose of the clause in andSection; 882.209(a)(7) is to enable the PHA toprovide a Certificate to a rental rehabilitation family to meet its obligationcreated by the previous ``immediate use'' of the Rental Rehabilitationallocation Housing Vouchers. The Rental Rehabilitation allocation is theonly special allocation under either the Certificate Program or the HousingVoucher Program that includes the concept of immediate use for generalprogram purposes, and the concommitant obligation to ensure the availabilityof Certificates (or Housing Vouchers) when needed for the purpose for whichthe Certificates (or Housing Voucher were specifically allocated. Nonetheless,the Department has drafted this clause to cover any such situation thatmay arise in the future. When the pending Housing Voucher rule is promulgated, it will similarlyrecognize that, for purposes of ensuring the availability of vouchers allocatedfor Rental Rehabilitation where those vouchers were subjected to an earlier``immediate use'' for other purposes, a PHA may require selection of familiesfor Voucher assistance outside the normal waiting process. The rent-burden preference is to be granted to a family paying more than50 percent of its income for rent ``at the time [the family] is seekingassistance.'' See, e.g., section 8(d)(1)(A) of the U.S. Housing Act of1937. The Department construes this language to mean that the family mustbe rent-burdened at the point that a family is <T3>offered</T3> assistance for a unit, not only at the time that the family<T3>applies </T3>for assistance.However, application of the cited statutory language could work a hardshipon a family occupying a unit being rehabilitated under the Rental RehabilitationProgram (RRP), by requiring that the family first pay the increased post-rehabilitationrent before qualifying for the rent-burden preference. In HUD's view, sucha family should not necessarily have to begin paying the increased rentbefore its preference status could be recognized. Such a requirement wouldbe an unnecessary formalism_especially since the increased rent would havebeen occasioned by the improvements to the family's unit funded by RRP_aprogram administered by HUD.To observe such formalism would work an intolerable hardship on an RRPfamily that has continued to occupy a unit during Rental Rehabilitation,anticipating continued occupancy of the same unit without housing assistance.Upon notification of the post-rehabilitation rent and discovery that therent would exceed 50 percent of family income, the family might well concludethat continued occupancy would only be possible with assistance. Unlessthis family could apply for a preference based on the <T3>anticipation</T3> of increased rent, the RRP activity would have theeffect of requiring the family to pay unaffordable rent for an indefiniteperiod while it awaited qualification for a certificate, voucher, or otherassistance.Also, some eligible RRP families will qualify for a statutory preferenceby virtue of living in substandard housing. Upon being offered assistanceon that basis, this rule's verification procedures would require the familyto demonstrate that its unit <T3>continued </T3>to be substandard at the time assistance became available.If rental rehabilitation activity had caused the family's entitlement tothe substandard housing preference no longer to be verifiable, it wouldbe harsh to refuse a certificate to such a family when the family, in ashort time, was clearly going to qualify for the rent burden preference.To reduce these impacts on RRP families to the extent possible, the rulecreates a limited exception, applicable to the Section 8 Existing HousingCertificate program (Part 882), with respect to the normal applicationand verification procedures associated with the rent burden preference.This exception, appearing in paragraphs (c) and (f) of andSection; 882.219,provides that RRP families who have been advised that their post-rehabilitationrent for the same unit that they are currently occupying will be increasedto more than 50 percent of the family's income will be considered as payingthe higher rent from the date the family is offered assistance, as longas the family would become subject to the higher rent within sixty daysof the offer of assistance. (When the pending Housing Voucher rule is promulgated,it will similarly treat the subject of the rent burden preference as itrelates to Rental Rehabilitation tenants.)The Department is limiting the period during which this presumptive rentburden preference would be operative to sixty days to be consistent withthe requirement in section I.(f)(2)(ii) of Part III of the February 19,1987 Housing Voucher NOFA (52 FR 5250, 5262) that ``housing vouchers ** * must be issued * * * approximately 60 days before the estimated completiondate for the rehabilitation work.''<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Rule</ITAG>On September 26, 1984 (49 FR 37787 (1984)), the Department published aproposed rule to implement the 1979 and 1983 statutory provisions. Thatrule amended regulations affecting 24 CFR Part 215 (Rent Supplement Payments);Part 880 (Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for New Construction);Part 881 (Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for SubstantialRehabilitation); Part 882 (Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program_ExistingHousing), Subparts A and B (Section 8 Certificates), D and E (Section 8Moderate Rehabilitation), and F (Manufactured Home Owners); Part 883 (Section8 Housing Assistance Payments Program_State Housing Agencies); Part 884(Section 8 Housing Assistance Program, New Construction Set-Aside for Section515 Rural Rental Housing Projects); Part 886 (Section 8 Housing AssistancePayments Program_Special Allocations), both Subparts A (Loan Management)and C (Property Disposition); Part 904 (Low Rent Housing HomeownershipOpportunities); Part 905 (Indian Housing); and Part 960 (Admission to,and Occupancy of, Public Housing).The Proposed rule provided for a preference in selection for those applicantswho otherwise were qualified for housing assistance under the program involvedand who, at the time they were seeking assistance, were involuntarily displaced,living in substandard housing, or paying more than 50 percent of theirfamily income for rent. PHAs and owners were required to inform prospectivetenants (including those on the waiting list) of the availability of thepreferences, and to give them an opportunity to show that they qualifiedfor preferred status.The three Federal preferences were given primacy over all local preferencesand priorities. Thus, an applicant who qualified for any one of the Federalpreferences would have been selected to receive housing assistance beforenon-preferred applicants, irrespective of their qualification for one ormore non-Federal (<T3>i.e.,</T3> locally established) preferences or priorities, or theirposition on the waiting list. The preferences were coequal, and no rankingor cumulation of the preferences was permitted.The proposed rule envisaged a two-step approach by which an applicant generallywould qualify for a Federal preference. First, the applicant would <T3>certify</T3> that he or she was in one of the three preferred classeswhen he or she initially applied for housing assistance; before receiptof assistance, however, the applicant had to provide appropriate documentationto the owner or PHA so that the applicant's status in a preferred classat that time could be <T3>verified.</T3>The rule set forth definitions for each of the Federal preferences, anddescribed the procedures that PHAs and owners would apply to verify thatan applicant qualified for a preference. Verification was to be establishedprincipally by documentation supplied by the applicant from third-partysources. While private owners, and PHAs administering Rent Supplement andSection 8 programs (other than 24 CFR Part 882), were bound to follow thedefinitions and verification procedures set out in the rule, PHAs administeringpublic and Indian housing programs, and the Section 8 Existing and ModerateRehabilitation programs under Part 882, were given the discretion to adopttheir own verification procedures, and, subject to HUD's approval, couldapply their own definitions of the Federal preferences.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments</ITAG>The Department received over 130 comments on the proposed rule. The majorityof these comments was critical of the rule, or of one or more of its provisions.As a result of these comments and the Department's ongoing review of thestatutory scheme governing the Federal preferences, the Department hasmade a number of revisions in the proposed rule, which are incorporatedin today's final rule.These revisions are discussed at length below, along with the Department'streatment of the public comments. Briefly, the significant revisions includethe following. The final rule retains the requirement for the Rent Supplementand Section 8 programs (other than the Certificate and Moderate Rehabilitationprograms) that Federal preference-holders will always be considered forhousing assistance before families without a Federal preference, irrespectiveof the latter's qualification for one or more non-Federal preferences.Project owners under these programs will, however, have broad discretion(not provided under the proposed rule) to determine the weight to be assignedeach of the Federal preferences vis-a-vis the other two. Thus, owners mayaggregate or rank the three preferences or their definitional elements(or both), and use State or local preferences as a means of selecting amongFederal preference-holders.PHAs administering the Public and Indian Housing programs and the Section8 Certificate and Moderate Rehabilitation programs will have the same discretionas project owners to determine the weight to be assigned among the Federalpreferences. They will also be permitted, however, to make rental assistanceavailable to families <T3>without </T3>a Federal preference <T3>before</T3> Federal preference-holders, for up to 10 percent of thefamilies initially receiving assistance in any one-year period.The definition of involuntary displacement has been clarified to includesituations in which a landlord has decided not to renew a tenant's lease.Victims of domestic violence may qualify for a preference on grounds ofinvoluntary displacement. Similarly, the definition of substandard housinghas been expanded to include ``homeless'' persons. Finally, the rule addslanguage providing for administrative review of a decision denying an applicationfor a preference.For the convenience of the reader and to better organize the Department'sresponses, the comments are classified according to the general subjectmatter that they addressed, followed by the Department's response to eachcategory of comments.I. Application of the Federal Preferences<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Primacy of the Federal Preferences</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the Department gave the three preferences primacyover all non-Federal preferences. The Department stated its position asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * in the weighting process, an applicant qualifying for any oneof these three preferences would outweigh, and therefore be chosen before,another applicant who does not qualify for one of the three preferences,regardless of the combination or aggregation of other (<T3>i.e.</T3>, State or locally created) preferences enjoyed by the otherapplicant, and without regard to which applicant applied first, or thelength of time the first applicant was on the waiting list. [49 FR 37788-9.]</ITAG>The Department specifically requested comment on the ``effect and proprietyof implementing the three preferences'' in this manner. 49 FR 37788. Thisrequest elicited numerous respones, primarily from PHAs. The overwhelmingmajority of the commenters expressed strong opposition to the provision,particularly insofar as it had the effect of overriding local preferencesfor residents of the community in which the assisted housing is located.One of the grounds for objection to the proposal to make the three preferencespreeminent was that such a policy would be contrary to the Congressionalintent expressed in the Conference Report accompanying the 1979 Act. H.Rep. No. 706, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 55 (1979). Commenters emphasized languagein that Report to the effect that the preferences are intended to <T3>guide</T3> the PHA in selecting tenants_not to permit HUD to directthe selection of certain tenants. Similarly, commenters argued that nothingin the legislation enacted in 1979 and 1983 creating the three preferencessuggests that Congress intended to subordinate local discretion by grantingprimacy to the three preferences. One commenter contended that making thepreferences preeminent would directly contravene the United States HousingAct of 1937, and that there should be no preemption of local prioritieswithout specific direction from the Congress.Some commenters noted their objection less on legal than on practical grounds.It was argued that preemption would cause an undue burden on the lowerincome residents of a jurisdiction, since the PHA, which was establishedto serve the low-income residents of that jurisdiction, would be forcedto provide housing for residents of other jurisdictions. A commenter viewedthe proposal as significantly reducing a PHA's ability to tailor housingassistance programs to suit local housing conditions. This commenter urgedthat PHAs be given maximum flexibility to accommodate the three preferenceswithin the pattern of locally established priorities. The commenter stressedthat local preferences should not be thought of as exclusionary; instead,argued the commenter, they facilitate the creation of assisted housingopportunities and accomplish the goal of assisting the needy, with strictadherence to affirmative marketing requirements.Other commenters contended that preemption of local residency preferenceswould threaten the viability of the public housing program, cause participatingcommunities to withdraw from HUD's housing assistance programs, and discouragenon-participating communities from entering the programs. Commenters statedthat local preferences are in the nature of a contract: <T3>i.e., </T3>local communities agree to cooperate in the developmentof assisted housing in return for the assurance that their needy residentswill be served. Commenters believed that the proposed rule violated thatagreement. Finally, State Housing Finance Agencies admonished HUD to recallthe special arrangement that exists between them and HUD with respect tothe level of discretion that they were originally intended to have in carryingout Section 8 programs.The Department has reviewed its original position on the primacy of theFederal preferences in light of the comments, and has determined that PHAsoperating Public and Indian Housing programs and Section 8 Certificateand Moderate Rehabilitation programs may be given some flexibility to devisetenant selection systems that favor applicants without a Federal preferenceover Federal preference-holders.As noted above, the statutory text in neither the 1979 nor 1983 Act shedsdefinitive light on how the preferences should be implemented. The ConferenceReport on the 1979 Act provides the following guidance:<ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees believe that during a period of reduced funding forassisted housing, the programs should be directed toward those familieswho have the most urgent housing needs. The priority is intended to guidethe owner or PHA in determining which potential tenants to select. Thepriority is not intended nor should it be used to allow the Departmentto direct an owner or PHA to select certain tenants. It would be unacceptableand clearly not authorized by this provision for the Department to requirea PHA or owner to select tenants from a list developed by the Department.This provision is not intended to alter the basic responsibility over tenantselection which, under current law, rests solely with the PHA and owner.It is simply intended to have owners and PHAs give priority to meetingthe urgent housing needs of those families living in substandard conditionsor being involuntarily displaced. [H. Rep. No. 706, 96th Cong., 1st Sess.55 (1979).] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>The House Report on the 1979 Act contains substantiallysimilar language. See H.R. Rep. No. 154, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1979).</ITAG>The Department does not consider the language of either the statute orthe Conference Report as <T3>requiring </T3>that the Federal preferences be implemented in a waythat wholly preempts State or local tenant selection preferences. The statuteand legislative history require only that ``preference'' be given to ``families''in one of the three preferred categories. Use of the plural, ``families,''indicates that preference is to be accorded to a <T3>class </T3>of applicants, not to <T3>each </T3>individual applicant. The term ``preference'' can have arange of meanings_from providing some advantage in the selection processto guaranteeing preferred candidates the next available rental assistance.Providing preference to a class of applicants suggests a general mandatethat, unless ``preference'' is construed in its most preemptive sense,may permit some individual non-preferred applicants to take precedenceover preference-holders in the tenant selection process. Given the commenters' overwhelming opposition to the proposed rule's ``primacyof the preferences'' approach, and the lack of legislative guidance onhow to construe the preference provisions, the Department believes thatthe term ``preference'' should not be given such a prescriptive construction.Instead, we believe that the statutory mandate can be satisfied by giving<T3>substantial preference to families in the preferred categories: i.e.,</T3>by ensuring that substantially all preference-holders receive assistanceahead of non-preference-holders, but permitting some non-preference-holdersto go before preference-holders. The Department believes that this approachis not only permissible under the statutory language, but also is responsiveto the Congressional objective expressed in the Conference Report thatHUD's rental assistance programs ``should be directed toward those familieswho have the most urgent housing needs'', as expressed by the preferences.Accordingly, the Department has amended the final rule to permit PHAs operatingPublic and Indian Housing programs, and Section 8 Certificate and ModerateRehabilitation programs, to establish tenant selection systems that permitapplicants without a Federal preference to receive housing assistance aheadof those with a Federal preference. To ensure compliance with the statuteand its legislative intent, however, the rule requires that not more than10 percent of the families that are initially admitted to assistance inthe Public and Indian Housing and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, orthat initially receive a Certificate of Family Participation in the Certificateprogram, may be non-preference-holders that took precedence over familieswith a Federal preference. The 10 percent limit applies only where the PHA has one or more applicantswith a Federal preference, and permits assistance to be given first toa non-preferred applicant. It is possible, especially for smaller PHAs,that no applicant holding a Federal preference will be available when assistanceis to be provided. In this situation, the PHA may make the assistance availableto the non-preference-holder, without counting it against the 10 percentcap. The 10 percent ceiling will be determined for each waiting list that thePHA maintains. This will permit PHAs that have ``merged'' waiting liststo avoid the administrative burden of ensuring compliance with the 10 percentstandard for each program they operate. Performance under the standard will be measured on an annual basis. Thus,PHAs will be responsible for administering their programs so that at theend of each one-year period, the 10 percent limit is not exceeded. Sincesome PHAs may not wish to begin the one-year period when the rule is implemented,but may prefer another starting date (such as the beginning of the PHA'sfiscal year), the rule permits PHAs to select an initial reference periodof less than one year before the start of the first full year under therule. Finally, in fashioning its own system, a PHA may employ the 10 percentexception to carry out preference objectives required by State law or thoseadopted by the PHA itself to advance local policy_for example, a localresidency preference. Additionally, there would be no obstacle to a PHA'sdecision to adopt new local preferences to meet new program objectives.For example, a PHA could provide a local preference for tenants of RentalRehabilitation projects who encounter increased rent burdens in their RentalRehabilitation units, but whose rent burden doesn't reach a level to qualifythe families for a Federal preference. The Department wishes to stress that only the <T3>initial</T3> receipt of assistance for a <T3>family </T3>is counted toward the 10 percent limit. Thus, a familythat moves from one public housing project to another in the same PHA'sjurisdiction, or that moves from a unit assisted under the Certificateprogram and is given a Certificate for a new unit, is not subject to thisrule. As noted above, the 10 percent exception is only available for PHAs operatingcertain programs. Owners (including PHAs) participating in the other Section8 programs must comply with the proposed rule's ``primacy of the preferences''approach: <T3>i.e., </T3>Federal preference-holders must be considered for housingassistance before those who do not qualify for a Federal preference. The Department has two reasons for adopting this bifurcated approach. First,the vast majority of those who commented on the ``primacy of the preferences''feature of the proposed rule were PHAs. Their comments voiced virtuallyunanimous and heated opposition to this aspect of the rule, especiallyinsofar as this approach could override local residency preferences. Asnoted in the comment summary above, many PHAs view local residency preferencesas an essential part of their programs_even as an implicit ``contract''under which local communities agree to cooperate in the development ofassisted housing in return for the assurance that their needy residentswill be served first. In contrast, few owners under the rule's other programs commented on, orobjected to, the ``primacy of the preferences.'' Owners in these programstypically do not use local tenant selection preferences, including residencypreferences, and, thus, do not have nearly the intense interest in thisissue that PHAs do. Second, PHAs and IHAs have traditionally been given a great deal of discretionin the administration of their local public housing programs. Indeed, oneof the major policies of the 1937 Act is ``to vest in local public housingagencies the maximum amount of responsibility in the administration oftheir housing programs * * * '' Section 2 of the 1937 Act. Moreover, PHAsand IHAs are public bodies created by State, local, and tribal governments,and traditionally have jurisdiction over a broad area. Giving these entitiesgreater responsibility for administering the preferences serves the goalof minimizing Federal control over matters of local concern that are withinthe competency of local governments. By contrast, for most purposes, theowners of projects under the other programs are not likely to receive guidancein the management of projects from non-mortgagee agencies of State or localgovernments. In addition, the final rule continues the approach taken in the proposedrule of treating PHAs that administer Section 8 projects in the same wayas other Section 8 owners. PHAs administering Section 8 projects have traditionallybeen viewed as project owners. Thus, they are commonly required to fulfilldifferent regulatory requirements for the public housing and Section 8programs. For example, Section 8 projects are not subject to a cooperationagreement requirement under section 5(e)(2) of the 1937 Act, are not exemptfrom State and local real and personal taxes under section 6(d) of theAct, are not eligible for operating subsidies under section 9 or for comprehensiveimprovement assistance under section 14 of the Act, and are not subjectto requirements governing the demolition and disposition of housing undersection 18 of the Act. Additionally, PHA public housing lease and grievanceprocedures under 24 CFR Part 966 differ from the termination of tenancyprovisions under 24 CFR Chapter VIII that govern FHA-insured Section 8projects. For these reasons, the Department has determined that the 10 percent exceptionapproach should only be extended to PHAs, and only the PHAs operating Publicand Indian Housing programs and Certificate and Moderate Rehabilitationprograms. We believe that this approach adequately responds to the commenters'concern that PHAs be given flexibility to tailor the Federal preferencesto locally defined needs and requirements. The 10 percent ``safety valve''provides PHAs with significant discretion to fashion their own tenant selectionsystems, while ensuring achievement of the statutory objective of directinghousing assistance to those with the greatest need. Finally, it should be noted that the position of the Federal statutorypreferences under the rule vis-a-vis locally derived preferences may worka limited preemption of local preferences_including those that may havebeen established by State or local law. The Department believes that thisresult is a necessary concommitant of the statutory directive and is clearlyappropriate under preemption doctrine pronounced by the U.S. Supreme Courtin <T3>Hillsborough County, Florida v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</T3>471 U.S. 707 (1985). As the Court stated in that case at 713:``Even where Congress has not completed displaced state regulation in aspecific area, state law is nullified to the extent that it actually conflictswith federal law. Such a conflict arises when compliance with both federaland state regulations is a physical impossibility,'' <T3>Florida Lime andamp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </T3>373 U.S. 132,142-143 (1963), or when state law ``stands as an obstacle to the accomplishmentand execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,'' <T3>Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </T3>at 67.It is clear that in certain circumstances the Federal preferences may conflictwith preferences established by State or local law. For example, the rulemay require that assistance be provided to an applicant who holds onlya Federal preference before another applicant who does not qualify fora Federal preference, but who holds a veterans' preference created by Statelaw. Since only one candidate can ``go first,'' the two requirements conflict;in the words of the Court, ``compliance with both federal and state regulationsis a physical impossibility,'' and ``the state law `stands as an obstacleto the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectivesof the Congress * * *' ''. In such a situation, the State law must yieldto the Federal imperative. It should be noted, however, that this conclusion does not mean that preferencescreated by State and local law are wholly preempted, and have no placein the talent selection process. Owners and PHAs may continue to use thesepreferences in their selection policies. Thus, PHAs and owners may usethese preferences to rank Federal preference-holders, as well as to rankapplicants who do not qualify for Federal preference. In addition, PHAsthat qualify for the 10 percent exception discussed earlier, may favorapplicants with State or local preferences over those with Federal preferences,consistent with the standards for using the 10 percent exception and applicableFHEO requirements. Where, however, the State or local preference conflictswith the Federal preferences, the State or local law must yield to theFederal statute implemented by today's final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. </ITAG>Use of Local Preferences to Select Among Federal Preference-HoldersAs noted earlier, the proposed rule provided no role for local preferencesto distinguish among applicants that held a Federal preference; the onlyissue was whether an applicant qualified for a Federal preference and,if so, he or she received consideration for assistance based solely onthe <T3>Federal </T3>preference, irrespective of the number or type of <T3>local </T3>preferences that the applicant might hold. The final rulealters this rigid approach by permitting PHAs and owners in all of theprograms subject to this rule to use State or local preferences as a meansof selecting among Federal preference holders. For example, a PHA or ownercould provide that an applicant who was living in substandard housing andhad a local residence preference would receive assistance before anotherwho only held a substandard housing preference. Another example of a localpreference that a PHA or owner may use to distinquish among Federal preference-holdersis a preference to select qualified candidates for a State or local programto move low-income families from welfare to employment and economic andsocial self-sufficiency. In addition, according weights could reflect local concerns associatedwith ongoing housing assistance activity. For example, a PHA could providethat those paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent becausetheir living units had increased in cost after Rental Rehabilitation activityshould take precedence over those paying 50 percent of family income forrent where other factors account for the high rent burden. It should be noted that this approach is distinct from the 10 percent exceptiondiscussed in the previous section. The 10 percent feature permits PHAsto admit to assistance some families that have no Federal preference overthose that do. The discretion accorded here enables PHAs and owners touse local preferences as a means of rank-ordering among those applicantsthat do have preference and, those without a Federal preference can receiveassistance before those with such a preference. The Department believesthat the ability to use local preferences in this way will augment thelatitude given PHAs under the 10 percent exception features. It will alsogive other owners needed flexibility in administering their programs. This approach also responds to commenters' concerns that PHAs and ownershave the greatest possible flexibility to tailor housing assistance tomeet local needs, and to commenters' fears that the rule would force themto accept non-resident Federal preference-holders before residents. Asnoted above, PHAs and owners may use local residency preferences as a wayof ranking Federal preference-holders. Thus, at least among federally preferredapplicants and to the extent such preferences do not conflict with applicablefair housing and equal opportunity requirements, PHAs and owners couldensure that local residents come first. It is at least theoretically possible that a non-resident Federal preference-holdercould take precedence over a resident, if no resident applicant held aFederal preference and, in the case of certain PHA programs, the 10 percentexception was unavailable. Although the Department has no data upon whichto estimate the incidence of this situation, we do not expect it to occurwith any frequency, especially for PHAs and owners that have sizable waitinglists. In any event, however, the Department believes that if the Federalpreferences operate to furnish assistance to a non-resident Federal preference-holderbefore a resident without a Federal preference, this is a necessary concommitmentto implementing the statutory mandate. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Aggregating and Ranking the Federal Preferences </ITAG>As noted before, the proposed rule did not permit the Federal preferencesto be aggregated or ranked. (See 49 FR 37789.) Thus, with respect to aggregation,a prospective tenant who qualified for two or more of the preferences couldnot take precedence over another who qualified for only one. With respectto ranking, qualification for a preference could be based on any permissibleground, and once obtained, each preference was coequal with the others:<T3>i.e., </T3>determinations of the relative weight to be accorded thepreferences or their bases for qualification (or both) were not permitted.Commenters opposed this policy on grounds that it provided no means ofdetermining who has the greatest need for housing assistance_a problemthat is exacerbated if, as some commenters argued, qualification for atleast one of the preferences would be nearly universal. The Departmenthas reviewed the position taken in the proposed rule, and has decided topermit PHAs and project owners to rank the preferences or their components(or both), and to aggregate the preferences according to the PHA's or owner'sdetermination of the relative need for housing that the preferences represent.For example, <T3>with respect to aggregating the preferences, </T3>a PHA or owner maydecide that a family that is paying more than 50 percent of its incometo rent a substandard unit has a greater need for housing than one thatis paying more than 50 percent of its income for a standard unit, and provideassistance to the former family before the latter. <T3>With respect to ranking the preferences, </T3>a PHA or owner may providethat those living in substandard housing have a greater need for housingthan those paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent and, therefore,may accord the former preference greater weight in the selection processthan the latter preference. <T3>With respect to ranking the preferences' definitional elements, </T3>aPHA or owner may provide that those living in housing that is dilapidatedor that has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit ofgovernment have a greater need for housing than those whose housing issubstandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub or shower insidethe unit for the exclusive use of the family and, therefore, may accordthe former circumstance greater weight in the selection process than thelatter circumstance. Similarly, a PHA or owner may provide that those livingin dilapidated housing or housing that has been declared unfit for habitationby an agency or unit of government have a greater need for housing thanthose paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent, but that thosepaying more than 50 percent of income for rent have a greater need forhousing than those whose housing is substandard only because it does nothave a usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use ofthe family. In this case, PHAs and owners could accord appropriate weightsreflecting these determinations of need. Since PHAs and owners will meet the statutory requirement that preferencebe given the three categories of applicants, irrespective of the aggregationor ranking of the preferences chosen, the rule does not impose specificlimits on PHA or owner discretion to rank or cumulate the Federal preferences.Paragraph (b) of today's rule contains these provisions.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>This preamble makes a number of references to amendmentsto specific ``paragraphs'' of today's rule. Since this proceeding amendsseveral Parts of 24 CFR, but uses essentially the same paragraph designationsfor each Part amended, this terminology means that the paragraph referredto has been amended in each Part covered by this rule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">D. Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Considerations </ITAG>Today's rule contains language in paragraph (b) to ensure that the Federalpreferences and any non-Federal preferences and priorities are establishedand administered in a manner that (1) is consistent with HUD's affirmativefair housing marketing policies (see 24 CFR 200.610) and (if applicable)the owner's HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, and (2)is not incompatible with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000d; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3601-19; ExecutiveOrder 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing, 27 FR 11527 (1962), <T3>as amended </T3>at 46 FR 1253 (1980); Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101-07; or HUD's regulations and requirements issued under these authorities.These provisions are designed to ensure that the mandates of Title VIIIof the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,and related civil rights authorities are met. (Part 905 of the rule containsmodifications appropriate to the special status of Indians under civilrights laws.) <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Advance HUD Approval of Federal Preference Systems </ITAG>The final rule imposes no new requirements for advance HUD approval ofowner or PHA preference systems. These systems, however, are subject toexisting approval requirements, such as the requirement in the Section8 Certificate and Moderate Rehabilitation programs that tenant selectionpreferences be incorporated into the PHA's Administrative Plan. For other programs covered by the rule, owners and PHAs must send HUD acopy of any preference system that proposes to use a local residency preference.This submission requirement does not affect the ability of the owner orPHA to implement the Federal preferences, but reflects the Department'sconcern that residency preferences be administered in accordance with HUD'sfair housing and equal opportunity requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Relationship to Other Federal Authorities </ITAG>Several commenters requested guidance on the relationship between the threepreferences and existing Federal preferences or requirements. Specificguidance was requested on the following: _The requirement that PHAs select families eligible for assistance underthe Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program that reside in units designatedfor rehabilitation, without requiring that they be placed on a waitinglist. (24 CFR 882.514(b)) _The provision permitting PHAs to give a preference for admission to IndependentGroup Residences to families that express an interest in residing in sucha Residence. (24 CFR 882.209(a)(6))   Preliminarily, it should be noted that the ``primacy of the preferences''concept in the proposed rule involved only the relationship between thethree Federal preferences and <T3>locally created </T3>(or non-Federal) preferences. The rule itselfdid not speak to the relationship between the three preferences and other<T3>Federal </T3>preferences or requirements. The preamble, however, containedthe following guidance:<ITAG tagnum="21">The rule would not preempt those classes of tenants accorded specifiedpreferential treatment under other Federal regulatory or statutory authorities.For example, sections 221(f) and 231(f) of the National Housing Act (NHA),12 U.S.C. 1715<T3>l</T3>(f), and 1715v(f), respectively, authorize the Secretary to adoptprocedures to assure that housing provided under these sections ``is availableto displaced families'' (section 221(f)) or to prescribe procedures tosecure for handicapped families ``preference or priority of opportunityto rent the living units specially designed for their use and occupancy''(section 231(f)). These statutory requirements are implemented by regulatoryprovisions at 24 CFR 221.537(c), giving a preference to displacees, andat 24 CFR 231.9, giving a preference to elderly or handicapped persons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The statutory language is unambiguous that these [the Federal] preferencesmust be given to eligible applicants, but these preferences are not intendedto be applied so as to vitiate other regulatory and statutory objectives.For example, 24 CFR 860.204(c) [now andSection; 960.204(c)] makes it clearthat tenant selection policies shall be in compliance with, among otherthings, ``the nondiscrimination requirements of Title VI of the Civil RightsAct of 1964.'' Owners and PHAs are, thus, under a continuing obligationto observe all pertinent Federal regulatory and statutory requirementswhile giving the preferences to eligible applicants. See also 24 CFR 880.603(d),881.603(b) and 883.704(b). (49 FR 37789)</ITAG>The Department believes that this approach is correct, and has amendedthe proposed rule to make this relationship clearer, by requiring thatthe three Federal preferences be implemented in a manner that is ``consistentwith'' other applicable Federal requirements. (See paragraph (b) of today'srule.) Because of the variety and complexity of the situations in whichthe three preferences may interact with other Federal preferences and requirements,and the confusion expressed by the commenters on this point, the Departmentbelieves that detailed discussion and guidance on how these authoritiesinterrelate is appropriate.In the Department view, the basic precept is that the three preferencesand other Federal authorities should be read in a way that fully implementseach provision to the maximum extent possible. Situations may occur, however,in which there is conflict between the preferences and the other authority:<T3>viz.</T3>: where one provision can be given effect only at the sacrificeof the other. The following guidance is intended primarily to address thesesituations.1. <T3>Preferences and Requirements in Federal Statutes_</T3>(a) <T3>Broad Range of Incomes. </T3>Section 6(c)(4)(A) of the 1937 Act requiresPHAs administering public housing programs to establish tenant selectioncriteria that both contain the three preferences and are designed ``toassure that, within a reasonable period of time, the project will includefamilies with a broad range of incomes * * *.'' This provision presentsspecial issues, since the two requirements are coequal elements of thesame subparagraph. The Department believes that PHAs are under an obligationto try to satisfy both requirements to the fullest extent possible. Forexample, each requirement can be met by applying the preferences to theincome groups involved. Thus, if a higher income family is needed to satisfythe ``broad range of incomes'' requirement, a higher income family thatqualifies for a preference would be chosen first; if a poorer family isthe next to be chosen, a poorer family with a preference would be selectedfirst. Similarly, PHAs may use the ``broad range of incomes'' requirementas a type of ``local preference,'' by ranking Federal preference-holdersaccording to the income categories involved.Problems may arise, however, in situations where both the preferences andthe ``broad range of incomes'' requirements cannot be satisfied, as forexample, where the ``broad range of incomes'' policy requires a higherincome family, but only poorer families hold a preference. In this situation,PHAs could satisfy the ``broad range of incomes'' requirement by usingthe 10 percent exception authority to admit to tenancy the non-preferredcandidate ahead of the federally preferred applicant: in the example, thenon-preferred higher income applicant before the preferred lower incomeapplicant.If, however, the 10 percent authority is not available, the Departmentbelieves that the preferences generally take precedence. In the example,the poorer family with the preference must be considered for assistancebefore the non-preferred, higher income applicant.The Department believes that this conclusion is amply supported by thestatute and its legislative history. As noted above, the preference portionof section 6(c)(4)(A) is categorical in its mandate: the PHA's tenant selectioncriteria ``shall give preference.'' The legislative history referred toearlier is equally categorical. On the other hand, the portion of the statutedealing with range of incomes is far less categorical. Thus, the statuterequires that the PHAs actions be designed to achieve the ``broad rangeof incomes within a reasonable period of time.'' In implementing this authority,andSection; 960.205(c) and (c)(8) require PHAs to establish selection criteriathat (1) are ``reasonably related to achieving the basic objective'' and(2) ``by preference or otherwise'' will be ``reasonably calculated to obtainthe basic objective.''Since the preference language is expressed in far more direct and immediateterms, the Department believes that the preferences take precedence overthe ``broad range of incomes'' requirement, where both of the requirementscannot be satisfied in a given instance.(b) <T3>Other Statutory Requirements. </T3>Examples of other statutory provisionsthat contain preference and other requirements include the following NationalHousing Act authorities: section 221(f) (preference for displaced families_defines``displaced families'' more narrowly than ``involuntary displacement''under the final rule); sections 231(a)(1) and (f) (not less than 50 percentof insured units must be specially designed for the use and occupancy ofelderly persons, and preference for handicapped persons, respectively);section 250(c)(2) (priority for prospective section 8 tenants with thelowest income, where section 8 assistance is provided to forestall prepaymentof insured, subsidized project mortgages); and section 207(b)(2) (prohibitionof discrimination against families with children). Section 3(b)(3) of the1937 Act gives preference in admission to assisted housing to elderly,handicapped, or displaced single persons before other single persons whoare not in one of those categories.Consistent with the basic precept described above, the three preferencesand these provisions should be implemented so as to achieve the objectivesof both the preferences and these authorities. For example, among applicantsfor Section 8 units in section 231 projects who qualify for one of thethree preferences, elderly or handicapped applicants would be taken first.Where a conflict arises_such as if no elderly or handicapped applicantsin the example hold a preference_<T3>the program-specific requirement would prevail. </T3>Thus, in the example,elderly or handicapped applicants without a preference would take precedenceover other applicants with a preference. The rationale for this resultis that where Congress has provided competing authorities, the more specificshould take precedence. In the example, the section 231 preference prevails,since that preference inheres in the nature of the project itself, whereasthe three preferences apply to Section 8 assistance generally.2. <T3>Preferences and Requirements in Regulatory Authorities_</T3>(a) <T3>No Apparent Conflict. </T3>There are a number of regulatory authoritiesthat provide for preferences or impose other requirements that can clearlybe given full effect together with the three preferences. These authoritiesinclude:_Fair housing and equal opportunity requirements, such as those containedin andSection;andSection; 880.210, 882.111, and 960.203; and_andSection; 882.209(a)(6), which allows a PHA to establish a preferencefor selecting an eligible applicant who has indicated a desire to residein an Independent Group Residence, when a current Section 8 participantin an IGR moves.Fair housing and equal opportunity requirements apply to the selectionof all applicants for assisted housing, irrespective of whether they holda Federal preference. Thus, these requirements do not conflict with thepreferences.In the Part 882 example, PHAs can satisfy the Federal preferences by offeringCertificates first to those who are Federal preference-holders. The factthat no preference-holders wish to take advantage of these opportunities,or that there may not be a family on the waiting list that qualifies fora Federal preference, does not create a conflict under these regulatoryprovisions: the PHA has discharged its responsibilities by making the Certificatesfirst available to Federal preference-holders on the waiting list.(b) <T3>Apparent conflict. </T3>There are, however, several regulatory authoritiesthat have the potential for conflict with the Federal preferences. Forexample, andSection; 882.514(b) requires PHAs to select eligible familiesliving in a project to be rehabilitated under the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitationprogram ``without requiring that these Families be placed on a waitinglist.'' Subparts A (Loan Management) and C (Property Disposition) of Part886 provide Section 8 assistance to otherwise eligible tenants who areoccupying assisted projects when the Section 8 contract is executed. Section882.209(a)(4)(ii)(B) provides for Certificates for eligible families livingin:(i) HUD-owned multifamily projects, when HUD decides to sell the projector to vacate units in the project;(ii) HUD-held multifamily projects, when HUD forecloses, and a party otherthan HUD acquires the project at foreclosure; and(iii) Section 8-assisted projects, in which the owner elects not to renewa Section 8 contract.Each of these authorities can have the effect of targetting Section 8 Certificatesto those who are eligible for Section 8 assistance, but who do not qualifyfor any of the Federal preferences. The Department has concluded, however,that the preference requirements should not be implemented in a way thatvitiates these special Section 8 authorities.<T3>Moderate Rehabilitation.</T3> The purpose of the Section 8 ModerateRehabilitation program is ``upgrading and thereby preserving the Nation'shousing stock.'' (Section 8(e)(2) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437f(e)(2)).The subsidy involves a 15-year Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP)contract that is attached to the structure. The Department does not believethat Congress intended that the program and the Federal preferences interactin a way that could result in the displacement of Section 8-eligible familiesfrom Moderate Rehabilitation projects, only to fill the vacancies createdwith other Section 8-eligible families.In addition, in HUD's appropriation Acts, the Congress routinely approvesthe use of Section 8 authority for Moderate Rehabilitation. See, for example,the table of gross reservations for fiscal years 1984 and 1985 (H.R. Rep.No. 867, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 9, 11 (1984)), fiscal year 1986 (H.R. Rep.No. 363, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1985)), and fiscal year 1987 (H.R. Rep.No. 977, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986)). The Department believes that thisCongressional approval indicates clear Congressional intent that the ModerateRehabilitation program continue, despite the fact that some of the tenantsinitially receiving Section 8 assistance may not qualify for a Federalpreference. Thus, it is permissible to direct Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitationassistance to existing occupants who qualify under the program.<T3>Loan Management/Property Disposition.</T3> The primary purpose of Part886, Subpart A (Loan Management), is to reduce claims on the Department'sinsurance fund by aiding those FHA-insured or HUD-held projects with immediatelyor potentially serious financial difficulties. (andSection; 886.101(c)).The purposes of Part 886, Subpart C (Property Disposition), are to increaseand maintain the amount of decent, safe, and sanitary housing affordableby lower income families; minimize displacement of tenants; preserve andrevitalize residential neighborhoods; and dispose of projects in a mannerconsistent with HUD's disposition objectives. (andSection; 886.301.) Thesubsidy involves five- and 15-year, respectively, Section 8 HAP contractsthat are attached to the structure.As in the case of Moderate Rehabilitation, Congress regularly approvesthe use of Section 8 authority for Loan Management and Property Disposition.See, for example, the tables of gross reservations referred to above forfiscal years 1984 and 1985, fiscal year 1986, and fiscal year 1987. TheDepartment believes that this legislative history provides adequate sanctionfor the use of Loan Management and Property Disposition authority for tenantsin place when the Section 8 contract is executed, without regard to whetherthey qualify for a Federal preference at that time. In addition, to theextent that rents for these tenants were subsidized before their receiptof Section 8 assistance, they would not be considered to be ``seeking assistance''as contemplated by the preference statute, but rather to be transferringdirectly from one form of rental subsidy to another_an event that the Departmentbelieves is outside the purview of the preference authority.<T3>HUD-owned/Held Multifamily Projects.</T3> Sections 882.209(a)(4)(B)(<T3>2</T3>) and (<T3>3</T3>) require that if HUD makes Section 8 Certificates availableto a PHA for use in connection with (1) a HUD-owned multifamily projectthat HUD decides to sell or in which HUD wishes to vacate units, or (2)a HUD-held multifamily project that is acquired at foreclosure by a partyother than HUD, and PHA must use them for these purposes. These uses ofCertificates provide an alternative to the project-based subsidy approachfor supporting HUD's Property Disposition program that is contemplatedby Part 886, Subpart C.Since these Certificates are funded from authority made available for PropertyDisposition, the same considerations mentioned above with respect to Congressionalapproval in appropriation Acts pertain to their use. In addition, as notedabove, provision of Section 8 assistance to a tenant whose rent was subsidizedbefore receipt of a Certificate is not subject to the preference provision.<T3>Section 8 ``Opt-outs.''</T3> Certain project-based Section 8 contractsprovide for an initial term not to exceed five years, and are renewableat the sole option of the owner for additional terms of up to five years,not to exceed a specified period. (See 24 CFR 880.109 (1979) and 24 CFRPart 1273, App. II (1975).) The regulatory scheme under andSection; 882.209(a)(4)(B)(<T3>4</T3>) calls for PHAs to make Section 8 assistance available for eligiblefamilies residing in projects when the owner elects not to renew the contractfor an additional term. Since provision of Section 8 assistance in thesecircumstances simply substitutes one form of rental assistance for another,the preference provisions are, as noted above, inapplicable.<T3>Demolition/Disposition of Public Housing.</T3> Congress has regularlyapproved HUD's request to make Section 8 Housing Vouchers available totenants of public and Indian projects that are to be demolished or disposedof. See, for example, the tables of gross reservations referred to abovefor fiscal years 1986 and 1987. Since receipt of a Voucher in these circumstancessimply substitutes one form of assistance for another, the preference provisionsare inapplicable.3.<T3> FHandamp;EO Administrative and Judicial Remedies.</T3> Where HUD makesa finding of discrimination in accordance with procedures under applicablecivil rights law, and imposes a race-conscious remedy, imposition of theremedy takes precedence over the Federal preferences. That is, if the remedycalls for the next tenant to be a minority family and no minority familiesqualify for a preference, a non-preferred minority family would be selectedfor the unit over a non-minority family with a preference. Similarly, court-decreedcivil rights remedies take precedence over the preferences. These typesof remedies are necessary to redress specific instances of discrimination,and the Department does not believe the Congress intended the preferencesto override them.II. Discretion Accorded PHAsThe proposed rule permitted PHAs (including IHAs) operating public andIndian housing programs, and the Section 8 Existing and Moderate Rehabilitationprograms under Part 882, to develop their own definitions for the threepreferred categories (subject to HUD approval), and to devise their ownverification procedures. (See the proposed rule's amendments to 24 CFRParts 904 and 905 and andSection;andSection; 882.209a(a), 882.514a(a), and960.204a(a).) That rule required owners under all other programs (includingPHAs and IHAs, where they own projects under those programs) to adopt thedefinitions and verification procedures prescribed in the rule. A commenterobjected to this bifurcated approach on grounds that since applicants mayapply for assistance under several of the programs covered by this rulemaking,it will be confusing to an applicant who has applied for assistance underboth ``PHA'' and ``owner'' programs to find his or her eligibility notbeing defined or determined (or both) in a uniform manner.As noted earlier, this bifurcated approach is amply justified by the statutoryand programmatic differences between ``PHA programs'' and ``project ownerprograms.'' In addition, the Department believes that any confusion thatmay be occasioned by this approach can be minimized by providing necessaryinformation and instructions to prospective tenants_as required in paragraph(a) of the rule. Accordingly, the Department has retained the bifurcatedapproach in today's rule.III. Definitions of the Federal PreferencesThe definitions of the preferences used in the proposed rule elicited numerouscomments and requests for clarification. The following summarizes the publiccomments, and gives HUD's responses, for each of the preference categories.Before discussing this material, the Department wishes to emphasize twogeneral points. First, the Department has attempted to draft the rule'sdifinitions broadly enough to ensure that those with the most urgent housingneeds will be covered, yet narrowly enough that qualification for the preferenceswill not be so widespread as to dilute their effect. Second, as discussedabove, the final rules governing the Public and Indian Housing programs(24 CFR Parts 904, 905, and 960), and the Section 8 Certificate and ModerateRehabilitation programs (24 CFR Part 882, Subparts A and B, D and E, andF), differ from the rules for the other programs in serveral respects,including PHA (and IHA) discretion (subject to HUD approval) to developtheir own definitions of the preferred categories. HUD's disposition ofthe public comments in based solely upon the definitions contained in theproposed rule, and does not address alternative definitions that PHAs orIHAs may propose.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. </ITAG><T3>Involuntary Displacement</T3>One commenter asked whether a family that is evicted for non-payment ofrent would be considered ``involuntarily displaced,'' if the failure topay the rent resulted from the loss of employment of a family member. Sinceparagraphs (d)(3) (A) and (B) of the proposed rule required the owner'saction causing the displacement to be ``beyond an applicant's ability tocontrol or prevent'' and to occur ``despite an applicant's having met allpreviously imposed conditions of occupancy,'' respectively, the proposedrule did not consider a tenant displaced by eviction_irrespective of thereason_as ``involuntarily displaced.'' The Department limited the definitionin this manner to avoid imposing the further burden of PHAs and ownersof having to determine why an applicant was evicted. The Department continuesto believe that it is inappropriate to require PHAs and owners to assumethis additional burden, and no change is made in this rule in this respect.It should be noted, however, that a family suffering a loss of income dueto the unemployment of a wage earner may qualify for one or both of theother two preferences.Paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provided that an applicant wouldqualify for the preference if ``the applicant has been involuntarily displacedand is not living in standard replacement housing.'' Paragraph (c)(5) defined``standard replacement housing'' as, among other things, ``adequate forthe family size.'' One commenter asked what is to be considered ``adequatefor family size.'' Given the greater discretion accorded them under therule, PHAs have discretion to fashion their own definition for the Publicand Indian Housing programs, and for the Section 8 Certificate and ModerateRehabilitation programs; the Department expects PHAs and project ownersin the other programs to use the applicable occupancy standards containedin HUD Handbooks. Accordingly, the final rule does not contain a definitionof this phrase.Several commenters objected to the provision in paragraph (d) of the proposedrule that excluded from the definition of ``involuntary displacement''a landlord's decision not to renew a lease or occupancy agreement. Theyargued that a tenant whose tenancy is terminated against his or her willis just as ``involuntarily displaced'' as tenants who are displaced becauseof other owner actions that meet the proposed rule's definition. They alsoargued that since landlords can use ``laspe of time evictions'' to terminatetenancy in lieu of giving notice of other owner actions that qualify underthe definition, excluding such ``evictions'' from the definition coulddeprive tenants of the documentation necessary to qualify for a preference.The Department agrees with these commenters, and has removed that limitationfrom the final rule. The Department notes, however, in response to othercomments, that recognizing an owner's decision not to renew a lease asa possible ground for ``involuntary displacement'' would not lead to preferentialtreatment of ``undesirable'' tenants whose landlords opted to let theirleases expire rather than pursue an eviction. Project owners and PHAs administeringPublic and Indian Housing projects remain obliged to determine whetherprospective tenants' habits or practices make them unsuitable for tenancyin assisted projects; this rule in no way affects that responsibility.One commenter thought it ``unfair that a deserving family'' would not geta preference on the basis that it was involuntarily displaced, if it wasinvoluntarily displaced at one time, but it is living in standard replacementhousing when its qualification for a preference is verified. The proposedrule excluded such a family because, as the comment itself states, thefamily is living in <T3>standard</T3> housing, and (assuming that the family is not payingmore than 50 percent of its income for rent) no longer has the urgent needfor housing assistance that the preferences are designed to address. Stateddifferently, the family has achieved the very state_occupancy of standardhousing_that the granting of a preference would have helped them achieve.The final rule is unchanged on that point.One commenter suggested that the preference for involuntary displacementshould be limited to 30 days on either side of the displacing event. TheDepartment does not agree with this suggestion. Paragraph (c)(1)(i) ofthe proposed rule conferred the involuntary displacement preference ifthe applicant had been involuntarily displaced and was not living in standard,replacement housing, or would have been involuntarily displaced withinsix months of certification or verification as to qualification for thepreference. The Department does not believe that it makes sense to imposea time period after the displacement occurs: the only relevant inquiryat that point is whether the applicant is living in standard, replacementhousing. Imposition of a 30-day limit for prospective displacements istoo short a period, and would disqualify too many applicants that the statute_ifgiven any reasonable interpretation_was intended to reach. Indeed, theintake process for housing assistance applications may itself take morethan the 30 days suggested.The Department rejects the comment that the preference for substandardhousing and involuntarily displaced families should be limited to situationswhere a family's property is condemned_and then only if the condemned propertycomplied with the applicable code when the applicant claiming a preferencefirst occupied it. The Department believes that the standard suggestedis far too narrow, and would inappropriately exclude many of the situationsthat a fair reading of the term ``involuntary displacement'' and Congressionalintent would cover. In addition, limiting the preference to situationsin which the property met code standards at initial occupancy would imposea unnecessary (and frequently impossible) administrative burden on prospectivetenants, as well as on PHAs and owners.One commenter recommended that where modernization of a project resultsin affected tenants being temporarily relocated, the tenants should begiven an additional priority on the waiting list. Such tenants, insofaras this rule is concerned, would not be considered involuntarily displaced.They would not be ``applicants for housing'' to which the preferences apply,but tenants holding the right to reoccupy their units after rehabilitation,without any reference to a waiting list.A commenter suggested that only government agencies whose functions involvepublic improvement and development should be authorized to verify thata family has been involuntarily displaced. This commenter argued that permittingverification of involuntary displacement on the basis of previous landlords'representations would encourage landlords to lie in order to use the availabilityof the preferences as a way of getting rid of ``problem tenants.''This suggestion is impracticable, in the Department's view, because somejurisdictions may not have such agencies, or if they do, the agencies maynot have the competency or resources to furnish the verification required.The Department believes that the proposed rule's approach of also permittingthe previous landlord or agent to provide written notice of a prospectivetenant's reason for displacement strikes an appropriate balance betweenprotecting project owners and PHAs from ``problem tenants'' and ensuringtenants' access to reasonable means of verifying their qualification fora preference.The Department does not believe, as a commenter argued, that private actionis too broad and vague to serve as a ground for according a preference,or that verification of private action is excessively difficult. The Departmenthas reviewed the legislative history surrounding enactment of the ``involuntarydisplacement'' basis for awarding a preference, and can find nothing tosuggest that the term should be limited to displacement caused by governmentalaction. On the contrary, the solicitude in the legislative history thathousing assistance be directed to those with the most urgent housing needsargues strongly for including both public and private displacement, sinceone's status of having been ``involuntarily displaced'' and need for housingturn on the <T3>fact</T3> of displacement, not the <T3>nature</T3> of the displacing action. In addition, HUD believes thatthe type of private action that is cognizable under the rule is clearlydelineated and circumscribed, and that verification would generally beno more difficult than would be required for public action.Paragraph (d) of the proposed rule contained an illustrative listing ofoccurrences that may constitute ``involuntary displacement.'' Most of theexamples on the list dealt with the project owner's withdrawal of the structureor the family's unit from the rental market. One commenter recommendedthat this listing be deleted, because (in the commenter's view) it producesconfusion and implies a narrower construction than the rest of the definitionrequires. The Department notes that the listing is only illustrative andis not intended (nor would it have the effect) of narrowing the types ofdisplacements that may be cognizable under paragraph (d)(3). The finalrule is unchanged on that point.The final rule adds a provision including the victims of domestic violenceamong those who may qualify for a preference on grounds of involuntarydisplacement. (See paragraph (d)(2) of the rule.) The Department believesthat according a preference for the victims of domestic violence recognizestheir pressing need for a safe home environment for themselves and theirfamilies, and is entirely consonant with the preferences' objective ofdirecting housing assistance to those with the greatest housing needs.Specifically, an applicant for housing assistance would be considered involuntarilydisplaced if the applicant leaves his or her dwelling as a result of actualor threatened physical violence directed against the applicant or a memberof the applicant's family by his or her spouse or other member of the applicant'shousehold. The Department does not believe that actual violence againstthe applicant should be a condition precedent to qualifying for the preference:the threat of violence against the applicant, or actual or threatened violenceagainst the applicant's family, has the same effect of destroying the peacefulenjoyment of the family abode.The final rule also considers as involuntarily displaced an applicant wholives in a unit with a spouse or other member of the applicant's householdwho engages in this type of violence. The Department does not believe thatan applicant should be forced physically to vacate the unit before qualifyingfor the preference. Such a position would be wholly insensitive to thedifficult and complex situation in which the victims of domestic violenceoften find themselves, and may result in additional, unnecessary physicaland emotional damage to the applicant and his or her family.The final rule amends paragraph (e) of the proposed rule to specify thata domestic violence situation is to be verified through written confirmationfrom the local police department, social services agency, or court of competentjurisdiction, or a clergyman, physician, or public or private facilitythat provides shelter or counseling to the victims of domestic violence.Although the final rule generally focuses on verification by objectivearms of government to reduce the administrative burdens on PHAs and owners,the Department believes that reference to clergymen, physicians, and privateoperators of facilities for victims of domestic violence is appropriate,since many genuine instances of domestic violence may only be shared withprivate counselors and doctors, and may never come to the attention ofgovernment authorities. The final rule also provides that the instancesof violence must be recent or of a continuing nature. This requirementis designed to ensure that a preference claim is based upon a current domesticviolence condition. Paragraph (c)(5) of the rule contains a conformingchange to make clear that in the domestic violence situation, ``standard,replacement housing'' does not include the dwelling shared by the victimand the assailant, or temporary shelters for the victims of domestic violence.The Department wishes to emphasize that identification of victims of domesticviolence (and, as noted later, ``homeless families'') among the types ofapplicants covered by the statutory preferences does not abrogate the responsibilityof the PHA or owner to assure, on a case-by-case basis, that all potentialtenants are able and willing to live up to the obligation imposed by thedwelling lease. In addition, the fact that these classes of individualsmay have preferred status does not allow PHAs and owners to divert housingresources to purposes not contemplated by the statute, such as leasingassisted housing to entities other than income-eligible families, or forthe purpose of providing transient housing facilities or temporary shelter.The final rule also amends paragraph (c)(5) of the proposed rule to requirethat ``standard, replacement housing'' be ``permanent'' and occupied pursuantto a lease or occupancy agreement. This is a technical change to make clearthat the type of replacement housing that can divest an applicant of theinvoluntary displacement preference must not be temporary in nature.Paragraph (d)(2) of the proposed rule has been revised to add code enforcementas a potential public displacement action. This is a minor change to makeclear that public displacement actions can include code enforcement actionsthat are not part of a public improvement or development program. (Seeparagraph (d)(1)(ii).)Finally, the final rule amends paragraph (d)(3) to specify that an applicantwho vacates a unit as a result of actions taken because of his or her refusalto comply with the applicable program occupancy policies and procedureswith respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowded units isnot to be considered ``involuntarily displaced.'' (For examples of regulationscontaining these policies and procedures, see andSection;andSection; 215.65,880.605, 881.605, 882.213, 882.509, 883.706, 884.219, 886.125, and 886.325.)This is a minor amendment designed to prevent an applicant who refusesto follow HUD's requirements for ensuring that assisted tenants are notoverhoused from benefiting from the noncompliance, by attempting to establishqualification for a preference after any resulting displacement.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Substandard Housing</ITAG>A commenter suggested that, to avoid PHA inspection of units, a ``substandard''unit should be defined as one that does not meet the Section 8 HousingQuality Standards (HQS). The rule does not require PHAs or project ownersto inspect applicants' units. Paragraph (g) of the proposed rule providedthat verification of substandard housing would consist of a written statementor notice from a local government agency or from the applicant's presentlandlord as to the unit's condition. Since, as noted above, PHAs in someprograms would have discretion to develop and use their own verificationprocedures, they may <T3>elect </T3>to inspect the unit involved as part of these procedures,but the rule does not <T3>require </T3>them to do so.In addition, the Department does not believe that PHAs and project ownersshould have to use the Section 8 HQS to determine whether a housing unitis substandard. The HQS are designed to set minimum standards for determiningwhether a unit is eligible for Section 8 assistance, and are more prescriptivethan the definition of ``substandard housing'' contained in paragraph (g).While the HQS are appropriate for determining minimum standards for federallyassisted housing, the Department believes that the purpose of the Federalpreferences_to target housing assistance to those with the greatest housingneed_is better served by the approach taken in the proposed rule, of generallyfocusing the definition of substandardness on more serious indicators ofinadequate housing quality. Thus, the final rule is unchanged on that point.A housing authority recommended that a preference for living in substandardhousing should only be given if the unit is so bad that (i) it is actuallycondemned under the local housing code or (ii) repeated attempts to bringit into compliance with the code have failed. The Department does not believethat the rule should require use of such a narrow definition of ``substandard.''This definition would exclude from preferred treatment many applicantsfor housing assistance that have urgent housing needs and, thus, fit squarelywithin the class of individuals whom Congress intended to assist. In addition,the suggested definition would impose heavy administrative burdens on PHAs,owners, and applicants for tenancy in determining compliance with coderequirements both before and after efforts to correct the deficiencies,and would force applicants to endure substandard conditions for perhapslengthy periods, while any number of attempts to bring the unit up to codestandards are made. The Department does not believe that the rule shouldmandate such a definition.Another commenter suggested that verification of substandardness shouldrequire proof of an official inspection, rather than allowing the landlordto do it. This commenter contended that the landlord can certify to thepresence or absence of certain basics, such as operable indoor plumbingor electricity, but not to their adequacy or safety.The Department agrees that landlords may not possess the credentials necessaryto make a professional determination that a housing unit is unsafe or inadequate.The Department believes, however, that landlord verification should beretained, even in cases requiring judgment as to the unit's condition.The terms used in the regulation_such as the adequacy and safety of electricalservice or heat, and whether the unit's condition endangers the health,safety, or well-being of the tenant's family_are not technical, and arereadily comprehensible to the layman. Indeed, to the extent that the commenterfears that a landlord's judgment will err on the side of substandardness,the Department believes that the incentive runs the other way, since landlordswill be inclined to characterize their units as substandard only when theyin fact are. Depriving an applicant for housing assistance of this modeof verification, however, could impose additional delay and expense onthe applicant, and in cases where there is no governmental unit qualifiedto provide the verification required, would render qualification for apreference on this ground impossible. The Department notes that under therule, PHAs and owners could insist on a recitation of the facts underlyingthe alleged substandard condition of the unit to give them an adequatebasis to make an informed judgment. In addition, as noted above, PHAs incertain programs (but not owners) would be free to propose their own meansof verifying qualification for a preference on this ground.Another commenter argued that the verification process should require acertain lapse of time to determine whether the landlord is willing to bringthe unit into compliance with the applicable code, rather than using theunit's condition at a single given moment as the basis for the preference.This commenter stated that if the goal is to keep decent low-income housingstock on the market, there should be some pressure on the landlord to upgradethe unit and that tenants should not be encouraged to abandon the unitbecause of a preference system.Preliminarily, it should be noted that the goal of this rule making isnot to pressure landlords to bring their units up to code standard, butto target assistance to prospective tenants who have the greatest needfor housing assistance. Requiring a period of time within which a housingowner can try to bring a unit up to standard would entail a considerableadministrative burden on the PHA or project owner in monitoring and inspectingrepair efforts, and could result in excessive delays during which tenantswould be forced to live in substandard housing. Moreover, as a practicalmatter, the modes of verification contemplated by the rule would be unlikelyto support a preference based on a single point in time: verification basedon notice of substandard condition from a government agency would consumesome time during which a unit can be repaired (if the landlord so intends)and the landlord would be unlikely to characterize the unit as substandard,unless he or she had decided not to make the needed repairs. The finalrule is unchanged on that point.Another commenter believed that the definition of ``substandard'' shouldbe rooted in local housing codes, where available, rather than HUD regulations,because of the large differences among localities and regions of the country.For example, the commenter stated that in some jurisdictions, outdoor toiletfacilities are commonplace and acceptable under local codes. In the commenter'sview, to make all families without indoor toilets eligible for a preferencewould ``wreak havoc'' on the resources of PHAs in these areas.The Department does not believe that this comment requires a change inthe rule. As noted earlier, PHAs in certain programs may submit their owndefinitions of the preferences to make them more compatible with localcodes. In addition, the final rule permits both PHAs and project ownersto rank the preferences or their definitional elements (or both). Thus,for example, in areas where privies are common and accepted, the weightassigned a preference for this condition could be small. In any event,these factors ensure that implementation of the rule would not have thecatastrophic effects suggested by the comments.One commenter proposed that the definition of ``substandard housing'' shouldbe changed, because it includes as substandard Single Room Occupancy (SRO)units that HUD subsidizes under the Section 8 program. These units aredefined as units that contain no sanitary or food preparation facilities,or that contain one but not both types of facilities, and that are suitablefor occupancy by a single individual who is capable of independent living.The Department agrees with the commenter, and has added language to paragraph(f) of the final rule to make clear that SRO housing is not substandardsolely because it does not contain either or both of these facilities.One commenter thought that the rule should first provide for an evaluationof the relative merits of similarly situated families living in substandardhousing before it is determined which families should get the preference,because a family may choose to live in a substandard dwelling for personalreasons (<T3>e.g., </T3>to live near an infirm relative, or emotional attachmentto a particular neighborhood). The Department sees no need to require suchan evaluation. To the extent that a family occupies a substandard dwellingfor a particular personal reason, that family will not, presumably, applyfor assisted housing, since it may entail relocating. More importantly,interposing evaluative criteria in the rule would add a significant administrativeburden on PHAs and project owners in ferreting out the motives of applicantsfor assistance. (If, however, a PHA under 24 CFR Chapter IX or Part 882wished to distinguish among applicants on this basis, the rule does notprohibit it from doing so.)The final rule amends paragraph (f) to specify that ``homeless'' familiesare considered to be living in substandard housing for purposes of qualifyingfor a preference. This is a technical change to make clear that those whoseneed for housing assistance is more pressing_those who have no permanenthome at all_are living in ``substandard'' housing, and may qualify forpreferred status. A ``homeless family'' is defined to include any personor family that:(i) Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and(ii) Has a primary nighttime residence that is:(A) A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to providetemporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters,and transitional housing for the mentally ill);(B) An institution that provides a temporary residence for individualsintended to be institutionalized; or(C) A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as,a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. A ``homeless family''does not include any individual imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuantto an Act of the Congress or a State law.This definition is taken from section 103 of the Steward B. McKinney HomelessAssistance Act (Pub. L. 100-77, approved July 22, 1987). Use of this definitionwill enable the Department to target its housing assistance resources tothe same general class of families and individuals that are eligible forthe many housing and other initiatives contained in the McKinney Act. Thiscoordinated approach brings the greatest amount of resources to bear onthe homeless, and is clearly the most effective way of providing assistanceto these individuals and families.The Department again wishes to emphasize that identification of the homelessamong the types of applicants covered by the statutory preferences doesnot abrogate the responsibility of the PHA or owner to assure, on a case-by-casebasis, that all potential tenants are able and willing to live up to theobligation imposed by the dwelling lease. In addition, the fact that theseclasses of individuals may have preferred status does not allow PHAs andowners to divert housing resources to purposes not contemplated by thestatute, such as leasing assisted housing to entities other than income-eligiblefamilies or for the purpose of providing transient housing facilities ortemporary shelter. The final rule also amends paragraph (g) to specifythat verification of homelessness consists of written confirmation of thisstatus from a public or private facility that provides shelter for theseindividuals, or from the local police department or social services agency.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Fifty Percent of Income for Rent</ITAG>The proposed rule provided a preference for those paying more than 50 percentof their income for rent. Paragraph (i) defined ``rent'' to include actualutility payments in the case of tenant-furnished utilities. Some commenterscontended that inclusion of actual utility costs would encourage profligacyin energy consumption, rather than conservation, and would penalize thefamily that conserves energy, thereby paying less than 50 percent of itsincome for rent. It is unlikely, a commenter said, that Congress intendedthat the profligate family should get a preference at the expense of anenergy-conservative family. Another commenter recommended that the utilityallowance for the Section 8 Existing program be used in calculating ``rent,''with allowance for the use of actual utility bills in special circumstances.The Department does not believe that the commenters' concern_that includingactual utility expenses will encourage energy waste_is well-founded. Itis the unusual family that will be wasteful in its use of energy and, thus,its disposable income in the hope of getting a preference. HUD believesthat such premeditation is unlikely. The Department believes, however,that use of a utility allowance concept, except where the applicant prefersto use actual utility bills, is a good suggestion, and has amended thefinal rule accordingly. For PHAs and IHAs administering programs under24 CFR Chapter IX, the allowance would represent the PHA's or IHA's estimateof the cost of utilities. For the other programs covered by this rule,the allowance would be the Section 8 Existing utility allowance. This changeshould relieve some of the administrative burdens on PHAs and project ownersof verifying actual utility payments, while at the same time ensuring thatthe full amount of tenant-purchased utility costs are counted, where theyexceed the utility allowance.One commenter suggested that the rule be amended to exclude from ``rent''amounts received by or on behalf of a family to help defray utility expenses.The commenter believed that the rent-burden determination should take intoaccount only amounts actually paid by the family for shelter costs. TheDepartment agrees with this comment, and has amended paragraph (i) to makeclear that the utility component of ``rent'' is to be reduced by the amountof the subsidy under any energy assistance program, to the extent thatthis amount is not included in the family's income.One commenter suggested that the rule be amended to permit third-partyverification of an applicant's present rental and utility payments, forpurposes of determining qualification for the rent burden preference. Thecommenter contended that third-party verification is more accurate andreduces the incidence of fraud. The Department agrees with this comment,and has amended the final rule specifically to permit owners and PHAs toverify present rental payments with applicants' present landlords and toobtain the required utility expense information directly from the utilityprovider. This form of direct verification also would make clear PHAs'and project owners' authority to fill in gaps in applicants' records ofthe required documentation.  One commenter asserted that by including utility costs in the definitionor rent, higher income persons will qualify under the rent-burden preference.The Department is unsure of the point of this comment, but to the extentit questions inclusion of tenant-purchased utilities in the definitionof rent, the Department rejects it. This treatment of tenant-supplied utilitiesis a long-standing departmental policy, reflecting the fact that utilitycosts are part of overall shelter costs and that tenants should not betreated differently based on whether their utility costs are included inthe rent paid to the landlord or are paid separately.  One commenter suggested that in an effort to minimize collusion, the rent-burdenpreference should not be available where the tenant and the landlord arefriends or are related. The Department rejects this suggestion, becauseit may unfairly exclude honest applicants by establishing an irrebuttablepresumption of dishonesty based on consanguinity or friendship. Instead,the Department will depend on its investigative and enforcement effortsand those of PHAs and owners to disclose collusive acts intended to qualifyan applicant for a preference improperly.  The second part of this comment argued that to qualify for the rent-burdenpreference, the rule should provide that the applicant must hold a leasewith a term of 12 months or longer, and that the lease must have been enteredinto before the claim for a preference on this basis was made. The Departmentis not persuaded that the commenter's position should be adopted becausein many instances, for reasons unrelated to attempts to qualify for a preference,applicants do not have 12-month leases. Thus, if this requirement werewritten into the rule, many qualified applicants would be unfairly excludedfrom consideration for the grant of the rent-burden preference.  One commenter suggested that the defintion of ``rent'' be expanded to includepayments to amortize the purchase of a manufactured home, where the familyowns the home but rents the space on which it is located. The Departmentagrees with this comment. Although the rent-burden preference literallycovers only ``rental'' situations, treating a manufactured homeowner whorents the home's pad as a ``renter'' is consistent with the existing coverageunder section 8(j) of the 1937 Act. In addition, the final rule has beenamended to make clear that members of a cooperative housing regime are``renters'' for purposes of qualifying for the rent-burden preference.Like owners of manufactured homes who rent their pads, cooperative membersare considered renters under the Section 8 program. (See section 8(f)(2).)Paragraph (i) of the rule contains these changes.  The final rule also expands the types of documentation that may be usedto verify a tenant's rental payments, to include cancelled checks or moneyorder receipts. This is a minor change designed to ease applicants' verificationburdens while at the same time preserving the documentary nature of acceptableevidence of qualification for a preference.  Finally, the final rule adds a new paragraph (c)(6), specifying that anapplicant may not qualify for a rent-burden preference if the applicantis paying more than 50 percent of family income to rent a unit becausethe applicant's housing assistance with respect to that unit has been terminatedas a result of his or her refusal to comply with applicable program policiesand procedures regarding the occupancy of underoccupied and over-crowdedunits. This provision is analogous to the amendment discussed earlier,prohibiting an applicant that refuses to follow these policies and proceduresfrom claiming that any resulting displacement confers a preference on groundsof involuntary displacement.IV. Treatment of Waiting Lists  As noted earlier, the proposed rule envisioned a two-step process for awardinga Federal preference. (See paragraph (c).) Under this approach, applicantscould claim a preference when they applied for housing assistance, simplyby certifying that they met the required standards. Later, when they wereto be offered housing assistance, their actual qualification for a preferenceat that time would be verified by appropriate documentation. Under thissystem, it is possible for an applicant that qualified for a preferenceat the time of application to lose preferred status at the verificationstage.  One commenter argued that it is unfair to take preferred status away froman applicant that qualifies for a preference while on the waiting list,but loses the preference at the time assistance is to be provided. Thecommenter believed that applicants would have difficulty understandingthis situation, and that they are entitled to expect some degree of certaintywith respect to their positions on the waiting list. The commenter recommendedthat verification be at the time of application to ensure that ``cheaters''do not go to the top of the list. The commenter stated that because thereis usually a long time between application and offer of assistance, ``cheaters''may in fact be able to qualify for a preference before the verificationstage.  The statute requires that preference be given to applicants who are inone of the three preferred categories ``at the time they are seeking assistance.''The Department believes that an applicant is ``seeking assistance'' duringthe entire period from application to receipt of assistance. To hold otherwise,would, in the Department view, undermine the statutory objective of directinghousing assistance to those with the most urgent housing need, since (asin the commenter's example) the applicant does not qualify for a preference(and, thus, by definition, does not have an urgent need for housing assistance)at the time a unit is offered. Therefore, the Department believes thatthe statute does not permit, as the commenter urges, an applicant to retaina preference claimed at the time it applies for assistance, irrespectiveof later changes in the applicant's circumstances.  Further, the Department believes that any confusion that this two-stepapproach may cause should be minimized, if PHAs and project owners providethe information about how the preferences work that paragraph (a) of thefinal rule contemplates. Finally, the Department does not believe thatthe commenter's concern about ``cheaters'' abusing the two-step processjustifies imposition of full-scale verification at both the applicationand offer of assistance stages. It should be noted, however, that paragraph(c)(2) of the rule specifically permits PHAs and owners to provide forsuch verification, at their option. It should be noted also that the paragraph(c)(2) permits applicants to claim a Federal preference at any time whilethey are on a waiting list. This is intended to ensure that applicantsmay claim preferred status at any point in the process, and should helpassuage the commenter's fears that ``cheaters'' will falsely certify toqualification for a preference and gain an unfair advantage over <T3>bona fide </T3>applicants.  One commenter asked whether conventional public housing waiting lists stillare to be arranged within a given priority by incoming rent ranges. Asnoted above, section 6(c)(4)(A) of the 1937 Act requires PHAs operatingpublic housing programs to implement both the preferences and the ``broadrange of incomes'' requirement. PHAs are expected to use whatever techniquesare needed to meet the two requirements, including appropriate arrangementof waiting lists. Where both requirements cannot be satisfied, however,PHAs must give the preferences precedence.  A commenter suggested that the rule should allow PHAs to waive notificationto applicants on the waiting list whose position is not affected by theadoption of the three Federal preferences. This suggestion raises seriousissues of fairness, since PHAs and project owners may not know which familiesqualify for a preference without giving each family on the waiting listnotice of the availability of the preferences and an opportunity to demonstratethe family's qualification for a preference. Without this information,PHAs and owners may not be able to guage the effect of implementation ofthe rule on individual families on the waiting list. On the other hand,where a waiting list is very long, notification of <T3>all </T3>applicants on the list could be prohibitively expensive andcould hold little, if any, genuine benefit for many applicants, particularlythose at the bottom of the list.The Department has revised the final rule to give PHAs and owners someflexibility in implementing the notification requirement, while protectingthe legitimate interests of applicants who may qualify for a Federal preference.The amendment reiterates the requirement that all applicants (includingthose on waiting lists at or after implementation of the rule) be notifiedof the availability of the Federal preferences and be given an opportunityto demonstrate their qualification for them. It permits, however, PHAsand owners to give notice to fewer than all applicants on a waiting list<T3>at any given time,</T3> where the PHA or owner determines that universalnotice would be impracticable because of the list's length. The PHA orowner would instead be required to notify a sufficient number of applicantsat any given time to ensure that, based on the number of preference-holdersalready on the list and the expected availability of assistance, (1) thereis an adequate pool of applicants on the waiting list who are likely toqualify for a Federal preference and (2) it is unlikely that, on the basisof the PHA's or owner's system for applying the preferences and the preferencesclaimed by applicants already on the waiting list, any applicant who hasnot been notified would qualify for assistance before other applicantswhom the PHA or owner has notified. The Department believes that this approach is responsive to the concernsraised by the commenter, as well as the interests of applicants. It shouldbe noted that the degree of relief that this amendment will afford PHAsand owners will vary inversely with the complexity and number of gradationsin the preference heirarchy they adopt. As noted earlier, PHAs and ownersmay use local preferences as a way of distinguishing among Federal preference-holders,and may aggregate or rank the preferences or their components. The higherthe pyramid of preferences under these authorities, the less confidencea PHA or owner would have in reaching the required conclusion that it isunlikely that any applicant preference-holders who has not been notifiedwould receive assistance before preference-holders who have been. One commenter urged HUD to consider grandfathering all those on currentwaiting lists from the rule's implementation. The commenter urged thatthis be done in the interest of fairness to applicants that have been waitingfor housing for a long time. In the Department's review of the statuteand its legislative history, it has found no indication of Congressionalintent to grandfather those on the waiting lists. Indeed, the Congressionalsolicitude for directing assistance to those most in need of housing assistanceseems to cut the other way: implementation should not await the exhaustionof current waiting lists. It should be noted, however, as stated in the preamble to the proposedrule (49 FR 37788), that the Department is delaying the rule's implementationdate for 180 days after publication. This time is needed to permit PHAsand owners to take steps necessary for full implementation of the rule(including appropriate notice to those on waiting lists) and to give applicantson waiting lists who are notified an opportunity to gather material necessaryto demonstrate their qualification for a preference. As a practical matter,the six-month delayed effective date has the effect of grandfathering manywho are currently on waiting lists. A commenter viewed the rule's provision for notification to applicantson waiting lists as leading to confusion about how their status is affected,because (in the commenter's view) it carries the implication that (a) theirqualification is somehow now open to doubt, (b) they must take furthersteps to obtain verification or risk loss of their status, and (c) takingsteps to obtain new verification will obtain for them a better positionon the waiting list. The commenter viewed this last point as ``most insidious,''since, in the commenter's view, qualification for a preference will bealmost universal. The Department agrees that implementation of the preferences may causeapplicants some confusion and concern over the effect of the preferenceson their chances of receiving housing assistance. This is an inevitableconsequence of implementing the statutory mandate. However, PHAs and projectowners can minimize applicant concern and confusion by providing clearand complete information on the nature of the preferences, their effect,and how they may be obtained. As stated below, the Department does notbelieve that qualification for the preferences would be universal. One commenter feared that implementation of the preferences would adverselyaffect individuals who need emergency housing. The Department believesthat this fear is unfounded, since the preferences do not affect the provisionof temporary, emergency housing and, in any event, most families in needof emergency housing would also qualify for one or more of the preferences,with whatever weight within the preference system PHAs and owners choseto give such housing. Finally, a commenter argued that implementation of this rule would createpublic distrust of waiting lists and erode hard-earned public credibilityfor the assisted housing delivery system. The Department does not believethat the rule will have this effect, provided that it is implemented fairlyand in a way that is comprehensible to applicants for assistance_resultsthat are largely within the control of the PHAs and owners responsiblefor administering the preferences. V. Degree of Targeting A number of commenters asserted that the preference rule would have marginalimpact, since virtually all very low-income applicants for housing assistancewould qualify for at least one of the preferences. The Department doesnot agree with this assertion. Based on 1983 American Housing Survey (AHS) data, the Department estimatesthat approximately 55 percent of very low-income families unserved by ahousing assistance program may qualify for a preference, either becausethey are living in substandard housing or paying more than 50 percent oftheir income for rent. Very low-income families that may qualify for apreference solely because they are involuntarily displaced would be expectedto constitute a very small percentage of the families that are currentlyunserved by housing assistance programs. While the percentage of prefence-holderson current waiting lists may vary, it is clear that, on an overall basis,the preferences are responsive to the statutory objective of directinghousing assistance to those unserved, very low-income families that havethe most urgent housing needs. It should also be noted that use of thediscretion accorded PHAs and project owners in today's rule to aggregateor rank the preferences and their definitional components would have theeffect of further targeting assistance to the most needy <T3>among</T3> those who hold a preference. The Department intends to monitorcarefully the incidence of preference qualification generally, as wellas individual PHA and owner implementation of the preferences, to determinewhether any additional statutory or regulatory changes are needed to ensurethat the preferences carry out their intended targeting objective.VI. Social Effects of the Federal PreferencesA number of commenters expressed concern about the effect that the Federalpreferences would have on assisted housing projects and the assisted tenantpopulations. Some commenters stated that those paying more than 50 percentof their income for rent would always be welfare recipients. They believedthat by giving the rent-burden preference, the working poor would be penalized.If the rule goes into effect, these commenters emphasized, projects wouldend up with welfare clients only. This would defeat PHAs' attempts to housea social and economic cross-section of tenants, and would result in managementand maintenance problems. Other commenters saw the regulations as providingprimarily minorities with a preference, thus assuring that public housingwould become predominantly minority-occupied and ``ghettoized.'' This wouldresult, they argued, in further burdens on housing authorities and citygovernments. Another commenter stated that projects historically work best with a socialand economic mix of all races, and that once projects become 50 percentminority-occupied, it is impossible to ``turn them around.'' This commenterstated that most families that would qualify for a preference are minority,and a large percentage are on welfare and will stay there, ``as long asHUD and Congress give them preferential treatment.''The Department takes issue with these comments. Analysis of American HousingSurvey data suggests that, nationwide, neither black nor welfare householdsare likely to predominate as a result of the implementation of the rent-burdenpreference. For example, only 21 percent of the very low-income, unsubsidizedhouseholds paying at least 50 percent of their income for rent are black.This is nearly equal to blacks' representation among all very low-incomehouseholds (22 percent). The proportion (29 percent) of welfare householdsamong all high rent-to-income households (family and elderly) is slightlygreater than their overall proportion (24 percent) among very low-incomehouseholds. However, neither the relative nor absolute share of welfarehouseholds is dominant. It is possible that in different areas there would be different impactsas a result of the implementation of the preferences. Nonetheless, familiesthat qualify for preferred status will receive a preference in the selectionof tenants_without regard to race or source of income. Indeed, any systemthat attempted to discriminate on either of these grounds would raise gravelegal and public issues. Some commenters also specifically cited the rent-burden preference as destructiveof a sound policy of housing a cross-section of income ranges. A tenantmix reflective of the surrounding neighborhood is vital, argued a commenter,to keep public housing desirable. These commenters thought that the rulewould be a disincentive to the working poor, and would result in the workingpoor not being housed. Congress, the comments said, is reneging on an importantaspect_income mix_that is necessary to eliminate pockets of poverty andreduce crime and vandalism. As noted earlier, PHAs are required to implement both the preference provisionsand the ``broad range of incomes'' requirement in section 6(c)(4)(A) ofthe 1937 Act, and must subordinate the range of incomes to the preferencesonly where both provisions cannot be satisfied. The Department does notbelieve that implementation of this rule would have the effects that thecommenters fear. VII. Tenant MobilitySome commenters criticized the proposed rule on grounds that it would discourageresidents or assisted housing from moving from one jurisdiction to another,since, as long as they lived in assisted housing, they would be unableto qualify for a preference and, therefore, would have to move to substandardhousing or pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent in order tohave a realistic chance of receiving housing assistance again. The commenterbelieved that this result conflicted with the goal of promoting housingchoice and HUD's commitment to interjurisdictional transfers using Section8 Existing assistance (the ``portability'' concept under the Housing Voucherprogram). Another commenter raised the same issue with respect to intrajurisdictionalmoves_for example, where an assisted family wants to move closer to a job,but remains within its current PHA's jurisdiction. Some moves_both inter- and intra-jurisdictional_are not subject to thisrule. An assisted family that moves within the same program administeredby a PHA (such as from one public housing unit to another or from one unitto another with a Certificate, within the same PHA's jurisdiction), orwithin a project (one or more buildings managed as a single project) controlledby a private owner, generally is not subject to meeting the preferencerequirements, because the assisted family moves without losing its assistedstatus. The Department considers this type of move to be internal to thePHA or to the project owner's operation, and not to be an event that requiresreapplication for assistance. An assisted family that moves outside the program administered by a PHAmay or may not be subject to the preference requirements, depending onthe circumstances and as discussed below. As one commenter point out, theDepartment strongly encourages the interjurisdictional transfer (or ``portability'')of Section 8 Certificates and Housing Vouchers. Indeed, the Housing Voucherprogram requires ``portability'' between jurisdictions operating HousingVoucher programs, and encourages portability of Vouchers between Certificateand Housing Voucher jurisdictions. In addition, there are in place manyvoluntary mobility programs around the country. In all of these cases,when the assisted family actually brings the assistance with it, as isprovided in the required Housing Voucher portability program, or as isprovided in many of the voluntary mobility programs in which the PHAs exchangeCertificates or Housing Vouchers, there is no reapplication for assistance;the assisted family is not subject to the preference rule. However, in any case where the assisted family is placed on the waitinglist (even though it may be at the bottom), the family is considered tobe reapplying for assistance, and, therefore, is subject to the preferencerule. As some of the commenters stated, application of the preferencesto assisted tenants could severely restrict their ability to move amongjurisdictions and housing programs, since assisted tenants, by definition,generally cannot qualify for a Federal preference. Commenters felt that,in many cases, literal application of the preference rule would imposea significant impediment to mobility that is not present in the currentsystem. The Department shares the concerns expressed by the commenters. Indeed,as a commenter noted, HUD has been a long and ardent advocate of mobilityfor assisted tenants. On the other hand, most tenants receiving housing assistance under theprograms subject to the rule have by definition achieved the very statethat the preferences are intended to produce: residence in a standard unitwith affordable rent. Providing these tenants a preference if they wishto move could place them ahead of other preferred tenants who must endurethe conditions that qualified them for a preference for a longer period,before assistance can be made available for them. Arguably, this resultis neither fair as a policy matter, nor significantly faithful to the Congressionalconcern that housing assistance be directed to those with the most pressinghousing needs. The Department believes that the issues involved in ``mobility'' for assistedtenants under the final rule are best addressed after a notice and commentrulemaking. Therefore, the Department will issue a proposed rule dealingwith the interrelationship between the Federal preferences and assistedtenants whose admission to another program or project involves placementon a waiting list. The Department will attempt to make this rulemakingeffective at or shortly after this final rule's implementation_180 daysafter publication. However, if the rule does not take effect until afterimplementation of this final rule, assisted tenants who wish to move toanother project or program, but are first placed on a waiting list, mustdemonstrate their qualification for a preference in the same way as unassistedapplicants.VIII. Potential for Fraud and Abuse in Qualifying for a Federal PreferenceA general criticism of the proposed rule was that it would encourage familiesto create situations that would give them a preference and lead to manipulationand abuse to the disadvantage of the honest applicant. A further criticismwas that the rule would encourage collusion between landlords and tenantssince, by allowing the landlord to provide verification as to an applicant'sstatus, the rule would put the landlord in a position to falsify factsto get rid of, or to help, individual tenants. It also was claimed thatthe rule would have the effect of encouraging applicants that live in substandardhousing to remain there, so that they may gain a better position on thewaiting list.The Department agrees that there are those_both landlords and tenants_whomay resort to fraud and abuse to further their own interests: no programis immune from such practices. With respect to this rule, however, theDepartment has had to balance fraud and abuse considerations along witha number of other factors, including the administrative costs to HUD, aswell as to PHAs and project owners, of imposing more stringent verificationand investigatory requirements, and the ability of applicants for assistanceto demonstrate their qualification for a preference without unnecessaryburdens or restrictions. The Department has reviewed the approach takenin the proposed rule in light of the public comments, and continues tobelieve that this approach strikes an appropriate balance among the considerationsinvolved.The Department has drafted the verification provisions of the rule to minimizethe incidence of fraud and abuse. These provisions focus on objectivelyverifiable, independent sources to establish qualification for a preference.Thus, paragraphs (e) and (g) of this rule include, as appropriate meansof verification, written notice from governmental entities as to claimsof involuntary displacement or residence in substandard housing. Paragraph(j) requires PHAs and owners to verify a family's income in accordancewith well-known, existing procedures for HUD's assistance programs, which(among other things) provide for the use of release and consent forms toassist verification. Paragraph (j) also provides for verification of anapplicant's rent by production of pertinent lease documents or direct contactwith the applicant's current landlord, and verification of an applicant'sutility expenses, either by reference to a utility allowance concept inlieu of actual utility bills, or (where the applicant elects to use actualutility expenses) actual utility consumption data furnished by the applicantor by the utility provider.It is true that landlords are permitted to provide verification for claimsof displacement stemming from the landlord's actions or from the substandardnature of the dwelling. In addition, verification of involuntary displacementbased on domestic violence may come from clergymen or physicians, and verificationof domestic violence and homelessness could come from private sheltersand other facilities. The Department believes that, in some cases, thesetypes of verification may be the only timely and, perhaps the only, availablemeans of verification. To disallow these means of verification becausethey may be subject to abuse could have the effect of denying applicantsreasonable access to demonstrate qualification for a preference. Moreover,each of these forms of verification must be in writing, thereby creatinga record that should both deter abuse and assist in prosecution in thoseinstances in which abuse is found.On the other hand, the Department does not believe that it would be cost-effectiveto impose additional verification requirements on PHAs and owners, andthrough them, on prospective tenants. For example, a number of the commentersargued that verification should include a finding as to an applicant'smotivation for a given decision, such as a decision to move to (or to remainin) a substandard unit. Even though this inquiry might expose some casesof abuse, the Department does not believe that requiring such a staff-intensiveeffort is cost-effective. It is adequate, in the Department's view, simplyto demonstrate the fact of substandard housing and to grant the preferenceupon that basis.The Department intends to be sensitive to indications of fraud, waste,and abuse under this rule in the course of established, on-site monitoringreviews, and will take whatever regulatory or other action is appropriatein light of this experience. Finally, it should be noted that PHAs operatingprograms under 24 CFR Parts 882, 904, 905, or 960 are free to establishtheir own verification standards and procedures (which can be more stringentthan those prescribed in this rule), at the PHAs' option.IX. Administrative BurdensA number of commenters expressed concern that conversion to, and maintenanceof, a system for administering the preferences would impose on PHAs andowners considerable administrative and legal burdens for which HUD willnot compensate them. Some considered the two-step certification/verificationprocess to be wasteful, since they believed that it would, in effect, createa ``revolving door,'' in which the same applicant would repeatedly makepreference claims that are later denied. One commenter proposed an alternativesystem under which qualification for the preferences would be determinedonly at the point at which assistance is to be offered. Under this approach,families on the waiting list would be screened for qualification for apreference, with those not qualifying returned to the waiting list.Others found the requirement that applicants for housing assistance (includingthose currently on waiting lists) be notified of the availability of thepreferences to be excessively costly, and recommended alternatives, suchas posting notice of the preferences in PHAs' offices. Still others foundthe PHA's or project owner's verification responsibilities to be onerous.Specifically, some indicated a belief that the proposed rule would requirePHAs to make ``home visits'' to determine whether the unit is substandard;some believed that verification when assistance is offered would requireverification of an applicant's status not only at that point, but alsowhen the applicant originally certified to his or her qualification fora preference.The Department recognizes that PHAs and owners have to carry out additionaladministrative tasks to implement and maintain the preference system. Therule has been drafted, however, to keep these burdens to the absolute minimumnecessary to carry out the statutory mandate. Specifically, the Departmentcontinues to believe that the two-step certification/verification processcontained in the proposed rule is the clearest and least burdensome wayof administering the preferences. It focuses the verification of preferenceclaims at the only time that verification is needed_when assistance isto be offered the applicant_and, through initial certification, narrowsthe pool of applicants that PHAs and owners must review at the verificationstage. The Department believes that omission of the certification stagein the alternative proposed by a commenter would often lead to a more burdensomeprocedure than that contemplated by the final rule, since a PHA or ownermay have to contact and process a number of applicants before it even reachesan applicant claiming a preference.It is true that some PHAs and project owners may incur some costs in contactingapplicants currently on waiting lists. Since the Department believes thatthe statute was intended to cover those on waiting lists, there is no alternativeto requiring individual notice. As discussed earlier, however, the Departmenthas modified the proposed rule to permit notification of less than allapplicants on the waiting list at any given time. This revision shouldenable PHAs and project owners to avoid the costs and administrative burdensassociated with mass notifications. In any event, these costs are one-time,start-up expenses, and will not recur once the preference system is inplace. Although the rule requires PHAs and owners to notify future applicantsof the availability of the Federal preferences, this can be done in thesame way that tenants are given notice of other tenant selection standards.The Department has specifically drafted the verification procedures containedin today's rule to minimize administrative costs. As noted earlier, therule relies on written documentation from agencies of government to theextent feasible. These documents should be readily verifiable, withoutthe need for further investigation. Verification from other sources (suchas landlords) must also be in writing, but may require further verification.As mentioned before, the Department believes that use of this form of verificationis necessary to provide applicants a reasonable opportunity to show thatthey qualify for a preference.With respect to the specific points raised in the comments, the rule doesnot require PHAs to make ``home visits'' to determine whether a unit issubstandard. Only written verification from the local government or theapplicant's present landlord is required. At the verification stage, theonly inquiry is whether the applicant qualifies for a preference at thattime. Neither this rule nor its predecessor contemplates a determinationas to whether the applicant's earlier certification as to qualificationfor a preference was correct. The rule also makes clear that the applicantbears the burden of producing the required documentation, except in thosecases where third-party verification is needed.Finally, the Department believes that administrative costs associated withestablishing and maintaining the preference system_including one-time,start-up costs_should be absorbed by the PHAs and project owners. The Departmentdoes not believe that administering the preferences will involve significantcosts over the long term. Moreover, in a number of instances, PHAs andowners should be able to apply established procedures to their administrationof the preferences. For example, paragraph (j) of the final rule specificallyprovides that owners and PHAs should verify ``income'' for purposes ofthe rent-burden preference in the same way as they do for initial determinationsof eligibility and annual reexaminations of income under the program involved.Use of existing procedures should help to minimize PHA and owner administrativecosts. Further, a number of PHAs already provide preferences analogousto those required under this rule, without (to the Department's knowledge)the kinds of excessive burdens that the commenters suggested. Thus, theDepartment does not anticipate a need to provide additional funding toenable PHAs and owners to administer the preferences.X. Informal Review of Federal Preference DenialsSeveral commenters expressed uncertainty as to whether the proposed rulecontemplated some form of informal review of the decision of a PHA or projectowner to deny an applicant's qualification for a preference. In responseto these comments, this rule contains a new paragraph (k) to make clearthat the owner or PHA must provide prompt, written notice to the applicantof a determination denying a preference (including a brief statement ofthe reasons for the determination), and give the applicant an opportunityto meet with the PHA or owner (or its representative) to review the denial.The Department believes that this ``notice and opportunity for meeting''approach strikes an appropriate balance among the competing interests involvedin the denial of a preference. On the one hand, this approach recognizesthe importance of qualification for a preference in securing housing assistanceat the earliest time, by establishing a mandatory mechanism for the promptresolution of factual issues and concerns. On the other hand, use of thisdegree of informal procedure reflects the Department's belief that thedenial of a preference_which has the effect of prolonging an applicant'swait for housing assistance_is not of such magnitude as to justify impositionof the administrative burdens on PHAs and project owners that are inherentin a more formal process.The new paragraph (k) provides that the meeting is to be conducted by anyperson or persons designated by the owner or PHA, including an officeror employee of the PHA or project owner, or the person who denied or reviewedthe denial of a preference, or his or her subordinate. The Department believesthat permitting the individual who denied or reviewed the denial of a preferenceto conduct the meeting amply supports the fairness of the process, giventhe essentially factual focus of the inquiry, the effect on the applicantof a preference denial, and the need to minimize the administrative burdenson PHAs and project owners, particularly PHAs and owners with limited staffresources. The rule contains a provision found in the informal review provisionsof the existing housing assistance regulations, stating that the availabilityof informal process for denial of a preference does not affect other rightsthat the applicant may have regarding discrimination on the basis of race,color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. This provisionmakes clear an applicant's existing right to protection from unlawful discrimination.The final rule also amends the informal review procedures in the existingregulations to make clear that the special provisions contained in paragraph(k) apply in the case of preference denials.Finally, the Department wishes to stress that the administrative reviewrequirements contained in this rule apply only to the issue of whetherthe applicant meets the criteria for receiving a preference. They do notapply to matters such as the propriety of the PHA's or owner's system forapplying the preferences or alternate definitions of the preference categoriesthat PHAs in certain programs may establish. These matters reflect policychoices that are committed to the discretion of PHAs and project owners,consistent with HUD's requirements. The Department does not believe thatthe informal meeting contemplated by this rule is an appropriate forumfor considering challenges to PHAs' or project owners' overall policies.XI. MiscellaneousA commenter asserted that there is currently no HUD handbook for StateHousing Finance Agencies (HFAs). This led the commenter to inquire whetherHUD intended that HFAs comply with Handbook 4350.3, <T3>Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Program,</T3>in light of the reference in paragraph (j)(1) of the rule that verificationof income be in accordance with existing procedures.HFAs are subject to Handbook 4350.3. This was explicitly stated in theHandbook revisions issued as Change-1 on March 7, 1985, and later clarifiedin a memorandum to State Agency Directors on April 17, 1985. Paragraph1-6.b. of Handbook 4350.3 CHG-1 states that HFAs may enforce State requirements,in addition to the Handbook requirements, if the State requirements donot conflict with the Handbook or with HUD regulations. Paragraph 1-6.b.(2)further states that, if any HFA policies conflict with the Handbook, theAgency must certify that the policies do not conflict with applicable statutesand regulations.One commenter recommended that language similar to andSection;andSection; 880.603(b)(2),881.603(b)(2), and 883.704(b)(2) of the proposed rule be added in Parts882, 884, and 886. These sections of the proposed rule provided that, ifa family is entitled to a preference, the owner must accept the family'sapplication and place the family on the waiting list, notwithstanding thatthere already exists a 12-month waiting period for all or some applicants.This was an exception to the existing provision that states:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likelyto be admitted for the next 12 months, the owner may advise the applicantthat no additional applications are being accepted for that reason.</ITAG>The Department agrees with this comment, and has extended the provisionsof the proposed rule (with some modifications) to all the Parts coveredby this rule making. Specifically, this rule provides that, notwithstandingthe fact that a project owner or PHA is not accepting applications becauseof the length of the waiting list, it may not refuse to accept an applicationfrom an applicant who claims qualification for a preference or to placethe applicant (if otherwise eligible) on the waiting list, unless it determines,on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waitinglist and claim a preference, and the anticipated turn-over of assistance,that: (1) There is an adequate pool of applicants on the list who are likelyto qualify for a Federal preference and (2) it is unlikely that, on thebasis of the PHA's or owner's system for applying the programs, the preferencethe applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants alreadyon the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for assistance beforethose who are on the waiting list. This provision is designed to ensurethat there is an ample supply of preferred applicants on the waiting list,despite the fact that the waiting list may be closed to those who do notclaim a preference. The Department recognizes that maintaining a waitinglist that is heavily weighted towards applicants with a preference mayoperate effectively to preclude applicants without a Federal preferencefrom assisted housing, especially where housing resources are severelylimited; however, in the Department's view, this possibility is an unavoidableresult of the statute.The Department has also amended the proposed rule to make clear that thepreferences apply to the selection of tenants to receive assistance underthe Rent Supplement and Section 8 programs, rather than the selection foradmission to a project assisted under these programs. This is a technicalchange, to reflect the fact that projects under these programs may be partiallysubsidized and that the preferences apply to the selection of tenants toreceive rental assistance, not to the admission of tenants to units withoutsuch assistance. (This issue does not arise in the Section 8 Certificateor public housing programs, since there are no ``partially subsidized''projects under these authorities.)The Department also wishes to note the following regarding partially subsidizedRent Supplement and Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitationprojects. Under current practice, a family that is seeking rental assistanceand that qualifies for a preference may, because of the unavailabilityof subsidy, move into a partially assisted project without rental assistance,with the express understanding that the family will receive a subsidy whenit becomes available. If the housing owner verifies that the family qualifiesfor a Federal preference when it is admitted to the project, the Departmentbelieves that the owner may honor this understanding, without requiringthe family to demonstrate independent qualification for a preference whenthe rental assistance is in fact offered. The Department views the admissionwithout subsidy in these circumstances as an interim measure, and doesnot believe the admission should have the potential effect of divestingthe family of the preferred status for which it has qualified.As a related matter under the Section 8 and Rent Supplement programs, atenant's eligibility for assistance continues until the rent payable bythe tenant equals the full market rent for the unit. The termination ofeligibility at this point does not ``preclude the resumption of paymentsas a result of later changes in income, rents or other relevant circumstancesduring the term of the contract.'' (See andSection;andSection; 215.55(c), 880.603(c)(3),881.603(c)(3), 882.212(c), 882.515(e), 883.704(c)(3), 886.124(c), and 886.324(c).)The Department believes that resumption of payments in these circumstancesoccurs without regard to whether the tenant qualifies for a preferenceat the time of resumption. A tenant who once establishes eligibility forrental assistance does not lose his or her right to receive assistancesolely because the actual receipt of assistance may be interrupted.Finally, the final rule contains a number of technical modifications tothe proposed rule. Chief among these are the following. The proposed rulewould have made only a few conforming changes to the existing regulatoryframework. The final rule is fully woven into the existing regulations.In addition, the proposed amendment to 24 CFR Part 905 (Indian Housing)only covered the Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity program. This ruleextends the applicability of the preferences to all of Part 905, as contemplatedby the preference statute and the original proposed rule.Findings and Certifications A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementSection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 SeventhStreet, SW., Washington, DC 20410. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin Section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. As noted in detail in the earlierdiscussion on ``Administrative Burdens'', the Department has taken greatcare to minimize the rule's burdens on all PHAs and project owners (includingsmall entities), and does not believe that administering the preferenceswould involve significant costs over the long term. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

In Part 215, a new andSection; 215.22 is added, to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 215.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Federal selection preferences. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> (1) In selecting applicants for assistance under thispart, housing owners must give preference to applicants who are otherwisequalified for assistance and who, at the time they are seeking housingassistance, are involuntarily displaced, living in substandard housing,or paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent. Only qualifiedtenants, as defined in andSection; 215.20, are eligible to receive a preference.(2)(i) The housing owner must inform all applicants for assistance underthis part of the availability of the Federal preferences, and must giveall applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference.For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(i), applicants include those on anywaiting list maintained by the owner for the project when this sectionis implemented or thereafter. (ii) If the housing owner determines that the notification to all applicantson a waiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticablebecause of the length of the list, the owner may provide this notificationto fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The owner must,however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given timethat, on the basis of the owner's determination of the number of applicantson the waiting list who already claim a Federal preference, and the anticipatednumber of admissions to the project: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify fora Federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the owner's framework for applyingthe preferences under paragraph (b) and the preferences claimed by thosealready on the waiting list, any applicant who has not been so notifiedwould qualify for admission to the project before those who have receivednotification. (3) For purposes of this section, the term ``Federal preference'' meansa tenant selection preference provided under this section. The term ``preference''means a Federal preference, unless the context indicates otherwise. (b) <T3>Applying the Federal preferences.</T3> (1) Each housing owner mustinclude the Federal preferences in its tenant selection policies. The ownermust apply the Federal preferences in a manner that is consistent withthe provisions of this section and other applicable requirements (includingapplicable limitations on the use of local residency requirements and preferences).(2) The housing owner must establish a system for applying the preferencesthat provides that an applicant who qualifies for any of the Federal preferencesis to receive assistance under this part before any other applicant whois not so qualified, without regard to the other applicant's qualificationfor one or more preferences or priorities that are not provided by Federallaw, place on any waiting list, or the time of submission of his or herapplication for assistance. In applying the preferences under this paragraph(b)(2), the owner may determine the relative weight to be accorded theFederal preferences, through means such as: (i) Applying non-Federal preferences or priorities (such as local residencypreferences) as a way of ranking applicants who qualify (or claim qualification)for a Federal preference; (ii) Aggregating the Federal preferences (<T3>i.e.,</T3> two Federal preferences outweigh one and three outweightwo); (iii) Ranking the Federal preferences (<T3>e.g.,</T3> provide that an applicant living in substandard housinghas greater need for housing than (and, therefore, would be consideredfor assistance before) an applicant paying more than 50 percent of incomefor rent); or (iv) Ranking the Federal preferences' definitional elements (<T3>e.g.,</T3> provide that those living in housing that is dilapidatedor has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of governmenthave a greater need for housing than, and take precedence over, those whosehousing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub orshower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family). (3) Any selection preferences or priorities under this section or otherwisethat are used by a housing owner must be established and administered ina manner that is not incompatible with Title VI of the Civil Rights Actof 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42U.S.C. 3601-19; Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing,27 FR 11527 (1962), <T3>as amended,</T3> 46 FR 1253 (1980); Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101-07; or HUD's regulations and requirements issued under these authorities.Such preferences and priorities must also be consistent with HUD's affirmativefair housing objectives and (if applicable) the owner's HUD-approved AffirmativeFair Housing Marketing Plan. (4) The owner must submit to HUD any selection preference system that usesa local residency preference, for review for consistency with the requirementsof paragraph (b)(3), but HUD approval is not required before the ownermay implement the system. (5) Local residency requirements are prohibited. Local residency preferencesmay be applied in selecting tenants only to the extent that they are notinconsistent with HUD's affirmative fair housing objectives and (if applicable)the owner's HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan. Withrespect to any residency preference, persons expected to reside in thecommunity as a result of current or planned employment must be treatedas residents.

(2)(i) The owner must inform all applicants for assistance under this partof the availability of the Federal preferences, and must give all applicantsan opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference. For purposesof this paragraph (a)(2)(i), applicants include families on any waitinglist maintained by the owner for the project when this section is implementedor thereafter.  (ii) If the owner determines that the notification to all applicants ona waiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticablebecause of the length of the list, the owner may provide this notificationto fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The owner must,however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given timethat, on the basis of the owner's determination of the number of applicantson the waiting list who already claim a Federal preference, and the anticipatednumber of admissions to the project: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify fora Federal preference; and  (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the owner's framework for applyingthe preferences under paragraph (b) of this section and the preferencesclaimed by those already on the waiting list, any applicant who has notbeen so notified would be admitted to the project before those who havereceived notification.

(2)(i) The PHA must inform all applicants for a Certificate of Family Participationof the availability of the Federal preferences, and must give all applicantsan opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference. For purposesof this paragraph (a)(2)(i), applicants include families on any waitinglist for a Certificate of Family Participation maintained by the PHA whenthis section is implemented or thereafter. (ii) If the PHA determines that the notification to all applicants on awaiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticablebecause of the length of the list, the PHA may provide this notificationto fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The PHA must,however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given timethat, on the basis of the PHA's determination of the number of applicantson the waiting list who already claim a Federal preference, and the anticipatednumber of Certificates to be issued: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify fora Federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's framework for applyingthe preferences under paragraph (b) of this section and the preferencesclaimed by those already on the waiting list, any applicant who has notbeen so notified would be issued a Certificate before those who have receivednotification. (3) PHAs must apply the definitions of ``standard, permanent replacementhousing''; ``involuntary displacement''; ``substandard housing''; ``homelessfamily''; ``family income''; and ``rent'' set forth in paragraphs (c)(5),(d), (f), (h), and (i), respectively of this section, unless the PHA submitsalternative definitions for HUD's review and approval. PHAs may apply theverification procedures contained in paragraphs (e), (g), and (j) of thissection or they may, in their own discretion and without HUD approval,adopt verification procedures of their own. (4) For purposes of this section, the term ``Federal preference'' meansa tenant selection preference provided under this section. The term ``preference''means a Federal preference, unless the context indicates otherwise. (b) <T3>Applying the Federal preferences.</T3> (1) Each PHA must include theFederal preferences in its policies and procedures for selecting applicantsfor participation under andSection; 882.209. The PHA must apply the Federalpreferences in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of thissection, the nondiscrimination requirements of andSection; 882.111, the selectionand participation provisions of andSection; 882.209 (including limitationson the use of local residency requirements and preferences contained inandSection; 882.209(a)(4)(i)), and other applicable requirements. (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, thePHA must establish a system for applying the Federal preferences that providesthat an applicant who qualifies for any of the Federal preferences is tobe issued a Certificate of Family Participation before any other applicantwho is not so qualified, without regard to the other applicant's qualificationfor one or more preferences or priorities that are not provided by Federallaw, place on the waiting list, or the time of submission of an applicationfor a Certificate. (ii) The PHA's system for applying the Federal preferences may providefor circumstances in which applicants who do not qualify for a Federalpreference are issued a Certificate of Family Participation before otherapplicants who are so qualified. Not more than 10 percent of the applicantswho are initially issued a Certification of Family Participation in anyone-year period (or such shorter period selected by the PHA before thebeginning of its first full year under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)) may beapplicants referred to in the preceding sentence. (iii) In applying the preferences under this paragraph (b)(2), the PHAmay determine the relative weight to be accorded the Federal preferences,through means such as:(A) Applying non-Federal preferences or priorities as a way of rankingapplicants who qualify for a Federal preference (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that applicants who qualify for a Federal preferenceand a local residency preference take precedence over non-resident Federalpreference-holders; or provide that applicants whose rents were increasedbeyond 50 percent of their incomes after completion of Rental Rehabilitationactivities are ranked higher than those who meet the rent burden standardbecause of other reasons);(B) Aggregating the Federal preferences (<T3>i.e., </T3>two Federal preferences outweigh one and three outweightwo);(C) Ranking the Federal preferences (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that an applicant living in substandard housinghas greater need for housing than (and, therefore, would be consideredfor assistance before) an applicant paying more than 50 percent of incomefor rent); or(D) Ranking the Federal preferences' definitional elements (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that those living in housing that is dilapidatedor has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of governmenthave a greater need for housing than, and take precedence over, those whosehousing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub orshower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family).(3) Any selection preferences or priorities under this section or otherwisethat are used by a PHA must be established and administered in a mannerthat is not incompatible with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. 2000d; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.3601-19; Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing, 27 FR11527(1962), <T3>as amended, </T3>46 FR 1253 (1980); Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101-07; or HUD's regulations and requirements issued under these authorities.Such preferences and priorities must also be consistent with HUD's affirmativefair housing objectives.(4) In the case of an applicant who resides within the jurisdiction ofan Indian Housing Authority (IHA) that is not administering a Section 8Existing Housing program, the applicable utility allowancy for purposesof calculating rent under paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, willbe determined under 24 CFR Part 965, Subpart E.(c) <T3>Qualifying for a Federal preference. </T3>(1) An applicant qualifiesfor a Federal preference if_(i) The applicant has been involuntarily displaced and is not living instandard, permanent replacement housing or, within no more than six monthsfrom the date of certification under paragraph (c)(2) of this section orverification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (as appropriate), theapplicant will be involuntarily displaced;(ii) The applicant is living in substandard housing; or (iii) the applicantis paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In the case of an applicant occupying a unit that has been or is beingrehabilitated under the Rental Rehabilitation Program (see 24 CFR Part511), the applicant will be considered as paying more than 50 percent ofits income for rent if the applicant has been notified that following completionof rehabilitation its rent will be increased, and the applicant in factwould be required, no later than 60 days from the date the applicant isissued a Certificate of Family Participation assistance under this part,to pay more than 50 percent of its income to continue renting the rehabilitationunit.(2) Applicants may claim qualification for a Federal preference when theyapply for a Certificate of Family Participation (or thereafter until aCertificate is issued) by certifying to the PHA that they qualify for preferredstatus under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The PHA must accept thiscertification, unless it verifies that the applicant is not qualified forpreferred status.(3) Before issuing a Certificate of Family Participation to an applicantwho qualifies for one on the basis of a Federal preference, the PHA mustrequire the applicant to provide verification that he or she qualifiesfor Federal preference under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by virtureof the applicant's current status. The applicant's current status mustbe determined without regard to whether there has been a change in theapplicant's qualification for a Federal preference between the certificationunder paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the issuance of a Certificate,including a change from one Federal preference category to another.(4) If an applicant's qualification for a Federal preference under paragraph(c)(1) of this section has once been verified, the PHA need not requirethe applicant to verify such qualification again, unless, as determinedby the PHA, such a long time has elapsed since verification as to makereverification desirable, or the PHA has reasonable grounds to believethat the applicant no longer qualifies for a Federal preference.(5) For purposes of this paragraph (c), ``standard, permanent replacementhousing'' is housing_(i) That is decent, safe, and sanitary;(ii) That is adequate for the family size; and(iii) That the family is occupying pursuant to a lease or occupancy agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such housing does not include transient facilities, such as motels,hotels, or temporary shelters for victims of domestic violence or homelessfamilies, and in the case of domestic violence referred to in paragraph(d)(2) of this section, does not include the housing unit in which theapplicant and the applicant's spouse or other member of the household whoengages in such violence live.(6) An applicant may not qualify for a Federal preference under paragraph(c)(1)(iii) of this section if the applicant is paying more than 50 percentof family income to rent a unit because the applicant's housing assistanceunder the United States Housing Act of 1937 or section 101 of the Housingand Urban Development Act of 1965 with respect to that unit has been terminatedas a result of its refusal to comply with applicable program policies andprocedures with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowdedunits.

The informal review provisions for thedenial of a Federal selection preference under andSection; 882.517 are containedin paragraph (k) of that section. 17. In Part 882, a new andSection; 882.517 is added, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 882.517</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Federal selection preferences. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> (1) In selecting applicants for assistance under thissubpart, a PHA must give preference to families that are otherwise eligiblefor assistance and that, at the time they are seeking housing assistance,are involuntarily displaced, living in substandard housing, or paying morethan 50 percent of family income for rent. (2)(i) The PHA must inform all applicants for assistance under this subpartof the availability of the Federal preferences, and must give all applicantsan opportunity to show that they qualify for a preference. For purposesof this paragraph (a)(2)(i), applicants include families on any waitinglist for assistance under this part maintained by the PHA when this sectionis implemented or thereafter. (ii) If the PHA determines that the notification to all applicants on awaiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticablebecause of the length of the list, the PHA may provide this notificationto fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The PHA must,however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given timethat, on the basis of the PHA's determination of the number of applicantson the waiting list who already claim a Federal preference, and the anticipatednumber of admissions under this part: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify fora Federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's framework for applyingthe preferences under paragraph (b) of this section and the preferencesclaimed by those already on the waiting list, any applicant who has notbeen so notified would be admitted before those who have received notification.(3) PHAs must apply the definitions of ``standard, permanent replacementhousing''; ``involuntary displacement''; ``substandard housing''; homelessfamily''; ``family income''; and ``rent'' set forth in paragraphs (c)(5),(d), (f), (h), and (i), respectively, of this section, unless the PHA submitsalternative definitions for HUD's review and approval. PHAs may apply theverification procedures contained in paragraphs (e), (g), and (j) of thissection, or they may adopt verification procedures of their own. (4) For purposes of this section, the term ``Federal preference'' meansa tenant selection preference provided under this section. The term ``preference''means a Federal preference, unless the context indicates otherwise. (b) <T3>Applying the preferences.</T3> (1) Each PHA must include the Federalpreferences in its tenant selection standards. The PHA must apply the Federalpreferences in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of thissection, the equal opportunity and other requirements of andSection;andSection;882.407 and 882.514, and other applicable requirements (including limitationson the use of local residency requirements and preferences). (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, thePHA must establish a system for applying the Federal preferences that providesthat an applicant who qualifies for any of the Federal preferences is toreceive assistance under this part before any other applicant who is notso qualified, without regard to the other applicant's qualification forone or more preferences or priorities that are not provided by Federallaw, place on the waiting list, or the time of submission of an applicationfor a Certificate. (ii) The PHA's system for applying the Federal preferences may providefor circumstances in which applicants who do not qualify for a Federalpreference are admitted to a project assisted under this subpart beforeother applicants who are so qualified. Not more than 10 percent of theapplicants who are initially admitted to such a project in any one-yearperiod (or such shorter period selected by the PHA before the beginningof its first full year under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)) may be applicantsreferred to in the preceding sentence.             (iii) In applying the preferences under this paragraph (b)(2), the PHAmay determine the relative weight to be accorded the Federal preferences,through means such as:(A) Applying non-Federal preferences or priorities as a way of rankingapplicants who qualify for a Federal preference (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that applicants who qualify for a Federal preferenceand a local residency preference take precedence over non-resident Federalpreferenceholders; or provide that applicants whose rents were increasedbeyond 50 percent of their incomes after completion of Rental Rehabilitationactivities are ranked higher than those who meet the rent burden standardbecause of other reasons);(B) Aggregating the Federal preferences (<T3>i.e., </T3>two Federal preferences outweigh one and three outweightwo);(C) Ranking the Federal preferences (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that that an applicant living in substandard housinghas greater need for housing than (and, therefore, would be consideredfor assistance before) an applicant paying more than 50 percent of incomefor rent); or(D) Ranking the Federal preferences' definitional element (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that those living in housing that is dilapidatedor has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of governmenthave a greater need for housing than, and take precedence over, those whosehousing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub orshower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family).(3) Any selection preferences or priorities under this section or otherwisethat are used by a PHA must be established and administered in a mannerthat is not incompatible with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. 2000d; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.3601-19; Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing, 27 FR 11527(1962), <T3>as amended, </T3>46 FR 1253 (1980); Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101-07; or HUD's regulations and requirements issued under these authorities.Such preferences and priorities must also be consistent with HUD's affirmativefair housing objectives.(4) The PHA may establish selection preferences for applicant living inthe area where the PHA determines that it is not legally barred from enteringinto Contracts. However, preferences may not be based upon the length oftime the applicant has resided in the jurisdiction. Applicants who areworking or who have been notified that they are hired to work in the jurisdictionmust be treated as residents of the jurisdiction.(c) <T3>Qualifying for a Federal preference. </T3>(1) An applicant qualifiesfor a Federal preference if:(i) The applicant has been involuntarily displaced and is not living instandard, permanent replacement housing or, within no more than six monthsfrom the date of certification under paragraph (c)(2) of this section orverification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (as appropriate), theapplicant will be involuntarily displaced;(ii) The applicant is living in substandard housing; or(iii) The applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income forrent.(2) Applicants may claim qualification for a Federal preference when theyapply for assistance under this subpart (or thereafter until they are offeredassistance) by certifying to the PHA that they qualify for preferred statusunder paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The PHA must accept this certification,unless it verifies that the applicant is not qualified for preferred status.(3) Before selecting an applicant for participation, the PHA must requirethe applicant to provide verification that he or she qualifies for Federalpreference under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by virtue of the applicant'scurrent status. The applicant's current status must be determined withoutregard to whether there has been a change in the applicant's qualificationfor a Federal preference between the certification under paragraph (c)(2)of this section and the PHA's selection of the applicant for participation,including a change from one Federal preference category to another).(4) If an applicant's qualification for a Federal preference under paragraph(c)(1) of this section has once been verified, the PHA need not requirethe applicant to verify such qualification again, unless, as determinedby the PHA, such a long time has elapsed since verification as to makereverification desirable, or the PHA has reasonable grounds to believethat the applicant no longer qualifies for Federal preference.(5) For purposes of this paragraph (c), ``standard, permanent replacementhousing'' is housing_(i) That is decent, safe, and sanitary;(ii) That is adequate for the family size; and(iii) that the family is occupying pursuant to a lease or occupancy agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such housing does not include transient facilities, such as motels,hotels, or temporary shelters for victims of domestic violence or homelessfamilies, and in the case of domestic violence referred to in paragraph(d)(2) of this section, does not include the housing unit in which theapplicant and the applicant's spouse or other member of the household whoengages in such violence live.(6) An applicant may not qualify for a Federal preference under paragraph(c)(1)(iii) of this section if the applicant is paying more than 50 percentof family income to rent a unit because the applicant's housing assistanceunder the United States Housing Act of 1937 or section 101 of the Housingand Urban Development Act of 1965 with respect to that unit has been terminatedas a result of his or her refusal to comply with applicable program policiesand procedures with respect to the occupancy of underoccupied and overcrowdedunits.

(1) In selecting applicants for admission to its projects,each IHA must give preference to applicants who are otherwise eligiblefor assistance and who, at the time they are seeking housing assistance,are involuntarily displaced, living in substandard housing, or paying morethan 50 percent of family income for rent. (2)(i) The IHA must inform all applicants for assistance of the availabilityof the Federal preferences, and must give all applicants an opportunityto show that they qualify for a preference. For purposes of this paragraph(a)(2)(i), applicants include families on any waiting list for assistancemaintained by the IHA when this section is implemented or thereafter. (ii) If the IHA determines that the notification to all applicants on awaiting list required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is impracticablebecause of the length of the list, the IHA may provide this notificationto fewer than all applicants on the list at any given time. The IHA must,however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given timethat, on the basis of the IHA's determination of the number of applicantson the waiting list who already claim a Federal preference, and the anticipatednumber of project admissions: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify fora Federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the IHA's framework for applyingthe preferences under paragraph (b) and the preferences claimed by thosealready on the waiting list, any applicant who has not been so notifiedwould receive assistance before those who have received notification. (3) An IHA must apply the definitions of ``standard, permanent replacementhousing''; ``involuntary displacement''; ``substandard housing'' and ``homelessfamily''; ``family income''; and ``rent'' set forth in paragraphs (c)(5),(d), (f), (h), and (i), respectively, of this section, unless the IHA submitsalternative definitions for HUD's review and approval. An IHA may applythe verification procedures found in paragraphs (e), (g), and (j) of thissection, or it may, in its own discretion and without HUD approval, adoptverification procedures of its own. (4) For purposes of this section, the term ``Federal preference'' meansa tenant selection preference provided under this section. The term ``preference''means a Federal preference, unless the context indicates otherwise. (b)<T3> Applying the Federal preferences</T3>. (1) Each IHA must include theFederal preferences in its tenant selection policies and procedures. TheIHA must apply the Federal preferences in a manner that is consistent withthe provisions of this section, and other applicable requirements.(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, theIHA must establish a system for applying the Federal preferences that providesthan an applicant who qualifies for any of the Federal preferences is toreceive assistance before any other applicant who is not so qualified withoutregard to the other applicant's qualification for one or more preferencesor priorities that are not provided by Federal law, place on the waitinglist, or the time of submission of an application for assistance.(ii) The IHA's system for applying the Federal preferences may providefor circumstances in which applicants who do not qualify for a Federalpreference receive assistance before other applicants who are so qualified.Not more than 10 percent of the applicants who initially receive assistancein any one-year period (or such shorter period selected by the IPH beforethe beginning of its first full year under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) maybe applicants referred to in the preceding sentence.(iii) In applying the preferences under this paragraph (b)(2), the IHAmay determine the relative weight to be accorded the Federal preferences,through means such as:(A) Applying non-Federal preferences or priorities (such as local residencypreferences) as a way of ranking applicants who qualify (or claim qualification)for a Federal preference;(B) Aggregating the Federal preferences (<T3>i.e., </T3>two Federal preferences outweigh one and three outweightwo);(C) Ranking the Federal preferences (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that an applicant living in substandard housinghas greater need for housing than (and, therefore, would be consideredfor assistance before) an applicant paying more than 50 percent of incomefor rent); or (D) Ranking the Federal preferences' definitional elements (<T3>e.g., </T3>provide that those living in housing that is dilapidatedor has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of governmenthave a greater need for housing than, and take precedence over, those whosehousing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub orshower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family).(3) To the extent that HUD has determined that Title VI of the Civil RightsAct of 1964 and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 apply to a tribalgovernment, any selection preferences or priorities used by an IHA withinsuch a tribe's jurisdiction must be established and administered in a mannerthat is consistent with HUD's affirmative fair housing objectives and thatis not incompatible with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000d; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3601-19; ExecutiveOrder 11063 on Equal Opportunity in Housing, 27 FR 11527 (1962), <T3>as amended, </T3>46 FR 1253 (1980); Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101-07; or HUD's regulations and requirements issued under these authorities.(4) The IHA must submit to HUD any selection preference system that usesa local residency preference, for review for consistency with the requirementsof paragraph (b)(3) of this section, but HUD approval is not required beforethe IHA may implement the system.(c) <T3>Qualifying for a Federal preference. </T3>(1) An applicant qualifiesfor a Federal preference if_(i) The applicant has been involuntarily displaced and is not living instandard, permanent replacement housing, or within no more than six monthsfrom the date of certification under paragraph (c)(2) of this section orverification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (as appropriate), theapplicant will be involuntarily displaced;(ii) The applicant is living in substandard housing; or(iii) The applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income forrent.(2) Applicants may claim qualification for a Federal preference when theyapply for admission to a project (or thereafter until they are offereda unit in the project) by certifying to the IHA that they qualify for apreference under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. An IHA must accept thiscertification, unless the IHA verifies that the applicant is not qualifiedfor a Federal preference.(3) Before an applicant is admitted to a project on the basis of a Federalpreference, the IHA must require the applicant to provide verificationthat he or she qualifies for a Federal preference under paragraph (c)(1)of this section by virtue of the applicant's current status. The applicant'scurrent status must be determined without regard to whether there has beena change in the applicant's qualification for a preference between thecertification under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and admission to aproject, including a change from one Federal preference category to another.(4) If an applicant's qualification for a Federal preference under paragraph(c)(1) of this section has once been verified, an IHA need not requirethe applicant to verify such qualification again, unless, as determinedby the IHA, such a long time has elapsed since verification as to makereverification desirable, or the IHA has reasonable grounds to believethat the applicant no longer qualifies for a Federal preference.(5) For purposes of this paragraph (c), ``standard, permanent replacementhousing'' is housing_(i) That is decent, safe, and sanitary;(ii) That is adequate for the family size;

The PHA must,however, have notified a sufficient number of applicants at any given timethat, on the basis of the PHA's determination of the number of applicantson the waiting list who already claim a Federal preference, and the anticipatednumber of project admissions: (A) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify fora Federal preference; and (B) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's framework for applyingthe preferences under paragraph (b) and the preferences claimed by thosealready on the waiting list, any applicant who has not been so notifiedwould receive assistance before those who have received notification. (3) The PHA must apply the definitions of ``standard, permanent replacementhousing''; ``involuntary displacement''; ``substandard housing'' and ``homelessfamily''; ``family income''; and ``rent'' set forth in paragraphs (c)(5),(d), (f), (h), and (i), respectively, of this section, unless the PHA submitsalternative definitions of HUD's review and approval. The PHA may applythe verification procedures found in paragraphs (e), (g), and (j) of thissection or it may, in its own discretion and without HUD approval, adoptverification procedures of its own, as provided in andSection; 960.206.

(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, thePHA must establish a system for applying the Federal preferences that providesthat an applicant who qualifies for any of the Federal preferences is toreceive assistance before any other applicant who is not so qualified withoutregard to the other applicant's qualification for one or more preferencesor priorities that are not provided by Federal law, place on the waitinglist, or the time of submission of an application for assistance. (ii) The PHA's system for applying the Federal preferences may providefor circumstances in which applicants who do not qualify for a Federalpreference are provided assistance before other applicants who are so qualified.Not more than 10 percent of the applicants who initially receive assistancein any one-year period (or such shorter period selected by the PHA beforethe beginning of its first full year under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)) maybe applicants referred to in the preceding sentence. (iii) In applying the preferences under this paragraph (b)(2), the PHAmay determine the relative weight to be accorded the Federal preferences,through means such as: (A) Applying non-Federal preferences or priorities (such as local residencypreferences) as a way of ranking applicants who qualify (or claim qualification)for a Federal preference; (B) Aggregating the Federal preferences (<T3>i.e., </T3>two Federal preferences outweigh one and three outweightwo);(C) Ranking the Federal preferences (<T3>e.g.,</T3> provide that an applicant living in substandard housinghas greater need for housing than (and, therefore, would be consideredfor assistance before) an applicant paying more than 50 percent of incomefor rent); or (D) Ranking the Federal preferences' definitional elements <T3>(e.g.,</T3> provide that those living in housing that is dilapidatedor has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of governmenthave a greater need for housing than, and take precedence over, those whosehousing is substandard only because it does not have a usable bathtub orshower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the family).(3) Any selection preferences or priorities used by a PHA must be establishedand administered in a manner that is consistent with HUD's affirmativefair housing objectives and that is not incompatible with Title VI of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d; Title VIII of the Civil RightsAct of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3601-19; Executive Order 11063 on Equal Opportunityin Housing, 27 FR 11527 (1962), <T3>as amended,</T3> 46 FR 1253 (1980); Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101-07, or HUD's regulations and requirements issued under these authorities.(4) The PHA must submit to HUD any selection preference system that usesa local residency preference, for review for consistency with the requirementsof paragraph (b)(3) of this section, but HUD approval is not required beforethe PHA may implement the system.(c) <T3>Qualifying for a Federal preference.</T3> (1) An applicant qualifiesfor a Federal preference if_(i) The applicant has been involuntarily displaced and is not living instandard, permanent replacement housing, or, within no more than six monthsfrom the date of certification under paragraph (c)(2) of this section orverification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (as appropriate), theapplicant will be involuntarily displaced;(ii) The applicant is living in substandard housing; or (iii) The applicant is paying more than 50 percent of family income forrent. (2) Applicants may claim qualification for a Federal preference when theyapply for admission to a project (or thereafter until they are offereda unit in a project) by certifying to the PHA that they qualify for a preferenceunder paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A PHA must accept this certificationunless the PHA verifies that the applicant is not qualified for a Federalpreference.(3) Before executing a lease with an applicant who has been offered a uniton the basis of a Federal preference, the PHA must require the applicantto provide verification that he or she qualifies for a Federal preferenceunder paragraph (c)(1) of this section by virtue of the applicant's currentstatus. The applicant's current status must be determined without regardto whether there has been a change in the applicant's qualification fora preference between the certification under paragraph (c)(2) of this sectionand execution of an occupancy agreement, including a change from one Federalpreference category to another.(4) If an applicant's qualification for a Federal preference under paragraph(c)(1) of this section has once been verified, a PHA need not require theapplicant to verify such qualification again, unless, as determined bythe PHA, such a long time has elapsed since verification as to make reverificationdesirable, or the PHA has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicantno longer qualifies for a Federal preference.(5) For purposes of this paragraph (c), ``standard, permanent replacementhousing'' is housing_(i) That is decent, safe, and sanitary;
