About 30 percent of the fruit and vegetables eaten by Americansare imported.   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that grape imports fromChile grew to about 260,000 tons in 1988 from 213,000 in 1987.   Just 10 years ago, in 1979, only 33,000 tons of Chilean grapeswere imported, the department said.   Removal of Chilean grapes and other fruit from American foodstores following discovery of two grapes bearing traces of cyanideis bound to be felt in the food industry but the extent of damage ishard to determine, said John McClung of the United Fruit andVegetable Association, a trade group.   ``We don't know how long this is going to go on,' McClung said.``It's too soon to tell the economic impact, but the potential isconsiderable, both in Chile and the United States.''   McClung said Americans annually import about 30 percent of thefruit and vegetables they consume, most of it in the form of freshproduce, such as bananas, grapes, apples and tomatoes.   ``Chile is the big supplier of fruit,'' McClung said. ``Invegetables, it's mainly Mexico.''   The Agriculture Department says U.S. fresh fruit imports alonereached almost 3.62 million metric tons in 1987, up about 2 percentfrom 3.56 million tons in 1986. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.   Bananas made up 81 percent of the 1987 fresh fruit imports,followed by grapes with 6.9 percent and apples with 3.7 percent.   The bananas came mostly from Ecuador, Colombia and the so-calledCaribbean Basin Initiative countries of Honduras, Costa Rica,Panama, Guatemala and the Bahamas. Grapes mostly were from Chile,and apples from Canada, Chile and New Zealand.   A 1983 law gave 27 countries in the Caribbean Basin duty freeaccess to U.S. markets for 12 years.   Chile has passed South Africa, Australia and Argentina to becomethe leading supplier of fresh fruit to North America and Europeduring the Northern Hemisphere's winter months.   About 75 percent of Chile's grapes are shipped to the UnitedStates, and a large percentage of its apples go to Europe. But someapples also go to the United States where they compete with thedomestic crop. Pears are another major Chilean item for the U.S.market, according to USDA analysts.   ``Chile has a climate somewhat like ours,'' McClung said in aninterview. ``It's not a tropical climate, so they're able to producestone fruit like peaches, nectarines, plums, that kind of fruit. Andthose are popular in this country.''   McClung said the trade was stunned by what happened to theChilean grapes and was at a loss to speculate on what may happennext.   ``Honestly, I'm unaware of anything like this from any place,ever,'' he said. ``But I suppose if someone is intent on a criminalor terrorist act regarding the tainting of produce, it can probablybe accomplished.''   At the USDA, analyst Ben W. Huang of the department's EconomicResearch Service said it was too early to say what impact theincident may have on U.S. food supplies.   John J. VanSickle of the University of Florida said in a reportjust issued by the USDA that Florida vegetable growers are concernedabout competition from the Caribbean Initiative countries.   ``Florida and Mexico have long battled for supremacy in thewinter fresh vegetable industry,'' he said.   VanSickle said Florida's share of the winter vegetable market hasgrown only in tomatoes, rising to 51.9 percent of U.S. consumptionin 1986-87 from 42.4 percent in 1975-76.   ``Florida's share of the eggplant market remained fairly stable,while the share of all other commodities fell, with bell peppers,cucumbers, beans and squash each falling between 10 percent and 19.8percent,'' he said.   Even so, Florida's actual production of these vegetables hasincreased, with the exception of beans, VanSickle said. The declinein the shares of the U.S. market shows the tremendous growth thathas taken place in consumption.   Another USDA report said the 1988 drought did not affect consumerprices of fresh vegetables this winter, noting that most are grownunder irrigation in Florida or California.   ``Many winter fresh tomatoes, peppers, green beans, cucumbers,squash and eggplant are imported from Mexico,'' the report said.   But U.S. apple production dropped 17 percent last year, partlybecause of the drought, and retail prices are up this winter, thereport said. Production in Washington, the leading apple state, fell26 percent from 1987.   ``Winter supplies of fresh soft fruits, such as peaches, grapes,apricots, plums and nectarines are imported from Southern Hemispherecountries, mostly Chile,'' the report noted.</TEXT></DOC>
