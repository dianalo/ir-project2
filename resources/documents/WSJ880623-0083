Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD RFD FOD </IN><G> FDA </G><TEXT>   A small number of supermarkets have unleashed a big controversy by claiming their Nature's bounty is &quot;safer&quot; than the competition's.    To quell consumers' fears about food safety, these retailers recently turned to NutriClean, a private testing laboratory that provides a sort of Good Housekeeping seal of approval for fruits and vegetables. When NutriClean stamps its name in day-glo orange letters on a crate of cherry tomatoes, avocados or peaches, retailers get to boast that their commercial produce contains little, if any, pesticides.    &quot;The consumer wants the supermarket to have the courage to stand up and say, 'all our products are safe enough for you not to have to worry,'&quot; says Stan Rhodes, NutriClean's president and owner, and a research chemist by training. &quot;We are trying to bring reasonable quality-control standards to an industry that really needs it.&quot;    But the Oakland, Calif.-based lab's &quot;certification&quot; process is also under attack. Critics view it as a costly gimmick born of stiff supermarket competition and relatively stable food prices. They say private certification adds nothing to the healthfulness of food. And they worry that supermarkets that promote private testing are feeding the public's unfounded fears that typical store-bought produce is dangerous.    &quot;There's no question that private testing is opportunism at its worst,&quot; says Robert Wunderle, a spokesman for Supermarkets General Corp., which owns the Pathmark chain. &quot;It's destructive in terms of public confidence in the food supply to create a food-anxiety issue purely for the benefit of marketing.&quot;    NutriClean currently plys its trade to about six retailers. Although they aren't among the supermarket industry's best-known names, that may change soon. Stop andamp; Shop Cos., a 113-store chain in Braintree, Mass., says it is considering using NutriClean. And Mr. Rhodes says several other big regional retailers are also examining the program.    Many supermarket analysts and executives think that private testing is just starting to take off -- and that widespread use is inevitable. Once a few of the leading supermarkets adopt private testing, they say, competitive pressures may make it hard for others to resist.    &quot;The safety of fresh produce is a big controversy,&quot; says Mona Doyle, president of the Consumer Network, a consumer-research firm in Philadelphia. &quot;If supermarkets can just say 'our stuff is safe,' consumers will flock to it.&quot;    NutriClean, which was founded in 1984 to do quality testing for the health-food industry, shifted its focus to growers and supermarkets last year. It now contracts annually with about 150 growers, who guarantee their produce will meet the Environmental Protection Agency's &quot;negligible risk standards.&quot; That means using pesticides at levels that cause less than one cancer per million people. NutriClean samples produce from every one of the growers' fields, for which growers pay $1,200 to $3,000 per field per crop.    The Food and Drug Administration, by contrast, randomly tests about 1% of produce after it leaves growers' fields. It doesn't have routine dealings with growers. And its standards for pesticide levels are considerably less stringent than the &quot;negligible risk&quot; requirement. Some states supplement such random testing with their own sampling programs.    NutriClean also contracts with retailers to randomly test their produce in stores or warehouses. The testing looks for evidence of 28 pesticides that the FDA finds too difficult to routinely scan for -- captan and benomyl, for instance. The information is circulated among NutriClean's clients to help them keep tabs on the best and worst growers. The retailers foot this bill, which typically runs $3,000 to $5,000 a week.    &quot;Our long-term objective is to learn which growers and packers consistently outperform the government's current pesticide-residue standards so that we can direct more of our produce purchases toward those quality conscious suppliers,&quot; explains Robert Bolley, a spokesman for Portland-based Fred Meyer Inc., which just signed on with the private lab.    Adds Michael Julian, executive vice president of Norfolk, Va.-based Farm Fresh Inc., another new NutriClean recruit: &quot;We aren't of the opinion that it isn't healthy to eat the produce in stores now, but we think it can be healthier.&quot;    Even doomsayers agree the U.S. food supply is the safest in the world. Still, some advocates of private testing see an opportunity to expand the market for fruits and vegetables that use less pesticides than the government requires. Others believe it can help stem an erosion of consumer confidence in the safety of the U.S. food system.    The Food Marketing Institute, for instance, says that 75% of all surveyed shoppers consider residues such as pesticides and herbicides to be &quot;a serious hazard.&quot;    And last year, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report saying that nine popular fruits and vegetables, including potatoes, tomatoes, oranges and apples, may contain levels of pesticide residues that can cause tumors in animals -- and yet still meet government requirements.    &quot;What got us into this initially was that we began to realize our customers were getting a lot of negative information about the safety of produce,&quot; explains Charles Collings, president of Raley's, a West Sacramento, Calif.-based chain. To make sure such fears are unfounded, Raley's has paid NutriClean $5,000 a week for almost a year. Thanks to Raley's heavy advertising of produce such as &quot;Apples without Alar,&quot; consumer response has been &quot;outstanding,&quot; adds Mr. Collings.    The big question among critics is whether pesticide-free food is a response to overblown fears. &quot;The argument goes that pesticide residues are bad and they shouldn't be there,&quot; says FDA Commissioner Frank Young. But, he adds, &quot;there is no evidence of what the harm is.&quot;    Counters Mr. Rhodes: &quot;The government refuses to acknowledge the cumulative or synergistic effect of these pesticides. They look at each pesticide as if there were no other pesticides in a consumer's universe.&quot;    Of all the produce NutriClean has screened at the retail level, only 1% violate the government's standards for cancercausing pesticides. (Violations are reported to the government.) But 20% of the produce, Mr. Rhodes contends, bears &quot;significant risks&quot; from a health, not legal, standpoint.    For their part, many major retailers insist the hoopla over NutriClean has more to do with sales than safety. They say that objectivity can be lost when the tester is being paid by the tested, and that supermarkets don't have the expertise to judge either the quality of tests or the results. Instead, they add, retailers should be working with the government to improve the existing system.    &quot;This could cause an erosion of credibility in the authorities charged with (testing) responsibility,&quot; says John Shepherd, a spokesman for Safeway Stores Inc. &quot;Our feeling is that if there's a problem with the government's system, it should be corrected, not circumvented with this flimflam approach.&quot;    The biggest fear among retailers is that consumers will think that produce without certification is dangerous. &quot;We are alarmed by the implication that one company's produce is safer than another's,&quot; says Paul Bernish, a spokesman for Kroger Co. In fact, some supermarkets, which have NutriClean retailers as competitors, have had to do some fast talking. To counter Raley's advertising blitz, Bel Air Markets earlier this year took out newspaper ads inviting customers to inspect the California state laboratory that tests its produce. Some 80 shoppers took the tour.    Meanwhile, the idea of private testing has divided growers, too. Bruce Obbink, president of the California Table Grape Commission, a trade association, doesn't think private scientists should be allowed to devise safety standards, and then have those standards imposed on everybody.    Says Mr. Obbink: &quot;At some point in time, federal regulators will have to look at this and ask, 'Are we doing the testing or are we having vigilantes do it?'&quot;    ---                       Fear of Food   When consumers were asked how much they are concerned about the following items in food, they said: Residues, such as pesticides and herbicides Serious health hazard                             75% Somewhat of a health hazard                       20% Not a hazard                                       4% Not sure                                           2% Antibiotics and hormones in poultry/livestock Serious health hazard                             61% Somewhat of a health hazard                       28% Not a hazard                                       6% Not sure                                           5% Fats Serious health hazard                             61% Somewhat of a health hazard                       35% Not a hazard                                       4% Not sure                                           1% Cholesterol Serious health hazard                             59% Somewhat of a health hazard                       35% Not a hazard                                       4% Not sure                                           1% Salt Serious health hazard                             42% Somewhat of a health hazard                       49% Not a hazard                                       8% Not sure                                           1% Irradiation Serious health hazard                             36% Somewhat of a health hazard                       29% Not a hazard                                      10% Not sure                                          24% Nitrites Serious health hazard                             44% Somewhat of a health hazard                       38% Not a hazard                                       6% Not sure                                          12% Additives and preservatives Serious health hazard                             29% Somewhat of a health hazard                       61% Not a hazard                                       7% Not sure                                           3% Sugar Serious health hazard                             28% Somewhat of a health hazard                       60% Not a hazard                                      12% Not sure                                           1% Artificial coloring Serious health hazard                             21% Somewhat of a health hazard                       50% Not a hazard                                      25% Not sure                                           4%   NOTE: Total percentages vary because of rounding.
