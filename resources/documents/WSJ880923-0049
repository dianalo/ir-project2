The financial services concern said there are currently 1,387,539 shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding. Trustcorp said the redemption plan gives the preferred shareholders the option of receiving 1.21 shares of common stock for each preferred share, or of receiving $26.50 in cash for each preferred share.    Preferred shareholders may redeem their shares through Merrill Lynch Inc., which has underwritten the redemption.    Trustcorp said the redemption, which has a market value of about $44.1 million, won't affect its earnings for 1988. In fact, Trustcorp now expects that it will report higher profit this year than the more than $51 million analysts had previously projected. The earlier forecasts were based partly on the potentially dilutive effect of Trustcorp's proposed acquisition of Summcorp, a Ft. Wayne, Ind., bank holding company. The two companies broke off talks in July, however. In 1987, Trustcorp reported net income of $51 million, or $3.19 a share.    Trustcorp issued the preferred stock in 1982 in its acquisition of First Buckeye Bank, of Mansfield. The announcement of the redemption came after the close of trading yesterday.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Trustcorp stock closed at $26.375, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
