But Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose amore modest 2.19, to 385.78. Declines among over-the-countertechnology stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to515.68, down 1.03.   Analysts said stock prices rebounded as expected from thesharp sell-off that followed the Federal Reserve'sinterest-rate cut Friday. But buying was concentrated in someof the Dow Jones industrial stocks: International BusinessMachines climbed 3/4 to 103 5/8; General Electric soared 17/8 to 69 3/4; Exxon was up 1 1/4 to 59 5/8; Du Pont gained 11/8 to 46 3/8; and Procter andamp; Gamble rose 1 1/4 to 84.   &quot;It was a smattering of things that helped the Dow, butbeyond that the market deserves to be up a little bit afterthe `buy on the rumors, sell on the news,' selloff we hadFriday,&quot; said Peter Canelo, chief market strategist at CountyNatWest. &quot;As long as bond yields continue to come down,they'll take some of the pressure off the stock market.&quot;   &quot;I'm a less-than-enthusiastic bull at this point,&quot; hesaid. Despite lower interest rates, the economy remainssluggish and the outlook for corporate profits is dim. Hesaid the Fed might consider cutting rates again if theeconomy doesn't perk up.   If the Dow Jones industrials &quot;dipped to the low 2900s, I'dprobably be a buyer,&quot; Mr. Canelo said, and if they &quot;rose tothe low 3100s, I'd be a seller.&quot;   Lower U.S. interest rates hurt the dollar. &quot;This is thecontinuation of the trend that was put in place last week,&quot;said Richard Witten, partner in charge of currency sales atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Money is cheap and probably gettingcheaper.&quot;   The U.S. currency has fallen nearly 4% during the past sixtrading days and is down nearly 9% from highs reached Aug. 19at the time of the coup attempt in the Soviet Union. Giventhat interest rates in other countries are much higher thanthose in the U.S., some traders said they were surprised thedollar hadn't fallen further.   In the short run, Mr. Witten predicted the dollar wouldtrade possibly as low as 1.63 marks and in the range of 130to 132 yen.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices climbed in active trading. Volume totaledalmost 172 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange,where 912 issues advanced and 704 fell.                                                                                                          Bond prices rose modestly. The Treasury's benchmark30-year bond gained 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000face amount. The yield on the issue fell to 7.92%.                                                                                                          The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currencywas quoted at 1.6725 marks and 133.55 yen, compared with1.6892 marks and 134.90 yen Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
