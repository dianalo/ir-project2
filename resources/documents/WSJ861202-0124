The money was withdrawn from Haiti's National Defense Fund and deposited two days later in account No. 103-6020-748 at Irving Trust in New York. The beneficiary was Michele Duvalier, the wife of Haiti's Jean-Claude Duvalier, then Haiti's president for life.    Such routine transfers of funds typified the way the Duvaliers looted their desperately poor country's treasury for much of the 15-year Duvalier reign, says Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan, the New York law firm hired by Haiti's government in attempts to recover the assets.    Despots throughout history -- most recently the shah of Iran and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines -- commonly appropriated public money for private purposes. But for the blatant method used, if not the magnitude, the Duvalier case has few equals.    &quot;It appears that they treated Haiti and its public funds as if they were their private, personal property,&quot; says Curtis Mechling, the senior Stroock partner in the case.    Mr. Duvalier, who had been in power since the 1971 death of his father, Francois &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier, fled Haiti amid widespread protests in February and is living in exile with his wife and their four children on the French Riviera. The Duvaliers deny any wrongdoing, saying that it was normal for funds to flow through the palace in Haiti and that the money went for proper and charitable causes.    In gathering evidence for a civil-court case in France and related actions in the U.S. and Switzerland, Stroock is coordinating a legal assault that reaches from Port-au-Prince to Miami, New York, Geneva and the Riviera. It has traced $105 million that it says was siphoned out of government funds and into accounts of the Duvaliers and their associates. Stroock lawyers and investigators have pored over canceled checks and palace records and tracked down sources from a former Central Bank clerk to the former captain of the Duvalier yacht.    As a result of the efforts, roughly $10 million has been tied up by U.S. and French courts. But recovering money is proving far more difficult. Thus far, only $25,000 -- from the sale of a speedboat found in Florida -- has been recovered. Thorny obstacles remain in every jurisdiction.    Haiti has filed a criminal complaint against members of the old regime, and Stroock has won orders in various U.S. courts empowering it to subpoena evidence for the Haitian investigation. However, the Duvaliers are beyond the reach of courts in Haiti and the U.S.    They do face the civil trial in March in Grasse, France, near their home, on broad charges of embezzling from the Haitian government. But most of the Duvaliers' money is thought to be stashed in Switzerland. And while the Swiss have ordered a freeze of the Duvaliers' accounts, they haven't said how much is in them or what they will do with them.    &quot;It's a very difficult case,&quot; says Henri Torrione, an attorney for Haiti in Switzerland. &quot;The crimes were committed in Haiti, but the money and the information are in other countries.&quot;    Stroock's strategy is to prove that assets were stolen and to recover as much as possible in specific suits. Also, Mr. Mechling says, &quot;If Haiti can obtain a judgment against Duvalier in France, we may be able to use it to recover assets in other countries. Our global strategy is to go after assets wherever they are.&quot;    Stroock, which previously had represented Haitian boat people and exiles, was hired last March. Jed Ringel, a 34-year-old associate, had handled immigration cases involving Haitians, but he had never been to Haiti and didn't speak French.    On the first of his 18 trips to the island, he discovered that people were reluctant to talk about the old regime, especially to foreigners.    The first break occurred when Mr. Ringel saw a Haitian newspaper that quoted Andre Brauplan, a Central Bank employee, on alleged Duvalier embezzlement. He persuaded Mr. Brauplan to map out a list of relevant bank employees. On the list was Madeline Savain, a clerk who had been in charge of handling the palace account. Miss Savain, who was living in Miami, was afraid to return to Haiti because of her association with the Duvaliers. But with some coaxing, she returned and guided Mr. Ringel through a maze of records at the Central Bank.    Miss Savain had a tiny office. &quot;She didn't even have her name on the door,&quot; Mr. Ringel says. But whenever the Duvaliers or their secretaries had called to make a transaction, Miss Savain filled out a form. &quot;And she kept every form.&quot;    The &quot;Savain Debit Log,&quot; as Stroock refers to her archives, is a sort of Rosetta stone of the Duvalier period. It documents hundreds of withdrawals from public funds that were authorized by the palace or by the &quot;President a Vie&quot; back to 1974.    An entry, dated May 21, 1974, is for $35,400 to &quot;Beechcraft Air.&quot; The log also shows $460,000 to United Aircraft in 1975, $101,000 to &quot;Automobile Ferrari&quot; in May 1980, and $300,000 to Denisson Marine last year. Spritzer andamp; Fuhrmann, a Curacao jeweler, is cited three times for a total of $365,000. The most frequent entry is to &quot;cash.&quot; Payments went to French fashion designers and to Antoine Philidor, the captain of the Duvalier yacht.    &quot;They spent on furniture, antiques, artwork, tapestries -- all the things you need to make a palace comfy,&quot; Mr. Mechling says. The amounts escalated around 1980, when the Duvaliers were married. Scores of withdrawals by Jean-Claude and Michele and by members of their families are recorded.    Unlike Mr. Marcos, whose fortune apparently derived from his control of Philippine industry, the Duvaliers drew out cash directly. &quot;They did it with a rage,&quot; says Haiti's minister of justice, Francois Latortue. &quot;Something extraordinary.&quot;    Jean Sambour, the Duvaliers' decorator and friend, received $17.8 million in the last three years, the log shows. There were 16 withdrawals for Charles Jean, the palace chauffeur, totaling $900,000. Three others, confidants of Mr. Duvalier, are entered in the log 200 times.    An affidavit given by a bank official refers to &quot;recent&quot; cash transfers of $6 million to the Duvaliers and large sums to former Duvalier ministers: $1.6 million to Jean-Marie Chanoine, $1.4 million to Roger Lafontant, $735,000 to Frantz Merceron and $270,000 to Stanley Theard.    &quot;You can see a pattern of transfers from government accounts to accounts controlled by the palace and then a day or two later of transfers out of the country,&quot; says Leslie Delatour, Haiti's finance minister.    Tracing the money is another matter. &quot;You have to divide the two things off,&quot; Mr. Ringel says. &quot;One is finding out how much money was stolen and documenting it. The other is finding out where it went.&quot;    Several times, Stroock has been frustratingly late. In the palace, Mr. Ringel found an address file with the notation: &quot;City Bk-Madison Ave 76th Street, Safety 685.&quot; The first lady, in fact, had a safe-deposit box at New York's Citibank. Stroock won an order freezing any contents of the box in May. But the box had been cleaned out several weeks earlier.    David Pollack, a Stroock attorney in Miami, found a house owned by Nicole, Jean-Claude's sister, in Dade County's deeds in May. The house, however, had been sold for $275,000 two months earlier, with the payment sent to Switzerland.    The U.S. Coast Guard tipped off Stroock about the Duvaliers' $2 million, 86-foot yacht, the Niki, in a Dania, Fla., boatyard. But the yacht had been sold by the Duvaliers last March.    The law firm had better luck in June, when a subpoena sweep of Miami banks turned up $1.2 million in two Barnett Bank accounts of Paul Samuel Jeremie, previously a colonel in the Duvalier army. Stroock provided a state judge in Miami with 32 &quot;debit advices&quot; from the Savain log authorizing payments to Mr. Jeremie, who currently is serving a sentence in Haiti for &quot;murder and cruelty.&quot; The accounts have been temporarily frozen, pending Stroock's plea for a permanent freeze and a trial.    Stroock also won an order in a New York state court freezing a $185,000 time deposit of Michele Duvalier at Irving Trust, after tracing the money to Haiti's national defense account.    The firm also has effectively tied up five apartments in New York and Miami, worth a total of about $4 million, which it found through electronic detecting and some tips from Haitian exiles.    &quot;We started with long-distance telephone records from the palace,&quot; says Daniel Karson, the managing director of Kroll Associates Inc., a New York investigative firm that has worked with Stroock. &quot;In one case, we saw a lot of calls to a number and did a reverse check with a data bank.&quot; The trail led to a $2.5 million condominium, owned by a Panama corporation, in New York's Trump Tower. &quot;Then we ran the corporate name and came up with the name of an American agent,&quot; Mr. Karson says. &quot;We already had a tip that he was associated with Duvalier, so that was like a confirmation.&quot; The address turned out to be that of Mr. Sambour, the decorator.    The law firm has also been going through 10 years of Haitian bank archives, looking for checks with suspect payees or large amounts. Many checks were written to &quot;Social Projects of the President&quot; and cashed by Mr. Duvalier.    In addition, Mr. Karson says, &quot;there are six-figure checks to companies with Swiss directors.&quot; And Stroock has found $1 million in down payments that the Duvaliers had spent on still-undelivered consumer goods. Retailers have agreed to return the money, Mr. Ringel says. &quot;They are big-ticket luxury items,&quot; he adds.    Thousands of checks were copied, brought to New York and entered in a computer. &quot;We can press a button and see all the transactions by beneficiary, by date, and so on,&quot; Mr. Ringel says. &quot;All of this will be marshaled most effectively for the trial in France.&quot;    The Duvaliers are preparing for the trial at their French villa, rented from Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, overlooking Cannes. They defend their actions as honest and consistent with the way government has traditionally worked in Haiti, where Mr. Duvalier and his father held power for 28 years.    In an interview on ABC's &quot;20/20,&quot; Mr. Duvalier said &quot;there was never any embezzlement. It is simply and purely a lie, it is slander. You must know that all heads of state of my country have always had certain funds at their disposal for implementing policy. It was a paternalistic kind of system.&quot; Mrs. Duvalier said money was spent wisely and charitably, on schools, hospitals and meals for children.    Sauveur Vaisse, the Duvaliers' lawyer, says he will defend them on essentially the same grounds. &quot;We shall argue before the different courts that there was never until the end of 1985 a real budget as we know in France or the U.S.,&quot; he says. &quot;There were no rules. There weren't any differences between personal and governmental funds.&quot; Even money spent abroad, he added, was expended &quot;in the interest of the Haitian state.&quot;    However, Mr. Duvalier has also hinted at a willingness to settle. In a July 3 letter to Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of the new government, he declared: &quot;Although I am obliged to defend myself against attacks, I am determined to make all the necessary sacrifices to permit a reconciliation.&quot; Mr. Latortue, the justice minister, says, &quot;I don't think there has been a response.&quot;    Haitians surely knew that Mr. Duvalier was living off more than his official salary of $3,750 a month. &quot;What shocks is the extravagance,&quot; says Bob Neree, a Port-au-Prince journalist for the New York-based Haiti Observateur. &quot;They exposed with a kind of arrogance their disregard for the misery&quot; of Haiti's poor.    Much of the money apparently went to the U.S. and from there to Europe. Based on Stroock's evidence, Swiss courts in April agreed to freeze the Duvalier accounts. However, recovering them will be tough. Mr. Torrione, who works for the Geneva firm of Lenz Schluep Briner andamp; de Coulon, says &quot;You have to establish that the money is a direct result of offenses committed in Haiti.&quot; Or, he says: &quot;if there is a judgment in France, we may be able to enforce it here.&quot;    Jacques Sales, Haiti's lawyer in France, says he seeks more than $100 million. By French law, Mr. Duvalier won't have to testify or submit to discovery proceedings. Mr. Sales says the case will ride on the evidence developed by Stroock and on establishing that the Duvaliers have large sums in Switzerland. The latter, he says, &quot;will prove that he didn't use the money for hospitals and schools.&quot;    However, during the two-month lapse between the flight of the Duvaliers and the freezing of their accounts in Switzerland, the Duvaliers may have transferred money out of the country. The trial in France thus could prove academic. &quot;We may be too late,&quot; says Mr. Sales, a Haitian-born French citizen. &quot;But we have great hopes, if only for history.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
