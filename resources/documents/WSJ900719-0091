Mario Cuomo prepares to campaign for a third term,and ponders a run for the White House in 1992, his role inNew York's fiscal deterioration is under increased scrutiny.   Earlier this year, while unexpectedly slow revenue growthwas forcing the governor's budget office to increase itsdeficit estimate by $2 billion, Mr. Cuomo called for adouble-digit rise in state spending. As a result, New Yorkers-- already the highest-taxed people in the country -- willpay an additional $1.8 billion in state taxes and fees thisyear, including $400 million in higher income taxes. Despitethe state's pledge to reform future fiscal operations,Moody's lowered its rating on the state's long-term debt.Only the bonds of Massachusetts and Louisiana are ratedlower.</LP><TEXT>   So far the governor has successfully side-steppedquestions about his fiscal competency. He insists that thestate's problems stem from the economic slowdown in theNortheast, and many New Yorkers accept this view. But NewYork state has incurred deficits for eight of the past 10years. During most of that period, the state's economyperformed better than the most Polyannish futurist would havedared to predict in 1980.   Population, after declining by 683,000 between 1970 and1980, rose 2.2% between 1980 and 1989. Real income reboundedfrom no growth to average annual increases of more than 3%since 1980. Although it lagged neighboring states, New Yorkgrew faster than the nation, with per-capita income risingfrom 8.1% above the national average in 1980 to 16.9% abovein 1989. There are 1.2 million more New Yorkers working todaythan when Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983, and the statejobless rate has been cut to below 5% from 8.6%.   Had state spending merely kept pace with personal income,Albany would be dispensing a multibillion-dollar surplustoday. But this opportunity was squandered: Spending rosefrom 14.7% of personal income in 1983 to 16% in 1988.   Paying for this profligacy is fairly painless whenpersonal income taxes, business taxes and taxes on realestate transfers automatically rise relative to personalincome. Comes an economic slowdown and the process isreversed -- last year business taxes fell 3.1% andreal-property gains taxes were off 28.6% even as personalincome continued to grow. But old spending habits die hard.The fiscal 1991 budget, hammered out after the longest, mostcontentious budget debate in state history, compromised on a7.5% spending increase. The governor had requested a 10.9%rise.   Assessing the true size or even the direction of statespending is not easy. The state's affairs are tangled in anetwork of trust accounts, special funds and off-budgetenterprises expressly designed to confuse outsiders. Thus thegovernor can claim to have &quot;cut&quot; school aid by $400 millionthis year simply by waiving the state's annual pensioncontribution to the teacher retirement fund. Similarly,revenues will be &quot;increased&quot; by selling a state officebuilding to the state-run Urban Development Corp.   These shenanigans are reminiscent of New York City beforethe financial community shut it out of the credit markets in1975. Ironically, part of the legacy of that crisis is thatNew York state now requires the city to balance its budget onthe basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Thefiscal discipline imposed by GAAP forced the city to lay offworkers and reduce essential services to close its budget gapthis year. In contrast, the state simply sold short-termnotes (a record $4.1 billion this spring) to cover itsshortfall, thereby avoiding unpleasant spending choicesduring this election year.   Is New York's deficit due to circumstances beyond itscontrol? Hardly. The state's payroll, for example, balloonedfrom $3 billion in 1983 to $6.9 billion in 1988, a 130%increase during a period when consumer prices rose 19%. In1988 New York had 158 full-time employees for every 10,000residents, compared with 107 in California, 124 in Texas, 114in Florida and 104 in Pennsylvania. Over-staffing is obvious:The newly established New York State Grace Commission mightexplore why the Highway Department employs more than twice asmany workers per lane mile as the national average, and whythere are only 1.5 inmates per corrections worker here vs.two per worker nationwide.   The big money -- more than 50% of state spending -- goesto education and social services. The Aid to Families withDependent Children grant has been increased four times in thepast six years, most recently a 15% rise that took effectJan. 1. It's politically untouchable. But why should thestate Department of Social Services, a $150 million agencythat does not issue a single welfare benefit check, beallowed a 22% increase in its operating budget this year?Medicaid costs three times more per recipient here than inCalifornia, yet Albany shows no inclination to try themarket-oriented reforms that have successfully controlledcosts in that state.   The highest per-pupil expenditure in the country has notprevented New York's average SAT scores from sinking belowthe national average. The school bureaucracy has flourished,however. According to Albert Shanker, president of theAmerican Federation of Teachers, there are more schooladministrators in New York than in all of Western Europe.   New York City (which receives 34% of state education aidand 60% of total state welfare allotments) is arguably inworse fiscal shape than the state. Although state money tobail out the city may be lacking, Albany's power to do so isnot.   The state has imposed rent control on certain New YorkCity buildings since World War II. Decontrolling high-rentapartments would increase city property taxes by more than$370 million each year, according to Peat Marwick. Acapital-gains tax cut would increase the value of New Yorkreal estate and breathe life into a securities industry thathas cut its New York City work force by 21,000 employees. Theprivatization of state assets, ranging from airports to theWorld Trade Center, could raise funds to restore the city'scrumbling infrastructure. Unfortunately, the politicalestablishment in both Albany and City Hall rejects thesepolicies.   Many New Yorkers are encouraged by the apparent end of thetax revolt in California. Few know that this flip-flop comesafter stringent spending limitations pushed that state'sspending down relative to personal income. (At one point Gov.George Deukmejian actually rebated $1.1 billion of excessrevenues to state residents.) More important, few New Yorkersknow that their own governor wields both a line-item veto anda broad impoundment authority -- powers for spending controlthat President Bush can only dream about. Gov. Hugh Careyused these weapons to reduce spending as a percentage ofpersonal income. It can be done again.   ---   Mr. Rubenstein, an adjunct fellow of the ManhattanInstitute, writes on economics for National Review.</TEXT></DOC>
