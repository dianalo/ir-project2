A spokeswoman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,which regulates 4,450 nationally chartered banks, said Tuesday thatthe agency's examiners will receive new guidelines within the nextseveral weeks requiring them to evaluate institutions' risk frommaking loans in leveraged buyouts, or LBOs.   ``We want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis ofexactly what the risks are,'' spokeswoman Lee Cross said.   The issue has taken on greater significance recently as anunprecedented wave of multibillion-dollar LBO proposals _ financedpartly by billions in bank loans _ swept over Wall Street.   Two weeks ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,whose agency regulates bank holding companies, told the SenateBanking Committee that he has warned banks making leveraged buyoutloans to consider borrowers' prospects ``in a range of economic andfinancial circumstances.''   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures commercial bank deposits, has said theproliferation of LBOs is increasing the risk to the financial system.   In a leveraged buyout, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s$20.6 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group borrowsheavily in order to purchase stock and take over the company.   The debt is repaid either with the acquired company's cash flowor with mopney raised by the sale of its assets.   The popularity of such deals and the resulting mushrooming ofdebt has raised concern about the ability of debt-burdened companiesto withstand an economic downturn.   Critics say most of the deals have been assembled since 1982,when the economy began expanding, and have not been tested by arecession.   If a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn, the value ofits stock falls. However, a highly leveraged company could be forcedinto bankruptcy if a bad economy makes it unable to meet its debtpayments.   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company whichmonitors large bank loans to corporations, banks have lent $70billion to highly-leveraged transactions since mid-1987. LBO andtakeover lending comprised 59 percent of the banks big corporateloans in the July-September quarter.   Ms. Cross said the comptroller's office began revising its LBOguidelines after surveying the practices of 11 large money centerbanks and five regional institutions in late spring and early summer.   ``We found that so far the banks that have been involved seem tohave taken a pretty reasonable approach. ...No bank wasperfect...but we did not see any really substantial problems,'' Ms.Cross said.   But, she said, ``Our concern now is going forward as competitionin this area heats up.'' She said banks with less experience in LBOsare likely to enter the lucrative area.   Also, so far most LBOs have been put together for large,well-established companies in stable industries. In the future, moreLBOs may be undertaken of riskier companies.   The new comptroller's guidelines will not impose limits on LBOlending, but will direct examiners to determine if a bank's policiesinclude limits on LBO lending as a whole and limits for singledeals, Ms. Cross said.   She said examiners also will be checking to see if banks areestablishing adequate reserves against expected losses and whetherthey have systems in place to properly track the performance of theloans.   One problem in developing the guidelines is that banks havewidely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveragedlending, she said.   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is working on a definitionof highly leveraged debt, which will be ready in several months,said spokesman Peter Bakstansky.</TEXT></DOC>
