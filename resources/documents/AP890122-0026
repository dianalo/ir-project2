Some problems, particularly the federal budget deficit, aremanifestly worse than they were when Reagan inherited them fromJimmy Carter during the presidential turnover eight years earlier.   AIDS was unheard of in 1981, although the deadly sexuallytransmitted virus was already spreading through its victims. Todate, it has claimed the lives of more than 46,000 Americans, and nocure is in sight.   The national debt was $930 billion when Reagan moved into theOval Office. Now, George Bush has inherited a debt that has soaredpast $2.6 trillion and is growing at the rate of $155 billion a year.   The trade deficit has abated from a peak of $170 billion in 1987,but the United States still imports $11 billion more than it exportseach month.   The spread of homelessness across urban America and into itssuburbs has been a nagging reminder that the five-plus years ofunbroken economic growth have also left some Americans behind.   On the health front, 37 million Americans now have no healthinsurance, up from 30 million or fewer at the end of the 1970s. Mostare in working class families not poor enough to qualify forMedicaid, with their breadwinners in low-paying jobs that offer fewfringe benefits like health insurance.   Health care costs were soaring much faster than the general rateof inflation when Reagan took office, and they are still hurtlingforward.   Efforts by the government's Medicare and Medicaid programs aswell as private insurers such as Blue Cross to demand moreefficiency from hospitals and physicians had mixed results.   The nation pays more than $500 billion for health care, or 11.2percent of its gross national product _ far more than any othernation _ but ranks 19th in the world on infant mortality.   Reagan accelerated a Pentagon buildup that Carter had begun, butit came to halt midway through his second term, and now Bush isfaced with the task of cutting the military's spending plans by $200billion or more over the next several years.   Among the most expensive military plans is Reagan's StrategicDefense Initiative, which will cost far more than the currentresearch budget of $4 billion-plus if Bush makes good on his promiseto press ahead with the research and ultimately deploy thespace-based shield against nuclear attack.   While Bush made political hay during the campaign over DemocratMichael Dukakis' opposition to both a mobile MX and the Midgetmanmissile, he acknowledged after the election that the nation probablycannot afford both modernized land missiles and that his defensesecretary, John Tower, will have a painful choice to make.   The problems of the savings and loan industry, which the GeneralAccounting Office says may cost $112 billion to fix, have landed onBush's lap. Even with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's bailouts of217 sick Sandamp;Ls there are still 350 insolvent Sandamp;Ls and 150 othersnearing the brink.   The Energy Department says it will cost up to $128 billion overthe next two decades to clean up nuclear arms plants and researchfacilities, a problem which only in recent months has worked its wayinto the public consciousness. The only three reactors capable ofproducing tritium, a vital ingredient in the nation's nuclear armsstockpile, have been shut down by safety problems.   Reagan left office with nine Americans still hostage in Lebanon.The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 before Christmas, with the loss of270 lives, dramatized that terrorism remains a scourge on the worldscene.   Despite a late opening of talks with the Palestine LiberationOrganization, little progress was made under Reagan toward bringingthe nations in the Middle East together toward a peaceful resolutionof their long, deep-seated hostilities.   Reagan and his successor, Bush, can point to such positivedevelopments in the past year as the cease fire in the Iran-Iraqwar, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and a U.S.-engineeredsettlement in Angola.   In Central America, Congress put an end to U.S. support for theContras in Nicaragua, and the Sandinista government there no longerfaces sustained attacks from the anti-communist rebels.   A solution to the problem of staggering Third World debts, muchof it owed by Latin nations to U.S. banks, eluded James Baker III asReagan's Treasury secretary. Now, as Bush's secretary of state,Baker again will be faced with the problem of how to promoteprosperity among the U.S. neighbors to the south.   Many experts fear that the hemisphere's turn away fromdictatorships and toward democratic institutions will be reversed ifinterest on the debts continues to sap the economies of SouthAmerica.</TEXT></DOC>
