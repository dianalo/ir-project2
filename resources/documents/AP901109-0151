Journalists are demanding an end to the strict laws that werecarried over from the regime of former dictator Manuel AntonioNoriega, who was overthrown by the U.S. invasion in December.   The government has used the laws to issue summons to reporterswho attended an opposition news conference and to arrest on chargesof criminal slander a columnist who had criticized Endara.   Organizers of a protest march on Thursday vowed to impose ``thelaw of ice'' and freeze coverage of the president. Severalnewspapers and radio stations referred to Endara on Friday only as``the president of the republic,'' without mentioning his name.   Endara, speaking to reporters before leaving Friday to attendthe enthronement of Emperor Akihito in Japan, said he was shockedby the behavior of reporters who confronted him after Thursday'smarch.   Endara said he had refused to receive the demonstrators in hisoffice because ``they wanted to enter just because they werereporters, as if they were the sacred cows of this republic, andthey aren't.''   ``That was an uproar of the worst sort ... the things theyshouted at me were really outrageous. I could not receive or talkto any person who shouts in that way,'' he said.   Endara's press secretary, Rene Hernandez said ``the president'spolicy is to defend freedom of expression,'' but he said``criticism should not be confused with calumny.''   He said if reporters want the laws changed, they should petitionthe legislature.</TEXT></DOC>
