The first three chapters developthe concept of technical professionalism, Chapters 4-7 then focus onthe technocrat's role in providing a spur from their positions withinthe policy community's bureaucracies that drives top-level policy decisions.These functions are examined in more detail using two case studies, thefirst concerned with the evolution of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., thesecond with the Inquiry (in 1977) into the proposal by BNFL to extendits Windscale site (now known as Sellafield) to build the Thermal OxideReprocessing Plant.
