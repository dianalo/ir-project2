As more ministers than had been expected arrived here overthe weekend, a consensus seemed to build that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might turn whathad been billed as a series of informal talks into afull-blown meeting. Such a formal meeting could officiallyact on proposals by some countries that they be allowed toproduce more oil to replace embargoed Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.</LP><TEXT>   A previous request by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for suchan extraordinary conference, or emergency meeting, failed toreceive majority approval and was rejected by Sadek Boussena,Algeria's oil minister and OPEC's president.   Even Mr. Boussena, who has insisted that the consumingnations should draw down their high oil inventories beforeasking OPEC to produce more, showed some signs of flexibilityon the issue that has sharply divided the organization. &quot;Theonly thing we have in mind is to save OPEC,&quot; he said on hisarrival.   Of OPEC's 13 member nations, 11 were represented here bylast night. The only absentees were the ministers from Iraqand Libya. Libya's minister is still expected.   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates arethought to be capable of making up three million barrels aday of the four million barrels taken out of world oilmarkets by the embargo. The three countries would like to geta meeting to officially approve output beyond their currentquotas, though it has been clear they intend to increaseproduction, anyway, if OPEC's clearance isn't forthcomingsoon.   Iraq strongly opposes such a move by OPEC, and has beensupported by several other members who argue that OPEC's lateJuly production agreement shouldn't be altered until there isreal evidence of tight supplies. Some worry that changingthat agreement would appear to be bowing to U.S. wishes tohold down petroleum prices while the U.S. leads globalsanctions against Iraq and Kuwait.   On Friday, oil prices eased but remained above the$30-a-barrel mark. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkcrude, fell $1.05 to $30.90, while in the internationalmarket, North Sea Brent dropped $1.20 to $31.20.   Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, renewed thecall for an emergency session on his arrival. &quot;We need totake some action {now},&quot; said Mr. Armas, adding: &quot;The worldis waiting for OPEC.&quot;   Venezuela already is pumping more than its quota of 1.9million barrels a day, but the additional oil is going intostorage, Mr. Armas said. Other officials from Venezuelaconfirmed that the country's national oil company canincrease output by 350,000 barrels a day within a week and byan additional 150,000 barrels a day by year end.   The UAE could exceed its quota by a similar amount, whileSaudi Arabia is understood to be capable of producing as muchas two million barrels a day over its quota, making up 50% ofthe four million barrels of oil taken out of world markets bythe embargo.   Supporting the wish of those three countries to raiseoutput is a delegation from Kuwait's government-in-exile.Heading the delegation is Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait'sfinance minister and former oil minister.   Sheik Ali was the architect of Kuwait's long-standingpractice of over-production. That practice particularlyenraged Iraq, which contended the excess Kuwait productiondepressed oil prices and kept Iraq from gaining funds neededto rebuild its war-torn economy.   Sheik Ali slipped out of Kuwait the night of Iraq'sinvasion and has been shepherding his country's vast globalinvestments and its oil policy from exile. He had little tosay on his arrival other than to express hope for anagreement on increased quotas for &quot;those who can produce&quot;more.   Others backing the Saudi-Venezuela proposal are the UnitedArab Emirates, Ecuador and Qatar. Delegates from thesecountries not only support expanded output by OPEC'sproducers but also recommend that consuming nations drawadditional supplies from their government and commercialstockpiles. That combination, they argue, would change themarket psychology that has resulted in a doubling of oilprices since June.</TEXT></DOC>
