Literally.   Here comes one now. You hear him before you see him -- alow roar -- and then a blue biplane appears from the cloudsand bumps to a halt on the bank's grass airstrip. MarkO'Connor, a mechanic and amateur pilot, strolls into the OldWest-style building to make a monthly loan payment. Fiveminutes later, lollipop in hand, he's ready for the 40-mileflight back to the Dallas area.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I suppose it'd be cheaper if I spent 29 cents for a stampinstead of paying for the gas to fly out,&quot; the 25-year-oldMr. O'Connor says. &quot;But I just like the people here, and theservice is great.&quot;   In an era when many equate bigger with better in banking,and giant banks are growing even larger through mergers, manyof America's community banks still know how to pleasecustomers.   Sure, the BankAmericas and Citicorps can arrangemultibillion-dollar credits and trade your German marks forJapanese yen, but their chairmen won't normally come to you.Michael Murray does. The chairman of Merchants andamp;Manufacturers Bancorp. in Greendale, Wis., decided in Januaryto give his office to a colleague and work from his car. Theidea was to spend more time with customers -- and he has. Innine months, he has logged 15,000 miles and visited scores ofcurrent and potential customers.   Ask community bankers whether big-bank mergers are athreat, and many react like Tom Hales, chairman of UnionState Bank in Nanuet, N.Y., who proudly proclaims, &quot;We can doanything that the big banks do.&quot;   Such talk may seem like mere bravado, but many communitybankers contend that they will thrive amid the mergers andtakeovers by focusing on local needs that big banks can't orwon't provide. &quot;There are few consumers who need bankingoffices in Hong Kong, Florida or Los Angeles,&quot; says DianeCasey, executive director of the Independent BankersAssociation of America. &quot;That is a benefit for corporations,but what does that do for Paul's hardware store or Joe'srestaurant?&quot;   Meanwhile, local customers are finding that, like bigbanks, many small banks can offer conveniences such as creditcards, cash machines and trust and annuity services. And bysticking to home cooking while their bigger brethren were outexperimenting with spicy Third World loans and commercialreal estate, the small fry have emerged as the healthiestsector of the banking industry.   In the second quarter, the 9,079 banks with assets of lessthan $100 million chalked up an average return on assets of0.99%, or more than twice the profitability of the 46 banksover $10 billion, according to Ferguson andamp; Co., a consultingfirm in Irving, Texas. And they enjoyed a fat 9.23% ratio ofequity capital to assets, against just 5.41% for big banks --many of which are struggling to meet federal capitalrequirements.   However, small banks face huge challenges. Giant banks canbetter handle razor-thin interest margins. They offermore-sophisticated services than small banks can, a gulf thatwill widen if banks are allowed to plunge into insurance andsecurities underwriting, as the Bush administration proposes.   And if Congress passes an administration proposal to allowbig banks to open branches anywhere in the nation,moneycenter institutions will impinge on community banks asnever before. Currently, banks can operate out-of-statebranches only if the branches are part of an acquired bankholding company or if they are permitted under regionalagreements between neighboring states.   &quot;This is the wild card,&quot; says Chuck Doyle, chairman ofTexas Independent Bancshares Inc., a consortium of fivecommunity banks in East Texas.   The long-anticipated wave of big-bank mergers has alreadybegun, with the proposed combinations of Chemical BankingCorp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. on the East Coast andof BankAmerica Corp. and Security Pacific Corp. on the WestCoast. Besides seeking to cut costs and strengthen capital,these newly created giants will be itching to expand theirbranch systems and market share, most likely at the expenseof small independents in suburban and rural areas. A recentFederal Reserve study predicts that the number of U.S. bankswill fall to 6,000 to 7,000 by the year 2010 from the current12,500.   The big banks have technology and economies of scale ontheir side, enabling them to underprice smaller competitors.Their heavy investments in electronic technology, forexample, will solve expensive problems such as processingchecks. The community banks -- generally defined as thosewith assets under $1 billion -- &quot;simply can't match this,&quot;says Sanford Rose, an associate at Oliver Wyman andamp; Co., a NewYork consulting firm.   So, what will save small banks? Some are banding togetherto trim back-office expenses, but, overwhelmingly, they citetheir personal service and customers' loyalty. &quot;We might notbe the lowest-cost bank,&quot; says Brenda I. Copeland, chairmanof Bank of Castile, a $94-million-asset bank near Rochester,N.Y.; but people &quot;can talk to the manager, whom they know.&quot;   The service comes in both usual and unusual ways. Fly-inbanking, for example, has certainly raised the market profileof First State Bank of Rio Vista (pop. 546). &quot;It's mostly anovelty,&quot; admits Lowell &quot;Stretch&quot; Smith Jr., the chairman,who cleared a field behind his bank for the airstrip nearly30 years ago because he had a lot of customers with airplaneloans and, partly, because he used to fly himself.   About 1,000 customers have been inducted into the bank's&quot;Cow Pasture Squadron,&quot; having negotiated a landing on thebumpy field. The fly-in clients are mostly local ranchers andhobbyists who grab any excuse to get airborne. Dick Siegel,the traffic reporter for a Dallas-area radio station, touchesdown in his helicopter monthly to do his banking. &quot;It's thebest damn bank going,&quot; he says firmly.   At Blue Ball National Bank in Pennsylvania, customersdon't fly in. Many pull up in horse-drawn buggies.   About 20% of the bank's business comes from Mennonites andAmish people, and their buggies are often lined up with carsat the drive-in window. The $303 million asset bank, in theheart of Lancaster County, tries hard to cater to the &quot;plainpeople.&quot; Two farm-loan officers handle most of their businessand make house calls to customers who can't easily get totown.   Blue Ball National has made other adjustments. Amish andMennonites don't believe in insurance, normally aprerequisite for a mortgage. The bank gets around this byaccepting a letter from a local church leader promising thatif the house securing a loan burns down, the church willrebuild it. In its 85 years, the bank has never foreclosed ona loan to an Amish or Mennonite farmer. Plain people &quot;have avery good work ethic, and they tend to meet theirobligations,&quot; says Melvin Pankuch, the bank's president.   Though perhaps not going quite so far, some big banks finda way to offer the kind of personal service found at smallones. Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, has been quitesuccessful in Texas, where it has acquired many branches buthas left them in the control of local bankers, who arebeholden to the holding company only in meeting operatinggoals. &quot;The branches have a community feel to them,&quot; saysCynthia A. Glassman, director of research at Furash andamp; Co., aWashington, D.C., consulting firm.   Big banks don't find it easy emulating that communityfeel, however, because of higher employee turnover andbecause transfers and promotions cut the ranks of home-grownpeople in a branch network.   Customers can tell. Enticed by higher rates and lowerfees, Michael Smith has taken his account to big banksseveral times. But the retired supermarket manager has alwayseventually returned to Union State Bank of Nanuet. &quot;I knowthe people who work there and they take care of me,&quot; heexplains. &quot;I don't think you can say the same thing about thebranches of those big banks.&quot;   Many small banks hope to fend off big-bank encroachment byemphasizing such ties. &quot;We're really focused on thecommunity,&quot; says A. Pierce Stone, president of VirginiaNational Bank, which has four offices between Charlottesvilleand Richmond, Va. &quot;We financed a lot of businesses that wouldhave not been otherwise. It's good for the town, and it'sgood for us because we live here.&quot; Although Virginia Nationalhasn't grown this year, it remains one of the most profitablearea banks, with 21% return on equity, Mr. Stone says.   But the number of customers who, like Mr. Smith, desireface-to-face contact is shrinking, says Edward O'Neal,Chemical's vice chairman for retail operations. &quot;There is agrowing age group that is now more easily and preferablydealing with the bank over the phone or through mail,&quot; headds. &quot;Community banks are going to continue making money andpeople are going to want what community banks offer, but overtime, the share of the household profit for that financialinstitution is going to wither away.&quot;   Community bankers concede the loss of some customers butare matching their bigger rivals' services in many areas.Small banks can now offer credit cards issued by theIndependent Bankers Association. And some of them can evengive the giants a run for their money on pricing.   A few weeks ago, when big banks cut their prime lendingrate to 8%, they were about 20 years behind Lamont Bank ofSaint John, Wash. Lamont has refused to alter its 8% interestrate since the 1970s. Even when inflation topped 20%, itscustomers could borrow at 8%.   Of course, there's a catch: Lamont's depositors earn amiserly 3.5% on savings accounts. Neal Robertson, who runsthe bank, says customers at the $9 million bank, mostlyfarmers, put up with the low savings rates because of thetrade-off, though they do send surplus cash to higher-payingbanks in the city.   And some small banks are taking advantage of big-bankmergers. After BankAmerica and Security Pacific announcedtheir mega-merger, little Bank of A. Levy in Ventura County,Calif., attacked with a flood of newspaper ads painting itsmerging rivals as impersonal institutions. One ad depictedthree faceless bankers and the headline &quot;Don't give yourmoney to strangers.&quot; The result: Some 400 customers of thetwo big banks' local branches switched more than $10 millionin deposits to the smaller bank.   &quot;We've been competing within our county with some of thelargest banks in the country for some time, but this is thefirst time an opportunity has been created to steal awaymarket share from the big guys,&quot; says Marshall Milligan,chief executive and the great-grandson of the founder of Bankof A. Levy. &quot;We're very excited by the turn of events.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
