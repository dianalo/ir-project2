Two employees were injured in the fire that erupted late Fridaymorning at the Solvents andamp; Chemicals Inc. plant and burned all day.The explosions apparently were sparked by a punctured barrel thatignited.   The area surrounding the plant in an industrial area south ofHouston was ordered evacuated, but few people left and the order waslater lifted. Authorities did not believe toxic fumes were a problem.   Thick black smoke billowed for several hours and had almostdissipated by Friday evening, authorities said.   The plant continued to smolder with heavy smoke early today andfirefighters from several cities were fighting ``a few spot fires''with foam, said a Pearland fire department dispatcher who refused tobe identified.   ``It's under control now and we're just watching it and waitingfor it to go out on its own,'' said Susan Jarmon, another dispatcher.   Company spokesman George Foster said about 40 employees weresafely evacuated from the plant, which has about 50 storage tanksoutside.   ``Apparently there's a significant loss to the buildingstructure,'' Foster said. ``But the tanks seem to be intact.''   The 20-year-old company packages various chemicals for sale tohardware and grocery stores, including paint and lacquer thinners,windshield washer products and charcoal starters, said Jordi Baizan,another company spokesman.   Police Sgt. Armando Garza said he arrived when several 55-gallonbarrels began exploding. He said he heard about 30 explosions beforehe fled.   ``It was very loud and kind of scary,'' Garza said. ``You see a55-gallon barrel drum go some 300 feet into the air and you don'tknow where it's going to land.''   Eloy Salazar, 26, was the most seriously injured with second-andthird-degree burns on his chest, face and back.   ``They were apparently depressurizing some 55-gallon drums andthere was a spark, I believe from a fork lift, and that set off thefire,'' said Dr. Jeff Britton, who treated Salazar.   Another employee, 49-year-old Alexander Jacky, was treated forminor burns to his forearm. Six firefighters and emergency workerswere also treated for heat exhaustion or smoke inhalation.</TEXT></DOC>
