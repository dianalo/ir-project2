IBM had said in March 1988 that within two years it would haveUnix-based software for its full range of computers.   Unix is a base layer of software developed by American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co. that theoretically enables many kinds of computersto run the same programs with little or no modification. That is notactually possible because Unix has become fragmented into manyversions, but efforts are under way to unify it.   IBM's version of Unix is called AIX.
