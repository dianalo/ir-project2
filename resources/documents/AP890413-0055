Drug agents in this Sinaloa state capital have discovered fieldsof marijuana outside town that were irrigated and nurtured like anyother crop. Five-thousand tons were burned in one raid in 1984.   Culiacan also is home to a shrine to the ``narcosanton,'' or``big narco-saint,'' Jesus Malverde, a common criminal who died in1909 and is believed by some to provide protection and cureillnesses.   The shrine, condemned as pagan by the Roman Catholic Church, isless than a block from the statehouse in Culiacan, a city of 1.3million people about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City.   In 1985 and 1986, Culiacan became known as ``Little Chicago''because there were so many killings _ an average of five a day.   According to the book ``Desperados'' by Elaine Shannon, peoplewere afraid to sit by their windows for fear of stray bullets. Thebook quotes an unidentified army officer as saying more than 500girls were kidnapped and raped during those years.   Reports that Felix Gallardo was at one time hiding out in thegovernor's house were taken seriously, although the governor deniedthe allegation.   When federal authorities decided to move against Felix Gallardoand corrupt officials on Saturday, they trusted Culiacan's policeso little they took the entire force, all 600 of them, into custody.   Army troops had been dispatched to arrest top local and statepolice officials.   But Culiacan was not Felix Gallardo's home at the time of hisarrest. He moved to Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city,years ago and that's where he was caught.   On Wednesday, federal prosecutors charged him with criminalconspiracy and illegal possession of weapons. On Tuesday, he wascharged with multiple counts of possessing, transporting andtrading in illegal drugs.   He has issued no plea.   About 200 special agents on Wednesday checked records at banksand land offices in five states, seeking millions of dollars inhidden bank accounts and properties.   After agent Enrique Camarena Salazar of the U.S. DrugEnforcement Administration was slain in March 1985 _ a killingFelix Gallardo reported opposed _ the accused drug lord lived undercover and moved frequently, U.S. officials say.   He managed to escape the clutches of Mexican police for yearsbecause corrupt officials allegedly protected him.   Officials estimate Felix Gallardo's holdings are worth more than$500 million, much of it invested in legitimate businesses inCuliacan and Guadalajara. He had 50 cars, at least three airplanesand raised thoroughbred horses, they say.   On Wednesday, federal police and troops shuttered businesses ofsuspected drug traffickers in Culiacan, and pickup trucks loadedwith soldiers occasionally cruised the streets.   The Chamber of Commerce disputed claims that Felix Gallardo wasa major player in Culiacan's economy.   ``I don't believe the economy here benefited significantly fromFelix Gallardo. From what I know, he invested his money in manyplaces,'' said Francisco Javier Partida Perez, the chamber director.   People say Felix Gallardo rarely was seen in public in recentyears, and questions about him were met with suspicion.   ``Why do you want to know? Who are you?'' asked a cashier inresponse to a question about what she thought of his arrest.   Most officials were unavailable for comment.   The mayor was too busy to receive reporters. The governor wasmeeting with the president in Mexico City. The acting police chiefreferred all questions to the prosecutor's office, and theprosecutor was in meetings.   ``It's a hot potato. Nobody wants to touch it,'' said a policeofficer who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The police, for their part, appeared to be more upset aboutbeing held in custody for 24 hours than anything else.   Local police officers were detained Saturday to avoid leaks or ashootout while federal authorities arrested officials who allegedlytook bribe money from Felix Gallardo. Those seized included thestate's top drug-enforcement officer and the city police chief.   One Culiacan officer worried about how the case would affect hisdepartment's image.   ``It hurts our reputation,'' he said. ``Now people will thinkwe're all crooked.''</TEXT></DOC>
