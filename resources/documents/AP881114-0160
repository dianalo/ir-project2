Concern has grown as the Energy Department has disclosed problemsat some of its nuclear production plants and has wholly or partlyclosing down four of its 17 major facilities. Officials haveestimated cleanup will cost $110 billion.   The three reactors at the Savannah River plant, a nuclear weaponsfacility near Aiken, S.C., have been shut down because of safetyproblems. DOE officials have said tritium gas has accidentallyleaked from the reactors on several occasions, but they added theamounts of the gas did not pose a danger to public health.   The Savannah reactors make tritium and plutonium needed innuclear weapons. They will have to be reopened within six months toensure a continued supply, said Chris West, a DOE spokesman.   ``We do not want to operate unsafe reactors or any unsafefacilities, but on the other hand we've got the crunch,'' West said.   He said Energy Department experts are evaluating the Savannahplant and hope to have it restarted by December, although that dateis tentative.   ``The bottom line is that this country's national defense isbased on the nuclear deterrent, and basically it has been since theTruman administration,'' West said.   Last year, the APHA endorsed a resolution calling for a ban onnuclear testing.   ``These facilities must be phased out,'' said Jennie Tichenor, anurse and assistant director of the New York City-based RadioactiveWaste Campaign. She said the federal government should ``close themdown, undo as much as possible and never repeat it.''   The panel called for appropriating money to retrain workers whowould lose their jobs if the plants were closed down; exhumingon-site waste; making the Energy Department subject to publicscrutiny; and conducting epidemiological studies of workers.</TEXT></DOC>
