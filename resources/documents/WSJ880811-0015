Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD FIN BON PCS PET </IN><G> TRE </G><TEXT>   Cattle futures prices rose sharply in response to brisk demand for beef in anticipation of the Labor Day holiday.    Beef packers were paying top prices for livestock yesterday, lifting wholesale prices, analysts said.    Cash prices for live cattle rose to 69 cents a pound, the highest level since mid-June, in Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma. The gains followed a general decline through June and July, when prices hit a low of 66 cents a pound.    Anticipation that cash prices will hit record levels over the next year spurred the gains, analysts said. &quot;Demand has been good for beef,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, an analyst with Sterling Research Corp.    Futures contracts for delivery this fall and winter posted the sharpest gains, with prices for October delivery rising the 1.5-cent-a-pound permissible daily limit to 71.275 cents a pound. Prices for December delivery rose 1.35 cents to 73.4 cents.    Traders also expect the Agriculture Department to report a decline in cattle on feedlots in major beef-producing states in a monthly survey scheduled for release next Monday. The decrease would signal reduced beef supplies in the future.    Hog futures followed cattle higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices for August delivery rose 0.45 cent to 45.9 cents a pound. Analysts cited a Chicago Mercantile Exchange report late Tuesday showing that last week's consumption of frozen pork bellies in exchange-approved warehouses outside Chicago exceeded traders' expectations.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices fell 1 1/4 points as the Federal Reserve Board's half-point rise in the discount rate Tuesday continued to roil the financial markets. The weak close in bond futures at 3 p.m. EDT spilled over into the stock and stock futures markets, helping to send the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 50 points in intraday trading before the 30-stock average bounced back somewhat to close at 2034.14, down 44.99. Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures for September settlement fell 5.35 to 262.05. Lackluster bidding for the Treasury Department's auction of $11 billion in 10-year notes, and rumors of pending prime rate increases by major banks, also weighed heavily on interest rate futures prices. &quot;The 10-year was a dog of an issue, nobody was really interested in bidding,&quot; said Karen Gibbs, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. The Fed's action, aimed at curbing rising inflation, should benefit fixed-income markets over the longer-term. But for now, &quot;the Fed has set everybody on edge, they put a lot of uncertainty into the market,&quot; says Frederick Leiner, futures strategist with Continental Illinois Corp. in Chicago.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices advanced, with platinum in the lead as it added to Tuesday's gains. December delivery gold rose $1.60 an ounce to $439.40, while September silver was up eight cents an ounce to $6.71. Platinum for October delivery -- which fell more than $19 Monday and bucked Tuesday's downward trend to end slightly higher -- surged $13.50 yesterday to settle at $535.80 an ounce. An analyst said that fresh dealer demand for platinum sparked by Monday's price plunge was continuing yesterday and caused some short sellers to throw in the towel and buy contracts, accelerating the advance. All three precious metals got a boost yesterday from a softer dollar, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc. He theorized that platinum got an extra boost from a wire service report on Thursday's expected House vote on a bill calling for sanctions against South Africa, the world's leading platinum producer. The report said Japan was ready to buy South African rhodium exports at premium prices if the sanctions pass. Mr. Savaiko surmised that the prospect of Japan paying premium for rhodium -- a member of the platinum metals group -- sparked speculation that Japan might do the same to line up platinum supplies to profit by reselling it to U.S. companies who wouldn't be free to buy direct from South Africa if the sanctions pass.    ENERGY: Gasoline prices fell in response to oil statistics released by the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday which showed that U.S. inventories of gasoline have been building as the summer driving season wanes. Traders were selling gasoline contracts and buying crude oil and heating oil contracts, said Madison Galbraith, senior trader for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures group. After declining Tuesday, crude oil prices edged upward slightly yesterday. Industry traders and brokers say they expect crude oil to range between $14.50 a barrel and $16.50 a barrel for at least the next week barring any unforeseen news event. Market participants took little notice of news on the Iran-Iraq ceasefire. Reports that Iran is stiffening its stance on terms of any ceasefire agreement by demanding that Iraq be charged as the aggressor and instigator of the eight-year war wasn't even grist for rumor-mongering on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange where oil futures contracts are traded, one trader said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn, wheat and soybean futures edged higher in quiet trading before the expected release of a major Agriculture Department crop report today. Many traders squared their books, especially in corn futures, to avoid heavy losses in the event of a big surprise. The report will be the government's first in-field survey of the year and is expected to show heavy damage to both corn and soybeans. </TEXT></DOC>
