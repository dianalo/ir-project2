But before lenders agree tofund the landmark transaction, they might want to take aclose look under the hood of the once-dominant carrier.   The union proposal, approved Friday by UAL directors, doeshave some appealing elements. It requires $2 billion lessdebt than last year's failed bid by a group that includedmanagement and the pilots union. There are plenty of assetsto serve as collateral and, notably, United's unions agreedto substantial wage cuts to make the plan work.</LP><TEXT>   But the risks loom large as well. This is a companyconsumed -- and exhausted -- by buy-out fever. Over the lastthree years, the UAL board has considered a total of fiveseparate bids for the company. Even if this latest proposalis completed, it might require an additional six to eightmonths of wrangling and further distraction. Moreover, theunions involved in the latest deal aren't exactly an exampleof like-mindedness: They tend to squabble with each other asmuch as they squabble with management. Thus, employee moralehas been sinking and, with management absorbed with bids andcounterbids, UAL has simply squandered many businessopportunities.   United was so preoccupied with a proposed buy-out a fewmonths ago, for instance, that it had to withdraw from acompetition for what might have been its first route toEurope -- between Chicago and Glasgow, Scotland. AlthoughUnited appeared to have the early edge, it was so busy withinternal battles it ended up unable to prove to theTransportation Department that it had enough planes for thenew route. American Airlines picked up the business bydefault, and acknowledges that it wouldn't have won if Unitedhadn't been so distracted by buy-out proposals.   British Airways, which has extensive marketing ties withUnited, also has grown fidgety. At a Chicago luncheon lastweek, Lord King, British Air's chairman, expressed concernabout the partnership and said he hoped United could soonreturn to focusing on the airline business.   Indeed, while rivals like American have grown rapidly,United has stagnated. Ever since its pilots union firstbroached the idea of a buy-out three years ago, its share ofthe domestic airline business has remained stalled at 17%.United has lost ground to competitors at some of its keyhubs, and now American is even threatening to usurp United'sdominance on its home turf: Chicago's O'Hare Airport. In thelast six months alone, United has trimmed its revenueprojections for future years by as much as $1.5 billionannually.   If the employee bid succeeds, it is likely that Unitedwill lose many of its top managers. The unions already havesaid they will replace UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, whofought behind the scenes to sink their plan. If he departs,many of the executives he recruited will undoubtedly leave,too. That has led people in the airline industry to wonderwhether the unions will be able to assemble a competentmanagement team on their own.   &quot;The costs of this transaction are more than meet theeye,&quot; says Karen Firestone, manager of the Fidelity AirTransportation Fund, which owns UAL stock. &quot;It's not just thepurchase price; you have to look at what's been happening tothe airline-management distraction, lack of immediatecompetitive planning during the past year, and a demoralizedemployee base.&quot;   Passengers sometimes felt the brunt of the company'sinternal chaos. In the past 12 months, United ranked next tolast in terms of on-time performance. Its worst period waslast summer, when the pilots and flight attendants, workingwithout a contract, refused to volunteer any overtime. Theresult: unprecedented flight delays and cancellations.   It is possible, of course, that an employee buy-out couldcure many of these ills. Despite some highly publicizedfailures of employee-owned firms, such as the 1986 bankruptcyfiling of bearings-maker Hyatt Clark Industries Inc., workerownership has proven at least as successful as other forms ofcorporate takeovers, according to Joseph R. Blasi, professorat the Institute of Management and Labor Relations at RutgersUniversity. He estimates employees currently are majorityowners of about 1,500 companies in the U.S.   For their part, United's unions predict the transactionwill end the bickering that has divided the carrier. &quot;Webelieve {the acquisition} will stabilize this company,especially in view of all the turmoil that it's been goingthrough for all these months,&quot; says John Peterpaul, anational vice president of the International Association ofMachinists, who is representing the United machinists in thetransaction. Mr. Peterpaul forecasts that &quot;a new type of workethic&quot; will emerge at the carrier if the plan goes through.   But the proposal also would take United into unchartedair. Most employee buyouts have involved one major union plussalaried employees. In United's case, the owners would bethree big unions -- the pilots, the machinists and the flightattendants -- each with different interests and different paylevels for their members.   With so many competing groups, &quot;You have to be careful youdon't wind up with six different agendas&quot; for the company,says Ed Sambuchi, chief executive of McLouth Steel, a bigemployee-owned company in Trenton, Mich. Every month, McLouthmanagers clear a large garage in the plant to brief a groupof 60 to 70 workers on the same information given to theboard of directors two days earlier. But that kind ofcommunication and togetherness won't be possible at afar-flung operation like United.   There is also a good chance the deal will fall throughentirely. Although UAL's board gave the three unions up tofour months to secure financing -- plus another four monthsto complete the deal -- some lenders believe the chances ofobtaining the needed backing are only slightly better than50%, especially now that many lenders are turning up theirnoses at highly-leveraged transactions. &quot;I wouldn't want tobe raising $4 billion right now,&quot; says one executive at amajor U.S. bank.   Even though employee ownership yields major taxadvantages, those benefits would be more than offset at UALby the additional debt the unions plan to carry. KevinMurphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., estimatesthe buy-out will require $4 billion in bank financing on topof the $750 million note the unions are giving shareholders.That will add $500 million in extra annual interest costs.   To help fund that expense, the unions have pledged $300million in annual pay cuts that would grow to $500 million in1994. But those cuts are calculated off a hypothetical wagebase that rises 4% annually; so the cuts are less than theyappear. United's shrinking profit leaves little room forerror. Net income last year totaled $325 million and thisyear is expected to decline to $240 million. The buy-outwould increase United's debt sixfold, from $800 million tomore than $5 billion.   Skepticism over financing the transaction on Fridaycontributed to a $2-a-share decline in UAL's stock price.Shares closed at $163.50 in trading on the New York StockExchange. That was well below the unions' proposed buy-outprice of $201 a share, but the discount also reflects thelength of time investors would have to wait to get theirpayout, as well as the fact that only $155 a share of thepurchase price is cash.   As might be expected, the union plan also calls for anegalitarian approach to corporate governance. Seniormanagement would get to name three directors and there wouldbe one board seat for each of the unions. In addition, theunions would choose eight outside directors. The pilots wouldown 37.9% of the stock, the machinists 35.7% and the flightattendants 12.2%. The remainder would be held by noncontractemployees.   One factor the unions may have going for them is thegrowing weariness of UAL's board. Six months ago, thedirectors toasted what they thought was their last meetingtogether: the session at which they approved the $300-a-sharebuy-out led by UAL Chairman Wolf. But that deal collapsed,triggering one of the biggest stock market plunges inhistory.   Since then, sources say, the board has been anxious toresolve matters. Many of its members, such as John F.McGillicuddy of Manufacturers Hanover Trust or Frank A. Olsonof Hertz Corp., have little sentimental attachment to theairline business. In January, they grew so irritated with theslow progress being made by Mr. Wolf that they ordered him tostep aside as the chief negotiator with the unions. The boardturned the job over to one of its legal advisers, Lewis Kadenof the New York law firm of Davis Polk and Wardwell.   Meanwhile, employee morale continued to sink. As detailsof the proposed buy-out became public, company newslettersblasted the union's proposals as unfair to management andother non-union employees. Mr. Wolf was particularly criticalof the unions on a number of points, saying they hadovervalued their concessions and were asking for unreasonablejob guarantees. Union leaders responded with public salvos oftheir own.   Throughout January and February, the company delayedreleasing confidential financial projections that the unionneeded to set the price of its bid. When UAL finally providedthe projections, they were so pessimistic that the unionwould have had difficulty convincing lenders to finance thedeal, says one person who saw the data. The unions wereespecially angry because the numbers were vastly morenegative than projections management supplied to banks tosupport its own bid last September. When the unioncomplained, First Boston Corp., the board's adviser, agreedto recalculate the revenue projections; the numbers ended uphigher.   A UAL spokesman referred questions on the episode to FirstBoston, which declined to comment. One person familiar withthe projection process, however, said management ordered upconservative numbers after being criticized, after its ownbuy-out collapsed, for its earlier, overly rosy forecasts.Moreover, the projections compiled in February were lowerpartly because of increased fuel and maintenance costs, hesaid.   As the battle between management and the unions grew morestrained, the unions ultimately linked arms with ConistonPartners, UAL's largest shareholder, and threatened a proxyfight to oust the board. In the end, that didn't provenecessary. But the animosity stirred within the company wassubstantial.   United reservation agent Iris Racataian says employeeshave tried hard to keep the corporate turmoil from affectingtheir dealings with the public. But she acknowledges thesituation &quot;sure affects your pysche.&quot; Ms. Racataian says shebelieves uncertainty about the airline's future &quot;has hurt usin terms of our ability to get and keep the most productiveemployees.&quot;   The turmoil is visible from the outside, as well. &quot;There'sbeen this restiveness over there for a long time,&quot; saysJeffrey Kreindler, a Pan American World Airways vicepresident. &quot;It's not as if they've had a long period ofstability.&quot;   Thus, while American continues to amass jets, United hasmoved more slowly. American now has 500 aircraft to United's429, enabling it to expand domestically and make significantinroads in Europe. Indeed, American used United's own hub atChicago to help build its European network.   When it came time to expand its profitable routes in thePacific, United again discovered the price of preoccupation.For some time, management has been fighting with its pilotsunion over buying new planes: The union wants them, partly toassure that there will be an ever-increasing supply of jobsfor its members. Management, in turn, held out, intent onusing potential purchases of planes as a bargaining chip towin concessions from the pilots.   As a result of the internal wrangling, United didn't havethe planes it needed when it came time to expand its Asianroutes. So the airline has been forced to scavenge around,clipping a plane here and there from its domestic routes. Ithas covered its Pacific expansion, but at the cost ofbusiness domestically.   ---   Robert L.
