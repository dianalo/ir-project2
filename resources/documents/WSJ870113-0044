In an hourlong interview yesterday, Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's No. 2 political leader, said the faulty intelligence, like the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran, was meant to appease and assist Iran, which has been at war with Iraq for more than six years.    &quot;The arms scandal is expressive of a bigger U.S. program in the region aimed at conspiring with Iran against Iraq,&quot; he said.    The comments by Mr. Ramadan, Iraq's first deputy prime minister, are the first public charges by an Arab leader in reaction to reports that the U.S. gave Iraq misleading intelligence.    Mr. Ramadan's charge that the U.S. provided Iraq with &quot;intentionally misleading &quot; intelligence is the harshest public criticism yet of the U.S. by an Iraqi official. Since the news broke of the U.S.'s secret arms sales to Iran, Iraqi official comments have been restrained -- presumably to avoid alienating the Reagan administration.    But Mr. Ramadan yesterday shed that reticence. Sitting at his white Provencal desk, which is decorated with painted cherubs, Mr. Ramadan, a stocky, unsmiling man, puffed on a Cuban cigar and spoke rapidly and passionately through an interpreter. In a wide-ranging interview, he made the following points:    --Arms sales to Iran by the U.S. amounted to a &quot;poison dagger&quot; for Iraq, for the sales not only prolonged the Persian Gulf War, but also escalated the fighting.    --U.S. talk of freeing U.S. hostages was simply a &quot;cover-up&quot; for a U.S. tilt toward Iran.    --Iraq is on the verge of repulsing Iran's attack begun three days ago in southern Iraq near Basra, Iraq's second-largest city. But he added that the battle won't be the last. He declined to discuss Iraqi casualties, which Western diplomats believe have been heavy.    --Iraq will be even more aggressive this year in attacking Iran's ports, oil installations, refineries and tankers. &quot;All that is related to oil, we will hit.&quot;    But Mr. Ramadan placed the most emphasis on the misleading intelligence.    Officials in Washington have acknowledged privately that the U.S. passed Iraq and Iran faulty intelligence, according to published reports in recent days.    Yesterday CIA spokesman George Lauder denied the reports, saying &quot;the story is false&quot; that the U.S. had provided Iraq and Iran with intentionally misleading intelligence.    Mr. Ramadan said the U.S. intellgence began arriving soon after Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations in November 1984, after a 17-year hiatus. But he said Iraq first became suspicious of the intelligence's accuracy last February when the U.S. insisted Iran would attack a central point on the Iraq-Iran border, but Iran suddenly attacked Fao, at the southern tip of Iraq.    Iraqi forces suffered heavy casualties -- at least 15,000 dead by Western estimates. The Iraqi loss was a major psychological blow and gave a big boost to Iranian morale. Iran still occupies Fao with some 30,000 soldiers and revolutionary guards, which is more humiliating than militarily significant for Iraq.    &quot;This intelligence was intentionally misleading,&quot; Mr. Ramadan said. &quot;We received information directly from the U.S. and through the (Persian) Gulf states and Jordan -- all of whom got it from the U.S. -- that the Iranian attack wouldn't come at Fao. Even on the seventh day of the fighting the U.S. still said the main attack would be at a precise point elsewhere.    &quot;It's clear the U.S. wanted a defeat of Iraq. It's beyond doubt.&quot;    If Mr. Ramadan is correct that the same bad information was also passed to Jordan and the Gulf states, it would appear that the U.S. gave faulty intelligence to several nations, not just to Iran and Iraq, something sure to further undermine U.S. credibility in the Mideast.    Despite all this, Iraq continues to receive U.S. intelligence, which Western diplomats credit with the sharp increase in the success of Iraqi air attacks late last year against Iranian economic targets, including oil installations and power stations.    &quot;We don't prevent the arrival of such information,&quot; Mr. Ramadan said, &quot;But we don't trust it.&quot;    U.S. officials in Iraq declined to comment on Mr. Ramadan's charges because they routinely refuse to discuss intelligence.    Officials in Jordan, a close ally of Iraq, said last week they had sought to persuade Iraqi officials that perhaps the U.S. analysis of its information was wrong, that the U.S. surely hadn't deliberately deceived Iraq. That the U.S. apparently provided faulty information not just to Iraq, but to Jordan for Iraq, almost certainly will deepen the despair in Jordan at recent revelations about U.S. Mideast conduct.    The suspicion expressed by Mr. Ramadan publicly is symptomatic of the deep distrust of the U.S. in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast because of the discovery that the U.S. deceived the world about arms sales to Iran.    &quot;The complete conflict between what is being done and what is being said has created in us a profound pain,&quot; Mr. Ramadan said.    He added: &quot;Saying you are against continuation of the war, you are against arms to Iran, you create a special department to eradicate arms sales by the Europeans and others, so we are surprised that the U.S. regime itself is leading the supply of arms. Logic can't explain this.&quot;    Despite the distrust and disillusionment with the U.S., Iraq appears to be confident it can continue to defend itself against Iranian attacks. And so are Western diplomats here.    But with the increase in oil prices and the presumption in Iraq that U.S. arms sales to Iran have cleared the way for any nation to sell to Iran, the guessing is that Iran can both afford and find suppliers for arms. This has increased Iraqi resolve to stop Iranian exports of oil, one of the country's main sources of revenue.    &quot;We have transformed Iran from an oil exporter to an oil importer,&quot; boasted Mr. Ramadan. &quot;Our number one objective is to prevent Iran from exporting large quantities of oil.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
