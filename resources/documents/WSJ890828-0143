Senate conferees insisted that M. Danny Wall, head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, be allowed to keep his job as chief Sandamp;L regulator without going through reconfirmation hearings now that the board's duties have been shifted to a new Treasury office. House conferees finally gave in after Senators told them they were concerned confirmation hearings for the controversial Mr. Wall could be as vitriolic and damaging to Congress's reputation as were those of former Sen. John Tower.    A lot of members of Congress still don't want taxpayers ever to learn who bears responsibility for the Sandamp;L crisis that will cost each American family at least $4,000. There is more than enough blame to go around (Reps. Jim Wright and Tony Coelho, for example, have certainly paid a price for their shameless intervention on behalf of insolvent thrifts), but Mr. Wall, 49, has come through the Sandamp;L crisis with his role in it largely unexamined.    In the early 1980s, as a key aide to Senate Banking Committee chairman Jake Garn of Utah (the Senate conferee who most strongly backed him), Mr. Wall followed the wishes of the thrift industry by drafting legislation that allowed a new breed of high-flying Sandamp;L owner broad new powers to make risk-fraught loans and investments that were more appropriate in a casino than a financial institution. Then as head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from July 1987, Mr. Wall consistently played down the need to act on the mounting Sandamp;L mess until a massive taxpayer-paid bailout was inevitable.    For two years, Mr. Wall dismissed the need for a bailout by invoking elastic numbers. In July 1987, he said the cost of cleaning up insolvent Sandamp;Ls would be only $10.8 billion. By April 1988 he had raised it to $22.7 billion, to $30.9 billion by June, and then to $42.5 billion by July.    As recently as last November, Mr. Wall publicly maintained the Sandamp;L industry could still take care of its own mess at a time when outside analysts estimated losses at $100 billion and when the federal deposit insurance fund was in the red by $56 billion. He told skeptics, &quot;The next president and the next Congress will decide how much more funding we need, if any. They will also judge how well we have done.&quot;    Most members now share the judgment of GOP Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa: &quot;This Bank Board did the opposite of making timely warnings. It tried to put people to sleep while a fire was raging.&quot; Bert Ely, a financial consultant, says Mr. Wall's rubber numbers served the interests of many in Congress and the White House by delaying full discussion of the crisis until after the 1988 election.    Many in Congress also fault Mr. Wall's actions to keep open Lincoln Savings of Irvine, Calif., for two years after the San Francisco Bank Board recommended it be closed &quot;as a threat to the taxpayers.&quot; Lincoln piled up $1.3 billion in additional losses before it was closed in April.    In early 1988, Mr. Wall cast the deciding vote to transfer regulatory jurisdiction of Lincoln away from the San Francisco board to Washington, an unprecedented move that &quot;made many regulators want to throw up,&quot; former Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Ed Gray, Mr. Wall's predecessor as Bank Board chairman, says. Lincoln's regulatory victory encouraged other highly speculative Sandamp;Ls to resist being reined in.    Two of the Senate conferees on the Sandamp;L bill -- Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) -- who fought hard to retain Mr. Wall also pressured federal regulators in 1987 to go easy on Lincoln Savings. Lincoln happened to be owned by Charles Keating Jr., a major contributor to their campaigns. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that Sen. Cranston feared that any new confirmation hearings for Mr. Wall would focus unwanted attention on Lincoln.    How did someone like Mr. Wall, a living embodiment of the Peter Principle, end up supervising the nation's thrifts? Mr. Wall was an assistant city administrator in Utah when he first went to work for Sen. Garn. After the 1980 GOP capture of the Senate, Mr. Garn unexpectedly became Banking Committee chairman and named the inexperienced Mr. Wall the committee's staff director.    The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the lobbying arm for Sandamp;L's, saw an opportunity. In 1980, the League had persuaded Congress to raise federal deposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000 per account, allowing expansion-minded Sandamp;Ls to attract more capital by offering high interest rates sweetened with taxpayer guarantees.    But Sandamp;Ls were still limited in the kind of investments they could make. So Richard Hohlt, a chief lobbyist for the League, went to work cultivating Mr. Wall. The Washington Post's Kathleen Day reported that his number was the first one listed on Mr. Wall's speed-dial telephone. Mr. Wall, who is largely self-taught on banking matters and has a reputation for not being skilled with numbers, trusted Mr. Hohlt's judgment and expertise, according to Bank Board sources. Mr. Wall soon earned a reputation for taking all-expense paid junkets, a practice that would be illegal in the executive branch. In 1985, Senate records show Mr. Wall took 30 trips sponsored by the League and other financial groups, more than any other Congressional staffer. Mr. Wall says they were &quot;fact-finding missions&quot; to meet with industry leaders.    Mr. Hohlt's lobbying paid off. In 1982, Sen. Garn co-authored a banking bill that allowed thrifts to invest in such risky ventures as office buildings and windmills. With deposit insurance covering the questionable investments, the only one at risk was the taxpayer.    By 1986, it was clear many thrifts were losing money on their high-risk ventures and had little cushion to absorb losses. Ed Gray was winning the League's enmity by pushing for curbs on risky investments. The League decided Mr. Gray had to leave at the end of his term. &quot;When it came to Congress, what the League wanted, it got,&quot; says Rep. Leach. It wanted Danny Wall to replace Ed Gray.    So did his supportive boss, Sen. Garn, whose personal secretary is Mr. Wall's wife. After much arm-twisting, President Reagan appointed Mr. Wall, who won swift confirmation. He entered the banking job by announcing that unlike Mr. Gray, who had emphasized the industry's problems, he would also focus on the 75% of the industry that was healthy. &quot;We have to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative,&quot; Mr. Wall said. He predicted his relations with Congress would be good: &quot;I'm a child of the Senate.&quot;    Mr. Wall's defenders say he had a good reason for playing down the size of the Sandamp;L bailout -- the fear of sparking depositor runs on thrifts -- and that given Congress's irresponsibility he cannot be faulted for acting in a politically expedient fashion. Mr. Wall himself is now somewhat bitter about his old friends in Congress. &quot;They gave us a Band-Aid, and said take care of it until 1989,&quot; he said recently. But federal regulators are meant to be &quot;public servants,&quot; and Mr. Wall consistently preferred the interests of a powerful constituency to those of the taxpayer. In so doing, he became more of a &quot;political servant&quot; to those in Congress and the White House who controlled his career.    For example, both Congress and the White House clearly want to preserve a separate Sandamp;L industry, even though the distinction between thrifts and other financial institutions makes little sense in today's economy. So rather than push for healthy banks to take over insolvent Sandamp;Ls, Mr. Wall has tried to force the ailing Sandamp;Ls into dubious mergers. With the deposit insurance fund grossly underfunded by Congress, Mr. Wall was forced to give acquirers billions in tax breaks -- pledging that the government will make up any losses the Sandamp;Ls take on their book value -- to induce them to sit on problem loans. Ronald Perelman, a New York financier, is getting $5 billion in assistance to take over some failed thrifts in a deal that is virtually risk-free to him. &quot;They've taken a lot of dead horses and stitched them into one big horse that's just as dead and stinks even more,&quot; says House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas). Having avoided reconfirmation, Mr. Wall will serve as the chief Sandamp;L regulator until his term expires in 1991, and perhaps beyond. As is his nature, he now wants to &quot;accentuate the positive&quot; and look to the future. He dismisses estimates that the new bailout bill doesn't begin to cover the real costs of the Sandamp;L mess. Asked recently who was responsible for the Sandamp;L mess, he replied: &quot;The point isn't whose responsibility it is. That's all history.&quot;    ---   Mr. Fund is a Journal editorial writer. </TEXT></DOC>
