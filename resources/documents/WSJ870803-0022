But the modest recovery masks fundamental changes in the makeup and conduct of U.S. farm trade, once the leading positive contributor to the nation's trade balance.    Deep U.S. government involvement in exports of some commodities, such as wheat, is fostering a dependence upon subsidies among foreign buyers that isn't likely to disappear soon, analysts say.    At the same time, shipments of major Farm Belt commodities such as corn and wheat, which powered the farm-export surge of the 1970s, continue to decline in value on a depressed world market.    As a result, any full recovery of U.S. farm exports &quot;is going to be a long drawn-out process,&quot; says W. Gene Wilson, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.    For the year ending Sept. 30, the Agriculture Department predicts the first increase in total farm-export volume in seven years, to 127.5 million metric tons, up 16% from the previous year. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.    However, while the value of shipments abroad should rise 5% to $27.5 billion, that still will be 37% less than 1981's record $43.9 billion.    The brightest spot in the export picture may be California, which overtook such traditional powerhouses as Illinois and Iowa in 1985 and apparently will continue to lead other agricultural states in farm exports this year. Shipments of California fruit, vegetables, cotton and other agricultural commodities are expected to hold firm at $2.8 billion this year, contributing about 11% of total sales abroad.    In addition, a generous government trade-boosting program has turned one of California's principal exports, cotton, into a trade juggernaut. Projected exports of U.S. cotton are expected to more than triple this year to 6.7 million bales, the Agriculture Department says, while their value roughly will have doubled. Under the program, the government compensates U.S. farmers for selling cotton at low world market prices.    Meanwhile, Washington's increasingly costly involvement in U.S. food trade is fostering a growing international dependence on commodity subsidies. U.S. wheat exports, for instance, have become inextricably linked to government subsidy programs.    This year, 90% of new wheat sales occurred only through the government's so-called export enhancement program, says Raymond Daniel, an economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Under that program, the government compensates grain merchants for selling relatively high-priced U.S. wheat at lower world prices.    Last year, the program -- coupled with two other export-boosting initiatives, foreign food -- aid programs and government loan guarantees to foreign buyers -- accounted for almost two-thirds of all wheat exports, says Daniel Basse, an analyst at GNP Commodities Inc. in Chicago.    While such programs are boosting sales, they also encourage reliance on government aid. &quot;It's going to be that much more difficult to wean our customers off the program&quot; in the future, says Richard Loewy, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.    At the same time, the U.S.'s leading competitors -- the Common Market, Brazil and Argentina -- also subsidize most grain sales, continually pushing more supply onto the market. The persistent surplus in turn keeps prices low.    As a result, the value of U.S. corn, wheat and soybean exports -- which together will account for almost 70% of farm-export volume this year -- continues to skid, despite increases in the volume of corn and wheat sales.    While the volume of corn shipments is expected to rise 22% from last year, the dollar value should drop about 9%, the Agriculture Department says. Dollar sales of wheat are likely to shrink 6%, despite an 18% increase in volume.    Soybean exports are expected to decline in volume as well as value. There has been a recent spurt in sales because Brazil, the U.S.'s principal competitor in world soybean markets, overestimated the size of the crop it harvested recently and wasn't able to meet all its export commitments, Mr. Loewy says. Nevertheless, the Agriculture Department is predicting a decline in U.S. soybean exports in the year ending Sept. 30, 1988, which would be the second drop in a row. </TEXT></DOC>
