Rep. Les Aspin, the Democratic chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee, said ``the president should be congratulated''for the plan, outlined in a State of the Union address.   ``Trying to negotiate lower limits on forces deployed in Europeis clearly a good idea,'' said the Wisconsin Democrat.   Said Dole: ``The ball is now in (Soviet leader Mikhail)Gorbachev's court.''   At the same time they were hailing his troop cut proposal,Democrats made plain their intention to battle with Bush over otherissues in the current election-year session of Congress.   In a nationally televised speech that served as the formalDemocratic response, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said his partywould work with the president ``wherever and whenever we can. Onsome issues, we will have difference because we care deeply aboutcertain principles,'' he said.   He scoffed at Bush's call for a ``meager'' 2 percent rise ineducation spending, and said Democrats would battle theadministration this year on legislation dealing with capital gainstaxes, child care and clean air. As for abortion, he said, ``Wewill continue to defend a woman's right to choose, for we areconvinced that politicians cannot and should not attempt to makethe choice.''   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri faultedBush for not being ``more specific about how he intends tostrengthen our economy and lift the economic fortunes of people whowork for a living.''   Republicans applauded Bush's statement that the ``last thing weneed to do is mess around with Social Security,'' with GOP HouseWhip Newt Gingrich of Georgia saying the president's position ``isgoing to be clearly the only acceptable political position _ sayingthat nothing affecting benefits can be considered.''   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., in an attempt to block thegovernment from using surplus Social Security taxes, has proposedrolling back a tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and to reduceanother increase scheduled for next year.   Following the speech, Moynihan said despite Bush's promise notto fool with Social Security, ``They're messing around (with SocialSecurity) where they're using the trust fund as general revenue.''   Overall, Dole called Bush's speech ``an optimistic `can do'State of the Union, which advances a hope agenda, one in sharpcontrast with the Democrat's nope agenda.''   But House Democratic Whip William Gray, D-Pa., said Bush'sspeech ``ought to be introduced to his budget. There's adisconnect.''   But domestic issues aside, lawmakers on both sides of the aislechorused their praise of Bush's proposal to reduce troops in theso-called ``Central Front'' in Europe to 195,000 for eachsuperpower.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the SenateArmed Services Committee, said Bush ``skillfully seized the elementof surprise and thereby seized the opportunity to put the UnitedStates back into the forefront of negotiations to reduceconventional forces.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said the reduction plan ``makes the arms controlproposal that we have on the table much more relevant to thechanging circumstances in Europe and also much more in keeping withsome of our fiscal pressures.''   Earlier in the day, Foley told reporters he ``would welcome asuggestion that we could make further troop cuts in Europe.''   ``I don't think the United States should totally withdraw fromWestern Europe, but very substantial reductions are not onlypossible, but I think inevitable,'' he said.   Bush's proposal is a response to the tumultuous changes inEastern Europe, where the push for democracy has led to thedownfall of hardline Communist regimes.   One longtime advocate of reduced U.S. troops in Europe, Rep.Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said she was ``delighted'' with theplan. ``There's hope,'' Schroeder said.   ``Just when you thought you had a Cold War budget _ boom,'' saidSchroeder, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.   Aspin coupled his praise with a caution: ``We should be carefulin this whole process not to give the Soviet Union a reason to keepmore troops in Eastern Europe than it would without an agreement.For both sides it should be a ceiling, not a floor.''   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said Bush ``is rushing to catch thereality of Eastern Europe.''   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the United States was``falling behind the curve of popular will'' on the issue of troopreductions.   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee and the Democratic Caucus' point-man on defense,questioned the absence of a military strategy from theadministration.   ``It was unwise to build up on military strength in the 1980'swithout a national strategy. But it is even more dangerous to builddown without one,'' McCurdy said.   Dole defended the president as a middle-of-the-road president.   ``Ultra liberals and ultra conservatives may not like tonight'sspeech, which tells me George Bush is right in step with theAmerican people,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
