Would you believe a bold new attempt to break the record for the world's longest conga line?    In recent months, conga-record breaking has become serious business, tainted with fierce rivalry and maybe even espionage, all for one sweet goal: a spot in the 1988 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records.&quot;    The race heated up about three weeks ago, when 10,442 people shuffled into a line at the Edmonton Heritage Festival in Alberta, Canada, aiming to break the previous record of 8,659, set in 1982 in Great Britain. It took two hours to put the Canadian line together, for a conga that lasted nine minutes.    Among the revelers, however, were two alleged spies -- who are now behind an attempt to break the record they just helped set. They will use their new-found conga skills to guide a horde of challengers tomorrow on the Royal Gorge Bridge in southern Colorado.    Lorraine Payne, who helped arrange the line in Edmonton, claims she saw the men looking for potential snags and taking photographs at her event. Nevertheless, she professes good will. &quot;I wish them all the luck in the world,&quot; she says. &quot;But they'll need massive coordination.&quot;    Ben Hart, one of the two men in question, maintains that he started planning the Royal Gorge event in early March, well before the Canadian attempt: &quot;It was strictly coincidental. We had no idea about the Edmonton line until it happened.&quot;    Nor does he have any doubt of success. &quot;There's no question in my mind we can do it,&quot; says Mr. Hart, who is marketing director of Royal Gorge Co., which operates the bridge's tourist facilities. &quot;We're expecting 14,000 people -- at least.&quot; He explains that the 1,260-foot bridge will safely hold about 3,600 dancers; the rest will spill over into the parking lot.    To break the record, the dancers will have to follow certain rules, says David Hoy, managing director of the record book's editorial offices in Middlesex, England. At least 10,443 people will have to actually dance -- hands on hips to a syncopated Latin rhythm -- and the line will have to remain unbroken. &quot;And if they can get the whole lot moving for 30 seconds,&quot; Mr. Hoy adds, &quot;they just might do it.&quot;    Should the challengers surpass the record, it's unlikely that the Canadian conga contingent will rest on its laurels. &quot;If they break it,&quot; Ms. Payne vows, &quot;we'll come back next year. That's a promise.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
