 Another interesting development was the cooperationbetween vendors that resulted in the presence of some vendors' output devicesin as many as a dozen different booths.andM;As usual, we are trying to save space by not reporting on vendors that showedbasically the same equipment as we had seen at another recent event, such asType-X, the Seybold Seminars or America East.andP;  But we don't want readers tothink that these vendors didn't exhibit, so we will mention here thatLInotype howed its range of output devices and Compugraphic similarlydemonstrated its family of imagesetters, but without any new developments.andO;Camex added PostScript capabilities to its SuperSetter, but it remains asystem product, not a PostScript machine for non-Camex customers, so commentsabout it appear under &quot;Large systems.&quot; CPS brought the Chelgraph line that itsells, but the main news in the booth regarded its front end, so we have notincluded CPS here.andP;  One-for-One, similarly, had nothing new on the outputfront, so our coverage appears under &quot;Small systems.&quot;andM;Summary.andP;  To assist readers in gaining an overview of this section, thefollowing brief summaries of our coverage may be helpful:andM;Autologic demonstrated the Bidco 80C recorder for color output and showed forthe first time the ability to rasterize PostScript graphics and output themon pages using Autologic's GICL command language.andP;  Also new was an interfaceto the Hell Pressfax transmission device.andM;Bidco made quite a hit with its FrontPage 80C recorder for color separationfilms.andP;  It didn't show die 60-inch-per-minute recordcr that had beenannounced last year.andM;Birmy made a move toward higher performance by introducing a twin RIP thatenables two PostScript processors to feed data to onc recorder.andP;  Birmy alsoadded a spooling capability to its systems.andM;Chemco Technologies, now concentrating on consumables, introduced ncw photomaterial for laser diode imagesetters.andM;CyberVision, one of the new exhibitors at die show, demonstrated animpressive CCD scanner that is being designed to handle color as well asmonochrome images, although the latter was all that was shown.andP;  This is thesame company that brought a new display ad system.andM;Du Pont exhibited a wide-format recorder for its Highlight system.andP;  Like thenarrow one, this one is based on a Linotype imaging engine.andP;  But it uses acustomized Linotronic 500 supporting a full 2540-dpi resolution, rather thanthe 1800 maximum of the standard L500.andM;ECRM's main attraction was the PetBox 3000, which supports higher resolutionand greater accuracy than earlier PelBox units.andP;  Also in the booth was a PCversion of the buffered SCSI interface already offered for Macintoshes.andM;Electra Products, a U.S.andP;  distributor of Chelgraph RIPs, imagers and graphicsystems, showed the full lineup, induding the PostScript machine that madeits debut at IPEX last fall but hadn't been seen in the U.S.andP;  previously.andM;Graphic Enterprises displayed a new optical module for its PageScan family ofplain-paper recorders.andP;  The new version uses a helium-neon laser and ahologram optical subsystem instead of an Ultre unit based on a laser diodeimaging on a copier drum.andM;Hyphen made clear its &quot;arrival&quot; in the market by appearing in 12 differentbooths.andP;  It also showed some minor enhancements and reported some U.S.andO;sales.andM;Information International unveiled a high-resolution version (up to 2,400dpi) of its 3800 imagesetter and a page facsimile system that uses the 3800and a modified 3700 scanner.andM;Lennane Advanced Devices showed significant progress since last year inproducing a high-speed PostScript RIP that is pegged to come in at half theprice of last year's unit, although we wonder if the price ($100,000) stillisn't too high.andP;  It is in beta testing, though.andM;Microcrafts has a dual-function translator for Compugraphic users: convert CGcode to PostScript to print on any PostScript machine or convert PostScriptto CG code to drive a Compugraphic typesetter.andM;Monotype was highlighting its ability to output color separations and its newSeries 3 RIP on the Express imagesetter, but most of the news had beencovered in our previous issue, which featured Monotype, so our report onMonotype at ANPA is briefandM;Printware demonstrated its PostScript printer and platesetter, with a newwrinkle on the latter device: the ability to print proofs on plain paper.andM;Ricoh is now offering an large-format ImagiTex scanner as the Telepress 110.andO;It also introduced a network controller intended handling a variety of inputand output recorders in a remote publishing environment.andM;Sinclair Communications brought the Hasselblad scanner that it seUsexclusively in the U.S., plus the Monotype Picture Post, sold in the U.S.andP;  asthe Photo Image Processing System.andP;  Both have been given some Macintoshcompatibility.andM;StarSignal demonstrated a color fax machine that can transmit a page anywherein the world in four minutes, using a 100:1 compression algorithm.andP;  Acomplete system, consisting of a scanner and Tektronix thermal-transfer colorprinter at each end, costs almost $26,000.andM;3M brought the latest effort in dry-silver processing, with probably its besteffort yet, although it is aimed only at printing proofs from negatives, notat typesetting applications.andP;  The company's digital color proofer wasn'tdemonstrated but is being prepared for Drupa, we believe.andM;TwinSys, with the expert guidance of nearly-lost-but-not-fotgotten TimColdwell, showed up at the last minute with its European-designed fax system.andO;Using a CCD scanner and an Ultre recorder, it is priced much lower than diefax systems of die large vendors.andM;Ultre combined with Next to demonstrate the NextSetter, but it wasn'tgenerating much in die way of output because of Next's lack of software todrive devices at resolutions higher than 400 dpi.andM;Varityper, which is making strides to create one happy family composed of itsown product line and that of Tegra, had a good show.andP;  Not only did itrenumber aB of the Tegra products, but it surprised most people with alarge-foffnat Canon printer (24&quot;x 13 feet) outputting PostScript files at 800d i (to be increased to 1,000 dpi by the time ofrelease).andP;  Also notable wasthe PostScript Compatible Interface now available for the Tegra line.andM;Xerox demonstrated a Macintosh interface for its popular 7650 scanner, whichis being ,SSold by Locker in addition to Xerox's normal channels.andM;Xitron announced support for AppleTalk and for die Chelgraph logo scanner forits family of XIP plain-papcr output devices, which are finding a niche inthe VideoSetterreplacement market.andP;  Xitron also reported a service agreementunder which Dow Jones wiU provide support for Xitron customers.andM;Autologic refines PS-PIP and AGIandM;The major new developments from Autologic were color output from the APS-6/80and a high-speed, large-format proofer using a Versatec electrostaticplotter.andP;  But the real focus was die ongoing refinement of the product line,including die PostScript PS-PIP and the AGI (Autologic Graphics Integrator),which together will integrate PostScript files and Autologic files on thesame page.andP;  The AGI, of course, also combines graphics from a wide range ofdifferent inputs into pages.andM;To show the completeness of the system integration, die whole Autologic standwas ringed with an Ethernet cable that linked all devices in the booth.andO;Graphics from Macintoshes and PCs were sent to the AGI, from which they couldbe output on any of the output devices: a range of laser printers at 300 and600 dpi (the Printware engine), the 400-dpi Versatec, or APS-6/80 orAPS-6/108 units.andM;Handling PostScript.andP;  With the AGI's new capabilities, Autologic's handlingof PostScript becomes quite interesting.andP;  As readers may recall, the PS-PIPconsists of two small cabinets--one with an Adobe Adas Plus RIP and one withspecialpurpose hardware and firmware accompanied by substantial RAM.andP;  TheAtlas board supports AppleTalk and RS-232 input.andP;  Output is to the APS-55 PIPmultiplexer.andM;Input and output are set up through a dialog on the monitor.andP;  The PS-PIPworks in much the same fashion as the APS55 PIP in that the total image israsterized into RAM before it is output.andP;  The amount of memory supportedwithin the PSPIP depends upon the resolution and size of images to be output;it can be 16, 32 or 48 MB.andM;After an image has been rasterized, it can be stored on the disk of thePS-PIP, sent to the AGI for subsequent inclusion in a page with text andimages in the GICL language, or sent direcdy to one of the imagers.andP;  If it isstored on disk, it can be in uncompressed form, packed as a compressed TIFFimage, or stored as an Autologic GM2 line art file.andP;  The PS-PIP is linked viaEthernet to its output units.andM;ANPA was the first showing of the total integration of PostScript, which isnow deliverable to customers.andM;Color output.andP;  One new development was color output from the APS-6/80, whichuses the new Bidco FrontPage 80C recorder introduced at this show (seeBidco).andP;  Autologic was outputting complete pages as four separations, withthe APS800SX PIP handling the screening of the four angles via its hardwareboard.andP;  This is an extension of the current monochrome facility, enablinghandling of resolution-independent color screening angles.andM;In the booth, graphics were input from an Itek color scanner linked to theAGI via an interface developed for Autologic by the UK developer HighwaterDesigns.andP;  Input was also coming from a Barneyscan scanner linked to aMacintosh generating a TIFF file.andP;  Barneyscan is working on a direct linkageto the AGI, where it will create Autologic's GM4 contone format directly.andM;Lane-format proofer.andP;  One of Autologic's highlights was the new, high-speedVersatec proofer that was driven from a PIP.andP;  This 36-inch-wide device runsat 60 inches per minute at a resolution of 400 dpi.andP;  The cost works out toapproximately 15 cents per page.andP;  The quality of output is quite respectable.andO;(Autologic used this capability to decorate the walls of the booth withfull-page output.andM;Actually, pages were large than full; Autologic output 1,000-dpi images tothe 400-dpi unit, which, in turn, would output a broadsheet page with a widthof 36 inches.)andM;We see potential for this device not only for proofing, but also forproducing large newspaper sales posters directly from the system.andM;Fax interface.andP;  Autologic introduced a new interface to die Hell Pressfax,linking the APS-5 5 to the Hell fax unit.andP;  On die stand, the link included aRicoh Telepress 35 network server, which was taking rasterized data into acommunications link to drive an imaging unit at a remote location.andM;Autologic also showed the ability to use an Autologic imager for output fromthe Pressfax.andP;  In this situation, the APS PIP and thc PS-PIP are connected tothe Autologic output multiplexer, which is linked to the Pressfax, which isconnected to, for example, the Telepress 35.andP;  The Telepress 35 thean handiesdata compression and communications at speeds of up to 2 megabits per second(Europe) or 1.5 megabits per second (U.S.).andM;At the remote site, the data is received by another Ricoh TP35, from which itgoes into an Autologic Pressfax interface, which again is connected to anAutologic output multiplexer, which, of course, can be connected to differentAutologic PIPS and imagers.andM;Status.andP;  All of the products being shown were delverable, but one AGIfunction-the ability to send and receive lowresolution graphic images betweenthe AGI and a front-end system-isn't expected to be ready to be shipped untilSeptember.andP;  This fimction will enable the front-end system to scale and cropimages at low resolution, then send these changes back to the AGI, where theywill be applied to the high-resolution image.andP;  It will not, however, includeimage rotation.andM;Autologic also reported an increase in the percentage of its shipments goingto international markets, saying that 50% of aU shipments of its products aregoing to Europe.andP;  The company also said its profits are increasing at anexcellent rate, although no details were disclosed.andM;Bidco wades into color businessandM;The main development being shown by Bidco was the ncw FrontPage 80C unit forimaging color separation films.andP;  This is an improved version of the FrontPage80, which has been used by Autologic in its APS-6 and by Camex in itsSuperSetter.andP;  The main change is an improved film transport to provide theaccuracy needed for color work.andM;There are no changes to the system's optics, which means it is possible toupgrade a FrontPage 80 unit to an 80C by changing the film transportmechanism.andM;Like the ECRM PelBoxes, the FrontPage 80C is not a stop/start machine, so theRIP must be able to generate data in a continuous mode.andP;  We were advised thatthe produces specification calls for an accuracy of three mils (thousandthsof an inch) over eight feet when a power take-up cassette is used.andP;  Thismeasurement is radically different from the specifications of ECRM andMonotype, which are four mils over 12 or 10 inches.andM;We believe also that these vendors have fundamentally different approaches todefining accuracy.andP;  Our understanding is that Bidco means that if pages aretaken from each end of an eight-foot roll of film, the difference in pagesize will not exceed three mils.andP;  ECRM and Monotype, on the other hand, meanthat the differences between any two pages within a full 200-foot roll offilm will be four mils.andP;  Perhaps only a comparative test will show which ofthese is more accurate.andM;The new color unit also was shown on the Autologic stand, where it wasproducing attractive newspaper-qua output.andP;  There will also be a FrontPage100C-a 100-pica color product.andM;The 60-inch/minutc machine? At last year's show, Bidco announced a60-inch-per-minute version of the FrontPage with a 108-pica width.andP;  This wasnot shown at ANPA, but we were told that it will be demonstrated as a productat IFRA in October.andP;  We were also advised that Bidco is working on machineswith resolutions higher than the current 1,000 dpi.andP;  These may be unveiled inthe third quarter of 1989.andM;OEM deals.andP;  The other development was a new OEM agreement with Berthold U.S.andO;to sell the recorders.andP;  Berthold in Germany is ECRMs largest customer andwill be taking the new PelBox 3000.andP;  We are not sure of die rationale behindthe Bidco/Berthold agreement, but Bidco emphasized that it is solely for theU.S.andP;  market.andM;Birmy shows spooler, twin RIPandM;Birmy Graphics focused on higher performance through the use of both a new X2twin-RIP machine and a Queue Station for spooling.andP;  It also demonstratedcolor output from the BirmySetter.andM;The X2, an enhancement to the current Birmy PostScript Rip, allows two jobsto be rasterized simultaneously.andP;  Each RIP is an identical 80386-basedcomputer with eight megabytes of memory, with a 330-MB SCSI hard disk and ashared 100-MB drive for spooling.andM;Birmy is offering several different connectivity options.andP;  Each RIP can beconnected to a different PostScript output device, so that jobs can beprepared simultaneously for, say, a film and a plain-paper device.andP;  Or it canbe dually ported to a single imagesetter.andM;If only one setter is used, it will be sent the next available job,downloaded from either Rip.andP;  In this way, Birmy is proposing that two of thefour color-separation pages can be rasterized at thc same time.andP;  Naturally,the savings in this area come about when pages normally take much longer tobe rasterized than to be imaged, a situation dependent on the complexity ofthc PostScript file and on the amount of work that the interpreter has to do.andO;For most cases, however, this arrangement appears to add a great deal ofspeed at a relatively small price.andM;The Queue Station-a PC that connects to either one RIP or two (in die case ofthe X2)-allows jobs to be directed from the user's Mac or PC workstation tothe X2.andP;  If both Rips arc busy, the job will be automatically spooled andtaken by the next available RIP.andM;How much difference do the spooling system and die second RIP make mthroughput? Birmy claims that a standard BirmySetter Rip runs at around thesame speed as a Linotype REP III, but the output unit is slower atresolutions equivalent to Linotypes units.andP;  The use of two Rips does notnecessarily make a major speed improvement, since a total job wiU have to besent to a single Rip before output of each page can commence.andP;  It is notpossible to switch from one RIP to the other at the end of each page becausePostScript, unlike the Interpress and DDL page description languages, doesnot resct all its variables at the start of each page, and subsequent pagesrely on setups from a previous page or pages.andM;The 70-pica dual-Rip machine costs $54,500.andP;  The upgrade for currentBirmySetter users costs around $20,000.andM;Chemco Technologies' new materialsandM;Chemco Technologies focused on some new photographic materials, although italso showed quite a variety of hardware.andP;  On hand were samples of a newinfrared film and paper for laser diode devices, such as the Linotype 200Pimagesetter that was on the stand.andP;  The new paper gives sharper imagequality.andP;  The company also is developing a film and a paper for LED devices,especially those of Matsushita.andM;The NewsScan facsimile transmission system was shown, with no new featuresbut with a new order to report from die St Louis Sun, a new newspaper due tobegin publication in a couple of months.andP;  Also exhibited were a Reuterspicture desk running on a Macintosh, the Hyphen RIP and an Autokon 1000.andM;CyberVision unveils scannerandM;In addition to the Advance display ad workstation covered earlier,CyberVision unveiled its DC 5000 scanner, which is still under developmentand will handle both monochrome and color images.andP;  It uses a CCD arraymounted on a screw thread on an enlarger-type pedestal over a copy board.andO;Illumination is provided by two 1000-watt light sources.andM;A filter wheel, to be controlled by software, wiU be used to handle color.andM;The system was linked to a Sun workstation that was used for scanner controland image manipulation.andM;The DC 5000 first carries out a prescan, which is displayed on the Sun'smonitor.andP;  The area to be scanned is then defined, and the enlargement is madeby adjusting the position of the scanner head on the pedestal.andP;  Normallyscaling of the image would occur on input, but the software in the Sun alsoallows for image scaling and rotation.andM;The system appeared promising; we look forward to seeing furtherdevelopments, especially in color.andM;Du Pont highlights wider outputandM;Du Pont introduced a wider version of its Highlight system for scanning andrecording images.andP;  Like the original Highlight, thc new model is based on anImagiTex scanner and an OEM version of the 1986, has now been installed inabout 50 sites, Du Pont said, induding more in the U.andP;  S.andP;  than elsewhere.andM;The new version uses the same large-format ImagiTex unit (five 4,000-clementCCD arrays), but it uses a model of the Linotronic 500 instead of the 300.andO;It is interesting that the wide-measure recorder Du Pont is using supportsthe full 2,540-dpi resolution of the 300, in contrast to Linotype's own 500model, which produces a maximum resolution of 1,700 dpi.andM;Du Pont didn't announce pricing of the new machine but said it would be about$37,000 more than the narrower-output Highlight.andM;ECRM on the color bandwagonandM;The principal announcement from ECRM was a new, highresolution output unit,the PelBox 3000.andP;  This is a switchableresolution unit, with a maximumresolution of 3,000 dpi.andM;Several major enhancements have been made to previous PelBox products toallow for the higher resolution and for a higher quality of output that isneeded for handling process color.andP;  These improvements are in both the opticsand the film transport.andM;In optics, the unit continues to use a galvanometer instead of a spinner forbeam deflection.andP;  It is a resonant &quot;galvo&quot; with a very low cross-axiswobble-in other words, no measurable wobble.andP;  It also has twice the scanspeed of the galvo on the standard 72-pica PelBox.andM;The new film-handling mechanism in the PelBox 3000 changes the motor drivesystem from a stepper motor to a DC servo unit.andP;  ECRM claims that at certainspeeds stepper motors may generate resonance, which can affect quality.andP;  Thespeed of the DC motor can be constantly measured and adjusted to ensure thecorrect level of accuracy.andP;  The drive mechanism uses an encoder system thatcontrols the film's pull rollers to ensure accurate film feed.andM;When we asked whether the changes made for the PelBox 3000 would also beapplicable to the 108-pica PelBox units, ECRM said that these machinesalready had a comparable galvo, and that an improved film transport iscoming.andM;ECRM also showed a SCSI interface on a PC card plus the relevant controlsoftware to permit a PC to operate in the same fashion as a Macintosh withthc Autokon buffered SCSI interface.andP;  This will be available in the thirdquarter.andM;Electra shows CheigraphPelBoxandM;Electra, a U.S.andP;  distributor for Chelgraph products, showed the Chelgraph IBX1000L running with die ECRM PelBox 108S output unit and the Chelgraph Riprunning with its Postscript add-on board.andP;  We first saw Chelgraph'sPostScript implementation at IPEX last year, but this was the first time wehad seen it with the high-speed ECRM output unit.andM;Electra also demonstrated the Chelgraph LCGS graphic system and the A3-sized400-dpi proofer.andP;  The new 600-dpi Chelgraph A3 unit that uses the Copalengine wasn't running, but Electra did have impressive samples of its output,andM;Graphic Enterprises using Holotek unitandM;Graphic Enterprises has added a new plain-paper printer, the PageScan 3, toits line of large-forms proofers.andP;  Like the PageScan 2, the new machineoffers variable resolution and prints on 18&quot; x 24&quot; paper.andP;  However, it uses adifferent laser beam system and provides greater speed.andM;The PageScan 2, you may recall, is basically the optical system of an Ultrefilm recorder that has been reworked to expose a copier drum instead of film.andO;The Ultre uses a spinning mirror to sweep a light beam across the image area.andO;The spinning mirror puts a speed limit on the scan rate; die PageScan 2 cango up to 176 scan lines per second.andP;  At its full rated resolution of 1,000dpi, the PageScan 2 can print about 1 1/2 pages a minute.andM;Hologon optics.andP;  The new PageScan 3 uses an optical subsystem supplied byHolotek.andP;  Rather than a spinning mirror, Holotek uses a patented spinninghologram to sweep the beam across the image.andP;  (The hologram is an opticalinterference pattern; it is photographically recorded on a glass disk.andP;  Thepattern is similar to the diffraction gratings embossed on plastic that youcan see at a novelty store, only at microscopic scale.) Rather than beingreflected, the beam is diffracted by passing through the hologram.andP;  Holotekcalls the beam deflection system a hologon, a contraction of hologram andpolygon.andM;According to Holotek, this technique yields a major advantage: any wobble inthe mechanism (due to slack in the bearings, for example) is largelyself-canceling, whereas wobble in mirror systems is magnified.andP;  Thus mirrorsystems must use motors and bearings of the highest precision (and cost),while holographic systems can get good results with rather ordinarycomponents.andM;Compugraphic is Holotek's only other announced customer; die 9600 imagesetteruses the hologram beam deflection mechanism.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  16, No.andP;  3, page 28for more about Holouk's technology.) Several other firms are said to bedeveloping hologram- based products, but they have not made anyannouncements.andM;The optical system used in the PageScan 3 is specified to work over a widerange of speeds, from 100 scan lines per second up to 1,200 scans per second.andO;The recording resolution can be varied from 300 dpi to 1,000 dpi.andP;  Paperspeed can go up to 5 pages a minute.andM;Graphic Enterprises wiU be selling the machine for use at 800 dpi, but at theshow it was supporting only 600-dpi output.andP;  The company attributed this toRIPS, which makes the PostScript RIP, stating that the memory cache hadn'tbeen increased to support 800 dpi in time for ANPA.andM;Emulations.andP;  In manufacturing the PageScan 3, Graphic Enterprises kept thesame Canon video interface as in the current Ultre- based PageScan 2.andP;  (It isalso the interface used in several low- cost laser printers.) Thus thecustomer has the same choice of raster controllers for the PageScan 3 as forthe PageScan 2.andM;However, Graphic Enterprises points out that the Holotek optical system iscapable of addressability beyond 3,000 dpi.andP;  (The optical system can resolvethe smaller dots and higher data rates, but the photocopier drum and tonerlimit the overaU system resolution.) Thus it would be possible to makeinterfaces that emulate other vendors' recording engines; one could pick offthe video from, say, a Monotype or Autologic RIP, reconstruct the sync pulsesand use die signal in the PageScan.andP;  This process would give a dot-for-dotplain-paper proof print, and the user wouldn't need to pay for an additionalRIP, or even for a modification of the existing Rip.andM;Graphic Enterprises is careful to point out that this is still just aninteresting possibility and not a product.andP;  There are no current plans tomarket die device this way.andM;Positioning.andP;  The PageScan 3 is an addition to the Graphic Enterprisesproduct line, not a replacement for the PageScan 2.andP;  Graphic Enterprises doessell directly to end users, but it prefers to make OEM arrangements withother vendors.andP;  The PageScan 2 is priced at die $ 30,000 level.andM;The final price for the PageScan 3 has not been determined.andP;  However, GraphicEnterprises intends to price die PageScan 3 in such a way that there will betwo distinct PageScan products.andP;  It believes that a price difference in theneighborhood of $5,000 will be appropriate in view of the speed difference,but it may modify -that policy if it leads to a blurring of productdistinctions.andP;  The PageScan 3 will have the advantage of higher speed, butsince it uses the same copier technology, it will probably offer no betterquality.andM;Both PageScan units are being touted as plain-paper proofers, not asfinal-output imagesetters.andP;  But from samples we've seen from the PageScan 2,we think there is a range of applications for which the quality may be goodenough for final output.andP;  Newspaper publishers might consider it for papersprinted on ordinary newsprint, but we doubt that the quality is sufficientfor anything that will be printed on better stock.andM;Hyphen on the move in U.S.andM;Although the size of one's profile isn't always a good indication of success,Hyphen certainly has managed to move quickly into a position of prominence inthe industry.andP;  It probably outdid any of the traditional vendors of outputdevices in terms of the number of locations in which its products could beviewed on the show floor.andP;  The Hyphen PostScript RIP was operating in 12booths at the show, including Hyphen's own stand, where it was running in aMacintosh II driving a Graphic Enterprises proofer and an Ultra recorder.andP;  Italso was running on Hyphen's own hardware Rip driving a PelBox 108S.andM;New product developments were minor.andP;  Most notable was the ability to run theRIP on a LocalTalk network in the same manner as other devices, with any userable to access it from the Chooser menu.andM;Sales activities.andP;  On the sales front, Hyphen has appointed a national salesmanager (Bill Hayes, who had spent seven years at Compugraphic and two yearsat Xyvision) and three dealers: one each in New York City, Florida and St.andO;Louis.andP;  Most of its sales so far have been Macintosh-based RIPs driving Ultrerecorders, but three Hyphen hardware RIPs have been sold in the U.S.andP;  TheHyphen RIP driving an ECRM PelBox 108S (24&quot;/minute) seUs for $120,000.andP;  The72-pica Ultre vasion costs $26,000, not including the Macintosh, but indudingthe Siclone accelerator card that runs in the Mac; the 94pica machine costs$39,000.andM;Worldwide, Hyphen says it has sold 33 of the Mac-Ultre configurations.andP;  Itsintemational sales effort includes setting up operations in Scandinavia,France, Australia and Korea.andM;Triple-I: higher-resolution 3800, faxandM;Information International, which may have had more new developments (most ofwhich are covered elsewhere in this report) than any other vendor, unveiled ahigher-resolution version of its 3800 laser imagesetter, the 3800/HR.andP;  Italso announced its move into being a supplier of high-resolution facsimilesystems for both the color .newspaper and magazine markets.andM;The 3800/HR, which outputs pages at resolutions of between 1,600 and 2,400dpi at sizes up to 12 x 24 indies, has a halftone dot generator that cangenerate aU screen angles for color.andP;  Fonts for die unit can be from thestandard Triple-I library or from Bitstream.andM;The new facsimile system uses the 3800 or 3800/HR imagesetters.andP;  The inputscanner is a modified 3700 unit caUed the 3750, which can scan at up to 2,400lines per inch.andP;  This scanner can handle both transmission and reflectivecopy, and it has dynamic thresholding to improve image quality.andM;The scanner is linked to a Sun workstation as its controller, which isconnected via Ethernet network to a Network commander.andP;  The Commander isanother Sun workstation that contains a communications control card forhandling lines of up to Tl specification (1.5 megabits/sec.).andP;  The NetworkCommander also handles multidimensional data compression.andM;At the other end of the facsimile network is a second Network Commanderlinked to a 3800 imagesetter.andP;  The system can handle both scanned pages andsymbolic drive data in Triple-I format, and it can handle pre-screened imagesof up to 180-line screens.andP;  Triple-I claims that the facsimile system iscompetitive in price with Crosfield's PageFax and less expensive than Hell'sPressfax.andM;Lennane's RF Off and runningandM;Lennane Advanced Devices (separate from Lennane Advanced Products, which isdeveloping &quot;word publishing&quot; software for OS/2) demonstrated the currentstate of die high-speed PostScript RIP that was started when this company wasa subsidiary of System Integrators.andP;  Called the MetroScriptor, it was firstshown at ANPA in 1988, when it was mostly an indication of what was to come.andO;It is now in beta testing and appears to be considerably more complete thanit was last year.andP;  The beta site is a vendor.andM;Designed to drive either a Hell Pressfax or an ECRM 108S output unit, theMetroScriptor comists of a Fairchild Clipper RISC processor and at least one64-MB area of RAM, which I-ennane calls a Digital Mirror.andP;  A normal systemwould have two Digital Mirrors so a page could be rasterized as die previouspage was being output.andM;The Digital Mirror is used to store a page bitmap for broadsheet pages at upto 1,200 dpi.andP;  The system is claimed to be able to handle resolutions of upto 2,400 dpi, but this would require two Digital Mirrors for one broadsheetpage.andP;  In performance, we were quoted a time of approximately two minutes torasterize a broadsheet page at 1,016 dpi.andP;  The subsequent output time woulddepend on the engine driven, but with two Digital Mirrors, output would beconcurrent with input.andM;The PostScript interpreter software is provided by Custom Applications, Inc.andO;(CAI).andP;  When we saw die system last year, the price was pegged at about$200,000-which we felt was a bit steep.andP;  This year we were advised that theprice is around $100,000-stiU a somewhat expensive approach to thc problem ofhigh-speed PostScript, particularly in view of the equivalent or higherperformance available from Hyphen at a substantially lower cost.andM;Microcrafts outputs CG, PS codeandM;Microcrafts has developed a front-end, independent translator for outputtingPostScript on Compugraphic typesetters and CG code on PostScript devices.andO;Built around a 10-MHZ XT with an add-in board, the Translator II convertscodes from CG front ends to drive any PostScript device.andP;  Fonts can bedownloaded as required.andP;  One of its features is to allow a CG front end tooutput some PostScript data that may not bc included in the Compugraphic codeset.andM;Translator II costs from $3,470 to $5,000, depending on the system.andM;Monotype highlights color, Series 3andM;We covered most of the developments shown by Monotype in the previous issueof this Re&quot;, so there is little extra to say about what was shown at ANPA.andO;In our review of Monotype we referred to development work that was under wayto produce a higher-performance version of the Adobe Adas-based PostScriptRip.andM;This product was shown at ANPA, but it was just as a development unit toassess the reaction.andP;  Monotype has made a smaU number of these units, whichare currendy installed in a few sites for evaluation, but it isn't a productyet.andM;We saw some impressive speeds on these machines, but we didn't record anyofficial timings.andM;The unit was working as a twin-RIP device driving an Express output unit.andM;Monotype emphasized its ability to support color, including color screeningin the Rip, rather than sending color to die RIP as prescreened bitmaps.andO;Among the color units being demonstrated were die Itek 220 scanner and theSeeColor system.andM;The Monotype Series 11 graphic system was linked with a number of scanners.andO;One new scanner we had not seen before was from the new UK companyCyberVision, which is covered in its own section.andM;Of course, Monotype was highlighting the new Express Series 3, which wasoutputting complete pages at its full speed of 30 inches per minute.andM;Printware adds proofing to platesetterandM;Printware, whose first product was a 1200&quot;600-dpi laser printer, has beenfocusing lately on its 1440 Platesetter ES Series, which images onelectrostatic rollfed plates 15&quot; wide and up to 54' in length.andP;  It usesliquid toner.andP;  The REP is similar to that in the 7201Q printer except that itcomes with an 800-MB optical disc.andM;The new feature at ANPA was the ability to output plainpaper proofs from thePlatesetter.andM;Printware was claiming output speeds of ten full newspaper plates in fourminutes, combining REP and engine speeds.andM;The system has already been installed at Deluxe Cheque Printers, which hastwenty-five units now and expects to add another hundred.andP;  Printware wasquoting consumable costs of about $.34 per page.andM;Printware is selling the machine through direct channels and also announcedan OEM agreement with Multigraphics to sell the machine.andP;  It is priced ataround $50,000.andM;Ricoh offers network control systemandM;Ricoh brought two new products: a low-end network control system called theTelepress 15 and a flatbed scanner called the Telepress 110.andM;The scanner is a 110-pica (whence cometh the name) ImagiTex scanner,basically the familiar 18&quot; device ImagiTex introduced several years ago.andM;The Telepress 15 network controller is intended to provide control over avariety of input and output recorders (including its own Telepress 110) in aremote publishing environment.andP;  This unit is similar to its sophisticatedcousin, the Telepress 35.andP;  It buffers scanned pages while compressing them upto a 15:1 ratio (5:1 nominally).andM;It supports one input scanner and one local recorder with up to four remotereceivers.andP;  Its transmission speed can be up to 2.0 megabits/sec.andP;  It canscan and transmit single pages simultaneously with full error checking.andM;The input scheme can also directly accommodate rasterized PostScript filesinto its buffer.andM;The Telepress 15 rum under Windows in an enhanced PC with a nice userinterface.andP;  It allows the user to configure a network pictorially, attachingvarious input scanners to output recorders.andP;  It also dynamically shows areal- time snapshot of the condition of the entire transmission network,including all receive sites.andM;It uses up to 16 MB of internal memory to buffer scanned and compressed pageimages.andM;Pricing ranges from $25,000 to $35,000.andM;Sinclair shows Mac compatibilityandM;Sinclair Communications, which markets image transmission and facsimilesystems in the U.S., demonstrated the Hasselblad Dixel 2000 remote digitalscanner.andP;  It was shown with an image converter to bring up TIFF files in theMacintosh.andM;Sinclair announced that Express Newspapers Plc has ordered a Monotype PictureImaging Processing System (Picture Post in Europe) electronic picture desk,which Sinclair also handles in the U.S.andP;  At ANPA, it was interfaced to anAutokon 1000 for output and to a Macintosh.andM;StarSignal transmits color pagesandM;StarSignal sells a color facsimile machine, ColorFax, which can transmit an8.5&quot; x 11&quot; page anywhere in die world in four minutes.andP;  A Sharp JX300 scannerbrings die image into an AT specially equipped with compression boards, whichare also resident in die scanner.andP;  The image is compressed at 100:1 usingStarSignal's own compression routine and sent to the remote destination usinga built-in 1200-baud modem.andP;  Output is then to the Tektronix 4693DX four-pass300-dpi thermal-transfer printer.andM;Four color separations can also be processed with eight bits per color at thescanning end and 24 bits from the output device.andP;  The receive stationperforms decompression as the data comes into the system, go it is necessaryto have send and receive units at each location.andM;The system works on half-duplex analog lines and is recommended for proofingfor layout in advertising agencies and newspapers.andP;  It can store 2,000 stillimages on its 40-MB drivc and can also be used as a color copier.andM;ColorFax costs $25,900, complete with scanner and printer at two locations.andM;Also available was a new, high-resolution version of die system running on a'386 computer equipped with compression boards and the Vista capture boardusing a 1,024 x 728 screen, with output at 1,600 X 2,000, interpolated fromthe 300-dpi scan.andM;This system transmits 12 minutes per page.andP;  Color enhancement software withinterfaces to color electronic publishing systems is currently underdevelopment, as is the addition of a I-GB optical drive.andM;3M goes to the well againandM;If perseverance is a virtue, then 3M's engineers must be wrapped in glory.andO;They've stuck with the dry-silver photographic medium for more than a decade,improving it slowly along the way.andP;  It was featured prominently in the 3Mbooth, but, as at America East a year ago, not as a typesetting paper-a testit has never passed.andM;These days 3M is using dry-silver paper for contact proofing, where it isimpressive.andP;  (Another version using similar technology is employed by somewire services for printing photos.) Unlike the typesetting paper of yearsgone by, which displayed soft edges and couldn't be used as a satisfactorycamera-ready master, the latest version holds sharper edges and should serveweU for proofing.andP;  Whether it is useful for camera-ready art, as the companyalso daims, may depend on one's standards.andP;  We'll reproduce a sample here asa test.andM;The material, called Dry Contact Proof (DCP), is now being handled by thePrinting and Publishing System Division of 3M.andP;  It uses a heat-activatedprocess and isn't affected by daylight.andP;  It takes one minute from exposurethrough processing and, as its name suggests, it doesn't require anychemistry.andP;  The processor units come in two widths: 14&quot; ($1,300) and 26&quot;($2,200) .andP;  3M expects the end-user price of die material to be about $.67per square foot.andP;  The current effort is viewed as a test of the market, whichshould be concluded by thc end of this year.andM;We wondered if success in proofing might lead to another attempt in thetypesetting market.andP;  That isn't in the plan, we were told.andM;Not shown in the booth was the digital color proofing system 3M is workingon.andP;  It is still under development and is now expected to be given a debut atDrupa next spring.andM;TwinSys offers low-cost fax systemandM;TwinSys is a relatively new company, but we have seen it before: at dieScandinavian GIF conference in Denmark and at the Seybold European PublishingConference in the Netherlands.andP;  ANPA was its first showing outside of Europe.andM;The product is a low-cost newspaper facsimile transmission system that istargeted mainly at the smaller and middlesized newspapers that wish totransmit pages to a remote site.andP;  The unit uses TwinSys's own high-resolutionscanner that has three optically butted CCD arrays producing a 15,000-elementscan.andP;  Output is to an Ultre recorder running at 900 dpi.andP;  The other part ofthe system is a PC and Novell Netware-based communications network running atup to 2 megabits per second.andP;  This is the only system we have seen that has aPC running communications at these speeds.andM;The system operates with pages being scanned and stored in compressed form onthe file server.andP;  Other PCs on the network handle communications to remotesites.andP;  Because images are scanned to disk prior to communication, it is easyfor a remote site to request a retransmission of a page without disturbingthe scanning process when there are multiple output  sites.andM;TwinSys claims that one of its complete systems costs less than one-third asmuch as an equivalent configuration from Hell or Crosfield.andM;An interesting sidelight to TwinSys's appearance at ANPA was seeing TimColdwell, ex-Xenotron, who is acting in an advisory role in marketing theproduct and in funding the expansion of the company and continued developmentof thc product.andM;Ultre's Next trick awaits softwareandM;Ultre output units were in use in a number of booths, but in the company'sown exhibit it was only outputting test patterns.andP;  The reason was that theconfiguration, called the NestSetter, was lacking the appropriate software.andM;The NextSetter is an Ultre recorder interfaced to a Next computer, where theRIP'ing is done in the Next unit.andP;  It was only outputting test patternsbecause there is no output software yet.andP;  Apparently the problem is that thePostScript software in the Next computer is limited to outputting at 400dpi-the resolution of die Next printer.andP;  Ultre is believed to be indiscussion with Next to enable the recorder to be driven at all its resolutions.andM;Varityper: large format and PostScriptandM;Varityper, which is renaming its Tegra products to fit die mold establishedby the Varityper fine, added a large-format recording engine to its lineupand demonstrated a PostScript interpreter for the Tegra units.andM;People familiar with the former numbering scheme may have a hard time gettingused to the new one, but it gives the two product lines a common namingstructure.andP;  Formerly, Tegra devices were called either XM (outputting onphotographic materials) or XP (imaging on plain paper).andP;  There were two XMs,the 72 and the 108, whose numbers came from the maximum output width.andP;  Therewere two XPs, the 800 and the 1000, whose numbers came from theirresolutions.andM;According to the new conventions, all of those machines now have numbers inthe 5000 range, staying clear of the 4000 series that Varityper already uses.andO;(Varityper uses the 4200 and 4300 for its Ace-language models and 420OB-P and4300P for PostScript machines, which use Adobe Atlas RIPs.andP;  The 4200 and 4300models differ in speed, resolution, memory, etc., although they are based onthe same technology.)andM;The Varityper Series 5000 currently includes six items:andM;* The Series 5000 Image Controller, which formerly was called the Tegra ImageController.andM;* The 5080 (fomerly the XP-800, using a Canon LBP-SX engine), which prints on8 1/2 x 11&quot; plain paper at 800 x 400 dpi at eight pages per minute.andM;* The 5100 (formerly the XP-1000, using a Canon LBP-20), which prints on 11&quot;x17&quot; plain paper at 1,000 dpi at 20 pages per minute.andM;* The 5320 (formerly the XM-72, using an ECRM PelBox), which prints on72-pica photographic materials at 2,032 x 1,016 (or 2,032 x 2,032) dpi at aspeed of 5&quot; (or 2.5&quot;) per minute.andM;* The 5500 (fomerly the XM-108, using a PelBox), which prints on 108-picaphotographic materials at 2,016 dpi at a speed of 23.6&quot; per minute.andM;* The 5510 (a brand-new machine), which prints on plain paper 24&quot; wide by upto three feet long at 1,016 x 508 dpi at a speed of five 18&quot;x 24&quot; pages perminute or three 24&quot; x 36&quot; pages per minute.andM;The large-format 5510.andP;  The 5510 is based on die Canon LBP-DX, which in manyways appears to be a larger version of the LBP-20.andP;  It useselectrophotographic recording with a semiconductor laser to image on a drumin 'Vdte-blaw mode.andP;  (That is, it exposes the areas on the drum that me topick up toner.) It uses dry toner and a heat-and- pressure fusing system tofix the image.andP;  It prints on one side only.andM;The recording medium is plain paper either supplied in rolls or fed manuallyin sheets of varying sizes.andP;  (A paper senser automatically adjusts for thesize.) Varityper was demonstrating the machine using rolls 500 feet long.andO;Canon says die machine will accept rolls up to 548 feet for lighter weights.andO;The maximum roll width is 24 inches--easily sufficient for broadsheet news-paper pages, which tend to measure about 18 inches wide.andP;  A broadsheet pagecan be rotated 90 degrees to fit sideways.andM;As noted above, the speed is three or five pages per minute, depending onsize.andM;The output &quot;stacker&quot; is actually a vertical bin that allows the sheets todrop and, if they are longer than the height of die bin, flop face down overthe edge of the bin (see photo).andM;The claimed duty cycle is up to 5,000 prints per month.andM;The machine can be driven by the Varityper Series 5000 controller (formerlyTegra) in any of its emulation modes (Cora, PCL, Compugraphic 8600, CG 8400,CG SDLC and PostScript).andP;  At the show, it was outputting PostScript filesusing Varitypees new PostScript, interpreter.andP;  The resolution beingdemonstrated was 800 x 400 dpi, but the released version will support thefull 1,016 x 508.andM;Canon is offering the machine on an OEM basis for applications requiringprinting large pages: cAD/CAM plots, graphics, optical filing systems andartwork output required in the mi-crographics, engineering, plotter andpublishing industries.andP;  The machine in the Varityper booth was one of thefirst ones to be exhibited.andP;  The supply to OEM customers isn't expected tobegin until the fall, with end-user deliveries somewhat after that.andM;Varityper is quoting a price of $50,000 for the engine alone.andP;  The Series5000 controller costs $23,500.andP;  The PostScript interpreter adds $19,500, fora total of $93,000 for the machine demonstrated at ANPA.andM;PostScript output.andP;  Varityper has been testing and showing selectively itsPostScript interpreter, developed in conjunction with Custom Applications,Inc., for use with the former Tegra Image Controller.andP;  Now ready for regularcustomer shipments, it was demonstrated driving both plain-paper andphoto-materialrecorders.andM;Called the PostScript-Compatible Interpreter (PCI), it is an option supportedby an Image Controller, not a full-function, standalone RIP.andP;  It resides inthe Image Controller as an additional emulator that can be run in conjunctionwith other emulators.andP;  AH emulators access a common type library.andP;  Forcompatibility with Adobe PostScript, faces, Varityper takes Bitstream fontsand applies Adobe font metrics to match each character's width, x-height, capheight, lateral position, side bearings, stroke proportions, etc.andP;  Varitypersays the algorithm is more sophisticated than the ones used with its otheremulators.andM;In addition to the 35 standard LaserWriter fonts, Varityper will make theentire Tegra library available in the PCI environment and will provide morethan 300 fonts that emulate the Adobe library.andM;The PCI, which is retrofittable on Tegra Image Controllers in the field (byswapping three boards), includes a 20MHz 68020 processor, 16 MB of memory, aLocalTalk port, a software interpreter and 35 Adobe-compatible fonts.andM;Varityper says the PCI is 100% compatible with Adobe PostScript.andP;  It has runextensive tests designed by Bauer Enterprises and by General Technologies.andO;It also has performed applications testing using popular Macintosh and PCsoft-ware packages and involving mixed text and graphics from a variety ofprograms.andP;  Moreover, it solicited problem jobs from people in the field andran them as further tests.andP;  Vari-typer said it received &quot;thousands&quot; of thesetest jobs over the last nine or ten months 'The result, we were told, isassur-ance of full compatibility with standard PostScript.andM;Varityper doesn't have any means of mixing PostScript and non- PostScriptdata on die same page, although the operator can select any of the residentemulators for any particular job.andM;The PCI costs $19,500, on top of the $23,500 price of dic Image Controller,or a total of $43,000 for the Rip pro-tion of the output device.andP;  PelBoxescost $23,500 for the 72-pica version and $50,000 for the 108-pica one.andP;  Incon-trast, Varitypees other PostScript machines cost $54,995 for the 4300Pand $34,995 for the 420OB-P, complete.andP;  The 5000 Series machines have theadvantages of greater flexibility in choice of recorders and emulators, plusdie fact that they use the same fonts for aU emulations.andM;Fonts cost $175 each in smaU quantities, with discounts available for largerorders.andP;  Customers who already have Bitstream fonts can obtain the capabilityof using them to emulate Adobe faces for a one-time fee of $95.andM;Xerox 7650 for Mac; Locker dealingandM;Xerox demonstrated a Macintosh version of its 7650 scanner.andP;  Unlike the PCversion, which places the scanner card inside the PC, the Mac version putsthe board in the scanner.andP;  It then connects to the SCSI port on dieMacintosh.andP;  The scanner can still be used in a PC environment.andM;The functionality is the same as is available with the PC (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;16, p.andP;  28).andP;  The only difference is that on the Mac, the system can showanamorphic scaling, which can't be displayed on a PC.andM;The Mac version costs $9,995, including the scanner, SCSI interface andsoftware.andP;  An optional attachment for rotating the original mounted artworkin minute increments and rescanning die image in proper orientation costsanother $1,000.andM;Sales through Locker.andP;  Locker .Typesetting Equipment, which has beenprimarily a dealer of remanufactured Varityper imagesetters, showed notypesetters or composition packages at ANPA.andP;  Instead, it focused on theXerox 7650 scanner, for which it recently became a dealer.andM;Locker is selling the 7650 for Macs and PCs with interfaces Locker claims tohave developed in cooperation with Xerox.andP;  At the show the scanner was beingsold at $9,000 with a single interface; additional interfaces cost $1,500.andM;Locker seUs primarily through dealer referrals-dealers pass on to it leadsthat, if they turn into sales, generate commissions for the dealers.andP;  For the7650, actual dealers will be set up; they wiU provide support, and Xerox andLocker will be jointly responsible for supporting the dealer network.andM;As with Locker's deal with Varityper for the VT600, support arrangements willbe dividied: Xerox will be responsible for installation, warranty and servicefor the 7650, with Locker and the dealerships supporting other aspects of thesystem.andM;Xitron adds to XIPandM;Xitron, which is eyeing the replacement market for Compugraphic VideoSettersas a profitable addition to its oflier business, announced two more papersthat have gone that route: thc Times Argus of Barre, VT, and the Rutland (VT)Herald.andP;  Each customer ordered two XIP 400/CG units.andP;  Earlier, the Oakland(mi) Pros served as a beta site for the VideoSetter replacement.andP;  The XIP/400uses a Chelgraph Ace RIP and a 400-dpi, 11&quot; x 17&quot; Panasonic imaging engine.andM;Xitron also announced some new features for all models of the XIP, includingsupport for AppleTalk and for the logo scanner developed by Chelgraph (whichwas demonstrated at IPEX and at the Seybold Seminars last March).andP;  The XIPpreviously supported PostScript input through an RS-232 connector.andP;  TheAppleTalk capability is included in the $1,500 price of the PostScriptemulator Xitron sells.andM;The Xitron Logo Scanner (XLS) is based on a 300-dpi Canon flatbed scanner andon software developed by Chelgraph.andP;  It can be used to create fonts for anyof the XIP models.andP;  It sells for $5,000, including the scanner and softwarebut not the PC it runs  in.andM;Finally, Xitron reported an agreement in principle to establish a third-partyservice arrangement with Dow Jones Service, of Princeton, NJ, which willenable the XIP to be handled by the 77 Dow Jones service centers in the U.S.andO;and Canada, staffed by 400 people.andP;  Annual maintenance contracts wiU beoffered at prices based on distance from the local center and type of servicedesired.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
