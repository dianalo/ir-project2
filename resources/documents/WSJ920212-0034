Despite the overall conclusion, the GATT report is sure toincrease environmental groups' opposition to sweeping changesproposed for the world trading system. Under the GATTinterpretation, U.S. laws that bar the imports of foods andother products, unless they are produced in a way deemed bythe U.S. to be environmentally sound, would be consideredimproper restraints of trade.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;To allow each (GATT) party unilaterally to impose specialduties against whatever it objects to among the domesticpolicies of other parties would risk an eventual descent intochaotic trade conditions similar to those that plagued the1930s,&quot; the GATT environmental report said.   Lori Wallach, a staff attorney for Public Citizen, a RalphNader-affiliated consumer group that is organizing oppositionto the GATT, said the report shows &quot;the GATT perspective onenvironmental issues -- that they're an impediment to trade.&quot;She said that &quot;mind-set&quot; has prompted consumer andenvironmental groups to target GATT, which for years has hadlittle visibility and evoked little passion in the U.S.   The GATT, based in Geneva, is currently negotiating abroad liberalization in international trade rules. The talks,which involve 108 nations, are stalled primarily by disputesbetween the U.S. and European Community over agriculturalsubsidies. But if negotiators can reach a compromise, theGATT's powers to settle trade disputes involvingenvironmental issues would be greatly strengthened. Any GATTagreement would have to be approved by Congress, which islikely to pay close attention to environmental concerns.   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute forInternational Economics in Washington, said that GATT needsto develop an environmental code, in which a country couldtry to impose its environmental standards on others. But thecountry would also have to notify the GATT of its rules andtry to resolve controversies among trading countries. &quot;Thatwould provide a channel for national actions intended tofoster advances in environmental norms,&quot; he said.   The GATT report said that liberalized trade would aid theenvironment largely because it would lessen subsidies andshift agricultural production to countries such as Argentina,Australia and Thailand. Those countries use less thanone-tenth the amount of chemical fertilizer per acre thancountries in Europe. The EC has become one of the world'sbiggest agricultural exporters largely because of a hugesystem of export subsidies.   &quot;In all likelihood, there would be a substantial increasein global environmental quality,&quot; the report said.   Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist whoadvises the GATT and oversaw the drafting of theenvironmental report, said GATT rules don't apply toenvironmental policies that are strictly domestic. Forinstance, the GATT would have nothing to say about U.S.requirements that cars driven in the U.S. must be equippedwith tailpipe devices to reduce pollution.   But he said GATT rules don't permit one nation to imposeits environmental standards on another through the use oftrade restrictions. &quot;If you start objecting to the way otherpeople do things, then they can object to what we do,&quot; Prof.Bhagwati said. &quot;Then it becomes almost open-ended.&quot;   U.S. environmentalists have been incensed over a GATTruling that disallowed a U.S. law barring imports of tunathat are caught in nets that can trap dolphins as well. Underthe law, the U.S. has prohibited imports of tuna from Mexico,Venezuela and Vanuatu. Last year, Mexico objected to theGATT; a GATT dispute-settlement panel found in Mexico'sfavor, saying that the U.S. couldn't embargo a product simplybecause Mexico's regulations didn't satisfy the U.S. Mexicoand the U.S. are now trying to resolve the dispute.   The GATT environmental report backed the reasoning in thetuna case. &quot;In principle, it is not possible under GATT'srules to make access to one's own market dependent on thedomestic environmental policies of the exporting country,&quot;the report said.   Prof. Bhagwati said that environmentalists -- if notgovernments -- would still be free to organize boycottsagainst an offending country. And nations could negotiate amultilateral treaty on environmental standards, such as theone phasing out chemicals suspected to be thinning theEarth's protective ozone layer, he said. If those treatiescontain trade sanctions against non-complying countries, theagreements could be treated as waivers of general GATT rules,which usually require two-thirds of GATT's membership toagree.   GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel said the organization&quot;must protect against the risk of the environment beingkidnapped by trade protectionist interests.&quot; But Ms. Wallach,the consumer activist, said the greater problem is the&quot;environmental crisis,&quot; which requires individual countriesto insist on tougher standards. &quot;There's no time to wait forglobal consensus,&quot; she said.</TEXT></DOC>
