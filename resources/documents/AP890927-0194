Araki, 99, was appointed paramount religious leader, or marja'taqlid, by the country's top theologians after the June 3 death ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Khomeini, who died of a heart attack at age 86, was Iran'shighest religious and political authority. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,voted to succed him in the political role, is a middle-rankingcleric and lacks the authority needed to rule on religious matters.   The 16 Shiites were beheaded after they were convicted by Saudiauthorities of planting bombs in Mecca that killed a Pakistani manand wounded 16 other pilgrims July 10.   After the death sentences were carried out, Saudi televisionscreened taped interviews of the condemned men in which theyconfessed to setting the bombs and said two Iranians at the IranianEmbassy in Kuwait supplied them with explosives and training. Irandenied it.   Araki said it was up to the Moslem clerics ``not to remainsilent,'' adding:   ``It is up to them to raise their cry to inform the public, tosupport Islam and the religion of God and to salvage the two holyplaces from the claws of oppression and the government of theblasphemers.''   Iranian leaders have long demanded that Mecca and Medina,Islam's holiest cities, be wrested from the control of the Saudiroyal family and put in charge of an international commission.   Following the executions, Iranian leaders repeatedly have calledfor revenge against Saudi Arabia.   On Wednesday, four masked men who said they representedHezbollah, or Party of God, in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia held a newsconference in Beirut and threatened to punish Saudi Arabia.   The executions brought to an end recent efforts to improverelations between Shiite Moslem Iran and Saudi Arabia, whichfollows the Sunni Moslem sect. The two sects have been antagonisticsince a split in Islam in the 7th century.   Relations between Tehran and Riyadh previously reached theirnadir in 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranian,were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca.</TEXT></DOC>
