Trueleaders can only be followed if their ideals and convictions are truly worthfollowing.;    -- Mary Lou Sontra; San Jose; SOCIETY CAN DEMAND A LIMIT TOCHILDREN; In his column of Dec. 30, Cal Thomas speaks out strongly against theidea of fighting poverty by paying welfare recipients to use a contraceptivedevice. He defends rights of the people to reproduce.;    The citizens of ademocratic society enjoy many rights. In order for that society to succeed,those citizens must also assume certain responsibilities; among them theresponsibility for the consequences of their own actions.;    In the case ofprocreation, it is fair and reasonable for society to require that a citizenwho exercises his right to reproduce should also exercise his responsibilityto support his offspring.;    Thomas defends the demand that society assumethe responsibility for the support of the children who have come into beingbecause people have exercised their right to reproduce.;    The knife shouldcut both ways. If society is going to assume the responsibility for thesupport of these children, society should have the right to insist that theirnumbers be controlled.;    Any argument to the contrary, particularly withregard to the city of Philadelphia, which is on the brink of bankruptcy,ignores the burden of personal responsibility which must be assumed by thecitizenry if a society is to survive.;    -- Dudley McFadden; Sunnyvale;FAILURE TO PERFORM DESERVES NO REWARD; We were very concerned when we read(Mercury News, Dec. 30) that Governor Deukmejian considered Roxani Gillespiefor a Superior Court judge appointment.;    Gillespie is a woman who would notperform the duties of her last position as state insurance commissioner; shefailed to enforce the will of the people with her refusal to implementProposition 103.;    We feel she should not be rewarded for her poorperformance as insurance commissioner with a Superior Court seat.;    --Dennis and Debra Roe; San Jose; ARTICLE WAS UNFAIR TO HIMMELSBACH; A freepress is essential to keep us aware, to keep those in power honest, and toexpose those who aren't. But the press should strive to be fair.;    Yourtreatment of Leo Himmelsbach has not been fair. During a distinguished 30-yearcareer with the district attorney's office, Himmelsbach worked hard, washonest and successful, and deserved more than a boring rehash of degradingcommentary by unnamed critics, along with old criticism of political judgmentcalls. Leo was not a politician, but he was a good district attorney.;    Ifwe had more people in positions of power and influence with Leo Himmelsbach'scommitment to honesty, decency, fairness and responsibility, we would allbenefit.;    -- Robert L. Morrison; Chief of Investigations; DistrictAttorney's Office,; Santa Clara County; SELLER, NOT REALTOR SETS PRICE OFHOME; The dormant real estate market in the Bay Area is a source ofconsiderable hardship to anxious home sellers and Realtors alike.;    Arelatively simple way to stimulate the market would be for sellers to takemore responsibility for lowering home prices. For example, they shoulddetermine the last comparable sale price in their neighborhood and ask thesame price.;    The seller also controls the Realtor's commission. There aremore than 5,000 Realtors in the Bay Area, and their commissions are negotiatedjust as home prices are negotiated. Many Realtors offer good incentives tosellers.;    Please inform your readers that it is willing buyers and sellersthat determine actual sale prices. It is sellers that determine asking prices.The Realtor is a facilitator in the transaction and does not establishpricing.;    -- Jack Taylor; Morgan Hill  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  712  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009181,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
