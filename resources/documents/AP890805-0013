In the rush to complete its work before a monthlong recess, theSenate passed the compromise $159 billion savings and loan bailoutplan and sent it to the House. The Sandamp;L vote in the Senate onPresident Bush's first and biggest legislative initiative wasanti-climactic, without even a roll call. A sharply divided Housepassed the bill 201-175 just moments after midnight.   At the outset of its more than 15-hour lawmaking marathon, theHouse voted 312-105 to adopt military appropriations legislation.The measure would cut $1.8 billion from Star Wars, strictly curtailproduction of the B-2 bomber and eliminate all funds for theMidgetman nuclear missile, the advanced tactical fighter and cruisemissile. President Bush has threatened to veto the bill.   The Senate also passed legislation on financial liability foroil spills, aid to farmers hit by the drought and a temporary $70billion extension to the $2.8 trillion federal debt limit, whichthe House had approved earlier.   While Congress pushed for speedy action on a series of bills,Bush complained to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,about Senate delays on 120 of his appointments.   ``The president wanted to register his deep concern that thesewere being held up for artificial reasons not related to thecandidates themselves,'' presidential press secretary MarlinFitzwater told reporters at the White House.   The ``artificial reasons,'' according to administrationofficials and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., are partypolitics.   Among the nominations the Senate has not yet acted on are Bush'sselection of Donald Gregg, who has been linked to the Iran-Contraaffair, as ambassador to South Korea and several nominees to thescandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban Development.   Away from the legislative action and White House complaints, theHouse ethics committee said it had decided to investigate threelawmakers accused of sexual improprieties.   The committee voted in secret session Thursday to conductpreliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill.;Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif.   Lukens was convicted in Ohio on a misdemeanor charge ofcontributing to the unruliness of a child. He was sentenced June 30to 180 days in jail and fined $1,000 for having sex with a teen-agegirl.   Two former aides to Bates have filed a complaint alleging hesexually harassed female members of his staff. Three Democratsfiled a complaint against Savage after news reports said a PeaceCorps volunteer complained the congressman fondled her while he wastraveling in Zaire.   Sen. David Durenberger, D-Minn., disclosed that the Senateethics committee has completed a preliminary inquiry of hispreviously disclosed book contract that an opponent claimed was adevice to circumvent limits on fee income. The senator said thecommittee had decided to proceed with its investigation.   The last major legislative battle before the recess concernedthe thrift bailout.   A tenuous compromise with the Bush administration, agreed tolate Thursday night, was threatened as key House Democratsannounced opposition. In particular, they objected to financingprovisions that would keep much of the cost of the bailout outs theysaid, addsubstantially to the overall expense to be borne by taxpayers.   With savings and loan losses mounting at a rate of $20 millionor more a day, Bush wrote to the lawmakers, ``Final passage remainscritical to the stability and solvency of the financial system.''   The landmark bill would close or merge hundreds of insolventsavings institutions.   Setting the stage for the difficult task of deciding the Sandamp;Lbailout, the House moved quickly on the defense appropriations billthat largely conformed to the military authorization plan passed bythe chamber last week.   Despite word from the White House budget office that thepresident's senior advisers would recommend a veto, and a similarassessment from the ranking Republican on the House Armed ServicesCommittee, the chamber gave overwhelming approval to the plan.   In fact, the vote for the appropriations plan _ 312-105 _amounted to a stronger statement than the 261-162 approval of theauthorization bill.   ``They have conformed,'' Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama,ranking GOP member on Armed Services, said of the two pieces oflegislation. ``But that still makes it veto-bait in my opinion.''   Dickinson said he hoped that when members of the Senate andHouse meet early in September to craft a final version of the bill,the ``most egregious add-ons and deletions can be modified andlimited to make it acceptable to the administration.''   Among the other final-day action taken by Congress:   _The Senate voted 99-0 to increase industry's financialliability for oil spills, create a nationwide system to clean upsuch accidents and establish a $1 billion trust fund to helpcompensate for damages. The vote came less than five months afterthe tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska's Prince WilliamSound, spilling 11 million gallons of oil.   _The House and Senate approved a compromise plan providing $895million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the droughtand other weather-related problems. Bush administration officialshave indicated that the president will sign the legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
