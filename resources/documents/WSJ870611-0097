Currently, the insurer's loss reserves total $86.9 million. The company also agreed that it wouldn't resume paying dividends without the agency's approval.    The Ohio agency had disagreed with the company and its consulting actuaries, Coopers andamp; Lybrand, about the adequacy of medical malpractice loss reserves. The company contended that assigning reserves for such liability claims on a long-term basis is difficult and complex because of economic and regulatory uncertainties.    The agreement calls for Physicians Insurance to immediately increase its reserves by adjusting contracts covering certain executive compensation and reinsurance. The company said it also will impose a surcharge on premiums during the next three years.    The company's latest dividend was 6.5 cents a share, paid in March 1985. Last August, it declared a 6-for-5 stock split. </TEXT></DOC>
