Instead, forwardmaritime options are in his judgment best designed to contribute to successfulNATO coalition warfare and war termination. War termination rather thanvictory is the proper objective to which maritime forces can contribute,since the alternative is mutual nuclear devastation. Yet Americans haveinherited a tradition of total victory in conflicts defined as strugglesbetween good and evil. Navies can serve the objectives of war terminationin several ways. The case of the Central Front in Europe is illustrative.NATO must avoid losing the &quot;short war&quot; while preparing for protractedconflict. During the short war, maritime forces can help to prevent politicalcollapse of the alliance. In the extended phase, naval forces can helpto prevent military defeat by maintaining sea lanes of communication.But preventing defeat is insufficient; NATO needs a strategy for prevailingin an extended war. The added ingredients which would allow the Westto prevail have been suggested to be: nuclear weapons; Western industrialsuperiority in protracted war; a NATO conventional retaliatory offensive;high technology conventional weapons; and/or playing &quot;China card.&quot; Theauthor finds these alternatives deficient, compared to the proper exploitationof U.S. maritime superiority. Forward maritime operations hould be taskedto destroy the Soviet general purpose fleet and to place at risk thestrategic nuclear correlation of forces by threatening Soviet strategicballistic missile submarines. Combined with stalemate on the CentralFront, U.S. maritime pressure on the Soviet homeland will create highincentives for them to seek war termination.</TEXT></DOC>
