Grisdela and Lee BertonStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission censured KMG Main Hurdman, a New York-based accounting firm, for &quot;improper professional conduct&quot; in connection with its audits of First National Bank of Midland, Midland, Texas, and of Time Energy Inc.    The SEC also imposed sanctions on the accounting firm requiring it to tighten its internal control procedures, among other things.    Main Hurdman settled the agency's charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, the accounting firm agreed to the censure and said it would take steps to put in place and maintain adequate internal controls.    Main Hurdman has an agreement to merge with Peat Marwick Mitchell andamp; Co. next Wednesday, and the SEC order addresses that. It specifies that if Main Hurdman merges with a larger accounting firm this year, the combined firm must have internal controls that comply with the procedures the agency is requiring Main Hurdman to adopt, as well as adequate quality control reviews and training programs.    In its administrative proceedings, the SEC alleged that Main Hurdman's audits of First National Bank of Midland in 1982 and its audits and reviews of the financial statements of Time Energy from 1983 through the second quarter of 1985 &quot;were not conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.&quot;    Some critics of faulty auditing say such SEC administrative actions are &quot;mere wrist slaps&quot; and they call for harsher discipline against major firms.    But SEC officials say that the purpose of these censures is &quot;remedial rather than punitive.&quot; Also, the SEC notes that it has initiated more censures of major accounting firms in recent years. In the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, the SEC censured 14 major accounting firms for faulty audits and other alleged misconduct. In some SEC actions over the past few years, accounting firms have been suspended from practicing before the SEC until remedial actions, such as peer review or education for professionals, have been completed.    The SEC also charged that Main Hurdman failed to exercise &quot;due care&quot; and &quot;adequate professional skepticism&quot; in its audits of the two companies, both of which were experiencing financial difficulties.    In New York, John Thompson, chairman of KMG Main Hurdman, said the firm has reviewed the work performed in the audits of the bank and Time Energy and &quot;stands behind it.&quot;    &quot;We felt that it was desirable to settle these disputes and put them behind us&quot; with the merger with Peat Marwick pending, he said. &quot;Under any other circumstances, we would have contested vigorously.&quot;    First National Bank of Midland, which had a large portfolio of loans to the oil and gas industry, was declared insolvent on Oct. 15, 1983, and placed under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the SEC said.    Houston-based Time Energy, an energy management company, last year agreed to restate its earnings from 1983 through 1985 to settle SEC charges that it issued &quot;materially false and misleading&quot; financial statements during that period.    Officials at Time Energy couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Although the audits were performed by Main Hurdman's field offices in Midland and in Houston, the SEC also faulted the firm's New York office. The New York office, it said, failed to require a more critical analysis of the circumstances in both cases and failed to adequately document the consulting process between the offices. </TEXT></DOC>
