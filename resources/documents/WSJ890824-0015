For Mr. Jensen, who sometimes posed as a neurologist to impress acquaintances, no run-of-the-mill Beechcraft or Lear would do. His private plane was a Boeing 727, paid for with funds that federal prosecutors contend were bilked from two Texas savings and loans.    Now Mr. Jensen is hoping his less flamboyant side has impressed a federal court jury. The jury began deliberations yesterday on 88 charges against him and six co-defendants accused of pocketing more than $166 million through a condominium-financing scheme that stripped $327 million from five savings and loans.    In closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger McRoberts said his &quot;particular favorite&quot; among the charges is the one accusing Mr. Jensen of illegally transporting $2 million for the Boeing 727 purchase. &quot;Maybe instead of passing himself off as a neurologist he wanted to pretend he was president of American Airlines,&quot; Mr. McRoberts suggested.    For the jury, the tales of private jets, $4 million mansions and gold Rolex watches handed out like party favors were the juicy sidelights in a six-month lesson in how the thrift industry got where it is today.    The extravagances of the defendants would put the ignominious stars of the TV show &quot;Dallas&quot; to shame. But the excesses were made possible by a more mundane and systematic problem than Hollywood would use: Savings and loans were flush with funds from brokered deposits -- certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more placed in specific institutions to draw favorable interest rates -- that made them ripe for fraud.    Mr. McRoberts told the jury that Mr. Jensen lured more than $60 million in brokered deposits into Lancaster First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association in the first three months that he controlled the thrift. Prior to Mr. Jensen's acquisition in late 1982, the Lancaster thrift, located in a Dallas suburb, had no brokered funds.    Empire Savings andamp; Loan Association of Mesquite, which lost the most money through the defendants' alleged scheme, saw its brokered deposits swell from $35 million in June 1982 to more than $240 million in December 1983. In March 1984, Empire became the first Texas thrift ever closed by federal regulators.    &quot;Without the money, there would have been no scheme to defraud,&quot; said Mr. McRoberts, one of five federal prosecutors assigned to the case, which was moved to Lubbock from Dallas on a change of venue requested by the defendants.    The prosecutors allege that Mr. Jensen and Empire's chairman, Spencer H. Blain Jr., received millions of dollars in kickbacks in exchange for providing loans for land acquisition and condominium construction concentrated along Interstate 30, east of Dallas. The loans were based on fraudulently inflated appraisals, prosecutors said, and went to borrowers whose financial statements had been falsified to make the institutions appear creditworthy.    Lawyers for the seven defendants, including two real-estate appraisers, argued to the jury that the loans were a legitimate response to the real-estate boom sweeping Texas in the early 1980s. The defense lawyers also argued that federal regulators encouraged thrifts to engage in risky lending to stay profitable. Regulators then caused the bust, the defense lawyers contended, by hastily shutting Empire and the other thrifts.    &quot;The government brought this case against these defendants to cover up their own colossal mistake,&quot; said Deborah Goodall, one of the attorneys for Mr. Blain.    Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart took issue with Ms. Goodall's comment in his statements to the jury: &quot;Is she arguing that Congress intended for Spencer Blain to get a $16 million kickback?&quot; he asked.    Mr. Hart went on to remind the jurors that 100 other people, most of them borrowers, have been convicted and sentenced for crimes related to the condominium-financing scheme.    &quot;This is the final step in the ladder, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Mr. Hart said. &quot;What would truly be an injustice would be for those people to serve their time and for the people who made the most money to go free.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
