In the confusion of the post-Gulf War era I only hope theleaders of the victorious forces will not make the samemistakes as Levi Eshkol in 1967, Golda Meir in 1973 andMenachem Begin in 1982. In defeat, people feel they havenothing to lose; humiliation breeds belligerence rather thanhumility.</LP><TEXT>   For those of us who are sick to death of the relentlessnegative philosophies of the Palestinians, let us try againto counter their emotional behavior with clear thought and akind heart. After all, their diaspora is probably not unlikeours, and we know how much it hurts.   F. Michael Perkins   New York   ---   The headline asks &quot;The Lost People: In Humiliating Defeat,Can the Palestinians Finally Find Peace?&quot; Thus you base yourstory on two fallacies.   On the thousands of minority and ethnic groups who havesuffered through this century, the Palestinians are the leastlost. The constant focus of world attention and &quot;peacemaking&quot;efforts, the largest recipients of international aid and thebeneficiaries of diverse and powerful political lobbies, thePalestinians have had more opportunities than any othersmall, powerless group to achieve peace and prosperity.Greater than all these advantages, the Palestinians have hadthe good fortune of possessing an &quot;enemy&quot; like Israel. Whatmost oppressed groups would give for such an &quot;enemy&quot;]   The Palestinians have not &quot;found peace&quot; because all theirleaders have ever pursued or espoused are violence andhatred. What country would be insane enough to lie downwillingly next to a people who will sacrifice all for aleader like Saddam Hussein?   Timna Katz   Los Angeles</TEXT></DOC>
