In compliance with the filing requirements of 19 CFR 353.12,petitioner alleges that imports of gray portland cement and clinker fromMexico are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at lessthan fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports materially injure, orthreaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Petitioner has alleged it has standing to file the petition. Specifically,petitioner has alleged that it is an interested party as defined undersection 771(9)(F) of the Act and that it has filed the petition on behalfof a regional U.S. industry producing the product that is subject to thisinvestigation. Any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C),(D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, that wishes to registersupport for, or opposition to, this petition, must file written notificationwith the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price and Foreign Market Value </ITAG>Petitioner's estimate of United States Price is based on the ex-factoryprice charged by a Mexican producer/exporter for the sale of a large shipmentof gray portland cement to a U.S. customer in May 1989. Petitioner alsobases its estimate of United States Price on unit Customs value of importsfrom Mexico for May 1989. Petitioner's estimate of foreign market value (FMV) is based on the priceat which such or similar merchandise is sold or offered for sale in theprincipal markets of Mexico. Based on a comparison of United States Price and FMV as estimated by thePetitioner, the alleged dumping margins range from 96 to 111 percent. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation </ITAG>Under section 732(c) of the Act, we must determine, within 20 days aftera petition is filed, whether it sets forth the allegations necessary forthe initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether it containsinformation reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations.We examined the petition on gray portland cement and clinker from Mexicoand found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act.Therefore, in accordance with section 732 of the Act, we are initiatingan antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of grayportland cement and clinker from Mexico are being, or are likely to be,sold in the United States at less than fair value. If our investigationproceeds normally, we will make a preliminary determination by March 5,1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). The products covered by this investigation include gray portland cementand clinker. Gray portland cement is a hydraulic cement and the primarycomponent of concrete. Clinker, an intermediate material produced whenmanufacturing cement, has no other use than for being ground into finishedcement. Gray portland cement is currently classifiable under HTS item number2523.29, and cement clinker is currently classifiable under number 2523.10.Gray portland cement has also been entered under number 2523.90 as ``otherhydraulic cements.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Exclusion </ITAG>Any producer or reseller that desires exclusion from an antidumping dutyorder must submit to the Assistant Secretary of Import Administration,not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice, anirrevocable written request for exclusion in accordance with 19 CFR 353.14.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notification of ITC </ITAG>Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this actionand to provide it with the information we used to arrive at this determination.We will notify the ITC and make available to it all nonprivileged and nonproprietaryinformation.
