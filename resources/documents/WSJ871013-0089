The central bank ordered a bank holiday for today and tomorrow to clear the way for the new measures, which President Raul Alfonsin is expected to announce by tomorrow night. Banks were closed yesterday for the Columbus Day holiday.    Financial sources said the plan includes a wage and price freeze; a tax increase; establishment of a two-tier exchange-rate system, one tier aimed at importers and exporters and the other at financial institutions; and a new devaluation of the austral, Argentina's currency, that is expected to be much smaller than last Friday's devaluation of 12.96%.    Argentina, whose foreign debt totals $54 billion, is tentatively due to receive loan disbursements both from foreign commercial banks and from the International Monetary Fund by early November, but to receive the funds it needs a waiver from the IMF to exempt the country from fiscal and monetary targets that couldn't be met this year.    Meanwhile, banking sources said they considered the two-tier exchange-rate system as a prelude to the eventual establishment of a modified free-exchange market. Argentina currently has a single official exchange rate for the austral, but there also is a black market. A two-tier system would give greater official scope to the market value of the currency, as opposed to the fixed rate desired for foreign trade. </TEXT></DOC>
