Oil ministers from five of the 13 members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries meet tonight with representatives ofMexico, China, Egypt and five other non-OPEC oil producers todiscuss possible production cuts.   The meeting will mark the widest participation of non-cartel oilexporters in direct talks with OPEC in history. But many industryanalysts say they see little chance of a firm accord this week onjoint output cuts.   The OPEC ministers gathered at the cartel's headquarters incentral Vienna at midday today to lay the groundwork for the jointmeeting set for tonight.   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister and president of OPEC,offered no details of the meeting's agenda as he entered thebuilding.   ``We hope to have a good meeting, a useful meeting,'' he toldreporters. Other officials declined to comment.   World oil prices have been falling as supplies exceed demand.   Although the U.S. government was not represented, Kent Hance, amember of the Texas Railroad Commission, was in Vienna to talk withOPEC officials. The commission regulates that state's 2 millionbarrels a day of oil production.   Hance said in an interview today he had met with Fadhil Chalabi,the OPEC deputy secretary general, and other members of the OPECstaff on Monday.   ``The main thing is to establish a dialogue'' with the OPECmembers, he said. ``The main message we'd like to get across isstability'' for oil prices.   The Texas economy has been severely hurt by the sharp decline inoil prices over the past two years.   Hance declined to be specific when asked whether he wouldsuggest to OPEC the possibility of Texas imposing restraints on oilproduction in the state.   But Platt's Oilgram News, a New York-based industry newsletter,quoted him Tuesday as saying he ``couldn't make a deal onproduction even if (he) wanted to,'' and that, in such a case, theother two railroad commissioners and the Texas governor would haveto be consulted.   ``The Saudis seem to be very much against any oil productioncuts,'' Graham Andrews, an analyst in the London office of theinvestment firm Wood, Mackenzie and Co, said on Monday.   He said in a telephone interview that one reason for the Saudireluctance may be to avoid allowing Iran to use increased revenuesfrom higher oil prices to strengthen its stand in the war againstIraq. The Saudis indirectly support Irag in the war that began inSeptember 1980. On Sunday, Iranian naval gunboats attacked aSaudi-owned tanker in the Persian Gulf.   OPEC decided earlier this month to invite eight non-cartel oilexporters to Vienna, saying a broader base of nations must bear theburden of production restraint if prices are to return to OPEC'sdeclared target of $18 a barrel. Most OPEC oil is selling for atleast $2 a barrel less than the target price.   The non-OPEC countries participating in the Vienna meeting areMexico, China, Egypt, Oman, Angola, Malaysia, Colombia and Brunei.Their production totals about 8 million barrels a day, althoughtheir combined exports are believed to be less than half that.   In 1984 OPEC began inviting representatives of Mexico, Egypt andother smaller producers to observe OPEC meetings. In March 1986 itheld direct negotiations with Mexico and four other independentproducers but no agreement was reached on production cuts.</TEXT></DOC>
