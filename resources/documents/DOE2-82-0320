The charateristic size of impurity densitydecrease, depending on plasma parameters, the type and charge state ofimpurities, was determined for the turbulent and convectional mechanismsof plasma transport. It is shown that radial distribution of impuritiesis sufficiently more flattened than it can be expected on the basis ofclassical concepts. The reason lies in existence of effective mechanismsof impurity removal to chamber walls, such as turbulent transport andconvection of plasma.</TEXT></DOC>
