The frequently discussed idea is reviewed that substantialoverpressures arising in the warm, medium and/or highly supersonic compressionsof H I clouds can push sub-Jeans mass clumps to densities where gravitycan take over and complete the star formation process. A nonequilibriummodel is used to analyze the impact of external disturbances on gas clouds,and estimates of the required disturbance amplitudes are substantiallyreduced from previous estimates based on equilibrium arguments. The resultsreveal that a cloud which cools under compression is particularly sensitiveto mild disturbances from its environment. Furthermore, the specificenergy required to trigger effective compressions in a cooling mediumis nearly independent of the cloud's mass. It is proposed that mildlynonlinear disturbances play a primary role in the formation of molecularcloud and stars. 26 references.</TEXT></DOC>
