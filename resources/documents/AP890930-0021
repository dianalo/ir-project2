(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Boots, wallets and belts, theconventional results of Florida's annual alligator hunt, have maderoom for a more imaginative batch of byproducts ranging fromfreeze-dried gator heads to gator spread.   With the end of the second state-sanctioned alligator hunttonight, taxidermists, hunting stores and souvenir shops are tryingto outdo each other in providing an ever-widening array of gatorknickknacks.   ``You would be amazed,'' said Ernie Santo of an Orlando shopcalled Gatorland. ``Alligator products are becoming more and moreexclusive, and more and more popular.   ``That's mainly because Florida and Louisiana are the onlyplaces to get gators,'' Santo said. ``People love this stuff.''   A popular item carried by Gatorland is the freeze-dried gatorhead, which sells for $79.95.   Just what anybody might want to do with such an off-beat item isleft up to customers' imagination.   In Clewiston, the heart of the month-long hunt on the shores ofLake Okeechobee, the Field and Stream shop has a gator-foot backscratcher for $24.95, and the Skip Shop in Waldo offers key chainsmade from gator toes for $9.95 apiece.   State-licensed gator trapper Mike Rafferty says he couldn't keepup with demand for gator bric-a-brac after last year's hunt.   This year, he has expanded his product range.   ``I've come out with a gourmet food line,'' he said. ``I've gotalligator spread, smoked alligator and alligator fritters.''   Alligator meat, he explained, is low in fat and high in protein.   ``They're good for you,'' Rafferty concluded.   The booming business in alligator byproducts represents aradical change for the reptile which only a few years ago wasconsidered a prime candidate for Florida's state animal.   But in 1982, the Florida alligator lost out in that contest tothe endangered Florida panther. And while it remains against thelaw to kill a panther, gators have become fair game for selectedhunters across the state every September.   The principle reason for that turnaround is that the gators haveflourished under their protected status in recent years.   ``They're a renewable resource,'' according to Lindsey Hord ofthe Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission in Okeechobee.``And as long as they are, there's absolutely no sense in thepeople of Florida not taking advantage of it.''   ``It's my belief that's why (gators) were put here,'' Hord said,``for us to use _ and people sure are using them.''</TEXT></DOC>
