(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women who trade sex for a brief high on crackare being blamed for a 69.7 percent increase in syphilis in ruralGeorgia.   ``The geographics of this increase are very significant,'' saidJane Carr, director of the state Office of Infectious Disease.``We're seeing syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseaseswhere we've never seen them before.   ``They used to be reported only in the larger metro areas. Nowit's the rural areas that are reporting the majority of theincrease.''   Georgia reported 2,614 cases of syphilis in 1986, 2,656 in 1987and 4,436 last year. The increase has been 125 percent for blackwomen and 53 percent for black men, compared with a 37 percentincrease for white women and a 7 percent decline among white men.Officials attribute the decrease to AIDS education.   In the Albany health district, syphilis cases have more thandoubled, from 232 in 1987, when crack cocaine arrived, to almost 500this year.   Ray Shierling, one of six state epidemiologists who interviewsyphilis victims in 14 southwestern counties, said there are``little girls out on the street every night having sex numeroustimes just for cocaine.''   ``A lot of times girls don't have money, so they use the nextbest thing. They trade their bodies for drugs,'' said Lt. BenMorris, head of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Drug Squad.   Shierling, who interviews infected people and tries to contacttheir sex partners, said that where three to four contacts in sixmonths once was normal, investigators now are lucky to get two namesbecause clients have had too many to remember or are reluctant todiscuss matters that involve illegal drugs.   ``We have very little success in interviewing the street girls,''he said.   Women, ranging from their teens to their 30s, may have sex withfive or six men to buy one $20 ``rock'' of crack, said anAlbany-Dougherty County Drug Unit investigator who spoke oncondition of anonymity. ``It's one of the highest highs that most ofthese junkies have ever had. But it's over very quickly. Then theyimmediately need more, so it's a vicious cycle.''   Ted Holloway, health director for the Waycross district, said his16 counties had 50 to 60 cases of syphilis a year through 1984. Butin 1987, 201 cases were reported and last year there were 255.   Officials agree that increased use of cocaine seems to be a majorfactor, and the Department of Human Resources' Division of PublicHealth has begun a three-month study in the Waycross, Valdosta,Brunswick and Atlanta areas to substantiate the link betweensyphilis and drugs.   People who test positive for syphilis also will be testedanonymously for the AIDS virus and for drug use. Blood samples willbe sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's crime lab fortesting.   ``There's a definite system to it,'' Holloway said. ``Whether inWaycross or Atlanta, drug dealers settle in low-income housingprojects where they get young females hooked on crack or coke.   ``To support their habits, these women may sell or trade sex withas many as 20 partners a day, without ever knowing who they are.When they can't remember the names of these sexual contacts,epidemiologists can't find the contacts so they go untreated and,more likely than not, infect someone else.''   Untreated sexually transmitted diseases increase the risk ofinfection with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, whichcan enter the body through breaks in the skin, such as the chancresthat can form on the penis, vagina, tongue and lips of thoseinfected with syphilis.   ``The current emphasis on AIDS testing and education has createda drain on staff and funds,'' Ms. Carr said. ``Yet it is extremelyimportant that we do so because syphilis is known to increase therisk of contracting the AIDS virus threefold.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 24</NOTE></DOC>
