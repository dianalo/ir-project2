But our results for the ratio of the doubleto single ionisation were uniformly too low by about 35%. We report herefirst Born calculations in which single-electron d orbitals have beenadded to our earlier basis of s and p functions. The single to doubleionisation cross section ratio we obtain is now in excellent quantitativeagreement with the common high-energy limit of that ratio measured forprotons, antiprotons, electrons and {alpha} particles.</TEXT></DOC>
