The action is designed to clear the way for the Senate to take up the tax bill as early as next week. The tax increases are also contained in the bill passed last month by the House, making it more likely that Congress will send a tax boost to the president this fall.    The tax increases would come from an acceleration in corporate estimated tax payments, a restriction on the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations and curbs on life insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters. The revenue-raising provisions are acceptable to the Reagan administration, especially because they would pay for some sought-after extensions of tax breaks and technical corrections to the 1986 tax-overhaul law.    The Finance Committee package would significantly enlarge the tax bill the committee approved this summer, which contained little more than technical corrections and a diesel-fuel provision demanded by farmers. The package, prepared yesterday by the panel's staff after informal approval by senators, will be presented as a committee-sponsored amendment when the Senate takes up the tax bill.    Committee members could make changes in the package at their meeting today, and it will be subject to amendments on the Senate floor.    The new package would temporarily extend some popular tax breaks that have expired or are about to expire, including the research-and-development tax credit and tax incentives for savings institutions that take over sick thrifts. The extensions, however, would be for one year or less, limiting the amount of tax increases the lawmakers have to come up with.    &quot;I don't want a lot of new taxes,&quot; Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said in an interview yesterday &quot;Obviously, I want to keep it as clean as possible.&quot;    But Sen. Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has turned over primary management of the tax bill to Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), so that he can campaign today and into next week. Permitting Sen. Baucus, the chairman of the tax subcommittee, to manage the bill for the Democrats lets Sen. Bentsen sidestep controversy over possible tax increases as he runs for vice president.    The new Finance Committee package would raise about $2 billion in taxes over the next three years. While it represents a larger tax increase than the panel first approved, it is still smaller than the one passed by the House. The House bill, which passed on a 380-25 vote last month, would raise $7.1 billion in revenue over three years.    Once the Senate approves the tax package, the House is expected to push for a bigger bill than the Senate's version. With the huge margin of victory in the House, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will stand firm for the House package that would increase taxes for, among others, military contractors and corporations that own stock in other corporations. The tax boost would pay for a series of tax breaks to groups ranging from artists to pistachio farmers.    The tax benefits in the new Finance Committee package include:   --Extending the 20% research and development tax credit for six months. It is scheduled to expire at year end.    --Extending tax breaks for thrifts that rescue troubled thrifts. It would provide the same tax incentive to healthy banks that take over troubled banks as well.    --Extending a tax break for employer-provided education expenses.    --Establishing a taxpayer bill of rights, designed to bolster taxpayers' rights in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.    --Extending a provision that eases the tax treatment of research-and-development expenses that support foreign operations.    --Extending a credit given to employers who hire economically disadvantaged workers.    --Exempting free-lance writers, artists and some livestock producers from a rule that bars taxpayers from deducting certain production expenses before a project produces income.    Most of these provisions are included in the House bill, but are extended for longer periods. But the Senate package doesn't contain a provision to exempt mutual funds from a 1986 tax law requiring that certain investment expenses be deducted by individual shareholders rather than by the fund itself. The House bill would provide this relief to mutual funds.    As in the bill already approved by the Finance Committee, the package would exempt farmers, construction companies and other off-road users of diesel fuel from paying the federal tax on the fuel. Current law requires such users to pay it and apply for a refund at the end of the year. It would also correct technical mistakes in the 1986 bill. </TEXT></DOC>
