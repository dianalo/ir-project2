The French company's statements came on the same day thata published report, citing banking sources, said Square D isseeking about $1 billion in loans in order to effect adefensive recapitalization. Such recaps typically involvepayment of a hefty special dividend to shareholders.</LP><TEXT>   Neither development represented a true watershed in thenine-week fight for control of the Palatine, Ill.,electrical-products concern. But taken together, the itemssuggested that the struggle may be accelerating toward aresolution of some sort.   Investors responded by bidding up Square D shares. Incomposite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday the stockclosed up $2.50 at $81.25 -- substantially above the currentbid price.   Schneider Chairman Didier Pineau-Valencienne, in a letterto his counterpart Jerre Stead at Square D, said he wanted to&quot;re-emphasize&quot; that &quot;Schneider is prepared to discuss apossible price increase&quot; in its all-cash bid, &quot;in the contextof a prompt negotiated combination.&quot;   In New York, a spokesman for Schneider contended theletter doesn't represent a change of strategy: &quot;We've alreadysaid that we're ready to discuss all aspects of theproposal,&quot; he said.   The offer to raise the bid provides an interesting hint,however, that Schneider, which for weeks has been blastingSquare D management for blocking shareholders from acceptingthe $78 offer, may be concerned that its chances ofprevailing aren't as strong as Mr. Pineau-Valencienne wouldlike.   Also yesterday, the American Banker reported that Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co., a Square D financial adviser, has approachedseven U.S. banks to consider helping to finance a leveragedrecapitalization of about $1 billion. The trade journal saidthe plan is in &quot;very preliminary&quot; form at this time.   Square D last week disclosed in a Securities and ExchangeCommission filing that it had agreed to pay fees to certainbanks to have them arrange financing for a defensivetransaction. But it hadn't provided any specifics.   Based on 22.9 million shares outstanding at year end, ifSquare D were to borrow $1 billion and distribute all themoney through a special dividend, holders would receive anindicated one-time payment in excess of $43. Arecapitalization tends to discourage takeovers by increasingthe target company's leverage, while providing shareholderswith a payment that competes with the premium contained in asuitor's bid.   Square D didn't deny or confirm the American Bankerreport. It did say this: &quot;It should come as no surprise toanyone that Square D's board of directors has been activelypursuing a full range of alternatives to Schneider'sinadequate $78-a-share tender offer, or that these optionshave included discussions of some of those alternatives withcommercial banks.&quot; The company also said it is &quot;in theprocess of considering a reply&quot; to Schneider's latest letter.   Most traders had earlier concluded that Schneider's tenderoffer has been temporarily stalled but that the Paris companywould gain control of of its U.S. competitor through a proxychallenge scheduled for a May 24 shareholder vote.</TEXT></DOC>
