Frank Annunzio (D.,Ill.), a member of the House Banking Committee who has beenaccused of excessive coziness with the thrift industry.</LP><TEXT>   When it comes to banks, &quot;regulators quite frankly havemissed a lot,&quot; asserts Senate Banking Committee ChairmanDonald Riegle (D., Mich.), one of the senators rebuked by theEthics Committee for his dealings with savings-and-loanexecutive Charles Keating. &quot;Very little corrective action wastaken early in the game.&quot;   As part of the banking-law overhaul efforts, Rep. Annunzioand Sen. Riegle -- as well as the Bush administration -- areworking on plans that would get the regulators involved introubled situations sooner while cutting down on theirdiscretion in deciding what to do. Under these so-calledprompt-corrective-action proposals, regulators would forcebanks to reduce their dividends, limit their growth and takeother actions if their capital fell below certain levels.High capital, which is basically a bank's net worth, is thebest cushion against failure.   Banks back the concept in principle, but the details couldprove troublesome. They -- and even some regulators -- warnthat if Congress takes things too far, the net result may beto reduce regulatory flexibility needed to minimize theultimate cost to the taxpayer.   &quot;We would be concerned about anything that turns theregulators into robots,&quot; says Edward Yingling, the AmericanBankers Association chief lobbyist, who cites recentregulatory efforts to ease the credit crunch.   Fueling the drive for tougher regulation is Congress'sdesire to avoid the blame for the surge in bank failures andto show that it is doing something to slow the drain on thebank-deposit insurance fund. In the past five years, morefederally insured banks have failed than in the entirepreceding 51 years since the advent of federal depositinsurance in 1934. The bank-insurance fund is at such a lowlevel that Congress will have to vote authority for a newloan program to support the fund; banking committee memberswant to tighten regulation at the same time.   &quot;The basic idea of prompt corrective action is simple,&quot;says Sen. Riegle. &quot;If you want to keep a problem from gettingout of hand, you've got to tackle it while it's stillmanageable.&quot;   Of the prompt-corrective-action proposals currently beforeCongress, the Treasury's and Sen. Riegle's are the mostdetailed. In its blueprint for bank reform, the Treasuryproposed that regulators establish five capital zones.Affiliates of banks in the first tier -- those with capitalsubstantially above minimum requirements -- would be rewardedwith less regulation and would be allowed to expand intononbanking areas, such as securities brokerage and insurance.But banks with lower capital-to-asset ratios would be subjectto tighter regulation, and could be taken over by thegovernment if capital fell too low.   Bankers consider the Riegle plan tougher. If capital fellbelow a minimum level, a bank would have to halt dividendpayments, limit its asset growth by cutting back lending andfile a capital-restoration plan. If capital continued tofall, management raises and bonuses would be halted, andregulators could force the bank to restrict its operations,dismiss its top officials and limit the interest rate itcould pay on deposits. If capital remained below a criticallevel for a certain period, the government would take overthe bank even before it became insolvent.   Sen. Riegle says the goal of his plan is to prevent futureclaims against the fund; the new authority to take overfailing institutions before they're completely broke wouldleave some capital cushion and slow the drain on thebank-insurance fund.   Bankers, though, complain that the Riegle plan would givethe government too much control over banks -- and could evenlead to some being shut down prematurely or unnecessarily.&quot;There has to be administrative responsibility withinlimits,&quot; says former Ohio Democratic Rep. Thomas &quot;Lud&quot;Ashley, a former Banking Committee member who is now thepresident of the Association of Bank Holding Companies.&quot;Plenty of poorly capitalized banks,&quot; he says, can &quot;continueto operate&quot; as they work their way out of problems.   One factor pushing Congress to stronger action is a seriesof reports being released by the General Accounting Office,its auditing and investigating agency. The GAO reportsconclude that regulators -- the Comptroller of the Currency,the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal ReserveBoard -- have so far been too timid in dealing with problembanks.   &quot;Regulators have considerable discretion in choosingwhich, if any, enforcement action to take for identifiedunsafe and unsound practices,&quot; the agency says in the draftof one report. &quot;In addition, for a number of years, they haveoperated under a philosophy of working with cooperative bankmanagement.&quot; In many cases, this combination &quot;was ineffectivein resolving supervisory concerns and in some cases appearedto be an inappropriate response to safety and soundnessconcerns,&quot; the draft report says.   In fact, the report shows that while bank failures weresurging, the number of formal enforcement actions, such ascease-and-desist orders and monetary penalties, fell to 411in 1989 from 814 in 1986.   The GAO believes that regulators must move moreaggressively in response to such potentially risky practicesas high loan concentration in areas such as real estate or asurge in growth that could lead to sloppy procedures. Rep.Annunzio has asked the agency to help him draft a bill thatwould go considerably beyond the Riegle plan by givingregulators authority to become involved in bank managementbefore they see capital deterioration.   But former Rep. Ashley confidently predicts that bankswill be able to hold off what they see as the most intrusiveproposals. &quot;We don't believe any of that rigidity will eversee the light of day,&quot; he says. &quot;Congress won't do it becauseon a bad day in Tiffen, Ohio, the guy you play doubles withwould come up to you and say, `They're closing us downbecause of the new law you passed.'&quot;   But GOP Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania believes some formof toughened regulation is likely. &quot;If we had been better attelling regulators how to do their job, I suspect we wouldprobably have been able to reduce a lot of costs&quot; to thebank-insurance fund, he says.   ---                    A Decade of Failures                                                                                                          The number of banks closed because of financialdifficulty.
