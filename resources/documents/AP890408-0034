ROWE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Southern Californians could get some relief today from a recordheat wave, while North Dakota and Minnesota residents scramble toprotect their homes against what's expected to be some of the worstflooding this century.   In the East, folks bundled up for damp or snowy weather today.   A fourth day of record Southern California heat shut down ahospital emergency room Friday and trapped smog in the valleys.   Downtown Los Angeles had a high of 100 degrees, breaking thedate's record of 88 set in 1904 and tied in 1962. The city reacheda record-tying 100 on Tuesday and had record highs of 105 Wednesdayand 106 Thursday.   In Minnesota and North Dakota, property owners stood in line atemergency management offices to buy sandbags to protect their homesfrom Red River flooding.   ``We just can't keep up,'' said Jim Grondahl, an emergencyservices director in North Dakota. ``We went through another 11,000(bags) this morning and I've got more on order.''   In the East, springtime snows were expected in the northern andcentral Appalachians as well as parts of New England today, thoughlittle accumulation was forecast.   California's Santa Ana weather pattern, which began with warmwinds last weekend and pushed highs into triple digits Tuesday, wasdissipating, and a cooling trend was expected today, NationalWeather Service forecasters said.   Still, the heat maintained a sweltering presence Friday. SanDiego topped out at 93 _ 8 degrees above the 1962 record and 25degrees above normal.   In northern California, records continued to melt away, too.   Santa Cruz recorded the high for the Bay area with 94 degrees,breaking the previous high for the date of 88 set in 1899. San Josecame in with 93 degrees, to beat a 1934 record of 84. SanFrancisco's high of 92 degrees broke the previous record of 81 setin 1939 and set an all-time high for the month of April.   The University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center wasforced to shut its emergency rooms after a 20-minute fire Thursdaynight knocked out the air conditioning.   The blaze in two rooftop air conditioning cooling towers causedno injuries or evacuations. The cooling system was repaired and wasexpected to be cooling off patient wards today, said spokeswomanVicki Beck.   Elsewhere, thousands sought relief at the beaches, but they hadto cross hot-as-griddle sands to reach the ocean.   Lifeguard Randy DeGregori, watching over some of the 60,000people crowded near the water on Santa Monica Beach, figured thesand was 10 or 15 degrees hotter than the air.   First-stage smog alerts were issued for part of the San GabrielValley east of Los Angeles and to the west in the Santa Monicaarea. The alerts mean pollutants were at levels unhealthful foreveryone.   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner asked the state Legislature toallow using up to $1.5 million in profits from a state-run bank tohelp the Red River Valley rebuild after rampant flooding. TheSenate Appropriations Committee on Friday amended Sinner's requestinto the budget.   In Minnesota, the state Senate Finance Committee approved a$250,000 appropriation to provide emergency flood assistance forthe Red River Valley.   The Red River forms the boundary between Minnesota and NorthDakota. The 533-mile river flows north into Lake Winnipeg in Canada.   Runoff from the winter's heavy snowfall sent the river and twoadjoining rivers over their banks earlier this week in thecommunities of Breckenridge, Minn., and Wahpeton, N.D., forcing theevacuation of scores of residents and damaging hundreds of homes.   The river had risen to a level of more than 32 feet Friday andwas expected to crest at 36{ feet late Sunday or Monday, whichwould be the second-worst flood this century in the cities. Theriver rose to 37.3 feet during a 1969 flood. Flood stage is 17 feet.   ``I've lived here a long time and I've never seen it likethis,'' Willard Eckes of Wahpeton said as he surveyed a submergedcity park across the street from his home. ``This is something thatcomes along only once in a lifetime.''</TEXT></DOC>
