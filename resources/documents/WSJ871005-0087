The buyers don't want to get high, just to get well. For this drug distribution system is run by the People With AIDS Health Group in New York, which imports from Germany a bootleg experimental drug called AL-721 for impatient AIDS patients willing to chance the prescribing of their own medications.    Guerrilla clinics, black-market drugs and miscellaneous self-medication are for many patients the only active step they can take against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Before the drug AZT was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March, &quot;There was nothing but wait-and-see,&quot; recalls Martin Delaney, a co-founder of Project Inform, a patient-advocacy group in San Francisco. &quot;And people knew what that meant.&quot;    Now, for the treatment of serious and fatal illnesses, the FDA is offering early distribution and sale of drugs yet to be approved. But that still might not cut into the underground drug trade, which is tolerated by officials. &quot;There are new experimental drugs on the horizon that the FDA won't be able to approve fast enough,&quot; even under its new rules, argues Ronald Koslow, a volunteer with the Project Inform telephone hotline, which directs people to sources of about 10 experimental therapies. The FDA paper work is still monumental, he says, and many people are desperate. &quot;Even if it only takes two months,&quot; he says, &quot;that's a lot for someone who's dying.&quot;    Paul Van Souder, the executive director of the People With AIDS Coalition in New York, complains, &quot;We're six years into the epidemic, and there's still no national policy. People distrust the competence of the federal government and we do, too. People will continue to try to take care of themselves.&quot;    Self-care, of course, is risky. Unapproved drugs come with no guarantee of safety and effectiveness. Many are still being tested. And mixing drugs can be dangerous. Martin Hirsch, a doctor and AIDS researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells patients that if they must choose their own treatment, they at least shouldn't mix AZT and ribavirin -- a current black-market staple. Ribavirin nullifies the benefits of AZT, he says.    Both the San Francisco and New York groups say they counsel safe and responsible self-medication. &quot;We tell people that even with these home treatments, they must be closely monitored by a physician,&quot; says Mr. Koslow of Project Inform. He adds that underground labs exist that will analyze black-market drugs for purity.    Most underground drugs, though less costly to patients than AZT is, aren't cheap. &quot;It's running me $400 a month,&quot; says San Franciscan Tom Jefferson, who suffers AIDS-related complex. For the past 3 1/2 years, he has gone to Mexico for ribavirin and isoprinosine, two experimental antiviral drugs he hopes will stabilize his condition and at least delay the onset of AIDS.    Aubrey Palmer, a San Franciscan suffering AIDS and its characteristic pneumonia, says he mixes his morning orange juice with a bootleg version of the drug AL-721, which is derived from egg yolks. &quot;It isn't unpleasant,&quot; he says. &quot;It tastes kind of sweet.&quot;    AL-721 -- the real thing, not the bootleg -- is made by a Los Angeles company called Ethigen Corp., which questions the purity of the imported version.    Mr. Palmer claims no miracles. &quot;It's hard for me to say it's good for me,&quot; he says, although he recently has started feeling better. &quot;I just hope FDA Commissioner {Frank} Young will get these drugs out. People are dying left and right.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
