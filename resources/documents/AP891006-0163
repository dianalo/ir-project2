The hostages and 20 members of the Federation of Committees ofMothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners were taken away in sixInternational Red Cross vehicles at about 1:30 p.m.   Journalists watched, but police kept them 30 yards away andwould not let reporters talk to evacuees. None of the hostages, oneCosta Rican diplomat 11 Salvadorans employed in the embassy,appeared to be harmed.   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval told reporters thehostages were taken to Red Cross headquarters in San Salvador formedical checks before being sent home, and that the activistsreturned to their organization's office.   He said charges eventually might be filed against some of thoseinvolved.   The government spokesman said some activists who had been armedapparently left their weapons ``inside the offices or hidden,''because they boarded the Red Cross vehicles unarmed.   Those occupying the embassy had insisted they were not armed,but Costa Rican diplomats said they carried weapons.   The Swiss and the Peruvian embassies, which share the six-storyCentral America Building with the Costa Rican mission, were notaffected by the occupation. The Costa Rican Embassy is on the thirdfloor of the building on San Salvador's west side.   The activists arrived in small groups Thursday morning,pretending to be applying for visas, then seized the embassy andtook 16 hostages. They later allowed Ambassador Jesus Fernandez,who had heart trouble, and some employees to leave along withvisitors who were there on business.   Sandoval called the embassy takeover ``an affront to thegovernment and people of Costa Rica ... a violent action that makesno sense.'' He accused the activists of having ``direct links'' toleftist guerrillas who have fought Salvadoran governments for 10years.   A spokeswoman for the activists, who did not give her name, toldreporters earlier the purpose was to protest alleged human rightsviolations by Cristiani's rightist government, which assumed powerJune 1, and bring pressure for ``concrete measures'' to end the war.   For eight years, the federation has protested kidnappings andkillings by rightist death squads of people suspected of leftistsympathies. More than 70,000 people have died in the war andrelated political violence, most of them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
