Along with the request for a supplemental appropriation topay for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Stormthrough March 31, the administration asked for authority tospend contributions from foreign governments. The White Housesaid the $15 billion, along with the funds from othergovernments, should be enough to pay the full costs of thewar if hostilities cease before March 31 and if all thepromised aid arrives.</LP><TEXT>   If those two conditions aren't met, Budget DirectorRichard Darman said, &quot;it may be necessary to seek additionalforeign contributions and/or additional U.S. contributions.&quot;   The supplemental package is likely to face close scrutinyon Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are reluctant to give upauthority over when and how the foreign contributions can bespent by the Pentagon. Already, many lawmakers want to seemore detailed, monthly reports of war costs. There also is awidespread concern that the Pentagon may try to inflatesupplemental requests, including funding for items notdirectly related to the war.   Lawmakers also question some moves to replace tanks,planes and other weapons when the overall U.S. military isshrinking. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin(D., Wis.), for instance, has made it clear that he won'tconsider as legitimate war-related expenditures any requeststo replace equipment &quot;where the future force structure willno longer have a valid requirement for such items.&quot;   Pentagon officials said the supplemental request doesn'tenvision replacing any of the aircraft lost so far in thewar, but they said that could change if many more planes arelost.   The White House estimated that for the period Oct. 1 toMarch 31, U.S. Persian Gulf operations other than actualcombat will result in $40 billion in so-called incrementalcosts, or costs above normal Pentagon operations. Such costsaren't subject to spending limits imposed by last year's U.S.deficit-reduction agreement.   Combat costs could range from $150 million to $1.65billion daily, Mr. Darman said, depending on such factors asthe weather and enemy conduct and tactics. For example, Mr.Darman said, on the first day of the war, 114 Tomahawkmissiles were fired, at a cost of $1.3 million each, but suchmissiles aren't being fired any more. Because of suchvariables, the White House didn't submit an overall estimatefor combat costs.   The White House estimated the cost of maintaining 500,000U.S. troops in the Gulf region from Oct. 1 to March 31 at$21.4 billion, including expenses related to reservecall-ups, transportation, fuel, imminent danger pay andsupport costs.   The White House also budgeted $6.4 billion for equipmentand $7 billion to maintain troops in the Gulf after the war,or &quot;during orderly post-combat phasedown.&quot; And it estimatedat $5.2 billion the cost of returning troops to the U.S. orto other assignments.   To date, foreign governments have promised a total of$53.5 billion to underwrite U.S. costs of fighting the war.The U.S. actually has received $14.9 billion in cash andother contributions, the White House said.   The largest contributors are Persian Gulf states: SaudiaArabia, which has promised $16.8 billion and so far hasdelivered $6 billion; the government of Kuwait, which haspledged $16 billion and delivered $3.5 billion; and theUnited Arab Emirates, which has promised $3 billion anddelivered more than $1 billion. The UAE is considering anadditional contribution, the White House said.   Other contributors include Germany, which has promised$6.5 billion and delivered $2.9 billion; Japan, which haspromised $10.7 billion and delivered $1.3 billion; and SouthKorea, which has promised $385 million and contributed $71million. The White House noted that Japan also has pledged$260 million and South Korea has pledged $15 million tosupport other coalition forces.   Although many members of Congress and some administrationofficials privately have criticized some coalition partnersfor being slow to deliver on promised aid, Mr. Darmanmaintained that &quot;we've had very good results to date&quot; incovering the expenses of the war through foreigncontributions. &quot;Many countries are paying on time, exactly asscheduled,&quot; he said, &quot;and I would think that that will be thepattern in general.&quot;   Mr. Darman said that $11.5 billion in cash contributionsalready has been received, but he noted that Congress mustauthorize its distribution.</TEXT></DOC>
