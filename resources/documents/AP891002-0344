(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   CSX Corp.'s third-quarter profit declined,due in part to the United Mine Workers strike against Pittston CoalGroup Inc., the Richmond-based railroad, barge and naturalresources company said Monday.   CSX said third-quarter earnings totaled $94 million, or 91 centsper share, compared with $120 million, or 75 cents a share, for thesame period last year. Revenue for the quarter totaled $1.9billion, $1 million less than last year's third quarter.   The disparity in the per-share earnings between the two quartersreflects an ongoing share-repurchase program.   In addition to lower coal traffic caused by the ongoing coalstrike, which began April 5, CSX cited an overall weakening of theeconomy's industrial sector as well as service disruptions anddamage caused by Hurricane Hugo for its lower earnings.   The company said earnings for the first nine months of 1989totaled $327 million, or $3.10 per share, compared with earnings of$25 million, or 11 cents a share, for the first nine months of1988. Last year's results reflected a post-tax special charge of$492 million, or $3.16 per share.   Revenue for the first nine months was $5.7 billion, comparedwith $5.5 billion for the same 1988 period.</TEXT></DOC>
