The Bi(4f)core levels show a normal valency of +3 as in Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} and wefind no evidence for the disproportionation of Bi/sup 4+/ to Bi/sup 3+/and Bi/sup 5+/. Instead, we find that BaBiO{sub 3} has mixed valent O/sup2-/ and O/sup 1-/ ions. As the potassium doping is increased, the bindingenergy of the O/sup 2-/ ions in the O(1s) photoelectron spectra steadilydecreases from 529.7 to 528.8 eV. The effect of lowering the O(1s) bindingenergy is to raise the O(2p) band towards E/sub F/ and at the superconductingcomposition a finite density of O(2p) states is observed near E/sub F/.Similarly, the Ba(5p) binding energies decrease with potassium doping,indicating increased metallicity. The behavior of the O(1s), Ba(5p),and the valence band resembles that of all the cuprate superconductorsand we conclude that in all these oxide superconductors, a hole in the(filled) O(2p) band is the carrier responsible for superconductivity,which predicts hole conduction in the Ba-K-Bi-O and Ba-Pb-Bi-O systems.</TEXT></DOC>
