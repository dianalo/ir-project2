(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fiscally speaking, when John Goddard diedhis shirt didn't quite meet his pants.   On balance, that is, he was broke. Having 15 children may nothave helped. Too bad. Just 204 years later, a desk almost certainlymade by him sold for $11 million. Plus 10 percent commission.   John Goddard (1723-85) was a cabinetmaker. He was also an unsungVincent van Gogh of mahogany. You know: Die now, get rich later.Much later.   In the 1760s, Goddard thought, correctly, he was making ahandsome desk-bookcase for a prominent Providence merchant, JohnNicholas Brown. He did not know he would also make tidal waves inthe antique market when Brown's descendant and namesake sold thefamily heirloom through a New York auction house last June.   The $12.1 million price tag quadrupled the previous world recordfor a piece of furniture _ $2.97 million in 1988 for a Louis XVItable once owned by Louis' queen, Marie Antoinette, before theyboth went to the guillotine.   Colonial cabinetmakers, even superstars like Goddard, didn't dierich. Their customers did, instead. The Goddards served them indeath as in life, eking out a living in between masterpieces bymaking coffins. Or hammer handles or cheap furniture for export tothe Caribbean whence came their expensive mahogany logs in return.   Goddard's home, one of the many colonial buildings in thisantique seaport, still stands down on Second Street near Pine. Sodoes his shop, still attached to the three-story, gable-roofedhouse. It's about as big as a one-car garage. If the car is acompact.   John Alden, the Mayflower immigrant, was the first cabinetmakerin the Colonies. His product was crude as a broadax, rough-hewn forthe ages. As the Colonies prospered, hardscrabble utility begansurrendering to refinement. Quality furniture became a confirmationof status, gentility, money.   Wealth in the Colonies concentrated in the seaports.Philadelphia, second largest city in the British Empire, was thecapital of cabinetmaking. Newport by the mid-18th century wasgrowing to 11,000 inhabitants, had more than 50 rum distilleriesand a growing class of entrepreneurs who were becoming rich in thetriangular trade of rum-slaves-sugar cane.   Newport also had a family tribe of Quakers named Townsend andGoddard. Three generations of Townsends and Goddards intermarriednuptially and vocationally, producing a line of some 20cabinetmakers and a golden age of furniture, wooden Parthenons forthe drawing rooms of the rich and famous who could afford the bestand found it, providentially, within walking distance.   John Goddard was born in Dartmouth, Mass., son of a shipwright,one of the crafts along with homebuilding that were to spawn theColonial cabinetmakers. By age 20 he was master of the sloopBashsheda plying between Philadelphia and Newport. In 1746 hemarried Hannah, daughter of local cabinetmaker Job Townsend.Goddard's brother, James, also married a daughter of Job's. Thebrothers began to learn ``the art, trade and mystery'' ofcabinetmaking.   The first good furniture in America was either British importsor copied from English books of design such as Thomas Chippendale's1754 landmark, ``The Gentleman and Cabinetmaker's Director.''Gradually each of the American ports evolved its own style.   Philadelphia's was the most elegant and richly carved. New Yorkwas an unadorned and ``put it there'' kind of town, and so was itsfurniture. Boston was already declining as a seaport. This produceda frugal style that resisted change as well as ostentation. And inNewport, which had 67 cabinetmakers during the century, the best,remember, were Quakers.   The tools of the trade were almost Cro-Magnonian by today'sworkshop standards.   ``All you needed were sharp planes, saws and chisels,'' saysRobert Emlen, the curator who shipped Goddard's desk off theauction block. ``They finished wood with scrapers, pumice androttenstone or sharkskin. But for that you had to find a shark.''   ``Screws were expensive, and they were only used whereabsolutely needed,'' says Jeff Moore, who restores furniture forthe Newport Preservation Society. ``They used hide glue _ it'sstill holding. Blacksmiths made files. And they had molding planesand jointer planes and rifflers and sandpaper made out of crushedglass glued to paper. They weren't fools. They did it the easy waywherever they could.''   Humbler woods were used where they wouldn't be seen. But thevisible mahogany surfaces were flawlessly carved and dovetailed.   Future cabinetmakers apprenticed for seven years beginning atabout age 13. After the dog work, they became journeymen, travelingfrom job to job until they acquired enough rifflers and planes andsharks to open their own shops. Roughly, it took a journeyman eightdays to make a 4-foot table, six days for a plain desk, 22 days fora highboy.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
