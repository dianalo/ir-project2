South Africa's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, saidat a ceremony that nearly 1,000 soldiers crossed into South-WestAfrica during the day to complete the first phase of aU.S.-mediated regional peace initiative.   ``As of this moment, we are out of Angola,'' Gleeson said.   The peace effort is aimed at ending a 13-year-old war in Angola,whose Marxist government is backed by thousands of Cuban troops.After a Cuban withdrawal from Angola, South Africa says it willgrant independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   An estimated 2,500 South African troops, some of them 180 milesinside in Angola, have been leaving in stages since a cease-firewas declared Aug. 8. They supported the National Union for theTotal Independence of Angola, or UNITA.   UNITA, also backed by the United States, is not party to thecease-fire and was exclued from recent peace talks between Angola,Cuba, South Africa under U.S. mediation.   The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week inBrazzaville, Congo, but failed to agree on timetables forwithdrawal of the estimated 50,000 troops in Angola and Namibianindependence. More talks are planned for Brazzaville next week.   Gleeson said there were no truce violations. But later a seniorofficial of South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department complainedCuban forces were put on ``red alert'' during the withdrawal.   ``This is hardly the action of an army sure of itself or oneaiming at peace, but rather one aiming for a return tohostilities,'' said the diplomat, Glenn Babb.   South African and foreign journalists were flown to Rundu, onthe Angolan border, to witness the completion of the withdrawal bySouth African forces, which have been inside Angola since early1987.   Cuban and Angolan officers serving on a cease-fire monitoringcommittee also attended the ceremony while soldiers dismantled thebridge across the Okavango River.   ``Our governments have shown the world that we will pursuepeace,'' said Angolan Maj. Osvaldo van Dunem. ``We hope to continuein the spirit of mutual understanding and sincerity.''   The South African trucks crossing into Rundu carried troops andsupplies, and some towed giant G-5 long-range cannon across theshallow river while villagers washed their clothes nearby.   Many of the vehicles had graffiti on them, such as ``No retreat,no surrender'' and ``Hello, mom.'' They drove into a compound thathad a banner that said ``Welcome, winners.''   Angola is to try to keep guerrillas of the South-West AfricanPeople's Organization at least 150 miles north of the Namibianborder, Gleeson said. He said SWAPO has said it will observe acease-fire starting Sept. 1 but hasn't commented on whether itsguerrillas will move away from the border area.   Gleeson said South Africa will not conduct any more ``hotpursuit'' raids into Angola after SWAPO units.   The Cubans reportedly have been offering to leave Angola in 24months, apparently still too slow for the South Africans.   ``We are not in a rush'' to leave Angola, said Cuban Col. JesusFalcon in Rundu. ``We are aiming to accomplish the tasks of ourgovernment.''   Cuba's often-stated goal is to ensure the survival of Angola'sgovernment. A hasty Cuban withdrawal could leave the governmentvulnerable to UNITA, which controls about one-third of the country.   South Africa has intervened in Angola regularly since 1975 whenit invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence fromPortugal. South African generals said their maximum strength inAngola was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force wastwice that size during battles last October.   News reports monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday saidAngolan government soldiers clashed last week with UNITA rebels.   Rebels killed eight people traveling in a bus belonging to theinternational humanitarian organization CARITAS on Thursday, theofficial Angolan news agency ANGOP said.   UNITA, in a statement also released in Lisbon, said it killed 10government soldiers and captured two others in three separateclashes Friday and Saturday. The statement gave rebel casualties asfour killed and 11 wounded.   The Portuguese news agency Lusa added that 20 other Angolanswere killed in three other rebel ambushes in recent days.</TEXT></DOC>
