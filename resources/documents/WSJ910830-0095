The suit demands $2 billion in damages and injunctiverelief.</LP><TEXT>   AMD's suit is the latest salvo in a series of legalskirmishes between the chip makers over AMD's attempts tomake chips that mimic Intel's popular microprocessors. Thesuit comes at a time when Federal Trade Commission lawyersare conducting an informal investigation of Intel's businesspractices to decide whether the Santa Clara, Calif., companyhas violated antitrust laws.   By taking Intel to court, AMD, Sunnyvale, Calif., willtest charges that Intel's critics have long held against it-- charges that Intel abuses its monopoly of microprocessorsthat are the &quot;brains&quot; of most PCs, that it divvies out scarcechips improperly and that it unfairly crowds competitors outof the market.   &quot;I think AMD has some substance here behind theiraccusations,&quot; said analyst Richard Whittington of KidderPeabody, &quot;based on a pattern of comments we get from computercompanies and distributors.&quot;   Intel's chief executive, Andrew Grove, called the suit&quot;ridiculous.&quot; He added, &quot;What we have here is the MilliVanilli of semiconductors. Their last original idea was tocopy Intel. Since they can't win in the marketplace, they tryto defeat us in the courts and press.&quot;   A major part of the suit, filed in federal court in SanJose, Calif., is AMD's charge that Intel secretly conspiredto thwart a 1982 agreement that was meant to give AMD therights to make Intel's 386 chip. Intel subsequently refusedto let AMD make the chip. The suit alleges that &quot;Intelexecutives, upset at AMD's actual success in the marketplace. . . contrived to use the contract as a weapon to destroyAMD as a competitor by gradually depriving AMD of access&quot; tofuture chips.   AMD also charges in its suit that Intel planned tomonopolize the microprocessor market by keeping AMD out ofthe business. The companies are in arbitration over theagreement. An arbitration judge last year ruled that Intelacted in bad faith by scotching the deal, but the judgehasn't determined damages yet. AMD's suit requests damagesfor, among other things, lost profits during the time itdidn't have a 386 chip on the market.   AMD also charges Intel with refusing to sell its popular386 microprocessors to customers unless they bought otherproducts as well, a tactic called &quot;tying.&quot; Intel's rivals andofficials at some PC companies have for years complainedprivately that Intel was tying 386 sales to sales of older286 chips, especially in Asian markets. But AMD is the firstcompany to publicly charge Intel of the practice.   Tying is illegal if the company has a large market shareof the product in question. Intel held a 100% share of the386-chip market until March, when AMD began shipping itsclone of the chip. AMD, in the suit, also charges Intel with&quot;inducing computer manufacturers and distributors to refuseto deal with AMD in the purchase&quot; of 386 chips and ofrefusing to sell 386 chips to some PC makers.   Antitrust lawyers said an FTC probe of Intel may have beensparked by earlier private complaints to the agency from AMD,as the chip company prepared to sue. FTC officials earlierthis year questioned at least two companies that have alreadyfiled antitrust suits against Intel: chip maker Cyrix Corp.of Richardson, Texas, which charges that Intel conspired tokeep it out of business by intimidating customers; and TokyoCobra Corp., an Irvine, Calif., distributor that sued Intelfor cutting off chip supplies.   The FTC's informal probe of Intel may dig up evidence thatwill help AMD's suit, said John F. Young, an antitrust lawyerin San Francisco. Still, AMD will need many &quot;smoking guns&quot; inthe form of internal documents or Intel customers who cangive anecdotal evidence of Intel's pressure on them, he said.&quot;They're making very specific allegations. These aren'tsimple claims to prove.&quot;   Ironically, AMD has been gaining more market share thisyear than it expected from sales of its 386 clones, whichhave pulled the company out of a chain of unprofitablequarters. AMD's clones, used mainly by Asian and smaller U.S.PC makers, are beginning to woo a few staunch Intelcustomers. AST Research Inc. of Irvine, Calif., for example,plans to unveil a notebook machine using an AMD clone, the386SX-25, next month.   Still, AMD has been frustrated by a reluctance to useAMD's clones among PC makers, who are sheepish about jiltingIntel, said Mr. Whittington, the analyst. &quot;It's in AMD'sinterest to stage a theatrical effect to get rid of thatlogjam,&quot; he added.   Intel's stock was quoted at $51.25, down 50 cents, innational over-the-counter trading yesterday afternoon. AMD'sstock was quoted at $12.125, unchanged, on the New York StockExchange.</TEXT></DOC>
