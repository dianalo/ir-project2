SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan contended Saturday that thenation's deficit could be ``ancient history in no time'' if thepresident had more power over the budget process.   Reagan, who leaves office in less than five weeks, used hisweekly radio address to blame Congress once again for the nation'sdeficit spending habits.   ``Every dime of deficit spending has been mandated by Congress,''Reagan said in the address, delivered from the Oval Office.   ``Under the Constitution, only Congress can spend money; thepresident can't appropriate a penney,'' Reagan said.   In the 1988 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the nationrecorded a $155.1 billion deficit. Under the Gramm-Rudman budgetbalancing law, a $100 billion deficit target has been set for the1990 fiscal year.   ``The verdict is in. The current system does not work,'' Reagansaid.   Reagan did not mention his successor, President-elect Bush, buthe did argue that the nation's red ink woes can be solved withoutraising taxes, a pledge Bush made in his campaign.   Reagan is required under the law to submit another budget on Jan.9, and it is expected that he will include many of his budget reformrecommendations in that spending plan.   Saying, ``The only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting theincreases in spending,'' Reagan said his final budget will reducethe deficit target by some $35 billion for the 1990 fiscal year andmeet the Gramm-Rudman target.   The president also contended that his budget plan will do so``without touching Social Security or raising taxes.''   ``Economic growth will increase revenues by $80 billion withoutnew taxes. Just by holding spending increases to less than $80billion, we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track for abalanced budget by 1993,'' Reagan said.   Bush has the option of scrapping Reagan's entire budget if hewants and submitting his won proposal after he takes office Jan. 20.   Bush has declined to say whether he will submit his own plan, buthas said he wants to open negotiations with Congress over ways toreduce the deficit.   As he has many times in during his two terms, Reagan used hisfive-minute address to argue for an array of changes in the budgetprocess. Many of them grant more power to the president rather toCongress and have therefore met stiff opposition on Capitol Hill.   They include presidential authority to veto individual items inappropriations bills, a constitutional amendment requiring abalanced budget, and granting the president authority not to spendmoney that Congress has appropriated, among others.   ``Congress must reform its faulty budget process and we need abalanced budget amendment to the Constitution so that the federalgovernment does not spend more than it takes in,'' Reagan said.   ``After I leave office next month, I will campaign for thesereforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaignfor the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve thesereforms, the deficit will be ancient history in no time,'' Reagansaid.</TEXT></DOC>
