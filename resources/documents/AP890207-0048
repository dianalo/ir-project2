The so-called Recruit scandal has shaken public confidence inJapan's government. Three members of Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita's Cabinet have resigned because of links to the affair, ashave more than a dozen other government officials, business leadersand media executives.   Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party,stepped down today amid pressure from party members who want todistance the party from the scandal. He said he was not guilty ofany wrongdoing and was quitting for the party' sake.   ``If my resignation can bring gains for the party, I decided itis better for me to withdraw now,'' he told a news conference. ``Iwould like to apologize to my colleagues and to the people fortroubles caused by my involvement in the Recruit scandal.''   ``I believe my innocence was widely understood by my supporters,but I also could not overlook the fact that some of my colleaguesare concerned about the next election,'' he said, referring toupcoming voting in July for half the seats in the House ofCouncillors, the upper house of parliament.   Tsukamoto will retain his seat in the House of Representatives.   The Democratic Socialist Party, with 29 of 512 seats, is thethird largest opposition bloc after the Japan Socialist Party andthe Komeito, the Clean Government Party.   Since last summer, the Recruit scandal has become a subject ofnational debate as it highlighted the sometimes dubious connectionsbetween business and politics.   Tsukamoto bought 10,000 unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., areal estate subsidiary of the information-based conglomerate RecruitCo., through his secretary, and earned about $77,000 by selling themimmediately after the company went public in 1986.   Pressure had mounted on Tsukamoto to resign because he was theonly one of four opposition politicians linked to the scandal whohad not taken responsibility for their roles.   The three others have given up party posts or parliament seats.Tsukamoto was first implicated in the scandal in October.   Though the stock transactions were not illegal under Japanesesecurities law, they had a taint of bribery and influence-peddling.   Prosecutors have questioned Recruit executives as well asgovernment officials in a bribery probe, and reportedly are preparedto arrest several public officials for allegedly profiting fromprivileged access to prelisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co. inexchange for doing favors for the company.   Prime Minister Takeshita tried to erase the shadow of the scandalby reshuffling his administration last December, but two Cabinetmembers _ Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa and Ken Harada, directorgeneral of the Economic Planning Agency _ have since quit because oflinks to Recruit.   Takeshita himself is tied to the scandal because his secretarybought pre-listed shares in Recruit-Cosmos, but the prime ministerdenied any knowledge of the deal and has ruled out oppositiondemands to resign and call early elections.   The moderate Democratic Socialist Party will likely toughen itsstance against the ruling party in Parliament now that itsscandal-tainted chairman is stepping down.   Tsukamoto's resignation also will likely fuel opposition demandsthat Takeshita resign.</TEXT></DOC>
