Background</ITAG>On June 27, 1988, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA orthe Act) was enacted into law. EPPA prohibits most private employers (Federal,State and local government employers are exempted from the Act) from usingany lie detector tests either for pre-employment screening or during thecourse of employment. In addition, testing by the Federal Government ofexperts, consultants, or employees of Federal contractors engaged in nationalsecurity intelligence or counterintelligence functions is permitted. Thelaw contains several limited exemptions which authorize polygraph testsunder certain conditions, including: (1) The testing of employees who arereasonably suspected of involvement in a workplace incident that resultsin economic loss or injury to the employer's business; (2) the testingof some prospective employees of private armored car, security alarm, andsecurity guard firms; and (3) the testing of some current and prospectiveemployees in firms authorized to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlledsubstances. Employers who violate any of the Act's provisions may be assessedcivil money penalties up to $10,000.While the law provides for an effective date six months from the date ofenactment, it also provides that the Secretary of Labor issue appropriateregulations ``not later than 90 days after the date of enactment.'' Giventhe constraints of time and the statutory mandate to issue final regulationswithin 90 days of enactment, the Department of Labor is publishing thisfinal rule on an interim basis, simultaneously inviting comments from interestedparties. After review of the comments, the Department will either issuea proposal or a final regulation, based on the comments received.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Recordkeeping requirements contained in the regulation (andSection; 801.30)are being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) for review.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average as follows: 1. (A) Written Notice to Examinee of Polygraph Testing_5minutes per response; (B) Additional Information in Notice to Examineeof Polygraph Testing for Ongoing Investigations_\1/2\ hour per response;2. Written Notice to Polygraph Examiner Identifying Persons to be Examined_5minutes per response; 3. Written Notice of Test Results to Examinee Priorto Adverse Action_1 minute per response; 4. Record of number of tests conducteddaily and length of each test_\1/2\ minute per response; 5.

Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to the Office of Information Management, U.S. Department ofLabor, Room N-1301, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210;and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Rule</ITAG>The regulations in this Part are divided into six subparts. Subpart A containsthe provisions generally applicable to covered employers, including therequirements relating to the prohibitions on lie detector use and the postingof notices. Subpart A also sets forth interpretations regarding the effectof section 10 of the Act on other laws or collective bargaining agreements.Subpart B sets forth rules regarding the statutory exemptions from applicationof the Act. Subpart C sets forth the restrictions on polygraph usage undersuch exemptions. Subpart D sets forth the recordkeeping requirements andthe rules on disclosure of polygraph test information. Subpart E dealswith the authority of the Secretary of Labor and the enforcement provisionsunder the Act. Subpart F contains the procedures and rules of practicenecessary for the administrative enforcement of the Act.The Department met informally with outside parties who provided backgroundinformation with respect to the preparation of this rule. Included in suchmeetings were representatives of security service companies and relatedtrade associations; representatives of retail trade associations; representativesof the polygraph industry; and representatives of trade associations involvedwith controlled substances. Meetings were also held with officials of theDrug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Defense.In developing this rule, a number of issues have been identified and explored.The Department has tentatively resolved these issues as described below,and it particularly invites comments on the following issues:(1) The legislative intent as to the scope of the security service industryexemption is not entirely clear on the treatment of employees hired toinstall alarms in or guard commercial or retail establishments and residences.We have tentatively concluded that the section 7(e)(1)(B) exemption doesnot apply to security guard or security alarm firms protecting privatehomes or businesses not primarily engaged in the handling, trading, transferring,or storing of the assets enumerated in the statute. There is an argument,however, that the exemption should be interpreted more broadly, so as toinclude such employees. If the exemption were so interpreted, it appearsthat virtually all employees in this industry would be subject to pre-employmentpolygraph tests. Such an interpretation is not easily reconciled with thelanguage of the statute itself, which identifies specific types of securitywork as included within the exemption. Comment is specifically invitedon the scope of the exemption as provided in andSection; 801.14.(2) The Congress specifically directed the Department to develop regulationswhich would list the types of ``facilities, materials, or operations''having a significant impact on the health or safety of any State or politicalsubdivision or the national security. It is evident the legislative intentwas to protect the safety and health of the general public. The Departmenthas listed a number of such ``facilities, materials, or operations'' inandSection; 801.14(i). Comments are specifically requested on the scope ofthis list.(3) The rule broadly interprets the term ``prospective employee'' for purposesof the security service and controlled substance exemptions. In particular,current employees of the employer, who were initially hired to performduties which do not fall within the scope of the exemptions (and who, therefore,are not subject to pre-employment polygraph tests), could be tested as``prospective employees'' the first time (only) they are re-assigned orpromoted to a position with duties that do fall within the scope of theexemptions. We have found no pertinent legislative history on this issue.We believe, however, that some latitude is necessary in the definitionof ``prospective employee'' for purposes of the exemption, so that currentemployees of an employer will not be unfairly disadvantaged, with respectto non-employees, in competition for positions which may be subject tothe exemption. We believe that this construction, contained in andSection;andSection;801.13(d) and 801.14(b), is reasonable, given the realities of the workplace.(4) Except as noted above, the rule makes no allowances for pre-employmenttesting to be conducted after an applicant is initially hired by an employer.It has been suggested that there are situations in which it is not feasibleor practical to conduct the test prior to the actual hiring date and thatit would be consistent with the purposes of the Act to permit testing subsequentto hiring in some circumstances. Comment is invited on the question whetherit would be consistent with the Act to permit such testing. If so, underwhat circumstances, and what would be a reasonable period (e.g., one day,one week, one month) subsequent to hiring in which such testing shouldbe permitted?(5) The rule interprets the terms ``direct access'' and ``access'' differentlyfor purposes of the controlled substance exemption (andSection; 801.13).This, ``direct access'', which is one of the elements necessary for pre-employmenttesting, is more narrowly defined than ``access'', an element requiredfor testing of current employees during an ongoing investigation. In thelatter case, however, the ``access'' must be to the specific person orproperty that is the subject of the investigation. The Department believesthis interpretation is consistent with the statute and legislative history.(6) The legislative history of the Act indicates Congress' intention thatthe controlled substance exemption not be applicable to truck drivers andthat the exemption extend only to persons or entities registered with theDrug Enforcement Administration. The Controlled Substances Act exemptsfrom registration requirements comon or contract carriers and warehouseswhose possession of a controlled substance is in the usual course of theirbusiness. Accordingly, andSection; 801.13(b)(2) excludes employees of commonor contract carriers or public warehouses from this exemption.(7) Inventory shortages are common throughout many industries. Section801.12 is intended to preclude the mere existence of an inventory shortage,in and of itself, from being a basis for testing of current employees sinceit does not meet the specific incident requirement of the exemption. Arethe safeguards in the rule sufficient to prevent the random testing ofemployees, or classes of employees, on a routine or regular basis?(8) The Act provides several examples of events which would constitutean economic loss or injury for purposes of the ongoing investigation exemption,including theft, embezzlement, and sabotage. Section 801.12 adds otherexamples, including check-kiting and money-laundering, which were containedin the legislative history. Comment is invited on the question whetherthere are other examples, or other classes of activity, which should beincluded in the scope of ``economic loss'' for purposes of this exemption.(9) Section 801.14 defines the statutory term ``primary business purpose''to mean the activity from which 50 percent or more of the employer's businessincome is derived. Thus, at least 50 percent of an employer's annual dollarvolume of business must be derived from the types of security activitieswithin the scope of the exemption in order for the exemption to apply.Would some alternative definition of ``primary business purpose'' bettereffectuate the statutory scheme, or be more workable?(10) The Act requires that individuals must be given ``reasonable writtennotice'' of the date, time, location and other information about a polygraphtest. Sections 801.12(g)(2) and 801(c)(1)(A) define ``reasonable'' as atleast 48 hours prior to the examination. Should some other minimum timeframe be used to define ``reasonable'', and if so, why?<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This rule is not classified as a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291on Federal Regulations, because it is not likely to result in: (1) An annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State orlocal government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreignenterprises in domesic or export markets. Therefore no regulatory impactanalysis is required. The Department's determination that the regulation is not subject to aregulatory impact analysis is based on the following: (a) The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost for EPPA to be $1million to the Federal Government and that EPPA will have no impact onState and local governments. (b) Further, the legislative history on EPPA shows a lack of any evidencethat internal theft rates are higher in States which prohibit the use ofpolygraph tests. Also, there are no conclusive studies which show thatpolygraph testing reduces employee crime. (c) Section 7 of EPPA permits certain employers to continue to conductpolygraph testing and permits all employers to request an employee to takea test, under certain conditions, when it is administered as part of anongoing investigation. Consequently, any economic costs due to increasedtheft attributable to the absence of polygraph testing will be minimized.(d) The net employment effect of EPPA will not be significant. As employersturn to different hiring procedures and screening techniques, employmentgains in the occupations associated with these alternative hiring procedureswill offset any employment loss in the polygraph testing field. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to prepare regulatoryflexibility analyses, and to develop alternatives whenever possible, indrafting regulations that will have ``a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities.'' The following analysis assessesthe impact of these regulations on small entities required by the Act.(1) Reasons Why Action by Agency Is Being Considered On June 27, 1988 the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 was enactedinto law. This Act, which is effective December 27, 1988, generally preventsemployers engaged in interstate commerce from using any lie detector tests,with certain exemptions, either for pre-employment screening or duringthe course of employment. Section 5 of the Act requires the Secretary ofLabor to promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carryout the Act. This interim final rule is being issued to implement the Act.(2) Objectives of and Legal Basis for Rule This interim final rule is issued pursuant to section 5 of the EmployeePolygraph Protection Act of 1988. Its objective is to enable employersand polygraph examiners to comply with the requirements of the Act, andto advise employees and job applicants of the protections afforded by theAct. (3) Number of Small Entities Covered Under Rule This interim final rule is applicable to all private sector employers engagedin or affecting ``commerce'' or in the production of goods for ``commerce''.The scope of the term ``commerce'' is accorded the same meaning as providedby section 3(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(b)).Approximately 6.5 million employers are covered by these regulations, andthe majority of such employers would be classified as small entities. Inaddition, these regulations contain provisions applying to over 3,500 polygraphexaminers and an undetermined number of others who administer lie detector-typetests, most of which are prohibited by the Act. It is estimated that nearlyall of these examiners are either individual practitioners or associatedwith firms that would be classified as small entities. (4) Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements of the RuleThe interim final rule establishes recordkeeping requirements for employerswith respect to the maintenance and preservation of records for each polygraphtest administered, as well as for each polygraph examiner who administerssuch tests on behalf of employers. (5) Relevant Federal Rules Duplicating, Overlapping or Conflicting Withthe Rule There is no duplication of existing Wage-Hour requirements, nor is similarinformation required by any other Federal agency or statute. (6) Differing Compliance and Recordkeeping Requirements The language sets forth in this interim final regulation closely adheresto the requirements imposed by the language of the Act and accompanyinglegislative history. The burdens imposed by these requirements on employers,and the polygraph examiners used by employers, are those imposed by statute,and those necessary to enforce the statute. However, in developing this interim final rule, consideration was givento requiring a standard form for written statements which employers mustprovide to examinees, in certain instances, as a condition for administeringpolygraph tests under the several exemptions to the Act's general prohibitionof such tests. For example, an employer is required to furnish an employeewith a written statement setting the employee's rights under the law, priorto administering a polygraph test. It was concluded that employers, especiallysmall entities, should have the flexibility to formulate and maintain suchrequired written statements in any order or form deemed most appropriateto their needs, and that standard formats would not be required. However,to assist such employers, a sample format is set forth in the Appendixto this Part. (7) Clarification, Consolidation and Simplification of Compliance and ReportingRequirements As noted above, the recordkeeping requirements in this interim final ruleare those imposed by statute, and those necessary to determine compliancewith the Act. Employers are permitted to use any format that meets enforcementand compliance needs. (8) Use of Other Standards Appropriate alternative standards that would impose fewer regulatory burdenson covered employers, especially small entities, are not available. (9) Exemptions of Small Entities from Coverage of the Rule An exemption from the requirements of the interim final rule for smallentities is not permitted by the provisions of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Publication as an Interim Final Rule </ITAG>Request for Comments The Secretary has determined that the public interest requires the immediateissuance of these interim final regulations in order to comply with thestatutory requirement that regulations be issued well in advance of theeffective date of the Act. Insufficient time existed since the enactmentof the EPPA for the Department to issue an in-depth proposal for comments,review the comments, and promulgate a final rule in the time provided bythe Act. The failure to have this rule in place substantially in advance of theeffective date of the Act (December 27, 1988) would lead to unnecessary,unwarranted and potentially costly uncertainty on the part of affectedemployers, employees, job applicants, and polygraph examiners, concerningthe scope of the statutory coverage and of the exemptions thereunder andconcerning their rights and obligations under the Act. Accordingly, the Secretary finds good cause, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B),that prior notice and public comment are impracticable and contrary tothe public interest. However, interested persons are invited to submitcomments on this regulation by February 27, 1989. Following evaluationof the comments received, a proposed rule or a final regulation, modifiedas necessary, will be published.

L. 100-347, 102 Stat. 646, 29 U.S.C. 2001-2009).(b) (1) The term ``commerce'' has the meaning provided in section 3(b)of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(b)). As so defined,``commerce'' means trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communicationamong the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof.(2) The term ``State'' means any of the fifty States and the District ofColumbia and any Territory or possession of the United States.(c) The term ``employer'' means any person acting directly or indirectlyin the interest of an employer in relation to an employee or prospectiveemployee. A polygraph examiner either employed for or whose services areretained for the sole purpose of administering polygraph tests ordinarilywould not be deemed an ``employer'' with respect to the examinees.(d) (1) The term ``lie detector'' means a polygraph, deceptograph, voicestress analyzer, psychological stress evaluator, or any other similar device(whether mechanical or electrical) that is used, or the results of whichare used, for the purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding thehonesty or dishonesty of an individual.(2) The term ``lie detector'' does not include medical tests used to determinethe presence or absence of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily fluids.Also not included in the definition of ``lie detector'' are written ororal tests commonly referred to as ``honesty'' or ``paper and pencil''tests, machine-scored or otherwise.(e) The term ``polygraph'' means an instrument that_(1) Records continuously, visually, permanently, and simultaneously changesin cardiovascular, respiratory, and electrodermal patterns as minimum instrumentationstandards; and(2) Is used, or the results of which are used, for the purpose of renderinga diagnostic opinion regarding the honesty or dishonesty of an individual.(f) The terms ``manufacture'', ``dispense'', ``distribute'', and ``deliver''have the meanings set forth in the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.802.(g) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Labor or authorized representative.(h) ``Employment Standards Administration'' means the agency within theDepartment of Labor, which includes the Wage and Hour Division.(i) ``Wage and Hour Division'' means the organizational unit in the EmploymentStandards Administration of the Department of Labor to which is assignedprimary responsibility for enforcement and administration of the Act.(j) ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division,or authorized representative.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 801.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Coverage.</ITAG>Any employer engaged in or affecting commerce or in the production of goodsfor commerce is subject to the provisions of the Act, unless otherwiseexempt pursuant to section 7 of the Act and andSection;andSection; 801.10 through801.14 of this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 801.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Prohibitions on lie detector use.</ITAG>Section 3 of EPPA provides that, unless otherwise exempt pursuant to section7 of the Act and andSection;andSection; 801.10 through 801.14 of this part,covered employers are prohibited from:(a) Requiring, requesting, suggesting or causing, directly or indirectly,any employee or prospective employee to take or submit to a lie detectortest;(b) Using, accepting, or inquiring about the results of a lie detectortest of any employee or prospective employee; and(c) Discharging, disciplining, discriminating against, denying employmentor promotion, or threatening any employee or prospective employee to takesuch action for refusal or failure to take or submit to such test, on thebasis of the results of a test, for filing a complaint, for testifyingin any proceeding, or for exercising any rights afforded by the Act.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;801.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Effect on other laws or agreements.   </ITAG>(a) Section 10 of EPPA provides that the Act, except for subsections (a),(b), and (c) of section 7, does not preempt any provision of a State orlocal law, or any provision of a collective bargaining agreement, thatprohibits lie detector tests or is more restrictive with respect to theuse of lie detector tests.   (b) (1) This provision applies to all aspects of the use of lie detectortests, including procedural safeguards, the use of test results, the rightsand remedies provided examinees, and the rights, remedies, and responsibilitiesof examiners and employers.   (2) For example, if the State prohibits the use of polygraphs in all privateemployment, polygraph examinations could not be conducted pursuant to thelimited exemptions provided in the Act; a collective bargaining agreementthat provides greater protection to an examinee would apply in additionto the protection provided in the Act; or more stringent licensing or bondingrequirements in a State law would apply in addition to the Federal bondingrequirement.   (e) On the other hand, industry exemptions and applicable restrictionsthereon, provided in EPPA, would preempt less restrictive exemptions establishedby State law for the same industry, e.g., random testing of current employeesin the drug industry not prohibited by State law but limited by this Actto tests administered in connection with ongoing investigations.    (c) EPPA does not impede the ability of State and local governments toenforce existing statutes or to enact subsequent legislation restrictingthe use of lie detectors with respect to public employees.

An employer may request an employee, subject to the conditionsset forth in sections 8 and 10 of the Act and andSection;andSection; 801.20,801.22, 801.23, and 801.35 of this part, to submit to a polygraph test,but no other type of lie detector test, only if_(1) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing investigationinvolving economic loss or injury to the employer's business, such as theft,embezzlement, misappropriation or an act of industrial espionage or sabotage;(2) The employee has access to the property that is the subject of theinvestigation;(3) The employer has a reasonable suspicion that the employee was involvedin the incident or activity under investigation; (4) The employer provides the examinee with a statement, in a languageunderstood by the examinee, prior to the test which fully explains withparticularity the specific incident or activity being investigated andthe basis for testing particular employees and which contains, at a minimum:(i) An identification with particularity of the specific economic lossor injury to the business of the employer;(ii) A statement specifically describing the employee's access to the propertythat is the subject of the investigation; (iii) A statement describing in detail the basis of the employer's reasonablesuspicion that the employee was involved in the incident or activity underinvestigation; and (iv) Signature of a person (other than a polygraph examiner) authorizedto legally bind the employer; and (5) The employer retains a copy of the statement described in paragraph(a)(4) of this section for at least 3 years and makes it available forinspection by the Wage and Hour Division on request. (See andSection; 801.30(a).)(b) For the exemption to apply, the condition of an ``ongoing investigation''must be met. As used in section 7(d) of the Act, the ongoing investigationmust be of a specific incident or activity. Thus, for example, an employermay not request that an employee or employees submit to a polygraph testin an effort to determine whether or not any thefts have occurred. Suchrandom testing by an employer is specifically precluded by the Act. Further,by limiting the exemption to a specific incident or activity, an employeris precluded from using the exemption in situations where the so-called``ongoing investigation'' is continuous. For example, the fact that itemsin inventory are frequently missing from a warehouse would not be a sufficientbasis for administering a polygraph test. Even if the employer can establishthat unusually high amounts of inventory are missing from the warehousein a given month, this, in and of itself, would not be sufficient basisto meet the specific incident requirement without evidence of intentionalwrongdoing. Administering a polygraph test in such circumstances, withoutidentification of a specific incident or activity and a ``reasonable suspicionthat the employee was involved'' would amount to little more than a fishingexpedition. (c) (1) The term ``economic loss or injury to the employer's business''includes losses or injuries resulting from theft, embezzlement, misappropriation,industrial espionage or sabotage. These examples, cited in the Act, areintended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. Other specific incidentswhich would meet the economic loss or injury requirement include check-kiting,money laundering, or the misappropriation of confidential or trade secretinformation. Similarly, instances such as theft from property managed byan employer, or property held by an employer as a fiduciary or custodian,would meet the required injury standard.(2) The eonomic loss must result from intentional wrongdoing. Thus, losseswhich would not serve as a basis for the administration of a polygraphtest include those apparently unintentional losses stemming from a truck,car, workplace or other similar type accidents. Any economic loss incidentto lawful union or employee activity also would not satisfy this requirement.(3) It is the business of the employer which must suffer the economic lossor injury. Thus, a theft committed by one employee against another employeeof the same employer would not satisfy the requirement. (d) While nothing in the Act prohibits the use of medical tests to determinethe presence of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily fluids, thesection 7(d) exemption does not permit the use of a polygraph test to learnwhether an employee has used drugs or alcohol, even where such possibleuse may have contributed to an economic loss to the employer (e.g., anaccident involving a company vehicle). (e) Section 7(d)(2) provides that, as a condition for the use of the exemption,the employee must have had access to the property that is the subject ofthe investigation.(1) The word ``access'', as used in section 7(d)(2), refers to the opportunitywhich an employee had to cause, or to aid or abet in causing, the specificeconomic loss or injury under investigation. The term ``access'', thus, includes more than direct or physical contactduring the course of employment. For example, all employees working inor with authority to enter a warehouse storage area have ``access'' tothe property in the warehouse. All employees with the combination to asafe have ``access'' to the property in a locked safe. Employees also have``access'' who have the ability to divert possession or otherwise affectthe disposition of the property that is the subject of investigation. Forexample, a bookkeeper in a jewelry store with access to inventory recordsmay aid or abet a clerk who steals an expensive watch by removing the watchfrom the employer's inventory records. In such a situation, it is clearthat the bookkeeper effectively has ``access'' to the property that isthe subject of the investigation.(2) As used in section 7(d)(2), ``property'' refers to specifically identifiableproperty, but also includes such things of value as security codes andcomputer data, and proprietary financial or technical information whichby its availability to competitors or others would cause economic harmto the employer. (f)(1) As used in section 7(d)(3), the term ``reasonable suspicion'' refersto an observable, articulable basis in fact which indicates that a particularemployee was involved in, or responsible for, an economic loss. Thus, forexample, access in the sense of possible or potential opportunity, standingalone, does not constitute a basis for ``reasonable suspicion''. Informationfrom a co-worker, or an employee's behavior, demeanor, or conduct may befactors in the basis for reasonable suspicion. Likewise, inconsistenciesbetween facts, claims, or statements that surface during an investigationcan serve as a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion. While accessor opportunity, standing alone, does not constitute a basis for reasonablesuspicion, the totality of circumstances surrounding the access or opportunity(such as its unauthorized or unusual nature) may constitute a factor indetermining whether there is a reasonable suspicion. (2) For example, in an investigation of a theft of an expensive piece ofjewelry, an employee authorized to open the establishment's safe no earlierthan 9:00 a.m., in order to place the jewelry in a window display case,is observed opening the safe at 7:30 a.m. In such a situation, the openingof the safe by the employee one and one-half hours prior to the specifiedtime may serve as the basis for reasonable suspicion. On the other hand,in the example given, if the employer asked the employee to bring the pieceof jewelry to his or her office at 7:30, and the employee then opened thesafe and reported the jewelry missing, such access, standing alone, wouldnot constitute a basis for reasonable suspicion that the employee was involvedin the incident. (3) The employer has the burden of establishing that the specific individualor individuals to be tested are ``reasonably suspected'' of involvementin the specific economic loss or injury for the requirement in section7(d)(3) to be met. (g)(1) As discussed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, section 7(d)(4)of the Act sets forth what information, at a minimum, must be providedto an employee if the employer wishes to claim the exemption. (2) The statement required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section mustbe received by the employee at least 48 hours prior to the time of theexamination. This will provide the employee with adequate pre-test noticeof the specific incident or activity being investigated and afford theemployee sufficient time prior to the test to obtain and consult with legalcounsel or an employee representative. (3) The statement to be provided to the employee must set forth with particularitythe specific incident or activity being investigated and the basis fortesting particular employees. However, section 7(d)(4)(A) requires specificitybeyond the mere assertion of general statements regarding economic loss,employee access, and reasonable suspicion. For example, an employer's assertionthat an expensive watch was stolen, and that the employee had access tothe watch and is therefore a suspect, would not meet the ``with particularity''criterion. If the basis for an employer's requesting an employee (or employees)to take a polygraph test cannot be articulated, and reduced to writing,then the standard would not be met. The identity of a co-worker or otherindividual providing information used to establish reasonable suspicionneed not be revealed in the statement. (4) It is further required that the statement provided to the examineebe signed by a person authorized to legally bind the employer. The standardwould not be met if the person signing the statement is not authorizedto legally bind the employer, and accordingly the exemption would not applyin such a case. (h) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption are subjectto the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the Act, as discussedin andSection;andSection; 801.20, 801.22, 801.23, and 801.35 of this part.As provided in these sections, the exemption will apply only if certainrequirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified requirementsnullifies the statutory authority for polygraph test administration andmay subject the employer to the assessment of civil money penalties andother remedial actions, as provided for in section 6 of the Act (see SubpartE, andSection; 801.42 of this part). The administration of such tests isalso subject to State or local laws, or collective bargaining agreements,which may either prohibit lie detector tests, or contain more restrictiveprovisions with respect to polygraph testing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;801.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption for employers authorized to manufacture, distribute, ordispense controlled substances.   </ITAG>(a) Section 7(f) provides an exemption from the Act's general prohibitionregarding the use of polygraph tests for employers authorized to manufacture,distribute, or dispense a controlled substance listed in schedule I, II,III, or IV of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812).This exemption permits the administration of polygraph tests, subject tothe conditions set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the Act and andSection;andSection;801.21, 801.22, 801.23, and 801.35 of this part, to:     (1) A prospective employee who would have direct access to the manufacture,storage, distribution, or sale of any such controlled substance; or   (2) A current employee if the following conditions are met:    (i) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing investigationof criminal or other misconduct involving, or potentially involving, lossor injury to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any such controlledsubstance by such employer; and     (ii) The employee had access to the person or property that is the subjectof the investigation.    (b)(1) The terms ``manufacture'', ``distribute'', ``distribution'', ``dispense'',``storage'', and ``sale'', for the purposes of this exemption, are construedwithin the meaning of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 <T3>et seq.</T3>), as administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA), U.S. Department of Justice.    (2) The exemption in section 7(f) of the Act applies only to employerswho are authorized by DEA to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlledsubstance. Section 302 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 822)requires every person who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses any controlledsubstance to register with the Attorney General (i.e., with DEA). Commonor contract carriers and warehouses whose possession of the controlledsubstance is in the usual course of their business or employment are notrequired to register. Since this exemption is intended to apply only toemployees and prospective employees of persons or entities registered withDEA, and is not intended to apply to truck drivers employed by personsor entities who are not so registered, it has no application to employeesof common or contract carriers or public warehouses. Truck drivers andwarehouse employees of the persons or entities registered with DEA andauthorized to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances,are within the scope of the exemption where they have direct access oraccess to the controlled substances, as discussed below.    (c) In order for a polygraph examination to be performed, section 7(f)of the Act requires that a prospective employee have ``direct access''to the controlled substance(s) manufactured, dispensed, or distributedby the employer. Where a current employee is to be tested as a part ofan ongoing investigation, section 7(f) requires that the employee have``access'' to the person or property that is the subject of the investigation.   (1) A propective employee would have ``direct access'' if the positionbeing applied for has responsibilities which include contact with or whichaffect the disposition of a controlled substance, including participationin the process of obtaining, dispensing, or otherwise distributing a controlledsubstance. This includes contact or direct involvement in the manufacture,storage, testing, distribution, sale or dispensing of a controlled substanceand may include, for example, packaging, repackaging, ordering, licensing,shipping, receiving, taking inventory, providing security, prescribing,and handling of a controlled substance. A prospective employee would have``direct access'' if the described job duties would give such person accessto the products in question, whether such employee would be in physicalproximity to controlled substances or engaged in activity which would permitthe employee to divert such substances to his or her possession.    (2) A current employee would have ``access'' within the meaning of section7(f) if the employee had access to the specific person or property whichis the subject of the on-going investigation, as discussed in andSection;801.12(e) of this part. Thus, to test a current employee, the employeeneed not have had ``direct'' access to the controlled substance, but mayhave had only infrequent, random, or opportunistic access. Such accesswould be sufficient to test the employee if the employee could have caused,or could have aided or abetted in causing, the loss of the specific propertywhich is the subject of the investigation. In addition, a maintenance workerin a drug warehouse, whose job duties include the cleaning of areas wherethe controlled substances which are the subject of the investigation werepresent, but whose job duties do not include the handling of controlledsubstances, would be deemed to have ``access'', but normally not ``directaccess'', to the controlled substances. On the other hand, a drug warehousetruck loader, whose job duties include the handling of outgoing shipmentorders which contain controlled substances, would have ``direct access''to such controlled substances. A pharmacy department in a supermarket isanother common situtation which is useful in illustrating the distinctionbetween ``direct access'' and ``access''. Store personnel receiving pharmaceuticalorders, i.e., the pharmacist, pharmacy intern, and other such employeesworking in the pharmacy department, would ordinarily have ``direct access''to controlled substances. Other store personnel whose job duties and responsibilitiesdo not include the handling of controlled substances but who had occasionto enter the pharmacy department where the controlled substances whichare the subject of the investigation were stored, such as maintenance personnelor pharmacy cashiers, would have ``access''. Certain other store personnelwhose job duties do not permit or require entrance into the pharmacy departmentfor any reason, such as produce or meat clerks, checkout cashiers, or baggers,would not ordinarily have ``access'' of any type. In the case of ``directaccess'', the prospective employee's access to controlled substances wouldbe as a part of the manufacturing, dispensing or distribution process,while a current employee's ``access'' to the controlled substances whichare the subject of the investigation need only be opportunistic.    (d) The term ``prospective employee'', for the purposes of this section,includes a current employee who presently holds a position which does notentail direct access to controlled substances, and therefore is outsidethe scope of the exemption's provisions for preemployment polygraph testing,provided the employee has applied for and is being considered for transferor promotion to another position which entails such direct access. Forexample, an office secretary may apply for promotion to a position in thevault or cage areas of a drug warehouse, where controlled substances arekept. In such a situation, the current employee would be deemed a ``prospectiveemployee'' for the purposes of this exemption, and thus would be subjectto preemployment polygraph screening, at the time of such a change in position.However, any adverse action which is based in part on a polygraph testagainst a current employee who is treated as a ``prospective employee''may be taken only with respect to the prospective position and may notaffect the employee's employment in the current position.      (e) Section 7(f) of the Act makes no specific reference to a requirementthat employers provide current employees with a written statement priorto polygraph testing. Thus, employers to whom this exemption is availableare not required to furnish a written statement such as that specifiedin section 7(d) of the Act and andSection; 801.12(a)(4) of this part.(f) For the section 7(f) exemption to apply, the polygraph testing of currentemployees must be administered ``in connection with an ongoing investigationof criminal or other misconduct involving, or potentially involving, lossor injury to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any such controlledsubstance by such employer * * *''.(1) Current employees may only be administered polygraph tests in connectionwith an ongoing investigation, relating to a specific incident or activity,or potential incident or activity, as discussed in andSection; 801.12(b)of this part. Thus an employer is precluded from using the exemption inconnection with continuing investigations or on a random basis to determineif thefts are occurring.(2) In addition, the test must be administered in connection with lossor injury, or potential loss or injury, to the manufacture, distribution,or dispensing of a controlled substance.(i) Retail drugstores and wholesale drug warehouses typically carry inventoryof so-called health and beauty aids, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs,and a variety of other similar products, in addition to their product linesof controlled drugs. The noncontrolled products usually constitute themajority of such firms' sales volumes. An economic loss or injury relatedto such noncontrolled substances would not constitute a basis of applicabilityof the section 7(f) exemption. For example, an investigation into the theftof a gross of cosmetic products could not be a basis for polygraph testingunder section 7(f), but the theft of a container of valium could be.(ii) Polygraph testing, with respect to an ongoing investigation concerningproducts other than controlled substances might be initiated under section7(d) of the Act and andSection; 801.12 of this part. However, the exemptionin section 7(f) of the Act and this section is limited solely to lossesor injury associated with controlled substances.(g) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption are subjectto the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the Act, as discussedin andSection;andSection; 801.21, 801.22, 801.23, and 801.35 of this part.As provided in these sections, the exemption will apply only if certainrequirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified requirementsnullifies the statutory authority for polygraph test administration andmay subject the employer to the assessment of civil money penalties andother remedial actions, as provided for in section 6 of the Act (see SubpartE, andSection; 801.42 of this part). The administration of such tests isalso subject to State or local laws, or collective bargaining agreements,which may either prohibit lie detector tests, or contain more restrictiveprovisions with respect to polygraph testing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 801.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemption for employers providing security services.</ITAG>(a) Section 7(e) of the Act provides an exemption from the general prohibitionagainst polygraph tests for certain armored car, security alarm, and securityguard employers. Subject to the conditions set forth in sections 8 and10 of the Act and andSection;andSection; 801.21, 801.22, 801.23, and 801.35of this part, section 7(e) permits the use of polygraph tests on prospectiveemployees provided that such employers have as their primary business purposethe providing of armored car personnel, personnel engaged in the design,installation, and maintenance of security alarm systems, or other uniformedor plainclothes security personnel; and provided the prospective employeesare being hired to protect:(1) Facilities, materials, or operations having a significant impact onthe health or safety of any State or political subdivision thereof, orthe national security of the United States, such as_(i) Facilities engaged in the production, transmission, or distributionof electric or nuclear power,(ii) Public water supply facilities,(iii) Shipments or storage of radioactive or other toxic waste materials,and(iv) Public transportation; or(2) Currency, negotiable securities, precious commodities or instruments,or proprietary information.(b)(1) Section 7(e) permits the administration of polygraph tests onlyto prospective employees. However, security service employers may administerpolygraph tests to current employees in connection with an ongoing investigation,subject to the conditions of section 7(d) of the Act and andSection; 801.12of this part. (2) The term ``prospective employee'' generally refers to an individualwho is being considered for employment, for the first time, by an employer.However, the term ``prospective employee'' also includes current employeesunder circumstances similar to those discussed in paragraph (d) of andSection;801.13 of this part. Thus, for example, a security guard may be hired fora job outside the scope of the exemption's provisions for pre-employmentpolygraph testing, such as a position at a supermarket. If subsequentlythis guard is transferred or promoted to a job at a nuclear power plant,this currently-employed individual would be considered to be a ``prospectiveemployee'' for purposes of this exemption, at the time of such proposedtransfer or promotion. However, any adverse action which is based in parton a polygraph test against a current employee who is treated as a ``prospectiveemployee'' may be taken only with respect to the prospective position andmay not affect the employee's employment in the current position. (c) Section 7(e) applies to any private employer whose ``primary businesspurpose'' consists of providing armored car personnel, personnel engagedin the design, installation, and maintenance of security alarm systems,or other uniformed or plainclothes security personnel. Thus, the exemptionis limited to firms primarily in the business of<T3> providing</T3> such security services to others. (For example, a utilitycompany which employs its own security personnel could not qualify.) Inthe case of diversified firms, the term ``primary business purpose'' shallmean that at least 50% of the employer's annual dollar volume of businessis derived from the provision of the types of security services specificallyidentified in section 7(e). (d)(1) As used in section 7(e)(1)(A), the terms ``facilities, materials,or operations having a significant impact on the health or safety of anyState or political subdivision thereof, or the national security of theUnited States'' include protection of electric or nuclear power plants,public water supply facilities, radioactive or other toxic waste shipmentsor storage, and public transportation. These examples are intended to beillustrative, and not exhaustive. However, the types of ``facilities, materials,or operations'' within the scope of the exemption are not to be construedso broadly as to include low priority or minor security interests. The``facilities, materials, or operations'' in question only consist of thosehaving a ``significant impact'' on public health or safety, or nationalsecurity. However, the ``facilities, materials, or operations'' may beeither privately or publicly owned. (2) The specific ``facilities, materials, or operations'' contemplatedby this exemption would include those against which acts of sabotage, espionage,terrorism, or other hostile, destructive, or illegal acts could have aserious effect on the general public's safety or health, or national security.In addition to the specific examples set forth in the Act, the terms wouldinclude: (i) Facilities, materials, and operations owned or leased by Federal, State,or local governments, including instrumentalities or interstate agenciesthereof, for which an authorized public official has determined that aneed for security exists, utilizing private armored car, security alarmsystem, or uniformed or plainclothes security personnel, or a combinationthereof, such as: (A) Government office buildings; (B) Prisons and correction facilities; (C) Public schools; (D) Public libraries; (E) Water supply; (F) Military reservations, installations, posts, camps, arsenals, laboratories,and other similar facilities vital to defense and security; (ii) Commercial and industrial assets and operations which_ (A) Are designated in writing by an appropriate Federal agency to be vitalto national security interests (such as those of defense contractors andresearchers), including factories, plants, buildings, or structures usedfor researching, designing, testing, manufacturing, producing, processing,repairing, assembling, storing, or distributing products or componentsrelated to the national defense; or (B) Would pose a serious threat to public health or safety in the eventof a breach of security (such as a plant engaged in the manufacture orprocessing of hazardous materials or chemicals); (iii) Public and private energy and precious mineral facilities, supplies,and reserves, including_ (A) Public or private power plants and utilities; (B) Oil or gas refineries and storage facilities; (C) Strategic petroleum reserves; and (D) Major dams, such as those which provide hydroelectric power; or (iv) Major public or private transportation and communication facilitiesand operations, including_ (A) Airports; (B) Train terminals, depots, and switching and control facilities; (C) Major bridges and tunnels; (D) Communications centers, such as receiving and transmission centers,and control centers; and (E) Transmission and receiving operations for radio, television, and satellitesignals; or (v) The Federal Reserve System and stock and commodity exchanges;(vi) Hospitals and health research facilities; and (vii) Large public events, such as political conventions and major parades,concerts, and sporting events. (3) Whether given ``facilities, materials, or operations'' fall withinthe contemplated purview of this exemption will be determined by the Administratoron request prior to the administration of the polygraph test, based onall the facts and circumstances. It is not possible to exhaustively accountfor all ``facilities, materials, or operations'' which fall within thepurview of section 7(e)(1)(A). While it is likely that additional entitiesmay fall within the exemption's scope, any such ``facilities, materials,or operations'' must meet the ``significant impact'' test. Thus, ``facilities,materials, or operations'' which would be of vital importance during periodsof war or civil emergency, or whose sabotage would greatly affect the publichealth or safety, could fall within the scope of the term ``significantimpact''. (3) Section 7(e)(1)(B) of the Act extends the exemption to firms whosefunction includes protection of ``currency, negotiable securities, preciouscommodities or instruments, or proprietary information''. These terms collectivelyare construed to be assets handled by financial institutions such as banks,credit unions, savings and loan institutions, stock and commodity exchanges,brokers, or security dealers. These terms also refer to assets which aretypically handled by, protected for and transported between and among commercialand financial institutions. Services provided by the armored car industryare thus clearly within the scope of the exemption, as are security alarmand security guard services provided to financial institutions of the typereferred to above. However, security alarm or guard services provided toprivate homes, or to businesses not primarily engaged in handling, trading,transferring, or storing currency, negotiable securities, precious commoditiesor instruments, or proprietary information, are outside the scope of theexemption. This is true even though such places may physically house somesuch assets. (f) An employer who falls within the scope of the exemption is one ``whosefunction includes'' protection of ``facilities, materials, or operations'',discussed in paragraph (e) of this section or of ``currency, negotiablesecurities, precious commodities or instruments, or proprietary information''discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Thus, assuming that the employerhas met the ``primary business purpose'' test, as set forth in paragraph(d) of this section, the employer's operations then must simply ``include''protection of at least one of the facilities within the scope of the exemption.(g)(1) Section 7(e)(2) provides that the exemption shall not apply if apolygraph test is administered to a prospective employee who would notbe employed to protect the ``facilities, materials, operations, or assets''referred to in section 7(e)(1) of the Act, and discussed in paragraphs(e) and (f) of this section. Thus, while the exemption applies to employerswhose function ``includes'' protection of certain facilities, employerswould be permitted to administer polygraph tests only to prospective employeeswho are being hired to perform such functions. (2) The phrase ``employed to protect'' in section 7(e)(2) has referenceto a wide spectrum of prospective employees in the security industry, andincludes all employees whose job duties affect the security of any qualifying``facilities, materials, operations, or assets,'' either directly or indirectly.(3) In many cases, it will be readily apparent that certain positions withinsecurity companies would, by virtue of the individual's official job duties,entail ``protection''. For example, armored car drivers and guards, securityguards, and alarm system installers and maintenance personnel all wouldbe employed to protect in the most direct and literal sense of the term.(4) The scope of the exemption is not limited, however, to those securitypersonnel having direct, physical access to the facilities being protected.Various support personnel may also have ``access'' to the process of providingsecurity services due to the position's exposure to knowledge of securityplans and operations, employee schedules, delivery schedules, and othersuch activities. Where a position entails the opportunity to cause or participatein a breach of security, an employee to be hired for the position wouldalso be deemed to be ``employed to protect'' the facility within the exemption'sscope. (5) For example, in the armored car industry, the duties of personnel otherthan guards and drivers may include taking customer orders for currencyand commodity transfers, issuing security badges to guards, coordinatingroutes of travel and times for pick-up and delivery, issuing access codesto customers, route planning and other sensitive responsibilities. Similarly,in the security alarm industry, several types of employees would have accessto the process of providing security services, such as designers of securitysystems, system monitors, service technicians, and billing clerks (whomay review the system design drawings to ensure proper customer billing).In the security industry, generally, administrative employees may haveaccess to customer accounts, schedules, information relating to alarm systemfailures, and other security information, such as security employee absencesdue to illness that create ``holes'' in a security plan. Employees of thistype are a part of the overall security services provided by the employer.Such employees possess the ability to affect, on an opportunistic basis,the security of protected operations, by virtue of the knowledge gainedthrough their job duties. (6) On the other hand, there are certainly some types of employees in thesecurity industry who ``would not be employed to protect'' the functionswithin the purview of the exemption, and who would not have ``access''to the process of providing security services. For example, custodial andmaintenance employees typically would not have access, either directlyor indirectly, to the operations or clients of the employer. Any employeewhose ``access'' to secured areas or to sensitive information is occasional,or on a controlled basis, such as by escort, would also be outside thescope of the exemption. In cases where security service companies alsoprovide janitorial, food and beverage, or other services unrelated to security,the exemption would clearly not extend to any employee considered for employmentin such activity. (h) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption are subjectto the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the Act, as discussedin andSection;andSection; 801.21, 801.22, 801.23, and 801.35 of this part.As provided in these sections, the exemption will apply only if certainrequirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified requirementsnullifies the statutory authority for polygraph test administration andmay subject the employer to the assessment of civil money penalties andother remedial actions, as provided for in section 6 of the Act (see SubpartE, andSection; 801.42 of this part). The administration of such tests isalso subject to State or local laws, or collective bargaining agreements,which may either prohibit lie detectors test, or contain more restrictiveprovisions with respect to polygraph testing.<ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart C_Restrictions on Polygraph Usage Under Exemptions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 801.20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Adverse employment action under ongoing investigation exemption. </ITAG>(a) Section 8(a)(1) of the Act provides that the limited exemption in section7(d) of the Act and andSection; 801.12 of this part for ongoing investigationsshall not apply if an employer discharges, disciplines, denies employmentor promotion or otherwise discriminates in any manner against a currentemployee based upon the analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusalto take a polygraph test, without additional supporting evidence.
