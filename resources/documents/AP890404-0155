Officials said onedemonstrator and a policeman were injured and 30 people werearrested.

The Maracaibo protestersalso said bus drivers were not allowing the discount for studentsand were charging them full fare.   Demonstrations have been frequent since the government beganapplying in February the provisions of an economic package approvedby the International Monetary Fund.   Bus fares were increased, but the government earmarked $10million to subsidize the 50 percent discount for students.Transport companies said the reduced fares didn't cover theirexpenses.
