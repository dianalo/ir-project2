About 3 million voters are expected at the polls to elect 93deputies to parliament, as well as whether to keep President AliSaibou in office. Saibou faces no opposition.   In 1987, voters approved a national charter that served as thebasis for a constitution that was approved Sept. 24 in thislandlocked nation of about 7 million people in the Sahara north ofNigeria and south of Libya.   Under the new constitution, Niger's president serves aseven-year term.   The new document is the first since the previous constitutionwas suspended in 1974 by Gen. Seyni Kountche who took power in amilitary coup during a devastating drought. After Kountche's deathin 1987, Saibou, the former head of Niger's military, was electedleader by the ruling Supreme Military Council.   Saibou freed about 100 people imprisoned for coup plots againstKountche.   In 1988, Saibou announced the creation of a political party, theNational Movement for a Society of Development. It remains the soleparty and its leader becomes the only candidate for the presidency.   Saibou, 49, has pledged to put Niger on the path of foodself-sufficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
