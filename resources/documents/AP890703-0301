RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected threeappeals raising the issue of whether skyrocketing punitive-damageawards in personal injury lawsuits violate due-process rights.   The decisions came one week after the court suggested it would bewilling to decide such cases.   Without comment, the justices turned away the case of a $17.8million award won by ventriloquist Paul Winchell over thedestruction of all videotapes of his popular children's televisionshow of the 1960s.   The court refused to hear arguments by Metromedia Inc. that thebulk of the California jury award _ $14 million in punitive damages_ is unconstitutional.   The court also refused to hear an appeal by Goodyear Tire andamp;Rubber Co., which was ordered to pay $4 million in punitive damagesto a Minnesota service station attendant injured by an explodingtire.   And the justices refused to study the issue in an appeal by asalt mining company ordered to pay $10 million in punitive damagesto Kansas farmers whose crops were ruined.   In other business-related decisions, the high court:   _Allowed the government to enforce regulations barring sales atbelow market value in a way foreign companies and U.S. importersclaim improperly impedes international trade.   The court rejected a Canadian steel producer's appeal that wassupported by a U.S. export-import association and an internationalconsumers group.   _Agreed to re-examine how far states may go to prohibitadvertising by lawyers, in an appeal by an Illinois lawyer censuredfor saying on his professional letterhead he is a civil trialspecialist certified by a private organization.   _Ordered reargument of related cases from Arkansas and Florida onwhether a business that successfully challenges a state tax as anundue burden on interstate commerce is entitled to be refunded moneyit paid before the tax was invalidated.   _Told a federal appeals court to restudy a lawsuit accusingbillionaire hotel owner Harry Helmsley and his business partners offraud in connection with a New York City condominium conversion.   On punitive damages, the high court June 26 ruled that theawards, no matter how large, do not violate the Constitution's banon excessive fines. The court said 7-2 that the ban does not applyto civil lawsuits between private citizens or corporations.   But it left open the possibility that due-process guarantees _the Constitution's assurance of fair play _ may limit juries'discretion to award enormous sums in civil suits.   The court was being urged in the three cases to impose a broadstandard for judges and juries, particularly in states that have notimposed ceilings on damage awards, not to rule on theconstitutionality of such limits.   Business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumergroups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a rangeof lawsuits.   Opponents say the big-money awards are catastrophic for U.S.competitiveness and discourage development of potentially riskyproducts, particularly new forms of medical treatment. They also sayjuries penalize the wealthy in order to benefit victims.   Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are apowerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to publicsafety. They say large corporations may view smaller compensatoryawards as an acceptable cost of doing business.   The Winchell case stemmed from a 1965 contract calling for him toproduce and host the ``Winchell-Mahoney Time'' television show,which featured Winchell's dummy, Jerry Mahoney.   A dispute between Winchell and Metromedia arose in 1969 overfuture broadcast rights of tapes of 288 shows. Metromedia erased all288 tapes in 1972. When Winchell learned in 1976 that the tapes hadbeen destroyed, he sued Metromedia for breach of contract.   In the case of the exploding tire, Goodyear was ordered to pay$3.37 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitivedamages to Dale Hodder.   Hodder, who worked at a service station in Remer, Minn., was 17at the time of the accident on Dec. 19, 1981. The metal rim of atruck tire manufactured in 1955 exploded while he was mounting thetire on a customer's logging truck. Goodyear has since discontinuedmaking that type of tire, called a K-rim.   In the Kansas case, General Host Corp. and its subsidiary CudahyCo. were ordered to pay Rice County farmers $3.06 million for actualdamages from 1975 through 1983 plus the $10 million punitive award.   Salt mining operations run by the companies were found to havepolluted an underground stream, making the water unusable forirrigation.</TEXT></DOC>
