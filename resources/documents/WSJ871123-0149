The company said it was advised by investors led by Dean L. Sloane, Prime Medical's president and chief executive officer, that a preliminary commitment the group had received for financing its proposed $4-a-share buy-out had been withdrawn.    The bid, valued at $28 million, is for the 82% of the 8.4 million Prime Medical shares that the group doesn't own.    The company, which manages medical-care facilities, said the group indicated that it remains &quot;committed to pursuing a leveraged buy-out or other transaction that would result in the group acquiring the company in a transaction fair and equitable to all stockholders.&quot;    It said Mr. Sloane has said that the group intends to initiate talks with the independent committee of the board with a view toward structuring such a transaction.    Prime Medical shares closed at $2.375, down 37.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
