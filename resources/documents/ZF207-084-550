InDecember, a jury had awarded Gulab Tinmahan, a software consultant in Orinda,Calif., more than $2.5 million -- $1 million of which was punitive damages.andO;Tinmahan had sought $15 million.andM;The judge went on to say, ''Plaintiff failed to produce any evidence that thebank's actions were perpetrated in conscious disregard of plaintiff's rights.andO;At most, negligence only has been shown.andP;  .  .  and this in no way justifiesthe imposition of punitive damages.''andM;Tinmahan had worked as a consultant for the bank.andP;  In that capacity, hebrought to the bank software he had already developed and createdcustom-developed applications.andP;  The software was used to handle the bank'sinternational money transfers.andM;When Tinmahan's relationship with the bank fell apart, he sought the returnof the software he had developed.andP;  The bank, at first, refused to give it tohim.andP;  Then, after it assented, Tinmahan claimed the software was damaged, andsued.andM;Judge Shaw also granted Bank of America's motion for a new trial, ''on theground that the jury's finding is clearly contrary to the evidence.''andM;The bank's attorney, Frank Sommers IV, said he has filed an appeal for theactual damages, the portion of the decision that still remains.andM;''We're hopeful as to the appellate process in particular, because of thecourt's finding that Tinmahan wasn't telling the truth,'' said Sommers.andM;In overturning the punitive damages, Judge Shaw identified contradictions inTinmahan's testimony and said, ''Tinmahan's demands for the software wererendered even more confusing by his failure to specify .andP;  .  .  the programsin question.''andM;Tinmahan, however, isn't giving up.andP;  ''We've already filed a notice of appealon a number of different issues, including this judgement,'' said John Owen,one of Tinmahan's attorneys.andM;In its original decision in December, the jury awarded nothing for Tinmahan'sclaim of unjust enrichment -- that the bank was unjustly enriched by usinghis software.andP;  The court found that the bank had the right to use thesoftware developed by Tinmahan.andM;Tinmahan claims the problems with the trial, the award and now the judge'sruling to overturn the punitive damages are the result of Sommers trying toteach the jury about the technical aspects of software development.andM;''This case is not a computer case.andP;  It's a theft case,'' he said.andM;Furthermore, Tinmahan said he plans to sue the bank for copyright violationafter this suit is finished.andM;Tinmahan said software the bank is currently using for money transfers isbased on his software and therefore violates his copyright.andM;Tinmahan also sued the bank for slander, but that suit was settled out ofcourt last August.andP;  Now, Tinmahan claims, he wants to reopen the slander suitbecause, he says, Sommers has been talking about the suit.andP;  Under the termsof the settlement, both parties were barred from discussing it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
