The report was disclosed as U.S. trade negotiators steppedup their efforts to persuade four European governments togive up further financial support for the aerospace companiesthat make up the Airbus consortium. The U.S. has threatenedto file a formal complaint with the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade if the issue isn't resolved by Sept. 30.</LP><TEXT>   The report, prepared by Gellman Research Associates Inc.of Jenkintown, Pa., and adopted by the department, said thereis &quot;little likelihood&quot; of Airbus ever paying back anestimated $13.5 billion in loans and other subsidies from theFrench, German, British and Spanish governments. By the year2008, Airbus could have a cumulative negative cash flow of$30 billion in 1990 dollars, the report predicted.   &quot;None of Airbus' projects, past, present and indevelopment, appears to be commercially viable,&quot; the reportconcluded. The European governments claim that the consortiumcould become profitable as a result of the currently strongdemand for passenger airliners.   The report criticized the Airbus partnership asanti-competitive. The report said the three largest civilaircraft makers in Europe have removed themselves aspotential joint venture partners with companies from the U.S.and elsewhere unless the activity involves the entireconsortium.   Continued Airbus subsidies could cut sharply into theprofits of U.S. manufacturers, forcing them to either seekforeign capital or give up further chunks of the airlinermarket, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
