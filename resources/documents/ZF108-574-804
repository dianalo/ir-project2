 The demands stem from new corporate concerns.andP;  Companies aresearching for ways to improve productivity and cut operating costs, often bydownsizing.andM;MIS UNDER PRESSUREandM;As businesses try to do more with fewer workers, pressure mounts on corporateMIS departments.andP;  For many firms, downsizing means increased use of computertechnology.andM;These demands are dumped into the laps of data processing staffs, which inmany cases are already overburdened.andP;  So, MIS managers are asking vendors forsophisticated software programs to automate functions and help corporationskeep pace with changinge requirements.andM;&quot;MIS departments must react quickly to changing computer requirements,&quot;explained Jeffrey Bell, the program manager for A series software at UnisysCorp., Blue Bell, Pa.andP;  &quot;Many old techniques for measuring system performancecannot be quickly implemented, so users are asking for new tools.&quot;andM;MIS departments must also monitor complex issues.andP;  Network configurations areincreasing in complexity, applications are being developed faster andcomputer-literate users are demanding more from their systems.andM;As a result, MIS departments are overseeing more complex computercapabilities.andP;  &quot;In a common network, a technician may be responsible for5,000 system elements,&quot; said Suri Harish, product manager for distributedsystem manager products at Tandem Computer Corporation in Cupertino, Calif.andO;&quot;If a problem arises, he must quickly determine the problem's source.andP;  Toperform that task, he needs sophisticated software.&quot;andM;The new software is needed to cushion another phenomenon.andP;  As computer usageand complexity increase, MIS departments are being blindsided by downsizingissues.andP;  Corporate desires to do more with less extends to the data center.andO;Systems programmers, who are high-priced talent, are often a chief target ofbudget cuts.andM;Software programs are helping companies replace these employees.andP;  &quot;Companiesare trying to automate many system programming tasks,&quot; said Richard Roberts,product manager for central systems in the large systems area of Bull HNInformation Systems Inc. in Phoenix, Ariz.andM;Faced with these issues, MIS managers are taking a close look at computercosts, and many are startled by what they find.andP;  Hardware and software arenot the highest-priced components in a computer purchase; maintenance costsmore.andP;  If a corporation keeps a computer for five years, maintenance costsare twice as high as the purchase price.andM;AUTOMATION A PRIORITYandM;So, users are searching for ways to automate many maintenance functions, tocut costs and to evaluate system performance.andP;  One area of growing interestis performance monitoring, previously an overlooked issue.andM;&quot;Historically, we did not do much performance analysis,&quot; said Jeffrey Rice,VP of operations at Knight-Ridder Financial Information Group in Leighwood,Kan.andP;  &quot;Collecting performance information simply took too much time.andP;  Wewould take days or even weeks to gather the data.&quot;andM;Users are asking for other types of programs as well.andP;  MIS managers want toautomate manual data center tasks, such as backing up tapes, monitoring diskdrive usage and purging files.andP;  Users want tools that predict rather thanlist problems.andM;Suppliers are responding.andP;  They are now delivering tools to captureperformance information, outlining comprehensive architectures for thesetools and taking advantage of microcomputer technology to help users plan forfuture system requirements.andM;The availability of tools for these tasks varies from vendor to vendor.andP;  Fourhardware vendors ramping up their efforts in this area are: Bull, StratusComputer Inc. in Marlboro, Mass., TAndem and Unisys.andM;Of the four suppliers, Tandem has been the most aggressive in addressing thesystems software market.andP;  In 1987, the company outlined an architecture toallow software companies and users to design programs to manage computer andnetwork usage.andM;&quot;The system problems customers want to solve involve all aspects of computeruse,&quot; said Harish at Tandem.andP;  &quot;So, our arthitecture had to be broad enough toaddress central processors, subsystems and computer networks.&quot;andM;Gary Iosbaker, a senior system engineer at Applied Communications Inc., anOmaha, Neb., firm that specializes in automatd teller machine software, said,&quot;Tandem did an excellent job outlining an architecture that meets user andsoftware vendor requirements.&quot;andM;The architecture, Distributed Systems Management (DSM), is a set of servicesto manage standalone or connected Tandem computers running the company'sGuardian operating system.andM;Tandem's Guardian 90 Performance Analyzer (GPA) examines system performanceand recommends necessary configuration changes.andM;Information can be viewed in summary reports or broken down into detailedgroupings, such as the CPU load at 10:00 a.m.andP;  A performance scoreillustrates how well each system component operates.andM;The software automates many manual tasks.andP;  If problems are evident, thesoftware generates a peripheral utility program to redistribute resources.andO;If changes do not work, the software backs out the changes and returns thesystem to its original settings.andM;GPA works with Measure, Tandem software that collects performanceinformation.andP;  Measure coordinates measurement functions, works online andoffers technicians a number of ways to examine performance data.andM;Measure collects information from entities, which include processes, processcodes, virtual circuits, communications lines, logical files, transactions,CPUs, disk drives, remote systems and terminals.andM;The software collects a maximum of 64 concurrent measurements.andP;  With thiscapability, a technician can evaluate several subsystems simultaneously.andM;Tandem's Network Statistical System (NSS) monitors network performance.andO;Users can customize the types of statistics gathered.andP;  The softwarehighlights items approaching predefined performance thresholds, so anoperator can make changes before problems occur.andM;NSS features graphics display, online inquiries and report writingcapabilities.andP;  A technician can produce network usage reports with Enform,Tandem's report writing software.andM;SeeView is windowing software that enables a network operator to examinedifferent operations from a single terminal.andP;  The software features a scriptfacility so network operators can tailor screens to display informationpertinent to their needs.andP;  SeeView allows an operator to work with 30 windowsat once.andM;DSM/SNAView links Tandem network management systems to IBM mainframe systems,such as IBM's NetView and the System Center Inc.'s Net/Master.andP;  WithDSM/SNAView, event and alarm information can be sent to IBM mainframes.andP;  Thesoftware converts Tandem information into IBM Network Management VectorTransport data so it can be carried on a Systems Network Architecture (SNA)network.andP;  (SNA, IBM's data communications architecture, provides a standardoperating environment for IBM systems, with capabilities to gateway to otherproducts.)andM;DSM  Problem Manager is a problem-tracking system that stores information ina Tandem NonStop SQL database management system.andP;  DSM/PM automatically orsemiautomatically collects and classifies problem information.andM;The software opens problem records in three ways.andP;  First, the systemautomatically generates a record if an event exceeds designated performancecriteria.andP;  Second, a network operator monitoring the operation ofapplications can identify problems and electronically mark informationattached to a problem record.andP;  Third, a manual entry facility prompts editsand validates operator input.andM;Tandem seems to be ahead of its key competitor, Stratus Computer Inc., indelivering systems software.andP;  Applied Communications' Iosbaker said,&quot;Currently, Stratus' products are not as mature as Tandem's products.andP;  Tandemcomputers have been on the market longer; consequently more tool areavailable for Tandem.&quot;andM;In July, Stratus will begin shipping its first performance managementproduct, Performance Measurement and Reporting System (PMRS).andP;  This software,which run on Stratus fault-tolerant computers, consists of programs thatcapture, organize and present information about Stratus XA2000 computerperformance.andM;The software is able to balance loads across different processors, act as acapacity planning tool and help users identify system bottlenecks.andP;  Thesoftware uses information captured from meters, which are accumulators thattrack the arrival and completion of tasks by CPUs and disk drives.andP;  The usersets thresholds for the type of information that will be captured, accordingto Bill Davis, a product manager in Stratus' software tools area.andM;With PMRS, performance data is stored in a central database managementsystem.andP;  Reports can be generated on a screen or printed out by a plotter orprinter.andP;  Network operators can examine data in specific groupings, such asdata for a module, disk drive or workload.andP;  The product features an onlinehelp facility.andM;Bull has been a mainframe supplier for more than three decades.andP;  Bull'sRoberts said the primary way to capture performance information is with thecompany's Performance Analysis Reporting System 8 (Pars 8).andM;The software, which is included in the operating system, monitors, recordsand reports system resource usage.andP;  Performance data is stored on a disk in aproprietary database management system and can be displayed in bar graphs.andM;Hal Milazzo, a project leader at P.H.H.andP;  Relocation and Real EstateManagement Services, USA, Wilton, Conn., has been using Pars 8 for ahalf-dozen years and is satisfied with the information the software provides.andO;He did recommend one improvement for the product, however.andM;&quot;We would like to see a connection from a mainframe to a microcomputer,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;It is much easier to analyze data on a microcomputer than on amainframe.&quot;andM;At the end of 1989, Bull released software that embellishes the display ofperformance information.andP;  The company's Performance Utilization SystemMonitor software produces a variety of graphic displays and uses color toillustrate component usage.andM;Bull also resells capacity planning tool from Systar, a French company with aU.S.andP;  office in Greenbelt, Md.andP;  The Systar line consists of three modules:Alice, Boris and Olga.andP;  Automated Library for Communications and Expertise(Alice) collects system usage problem cases so system technicians can analyzethem.andM;The Business Oriented Reports on Information Systems (Boris) combines qualitycontrol and capacity planning tools.andP;  The product displays system usagetrends.andP;  A network manager can perform a daily check of system usage tomonitor quality, resource usage and system load.andP;  The software detectsproblems in system performance and illustrates them to a systems analyst.andO;Usage information can be displayed by day, month or year.andM;Olga, the Online Graphic System Analyzer collects information from operatingsystems, peripherals, time-sharing monitors, transaction processors,application programs and telecommunications lines.andP;  Users can displayinformation in realtime or replay mode.andP;  The software functions as anoperations monitoring tool, and helps technicians detect, investigate anddiagnose problems.andM;Bull sells other tools that automate data center operations.andP;  One programautomates file maintenance.andP;  The Comprehensive Archival System automaticallypurges files after certain periods of time.andM;Bull's Tape Management product maintains tape inventory records, tapemaintenance records and tape identification information, such as code type,track and density.andM;For users with more sophisticated requirements, Bull sells a tape managementsystem from TOSC Inc. in Houston.andP;  This system automatically moves historicfiles to less costly media, such as from disk to tape.andM;Another mainframe heavyweight, Unisys, also developed system managementsoftware programs for its computer  systems.andP;  The company, which resultedfrom the merger of Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp., is working to deliver acomprehensive set of tools that can be used on either brand of computer.andM;Unisys' Bell said that the tools developed for each brand of computer arebeing merged under a new family of software tools, dubbed the CapacityManagement Facility (CMF), for both the A series B series mainframes, and the2200.andM;The first product in the line, CMF.Snapshot is a microcomputer-based capacityplanning tool.andP;  The software offers a realtime system performance monitor andproduces a number of system utilization reports.andP;  Performance information canbe presented in color formats.andP;  And a calendar feature helps techniciansselect information for specific time periods.andM;The second tool, CMF.Disk, measures available disk space on Unisys series Bmainframes.andP;  The program helps users determine if their disk subsystems arecreating system bottlenecks.andP;  The software collects disk subsystemconfiguration and performance information by direct calls to an operatingsystem.andM;Unisys also offers CMF.Database for the 2200 only.andM;Delivery of new tools has been a welcomed relief to many users.andP;  &quot;Gatheringperformance information is much easier now that vendors are focusing on theirtools,&quot; said Rice at Knight-Ridder Financial Information Group.andM;Vendors have seen a growing number of users purchasing these products tomanage their systems.andP;  &quot;A few years ago, there was only a vague awarenessabout the capabilities of system management tools,&quot; said Iosbaker at AppliedCommunications Inc.andP;  &quot;Now, approximately 80% of our customers use these toolsand their level of sophistication is growing.&quot;andM;NOT A PANACEAandM;But the system management tools are not a panacea.andP;  The level of integrationbetween different tools is at best rudimentary.andP;  &quot;Customers want allperformance information stored in one place,&quot; said Tandem's Harish.andP;  &quot;Vendorshave to rewrite their subsystems to perform that task.andP;  Suppliers are movingin that direction but it takes time.&quot;andM;Also, the software adds significant overhead to computer systems.andP;  Vendorsdownplay or deny this, but capturing performance information in someinstances requires as much processing power as running large productionapplications.andM;Knight-Ridder's Rice reported that the company only runs monitoring toolsoccasionally because of their overhead.andM;Stratus, Tandem and Unisys have delivered programs that run onmicrocomputers.andP;  By offloading processing from a mainframe, vendors let usersgather performance information with little additional mainframe overhead.andM;Micros are easier to use than larger systems.andP;  &quot;Customers want to takeadvantage of microcomputer user interfaces,&quot; said Unisys' Bell.andM;Better tools are being delivered, but vendors still have plenty of work todo.andP;  Rice said, &quot;Current tools are much better than previous methods ofgathering information, but they still fall short of our requirements.&quot;andM;SYSTEM MANAGEMENT TOOLSandM;Made by TANDEM: Distributed Systems Management (DSM) Guardian 90 PerformanceAnalyzer Measure SeeView DSM/SNAView DSM Problem Manager Surveyer TandemCapacity Model (TCM) Network Statistics System (NSS)andM;Independently Supplied Tools: Enlighten, Software Professionals, SanFrancisco Xytimer, Xypro Technology Corp., Simi Valley, Calif.andM;SYSTEM MANAGEMENT TOOLSandM;Made by STRATUS: Performance Measurement and Reporting Systems (PMRS)andM;Independently Supplied Tools: Insite, Data Research and Applications, Inc.,andO;Knoxville, Tenn.andP;
