With the expansion, utility costs increased by $225,000 in thefirst year. In addition, further large increases in electricity and naturalgas rates were anticipated in coming years. Development of an energyreduction program therefore became of major importance. In 1982, DeaconessHospital investigated federal matching funds for energy conservationmeasures. The hospital applied for and received an energy grant awardof $408,000 for four projects, one of which involved replacing an old,hardwired building control system with a new, microprocessor-based buildingautomation system. Price was important in the selection process but therewere several other factors that outweighed price alone: an English-languageformat; system's ease of use; and local availability of experienced serviceand support for the system. This chapter discusses the performance ofthe building automation system, a digital switching system also installed,and future plans for fire and security systems.</TEXT></DOC>
