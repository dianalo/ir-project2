Skinner was chosen for the role during a meeting that he and Mrs.Dole had with President Bush in the Oval Office last Friday,according to administration officials.   These officials, discussing a somewhat sensitive issue on groundsthey not be identified publicly, said Bush wanted Skinner to takethe lead in defending administration policy to lawmakers on CapitolHill and in numerous interviews and news conferences.   National strikes can present presidents with public relationsproblems, for their decisions seldom are likely to please both laborand business. And the general public often has strong views as well,especially when inconvenienced as in the current strike that all butshut down Eastern.   The airline filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcycourt on Thursday.   In the strike by Eastern's Machinists union, Bush selected as hischief spokesman a man who had built a reputation for dealing withtough labor-management problems during his time as chairman of theRegional Transportation Authority in Northeastern Illinois, thenation's second largest transit authority.   But Skinner is a Washington newcomer, notwithstanding his brashstatement on arrival here that ``I'm not going to take a back seat.''   Mrs. Dole, in contrast, formerly was secretary of transportationduring the Reagan administration. And as head of the LaborDepartment now, she would have seemed to have been in a uniqueposition to be the out-front Cabinet member in dealing with theEastern strike.   ``He's been in the lead, but she's been along every step of theway,'' said one administration official. He said that Skinner was anatural choice for the front-line role because the strike involvesthe airline industry, which is regulated in part by the FederalAviation Administration, which is a part of the TransportationDepartment.   ``It was a conscious decision'' that Mrs. Dole take a secondaryrole, said her spokeswoman, Dale Tate. ``It was an issue that wasviewed much more as a transportation issue than a labor issue. As aformer secretary of transportation, Mrs. Dole understood that.''   Said Skinner spokesman Bob Marks: ``The major concern was airsafety, and the economic impact of the potential secondary boycottsby the unions _ an area that the Department of Transportation hasresponsibility for.''   Another theory is that Mrs. Dole was kept in the background toinsulate her from direct confrontation with the leaders of organizedlabor _ people with whom she has pledged to seek harmoniousrelations.''   However, an AFL-CIO official, declining to be identifiedpublicly, dismissed any notion that the Bush administration has beentrying very hard to protect Mrs. Dole's credibility with organizedlabor.   He said that while she had promised to seek improved relationswith unions, top labor leaders were not consulted before theadministration's decision to seek to raise the minimum wage from$3.35 to $4.25 an hour, and retain a $3.35-an-hour wage rate forinexperienced youths.   The choice of Skinner as the chief administration spokesman onthe Eastern strike is in keeping with the pattern that was setduring the strike by the Professional Air Traffic ControllersOrganization against the FAA in 1981.   But the two situations are not entirely alike. In the formercase, the government itself was being struck. And then-PresidentReagan, the controllers' ultimate boss, fired all of them. At thesame time, he put Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis out front ashis main spokesman. Then-Labor Secretary Ray Donovan was nearlyinvisible.   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., a senior member ofthe House Public Works Committee, said he found it ``very, verysurprising'' that Mrs. Dole had not entered the Eastern dispute.   ``It's surprising that given this is the first major labor issueto come before the new administration, and her former involvement assecretary of transportation, she hasn't been visible in any way,''he said in an interview.   But Mineta also said he believed it was typical of her actions astransportation secretary, which he described as ``pretty much anon-involvement process for her.''</TEXT><BYLINE>___</BYLINE><TEXT/><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE _ Merrill Hartson covered the labor beat for The</NOTE><TEXT>   Associated Press from 1981-84 and now covers the White House.</TEXT><TEXT/></DOC>
