The analytical testing concern said net income is expected to be in the range of three cents to five cents a share, or between $192,000 and $321,000, up from $159,000, or two cents a share, a year earlier. But results &quot;would more likely be at the lower end of the range,&quot; Claude L. Buller, president and chief executive officer, said. Mr. Buller said consolidated earnings are likely to be depressed by a loss from a new West Coast laboratory, which had start-up expenses.    Revenue for the quarter, ended June 28, is expected to rise between 40% and 45% from $4.3 million a year earlier.    Mr. Buller said Wall Street analysts' projections of full-year profit in the range of 15 cents to 20 cents a share aren't off the mark. In 1986, CompuChem had a loss of $602,000 on revenue of $15.2 million.    Mr. Buller said CompuChem has succeeded in diversifying away from dependency on governmental testing contracts. &quot;The majority of the businesses (65% of total revenue) is now commercial,&quot; he said in an interview.    Still, he added, the Environmental Protection Agency remains the company's largest single client for enviromental testing, and the Army remains its largest client for drug testing services.    Mr. Buller said the company's growing drug testing business accounted for about half of revenue in the quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
