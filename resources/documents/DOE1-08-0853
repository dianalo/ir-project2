In order to understand the carbon transportoccurring between various regions of these materials through liquid sodium,an accurate knowledge of the carbon activity-concentration relationshipin the austenitic steels is esssential. A new method involving equilibrationof the steel sample with liquid sodium coupled with the measurement ofcarbon activity in sodium, employing an electrochemical carbon meter,is reported for the measurement of the carbon potential of the steelat different carbon concentrations in the temperature range of 860-960K. The results obtained are discussed and a new expression is proposedrelating carbon activity with the composition of steel. The thermodynamicsof carbide equilibrium in the steel are studied by isolating and charactersingthe carbide phase. These data have been analysed using a regular solutionmodel for the carbide phase, M/sub 23/C/sub 6/ and based on this theobserved composition of M/sub 23/C/sub 6/ as well as the variation ofthe carbon potential of steel with temperature have been explained.</TEXT></DOC>
