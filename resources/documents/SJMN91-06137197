Since World War II, universities have been paidoverhead based on university's expenses, not on set fees or percentages, hesaid.;    Larry Horton, Stanford's associate vice president for publicaffairs, said the university would have to study the proposal further beforecommenting.;    The changes proposed by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) will be placed in the Federal Register for comment before they becomeofficial.;    Since 1980, OMB guidelines have provided the framework foroverhead charges, which are overseen by the Department of Health and HumanServices and the Office of Naval Research.;    The new rules are the latestattempt to rein in what universities charge the federal government foroverhead.;    &quot;The administration remains committed to funding a fair share ofthe costs of the research enterprise,&quot; OMB Director Richard Darman said in anews release. &quot;But this share must not include excessive administrativecosts.&quot;;    Last month, OMB proposed rules that would prevent universitiesfrom charging liquor, entertainment, lobbying and trustees' travel and food,among other items, to taxpayers as part of overhead.;    Stanford deniesovercharges;  Stanford included such bills in its overhead calculations, andfederal investigators have found similar practices at many other universities.Stanford, however, is the only university that, according to federal auditors,overcharged taxpayers $150 million to $180 million during the 1980s. Stanfordsays it is not guilty of the overcharges.;    Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,whose subcommittee has led the investigations into university overheadreimbursement, criticized OMB's proposal. &quot;It's both too late and too early,&quot;he said. &quot;It's too late because there has already been a decade of abuse andtoo early because we have not really defined the problem.&quot;;    If adopted, thenew rules will cost university administrations nationwide $70 million,according to the OMB. The savings will be redirected and enable the federalgovernment to pay for many more grants a year, the office said. Rosenzweigsaid OMB told him the rules could save $100 million a year. The OMB proposalwould not affect current grants.;    Limit at 26 percent;  The rules wouldlimit reimbursement of administrative costs to 26 percent of a university'soverhead rate.;    Stanford's administrative costs make up more than half, orabout 30 percent of the 55.5 percent total, according to Paul Biddle, the Navyofficial whose questions led federal investigators to scrutinize theuniversity.;    The rate that colleges charge the government foradministrative overhead varies greatly. Of 139 universities OMB surveyed, theaverage administrative cost was 27 percent. In the 1990 fiscal year,UC-Berkeley's administrative rate was 28.9 percent, Howard University's was45, Harvard Medical School's was 38.2, Columbia's 36, MIT's 20.3, JohnsHopkins' 22.3 and Caltech's 21.8.;    In addition to the administrative costcap, the OMB rules would ensure that overhead funds given to universities fordepreciation on equipment and buildings be put back into equipment andbuildings. At present, universities can use overhead money for whatever theywant.;    For example, Stanford's reduced overhead rate is 55.5 percent. Thatmeans that when a professor receives a research grant of $100,000, theuniversity receives an additional $55,500 for overhead costs. Use of thatmoney is not restricted.;    OMB also is establishing a task force made up ofrepresentatives from several federal agencies to continue studying overheadreimbursement.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JEFF GOTTLIEB, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910516  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  706  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 16, 199100137197,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
