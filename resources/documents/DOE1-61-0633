<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0633 </DOCNO><TEXT>The primary thrust of the Bureau of Mines remote sensing research programhas been in the area of ground control planning. Because of the safetyproblems, down-time, and costs involved with unanticipated hazardousground conditions, accounting for potential hazards in mine plans canadd considerably to the safety and productivity of underground coal mines.Potential causes of ground control problems include the intersectionsand/or local concentrations of fractures or fracture sets (faults, joints,etc.) and sandstone paleo-channels. In the Western United States, thesegeologic features can often be detected at the surface in a mining areaas lineaments (linear features) on satellite images and aerial photographs.The full hazard analysis involves the inclusion of data from field checkingboth on the surface and underground at the mine site and the corroborationof lineaments as real geologic features in the subsurface by other geologicaland geophysical data. By cross-comparison in the computer, these datamay also indicate the degree and type of hazard that can be associatedwith the lineaments. Computerized remote sensing analysis minimizes interpreterbias (or dependence on level of experience) and facilitates the lineamentanalysis, subsequent editing, and data comparison. 14 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
