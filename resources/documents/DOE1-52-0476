Since classical approaches tohydrocarbon rearrangements involve acid-promoted carbocation chemistry,the authors have explored the possibility that highly Lewis acidic, earlytransition-metal alkyls and hydrides could effect C-C bond-forming or-breaking processes for simple hydrocarbons. They report herein thata scandocene hydride complex catalyzes the reversible branching and cyclizationof 1,4-pentadienes. The key feature responsible for this unusual reactivityis reversible olefin insertion/{beta}-alkyl elimination.</TEXT></DOC>
