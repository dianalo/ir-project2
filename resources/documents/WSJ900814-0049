The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard Universityrecently released its annual report on the state of thenation's housing. Slumps in residential construction andeconomic difficulties caused by the savings and loan bailoutare seen as evidence of a weak housing market. But lowerprices are confined to certain local markets, the centersays, and persistent declines in home prices and rents areunlikely on a national scale.   This is good news for the many homeowners whose homeequity is their largest single asset. But the news isn't sogood for aspiring homeowners. Over half of baby boomers ownhomes. Fewer homes will be built over the next decade, andthey will be bigger and more expensive, as baby boomers tradeup.   Increasingly upscale housing stock means renters will findit as difficult as ever to become homeowners. People need twothings to buy a house: cash for the down payment and closingcosts, and income to pay the mortgage.   Some people have one but not the other. Among youngrenters ages 25 to 34, 40% have the income to qualify for amortgage, but only 19% have the accumulated wealth for a downpayment. Relatively few have both. Just 20% of white rentersand 4% of black renters have both the income and savingsneeded to buy a typical starter home with a 10% down payment.                                                                                                          Greater Expectations   On Babies' Longevity                                                                                                          LIFE EXPECTANCY in the U.S. rose to a record high in 1989.   Last year's newborn can expect to live an average of 75.2years, according to new estimates from Metropolitan Life.This is up from a 1988 government estimate of 74.9 years.   Life expectancy at birth rose for both males and females,although women still live nearly seven years longer than men,on average. Girls born in 1989 can expect to live 78.6 years,compared with 71.8 for boys.   And living through the perilous infant and young-adultyears pays off. Men who turned 55 last year can look forwardto another 22.3 years, to reach the ripe old age of 77.3.Women who turned 55 last year can expect 26.8 more years,living to the age of 81.8. Men and women who celebrated their75th birthday in 1989 have an average of 10.9 years to go,for an average life expectancy of 85.9 years.   Life expectancy for blacks continues to be lower than forwhites. Black males born in 1988 -- the latest governmentestimate -- can expect to live 65 years, seven years lessthan the life expectancy for white males. The gap is smallerfor black females. Their average life expectancy at birth is74 years, five years less than for white females.   Babies have come a long way since the turn of the century,when life expectancy for whites at birth was 48.2 years forboys and 51.1 years for girls. But getting older has alwayshad its rewards. In 1900, white men at 85 could alreadyexpect to live another 3.8 years. Nearly nine decades later,85-year-old white men can expect just another five years.                                                                                                          Vietnam Veterans Work   As Often as Non-Vets                                                                                                          VIETNAM VETERANS are as likely as other men their age tobe working, unless they are disabled.   A supplement to a Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyco-sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs found fivemillion of the nearly eight million male Vietnam-era vets arenow ages 35 to 44. Of them, 95% are in the labor force, thesame rate as for non-veterans in that age group.   For the 2.5 million Vietnamera vets aged 35 to 44 whoserved outside the Vietnam theater of operations, the rate iseven higher, 96%. For the 2.5 million men 35 to 44 who servedin Southeast Asia, 93% are in the labor force. The rate isthe same for vets who saw combat and those who didn't.   Work force rates are obviously lower for those withdisabilities. Only 68% of the 548,000 Vietnam vets withservice-connected disabilities are in the labor force,ranging from 84% for those with minor disabilities to 27% forthose with major disabilities.   But these numbers, based on a survey of the civilian,noninstitutional population, don't include institutionalizedveterans. Veterans Affairs people say the veteran populationin institutions is difficult to count, though probably smallenough that it doesn't affect the overall picture of theveteran work force.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          JOB DISPLACEMENT is down, according to a Bureau of LaborStatistics survey. About 4.3 million Americans who had beenwith their employer for three or more years lost their jobsbetween 1985 and 1990 because of plant closings, staffreductions and related reasons. This is down from 5.1 millionworkers with at least three years of tenure who weredisplaced during the recessionary years in the first half ofthe '80s. Two out of five displaced workers lostmanufacturing jobs in the late 1980s, and they were lesslikely to be re-employed than those displaced in otherindustries. . . . Four percent of Americans age 15 or olderneed help performing at least one everyday activity becauseof a health condition lasting three or more months. A newCensus Bureau study found that about 1% of adults need helpwith just one of these five activities: doing housework,fixing meals, managing money, getting around outside andpersonal care. One percent need help with two activities; 2%need help with three or more.</TEXT></DOC>
