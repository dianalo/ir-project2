Keating Jr.'s $5 million bail, leaving theindicted former American Continental Corp. chairman to begina second week in jail.   Chicago attorney Stephen C. Neal, who maintains the66-year-old Mr. Keating is deeply in debt and unable to raisesuch an amount, could appeal next to the state supreme court,although he declined to comment yesterday on what his nextlegal step.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Keating and three other officers of either Phoenix,Ariz.-based American Continental or its Lincoln Savings unitin California were charged by a state grand jury withdefrauding California purchasers of about $250 million ofuninsured American Continental bonds by making false claimsabout the safety of the securities. They surrendered earlylast week and are scheduled for a formal arraignment on Oct.5.   The co-defendents returned home last weekend aftersuccessfully petitioning for reductions from the $1 millionbail originally set for them. At the same time, however, thestate Judge Gary Klausner refused to reconsider Mr. Keating's$5 million bail, and said he believed the Arizona businessmanmight have reasons to flee from the criminal prosecution, andother legal and financial problems.   Mr. Neal criticized as &quot;wholely inappropriate and inept&quot;remarks on Friday by Los Angeles County District Attorney IraReiner, who said Mr. Keating's mug shot &quot;ought to be postedin every boardroom in the United States,&quot; and compared theKeating case to that of fugitive financier Robert Vesco.   Mr. Keating's attorneys maintained in their petition tothe appeals court that Mr. Keating is &quot;unlawfully imprisoned&quot;because he doesn't present a flight risk and has bail &quot;50times higher than bail set for other defendants faced withidentical charges.&quot; Mr. Neal had told Judge Klausner that Mr.Keating is interested only in defending himself against thecharges, but that he &quot;can't prepare a defense from L.A.County Jail. It is impossible.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
