Under the proposal, if a student files a complaint, the facultymember would appear before a committee, which would evaluateevidence and decide punishment.   ``The faculty have been the prime movers for this policy,'' LeonBennett, vice president for legal affairs, said Monday. ``We're nottrying to create a hostile environment, we're trying to preventone.''   Civil libertarians say such a policy might infringe on aperson's constitutional right of free association. Other criticsquestion whether a university can, or should, regulaterelationships between adults.   SMU, like most universities, prohibits faculty and staff frommaking sexual advances and seeking sexual favors in exchange forfavorable treatment.   Officials at SMU say they have received 10 sexual harassmentcomplaints in the last five years, Everett Winters, director ofSMU's Office of Affirmative Action, said. Although some professorshave been reprimanded, none have been dismissed, demoted or takento court.   Lindley Doran, director of the Human Resources Women's Center,said the harassment policy was proposed by the center and theuniversitiy's Commission on Status of Women. The Faculty Senateapproved it in the spring of 1987.   She said the proposal is now with the administration, which isinvestigating what legal sanctions can be used. The faculty Senatewould then review the proposal. With its approval, it will go tothe Trustees.   Ms. Doran said she thinks the proposal will be university policyby the end of the semester.</TEXT></DOC>
