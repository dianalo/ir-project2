Bush interrupted a three-day holiday weekend at Camp David tofly here by helicopter for a self-congratulatory address before2,200 of the party faithful at the biennial convention of theNational Federation of Republican Women.   Bush boasted that the Republican party ``understands theheartbeat of the American people'' and is ``the only party thatdelivers on its promises.''   He made no reference to Panama and last Tuesday's abortive coupthere. Critics have accused Bush of failing to act decisively toaid rebel officers seeking to overthrow strongman Manuel AntonioNoriega.   Bush, his right hand bandaged from minor surgery three days ago,instead crowed about successes on several fronts, from arms controlwith the Soviets to curbing pollution and rebuilding America'sschools.   He praised the 140,000-member federation for mounting acandidate recruiting program called Project '90.   ``Part of governing is making sure that in the Executive Branchthe best are chosen to serve. So we've sought out the best _ andour record of appointing talented and qualified women to importantoffices proves it,'' the president told the women at a luncheon inthe Baltimore Convention Center.   ``We've appointed 139 women to senior positions in thisadministration. ...'' said Bush. ``That's more women appointed inour first nine months than any previous administration managed inany given year.''   ``I frankly believe that's a great step toward goodgovernment,'' said Bush, who said the 139 included:   _88 women nominated or announced for senior positions requiringSenate confirmation;   _21 to presidential appointments not requiring confirmation;   _30 to deputy assistant secretary posts in Cabinet departments,also not requiring confirmation.   White House personnel director Chase Untermeyer said last monththat 20 percent of the posts requiring Senate confirmation havegone to women. The old record for appointing women to postsrequiring Senate confirmation was 72, set by President Jimmy Carterin 1980.   The GOP women were winding up their 25th biennial convention.   Bush, who also addressed their last convention in 1987, said,``We promised America peace and prosperity and we're keeping thatpromise.''   He cited his recent call at the United Nations for a ban on allchemical weapons, as well as his proposal to drastically reduceconventional forces in Europe and what he called ``steadymovement'' toward long-range nuclear arms treaty with the Soviets.   The economy has just entered ``the 83rd month of uninterruptedeconomic growth,'' and nearly half a million black Americans havefound jobs in the past two years, Bush said.   Bush said his administration has also made headway on theenvironment, in staging the recent education summit and in thestruggle against drugs.   The crowd gave some of its biggest cheers to First Lady BarbaraBush, whom the presidential affectionately introduced as ``thesilver fox.''   The couple flew immediately back to Camp David from Fort McHenryafter the 15-minute speech.   The Bushes were spending the Columbus Day holiday at thepresidential retreat before returning to the White House Mondayafternoon.   On Thursday Bush will be out on the hustings in Mississippi andNew York City, trying to help Republicans retain the congressionalseat of the late Rep. Larkin Smith, R-Miss., and wrest themayoralty of New York from the Democrats.</TEXT></DOC>
