The PC13 cells became responsive to the antiviraleffects of interferon after differentiation. Similarly, 2-5A dependentRNase was undetectable in undifferentiated murine neuroblastoma cells(N1E 115); however, the enzyme was also absent after differentiationto cells resembling neurons. NIE 115 cells are growth inhibited by interferondespite their deficiency in 2-5A dependent RNase. In contrast, interferonfailed to induce an antiviral state in N1E 115 cells regardless of thestate of cell differentiation. During differentiation the N1E 115 cellslost the ability to induce the interferon-regulated and double-strandedRNA dependent protein kinase and 2-5A synthetase levels decreased. Theseresults support the theory that the 2-5A system is an important pathwayin the antiviral mechanism of interferon action.</TEXT></DOC>
