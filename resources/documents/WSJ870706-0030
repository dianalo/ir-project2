The commission didn't identify any of the individuals or companies under investigation. It said it took the unusual step of admitting an investigation was underway because of &quot;extensive speculation in the financial markets&quot; about the existence of a probe.    &quot;No conclusion has been reached as to whether any illegal activities have occurred or whether any specific individual has been involved,&quot; the commission said.    Besides insider trading, the commission said it is investigating &quot;front running&quot; and other allegations of improper trading activities. Front running occurs when a securities trader knows that an institution is about to make a large stock purchase and buys a small number of shares ahead of the institution. The institutional purchase usually drives up the price of the stock, and the trader makes a small profit selling the shares to the institution.    The commission said its probe is at an early stage and that it won't comment further until the investigation has been completed. It said it has asked certain investment dealers for trading information about a number of their clients. </TEXT></DOC>
