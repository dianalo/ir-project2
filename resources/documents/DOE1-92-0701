The manometric effect due to the liquid sealformation in the loop seal and the difference of the liquid holdup betweenthe steam generator (SG) upflow-side and downflow-side caused a depressionof the core collapsed liquid level. The core liquid level was recoveredjust after the loop seal was cleared. The bypass between the core sideand the downcomer side affects the core liquid depression. Four 5% coldleg break experiments with the different core bypass location, configurationand size were conducted to clarify the bypass effect. When the bypasswas relatively small (less than 3% bypass of the initial core flow beforethe break), the timing of the loop seal clearing delayed with the bypass.When the bypass was relatively large (9.2% of the core flow), the loopseal clearing took place after the break uncovery and the timing wassignificantly delayed. In general, the smaller minimum core collapsedliquid level was obtained at the earlier timing of loop seal clearingdue to the smaller bypass.</TEXT></DOC>
