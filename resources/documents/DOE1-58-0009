The author believes that the CPUC andthe Energy Commission are going to encourage, to the extent possibleunder the law, competition among entities that are trying to sell capacityand energy to the utilities. This competition will result in the developmentof more individual sales arrangements and lower profit margins. In theinterim, QF (Qualifying Facility) developers must endure protracted CEChearing, obstructionist utilities, and a somewhat skeptical CPUC, allof which increase the cost of bring a project on-line.</TEXT></DOC>
