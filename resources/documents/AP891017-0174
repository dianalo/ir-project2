Observers speculated that Bulgarian authorities made the move tocreate a positive impression at a 35-nation conference on theEuropean environment that opened Monday in Sofia.   The diplomats, speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity,said activists from the unsanctioned Eco-Glasnost group have workedfreely since Saturday in Sofia, Bulgaria's capital. They said atleast 1,400 signatures had been collected on petitions against theproject.   Eco-Glasnost has been refused permission to register as anofficial organization. It was formed after several hundredactivists got together last year to protest pollution in the DanubeRiver city of Ruse and to campaign for cleaner air in Sofia.   Addressing the conference Tuesday, British chief delegateAnthony Williams said, ``Eco-Glasnost has not been allowed toregister and ... some of its members have suffered harassment.''   ``We urge the Bulgarian government to avoid ... harassment andto allow (Eco-Glasnost) and other similar groups to carry out theiractivities,'' a British diplomat in Sofia, reached by telephone,quoted Williams as saying.   The current petition campaign is directed against constructionof a hydrolectric plant in the Rila Mountains, about 75 milessouthwest of Sofia. The area is home to a 13th century monasteryfamous for its painted icons.   The government project was allowed despite official pledges inthe 1970s to keep the mountains a natural park and preserve.   The Bulgarian environmental activists plan to present theirpetitions to parliament and start legal action against the project,a Bulgarian emigre said on condition of anonymity.   The conference, the first of its kind, was being attended by the35 signatories to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act: the United States,Canada, the Soviet Union and European nations.   Among topics on the agenda are preventive measures againstindustrial accidents in border areas and pollution of internationalwaterways.</TEXT></DOC>
