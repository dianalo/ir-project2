Tehran has asked the court to rule that ``the United States isresponsible to pay compensation to the Islamic Republic to theamount to be determined by the court ... for the injuries sufferedby the Islamic Republic and the bereaved families,'' the officialquoted Iran's submission to the court.   Iran filed its application at the court on Wednesday, said theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with courtpractice.   It was not clear whether the Bush administration was planning totake part in the proceedings. The U.S. Embassy in the Haguedeclined comment.   The case involves the downing of an Iranian Airbus jet by theUSS Vincennes on July 3, 1988. All 290 passengers and crew of theplane died in the incident, which occurred after the Airbus waserroneously identified as an Iranian fighter plane by theVincennes' crew.   President Reagan said at the time that the families of thevictims would be compensated as an ``expression of grief'' but thatno other reparations would be made. The former administration saidthe unspecified compensation would go to families and not thegovernment of Iran.   But recently, Bush administration officials said they cannotcompensate the families until their receive more information fromIran about the victims.   The World Court, officially known as the International Court ofJustice, is the judicial branch of the United Nations. It has noenforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to itsrulings.   In documents filed at the court's registry, Iran also asked thecourt to quash a March 17 decision by the International CivilAviation Organization, which deplored the incident but did notblame the U.S. government, the court official told The AssociatedPress.   The court is considering when to begin proceedings in the case,which pits the United States against Iran in the World Court forthe second time since 1979.   In that year, the Carter Administration filed suit against Iranover the fate of 55 American diplomats held hostage at the U.S.Embassy in Tehran. The court ruled in favor of the U.S. government,ordering Iran to immediately release the hostages.   The Iranian government ignored the court ruling but later freedthe hostages in January 1980 after an elaborate deal was reachedwith Washington.   The United States withdrew from proceedings in the other majorWorld Court case in which it was involved earlier in the decade. In1984, Nicaragua sought a halt to U.S. support for the Contra rebelsand the court sided with the leftist Sandinista government twoyears later.   Only days before that complaint was filed, the Reaganadministration canceled its acceptance of World Court jurisdictionin Central American affairs.   Of the more than 150 U.N. member nations, only 49 have acceptedthe court's authority as compulsory in settling conflicts betweenstates. The United States is one of them, with the exception ofCentral American disputes.</TEXT></DOC>
