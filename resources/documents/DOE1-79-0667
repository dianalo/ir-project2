The unevenness in propulsion characteristic, caused bythe different excitation systems was reduced. A two-phase, eight-poletype linear pulse motor (LPM) was devised. This motor is superior inreduction of the irregularity in propulsion caused by the different excitationsystems and also has a stable control function. It is possible to movea pole at a nearly constant velocity with a constant propulsion maintained.Accordingly, running of the mover is smooth, which serves to reduce thevibration and the noise. For the purpose of carrying out rectangularwave or micro-step movement with the two-phase, eight-pole type LPM,the propulsion characteristics to the change in tooth dimension wereanalyzed by high-frequency. By calculating the gap permeance, for therespective driving, the optimum ratios of the pole pitch to the facewidth of the stator and the face width of the mover were determined.Stable micro-step movement is realized with high precision positioning.(9 figs, 1 tab, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
