Under proposed legislation drafted by the State Council,the effective tax rate on profits earned by all foreignventures operating outside special tax-concession areas wouldbe 33%. The proposed rate is unchanged from the current ratelevied on equity joint ventures but is lower than the ratespaid by many wholly foreign-owned concerns and contractualjoint ventures, which now have their earnings taxed at asmuch as 50%.</LP><TEXT>   Although new tax benefits appear limited, the billcontains many provisions aimed at addressing some of theinequities and incongruities in the tax structure. It alsoclarifies the tax status of earnings derived abroad byforeign businesses in China, as well as gains on land sales.   &quot;The bill represents a step forward in China's efforts tomake the tax structure more equitable, rational andsophisticated,&quot; said Albert Ng, a China tax expert withinternational accounting firm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.   Beijing hasn't announced its tax plan, but copies of theproposed legislation were made available to a small number oflaw and accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen. The billmay undergo revisions before the next session of the NationalPeople's Congress, China's rubber-stamp Parliament, which isexpected to convene in March.   Mr. Ng said Chinese tax officials are still debatingwhether the proposal should take effect this July 1 or nextJan. 1, the start of the next fiscal year. These officialsalso are considering whether to allow existing foreignventures to pay their taxes at current rates if the newsystem would result in their paying more.   The bill proposes no changes in tax regulations forforeign businesses that don't have an office in China.   Overall, the bill aims to provide a unified tax regime forforeign ventures in China. Since the country opened its doorsto overseas investors in the late 1970s, many provinces andcities have come up with their own preferential tax programsto attract foreign businesses, particularly from Taiwan andHong Kong. But with the implementation of the bill, thesevaried programs would be invalidated.   Under the proposed plan, contractual joint ventures andwholly foreign-owned enterprises would obtain the same taxtreatment as equity joint ventures. That means thesebusinesses would be subject to a flat 30% central-governmenttax plus a local tax of no more than 3%.   Currently, contractual joint ventures and whollyforeign-owned businesses are subject to a sliding tax-ratescale ranging from 20% to 40%, with local tax rates allowedto go as high as 10%. Unlike equity joint ventures,contractual joint ventures divide profits according to aformula that may not reflect the respective capitalinvestments of the partners.   Foreign tax experts said this change probably wouldstrengthen the growing trend among foreign investors tooperate alone in China. A shortage of domestic capital hasmade the search for Chinese partners difficult. This,combined with a perception that Chinese partners often onlycomplicate business dealings in the country, has promptedmany foreign concerns to establish wholly owned projects inrecent years. &quot;The bill would help facilitate the decision tooperate wholly foreign-owned concerns,&quot; said Mr. Ng of ArthurAndersen.   However, the tax proposal wouldn't affect enterprises inspecial investment areas. The current concessional tax ratesof 15% in special economic zones and designated developmentareas and 24% in many coastal cities won't change.   One part of the proposal likely to cheer foreignbusinessmen is the elimination of the 10% tax now imposed onprofits remitted outside China by foreign partners in equityjoint ventures. Still, the impact of the change will belimited: Many export-oriented and high-technology venturesalready are exempted from the remittance tax, as are foreignpartners in other forms of ventures.   Another provision likely to be welcomed would allowforeign ventures to carry losses forward on their books for10 years. Under current rules, losses may be carried forwardfor only five years.   For some, the new legislation could bring higher taxes. InGuangdong province, for example, many representative officesand foreign businesses in lower tax brackets already pay aneffective rate of less than 28%, compared with the flat 30%rate in the proposal.   Another group that could be adversely affected is made upof Hong Kong businesses that trade through agents in China.Under current rules, these businesses don't pay any tax onprofits; only their agents' commission income is taxed. Thenew legislation, however, proposes taxing profits on sales bythese buyers and suppliers unless exemption is granted bybilateral tax treaty. Of China's major trading partners, onlyHong Kong lacks such a treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
