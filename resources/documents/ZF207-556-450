(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>To get past a problem, sometimes all it takes is a change of perspective.andO;With project-management software, there are several ways to look at projecttasks, including PERT charts, Gantt charts and work-breakdown structure (WBS)charts.andM;Many project-management packages offer an outline view that lets users entertasks with the overall project goal on top and smaller goals indentedbeneath.andP;  Some products, however, also display this hierarchy graphically ina WBS chart.andM;This review looks at three project-management packages that provide WBS-chartfeatures: Computer Associates International Inc.'s SuperProject Expert,Software Publishing Corp.'s Harvard Project Manager and Symantec Corp.'s TimeLine.andM;A WBS chart looks much like a corporate organizational chart, graphicallydepicting a project goal at the top and subordinate projects listedunderneath.andM;When making changes to a project, managers can save time by using the WBSchart instead of having to return to the project outline.andM;In testing these products, the major question was how well could they showand manipulate data in the the WBS-chart format.andM;To answer that, a series of 25 tasks was entered in a mock project.andP;  Aproduct's usefulness was determined by the variety of options available fordisplaying data within the work-breakdown structure.andM;Each product reviewed here had limits to the amount of information that couldbe displayed on a WBS chart.andP;  Tasks could be further modified by moving thetask boxes around the chart.andM;In all three products, it was possible to view the work-breakdown structureas either a graph or an outline, with each task and subtask indented atdifferent levels.andM;Each product was successful at manipulating individual tasks inside a chart.andO;The key difference was the amount of information that could be shown in thechart.andM;Time Line offered the most versatility in displaying the details of a task.andM;In contrast, SuperProject Expert and Harvard Project Manager could display arelatively limited amount of data per task on a chart.andM;In both cases, detailed project data could be stored in the program, but notshown on the chart.andM;Corporate buyers should recognize that these products may not meet all oftheir project-management needs.andM;For large projects spanning many years and thousands of individual tasks,they may want the additional power and flexibility of a mainframe- orminicomputer-based package.andP;  However, for more limited project-managementneeds, any of these packages will fit the bill nicely.andM;These packages were tested on a 286-based, 8MHz AT-compatible system fromDell Computer Corp. with a standard Video Graphics Array display adapter.andM;----------Expert Is Easy To LearnandM;COMPUTER ASSOCIATES INTERNATIONAL INC., SUPERPROJECT EXPERT 1.1, $695andM;Entering tasks in SuperProject Expert is quick and easy because the user hasto enter only the task name, duration and the resource to perform that task.andO;The package is less complex, but consequently less flexible, than the otherscovered in this review.andM;Although SuperProject Expert defaults to the PERT-chart mode when it is run,data can be entered in other views, including Gantt and WBS.andM;Once in the WBS chart, a handy feature allows the user to change the way achart appears -- it can be squeezed or condensed, or moved to the left orright.andP;  Hit one key and the task boxes can appear stacked on one another.andO;However, users cannot change the amount of content or detail in the taskboxes.andM;Like Harvard Project Manager, moving task data within a WBS chart is easy.andO;It is also possible to rearrange tasks from the WBS outline view becausechanges made to the outline are immediately reflected within the WBS chart.andM;Although it offers features similar to those of the other project-managementproducts, SuperProject Expert also adds the ability to import data fromComputer Associate's spreadsheet package, SuperCalc 5.andM;Users of SuperCalc 5 may want to look closely at this product if they have aneed for advanced spreadsheet analysis.andP;  (PC Week did not test this functionin this review.)andM;Along with good documentation, SuperProject Expert comes with a very useful&quot;answer card&quot; that lists all of the symbols used in the different types ofcharts.andP;  This helped flatten the learning curve.andM;Computer Associates International Inc., of San Jose, Calif., can be reachedat (800) 531-5236.andM;Buyers say: Difficult for large projectsandM;Most buyers reported that SuperProject Expert was easy to learn, but warnedthat moving tasks within large project models was at times tricky.andM;&quot;We are using [SuperProject Expert] for one large project covering about 250to 300 tasks.andP;  [It] cannot handle looking at it as one large project.andP;  Wehave to break it into smaller pieces of 25 to 30 tasks per subproject,&quot; saidJohn Melchiori, manager of business-systems support at North AmericanReinsurance Corp. in New York.andM;If a user wants a global view of the WBS chart for a project with more than50 tasks, then &quot;the text can shrink so much [that the view] is useless,&quot; hesaid.andM;However, SuperProject Expert's example-filled manual and tutorial make iteasy to learn, Melchiori added.andP;  &quot;We have 10 project leaders who picked it upin no time.&quot; he said.andM;Rearranging the WBS chart is generally easy, but moving smaller projects tolower levels of a main project is more difficult, according to KarenKosakowski, product test operation manager at McData Corp., a manufacturer ofdata-communications equipment in Bloomfield, Colo.andM;&quot;You have to re-enter the subproject and delete the old one.andP;  If you have adetailed subproject, [the process] can be time-consuming,&quot; she said.andM;&quot;It's reasonably easy to learn and easy to use,&quot; said Gordon Smith, seniorproduct manager at Novell Inc., in Provo, Utah.andM;There are different levels of operation ranging from novice to expert, headded.andM;When printing a report, &quot;unless you are careful about the control default onthe report generator, you get more information than you need,&quot; Smithexplained.andP;  &quot;You have to be careful in how you select your options.&quot;andM;For Judi Osterberg, software-support specialist at Phillips Medical SystemsNorth America Inc., a manufacturer of X-ray and digital equipment in Shelton,Conn., creating the WBS chart with SuperProject Expert was easy.andM;&quot;I input information and brainstorm in the outline view, and the programautomatically creates the WBS chart,&quot; she said.andM;Osterberg uses the WBS chart to display a project's tasks, which can rangefrom 10 to 10,000, in a structured format for meetings and presentations.andM;&quot;It's a good tool to use to explain what's going on,&quot; she said.andM;The package's hot keys allow the user to move from a WBS view to an outlineview by entering the first two letters of the chart the user wants to view,she said.andM;Osterberg said she appreciates SuperProject Expert's interface to dBASE filesand text files, allowing files to be imported from a mainframe.andP;  Themainframe connection is important because most company data resides on amainframe.andM;She said the package provides good capabilities for the price and waswell-suited to her company's needs.andM;Fast Track Speeds Data EntryandM;SOFTWARE PUBLISHING CORP.,andM;HARVARD PROJECT MANAGER 3.0, $695andM;This product's versatile implementation of the WBS chart offers projectmanagers an easy method for data entry, called &quot;fast track,&quot; which speeds theprocess of project creation by prompting the user only for the name andduration of the task.andM;Project managers can also create projects in other views, such as PERT, Ganttor WBS outline.andP;  Additional details about a task can be entered after theproject skeleton is complete.andM;Once the data is stored, it is easy to switch to other views of the sameinformation.andM;Moving tasks and milestones within the WBS is simple.andP;  The ordination andsubordination of one task to another remain consistent throughout the othergraphical views of the project.andM;Harvard Project Manager's documentation comes with a handy workbook that willbe very helpful for first-time users.andM;Software Publishing Corp., of Mountain View, Calif., can be reached at (415)962-8910.andM;Buyers say: Good graphicsandM;&quot;[Harvard Project Manager] is a great program from the WBS point of view,&quot;said Ray Wenig, president of International Managing Services Inc., atechnical consulting firm in Franklin, Mass.andP;  It is better than Time Line orSuperProject Expert for working with WBS structures, he claimed.andM;&quot;[The package] uses a light background on-screen, which makes the WBSstructure stand out.andP;  It uses line graphics as opposed to character mode,&quot;said Wenig.andM;Drawing network views is easy, Wenig said, but he hoped the product wouldhave a larger database for monitoring projects, enabling him to add moredetails to a task, such as dates, resources and split resources.andM;For projects with more than 100 tasks, recalculation is slow.andP;  &quot;When you tryto add a new task, it becomes slow compared to Time Line and SuperProjectExpert,&quot; he  said.andM;Harvard Project Manager is easy to use and &quot;saves you time and eliminates thedrudge work,&quot; said Bill Shelton, lead systems analyst for the city ofWinston-Salem, N.C.andM;With similar products, Shelton had to manually readjust the estimatedcompletion date as tasks got behind schedule.andP;  Harvard Project Managerperforms this computation automatically, he explained.andM;Another plus is the program's ability to create individual calendars for eachresource.andP;  This provides a realistic estimated completion date on a project,he  said.andM;&quot;The resource-leveling feature helps you easily identify conflicts within theproject,&quot; claimed Shelton.andP;  &quot;A lot of times you may not be aware there is aconflict until it actually occurs.&quot;andM;However, the package does not link separate projects for both resourceleveling and identifying resource conflicts between projects, he claimed.andM;Most Useful WBS-Chart FunctionsandM;SYMANTEC CORP., TIME LINE 3.0, $595andM;This flexible package lets users alter the structure of a WBS outline fromwithin the WBS chart.andM;As opposed to the sparse data-entry format of Harvard Project Manager, TimeLine presents a data-entry form that prompts the user for many projectvariables, such as resources and duration of the task.andM;Although the user has a choice of entering all of the task informationimmediately, only the name of the task and its duration are required atfirst.andM;One nice touch is the program's ability to use the most recent task's fieldvalue as a default for the current field.andP;  For instance, if one task laststwo days, the next task uses two days as the default duration.andP;  This provedto be a time-saver during data entry.andM;Time Line's WBS chart, which Symantec calls the &quot;tree view,&quot; can displayproject data in informative ways.andM;For instance, with two keystrokes the user can see the task name pluspercentage achieved, or only the start and finish dates.andP;  Of the threeproducts reviewed, Time Line offers the most useful WBS-chart implementation.andM;The documentation is quite thorough, including definitions ofproject-management terms, case studies and recommendations for more effectiveuses of the product.andM;Time Line was the only product reviewed here that came with a keyboardtemplate to ease the learning process.andM;Symantec Corp., of Novato, Calif., can be reached at (408) 253-9600.andM;Buyers say: Fast and easy to useandM;&quot;Time Line can import and export WBS numbers and task names, and take datainto Lotus 1-2-3 and use its graphical capabilities,&quot; reported Bill Woloch,project manager at Sverdrup Corp., an engineering, architectural andmanagement firm in Falls Church, Va.andM;Time Line allows &quot;about 20 characters in the WBS block.andP;  That's more thanI've ever needed to set up a schedule,&quot; said Woloch.andM;However, the maximum of 34 characters per task should be increased, and usersshould be able to schedule more activities, he said.andM;The product is fast and easy to use.andP;  &quot;It takes about 15 seconds, dependingon the size of your project, to recalculate your schedule,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Onsome of the other programs, including the expensive ones, I'd go get a cup ofcoffee, it took [so] long.&quot;andM;Woloch also said he liked the package's capabilities in updating taskinformation by using macros, and the product's ability to create customreports.andM;Scott Bittler, senior system project engineer at the Wilmington, N.C., plantof Corning Inc., an optical-fiber manufacturing firm, wants more control overplotting capabilities.andM;&quot;Currently, the plot comes out in one predefined size.andP;  We'd like to be ableto compress the whole plot so that larger schedules can be displayed on asmaller piece of paper,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I'd also like to see greater flexibilityover the selection of columns of information, such as start date andduration.&quot;andM;Bittler said that although Time Line consumes 3.2M bytes of disk space whenit is installed, &quot;one of the advantages of installing the program on anetwork is that you only store it on the disk that your server is on, freeingdisk space on remote computers.&quot;andM;----------Reviews by Dale Lewallen; interviews by Lori J.Dang; edited by JeffreyFrentzenandM;PC-based project-management software packages vary in price to a degree fargreater than many other types of applications.andP;  Although the packagesreviewed here fall into the $595 to $695 range, the spectrum ofproject-management products extends from $49.95 to $5,000.andM;According to industry experts, the price of a product is largely determinedby its feature set and its ability to handle projects of different sizes.andM;For the most part, the less expensive products are useful only for schedulingtasks and identifying the critical path of a project.andP;  More sophisticatedtechniques remain the domain of the high-end packages.andM;High-priced project-management products have advanced features, such asmultiple calendars that account for individual schedules (holidays, time off,different work hours and so on) of the personnel and the material resourcesinvolved in a project.andP;  They also offer several ways to allocate resourcesand defer tasks until resources are available.andM;Mainframe-based project-management products can use 20 or 30 algorithms todetermine the optimal mix of resources and tasks for a project.andP;  The productsreviewed here do not offer that level of detail.andM;-- Dale LewallenandM;As the controversy over what constitutes project management continues,arguments range from calling it a black art to praising it as an importantscientific tool.andP;  Whatever the case, a knowledge of the vocabulary oftenhelps to clarify the various  sides.andM;Critical Path: by definition, those tasks that will delay the completion of aproject as a whole if they do not stay on schedule.andM;Gantt Chart: a time-scaled bar chart useful in contrasting planned vs.andO;actual progress on a project; in addition, a Gantt Chart is a helpful way toview task relationships over time.andM;PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Technique) Chart: a way to show thedependency relationships among the tasks that make up a project, and one ofthe most popular methods of visualizing a project;
