Atleast 11 people were reported injured.   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon issued orders to use troops andmilitary equipment to keep vital industries like power plants anddefense factories running if they are threatened by strikes.   The government, which says a growing wave of strikes threatensstability, ordered a crackdown last week. President Roh Tae-woosaid strikes had cost $2.4 billion in lost production and $600million in reduced exports this year.   Riot troopers firing tear gas seized the electronics andmachinery factories Tuesday in Puchon on the western outskirts ofSeoul, police said. They said some workers hurled firebombs androcks but reported no serious injuries.   Government officials say militant labor unions and dissidentsare trying to incite a general strike on May 1, an internationallabor holiday. Union leaders deny the charge.   News reports said about 27,000 students took part in protestsTuesday at 44 campuses across the country.   About 10,000 students shouting ``Down with dictatorship!'' and``Yankee go home!'' mounted peaceful street marches outside twoSeoul campuses on the eve of the anniversary of a 1960 studentuprising. The students demand the ouster of Roh.   Violent campus riots broke out in the provincial cities ofChonju, Taejon, Suwon and Pusan when police used tear gas to blockstudents from marching, according to Yonhap, the South Korean newsagency.   In Pusan, 11 people were injured in clashes between about 2,000demonstrators and riot police outside Pusan National TeachersCollege, Yonhap said.   Riot police stormed the Seoul office of a government lawmakerTuesday and overpowered eight students who had attacked withfirebombs and occupied it.   No overall injury or arrest total was available.   Police also raided offices of labor activists and dissidents inthree cities near Seoul on Tuesday, seizing about 10,000 laborleaflets. At least 10 activists were arrested on charges ofinciting strikes.   Labor Minister Chang Yuyng-chul urged workers and management tosettle wage disputes peacefully, but he said the government wouldintervene to stop violent strikes or any other illegal activity.   Two of the country's three automakers, Daewoo and Kia, saidTuesday they had resumed partial production after strikes closedthem down the day before. But Hyundai, the nation's biggest carproducer, said it had not resumed work because of work stoppagesand a shortage of spare parts.</TEXT></DOC>
