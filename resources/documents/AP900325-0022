(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A legless, armless woman who woncustody of her daughter 14 years ago by changing the baby's diaperwith her teeth now plays ``We Shall Overcome'' and ``Over TheRainbow'' on this city's Boardwalk by pressing her tongue against akeyboard.   However, her music strikes the wrong chord with municipalprosecutor Steve Smoger, who said Celestine Tate is a ``conartist'' taking advantage of a special permit given her by the cityby not living up to an agreement to pay a fine in exchange forbeing allowed to perform.   Ms. Tate, a 34-year-old mother of two who lives in Ventnor, saidduring a break from a recent performance in front of Bally's ParkPlace Casino Hotel that she just wants to play her music.   ``It's a nice way to occupy my time rather than just sittingaround doing nothing,'' Ms. Tate said in a singsong voice.   She frequently asks God to bless passers-by who drop quartersand dollar bills into the bucket in front of her hospital gurney.   Smoger estimates Ms. Tate earns from $120,000 to $140,000 ayear. Ms. Tate puts the figure at more like $70,000 to $80,000.   She said her two daughters _ ages 11 and 14 _ attend privateschool in Philadelphia, and that she has to pay her $750-a-monthrent plus the expenses of a woman who comes in to help her at aweekly cost of $158.   In 1976, Ms. Tate had to prove to a Philadelphia judge that shecould care for the first of those girls after the welfaredepartment said she lacked the ability to raise the child.   ``I changed her diaper in court and the judge gave her back tome,'' Ms. Tate said, adding the child's paternal grandmother forcedher to break up with the girl's father because she was disabled.``It was the Lord's will that I give birth to her so it must be hiswill that I have her.''   Ms. Tate was born in Philadelphia suffering from birth defectsthat left her legs and arms undeveloped. During the interview, shehad to ask her cousin to pull a blue blanket over her when the windblew off the Atlantic Ocean onto the Boardwalk.   ``God gave me ways to use my mouth that people with handscan't,'' she said. ``I wouldn't trade me with anybody.''   Ms. Tate reaches the Boardwalk spot with the help of a cousin,who pushes her gurney two miles from Ventnor. She said she likes topass the Boardwalk's rolling chairs en route.   ``I'll be saying, `Beep, beep,' when I pass them,'' said Ms.Tate, who laughs and smiles easily, raising her eyes from herkeyboard to see whomever she is talking with.   She learned her craft in Philadelphia at a music school for thedisabled and came five years ago to Atlantic City, a touristdestination she remembered as a child and wanted to return to as anadult.   Tourists and residents alike seem to gravitate toward her,filling her bucket as if it it were a wishing well with requestsguaranteed.   ``I think it's beautiful,'' said Millie Vixson after she floateda $1 bill into the bucket. ``I admire the idea.''   Ms. Tate, who is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds,has had to battle repeatedly to preserve a spot on the Boardwalkand make a living, and her battles may not be over.   In March 1989, the city gave Ms. Tate a special permit thatexempted her from the city's 80-year-old ordinance barringBoardwalk panhandling. As part of the agreement, Municipal JudgeBruce Weekes said she had to pay a $2,600 fine over the next yearfor 26 violations. That followed a similar agreement reached inNovember 1986 between her and city officials.   Smoger said she has reneged on her latest agreement. Ms. Tatefreely acknowleges she hasn't paid the fines, arguing that sincethat she's not a beggar she shouldn't have to pay them.   She said she is not worried about possible further legal actionagainst her.   ``You're going to lock me up and feed me in jail or I'm going toeat on my own,'' Ms. Tate said.   Smoger said he sympathizes with Ms. Tate's disability but growstired of sparring with her over her failure to pay the outstandingfines.   ``She has done a remarkable job and should be commended forelevating herself to the position she has,'' Smoger said. ``She's acon artist. Every benefit that could be bestowed on to her has beenbestowed by the city of Atlantic City.''   He said he will seek revocation of her license if she does notpay the full $2,600 when her license comes up for its yearlyrenewal in June.   Smoger defended the anti-begging ordinance as necessary toprevent the Boardwalk from being swamped with people asking formoney. Ms. Tate said she's an entertainer, not a beggar or a publicnuisance.   ``I could not be begging with my mouth full,'' she said.   Her latest court battle involves something different than herfreedom to make a living. She is scheduled for a hearing in EggHarbor Township municipal court Friday on marijuana possessioncharges. Ms. Tate said she is innocent.   Howard Mitchell, Ms. Tate's cousin and the most recent relativeto push her gurney down the Boardwalk and watch over her, said hehas faith in the woman he calls ``Teeny.''   ``I get up and run away from life when I get scared,'' Mitchellsaid. ``She keeps my spirit very high. Sometimes I'll just say`Teeny, thank you.'''</TEXT></DOC>
