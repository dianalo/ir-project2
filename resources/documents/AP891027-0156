TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday thatreports of Israeli nuclear cooperation with South Africa weredesigned to ``tear the fabric'' of Israel's relations with theUnited States.   Analysts and media reports viewed the leaks as a form ofpressure on Shamir to accept U.S. peace proposals before he visitsWashington in mid-November.   They also said the reports could affect talks on economic andmilitary aid for Israel, which totaled $3 billion this year, andblock Israeli requests for supercomputers that could be used todevelop ballistic missiles.   NBC News reported that Israel provided South Africa with missiletechnology in exchange for a steady supply of uranium and use of aSouth African missile test range. Israel has denied it.   In an interview Friday with Israel's Arabic TV program, Shamirsaid he believed ``the aim was to tear the fabric of Israeli-U.S.relations, but I don't think it will harm them.''   He said Israel was trying to bridge differences with Secretaryof State James A. Baker III about plans for Palestinian-Israelitalks.   Yossi Ahimier, the prime minister's spokesman, said the aim ofreports about ties to South Africa was to whip up ``anti-Israelipublic opinion.''   ``Someone is trying to depict Israel as an enemy of peace or anegative factor in the region,'' he told The Associated Press.   Housing Minister David Levy of Shamir's right-wing Likud blocsaid such pressure contradicted U.S. assurances that Washingtonwould not ``turn its back or impose on Israel something that isagainst the government's interest.''   ``Should Israel raise its hands and give over its policy on sucha sensitive issue concerning its existence?'' he said on armyradio. ``On no account should it.''   Dore Gold, a specialist in U.S.-Israeli relations at Tel AvivUniversity's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said the reportsresulted from increased tensions between Israel and the UnitedStates.   ``Usually, at a time of tension, past U.S. administrations havetried to lower Israel's moral credibility in Washington,'' he said.   In addition to disagreements over the Baker plan, Gold said,Israel is at odds with the Bush Administration over the sale of M-1tanks to Saudi Arabia.   Questioning the veracity of the NBC report, Gold said a jointproject was ``not very sensible'' because Israel did not need anintercontinental ballistic missile and the main threats to SouthAfrica were from countries with 1950s and 1960s arms technology.   Harry Wall, director for Israel of the Anti-Defamation League ofB'nai B'rith, said the result was more likely to be a rallying ofIsraelis around Shamir than support for U.S. peace proposals.   ``I think it is more than coincidental that this report wasaired at such a sensitive time,'' he said. ``If this was a leakintended to soften Israel, I doubt that it will work. The lastthing this government needs to break the impasse is additional U.S.pressure.''   A Defense Ministry statement issued Friday denied as ``lackingall truth'' another NBC report that Israel transferred technologyfrom the U.S.-financed Lavi fighter plane project to South Africaafter the program was canceled.   It said Israel had not transferred U.S. technology or systemswith U.S. components to South Africa or any other country.   Phil Herman, a spokesman for Israel Aircraft Industries, whichmade the Lavi prototypes, said he did not know whether Lavitechnicians went to work in South Africa.   He declined comment on technology transfers, except to say``there are certain avionics that are on the open market forapproved customers.''   Israeli officials denounced as ``lies'' the NBC report thatIsrael was helping South Africa develop a long-range missile thatwas test-fired last summer.   They said Israel had adopted a policy in 1987 not to sign newdefense agreements with South Africa, in response to acongressional dewcision to suspend aid to any nation selling armsto that country.</TEXT></DOC>
