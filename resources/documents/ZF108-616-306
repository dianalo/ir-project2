(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Graphing experienceandM;Few people could have predicted when PCs first began to penetrate the officeenvironment that one of their greatest visible effects would be on thepresentation of information.andP;  Today, every office is rapidly becoming its ownpublishing house and a badly laid out report can usually be taken as a signthat the compiler has failed to come to terms with the new technology.andM;This concentration on the quality of presentation, however, doesn't end withwords.andP;  Increasingly, offices are also becoming their own designer's studio,and they're expected to be capable of taking the facts and figures which arepart of the raw material of business and turning them into the kind ofpolished charts and presentations which would have required expensiveprofessional work in the recent past.andM;The engine of this change has partly been the increasing capability ofsoftware, such as spreadsheets and even databases, to produce competentgraphic material on the basis of stored information.andP;  More important,however, has been the development of a new breed of software - the businessgraphics program.andP;  Drawing on the expertise of the increasingly sophisticatedgraphics market, business graphics programs are aimed at the need ofcompanies to put figures into visual form and to produce material which ismore than just plain figures.andM;The market leader in the field has been Software Publishing's HarvardGraphics.andP;  The version 2.3 upgrade is reviewed here for the first time.andP;  But,as in any developing market, other contenders are pressing their claims.andM;Prominent among the competition are Ashton-Tate, with Applause II andMicrografx, a specialist in graphics programming in a Windows environment,with Graph Plus.andP;  All three packages set out to offer as broad a range ofcapabilities as is possible, without sacrificing the prerequisite that suchprograms should be capable of producing first-class output in the hands ofthe relatively inexperienced.andM;Chart formsandM;All three review packages allow users to create a wide range of differentforms of business graph with relatively little preparation, although theapproach to the creation of a chart varies widely.andM;At first sight, the options offered by Applause seem limited.andP;  Three barformats are listed - single, stacked and ranked in 3D.andP;  However, bar chartscan be presented in either horizontal or vertical orientation, producing sixformats.andP;  A limited number of other options affect the appearance of a graph.andO;Less options are available in the case of pie chart formats - charts can be'exploded' to highlight certain sections or viewed in their entirety.andP;  Linecharts include four main options: single line, area, hilo and scatter graphs,plus options to stack series on top of one another or to overlap them.andP;  3Deffects are available in all formats, with control over the depth anddirection of the 'projection' of the items.andM;The latest version of Harvard Graphics provides a slightly more extensiverange of options for the creation of charts and combines them with twoseparate user interfaces.andP;  For relative newcomers there's a simple graphicalinterface which allows a choice to be made from a pictorial gallery of thedifferent chart types.andM;For more detailed control, you can set up chart characteristics in tabularform which, although initially forbidding, rapidly come to seem more flexibleand convenient than the other programs reviewed.andM;Where Applause, for instance, provides a range of options covered by separatedialogue boxes, all Harvard Graphics' major options relating to a particularchart are presented in a series of densely populated option screens which,although a little daunting at first, place all the major controlsconveniently to hand rather than separating them over a collection of menusand dialogue boxes.andM;Graph Plus adopts a different approach, presenting the major options for thetype of chart in the form of a text menu.andP;  Selecting one of the optionsbrings up a list of the major variants for that chart type.andP;  This could beconfusing if it wasn't for the fact that the variants are presentedgraphically, allowing users to have a good idea of the effect of any choicebefore it's made.andP;  As well as the options presented graphically there's awide range of detailed control over such items as shading and 3D projection,controlled by many menu options and dialogue boxes which might be forbiddingto less experienced users.andM;Multiple chartsandM;One area of comparison is the ability to place charts of different types ontothe same framework, or even to include more than one X or Y axis, allowing aline graph to co-exist with a bar chart, for instance.andP;  Here, HarvardGraphics suffers a little in comparison with Applause since, although it candisplay no less than six reduced charts on the same screen and even allowsthe manual positioning of one chart over another, it doesn't make it quite soeasy to automatically place different types of chart on the same framework.andM;Similarly, with Graph Plus, each chart is a separate graphical entity andseveral charts can be displayed or overlaid at will, but the process ismanual.andP;  The advantage of Applause is that, given a number of separate setsof data, each can have a completely different chart style applied to it andyet all can be displayed on a single framework.andM;Word chartsandM;All three graphics packages make competent provision for word charts.andO;Harvard Graphics limits users to one typeface for the whole chart - althoughsize and attributes can be varied for each item and other typefaces can beadded after the chart has been created using the Draw functions.andM;Applause allows greater flexibility, with individual control over the fontand attributes of any single text element.andP;  Graph Plus provides greatflexibility, applying all Window's font-handling capabilities to any part ofthe text, down to a single letter, but at the cost of greater effort on thepart of users and without the provision of any fonts over and above thosewhich users may already have installed.andM;Harvard Graphics and Applause both provide a range of templates for commonshapes of word chart, to which users can easily add material.andP;  HarvardGraphics even offers a spell checker, which can be applied to all the chartforms.andP;  Applause and Harvard Graphics also provide simple facilities for thecreation of organization charts.andM;DrawingandM;One of the strengths of modern business graphics packages is that theyrecognize that the formats provided may need to be customized or augmented.andO;All three packages allow user-created material to be added to a chart bymeans of standard drawing and text tools.andM;The draw facilities in Applause include text, lines, circles, wedges, arcs,rectangles and free-form lines.andP;  Once inserted, shapes can be subjected to avariety of manipulations including pushing to the back of a group, rotation,stretching, mirroring and automatic alignment.andP;  Free-form shapes consist oflines connecting a series of points and are easily edited since the pointscan be moved and new ones added at will.andP;  For major surgery, charts can besaved in the form of drawings and, once translated, each element becomesavailable for editing - a facility available in all three packages in oneform or another.andM;In upgrading its drawing facilities, Harvard Graphics took the curious routeof providing an extra program by the name of Draw Partner.andP;  Thankfully,although Draw Partner is still a separate entity, it has now been moreclosely integrated into the main program and can be called up with a specialkey combination.andM;The facilities built into the main Harvard Graphics program itself arecompetent but limited, although stronger than the others on the creation ofboxes in different styles.andP;  Draw Partner provides a greater range offacilities but has noticeable disadvantages - it has a very fussy userinterface which requires considerable effort to achieve results which wouldbe next to instant on most other draw programs.andM;Operations are heavily text-menu based and often require several choices toachieve the simplest result, such as sizing or stretching.andP;  For example, thedrawing of an ellipse would require the following process: 1) specify that ashape is being added to the design, 2) select the circle function, 3) press afunction key bringing up the circle options, 4) press another key to bring upthe choice between circle and ellipse, 5) select the ellipse option, 6) pressEscape to return to the main drawing screen ready to create the ellipseitself.andP;  Compare that process with the single click on an ellipse icon whichis all that most competent draw programs would require.andM;The Draw Partner program, of course, has some good features such as the sweepfunction which allows the placing of an array of shapes along a line.andO;Circular text can be created without difficulty and the program will evenperform a limited form of 'in-betweening', providing intermediate shapesbetween an original object and a copy which has been moved, rotated orresized.andM;For all its strengths, however, it's unfortunate that Draw Partner stillisn't fully integrated into the main program and that there are still minorincompatibilities between what Draw Partner can create and what the mainprogram can subsequently edit.andM;By far the most impressive of the three packages in the area of drawing isGraph Plus, which provides what is, in effect, a stripped down version of theMicrografx Designer program.andP;  The list of drawing commands and the facilitiesfor curve creation are impressive.andP;  Individual commands include arc, curve,ellipse, freehand line, parabola, polyline, rectangle, rounded rectangle andtext, each with full control over line colour, line width, line style, endstyle, plus fill colour and fill pattern for enclosed shapes.andM;Once drawn, most elements can be subjected to all the manipulations expectedof a full drawing program, such as flipping, mirroring, stretching androtation - even to the extent of creating circular arrays of objects.andP;  Inthis respect, Graph Plus scores by making effective use of the facilitiesprovided by an existing graphics operating system, leaving its authors freeto pursue the provision of a wider range of functions, relieved of the burdenof detailed programming of every aspect of their implementation.andM;AdornmentsandM;Detailed work in constructing new shapes or amending the elements of anexisting chart isn't the only way that its presentation can be enhanced.andP;  Theuse of both colour and predesigned shapes can transform an undistinguishedchart into something much more eye-catching.andM;The three packages make provision for adjusting the colour of elements incharts, but Graph Plus provides more detailed control than its rivals.andO;Rather than simply being able to set overall colours to a limited range, thecolour of any selected object can be adjusted using a palette with scrollbars.andM;New colours can be mixed from the primaries, with control over hue, lightnessand saturation.andP;  Custom palettes containing up to 192 custom colours can becreated and saved for later use.andM;An adequate range of fill patterns is built into the program but patterns canbe imported from the more extensive library of symbols.andP;  For convenience,there's little to beat Harvard Graphic's provision for 16 user-definedpalettes to be held in memory at any one time, allowing them to be shuttledthrough at the press of a function key.andM;All the programs come with clip-art collections of a high quality, containinga great deal of useful material, with hundreds of new symbols being added toHarvard Graphics' latest upgrade.andP;  Using the collections it's possible to addcommon business symbols and other devices to a chart to liven up thepresentation.andP;  Micrografx offers a further general collection of clip-artmaterial to users on registration, together with an extensive range ofreasonably priced, specialist clip-art collections.andP;  Graph Plus is alsoprobably the easiest of the three when it comes to pasting in items fromclip-art files, since it makes use of Window's cut and paste facilities.andM;For sheer outrageousness, however, neither of its rivals can hold a candle tothe collection of 78 backgrounds supplied with Applause II, from tropicalislands to moody sunsets.andP;  These designs, which can also be created using thedraw functions, are brought in 'behind' the current chart to transform itsappearance.andP;  Harvard Graphics and Graph Plus can create material which couldbe inserted 'behind' a chart, but the provision of a wide range of instantlyavailable high-quality screens with Applause must be a major attraction formany potential purchasers.andM;OutputandM;Once charts have been created and adorned in various ways the question ofoutput must be faced.andP;  Increasingly, material is being prepared on-screen foruse on-screen, in the form of 'slide' presentations.andP;  Each of the threepackages makes provision for this with built-in or separate utilities whichallow a list of charts to be displayed with varying delays and with thetransition from one chart to another on the screen accomplished in a varietyof ways.andP;  There's little to choose between the facilities on offer in thisrespect, with two exceptions.andM;First, the latest version of Harvard Graphics includes a neat provision for'buttons' which allow users to define an area or screen (or several) which,when selected, calls up another chart.andP;  Using buttons, it's now quitepossible to make a slide show interactive, with viewers following their ownroutes through the slides to material of specific interest.andM;The second difference to be noted when it comes to slide shows is the factthat both Applause and Graph Plus, with their greater range of graphicsimport formats, allow a wider range of material from other sources to beincluded in a presentation.andM;With printed copy, it would be rather surprising if packages costing justunder 400 pounds didn't produce material of an adequate standard.andP;  In fact,given the price, there are some disappointments.andM;In terms of fonts, Harvard graphics is best on non-PostScript printers,providing a list of seven different typefaces (plus bold, italic and so on)of acceptable quality.andM;Applause provides two typefaces (although the documentation calls it eightwhen bold and italic are thrown in) with provision to add from the Bitstreamrange of fonts at extra cost.andP;  Graph Plus added nothing to the inadequatebasic Windows provision for non-PostScript printers.andP;  However, for users withPostScript machines, the position of Graph Plus was reversed since, as aWindows-based package, it can make full use of a PostScript printer.andM;Other than the fonts, there's little to distinguish the output of thepackages.andP;  Typical printer output produced by each program is shown in theillustrations, which were produced using the normal defaults.andP;  All could havebeen improved with a little adaptation of colours to the needs of black andwhite, but the illustrations show the similarity of the basic product.andO;Viewed at full scale, the clearest in terms of shading is the output ofHarvard Graphics, which made use of line as well as dot shading.andM;The three packages are offered with the ability to work with more esotericoutput devices and they're also capable of driving high-quality typesettingequipment and film recorders.andP;  All three software houses also offer acommercial slide creation service to users who send in the appropriatematerial on disk.andM;Data handlingandM;It's important to remember that business graphics programs also deal with thehandling of data.andP;  The three review packages are designed to allow charts tobe created on the basis of data which is either entered directly using theprogram's own facilities, or imported and, if necessary, edited into asuitable form.andM;Given the inter-related needs of the modern office, much of the usefulness ofa business graphics package must depend on the degree to which it canintegrate with the other software in use.andP;  All three packages recognize thisand allow imports from a variety of data-handling programs and, to a lesserextent, export of charts and images.andP;  The widest range of imports isavailable with Applause, which can handle data files in dBase, Lotus 1-2-3and Framework formats, in addition to the fall-back options of DIF or ASCII.andM;With graphic files, Applause recognizes PCX and TIF, together with a numberof less common formats.andP;  Export formats are less impressive, with thefacility to create HPGL or PostScript files, or to pass material to anotherprogram in the GX2 graphics metafile format.andP;  Import facilities in HarvardGraphics aren't as extensive, covering Lotus 1-2-3, Excel, other SPC productsand ASCII formats.andM;Export formats cover other SPC products, Encapsulated PostScript, HPGL andthe infrequently used CGM graphics metafile format.andP;  Graph Plus allows importfrom Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel and Multiplan SLK files, together with DIF andASCII formats.andP;  Export is disappointing but material can be passed to otherMicrografx programs or to other Windows programs, such as PageMaker, usingthe PIC format.andM;Applause is the most friendly when it comes to importing of data.andP;  It allowsthe importing of a spreadsheet of up to 256x8192 in size, relying on theprogram's flexible selection facilities to extract the relevant values forthe chart.andP;  The complexity of the process is softened by a warm-link facilitywhich allows users to specify that if the same spreadsheet is imported on asubsequent occasion, with changes to the values involved, an identicalprocess of selection will be applied, rather than having to be set up afresheach time.andM;Harvard Graphics takes a more selective approach.andP;  Series titles have to beentered manually rather than imported and ranges have to be specified by nameor address -- in most cases users will need to examine the spreadsheet andtake detailed notes on its structure before importing.andP;  For frequently usedworksheets it's possible to set up templates containing the lists of materialto be imported, which obviously saves time.andP;  One shortcut is to set up thedata ranges in the worksheet by defining a graph and then importing all thematerial involved by simply specifying the graph name.andM;The most limiting of the three in import terms is Graph Plus, which imports awide range of formats directly but doesn't recognize cells containingformulae.andP;  Rather than translating into straight values, such cells aremerely left blank.andP;  While the problem can be overcome by converting formulaeto values in the spreadsheet before importing, this is a irritating andunnecessary limitation which makes Graph Plus less attractive.andM;Once material has been imported, the programs vary widely in their ability toedit and manipulate it.andP;  The most impressive in editing terms is Applause,which uses standard cursor keys and offers a set of commands to copy, move,insert and so on.andP;  A small range of calculations can be applied to selectedcells, allowing cumulation, the application of a constant, moving averages,exponential or linear regression and forecasting.andP;  Month or number series canbe created for use in labelling and a useful series of shortcut options isprovided for the selection of blocks of material.andM;Harvard Graphics is less convenient in actual use, but it has considerablestrengths.andP;  For the purposes of labelling, a far greater variety of seriescan be created, including complex date formats and simpler numericprogressions.andP;  More important is a powerful set of 20 spreadsheet-likefunctions which can be applied to rows or series, including such facilitiesas averaging, minimum, maximum, cumulation, plus exponential, linear,logarithmic and power regression.andP;  The main frustration is that editingfacilities are relatively limited.andM;The Graph Plus worksheet is a disappointment.andP;  It looks like a standardworksheet, but the program uses the cursor move keys in an idiosyncratic andillogical way, making it difficult to use.andP;  The expected rage of editingcommands are present to delete, move or copy blocks of cells, but the rangeof mathematic operations is relatively limited, allowing sorting, cumulation,the application of a constant or translation into percentages.andP;  There's noprovision for the creation of series.andP;  The worksheet can be expanded up to16384 rows by 256 columns but anyone wishing to handle this much materialwith the editing facilities provided is welcome to try.andM;Weighing it upandM;It's difficult to make an overall assessment of three such complex programs.andO;Each program has its strengths and weaknesses and the attractiveness of eachwill vary with the context in which it's to be used.andM;In many ways, the most powerful of the three is Graph Plus, which makes gooduse of the power of Windows to present users with a stunning range ofcontrols.andP;  The strongest argument for this package will be that users arealready working in a Windows environment and will benefit from the facilityto transfer material between Graph Plus and their existing software moreeasily.andP;  It's worth noting, however, that the obverse of the detailedstrength of Graph Plus is that making the most of the program can represent adaunting task.andP;  Graph Plus is also let down by a number of other features.andO;It remains a powerful program in the right hands, but it's perhaps a littleobscure for less experienced users.andM;Between the remaining two programs the process of selection is even morefinely balanced.andP;  Applause is the more integrated of the two and its userinterface is perhaps slightly friendlier.andP;  On the other hand, HarvardGraphics shares the decision in terms of the power of its facilities.andP;  Eitherprogram will allow almost anyone to produce first-class material in anabsolute minimum of time and no one ought to take the non-Windows route tobusiness graphics without examining both.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
