At temperaturesbelow the Neel temperature a spin-flip-like dependence on magnetic fieldstrength is shown. After magnetizing in higher fields UCuGe exhibitsa small remanent magnetization. Close analogies in magnetic propertiesof UCuGe and that of tetragonal UGeY (Y = S, Se, Te) have been stated.Magnetic ordering in the compounds is probably only weakly influencedby differences in their crystal structures.</TEXT></DOC>
