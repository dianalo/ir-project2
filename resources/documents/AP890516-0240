The questio, he acknowledged, was how much sacrifice individualsand national governments were willing to make during the inevitableshakedown period.   Some signs are ominous. In France's Perigueux, young farmersprotesting EEC price levels bricked up the local prefecture,labeling their concrete barrier ``The Wall of Rural Rage.''   The trend toward fast, big and uniform is clear. Last year,takeover prices in Western European corporate mergers came to $70billion.   Mass marketing means little unsettling changes. As it stands,for example, rules sound the death knell for the pink dye in thesausages vital to a proper English breakfast, or to Danish hotdogs.   Even in Spain and Portugal, where eagerness is palpable across abroad sweep of society, many people fear a tide of northernEuropeans and their money will wash over what is left of cherishedold ways.   Already, a powerful lobby in the European Parliament, an arm ofthe EEC, is seeking to ban bullfighting.   West Germans, who have cut unemployment to below 8 percent, fretat a Spanish jobless rate approaching 20 percent. After 1992, thecommunity's 15.5 million unemployed could pitch up anywhere.   German opinion polls indicate a steadily growing skepticism overrushing into a single Europe.   In France, where Delors is from, authorities pushed hard for asingle Europe, which originally was the dream of Frenchmen JeanMonnet. But, more than most EEC citizens, the French worry out loud.   A recent poll for the daily Le Monde showed only 30 percent ofFrenchmen queried felt building Europe was a crucial priority, adrop from 43 percent when the idea was first debated in 1984.   In a briskly selling book called ``La Grande Illusion,'' theFrench financier-philosopher Alain Minc dismissed the whole idea asa ``a Darwinian nightmare.''   He warns of a wave of xenophobia and extreme nationalism acrossEurope as aggrieved sectors feel the pinch.   Almost every day, some French publication points out that after1992, any Danish dentist or Belgium barber who has seen a Cezannecan set up shop in Provence.   Jacques Chirac, Paris' mayor and a former premier, said a singleEurope was essential, but he warned France would suffer until itretooled its industries and services to be more competitive.   He warned that a real estate boom would drive rents out of reachfor Frenchmen whose earnings lag behind those of richer EECneighbors.   ``I am convinced Paris will be the capital of Europe, thegateway, for its location, communications and other attributes,''said Chirac, tempering pride with trepidation.   Europe's capital now is Brussels, home to 13,000 EEC officialsand employees, although the European Parliament still meets inStrasbourg and some administration is done in Luxembourg.   The old Belgian city is an apt microcosm of a future singleEurope.   Brussels residents are split between the little nation's twoofficial languages, which are a source of occasionally violentconflict along the borders between Wallony and Flanders.   The EEC's glass-paneled Berlaymont building, rising above thesnapping colors of 12 separate states and their common standard ofstars on blue, symbolizes the grand dream.   But most visitors prefer the Grand Place, a timeworn squarelined with elaborate Renaissance office-mansions that housed guildsof fiercely independent craftsmen who did things the old way.   Brussels receives television broadcasts from seven countries.And viewers cringe when a British Broadcasting Corp. newscastersays a British Cabinet minister is ``going to Europe.''   In the spirit of things, the telephone book is thick withprivate businesses that prefix their name with ``Euro.'' One sells48 kinds of Eurokitsch, including jogging pants and pillows.   Another, a sandblasting company, draws chuckles from those whohave grown dubious of the dream: Eurofacade.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 21</NOTE></DOC>
