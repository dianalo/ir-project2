<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-0681 </DOCNO><TEXT>R andamp; D work on hydrogenation of coal in India has been carried out almostentirely in the Central Fuel Research Institute (CFRI). In the area ofbasic investigations, the achievements realized on catalysis for liquidphase hydrogenation and also for refining of the primary middle oil,kinetics and reaction mechanism, secondary processing for upgrading ofselected product fractions, application of knowledge of coal structureand the like have been presented. The pilot plant at CFRI having a capacityof 0.5 tpd coal has been brought into operation and is being modifiedfor overcoming some mechanical problems for long duration runs. Attemptshave also been made to develop conceptual flow sheets for industrialapplication of the process. Special care is to be taken to accommodatehigh ash coals. Considering the coals of Raniganj area, it was conceptuallyworked out that the raw coal having 20-24% ash can be used by combiningthe oil agglomeration technique for coal beneficiation with the hydrogenationprocess. The extensive work carried out in the USA and Federal Republicof Germany over the last two decades has established the technical feasibilityof the process - it can be deployed industrially at any stage now, ifrequired. The market potential of the product, however, is still notfavourable. R andamp; D work is, therefore, in progress though on a smallerscale to make it scientifically and technically more efficient and commerciallymore attractive. Synthetic oil research should be kept alive in India.Simultaneously, diversified application of the hydrogenation reactionshould be explored to develop products of national importance for otherindustrial sectors like iron making. 23 refs., 4 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
