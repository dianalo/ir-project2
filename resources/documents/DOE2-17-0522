The deconvolutionand convolution problems are solved by three analytical methods usinggeological characteristics of the sites and experimental bore hole experimentalpolygon for controlling the analytical results. The data from the responseanalysis are compared with real deformations and cracks in the buildingsthat have occurred during the Vranchea earthquake.</TEXT></DOC>
