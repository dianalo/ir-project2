But myresponse from the heart is, thank God for Barbara Bush,'' said cityPolice Chief Daryl F. Gates, referring to the first lady's outspokenopposition to assault weapons.   The order suspends the importation of more than 110,000assault-type weapons for which import applications are pending, saidnational drug control director William J. Bennett.   Affected by the decision are imports of AK-47s, Uzi carbines,FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug semiautomaticweapons.   On Jan. 17, a disturbed drifter, Patrick Purdy, used an AK-47 tokill five children and wound 30 other people at Grover ClevelandElementary School in Stockton.   Using the weapon, which allows the shooter to fire single shotsas quickly as he can pull the trigger, Purdy was able to fire 106bullets in two minutes. He then shot and killed himself with ahandgun.   A rising death toll from the use of semiautomatic weapons in gangwarfare had already prompted an outcry against the guns. But theStockton tragedy crystallized opposition and led to a nationwidemovement to ban assault weapons.   On Monday, the California Assembly narrowly passed legislationthat would virtually ban the sale of all semiautomatic assaultweapons. The weapons have already been banned by local ordinances inLos Angeles and Cleveland.   Van De Kamp said he thought the Stockton shootings and the moveto restrict assault weapons in California ``have had a tremendousimpact on the administration's thinking on this issue.''   Assemblyman Michael Roos of Los Angeles, who wrote the Assemblybill, said he ``can't stop shaking from the excitement.''   ``Not in my wildest imagination would I have ever dreamed thatwithin 24 hours of the Assembly taking action that the United Statesgovernment ... would effectively ban the importation of theseweapons,'' Roos said.   The state Senate passed a similar bill last week. The differencesbetween that bill and the House's must be resolved before thegovernor can sign legislation.   The Bush administration's action Tuesday also brought praise fromRoberg Strang, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administrationin New York.   ``Certainly, anything that's done is helpful to us,'' Strangsaid. ``In the last year, agents across the country have been issuedsubmachine guns because of the automatic weapons that we're upagainst on a daily basis. ... Certainly, anything we can do tolessen the firepower of the drug traffickers is going to bebeneficial to us.''</TEXT></DOC>
