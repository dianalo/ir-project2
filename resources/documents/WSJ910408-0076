The regulatory role of the nation's central bank alreadyis being threatened by new Treasury-backed plans to overhaulthe banking system. These plans would make the Office ofComptroller of the Currency the dominant bank regulator.</LP><TEXT>   Now, the Fed is increasingly under fire for its failure tointervene earlier in the case of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg)S.A., which government investigators say covertly andillegally holds a controlling stake in the parent company ofFirst American Bankshares Inc., the capital's biggest bankholding company. The Fed also is drawing criticism for itsfailure to uncover more than $3 billion in illicit loans toIraq from the Atlanta-based branch of Italy's state-ownedBanca Nazionale del Lavoro.   The House Banking Committee &quot;is seriously troubled bycontinuing revelations of misdeeds by foreign banks operatingin the U.S.&quot; and by &quot;the apparent lack of oversight by theFederal Reserve,&quot; Chairman Henry Gonzalez wrote Fed ChairmanAlan Greenspan recently. The Texas Democrat accuses the Fedof a &quot;hear no evil, see no evil&quot; approach to regulation.   The Fed declines to discuss the two scandals, citing itsown and other continuing investigations into the BNL and BCCIaffairs. But it has its defenders elsewhere. &quot;Thefinger-pointing after the fact is directed at the regulatorsas though they are omniscient,&quot; says Peter Wallison, aWashington-based partner with the Los Angeles law firm ofGibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher. But the Fed and other regulators&quot;have to rely on the good faith and honesty of {those who arebeing regulated} and their outside counsel,&quot; he says.   Nonetheless, the Fed's supporters acknowledge that the twoscandals will be used to discredit the Fed by those who wantto diminish its role. The scandals, says one former top bankregulator, &quot;are ammunition for those who say the comptrollershould get it all&quot; when it comes to bank regulation.   In its limited public testimony on the BNL affair, the Fedhas argued that it can't necessarily catch determinedfraudsters. That was the case at the Atlanta branch, whichthe Fed's banking supervision director, William Taylor,portrayed in congressional testimony last fall as a &quot;massivefraud in which a large number of employees acted together toconceal the operation and deceive auditors and examiners.&quot;   The BCCI/First American imbroglio is harder for the Fed toexplain, however. In recent weeks it has become clear thatfor years BCCI covertly held a controlling stake in FirstAmerican's parent company. Yet despite widespread andlong-held suspicions about First American's links with BCCI,the Fed seemingly contented itself with the outcome of a 1981hearing at which Washington lawyers Clark Clifford and RobertAltman -- who later also became First American's chairman andpresident -- gave assurances that BCCI wouldn't have a rolein running or controlling First American.   It wasn't until late last year, after receivinginformation from Manhattan District Attorney RobertMorgenthau outlining BCCI's control of First American, thatthe Fed finally moved into action. It issued two orders, onethat insisted BCCI and First American keep their businessesseperate and another that requires BCCI within two months toproduce a plan to sell its stake in First American. Messrs.Clifford and Altman say that if the Fed was deceived, so werethey.   It also looks now as though the Fed should have lookedmore closely at other matters reviewed in the 1981 hearing.   For example, describing the financial arrangements for thetakeover, Mr. Altman told the 1981 hearing that a bank loanof $50 million was being obtained from &quot;a European consortiumbank which is an affiliate of Banque Nationale de Paris,&quot; tocomplement the $130 million in cash put up to buy FinancialGeneral Bankshares, as First American was then known.   But neither he nor Mr. Clifford identified the bank. Itturned out to be Banque Arabe et Internationaled'Investissement, an Arab-French consortium run by YvesLamarche, a director of BCCI and a longtime friend of BCCI'sfounder and architect, Agha Hasan Abedi. Mr. Lamarche's bankwas taken over by the French government last year; he remainsa director of BCCI.   While Mr. Altman acknowleges he was aware that Mr.Lamarche was a friend of Mr. Abedi, he insists he disclosedat the hearing &quot;everything that I knew at the time&quot; that was&quot;relevant.&quot; He also says that Fed officials could havelearned more about the source of the money by examininginformation filed on the financing.   But Fed regulators present at the time are upset. &quot;Basedon all the press reports, there were a lot of facts we wereunaware of,&quot; says John Ryan, who served as head of theFederal Reserve's banking-supervision department in 1981 andwho helped represent the Fed at the hearing. &quot;I feel wedidn't get all the facts.&quot;   Fed critics say the Fed's lack of knowledge is hard tofathom. They say that even by the early 1980s, most big bankswouldn't deal directly with BCCI, and some even wonderedabout its links with First American. &quot;If the banking systemknew this, how could {the regulators} fail to act?&quot; asks JackBlum, who acted as chief investigator to a Senate ForeignRelations subcommittee that started looking into BCCI in 1988because of its links to drug-money launderers. There is eventaped evidence dating back to 1988 recording a senior BCCIofficer as saying his bank controlled First American.   &quot;Somebody,&quot; Mr. Blum says, &quot;is responsible for minding thestore.&quot;   At the same time as the BCCI scandal unfolds, a grand juryin Atlanta is unraveling the complicated story behind thebillions of dollars of loans that the local branch of Italy'sBNL made to Iraq. BNL was one of the more significant sourcesof funding for a complicated Iraqi scheme to obtainsophisticated Western technology and know-how.   Among other things, the Banking Committee is even pursuingthe possibility of a link between the two scandals. DuringJuly 27-29, 1989, more than $20 million was transferredbetween the two institutions, committee investigators say.   Whether or not BNL had ties to BCCI, though, Rep. Gonzalezsays the scandal raises serious questions about the Fed'swatchfulness. He terms the BNL affair &quot;a sensational bankfraud and regulatory blunder&quot; that illustrates &quot;an absence ofregulatory oversight.&quot;   ---                      Bank Watchdogs                                                                                                          The three major federal bank-regulatory operations                                                                                                                                                          FEDERAL                                  COMPTROLLER      DEPOSIT                      FEDERAL        OF THE       INSURANCE                      RESERVE       CURRENCY        CORP.*                                                                                                        Banks regulated       1,047         4,006          7,357 Assets (billions)      $575        $1,983           $845 Bank examiners        1,025         2,350          2,700 Bank failures, 1990      10            95            168                                                                                                          *Regulatory role would be phased out under Treasury'sbanking-law overhaul proposals.
