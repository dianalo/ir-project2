Fair or not to Mr. Quayle, the silencedeprived contingency-fee lawyers and other interested partiesof any warning about some potent proposals the White Houseplans for reforming the litigation system.   &quot;I don't want to bash lawyers,&quot; Mr. Quayle said (notingthat this group includes his wife and him), and so bashed thelegal system instead. He said that by now every neurosurgeonin Washington, D.C., has been sued at least once, there's onelawsuit filed each year for every 15 Americans and theliability crisis is now a $300 billion annual drag on theeconomy.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It used to be that people could reach across the table,shake hands and know they had a deal,&quot; Mr. Quayle told theannual conference of the U.S. Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit, but the law has been corrupted to the pointwhere &quot;the idea of binding agreements is almost laughed at.&quot;He also criticized the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law. He said, &quot;No wonder people lose confidencewhen legitimate businessmen -- even parties to divorceactions -- have found themselves in federal court,characterized as `racketeers' under a law that was clearlyaimed at criminal organizations.&quot;   The big news in Mr. Quayle's speech was that theCompetitiveness Council he runs in the White House soon willget a report from its Working Group on Civil Justice Reform,which is headed by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. Thegroup, which includes Justice, Commerce and TreasuryDepartment representatives, has some ambitious proposals forlegislative and judicial reforms on how we try cases.   According to sources in the working group, one proposal isno less than to abolish punitive damages. This would be awonderful contribution to justice. These quasi-criminal finesonce were limited to egregious intentional injuries, but noware routinely doled out as punishment in even the mosttrivial accidents. Punitives have become a serious drag onthe economy, creating enormous and unpredictable costs andeven bankruptcy (remember Texaco). The occasional plaintiffand contingency-fee lawyer get windfalls, but the purpose ofcivil litigation is to compensate for losses, not toredistribute money. A law abolishing punitive damages alsowould save the Supreme Court from again having to considerwhen these arbitrary punishments violate constitutional dueprocess.   Any proposal by the White House to abolish punitivedamages probably would cover only federal cases, though withmany state judges encouraging juries to sock it toout-of-state defendants there's an argument for abolishingpunitives in the states as well. Punitive damages have beenabolished in several states with no apparent harm.   The group also plans to cut back on the costly andtime-wasting discovery process. &quot;Anyone who has ever beensued or whose company has been sued knows that discoveryrules allow lawyers to go on what is essentially a cost-freefishing expedition,&quot; Mr. Quayle said in his speech. He saidone proposal the group is considering is a return to therequirement that parties plead their cases in some detail. Nolonger could parties start cases simply by alleging somegeneral wrong and ask to see all the other side'smemorandums, reports and analyses. Nor could defendants anylonger insist on thousands of pages of depositions to harassa plaintiff with a good case into settling for less nowrather than suffer justice delayed.   The working group also wants to encourage more control bytrial judges over abusive discovery. Once a case is filed,judges would create a &quot;discovery plan&quot; that would limit theamount of fishing on both sides. The working group is alsoconsidering a neat way of ending the abusive use of warring&quot;expert witnesses&quot; in trials. This would be to limit thepercentage of income a person can earn by testifying intrials and still be judicially recognized as an expert in afield.   Among the other ideas under consideration is changing theway we finance lawsuits by forcing the losing party to paythe winner's legal bills. This is called the English rule onattorneys' fees, though more accurately it is theEverywhere-but-America rule. Mr. Quayle said the idea mightbe controversial, but it could be &quot;a powerful incentiveagainst frivolous and abusive litigation.&quot; (I got interestedin the subject after studying law in England and the U.S., sowas asked by the working group to brief them on the Englishrule.)   In its pure application, winners of lawsuits (plaintiffsor defendants) would have their legal rights totallyvindicated by not being stuck with any legal bill when thecase ends. Another version of the idea is that parties whoturn down reasonable settlement offers and then lose at trialmust pay the other side's legal bills. One proposal underserious consideration is for losers in federal cases exceptfor civil-rights cases to pay at least some of the otherside's discovery costs.   Once the White House proposes these changes, it will befascinating to see how the politics plays out. Almost no onedefends the American way of trying cases, or doubts that manyuseful products are unavailable here because of unreasonablelitigation risks. The added costs of legal uncertaintyclearly make U.S. businesses less competitive. All this makeslegal reform a popular cause, which means there is somechance that the debate won't be partisan in the predictableway.   Indeed, a recent meeting of the working group included abroad collection of legal experts, from Robert Bork andfederal appeals Judge Frank Easterbrook to federal appealsJudge Stephen Breyer, who was chief counsel to the SenateJudiciary Committee under Sen. Edward Kennedy, and MarkGitenstein, who held the same post in Sen. Joseph Biden'sJudiciary Committee. The president-elect of the American BarAssociation also attended.   Punitive damages didn't come up, but according to severalparticipants, there was little disagreement on the broadpoint that the civil-justice system needs a major overhaul.There was even a consensus that we should move to someversion of the English rule, at least when the discoveryprocess is abused in cases between big corporations.   The main lobbying group in opposition to reform, asalways, will be the contingency-fee plaintiff lawyers. Theinfluence of the Association of Trial Lawyers of Americanever should be underestimated, especially in a Congress thatincludes several former members.   On the other hand, legal reform apparently has a championin Mr. Quayle, who could use the &quot;gravitas&quot; of taking on aserious issue. The political pundits would never imagine thata lightweight could reverse several decades of the litigationexplosion.</TEXT></DOC>
