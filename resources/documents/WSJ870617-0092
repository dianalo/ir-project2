Leaseway said that 78.7% of the shares outstanding voted in favor of the previously reported proposal. Gerald C. McDonough, Leaseway chairman and chief executive officer and one of the investors, said he expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the month.    Shareholder ratification followed a Delaware court's denial Friday of a shareholder's request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the leveraged buyout.    Leaseway directors approved the transaction in November. Citicorp Capital is a unit of Citicorp, the New York financial holding company.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Leaseway closed yesterday at $50.75, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
