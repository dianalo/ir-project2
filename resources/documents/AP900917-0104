Oil prices jumped Monday, pointing to pessimism about prospectsfor a settlement of the 6{-week-old Persian Gulf standoff. Oilfutures soared to record levels, above $33 a barrel, on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   In a sign of Iraq's growing isolation, the Soviet Union,Baghdad's longtime patron, said Monday it would re-establishdiplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis infuriated Iraq byagreeing to become the main staging ground for the deployment of aU.S.-led multinational force after the Aug. 2 Iraqi takeover ofKuwait.   Sensitivities about the role of the U.S. force were underscoredwhen a top U.S. military man was sacked after discussingcontingency plans to launch massive air strikes against Baghdad andtarget Saddam personally.   The fired official, Air Force chief of staff Gen. Mike Dugan,made the remarks while touring U.S. military installations in SaudiArabia, and they were published Sunday in The Washington Post andthe Los Angeles Times.   ``There are certain things we never talk about. We never discussoperational matters, such as the selection of specific targets forpotential air strikes,'' an angry Defense Secretary Dick Cheneytold reporters in Washington. He dismissed Dugan after consultingPresident Bush.   Bush, meanwhile, said he considered Americans to be``magnificently united'' behind the U.S. military effort in thegulf, but he cautioned, ``I'm not clear in my own mind on how longthis kind of support holds up.''   At a news conference Monday, the president said he wanted tobring home the 150,000 U.S. troops in the region ``as soon aspossible'' but did not know when that would be.   Arab radical groups, meanwhile, ended a three-day conference inAmman, Jordan on Monday with calls for suicide attacks on the U.S.forces.   ``We have the striking examples of heroes who turned theirbodies into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them toflee in darkness,'' Libyan Ibrahim Al-Kharraz told delegates,referring to the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut thatkilled 241 U.S. servicemen.   In Iraq, there was an outburst of anti-American sentiment in thestate-run newspapers Monday, a day after Iraqi television broadcastan eight-minute message from Bush to the Iraqi people. ``Shut Up,Mr. Bush,'' one headline said.   Bush's videotaped message, in which he warned that Saddam wasleading Iraq into war, was followed immediately by an Iraqicommentary blasting the speech as ``full of lies andcontradictions.'' Hundreds of demonstrators then took to thestreets of Baghdad, chanting ``Death to Bush!'' and ``Death toAmerica!''   The Bush administration said the hostile reaction demonstratedthe effectiveness of Bush's message. ``They obviously felt it wasnecessary to try to discredit the United States as much aspossible,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   At the Kuwait-Saudi border, Iraqi troops unexpectedly opened theonly border crossing over the weekend, and about 6,000 Kuwaitisfled their homeland. The flow slowed to a trickle Monday.   Refugees said Iraqi troops were seizing draft-age Kuwaiti menand forcing their wives and daughters to travel to Saudi Arabiawithout them. U.S. officials expressed concern over Kuwaitis beingforced to leave their identity papers with Iraqi border guards.   ``The confiscation of identity papers is an ominous sign thatthese citizens of Kuwait may not be allowed to return to theirhomes,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``If thisis part of an Iraqi effort to drive Kuwaitis from their homes, itis unacceptable.''   In Brussels, Belgium, the 12 European Community nationsannounced they would expel Iraqi military attaches and their staffsand restrict travel by other embassy personnel to protest break-insby Iraqi troops at diplomatic premises in occupied Kuwait lastweek.   The Iraqi raids on Dutch, French, Belgian and Canadian embassiesor diplomatic residences were unanimously condemned Sunday by theU.N. Security Council.   Britain said Monday it was deporting eight diplomats and 23Iraqi nationals deemed a danger to national security, and WestGermany gave walking papers to the Iraqi military attache's staff.Italy said Monday it was expelling 11 Iraqi Embassy employees whoworked in the military attache's office.   The EC ministers were also weighing a possible air blockade ofIraq to enforce the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq. BritishForeign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there was strong support amongthe EC ministers for such a blockade.   The Belgian foreign affairs minister, Mark Eyskens, concurred.   ``Everybody was arguing for an air blockade,'' he said.   Hurd said, however, that it was important to obtain backing fromthe U.N. Security Council for such a step. U.N. diplomats on Sundaybegan drafting a new resolution to close Iraq's air routes andpunish nations flouting the embargo, U.S. officials said.   An air blockade would involve the interception of planesapproaching Iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggeringhostilities than the boarding of ships in the Persian Gulf.   Hurd also renewed complaints about Iraq's treatment of diplomatsin Kuwait, where about a dozen nations, including the UnitedStates, are defying Baghdad's orders to close their embassies.   ``They are surrounded by soldiers, they can't get food or drinkin,'' Hurd said.   In other developments:   -Four French nationals - a married couple and two men - arrivedin Amman, Jordan on Monday after being freed from Iraq. They saidthey were held in a site about an hour from Baghdad with about 10other hostages, including an American. Iraq is using trappedWesterners as human shields against attack on key Iraqiinstallations.   -Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said three Irishmen hadbeen jailed in Iraq on charges of attempting to escape the country.Also, West Germany said Iraqi troops seized another West German inKuwait, raising to 44 the number of West Germans held by Baghdad.   -An Egyptian military source said Egypt was sending 250 soldiersto Saudi Arabia Monday and more would follow in a few days, joiningthe estimated 4,000 Egyptian troops in the region.   -A senior Iranian delegation met in Baghdad with an Iraqi teamto discuss normalization of ties between the two nations, whichfought a war from 1980 to 1988. Saddam last month initiated aprisoner exchange, agreed to shared sovereignty over a key waterwaythat forms the southern border between the two countries, andremoved troops from Iranian territory captured during the war. Butthe Red Cross says the month-long prisoner exchange has stopped.   -In Beijing, 42 Kuwaiti athletes and a coach arrived Monday totake part in the Asian Games, which begin Saturday. Kuwait'sNational Olympic Committee, now based in exile in Saudi Arabia,said athletes who were out of the country during the Iraq's Aug. 2invasion would participate.</TEXT></DOC>
