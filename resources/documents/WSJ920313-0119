In 1984, groups of terrorists swept through the town,murdering dozens of its inhabitants. The survivors fled,abandoning their potato crop. The Huancapi potatoes --diverse, resistant to pests and disease, and delicious --were a genetic treasure. Now they would be lost forever, andwith them another increment of the world's biodiversity.</LP><TEXT>   Four years later, when the villagers of Huancapi returnedto their abandoned farms and wrecked homes, they contactedthe Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP), or InternationalPotato Center here. Agents of the CIP earlier had collectedseeds from the village and stored them away as part of itsworld potato collection (300 different species, 4,500different varieties). They were able to restore many ofHuancapi's unique potatoes to cultivation.   When a Wall Street Journal reporter visited the CIP 15years ago and wrote about its activities, the center was busypreparing for just such a genetic crisis. Carlos Ochoa,potato hunter, was trekking all over South America atconsiderable personal risk to gather as many potato varietiesas possible before they were lost to disease, development ordesertification.   On one expedition, Mr. Ochoa was collecting wild potatoesin the mountains of Northern Peru when he says he suddenlyheard someone scream from above: &quot;Catch him alive]&quot; Mr. Ochoafired shots into the air. The attackers responded by rollingrocks down the mountain, but Mr. Ochoa managed to hide in atrench and then ran away. &quot;They must have thought I was atreasure hunter,&quot; says Mr. Ochoa. &quot;And they were right.Potatoes are much more precious than a jewel.&quot;   It is the same spirit that has animated many of history'sseed-bank guardians, from the swashbuckling plant explorersof the 1920s to the heroic scientists of Leningrad'sInstitute of Plant Industry -- who, under Hitler's siege,starved to death one by one rather than eat any of thesamples of rice, peas, corn and wheat that guaranteed theircountrymen's postwar food supply.   By now the CIP has collected most of the known potatospecies (three of them, or about 1% of the world's potatoes,are named after Mr. Ochoa), and the center is turning itsattention to the production of new strains to fend off thepossibility of large-scale famine as the globe's populationincreases.   Perhaps the most exciting potato in the CIP at the momentis the &quot;hairy potato.&quot; By cross-breeding domestic varietieswith a wild Bolivian potato species called Solanumberthaultii, which is inedible and has hairy foliage, theCIP-working jointly with Cornell University -- has come upwith an edible potato that is resistant to all major potatopests and costs less to produce. &quot;Insects get trapped in thehair and die,&quot; explains Dr. Ali Golmirzaie, a geneticist herewho works on the project. &quot;The hairy potato saves costs byreducing the need for pesticides.&quot;   &quot;You should make clear that the hair isn't on thepotatoes,&quot; says K.V. Raman, a CIP entomologist. &quot;It's on thefoliage.&quot;   While it works within the Consultative Group onInternational Agricultural Research, a group of 16 centersthat look into increasing all the world's major crops, theCIP thinks its product has an edge. The potato yields morenutritious food faster, on less land and in more variedclimates than any other major crop, it says. One acre ofpotatoes can yield 50% more calories than an acre of grain.   So CIP scientists, with an annual budget of $18 millioncoming from governments and multilateral organizations, arehard at work discovering ways to produce potatoes that cangrow anywhere, resist diseases, mature quickly, store welland generate regular yields without extensive pesticides orfertilizer use.   &quot;What's in this room is indispensable,&quot; says John Dodds,head of genetic resources at the CIP as he shows a visitorinto a &quot;growth room&quot; and then opens a door into an adjoining,similar room where the ambient temperature is 6 degreesCelsius. &quot;You probably have here about 80% of the potatoesknown to mankind.&quot;   In fact, there is not a single potato in the room, butrather a sort of collection of potato bonsais. The room isfilled with rows and rows of shelves that house collectionsof hermetically sealed test tubes. Inside the test tubes isthe seed material, or germplasm, of most of the existingpotato varieties -- in triplicate, just in case. The storagerooms are earthquake-proof. Terrorists have twice attackedthe CIP's field station in the town of Huancayo, withoutexplaining why. The potato center considered moving toneighboring Ecuador after the attacks, but instead simplymoved some of its activities -- and copies of its collection-- there.   Within a few years, the potato on your plate might wellhave originated in a laboratory where scientists, throughgenetic engineering, have introduced desirable traits oreliminated diseases. For instance, the CIP is currentlyworking on transplanting synthetic genes, or genes fromcertain silk moths, into potatoes to eliminate a variety ofpests. &quot;We're genetically engineering the potato plant tocontain genes whose toxins kill the potato tuber moth,&quot; saysPeter Gregory, the CIP's research director. The CIP is alsoengineering potatoes that are resistant to drought or heat orhave higher salt tolerance. But Mr. Gregory says it could beabout five years before these potatoes are &quot;actually on thetable&quot; because of regulatory and safety uncertaintiessurrounding biotechnology.   Meanwhile, the CIP is also working hard on natural methodsto eliminate pests by developing biological pesticides,friendly fungi, pest-devouring bacteria or aphrodisiac trapsthat protect potatoes. &quot;What we're looking for is integratedpest management,&quot; says Mr. Raman.   Recent finds include the beauveria brongniartii, aninsect-killing fungus, made from residues of barley husk,that is cheap and provides &quot;excellent weevil control,&quot; Mr.Raman says. Potato losses from weevil damage in the Andeancountries of Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador areestimated at $17 million a year, and Mr. Raman says thingslike the fungus he has developed could save potato farmers$105 million in pesticide annually.   Potato authorities here say all this research is alreadypaying off. Third World potato production is rising, and newcountries, like Bhutan or Madagascar, are becoming producersthanks to the CIP's regional offices that disseminate itsfindings. &quot;The potato,&quot; says Gregory Scott, a CIPagricultural economist, &quot;is coming into its own.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
