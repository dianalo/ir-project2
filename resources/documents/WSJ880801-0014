Late Friday, after more than four months of negotiations with bidders, regulators turned over management of 40 of First RepublicBank's banking units to NCNB, which agreed to jointly own the banks with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for five years. NCNB agreed to put up $210 million for an initial 20% stake in the new Texas bank, and it expects to raise the stake during the five-year span. It's a bold gamble in the hard-scrabble economy of Texas, but the FDIC also granted the North Carolina company substantial protection against further Texas loan losses.    Federal banking officials flexed muscle newly bestowed by Congress in stripping First RepublicBank of almost all its bank units. Several were solvent, but the officials declared them insolvent and agreed in principle to transfer them to NCNB, a Southeast banking giant. The agreement calls for about $4 billion in government aid, the second-largest bailout in banking history.    The move wiped out the interests of shareholders and left debt holders to pick from the slim remains of an insolvent holding company with about $1 billion of debt. Panicky security holders, fearing such steps, pushed bond and stock prices of First RepublicBank, which isn't related to San Francisco's First Republic Bancorp, to record lows Friday in heavy trading.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, First RepublicBank shares closed at 75 cents, down 25 cents, in heavy trading of almost 2.2 million shares. The bailout announcement came after the market's close. First RepublicBank bonds closed as low as 11 cents on the dollar Friday. They had previously been trading in the range of 18 cents to 25 cents on the dollar.    The First RepublicBank plan is sending a signal to major bank creditors, including some of the nation's largest insurance companies and investment firms, that they rank almost with common stockholders and could face severe losses if a bank gets into trouble. In previous large federal bailouts, bondholders received settlements ranging from 100% protection to partial settlements. Likewise, in the past shareholders have received a fractional stake in the surviving institution. But the FDIC said recently that it is under no obligation to protect shareholders or creditors of failed banks.    Several of First RepublicBank's bondholders are considering court action and the FDIC said one lawsuit had already been filed. &quot;This has irritated the most loyal buyers of bank debt,&quot; said Jay H. Lustig, a vice president of Los Angeles Securites, a Santa Monica, Calif. investment firm and major First RepublicBank bondholder. &quot;What happened at First RepublicBank is going to create somewhat of a problem for weaker banks,&quot; when many require additional capital and credit, said an official close to First RepublicBank.    What remains of the Texas company, which was the state's largest banking concern with $26.9 billion in assets, is considering seeking bankruptcy court protection this week. Some bondholders predicted that legal action seeking to void the transfer of the banks would follow and U.S. bank regulators acknowledged that there would be major investor losses. First RepublicBank officials briefly mulled asking a court to block the transfer over the weekend, but decided against it. Questions on the bailout are certain to come up at a House committee hearing Wednesday.    Still, First RepublicBank's failure and the arrival in Texas of NCNB ends an ill-fated merger of two Dallas banking companies and solves the biggest problem the state's financial sector had faced since the Southwest's banking crisis began two years ago. &quot;We can go back to business in Texas,&quot; proclaimed H. Ross Perot, the influential Texas billionaire who was disclosed Friday to be a backer of the plan.    With First RepublicBank's bailout, only two of Texas's top 10 banking companies have survived without a government rescue or a takeover from a better-capitalized company: MCorp, Texas's second-largest banking company, based in Dallas, and San Antonio's Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. While Cullen/Frost appears out of danger, MCorp is saddled with an unhealthy level of bad loans and is struggling to raise capital without federal aid.    The state's upheaval has put up for grabs billions of dollars of banking business. But NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., won't find easy pickings. Three recapitalized Texas banks -- Chemical Banking Corp.'s Texas Commerce Bancshares, First Interstate Bancorp's Texas operation and First City Bancorp. of Texas -- are aggressively jockeying for business.    Under the bailout's terms, NCNB shares ownership of the Texas bank with the FDIC through an initial 20% stake, although the FDIC granted it voting control. The company has a five-year option to buy the FDIC stake at a price formula that averages about 107% of book value.    Hugh L. McColl Jr., NCNB's chairman and chief executive officer, grinning and confident at a Saturday news conference in Dallas, predicted that NCNB would acquire the bank, and possibly in less time. &quot;We can't think of any condition where we wouldn't acquire it,&quot; he said.    The FDIC's $4 billion aid package calls for it to erase First RepublicBank's $1.1 billion in negative equity, forgive the $1 billion emergency loan the FDIC gave the Texas bank in March and invest as much as $960 million for an initial 80% stake in the new institution, NCNB Texas National Bank, which opened Saturday. Also, the FDIC agreed to assume all of the costs and losses for a $5 billion pool of bad loans and foreclosed real estate, which the FDIC figures will cost an additional $1 billion. The bad loans won't be broken off into a liquidating bank subsidiary until NCNB owns a majority of the stock.    NCNB also got an elaborate firewall to protect it from the kind of unforeseen loan troubles that have befallen other Texas bank buyers. NCNB says it didn't adequately study First RepublicBank's loan portfolio, so it wrangled from the FDIC a guarantee to limit NCNB's loan losses for two years on the &quot;good&quot; loans it will keep. During that time, NCNB may also shed some of those loans by transferring them to the $5 billion pool.    What's more, a special tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service will allow NCNB to use the losses from the pool of bad assets to shelter taxes on the FDIC assistance and profits generated by the &quot;good&quot; side of the bank for several years. Finally, the bad asset pool won't affect NCNB's consolidated income statement until NCNB raises its stake in the Texas bank to 50% from its initial 20%.    The only private capital for the transaction is $210 million NCNB expects to raise to purchase the 20% stake in the Texas institution. It plans to liquidate a securities portfolio and privately place a new issue of convertible preferred stock. However, to avoid the money-raising delays that held up the bailout of Houston's First City, the FDIC got assurances from Mr. Perot that he would personally advance the money to close the deal within 90 days.    The FDIC said NCNB was the lowest-cost plan by about $1 billion. There were five bidders, including some Texas businessmen, Wells Fargo andamp; Co., a San Francisco banking heavyweight, and First RepublicBank's new management team. Citicorp, the nation's largest banking firm, withdrew its bid after deciding that it didn't want to commit so many people to the Texas problem.    The FDIC didn't publicly estimate the final cost of NCNB's plan except to say that it probably would exceed the $1.7 billion loss it has incurred so far in the $4.5 billion rescue of Continental Illinois Corp. FDIC insiders have estimated a $3 billion cost to the Texas transaction. The agency has previously forecast a 10% drop in its $18.3 billion insurance fund by year-end. It added Friday that the latest rescue wouldn't alter that.    Besides its lower cost, the NCNB plan apparently had other advantages. &quot;This bank has acquired a great number of banks. We believe they are a very competent group,&quot; L. William Seidman, FDIC chairman, said. Another NCNB plus was that, unlike First RepublicBank's management plan, it didn't require any exchange of stock or debt. Nor would NCNB have problems trying to raise $210 million, compared with the $1 billion First RepublicBank's plan required. No one expects Mr. Perot to have to come up with the funds if NCNB can't. His involvement, Mr. Seidman said, was &quot;to show Texas connections, Texas support.&quot;    Following the Continental Illinois rescue, Congress granted the FDIC powers to erect a &quot;bridge bank&quot; to transfer a failed bank from one owner to another. A bridge bank, which can be chartered by the FDIC for as long as three years, can assume the failed banks of a troubled holding company. Thus, the FDIC &quot;wouldn't have to support the holding company,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. &quot;It was a totally different transaction from Continental Illinois because there was a bridge bank available.&quot;    Every one of the bidders except First RepublicBank management envisioned using the bridge bank not only to duck shareholders and creditors but to escape an escalating number of lawsuits that have been filed against First RepublicBank. Many of those suits, brought by investors and creditors, accuse the banking company of misleading investors last year when it sold $200 million of preferred stock and debt to pay for the merger that created First RepublicBank.    Whatever the reasons, the regulators' action brought a sense of doom to the streets of Dallas and other Texas cities late last week. As the fate of Texas's largest bank dangled for months, business executives, civic leaders and customers waited nervously for a conclusion. When word leaked in June that Citicorp was a bidder, some proud Texans protested at First RepublicBank's annual meeting that Texas's largest bank shouldn't become the province of &quot;Yankees.&quot;    Last Thursday, scores of bank examiners quietly arrived in Dallas, Houston and other major Texas cities to begin an inventory of First RepublicBank's 40 banks that would lead to a declaration that the institutions were, indeed, failing.    On Friday, the FDIC set off a series of events that led to the bank officially being declared a failure. First, the FDIC said it wouldn't renew its $1 billion loan to the Dallas bank that it granted last March after a depositor run threatened to topple the bank. Without the loan, the comptroller of the currency declared that First RepublicBank Dallas was no longer a viable bank. Then, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas demanded payment of the emergency discount-window loans it has been making to the bank. The bank was unable to repay them and the comptroller closed it Friday soon after regular business hours ended.    When the Dallas bank failed, the FDIC immediately called its $1 billion loan. Because that loan was guaranteed by certain subsidiary banks, the amount of each bank's guarantee was charged against their individual capital. &quot;Losses as a result of these charges and other intracompany transactions rendered other banks insolvent,&quot; the banking regulators said in a joint statement issued Friday night.    The FDIC also said in March that it would fully insure all deposits, and recently said it would continue that policy until the NCNB transaction is completed.    First RepublicBank's road to ruin was charted just 19 months ago when the two Dallas banking rivals, RepublicBank and InterFirst, teamed up to fend off the possibility of InterFirst being acquired by an out-of-state bank.    The $544 million merger -- without federal aid -- seemed troubled from the start. Everyone knew InterFirst was in trouble but RepublicBank's public statements hadn't hinted of any similar problems with its loan portfolio. Executives who looked at the books of both banks say they couldn't detect much of a difference.    After the merger was completed in June, the bank had about 40% of its loan portfolio in real estate, with much of it in Dallas, where values are still declining. Rather than focus on its loan problems, First RepublicBank managers pressed for cost savings from merging the two institutions. By year-end 1987, First RepublicBank had achieved the cost goals, but the loan portfolio was out of control. It posted a $656.8 million net loss for 1987, reflecting severe real estate loan losses.    But that loss was nothing compared with the $1.5 billion loss First RepublicBank recorded in the first quarter, the second-largest quarterly deficit in banking history. That came after a two-month examination by federal regulators that found serious deficiencies in the loan portfolio, including neglected appraisal schedules and overvalued real estate.    That led to the resignation of Gerald W. Fronterhouse, the former chairman and chief executive, and several old-guard directors including H.R. &quot;Bum&quot; Bright, First RepublicBank's largest individual shareholder. Mr. Bright, a wealthy oil man who is also majority owner of the Dallas Cowboys football team, was the man behind the merger. His stock loss from the bank's demise amounts to about $35 million. He said he never sold any shares because of loyalty to the bank.    ---   Robert E. Taylor in Washington contributed to this article.
