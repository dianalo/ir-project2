Lorenzo _ in his first testimony yet before the bankruptcy courtsupervising Eastern's reorganization _ spoke at a hearing overunsecured creditors' request to remove him from control of Easternin favor of a court-appointed trustee.   Eastern argues that putting an outsider in charge would hurt itschances of financial recovery. The company has been attempting toreach an agreement with the creditors to forestall such a move.   Earlier, Eastern President Phil Bakes testified that appointmentof a trustee would spark employee departures, hurt business furtherand heighten the chance Eastern eventually would have to beliquidated.   Lorenzo said that under a reorganization proposal made Monday,unsecured creditors would get 30 cents on the dollar, about 20percent of that in cash and the rest in securities. Creditors alsowould get about 8 percent of Texas Air's stock.   Creditors recently rejected an Eastern reorganization proposalthat would have paid them 27{ cents on the dollar, including 2{cents cash and the rest in securities.   Texas Air also would guarantee payment of the claims by year'send, regardless of Eastern's condition at the time, if thereorganization plan was not confirmed by Nov. 1, Lorenzo said.   Furthermore, Texas Air would cover one half of Eastern'sprojected losses through June 30, up to $40 million.   ``Texas air would be totally responsible for the feasibility ofthe corporation (Eastern),'' Lorenzo said.   The proposal was conditioned on bankruptcy court approval ofTexas Air's previously announced sale of 50 percent of its SystemOne computerized reservations system to Electronic Data SystemsCorp. for $250 million.   It also was conditioned on approval of Texas Air's payment of$280 million to Eastern to settle potential claims raised by areport by bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro. The reportsuggested Texas Air had underpaid by hundreds of millions ofdollars for Eastern and some of its assets.   In addition to the trustee request, Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.Lifland is considering Eastern's request for $80 million fromescrow to finance its operations during the second quarter.   Bakes said the money would be needed in the next week to 10days, although sources close to Texas Air have said the company iscommitted to covering Eastern's short-term expenses.   The creditors, who are owed about $980 million, claim Eastern'sinability to make viable business projections and halt itsfinancial losses indicates current management should be replaced.   But Bakes said putting a trustee in charge of Eastern would makeit tougher for the company to improve its performance, citingearlier Eastern testimony that such a move would shake theconfidence of consumers and travel agents in the airline.   ``I believe that there will be a much heightened risk of aliquidation of the company, whether intended or not...'' Bakes said.   Bakes also said many employees _ particularly in themaintenance, engineering and flight operations areas _ would quittheir jobs if a trustee was appointed.   Bakes conceded that Eastern had missed on many of its financialprojections, but said much of the airline industry experienced thesame uncertainty, especially in 1989.   ``There's been a lot of negotiations, a lot of discussions ...I'm not going to discuss it,'' Bakes told reporters earlierWednesday.   Sources have said Texas Air also has agreed to possibly removesome top managers in order to placate creditors.   But Houston-based Texas Air issued a statement labeling as``totally untrue'' rumors that Bakes' resignation had been offeredas a compromise to the creditors.   ``We have made no proposals to creditors which would involvePhil Bakes' replacement, nor is any such proposal planned,''Lorenzo said in the statement. ``Phil and his team have doneadmirably under very tough and trying circumstances.''   The committee representing unsecured creditors asked Texas Airseveral weeks ago to inject funds into Eastern. Texas Air's refusalhelped precipitate the creditors' request for Lifland to appoint atrustee.   Eastern has been reorganizing under bankruptcy court protectionsince shortly after a March 1989 strike by its Machinists, pilotsand flight attendants. The company has operated on a much smallerscale but has suffered from millions of dollars in business it lostand has had trouble regaining since the strike.   Bakes, who also is Eastern's chief executive officer, reviewedin his court testimony the labor strife and financial losses thatmarked his tenure.   Bakes took the job at Eastern in October 1986, after Texas Airacquired the carrier. Before that, he had been president ofEastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines, which reorganizedunder federal bankruptcy laws starting in 1982.   Bakes also said there is considerable debate within Eastern'sranks about the wisdom of the proposed sale of its prized SouthAmerican routes to rival American Airlines.   On Tuesday, one top Eastern official resigned, apparentlymotivated at least partly by the trustee issue. Eastern spokesmanRobin Matell said Tuesday that Jose Smith, the airline's seniorvice president of operations, had accepted a job at Coca-Cola Co.   Smith, who has worked for Eastern for 23 years, could not bereached for comment. But Bakes, asked by a reporter Wednesday aboutSmith's departure, said his decision ``has something to do withwhat is going on here, in this courtroom.''</TEXT></DOC>
