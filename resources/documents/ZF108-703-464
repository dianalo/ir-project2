 It turns out that Idid write something similar almost 10 years ago.andM;The opening line from my Brookings Institute staff paper -- &quot;Sometimes iswrong with federal government computer operations&quot; -- foreshadows Kelman'sopening salvo: &quot;The procurement system in the federal government is introuble.&quot;andM;I hope Kelman's book will have more impact than did my earlier study, whichserved only to deepen my appreciation of Henry Kaiser's summary of hisefforts to influence the auto industry: &quot;I expected to throw everything I hadinto the pond, but I didn't think it would disappear without a ripple.&quot;andM;Author Kelman, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School ofGovernment, throws a lot into his carefully researched and well-writtencritique of the federal governmenths information technology procurementprocess.andM;Far from being a dry and theoretical academic treatise, his analysis andrecommendations are bolstered by five case studies of recent majorprocurements, plus a survey of federal and private-sector managers.andM;Perhaps the most unsatisfactory feature of Professor Kelman's book is itsponderous title and subtitle, Procurement and Public Management: The Fear ofDiscretion and the Quality of Government Performance.andM;I suspect this grandiose descriptor was attached by the publisher, theAmerican Enterprise Institute.andP;  But the title masks the fact that this is awork specifically devoted to the problems of information technologyprocurement in the federal government.andM;In reviewing the goals of the procurement regulatory system, assuring equityand integrity in the bid process and getting the lowest price for thegovernment, Kelman finds a key goal missing -- that of achieving excellence.andO;&quot;The record,&quot; he writes, &quot;generally tends toward the mediocre andundistinguished rather than the catastrophic.&quot;andM;Criminal ClassandM;The rationale behind our procurement regulations is philosophically akin toMark Twain's view of politicians as being America's only native criminalclass.andM;&quot;The statutes, regulations and cultural norms that govern the procurementsystem reflect the view that, left to their own devices, government officialswill not live up to the ideals we hold.andP;  We fear that their contract awardswill be tainted by personal cronyism, partisan back scratching or outrightbribery....&quot;andP;  Kelman said.andM;&quot;In addition, government officials are suspected of being slothful andheedless.andP;  They fail to get good products at good prices, because they arenot spending their own money and there is no bottom line to worry about ingovernment,&quot; he said.andM;But regulations that seek to deprive selecting officials of discretion thatmight lead to misbehavior also deprive them of discretion that would callforth outstanding achievement.andM;Kelman draws upon his case studies to show instances of &quot;customer abuse&quot;engendered by the system -- &quot;taking advantage of foreseeabble errors,loopholes and ambiguities, or of foreseeable changes in circumstances, to thecustomer's detriment.&quot;andM;The opposite of customer abuse is &quot;customer coddling,&quot; a practice common inthe private sector but inhibited by government procurement rules.andP;  This means&quot;not holding the customer to the letter of his contractual commitments, andgoing beyond what the contract requires the vendor to do after circumstanceshave changed,&quot; he said.andM;Kelman may be overlay enamored of the state of customer-vendor relationshipsin the private sector.andM;But this chapter stressing the benefits of being able to consider a vendor'spast performance and site-specific knowledge in awarding future businessmakes some telling points.andM;The overriding theme is that government managers are robbed of discretion bythe system both in selecting and in dealing with their contractors.andM;Contracting officers are often a large part of the problem, he observes:&quot;These officials gain standing through their status as experts on the rules.andO;Since they lack any substantive responsibility for the missions furthered bythe products or services being acquired, they .andP;  .  .  fall victim to thenegative features of the procurement culture, which they present tounsuspecting technical or program people as if they were the law.&quot;andM;Experts on RulesandM;Anyone who has had to deal with a recalcitrant CO will attest to that.andP;  Buthow can we free government managers from what Kelman calls &quot;the tyranny ofthe proposal&quot;?andM;&quot;The basic principle, I believe, should be to increase dramatically thefreedom we give public officials to use their judgment in the procurementprocess,&quot; he writes.andP;  This can be done, Kelman concludes, by shifting fromrule-based to results-based acquisition.andM;&quot;I would urge statutory authorizations for experiments in eliminating mostprocurement rules in favor of a regim with only two broad proceduralrequirements -- written justification for each procurement decision andmultiple-member evaluation panels to reach decisions,&quot; he writes.andM;This must not result in arbitrary, exclusion of any vendor from governmentbusiness.andP;  &quot;Arbitrary exclusion is exclusion for no good reason, so if thereare good reasons not to choose a vendor, the exclusion is not arbitrary,&quot; heargues.andP;  &quot;I suggest only that public officials be given more room forjudgment in deciding not to give work to a vendor.&quot;andM;Investigate CorruptionandM;To safeguard such an informal system against abuse, Kelman advocates anincrease in investigate oversight and in criminal penalties for procurementcorruption.andP;  He notes that the Ill Wind procurement scandal was not uncoveredthrough operation of the rules apparatus but through the work of informantsand diligent investigators.andM;Most procurement fraud is associated with circumventing the rules to gaincompetitive advantage.andM;After reading Procurement and Public Management, I went back into my archivesto reread my Brookings monograph and found that I had cited as the paramountprocurement problem &quot;the overriding issue of how much leeway individualagency managers should have in acquiring hardware and software.&quot;andM;Aside from an increase in blanket delegations of procurement authority by theGeneral Services Administration, an action now being rethought, little haschanged in the regulatory framework within which information managers mustoperate.andP;  The time is overdue for serious consideration of reform along thelines suggested by Kelman.andM;As he said, &quot;We must be willing to pound over and over again the point thatthe current system represents an affront to our common sense.&quot;andM;Robert V.
