Included are all of the drillingand mapping data collected from field studies, and the subsequent generationof a geologic model for the coal field. The complex geologic structuresand the stratigraphic make-up of the area, including the nature and locationof coal seams within the Kushtaka formation were determined from thisinformation. These results helped the authors to calculate the reservequantity for the specific areas within the coal field that demonstratesome economic potential. The total resource potential for these combinedareas has been determined to be 59 million tons. A mineable reserve quantitycalculated at 60% recovery would be 35 million tons. The quality of coaland the possibility of long-range potential markets suggest that furtherresearch and exploration should be carried out, for a more precise evaluationof the resource potential of the Bering River coal field. 21 refs., 20figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
