(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   KaiserTech Ltd., the fifth-largestaluminum producer in the world, will be acquired by Maxxam GroupInc. for around $725 million.   KaiserTech announced Monday that it had agreed to be acquired bythe Los Angeles-based real estate and lumber company in a mergerthat would pay shareholders $19.375 in cash for each share ofKaiserTech common stock.   The agreement, under which KaiserTech would become a subsidiaryof Maxxam, was approved by KaiserTech's board of directors at aspecial meeting Sunday.   KaiserTech stock closed 25 cents lower Monday at $17.875 ashare. Maxxam stock closed unchanged at $13.875.   Industry analysts predicted that KaiserTech, which has lostmoney in recent years, should do well in 1988. The Oakland-basedcompany, which is the parent of Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical Corp.,is the third-largest aluminum producer in the nation.   ``KaiserTech made money in the first quarter, and we're lookingfor the first time in the last five or six years the company'sgoing to make money from its operations,'' said Sean St. Clair, ananalyst with Duff andamp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.   St. Clair also noted that aluminum prices have risen and thatU.S. producers are selling more both in the United States andabroad.   The two companies declined to comment on the future ofKaiserTech's current management and staff. But analyst Thomas VanLeeuwen of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York said thecompany's corporate structure probably would remain intact.   KaiserTech received one other bid from a private investmentgroup that proposed a leveraged buyout, but that company was notidentified. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances thepurchase of the target company with sales of the target's assets orfrom its cash flow.   KaiserTech shareholders will vote on the proposed merger at aspecial meeting to be called soon, the company said.   KaiserTech's lawyers believe that Delaware law, under whichKaiserTech is incorporated, requires an affirmative vote of atleast two-thirds of the shares of common stock not owned by Maxxamfor approval, company spokesman Robert W. Irelan said.   Earlier this year, Maxxam acquired 32 percent voting control ofKaiserTech's stock from KaiserTech Chairman Alan Clore for about$224 million, Maxxam spokesman Jim Iaco said.   Last month, KaiserTech sued Clore and Maxxam over a dispute overrights to nominate directors. But the two companies have agreed toask that the litigation be put on hold, Irelan said.   Maxxam, which develops real estate, also owns Pacific LumberCo., the world's largest producer of redwood lumber. It hasreceived widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting ofold-growth redwoods in Northern California.   KaiserTech operates plants in nine states and seven foreigncountries. It reported losses in five of the past six years, mainlybecause the recession of the early 1980s depressed aluminum prices,St. Clair said.   But the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices, which haddropped to 48 cents a pound, rose to $1.06 a pound, he said.   KaiserTech reported a net loss of $362 million last year,widened from a loss of $39.8 million in 1986. Revenues were about$2 billion in both years.   Much of the 1987 loss stemmed from the company's restructuringlast year, Irelan said.   But in the first quarter of 1988, KaiserTech reported net profitof $36.3 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $528.3million. For the same period in 1987, KaiserTech posted a net lossof $31.1 million on revenue of $494.2 million.</TEXT></DOC>
