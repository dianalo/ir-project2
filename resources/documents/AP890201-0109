Zvi Zamir, who headed Israel's Mossad from 1968 to 1974, wasformally named by Venice Magistrate Carlo Mastelloni, said Rome's IlMessaggero and other newspapers. The newspapers said Mossad wassuspected of seeking to punish Italy for what Israel consideredpro-Arab policies.   Although he was not officially charged, Zamir is beinginvestigated on suspicion of sabotaging the C-47 Dakota plane, thereports said.   The newspaper reports could not be confirmed independently. Themagistrate was not in his office when telephoned by The AssociatedPress.   The Israeli government today refused comment on the reportsconcerning Zamir, who is now in charge of Israel's oil refineries inHaifa.   However, the Israeli newspaper Hadashot quoted Avi Pazner,spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, as callingthe accusations against Zamir ``a bunch of speculation.''   Zamir was not immediately available today, but his wife said hewould have no comment on the report.   A few days before the Nov. 23, 1973 crash, the same militaryplane was used to transport several suspected Palestinian terroriststo Malta, the reports said. The Palestinians had been arrested atOstia outside Rome while allegedly planning to attack an Israeliairliner.   The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Marghera nearVenice, killing four Italian military officials.   A month ago, newspapers in Italy reported Mastelloni wasexamining a possible Israeli link to the crash. The reports said thehead of Mossad activities in Italy in 1973, time, identified as AbaLeven, was also suspected of involvement but that he died a fewyears ago.   The inquiry into the crash was reopened in 1986 after Italy'sformer head of military counter-espionage, Gen. Ambrogio Viviani,alleged in a magazine interview that Mossad had sabotaged the plane.</TEXT></DOC>
