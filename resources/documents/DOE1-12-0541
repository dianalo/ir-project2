<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0541 </DOCNO><TEXT>The angular distributions of the cross section {sigma}theta), vector analyzingpower A/sub y/, and tensor analyzing power A/sub yy/ were measured forthe {sup 1}H(anti d, {gamma}){sup 3}He and {sup 2}H(anti d, {gamma}){sup4}He reactions at E/sub d/ = 95 MeV. Our measurement of the {sup 2}H(antid, {gamma}){sup 4} reaction revealed that at E/sub d/ = 95 MeV therewere no significant changes from the reaction observed at E/sub d/ =10 MeV. The 90{sup 0} cross section is about 10% of the maximum crosssection. All of our results are consistent with the presence of E1 radiationin addition to the dominant E2 transition. A mechanism exists to giveE1 strength in this reaction, since the isospin selection rule suppressingthe E1 transition is rigorous only in the long wavelength limit. Ourmeasurement of the {sup 1}H(anti d, {gamma}){sup 3}He cross section wasin good agreement with other measurements of this process. The tensoranalyzing power was small and negative ({similar_to}-0.07). A simplePWBA model successfully fit this tensor analyzing power with the sameparameter set used to interpret A/sub yy/ at E/sub d/ = 30 MeV. Withinthe framework of this model, the asymptotic D-S state normalization ratiois eta = -0.029. This feature was unexpected, since the reaction mechanismchanges dramatically with energy (initial state interactions have diedout at E/sub d/ = 95 MeV).</TEXT></DOC>
