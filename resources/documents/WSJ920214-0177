Full, crisp, flowery, dry,   Oaky nose, fresh, they cry,   As they swirl, sniff, spit, pour out some more.   -- Lynda La Rocca.   ---   Flawed Romance                                                                                                          Making love is beautiful   When done in terms endearing,   But romance dies when it becomes   Genetic engineering.   -- Richard F.
