Wilson Goode said Thursday inaccepting the resignation. ``He has left his significant mark ofprofessionalism.''   When Tucker, 48, a former Secret Service agent who spent twodecades guarding government figures, took over the 6,700-memberforce in 1986, morale was poor and the department was held in lowesteem.   It was just seven months after the May 1985 confrontation withthe radical group MOVE in which police dropped a bomb that set fireto a neighborhood. Eleven people in the MOVE house died and 61homes were destroyed.   Morale also was suffering from the convictions of 34 officers,including a deputy commissioner, accused of taking bribes from vicefigures.   Tucker, the first outsider in more than 60 years to head thedepartment, took the post saying he would stay two to three years.   ``It was a high honor and privilege to serve the city,'' Tuckersaid Thursday. ``Our department has made progress. We have movedforward together. It has been a team effort with the officers, thecity and the public.''   Tucker said he wants to spend more time with his wife and twochildren, who live in nearby Medford Lakes, N.J. He said the city'sresidency requirements and the demands of the job allowed littletime with his family.   He has been occupying a downtown apartment because of a lawrequiring city residence for all employees. ``It personally tookits toll,'' he said.   Tucker denied speculation that a budget shortfall for fiscal1989 which might result in police layoffs played any role in hisresignation, which is effective June 10. Tucker has taken a jobwith a bank in Philadelphia.   The mayor said he would appoint a successor from within thedepartment. Among the leading candidates are the two deputycommissioners, Robert Armstrong and Willie Williams.   If appointed, Williams would be Philadelphia's first blackpolice commissioner.   Tucker, who was a police officer in Rahway, N.J., before joiningthe Secret Service in 1965, spent four years providing security forPresident Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline, and her two children. He wasagent in charge of the Philadelphia office before resigning in 1985for a job in private business.</TEXT></DOC>
