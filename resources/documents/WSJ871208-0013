Evidence of a Fed move remains sketchy, economists said, and Fed officials, as usual, wouldn't comment. But a small credit-tightening move would be consistent with a recent subtle change in U.S. policy toward placing more emphasis on bolstering the dollar.    The debate about the Fed intensified yesterday because the central bank refrained from intervening in the credit markets. That came as a surprise to many analysts who had expected the Fed to inject reserves into the banking system.    &quot;The Fed might be making a token, very small firming&quot; in short-term interest rates to support the dollar, said Peter Bass, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. &quot;It's too early to know yet, but the Fed has created some doubts.&quot;    Some short-term rates, such as those on three-month Treasury bills, jumped by about one-third of a percentage point yesterday. In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues fell sharply, with some 30-year bonds slumping by about a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury issue rose to 9.22% from 9 1/8% last Friday.    Nevertheless, stock prices rallied yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 45.43 points to 1812.17. The dollar rose against other major currencies.    The Fed and Reagan administration face a delicate task: how to defend the dollar without driving up interest rates so much that a recession occurs. In a Wall Street Journal story yesterday, U.S. officials discouraged the notion that increased support for the dollar would lead to any early rise in U.S. interest rates, and they stressed that the shift was one of degree and nuance, not a sharp change in course.    The need for higher U.S. rates to back the dollar was eased considerably last week when West Germany and other European nations reduced their rates. That increased the spread between American and European rates without requiring the kind of tighter U.S. monetary policy that the Fed and Reagan administration officials have been resisting since the stock market collapsed Oct. 19. Nevertheless, interest rates remain well below where they were before the crash. For example, 30-year Treasury bonds in mid-October yielded about 10 3/8%, or more than 1 1/8 percentage points from where they now stand.    Interpreting the Fed's policy intentions is more of an art than a science, and the subject often deteriorates into a tangled semantics debate. Even veteran Fed-watchers often disagree about how to define a credit-tightening move and whether the Fed has altered course. Whatever the case, numerous analysts yesterday argued that it is wrong to conclude that the Fed has changed policy at all.    &quot;I don't think the lack of the Fed activity was part of any change in policy,&quot; said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn., investment research firm. &quot;There certainly is a suspicion that the Fed was snugging&quot; credit, &quot;but I think that view probably is mistaken.&quot;    When the Fed intervenes in the credit markets, it usually does so shortly before noon New York time, known to bond traders as &quot;Fed time.&quot; Yesterday, many Fed-watchers had expected the Fed to inject reserves into the banking system by executing repurchase agreements on behalf of a customer, such as a foreign central bank. But nothing happened.    Meanwhile, the federal funds rate, which is watched closely as a barometer of Fed policy, remained uncomfortably high, adding to speculation that the Fed might have tightened its credit grip slightly. The funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, averaged 6.95% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from Friday's average of 6.82%.    But traders cautioned that it is difficult to draw conclusions about Fed policy based on federal funds rate changes. They noted that the funds rate often is especially volatile in December and that it frequently has surged late in the month purely for technical reasons. At one point on Dec. 31 of last year, the funds rate soared to 38%. And it hit 40% at one point on Dec. 31, 1985.    &quot;Memories of the debacles that have closed out the past two years are still vivid and have already led to aggressive bidding for funds over the year-end period,&quot; according to The Money Market Observer, a publication by R.H. Wrightson andamp; Associates Inc. It said several special factors contributed to the surge during those years and that that those factors should be absent this year.    A higher funds rate still appears likely later this month, although analysts expect less of an increase than in the previous two years. &quot;We think the effective Fed funds rate on Dec. 31 is likely to rise only to 8% or 9% -- a bargain by recent year-end standards,&quot; the Wrightson publication said.    Although analysts disagreed on whether the Fed has changed strategy, most agreed that the debate played a significant role in the bond price slump. They noted that the central bank in the past occasionally has used the tactic of non-intervention to signal a new direction in credit policy. In short, no news from the Fed can sometimes be big news.    &quot;We respectfully decline to comment&quot; on whether the Fed has altered policy, said Bart Sotnick, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. &quot;We won't talk about current policy.&quot;    The latest 30-year Treasury bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of 96 15/32, down from 97 12/32 Friday. The latest 10-year Treasury notes fell to 98 26/32 from 99 12/32, while their yield increased to 9.05% from 8.97%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 10.11 points to 1223.09. It ranged between 1221.38 and 1231.80.    Uncertainty about the Fed attracted especially close attention yesterday because of the absence of any other major developments, traders said. Trading volume was very light. &quot;Decemberitis,&quot; one trader put it.    &quot;We're already in a holiday mode,&quot; said Mr. Bass of S.G. Warburg. &quot;People just want 1987 to be over.&quot;    Despite the bond market's weakness, a $200 million issue of Detroit Edison Co. bonds was offered to investors yesterday. The 9 7/8% bonds, due June 15, 1993, were priced at par, which means their full face amount. The yield on the bonds was about 1 3/8 points above comparable Treasury notes.    The Treasury sold new short-term bills yesterday at sharply higher rates than at last week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills climbed to 5.81% from 5.49% a week ago. The average rate on new 26-week bills rose to 6.42% from 6.12%.    Here are details of the Treasury bill auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                              13-Week            26-Week Applications .......... $20,421,920,000    $17,905,170,000 Accepted bids .......... $6,411,420,000     $6,413,670,000 Accepted at low price ............. 20%                42% Accepted noncompet'ly .... $896,675,000       $744,865,000 Average price (Rate) .... 98.531(5.81%)      96.754(6.42%) High price (Rate) ....... 98.559(5.70%)      96.815(6.30%) Low price (Rate) ........ 98.521(5.85%)      96.739(6.45%) Coupon equivalent ............... 6.00%              6.75%   Both issues are dated Dec. 10 .
