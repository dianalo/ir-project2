In these models the rank is naturally lowereddue to the presence of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term associated with an 'anomalous'U(1) in the four-dimensional theory. It is shown that the phenomenologicalviability of the models selects a favoured class of vacua. In particular,for the specific examples considered, some twisted fields with one modedoscillator acting, must acquire non-vanishing VEVs. However other possibilitiesmay exist. We also find that all the baryon and lepton violating operatorscan be, in general, avoided in a completely natural way.</TEXT></DOC>
