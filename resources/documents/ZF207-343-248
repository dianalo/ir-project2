Hager, chief of theSCS Software and Database Branch, discussed plans to use a commercialmethodology to develop and support the programs required to carry out theagency's mission.andM;Though USDA issued its own directives on software life cycle management lastyear, SCS already had purchased the Structured Analyst, Design andImplementation of Information Systems (STRADIS) methodology from McDonnellDouglas in 1987.andM;Yet the STRADIS methodology matches up well with USDA's Application SystemsLife Cycle Management approach, said Joan Ledbetter, the software managementprogram director in USDA's Office of Information Resources Management.andM;&quot;STRADIS fits very well into what we put out as policy.andP;  We worked hard tomake our methodology flexible.andP;  The bottom line is we want good systemsdeveloped,&quot; Ledbetter said.andM;As of March, SCS policy will require all new nationally funded software aredatabase projects to use the STRADIS methodology, and existing projects willbe converted when feasible, Hager said.andM;In January 1988, SCS's Field Office Engineering Software project became theagency's first to use the STRADIS methodology, Hager said.andP;  &quot;This was afairly large project that had a lot of visibility in the agency, and theyvolunteered to use the methodology.andP;  These engineers were used to doingthings in a specific fashion, which fit in well with this methodology.andM;&quot;They were willing volunteers and we took advantage of that.andP;  The downside isthat it is a large project and it's not something that's turning aroundthrough the life cycle very quickly,&quot; he said.andM;In addition, all four software development projects the SCS IRM Review Boardapproved for fiscal year 1989 must use the STRADIS methodology, Hager said.andM;SCS has 25 national database projects, of which only two are required tofollow the software life cycle management approach because they exceed $10million, he said.andP;  However, seven new and existing projects will employSTRADIS, he said.andM;STRADIS VarianceandM;While at least one agency project employed the STRADIS methodology for morethan a year, its &quot;benefits have been piecemeal,&quot; Hager said.andP;  &quot;We reallycan't tell how beneficial it will be until more projects begin to use it.&quot;andM;One benefit has been that STRADIS has forced integration of concepts and dataelements at an early stage, Hager said.andP;  Before using STRADIS, SCS did nothave any software development directives, but the methodology has enabled theagency to put some in place as well as to develop a software developmenthandbook, he said.andM;About two years ago, SCS decided to go with a life cycle managementmethodology because of its need for &quot;a standard approach to softwaredevelopment to coordinate and integrate subsystems associated with nationalsoftware priorities,&quot; Hager said.andP;  In addition, the majority of the SCSsoftware development project managers had little or no prior experience onsoftware development projects, Hager said.andP;  The agency needed a definitivelife cycle management methodology, he said.andM;During the summer of 1987, SCS evaluated several leading system developmentmethodologies.andP;  At that time USDA had only a draft set of software managementmanuals for the application systems life cycle, which was under review beforedistribution throughout the department.andP;  &quot;We used that as our primarycriteria for adopting a specific methodology,&quot; Hager said.andM;Meanwhile, SCS had been using computer-aided software engineering tools, suchas Excelerator from Index Technology Corp., Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;So we had someof our field offices' and state offices' automation areas identified to acertain extent in terms of data flow diagrams and data dictionaryinformation,&quot; Hager said.andM;Thus the SCS methodology had to support all the tools and techniques theagency had been using.andP;  &quot;We really didn't want to make any drastic change inimplementing a methodology because we thought there were methodologies in themarketplace that could support what we currently were using,&quot; he said.andM;In addition, the methodology had to have training courses available for bothSCS project managers and technical staff, Hager said.andP;  It also would have toidentify explicitly all the procedures to be followed and have reviews builtinto the life cycle.andM;In September 1987, SCS spent $36,900 -- GSA schedule price -- for adepartmental license to use STRADIS.andP;  &quot;It's not software, but a proprietarymethodology that McDonnell Douglas supports.andP;  We did not obtain the licensejust for SCS, but for all of USDA,&quot; Hager said.andM;Other USDA agencies that wish to use the methodology need order only thedocuments and reference library from McDonnell Douglas by referencing the SCSlicense, Hager said.andP;  The methodology manuals cost $100 a set, he said.andM;The STRADIS documentation consists of seven volumes: Fundamentals, ProjectManagement, Strategic Planning, Application Life Cycle, Sample Projects,Structured Techniques I and Structured Techniques II.andP;  SCS uses every segmentbut the strategic plan, Hager said.andM;Last June, the SCS IRM Management Improvement Plan recommended that SCSestablish and adhere to a policy requiring a total project managementprocess, such as STRADIS, be used for all national software and databaseinitiatives.andP;  The plan also recommended that extensive training in structuredsystems analysis and STRADIS be required for all who will undertake softwaredevelopment, Hager said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
