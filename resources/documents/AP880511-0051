The report has been withheld from Congress, however, and thecopies of the report have been made available only throughunofficial channels, say aides to Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.   Miller is chairman of the House Interior water and powerresources subcommittee considering the administration request toallow oil rigs in the nation's largest wildlife refuge.   In April 1987, Miller had requested a report from the Fish andWildlife Service on the environmental impact of drilling inAlaska's North Slope.   Miller's aides said Tuesday the report prepared by the service'sFairbanks office was completed and sent to the Interior Departmentlast December but never sent to Miller.   Philip Million, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service,said Tuesday night he had not seen the report, but said he had beentold ``that it was a regional report prepared in Alaska and therewere disagreements within the regional office on the conclusionsreached in that report.''   Million said the report either has been or is being modified,but that he didn't know what conclusions the final version willdraw.   The report deals with existing drilling activities at PrudhoeBay, about 70 miles west of the refuge, and the Trans-Alaskapipeline.   The information from the report did not represent any ``smokinggun'' that could, by itself, torpedo the administration's requestfor permission to drill in the refuge, the aide said.   ``What makes this such a big deal is they sat on it,'' said theaide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.   Another aide commented: ``The real issue is whether Congress isbeing told the whole story. They're not.''   The new report by the Fairbanks office supports some testimonygiven to Congress that populations of predators like bears andwolves have diminished since Prudhoe opened. The decline has beenblamed on the arrival of an industrial complex and illegal hunting.   But the document also said the caribou herd in the area hasgrown during development of Prudhoe and that no major oil spillshad occurred.   The report said air pollution has been a problem at Prudhoe, butsaid that dust has been more of a problem than chemical pollutants,the Miller aides said.   They added that the report cited pollution of fresh waterbecause of drilling operations and alterations in natural freshwater flows because of construction.   In testimony before congressional committees considering thefuture of the refuge, Interior Department witnesses haveacknowledged problems at Prudhoe with environmental protection andenforcement but they said Prudhoe has improved in recent years andthose lessons would be applied to any drilling in the refuge.   Miller's aides related that another section of the report said22,500 birds were lost or displaced from Prudhoe.   The aides noted, however, that the report did not tell anotherside of the Prudhoe story: It has produced 5 billion barrels of oiland brought about $100 billion worth of economic benefits to thenation.   Miller's subcommittee has tentatively scheduled another round ofhearings on the refuge question for early next month. Bills to openthe refuge have been approved by the House Merchant Marine andFisheries Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural ResourcesCommittee.   The Reagan administration and the oil industry have been pushingCongress since the start of 1987 to allow development on therefuge, which they say may hold oil deposits to rival Prudhoe Bay'sand which could help alleviate the nation's growing dependence onimported oil.</TEXT></DOC>
