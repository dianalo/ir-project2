By scaling genericissues to different repositories, it is shown that a two vehicle automatedwaste emplacement/retrieval system can be designed to operate in a fail-safemode. Evaluation of cost at this time is not possible. Significant gainsin worker safety, however, can be realized by minimizing the possibilityof human exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
