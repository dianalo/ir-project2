The suit alleges that company executives failed to disclose that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in allowing the thrift to add $115 million of 20-year subordinated capital notes to its regulatory net worth in February 1986, had required it to reduce certain other investments to below 10% of assets.    An attorney for the plaintiffs said Western Savings failed to meet the Bank Board's request by a June 1987 deadline, &quot;and didn't report that they were in violation of these conditions.&quot; He added that &quot;a lot of the investments were questionable, or beyond the magnitude of risk the Bank Board wanted them to be involved in.&quot;    The suit seeks unspecified damages.    The thrift said, &quot;We have reviewed the complaint and fully expect to be successful in the defense of this litigation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
