The amendment would renew Possession-Only License No. DPR-9 to extendthe expiration date of the license from June 30, 1985 to March 20, 2025.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Proposed Action </ITAG>Fermi 1 has been shut down since September 22, 1972 and all fuel has beenremoved from the site. The licensee intends to retain Fermi 1 in a safestorage (SAFSTOR) status until after the Fermi 2 license expires on March20, 2025, at which time the residual radioactivity will be removed fromUnit 1 to levels acceptable for release of the facility to unrestrictedaccess. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impacts </ITAG>Fermi 1 is now maintained in a shutdown status in accordance with the TechnicalSpecifications and ALARA requirements of 10 CFR Part 20. The residual radioactivity(477 curies) at Fermi 1 will decay significantly in the 40-year periodof the proposed license renewal. There is very little potential for a releaseof radioactivity to the environment or a significant radiation exposureof workers because more than 95 percent of the residual radioactivity remainsas activated metal components that are sealed within the reactor vesselwhich is in turn surrounded by a metal containment building. The 40-year delay in removal of residual radioactivity will reduce potentialexposure rates to workers that would dismantle Fermi 1 by a factor of about100. In addition, the 40-year delay will result in a smaller volume ofradioactive waste to be disposed of at the time of decontamination as comparedto immediate decontamination. The smaller volume of radioactive waste willresult in the use of a smaller area at a waste burial facility. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the proposed renewal of the Fermi 1 facility licenserelative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based upon theenvironmental assessment, the staff concluded that there are no significantenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed action and that theproposed license amendment will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment. Therefore, the Commission had determined, pursuantto 10 CFR 51.31, not to prepare an environmental impact statement for theproposed amendment. For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applicationfor amendment dated May 17, 1985 as supplemented by letters dated July23, 1986, September 15, 1986, September 25, 1987, September 15, 1988 andDecember 22, 1988 and (2) the Environmental Assessment.
