<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0282 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fuel control apparatus for a fuel injection system of an internal combustionengine having at least one fuel injector for supplying fuel to correspondingcylinders of the engine is described comprising: air flow sensing meansfor sensing a rate of air flowing into an air intake pipe of the engineand producing an electrical output signal having a frequency proportionalto the air flow rate; crank angle sensing means for producing an electricaloutput pulse each time a crankshaft of the engine is at a prescribedcrank angle; frequency division means for producing an output havinga frequency which is one-half the output signal frequency of the airflow sensing means by performing frequency division of the output signalof the air flow sensing means when engine load exceeds a prescribed valueand for producing an output having the same frequency as the output signalof the air flow sensing means when engine load is below the prescribedvalue; and control means for determining an actual rate of air flowinginto the cylinders of the engine based on the output of the frequencydivision means and the output pulse of the crank angle sensing meansand for controlling the fuel injector based on the previously determinedair flow rate.</TEXT></DOC>
