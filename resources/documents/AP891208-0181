The decision, on the opening day of a two-day summit, means theEC will convene a special conference in December 1990 to startnegotiations for the adoption of a single currency and to set up asystem of central banks.   The agreement came after France and West Germany overrodeobjections by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that radicalmonetary integration will rob member countries of sovereign rightsto decide national economic policy.   In another blow to Mrs. Thatcher, the leaders agreed _ with heralone dissenting _ to adopt a non-binding ``social charter''setting out community-wide rights for labor unions, wages andwelfare.   Over dinner, the leaders considered a draft politicaldeclaration that called for ``intensified'' political dialogue andcooperation with the Soviet Union and other reform-minded nationsof Eastern Europe.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, West German sources said,also hoped to insert a clause expressing support for Germanreunification.   But French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas reported severaldelegations rejected the German phrasing.   He said the French proposed different phrasing, calling forreinforcement of peace in Europe that would lead to Germany``recovering its unity.'' The political declaration states thatrecovery must be carried out ``democratically and peacefully,''Dumas said.   The final declaration, due to be issued Saturday, was expectedto reaffirm the present borders of East and West Germany.   Concern has been expressed about the Oder-Neisse border betweenEast Germany and Poland and a reunified Germany's possible claim toparts of Poland populated by ethnic Germans.   The leaders also gave their backing to a French proposal tocreate a European Development Bank to help the economies ofemerging democracies in Eastern Europe, but left the details to beworked out.   The deal on the monetary union conference was sealed after Kohlbowed to pressure by the summit host, French President FrancoisMitterrand, to fix December 1990 as the launch date.   Kohl had hoped to delay the conference start until early 1991,after West German elections scheduled on Dec. 9, 1990.   Abolishing West Germany's strong mark currency is an electorallysensitive subject.   The inter-governmental conference on monetary union will markthe start of what are likely to be several years of negotiations tomake necessary amendments to the EC's 1957 founding treaty.   Britain will attend the conference in what Thatcher aidesdescribed as a ``spirit of constructive argument.''   Treaty changes require unanimity and Britain can veto any finalmove to abolish national currencies or set up the single centralbank system.   Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers said the agreement to hold theconference was ``politically very important.''   ``It puts pressure on the member states _ this (monetaryintegration) is a tall order,'' said Lubbers.   Mitterrand had sought a dramatic move toward greater unity atthe summit in this city on the French-German border.   He argues that Western nations must move closer to form a strongand stable force that can reach out to encourage and help theemerging democracies of Eastern Europe.   ``It is important for France,'' a French source said of thedecision to fix a date for the monetary conference. ``Because weknow it is with precise dates that we advance.''   No formal votes were taken Friday, and only Mrs. Thatcherobjected during the closed-door discussions on the monetaryconference and the social charter.   She says the charter will increase unemployment, raise costs andmake EC goods less competitive.   During a pause after the monetary union decision, the conventioncenter, including the room where the leaders were meeting, wasblacked out in a five-minute power cut.   Mrs. Thatcher had hoped to focus discussion in Strasbourg on thepractical agenda of completing the single barrier-free market whichthe Community is due to become at the end of 1992, and on the EC'sresponse to events in Eastern Europe.   Lubbers said the summit would culminate in sending ``a messageof encouragement to those people (in Eastern Europe) who are thedriving forces of reform ... it is a revolution without violence.You must encourage that.''</TEXT></DOC>
