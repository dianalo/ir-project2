In analogy with the definition of the task of process engineering- i.e. transformation of materials on an industrial scale - the purposeof energy process engineering can be delineated as the treatment of materialswhich find application or occur in energy conversion, whether as energysources, as intermediates, or as undesired waste or ballast materials.After surveying the possible variety of the tasks of energy process engineering,the article briefly discusses the present state of the art with the aidof selected examples. An attempt is then made to introduce some kindof system into this wide-ranging material. In view of current activities,it appears appropriate to first concentrate on the treatment of residualmaterials - waste and ballast - in various methods of energy conversion.</TEXT></DOC>
