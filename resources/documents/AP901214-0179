Albanian radio confirmed the unrest in Elbasan, about 18 milessoutheast of the capital Tirana. It said said six security forcemembers were injured by stones and two had to be hospitalized. Italso reported much damage on Thursday during seven hours ofvandalism and looting in the northern city of Shkodra.   An editor of the Albanian ATA news agency said Elbasan, a cityof about 80,000 residents with a giant steel mill, was quiet Fridaynight after soldiers and security forces moved in.   Albanian media reported that 10 people were hurt and 30 arrestedin Thursday's violence in Shkodra.   Albanian radio, monitored in London, also said an attempt wasmade Friday to gather in the main square of the central coastalcity of Durres, but security forces intervened and dispersed``these malevolent elements.''   The two days of riots followed government concessions thatallowed formation of Albania's first non-Communist party. The smallBalkan nation south of Yugoslavia is ruled by the last Stalinistregime remaining in Europe.   Journalists and intellectuals had said Communist President RamizAlia was meeting with leaders of the Democratic Party of Albania,formed on Wednesday, as both sides appealed for calm and a halt tounrest in provincial cities.   But an intellectual said later the meeting never took place. Hesaid he talked with others who had wanted to participate, andindicated the explanation by authorities was that no meeting wasneeded because ``All that must be done and said has been done andsaid. No more words. Now we must work.''   Alia decided this week to allow alternative parties. Popularuprisings last year toppled the other Communist governments inEastern Europe, Alia appeared to be trying to avoid an explosion ofpopular discontent over living conditions and decades of Communistrepression.   But on Friday, the angry crowd in Elbasan stoned officialbuildings, ``broke windows, looted food shops, set fire todifferent shops, cars and machinery,'' said the ATA journalist, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   ``They destroyed everything in their way,'' he said, indicatingthat local police failed to stop the crowd.   The official Tanjug news agency in neighboring Yugoslavia saidfootage shown on Albanian TV ``showed fire and police vehicles withwater cannon on fire, turned-over police cars, smashed andvandalized store windows.'' It did not say where the footage wastaken.   Other footage identified as being shot in Shkodra showed armoredvehicles guarding the local radio and Communist Party buildings,Tanjug said.   Tanjug said Albanian Justice Minister Enver Halili appeared onTV and said that democracy and socialism were in danger in Albania.   The intellectual in Tirana, contacted by telephone from Vienna,expressed concern that the violence ``is commanded by a hiddenhand. Who this is, I cannot grasp.''   Asked if he thought the violence might endanger what has beenachieved in Tirana, he said: ``Exactly. It is done only for this,to get the new events, the new freedom into difficulty.''   An intellectual in Tirana said peaceful protests took placeThursday in the southern town of Saranda on the Adriatic coast.   The intellectual, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidcrowds in Tirana had gathered outside the Palace of Congresses onFriday evening in anticipation of the meeting between the presidentand the new party. When the party was formed, tens of thousands ofpeople cheered party leaders at a peaceful rally.   The opposition had been expected to present its platform foreconomic reforms and adherence to international human rightsguidelines.   On Wednesday, Alia appealed on nationwide TV and radio forpeaceful change in Albania, which has been under rigid Communistrule since 1944.   His decision to allow alternative political movements may havetouched off resistance among conservative elements of the rulingCommunists and the Sigurimi, the secret police.   Alia also fired five hard-line members of his ruling Politburo.   Police and troops moved into Shkodra on Thursday to deal withhundreds of ``hooligans'' who attacked officials and buildings,wounding the local police chief and two other officers, officialreports said.   Persistent reports this year, many from Yugoslavia and Greece,spoke of unrest in Shkodra and other northern areas thattraditionally were Roman Catholic before the Communists took over.   Reports also surfaced of unrest in southern Albania, home to anestimated 40,000 ethnic Greeks.   Official newspapers carried a statement Friday from the newparty condemning the Shkodra violence. It was also read on state byone of the party's leaders, Arben Imame.</TEXT></DOC>
