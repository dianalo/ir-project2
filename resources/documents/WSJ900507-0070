The change in sentiment, which was evident after theDepartment of Labor released the April employment reportFriday, also means that some interest rates may not exceedcurrent levels.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's kind of crazy to think that one report can createwild swings&quot; in investor sentiment and interest-rateexpectations, said William Brachfeld, manager of governmenttrading at Daiwa Securities Inc. But that's exactly whathappened.   And crazy or not, the mood swing is likely to help UncleSam easily auction $10.5 billion of three-year notestomorrow. The two other auctions, $10 billion of 10-yearnotes Wednesday and $10 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday,should also run smoothly.   Just a few days ago, sentiment in the bond market was sougly that traders were bracing for big trouble at theauction.   They worried that the Federal Reserve would soon jack upinterest rates in an effort to squash inflation. They warnedthat yields on the new Treasury securities would have toexceed 9% to lure buyers to the record bond sale. They saidthe government's bond auction could be a fiasco becauseinstitutional investors, who have seen the value of theirfixed-income portfolios plummet this year, didn't want anymore bonds. Sure, small investors were expected to buy bondsat the auction because of attractive yields, but theirpurchases wouldn't be large enough to ensure the auction'ssuccess, the traders said.   While traders' nightmares could still come true, manyeconomists believe such concerns are overblown.   The reason: Friday's employment report, which suggestedthat the economy is much weaker than previous economicreports may have indicated. The Labor Department reportedthat nonfarm jobs grew by just 64,000 in April. Excluding the78,000 increase in employment related to temporary censusworkers, the April total would actually have declined by14,000 last month.   The Labor Department also reported that average hourlyearnings rose three cents to $9.95 in April on an adjustedbasis, a sign that labor-cost inflation is well undercontrol.   The jobs report was widely viewed as a sign that the spikeup in interest rates may be ending. Moreover, economists nowbelieve that the Federal Reserve will vote to keep interestrates unchanged at its May 15 meeting of the Federal OpenMarket Committee. Prior to the employment report, there wasconcern that the Fed would raise rates because other recenteconomic reports have suggested that the economy was pickingup and inflation accelerating.   The employment report &quot;reduced the market's fear that theFed has to tighten credit policy,&quot; said Brian Fabbri, aneconomist at Midland Montagu Securities.   Immediately after the data were released, Treasury bondprices soared and yields eased to the lowest levels in weeks.The benchmark 30-year bond jumped more than 1 1/2 points, or$15 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, while the yieldfell to 8.8%. Two days earlier, the yield had been more than9%.   Although yields could rise slightly ahead of the auction,&quot;my guess is that it will be difficult to push the bond backover 9%, since sentiment has been bolted,&quot; said Mr. Fabbri.He expects yields on new Treasury securities to average 87/8%, which he says is attractive enough to lure investors.   Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities Corp., is urging clients to buy bonds.&quot;We believe that inflation in the U.S. will be contained at4.5%-5%. In this context, 30-year Treasury obligations atroughly 8.8% are offering at least a 3.8% real yield. Weregard that as an extraordinarily high yield for long-termTreasury obligations.&quot;   Dealers are more uncertain about the level of Japaneseparticipation at the auction. Tokyo markets were closed mostof last week for holidays, so there won't be a goodindication of Japanese demand until today.   Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chiefeconomist at DKB Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Japan'sDai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said that Japanese investors shouldparticipate sizably.   &quot;Japanese insurance companies have reportedly decided tohold the percent of their dollar assets to total assetsstable this fiscal year, implying investment of their premiumincome in U.S. Treasurys in the same proportion to theircurrent dollar asset holdings. This suggests a takedown ofsome 30% or so of the Treasury refunding,&quot; said Mr.Braverman. Moreover, Japan's Ministry of Finance and the Bankof Japan have encouraged Japanese institutions to put in a&quot;good showing&quot; at the auction, according to Mr. Braverman.   Thomas Sowanick, senior fixed-income strategist at MerrillLynch andamp; Co., believes that Japanese participation could be &quot;apleasant surprise.&quot; He notes that yields on 10-year Treasurynotes are 1.65 percentage points higher than yields on10-year Japanese government securities. That is up fromMarch, when the yield-spread was less than 1.20 percentagepoints. He says that Japanese investors are flush with cash,largely from recent bond redemptions. &quot;The combination ofavailable cash, wider spreads and a stable dollar suggeststhat the foreign-sector bid {at the auction} could in fact belarger than the market is expecting,&quot; Mr. Sowanick said.   Mr. Brachfeld also expects Japanese investors to show upin large numbers at the auction, but he isn't sure whetherthat will have a lasting positive impact on the bond marketafter the auction. The question, he said, is whether the bulkof Japanese buyers will be speculators or long-terminvestors. While buying by long-term investors could help themarket, speculators may simply buy bonds at the auction andturn around and dump the securities in the days and weeksfollowing the auction.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The employment report triggered an explosive rally in thebond market.   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose more than 1 1/2points, or $15 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Theprice was quoted late Friday at 96 19/32 to yield 8.81%, upfrom 95 1/32 to yield 8.97% on Thursday.   The yield on the benchmark bond, which recently rose above9% for the first time in nearly a year, edged down to itslowest level in more than two weeks.   Yields on shorter-term securities fell even faster.Two-year Treasury notes, which were quoted late in the day ata price of 100 9/32, compared with 99 27/32 on Thursday, wereyielding 8.698% on Friday, compared with 8.926% on Thursday.   In the corporate bond market, investment-grade bondsfollowed the Treasury market. Most issues ended about 1/2point higher.   Junk bonds however, were little changed. Junk bonds arehigh-yield, speculative-graded corporate bonds that have lowcredit ratings or no credit ratings at all.   Among Friday's major market movers were the junk bonds ofGreyhound Lines Inc., which sank on news that the strikeboundcarrier won't make a semiannual interest payment on itspublicly traded 13% senior notes due May 15. In addition, thebus company said it had a loss of $55.7 million during thefirst quarter, sharply wider than a $14.4 million loss duringthe same period a year ago.   Prices of Greyhound's 13% senior notes due in 1995 slidsix points to a bid price of 42. However, dealers said thatvery few bonds actually traded hands.   Traders said that activity in the junk bond market wasextremely quiet on Friday, partly because many marketparticipants were attending Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s high-yieldconference in Phoenix, Ariz.   Meanwhile, First Boston Corp. said its junk bond indexproduced a positive 0.42% return during the month of April.First Boston also reported that buy-backs of junk bond debthit record levels in the first quarter. The firm said thatabout $1.5 billion of junk bonds was bought back by issuersduring the first quarter, and another $1 billion inhigh-yield debt was retired.   Ever since the junk bond market went into a tailspin lastSeptember, companies such as Mark IV Industries Inc.,Burlington Holdings Inc. and Colt Industries Inc. have beenin the market buying back their debt at discounts.   &quot;The market prices that we have now are such that the bestinvestment companies can make is to buy back their debt atthese levels,&quot; said Kingman Penniman, senior vice presidentat McCarthy Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc. &quot;I think as we startlooking at the numbers, and we start seeing the 10-Qs comingin, we are going to see continued repurchases of debt.&quot; A10-Q is a filing a company makes with the Securities andExchange Commission that gives details of earnings andrelated financial information.</TEXT></DOC>
