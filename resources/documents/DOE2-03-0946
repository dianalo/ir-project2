The facilities and capabilities of this program are now beingmade more generally available to the roofing industry through designationof the Roof Research Center (RRC) as a National Users Facility. Withinthis program, DOE will actively seek multiple sponsorship for projects.It is the purpose of this marketing plan to define a strategy to assurethat sufficient outside funding will be attracted to the RRC. Currentliterature on the roofing industry, existing market research and interviewswith industry experts were used to gain information needed in this report.Industry trends, historical research expenditures, product classes andmanufacturers in the industry were identified. From this, a list of targetfirms for the RRC was devised, along with the major publicity influencesof this market. The RRC was also analyzed to determine its objectivesand capabilities. Opportunities and problems that might occur with outsideindustry funding were also identified so that these could be addressedin the marketing strategy. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
