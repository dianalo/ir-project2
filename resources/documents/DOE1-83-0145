Between 1270{sup 0} and 1180 {sup 0}C olivine and minor spinelare the only liquidus phases, and the melt volume decreases from 85 to74 vol %. At the ol-sp-pc-cpx cotectic, melt is consumed more rapidlydropping to 47 vol % at 1139 {sup 0}C. The rheology of the magma is non-Newtonian,is characterized by time-dependent, pseudoplastic behavior, and is consistentwith power law flow or Bingham pseudoplastic behavior. Non-newtonianeffects are most apparent when the crystal volume is greater than 25%and the shear rate is increasing. Once stirred, the magma approachesNewtonian rheology with decreasing shear rate. At 1170 {sup 0}C (approximately25% suspended crystals) the apparent activation energy (calculated atunit shear rate) increases from 123 +- 10 kcal mol{sup -1} to 452 +-21 kcal mol{sup -1}. When the change in liquid composition along theliquidus is included, the observed viscosities are in good agreementwith those calculated from the Einstein-Roscoe equation for a serialsize distribution of crystals. A quadratic fit to the shear stress-strainrate data yields a nonzero intercept indicative of a finite yield strength.The apparent yield strength increases with decreasing temperature reaching{approx_equal}800 Pa at 1149 {sup 0}C. These extrapolated (and modeldependent) values are in good agreement with those determined by othermethods (Shaw et al., 1968; McBirney and Murase, 1984).</TEXT></DOC>
