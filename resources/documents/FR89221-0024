This proposed rule would not resultin an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State or local government agencies, or geographical regions; or have significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreignbased enterprises in domestic or export markets. Under the proposal, industrywould have analytically defined requirements for each type of turkey hamproduct they wanted to make. it would reduce the potential for arbitrarylabeling practices, since product designation would be based on a verifiablelaboratory analysis. The new sampling system would also reduce samplingcost. Consumers would benefit from improved assurance that turkey ham productsare accurately labeled and in compliance with the Agency's standards forthese products. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities </ITAG>The Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, has determined thatthis action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act,Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C. 601). The Agency is aware of approximately 34poultry establishments producing turkey ham products. Of the 34 establishments,only 3 are considered to be small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this action.Written comments should be sent to the Policy Office and should bear referenceto the docket number located in the heading of this document. Any persondesiring an opportunity for an oral presentation of views, as providedfor in the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 <T3>et seq.</T3>), must make such request to Mr. Clemons so that arrangementscan be made for such views to be presented. A record will be made of allviews orally presented. All comments submitted pursuant to this actionwill be available for public inspection in the Policy Office between 9:00a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On March 15, 1983, the National Turkey Federation (NTF) petitioned theFood Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to establish PFF values for turkeyham. This petition was received during the comment period on the proposalfor PFF in cured pork products (47 FR 50900). NTF believes that such actionwould promote product standardization and permit turkey ham producers tocompete more equitably with pork ham producers. The petitioner requestedthat PFF standards be developed for the following categories:<ITAG tagnum="14">1. Turkey Ham </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">2. Turkey Ham_Natural Juices </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3. Turkey Ham_Water Added </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">4. Turkey Ham_Percent Water Added </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">5. Turkey Ham_Chopped.</ITAG>NTF asserted the existence of increasing concern within the turkey processingindustry that some processors were not complying with standards as setforth in the regulations. As a result, it has been alleged that some turkeyham contains excess moisture. By establishing PFF for turkey ham, FSISwould provide, according to NTF, a better method of control over waterand other substances added to turkey ham products. The proposal which elicited the NTF petition, was published as a finalrule on April 13, 1984, and became effective April 15, 1985 (49 FR 14856).It modernized the Agency's regulatory program to ensure that cured porkproducts are accurately labeled at all stages of commerce. Previous standardslimiting the amount of added water and other substances were replaced withstandards specifying a minimum meat protein content on a fat free basis(PFF) in the various finished cured pork products. The rule also set forthcompliance procedures to assure conformance with the standards and providesrelabeling and/or processing requirements for products not in conformancewith such standards. The PFF approach eliminates the difficulty of monitoringand enforcing standards based on added substances. It also provides forthe production and marketing of a wider range of products than previouslyallowed under the regulations. NTF is requesting that a similar controlsystem be established for turkey ham products. PFF means the percentage of meat protein in the nonfat portion of the finishedproduct. The PFF approach reflects the presence of all added ingredientsand relates labeling claims to the percent of meat protein in the producton a fat free basis. PFF allows control of added ingredients by controllingthe meat protein in the nonfat portion of the cured product because anythingadded to the product dilutes the natural protein content. PFF is derived from laboratory analyses for protein and fat. The formulaused to determine PFF of cured products is: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,4,1,32,5</C>  <H1>PFF</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Percent Meat Protein by Analysis </H1><H2>100^Percent Fat by Analysis </H2><H1>andmultiply; 100</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>PFF requirements are minimum levels for the average PFF value of all unitsin a production lot. Under the PFF approach, inspectors are aided in carryingout their responsibilities through a centrally administered sampling andevaluation program. The frequency of laboratory verification of an establishment'sin-plant controls varies with the degree of its past compliance with PFFrequirements. The compliance system keeps track of the process by utilizinga low sampling rate until there is an indication that the process may notbe ``in control''. In those instances, the frequency of sampling is increasedto determine whether there is reason for concern. If not, low level monitoringis resumed. However, if a problem does exist, each lot is assessed individuallyto determine compliance, and action is taken accordingly; i.e., productreworking or relabeling, as appropriate. When the process is shown to beback in control, the system returns to low level monitoring.Turkey ham is currently regulated under andSection; 381.171 (9 CFR 381.171).It is prepared from boneless turkey thigh meat without the skin and surfacefat attached thereto. Turkey ham is cured and may be smoked. It may containcure accelerators, phosphates, spices and other flavoring substances, asspecified in the regulations (9 CFR 381.147(f)(4)). Water may also be addedto dissolve and disperse these substances. The cooked finished productcannot weigh more than the original weight of the turkey thigh meat priorto curing (``green'' or uncured weight) (9 CFR 381.171(c)). This requirementis the basis for controlling the amount of added substances contained inturkey ham. The product name ``Turkey Ham'' must be qualified with thestatement ``Cured Turkey Thigh Meat'' (9 CFR 381.171(e)). If the productis made from pieces of turkey thigh meat instead of whole thighs, the productname must be further qualified by a descriptive statement (9 CFR 381.171(f)).If the pieces are equivalent in size to a \1/2\ inch cube or greater, thestatement ``Chunked and Formed'' must be included. If the pieces are smallerthan the equivalent of a \1/2\ inch cube, the statements ``Ground and Formed''or ``Chopped and Formed'', as appropriate, must be included.On September 16, 1985, the Standards and Labeling Division of FSIS issuedPolicy Memo 057A describing circumstances for the production and marketingof turkey ham products that contain added water resulting in the finishedproduct weighing more than the ``green'' weight.\1\<NOTE/> This is permitted provided the product is produced undera partial quality control (PQC) program and, in addition to the qualifiersset forth in andSection; 381.171 (9 CFR 381.171), is identified by showingthe percentage of added water; e.g., ``Turkey Ham and 12% Water''. Thispolicy was a modification of earlier ones developed to enable turkey hamproducers to market a ``water added'' product similar to pork ham products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A copy of the Policy Memo is available for review in theoffice of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.In response to the NTF petition, FSIS gathered data from poultry processingestablishments on turkey ham production in the United States. These datawere obtained from a 1984-85 turkey ham sampling which included all 34establishments producing turkey ham products.\2\<NOTE/> At two separate times, inspectors collected three representativesamples of turkey ham products from a single day's production. If ``flavoring''was included as an ingredient and the ``flavoring'' ingredients were unknown,a 4-ounce sample of ``flavoring'' was submitted along with the turkey hamproduct samples. All samples were analyzed by FSIS Science Field Serviceor contract laboratories to determine moisture, protein, and fat contentof each turkey ham product sample and protein content of each ``flavoring''sample. The data reflects product which contains water in excess of thatwhich is natural to thigh meat. This additional water is absorbed duringthe immersion chilling process following the slaughter and dressing operation.The amount of moisture absorption and retention allowed ranges from 4.3percent to 8 percent, depending on the weight of the turkey carcass, andis regulated by andSection; 381.66(d)(2) of the poultry products inspectionregulations (9 CFR 381.66(d)(2)). This is the ``green'' weight that theturkey ham must return to after curing. PFF values obtained during thisstudy from product identified as ``Turkey Ham'' agree closely with valuesin Agriculture Handbook 8 \3\<NOTE/> for ``Turkey Ham''.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Results from this sampling are available for review inthe FSIS Hearing Clerk's office between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A copy of the relevant information from this publicationis available for review in the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.The types of turkey ham product categories requested by NTF would be includedunder this proposal with the exception of ``Turkey Ham_Chopped''. FSISdoes not believe sufficient data exist at this time to determine an appropriatestandard for such a product.As in selecting the PFF approach for cured pork products, FSIS is principallyconcerned with assuring that protein levels in turkey ham products arenot diluted with added water or other substances, or, if so, that theyare appropriately identified. As with the current practice, fat contentwould not be regulated under this proposal. Although natural fat is removedin varying degrees during preparation, no fat may be added to turkey hamproducts.Turkey ham is intended as a poultry alternative to pork ham and shouldbe comparable in terms of the amount of protein on a fat free basis. Turkeyham has gained consumer acceptance and has been produced with certain characteristicsthat consumers have come to expect. In order to maintain these expectedcharacteristics the Administrator proposes to establish PFF values forturkey ham products which are the same as the values for similar pork hamproducts. The PFF values for products ``with natural juices'' and ``wateradded'' are based on 5 percent and 10 percent added substances, respectively.PFF values are proposed for turkey ham products containing 15 percent and20 percent added ingredients. At the time of the Agency's sampling studyon turkey ham products, the poultry industry was not producing such productswith added ingredients above 20 percent. Thus, data are not available topropose PFF values for products with larger amounts of added ingredients.All of the proposed PFF values are based on calculations from the limiteddata available to FSIS. FSIS will consider any appropriate data the industrymay wish to submit on turkey ham products to support different PFF values.Any data submitted should be in a mutually agreed upon format to facilitatesuch consideration. Persons wishing to submit data in support of differentPFF values should contact Mr. Clemons to discuss the format in which thedata will be offered.The proposed categories reflect the manner in which similar products areidentified in today's marketplace. Thus, this portion of the proposal shouldhave no immediate impact on processors or consumers in terms of familiaritywith labeling terminology.Since more varieties of turkey ham products would be introduced, some establishmentsmay encounter additional costs associated with labeling changes, if theydecide to market the new products. As the costs would be related to theprocessors' decisions as to which types of products they would produce,FSIS cannot predict estimated labeling costs.This proposal would also establish procedures for monitoring compliancewith the new PFF based requirements. The Department is proposing complianceprocedures which would permit it to obtain maximum benefit from limitedlaboratory capacity while (1) providing greater assurance that establishedproduct standards are being met, and (2) allowing statistically determinedtolerances consistent with good manufacturing practices.These proposed procedures, like the current system for cured pork products,include centrally directed sampling using FSIS data processing facilitieslocated in Washington, DC, laboratory analysis, and decisions based ona statistical treatment of laboratory results which would assure adherencewithin reasonable bounds to the proposed PFF standards. Generally, PFFshortages in some lots that might result from the variability inherentin good manufacturing practices, would be balanced by PFF overages in otherlots. Since the statistical treatment of laboratory results is the least expensiveelement of the proposed program, this element would be used to the fullestextent possible to assure with a high level of confidence, that collectionand analysis are kept at levels as moderate as the data permit. Thus, suchstatistical treatment would determine frequency of sampling for certainproducts within individual establishments. If, for example, laboratoryresults should indicate that the future likelihood of adulteration and/ormisbranding of a given product in a given establishment is small, the rateof sampling would be reduced, and the Agency's resources would be utilizedmore productively elsewhere. The Agency recognizes that the proposed compliance program is complex,event though steps have been taken to reduce such complexity without sacrificingits statistical validity. As a practical matter, in a compliance programdesigned to meet concerns for such interrelated factors as the nature ofthe product, the interests of the consuming public, production and marketingcharacteristics of the industry, economy in government, and equity amongprocessors, the maximum value of statistics and computerization cannotbe realized in a simple procedure. Prior experience with the protein fatfree compliance system for cured pork products has proved the validityof this approach. The Agency has carefully considered the complexity ofthe proposed compliance program and believes it is the best alternativeavailable to regulate the turkey ham industry fairly, effectively, andefficiently, and, at the same time, maintain the confidence of the publicregarding the wholesomeness and truthful labeling of the products beingmarketed by that industry. The Agency's success with the PFF system for cured pork products has influencedthis proposed compliance program. Unlike cured pork products, turkey hamproducts are essentially prepared and marketed in a similar manner. Atthis time, the turkey ham products would fit into only one grouping andwill be considered a single group. Unlike the cured pork products, turkeyham is not bone-in. By considering the currently marketed turkey ham productsas one group, the Agency is allowing flexibility for industry to developother turkey ham products, e.g., Turkey Ham with Natural Juices. This currentgrouping is intended to contribute only to the efficiency of the complianceprogram. Regulatory actions would be taken, if justified by analyticalresults, against individual products such as ``Turkey Ham, Water Added''rather than against all turkey ham products. Further analytical resultswill influence sampling frequency, pursuant to authorities expressed inthe existing regulations. As stated above, the Agency is proposing a single product group for turkeyham. Comments are requested on the need for additional product groups andthe criteria for each. The proposed rule would establish two general compliance phases: a normalor periodic sampling phase, and a daily sampling phase. A third phase,the retention phase, would also be established but would apply only toindividual products rather than to the Product Group. In the normal or periodic sampling phase, samples would be collected periodically,principally from within official establishments but with provisions forcollection in the distribution chain such as in storage warehouses andretail outlets. Initially, all establishments would be subject to samplingin this phase. A statistical analysis of laboratory findings could result,with respect to a given turkey ham product processor, in (1) continuationof the normal phase at the same or varying sampling frequency, (2) institutionof the daily sampling phase for the entire turkey ham Product Group, and/or(3) retention or detention \4\<NOTE/> of one or more individual products, based upon respectivesingle sample demonstrations of gross PFF shortages. When any single lotof a product was retained or detained, subsequent production of like productwould be affected, and thus the retention phase would be entered. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A product is ``U.S. Retained'' when it is not passed bythe inspector but rather is held in the official establishment for furtherexamination by the inspector to determine its disposal (9 CFR 381.1(b)(58)).A product is ``U.S. Detained'' when found by any authorized representativeof the Secretary upon any premises where it is held for the purposes of,or during, or after distribution in, commerce, and there is any reasonto believe that it is capable of use as human food, and is adulteratedor misbranded, or that it has not been inspected, or that it is otherwiseviolative of the law (9 CFR 381.1(b)(54)).In the daily sampling phase, analytical results could cause (1) continueddaily sampling, (2) a return to periodic sampling, (3) retention or detentionof one or more individual products by virtue of gross PFF shortages evidencedby single individual product samples, and/or (4) retention of one or moreindividual products based upon a series of lesser PFF shortages in samplesof such products, not balanced by PFF overages. If a lot were retainedor detained, under (3) or (4), such treatment would also be imposed uponfuture lots of like product, and thus the retention phase would be entered.In the retention phase, no production lot of an affected product wouldbe permitted to enter commerce until laboratory analysis demonstrated thatsuch lot meets the PFF standards. Sampling of the affected product wouldbe intensified further, and analytical results could cause: (1) Releaseof an individual lot into commerce, (2) an individual lot to be reprocessed,(3) an individual lot to be relabeled, (4) continuation of the retentionphase as future lots of like product are prepared, and/or (5) release offuture production from the retention phase. Within the broad framework outlined above, regulatory decisions would bereached through a number of precise and interrelated rules. These ruleswere originally constructed to enhance the Agency's efficiency in monitoringthe production of cured pork products, and at the same time provide industrythe latitude to operate within the limits of good manufacturing practicewithout penalty. This balanced approach has proven to be effective. TheAgency has carefully considered the relevancy of these rules to turkeyham products and has concluded that they can be used in a similar approach.The computations associated with these rules will be carried out by theFSIS data processing facilities in Washington, DC, and the results andnotification of any necessary regulatory action forwarded to the Agency'sinspector. However, in order to provide affected parties a foundation forcomment, a more detailed discussion of these rules and regulatory actionsfollows, keyed to the (a) normal or periodic sampling phase, (b) dailysampling phase, (c) retention phase, and (d) the absolute minimum PFF valueproposed for a single sample. (a) <T3>Normal or Periodic Sampling. </T3>This is the phase under which thecompliance program for the Product Group would begin. It would remain ineffect until there is evidence that minimum PFF percentage requirementsare not being met. Such evidence would be deemed to exist when, in a seriesof consecutive samples, the cumulation of the deviation from the productPFF requirement (termed the ``Group Value'') reaches a prescribed level,hereinafter referred to as the ``group action level''.The proposed regulations would identify for the Product Group, its standarddeviation \5\<NOTE/> (0.5) and also the level (1.65 standard deviations) at whichas PFF shortage would not be ascribed to reasonable manufacturing variations.This level is calculated to be reached by a single sample result with nomore than a 5 percent probability, if the establishment's production meetsbut does not exceed minimum PFF requirements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In statistics, the standard deviation is used to describethe degree of variability inherent in the set of measurements generatedfrom a process that is characterized by a normal distribution. The setof numbers will stay within one standard deviation on either side of theaverage value 68 percent of the time. The comparable figure for two standarddeviations is 96 percent, and for three standard deviations is over 99percent. By stating limits in units of standard deviations, one can usethe same set of limits for a number of processes. Standard deviations forwithin lot variability of products affected by this rulemaking were calculatedfrom a 1984 USDA survey of turkey ham products. The survey material isavailable for review in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office. Instructions would be provided for assigning values to analytical PFF findingsof individual samples. One rule would describe how the analytical resultsfrom an individual sample would contribute to a Group Value: (1) Subtract the minimum PFF requirement (for the product represented)from the individual PFF analysis. (2) Divide the resulting number by the standard deviation assigned to theProduct Group (0.5) to find the Standardized Difference. (3) Add 0.25 to the Standardized Difference to find the Adjusted StandardizedDifference. (4) Use the lesser of 1.90 and the Adjusted Standardized Difference asthe Sample Value which will contribute to the Group Value. (5) Cumulatively total the Sample Values to determine the Group Value.Each step comment: (1) Subtract the minimum PFF requirement (for the product represented)from the individual PFF analysis. This will result in a negative figure when the sample result does not meetminimum percentage requirements. (2) Divide the resulting number by the standard deviation assigned to theProduct Group (0.5) to find the Standardized Difference. The Standardized Difference expresses the PFF shortage (negative number)or overage (positive number) in units of standard deviations. This stepis included to provide a common unit for expressing the impacts of sampleresults without regard to Product Group. It permits the establishment ofa group action level and is a measure for use by establishment employeesand program officials that would close monitor the production of turkeyham products. (3) Add 0.25 to the Standardized Difference to find the Adjusted StandardizedDifference. By taking this step, the Agency is attempting to adopt a means of concentratingits resources on the more serious violations. Because of the relativelyinfrequent rate of sampling in this phase, there exists an expectationthat an extended time would transpire before problem areas would be identified.FSIS intends to reduce the probability of reaching the action level becauseof minor PFF violations, in return for having more resources availablefor concentration on gross or consistent PFF shortages. Adding this smallfigure to the Standardized Difference would have that effect. It wouldreduce the probability that the periodic sampling rate would increase,and add to the number of samples with like shortages that it would taketo trigger daily group samplings (i.e., to reach the group action level).It would have a similar but proportionately lesser impact on gross shortages.This lesser impact would be more than balanced by the increased samplingrate attendant with greater shortages. The 0.25 adjustment amounts to about0.1 or 0.2 percent of PFF. FSIS believes this to be a level which willonly marginally exceed sampling and analytical error, and will serve theintended purpose.  (4) Use the lesser of 1.90 and the Adjusted Standardized Difference asthe Sample Value which will contribute to the Group Value. FSIS proposes to ensure not only that PFF shortages are balanced by PFFoverages, but also that the severity and number of PFF shortages be keptto a minimum. It proposes, therefore, that no single Sample Value be usedbeyond the extent of 1.90 to balance shortages, even if the true SampleValue exceeds that figure. Before a Sample Value contributes to the GroupValue, it would be compared to the maximum Sample Value of 1.90. If itexceeds that figure, the Sample Value would be recorded as 1.90. The figure 1.90 is related to the 1.65 standard deviation earlier notedas the level at which a PFF shortage would not be ascribed to reasonablemanufacturing variations. The same applies to overages. That is, if theprocessor is producing at the minimum required PFF value, the probabilitywould be no more than 5 percent that the PFF content of a sample wouldbe greater than 1.65 standard deviations above the requirement. The Departmentviews this as a reasonable limit, believing that it is necessary to assurethat large one-time PFF overages are not used to offset a series of PFFshortages. Step (3) would establish an automatic addition to the StandardizedDifference calculated in step (2). Since the automatic addition, or tolerance(0.25), has no effect on the variability of the manufacturing process,it would be added to the 1.65 in order to assure the processor the fullbenefit of variability within a controlled process. In this fashion, 1.90is arrived at as a proposed maximum contribution to the group from a singlesample. (5) Cumulatively total the Sample Value to determine the Group Value. After the initial Sample Value is calculated, and becomes by itself theGroup Value, each succeeding Sample Value creates a new Group Value bybeing added to the last Group Value. Here again, a limit of the PFF coveragethat may be credited is imposed. The objective of this proposal is to assurethat the manufacturing process remains in control; i.e., that within reasonableand expected variation, minimum required PFF levels will be consistentlymet. If unlimited credits were to be accepted for overages (which couldbe due to poor control) it would become necessary, in order to assure withinreason that required PFF values are consistently met, to have a movingaction level_one that moved up and down with the Group Value. This wouldmake it difficult for establishment personnel and in-plant program officialsto accurately assess the effects of PFF levels on the probability of compliance.Further, maintaining a level above which overages cannot be credited effectivelyminimizes the impact that varying lot sizes might have on a group PFF average.Thus it would be that the Group Value would never exceed 1.00. That is,as Sample Values are cumulatively totaled, should the value exceed 1.00,it would be recorded as 1.00, and the next sample would be added to 1.00to find the new Group Value. The action level for the Group Value would be ^1.40; i.e., once the GroupValue becomes equal to ^1.40 or less (^1.40, ^1.45, ^1.47, etc.), dailysampling for the group would be initiated. This figure is consistent withthe rationale that when a PFF shortage is as large as 1.65 standard deviations,it would not be ascribed to reasonable variations. Step (3) above providesthat an adjustment of 0.25 be added to the Standardized Difference. Theresulting figure of ^1.40 is that level which is calculated to be reachedby a single sample with mo more than 5 percent probability, with the sameassumptions earlier associated with ^1.65 figure. A further characteristicis that, assuming the process average meets but does not exceed the minimumrequired PFF, on the average a series of 20 samples would be collectedbefore a cumulative shortage would reach this figure. The proposal would further provide that, concurrent with the Group Value,Product Values also be cumulatively maintained. While a Group alone wouldaffect only sampling frequency, a Product Value (supported by the GroupValue) could signal a much more serious event_product retention. Instructions for determining a Product Value would be as follows: (1) Subtract the minimum PFF requirement (for the product represented)from the individual PFF analysis. (2) Divide the resulting number by the group standard deviation to findthe Standardized Difference. (3) Use the lesser of 1.65 and the Standardized Difference as the SampleValue which will contribute to the Product Value. (4) Cumulatively total the Sample Value to determine the Product Value.There are significant departures from the proposed Group Value formula.While the first two steps are identical, the entire third group step isomitted in that there is no provision for the addition of a tolerance of0.25 to the Standardized Difference. FSIS recognizes that this omissioncreates the possibility that a Product Value might indicate a PFF shortagewhile the concurrent Group Value, because of the allowed tolerance, mightnot show a process control difficulty. Nevertheless, FSIS believes theelimination of a tolerance in determining the Product Value to have soundfoundation for the following reasons: (i) The 0.25 tolerance is proposed as a means of overcoming, in large part,the principal disadvantage of infrequent sampling by permitting a concentrationof resources on problem areas. With possible rare exceptions, the overwhelmingsignificance of Sample Values contributing to a Product Value which breachesthe action level will be in samples collected during a daily sampling phase.Therefore, the reasons for the tolerance do not exist.  (ii) The consumer's interest would not be served by permitting a constant0.25 tolerance to accumulate over a series of samples for a Product Value,particularly since much of the sampling would be on a daily basis.(iii) The proposal would protect processors against unreasonable jeopardyby requiring that the action levels of both the Product Value and GroupValue be reached in order that a retention phase be entered.Another difference is proposing 1.65 as the maximum credit that can becontributed by a single sample, as opposed to 1.90 which is used in establishinga contribution to a Group Value. This results from the 1.65 standard deviationsoccurring with no more than 5 percent probability and being unaffectedby a tolerance.In step (4), comparable to step (5) in the group calculation, Sample Valuesare totaled cumulatively to maintain the Product Value. After the initialSample Value is calculated and becomes by itself the Product Value, eachsucceeding Sample Value creates a new Product Value by being added to thelast Product Value. Reaching the action level with a Product Value hasmore serious consequences than reaching it with the Group Value; i.e.,provided the group action level has been reached by the Group Value, reachingthe product action level with the Product Value causes product on handto be retained and like product to be retained as it is produced. In keepingwith the earlier discussion, the product action level is ^1.65.While the maximum Group Value that would ever be recorded is 1.0, a ProductValue could be recorded as high as 1.15. In a series of simulations, FSISfound that a significant discrepancy between group performance and productperformance existed because of the 0.25 tolerance for Sample Values contributingto Group Values. The discrepancy could be reduced by allowing this slightlylarger credit to be built into the maximum Product Value. This nominalincrease in permitted credit, which must be earned, would reduce the probabilityof a well-controlled process reaching the product action level, while continuingto assure that required PFF levels would, on the average, be met. At thesame time, it would afford better synchronization of the Group Value andProduct Values. The outcome is that, if a process average equalled butdid not exceed PFF requirements, on the average, 12 samples would be collectedbefore the product action level is reached.In proposing these PFF standards, it is not the Agency's intent that theyrepresent a long-range average content, but rather a minimum content. Processorscan avoid retention by targeting at a process average that moderately exceedsthe minimum PFF requirement (a company's ability to control variation willdetermine the targeted process average). This is intended to avoid entryinto commerce of production lots not meeting the PFF standard.(b) <T3>Daily Sampling Phase. </T3>During this phase, Group Values and ProductValues are monitored in the same manner as in the periodic sampling phase,except for the higher sampling frequency. However, the Group Value willhave already reached its action level. As a group enters the daily samplingphase, it is very likely that one or more products in the group will immediatelyenter the retention phase by having reached the product action level. However,in this respect, the proposal would require two events to trigger a retentionphase for a product: (1) Group entry into the daily sampling phase, and(2) the Product Value reaching its action level.Since there is more than one product in the group, it is also likely thatone or more products would be monitored only as part of the daily samplingphase. Therefore, there would be no provisions for retaining a group <T3>per se</T3>; the group would continue to be monitored in the dailysampling phase until it qualifies for a return to periodic sampling. Itis proposed that this would happen when (1) the Group Value reaches orexceeds 0.00, (2) when each of the last seven Sample Values is ^1.65 orgreater, and (3) when none of the products in the group are in the retentionphase. All three conditions would be required to be met in order to returnto periodic sampling.If, as would be likely, one or more products were in the retention phase,the daily sampling scheme would be altered. As explained below, in theretention phase, product sampling would take on a new character and becomeintense. The retained product samples used to make lot dispositions anddetermine the Product Value could contribute to the Group Value. However,some sampling of retained product would be necessary to properly monitorthe group. These samples would be collected separately and would not contributeto the Product Value of the retained product. A retention sample couldserve as a daily sample.(c) <T3>Retention Phase. </T3>The retention phase would be entered on a product-by-productbasis. During this phase, each lot of the affected product would be withheldfrom commerce until it is demonstrated to be in compliance with minimumPFF requirements. A product could enter retention in two ways. One hasbeen described above. It is conditioned upon the product's being in dailysampling, and its own Product Value reaching a ^1.65 product action level(i.e., a series of shortages not compensated by overages adding up to 1.65standard deviations). The second way a product can enter the retentionphase would be for it to fail to meet the ``absolute minimum PFF value''proposed for a single sample.When a product enters the retention phase, sampling would increase. Threesamples would be randomly selected from each of all available affectedlots. Further, subsequently produced lots would be retained and sampledin like manner as they are prepared. Analytical results from a lot wouldbe used to dispose of that lot and to calculate a Sample Value contributingto the cumulatively maintained Product Value. With respect to those lotsfrom which four samples had been drawn (an original and three later), theoriginal sample would be used to calculate the Sample Value and the latterthree would be used only in determining disposition of the individual lot.With respect to subsequently produced lots, from which only three sampleswould be collected, the average PFF content of the three samples wouldbe used for both_disposition of the individual lot and calculation of theSample Value contributing to the Product Value.An individual lot would be released if one of the following occurs:(1) The average PFF content of the three samples equals or exceeds theminimum percentage required by the proposed regulation. Alternatively,for purposes of single lot disposition, but not to establish a new SampleValue which will contribute to the Product Value, further processing ofthe lot would be permitted. To evaluate the amount of moisture reductionneeded to achieve the desired PFF value, the following formula may be used:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,26,1,60</C><H1>Percent moisture reduction</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Desired increase in PFF valueandmultiply;(100-percent fat by analysis)</H1><H2>Current PFF value+desired increase in PFF value</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>Processing to reduce moisture would elevate PFF content of the lot. Theformula takes into account that products with a low fat content or lowinitial PFF value require greater moisture loss to increase the PFF value.However, the lot would no longer be representative of the product.(2) The lot of product is relabeled to conform to one of the proposed productdescriptions.(3) An earlier prepared lot had resulted in a Product Value that wouldremove the product from the retention phase.There is a time lag between the collection of samples and the reportingof results. During this lag, additional samples would have been collectedunless the product is prepared only periodically. FSIS proposes to acceptthe earliest evidence that a process is back in control and the productcomplies with regulatory requirements and, once this evidence is in hand,subsequently prepared product would be released even though other analyticalresults are being awaited. However, the awaited results would not be ignored.Each of the three samples from each lot would be compared to the absoluteminimum PFF requirement and the three-sample average would also be usedto continue maintenance of the Product Value. Therefore, there is the possibility(although not a likelihood) that the awaited sample results would returnthe product to the retention phase.Since the use of three-sample PFF averages would orinarily result in significantlyless perceived variability than would single-sample results, there wouldbe an alteration in determining Sample Values of retained product as follows:(1) Determine the average PFF content of the three samples.(2) Subtract the minimum PFF requirement for the product represented fromthe average found in (1) above.(3) Convert the difference found in (2) above to a Standardized Differencethrough dividing it by the standard deviation assigned to the group. (Throughthis step, the only difference from earlier described calculations is thata three-sample average is used rather than a single sample result.)(4) Use the lesser of 1.30 and the Standardized Difference obtained in(3) above as the Sample Value which will contribute to the Product Value.The difference between 1.30 and the 1.65 used in earlier calculations acknowledgesthat variability among three-sample averages would be less than variabilityamong single samples. FSIS recognizes that processors would likely prepareproduct with average PFF values greater than those required by the proposalin order to ensure that product will get out of the retention phase inthe shortest possible time. The maximum allowable credit of 1.30 is thatwhich would be reached about 8 percent of the time if the lot average PFFvalue exceeded the requirement by 0.5 percentage points.(5) Cumulatively total Sample Values calculated in the above manner todetermine the Product Value. The greatest Product Value that could be recordedremains at 1.15, as described earlier.The retention phase would end when, after 5 days of production (5 lots),the Product Value reaches 0.00 or greater, provided that no single sample(not the three-sample average) from a retained lot has a PFF content lessthan the absolute minimum PFF requirement. Should a single sample havea PFF content less that the absolute minimum, the 5-day count would beginagain. Ending of the retention phase would reinstitute periodic or dailysampling, dependent upon the Group Value and other Product Values in thegroup.As long as a product was in the retention phase, the group would remainin the daily sampling phase. under normal circumstances, this would bea reasonable condition of process control. However, if a product were preparedinfrequently, its presence in the retention phase could easily keep itsgroup in daily sampling well beyond any legitimate purpose. FSIS proposesto afford processors an option in this respect. If, when a product entersthe retention phase, it can be demonstrated that its production rate forthe previous 8 weeks was not more than 20 percent of the production rateof the group, the proposal would permit a processor (at the option of theprocessor) to temporarily remove the product from its group. This removal,however, could be in effect only while the product is in retention. Ifthe option were exercised, during that time, the product and the groupwould be treated separately and analytical results of the product wouldnot cause daily sampling of the group. It should be noted that productionrate by proposed defintion is not synonymous to volume of production, butis production frequency, expressed in days per week.(d) <T3>Absolute Minimum PFF Requirements.</T3> FSIS proposes to establishfor individual samples an absolute minimum PFF requirement for every turkeyham product with a PFF standard. Should a single sample fail to meet thisminimum, the represented lot would be retained if in an official establishmentand, unless voluntarily recalled, would be subject to administrative detentionif not in an official establishment. Any subsequently produced lots oflike product for which production dates cannot be established shall beretained or subject to administrative detention. Further, future productionwould be prepared in the retention phase.The absolute minimum PFF requirement for a single sample of a cooked productwould be 1.5 percentage points below the standard for the represented product.This figure represents approximately three standard deviations, and thereis less than a 1 percent chance that a properly controlled process wouldresult in such failure.(e) <T3>Quality Control. </T3>Establishments may institute quality controlprocedures covering turkey ham products under andSection; 381.145 of thepoultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 381.145). Turkey ham productsproduced in such establishments would be exempt from the proposed complianceprocedure, provided in-plant quality control programs show the same orhigher degree of compliance.For various reasons, FSIS has in the past and will in the future conductinspection of poultry and poultry products, including sampling and laboratoryanalysis, at various points in commerce, including the point of consumerpurchase. With respect to turkey ham products, it is expected that suchinspection will include PFF determinations. In such cases, if absoluteminimum PFF requirements are not met, the Agency intends to enforce thedetention and, under appropriate circumstances, the judicial seizure provisionsof the PPIA, and to institute the retention phase for future preparationof like product at the producing establishment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 9, Subchapter C, Part 381,of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as set forthbelow:<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 381</ITAG>Poultry products inspection.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 981_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Upon receipt of such results,they shall be subjected to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(2)of this section. (2) The PFF content of three randomly selected samples from each U.S. retainedlot shall be used to maintain the Product Value described in paragraph(b)(2)(ii). The manner and effect of such maintenance shall be as follows:(i) Find the average PFF content of the three samples. (ii) Determine the difference between that average and the applicable minimumPFF percentage requirement of andSection;381.171(c). The resulting figureshall be negative when the average of the sample results is less than theapplicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive whenthe average of the sample results is greater than the applicable minimumPFF requirement. (iii) Divide the resulting figure by the standard deviation assigned tothe product's group in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, to find theStandardized Difference. (iv) Use the lesser of 1.30 and the Standardized Difference as the SampleValue.(v) Add the first Sample Value thus calculated to the latest Product Valuecalculated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this sectionto find the new Product Value. To find each succeeding Product Value, addthe most recent Sample Value to the existing Product Value: Provided, however,That in no event shall the Product Value exceed 1.15. When the additionof a Sample Value to an existing Product Value results in a figure greaterthan 1.15, the Product Value shall be recorded as 1.15 and all previousSample Values shall be ignored in determining future Product Values. (vi) New lots of like product shall continue to be retained pending dispositionin accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section until, after 5 daysof production, the Product Value is 0.00 or greater, and the PFF contentof no individual sample from a U.S. retained lot is less than the absoluteminimum PFF requirement specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.Should an individual sample fail to meet its absolute minimum PFF requirement,the 5-day count shall begin anew. (vii) When U.S. retention of new lots is discontinued under the above provisions,maintenance of the Product Value shall revert to the provisions of paragraph(b)(2)(ii) of this section. (3) For purposes of this section, the establishment owner or operator shallhave the option of temporarily removing a product from its Product Group,provided product lots are being U.S. retained, as produced, and providedfurther that the average production rate of the product, over the 8-weekperiod preceding the week in which the first U.S. retained lot was prepared,is not greater than 20 percent of the production rate of its group. Whena product is thus removed from its group, analytical results of productsamples shall not cause daily sampling of the group. When pursuant to paragraph(c)(2)(vi) of this section, new lots of the product are no longer beingU.S. retained, the product shall again be considered with its group. (d) <T3>Adulterated and misbranded products.</T3> Products not meeting specifiedPFF requirements, determined according to procedures set forth in thissection may be deemed adulterated and misbranded under section 4(g) ofthe Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 453(g)). (e) <T3>Quality control.</T3> With respect to cured turkey ham products, officialestablishments may institute quality control procedures under andSection;381.145(c)of this subchapter. Cured turkey ham products produced in such establishmentsshall be exempt from the requirements of this section; provided in-plantquality control procedures are shown to attain the same or higher degreeof compliance as the procedures set forth in this section: <T3>Provided,</T3> however, That all cured turkey ham products producedshall be subject to the applicable minimum PFF content requirement, regardlessof any quality control procedures in effect. 3.
