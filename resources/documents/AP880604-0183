Paul Tudor Jones II earned his millions by trading $75 billionworth of financial and commodity futures, according to FinancialWorld, which published ``The Wall Street 100'' in its June 28 issue.   Jones, founder and president of Tudor Investment Corp., ``guessedright in the futures pits,'' the magazine said.   George Soros of Soros Fund Management was ranked second on thelist, with income of at least $75 million, the magazine said.   Henry Kravis and George Roberts of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.each made more than $70 million while Michael Milken of DrexelBurnham Lambert brought in at least $60 million, Financial Worldreported.   Michel David-Weill of Lazard Freres made $54 million and JeromeKohlberg of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts brought home at least $35million, it said.   The top 10 was rounded out by John Winberg of Goldman Sachs withat least $32 million, Donald Carter of the Carter Organization withbetween $30 million and $32 million and Theodore Forstmann ofForstmann Little with at least $30 million.   Because 48 Goldman, Sachs partners qualified for the Wall Street100, the magazine put them on a separate list and included onlyChairman John Weinberg on the top 100 list.   The magazine said the top 100 grossed about $2 billion or anaverage of about $12 million per person, not including the Goldman,Sachs partners.   The magazine said Neuberger andamp; Berman would have had four or fiveof its people on the list but big losses during the October stockmarket crash cost the company about one-third of its capital.   It also said 1987 bonuses were slashed an average of 25 percentto 50 percent, Shearson Lehman Hutton levied cutbacks of between 25percent and 50 percent in some areas and about 80 percent of SmithBarney's managing directors took pay cuts.</TEXT></DOC>
