McKinney Homeless AssistanceAct (Pub. L. 100-77, signed July 22, 1987) established a number of programsto assist homeless persons, including the Emergency Community ServicesHomeless Grant Program (EHP) (Title VII, Subtitle D, Sections 751-754 and762 of Pub. L. 100-77) (42 U.S.C. 11461-11464 and 11472). The McKinneyAct has since been amended by Pub. L. 100-628 with respect to eligibleuses of the EHP funds, among other things (Title VII, Subtitle A, Section704 of Pub. L. 100-628, signed November 7, 1988). The EHP program is operatedby the Office of Community Services (OCS) within the Family Support Administration(FSA) of HHS. The McKinney Act provides that the funds appropriated forthe EHP program are to be distributed to States that receive funds underthe Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program (42 U.S.C. 9901 <T3>et seq.), </T3>using the allocation formula that applies to the CSBGprogram. In addition, the Act sets aside EHP funds to be awarded directlyto certain Indian tribes.Interim final regulations to implement the EHP program were published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23568), and a 30-daycomment period was provided. We have made changes to the interim finalregulations based on our evaluation of the comments received, our experienceresulting from the initial implementation of the fiscal year 1988 EHP grants,and statutory changes made to the McKinney Act since publication of theinterim final regulations. The regulations, revised as appropriate, arenow being made final. We have kept them to a minimum, consistent with theDepartment's policy of allowing maximum flexibility to the States and localitiesin providing services to their citizens. The provisions of the regulationsare discussed below, together with the comments that were received.<ITAG tagnum="85">Justification for Dispensing With Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) creates an exception to generalnotice and comment rulemaking procedures where the agency for good causefinds that those procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, or contraryto the public interest. In addition to changes made to the interim finalrule as a result of public comment, this final rule contains provisionsdesigned to implement amendments to the EHP program contained in the StewartB. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. 100-628, whichwas enacted into law on November 7, 1988. Section 1080.3 of the regulationsincludes a statutory clarification setting aside 0.5% of annual appropriationsfor the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands,the Republic of Palau, and the Virgin Islands. Sections 1080.4 and 1080.5have been changed to allow EHP funds to be used for the prevention of homelessness.Section 1080.5 has been revised to include an assurance that the Statewill make every effort to award funds within 60 days of receipt. We haveincorporated these amendments without interpretation, and therefore believenotice of proposed rulemaking as to these new regulatory requirements isunnecessary. We have also made minor changes to the application proceduresdescribed in andSection;andSection;1080.5 and 1080.6 in order to insure thatOCS is able to carry out its statutory responsibility to distribute EHPfunds only on the basis of an approvable application. Finally, we haveincluded in andSection;andSection;1080.5 and 1080.8 coordination of effortrequirements designed to carry out Congress' intent that all levels ofgovernment and the private sector work together in attacking homelessness.As these changes clarify and complete the procedures set out in the interimfinal rule without changing the substance of the EHP program or the relationshipbetween the Federal government and EHP grantees, we have concluded thatthese procedural changes are exempt from notice of proposed rulemakingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="85">Analysis of Comments on and Changes to Interim Final Regulations </ITAG>Many of the comments we received appear to be based on misconceptions thatthe EHP program is subject to all the statutory and regulatory provisionsof the CSBG program, also administered by OCS. Although there are manysimilarities between the programs, the statutes setting them up are differentin many respects. We have included specific language in these regulationsin those cases where we intend the CSBG procedures to apply to EHP. Inall other respects, the programs should be considered to be separate. Income Eligibility Criteria Several of the public comments received revolved around the issue of incomeguidelines for establishing an individual's eligibility for receiving assistanceunder this program. Comments suggested allowing those persons with incomesup to 125% of the official poverty line to participate in programs fundedunder EHP. An income eligibility guideline was not included in the interim final regulationsbecause we felt the definition of ``homeless individual'' contained inthe McKinney Act was drawn tightly enough to ensure that assistance wasprovided only to those truly in need. We continue to believe this to bethe case, and thus have not adopted this suggestion. We leave to the discretionof the States the authority to impose an income eligibility criterion,should they believe it to be necessary. One comment also inquired as to whether benefits received under an EHP-fundedprogram would be considered as income or resources for purposes of determiningeligibility and benefit levels for other federally assisted programs suchas AFDC and food stamps. The comment went on to suggest that receipt ofEHP-funded benefits specifically be excluded from eligibility and benefitlevel calculations for other programs. We have not adopted this suggestedchange. We do not have statutory authority under the McKinney Act to excludebenefits provided under that Act from consideration as income or resourcesunder any public assistance program. Determinations as to whether to excludeMcKinney Act benefits must be made by the Federal and State authoritiesresponsible for administering each program, based on a review of the Federalstatutory and regulatory provisions governing each program as well as theimplementing policies of individual States. Allocation of Funds As a result of an amendment to the McKinney Act contained in Pub. L. 100-628,we have made a minor change to andSection; 1080.3 of the interim final regulationsto clarify that EHP funds will be allocated in accordance with the formulaset forth in sections 674 (a) and (b) of the CSBG Act. Congress, intentin enacting this amendment was to set aside 0.5 percent of annual appropriationsfor the territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands,Republic of Palau, and Virgin Islands. These wording changes will not affectthe allocation of funds, since we had already interpreted the McKinneyAct in this fashion for fiscal years 1987 and 1988. In addition, we have clarified the language of the regulations to specificallyexclude implementation of subsection (c) of section 674 of the CSBG Actfor the EHP program. Subsection (c), which provides for allocation of CSBGfunds to certain Indian tribes, is not needed because andSection; 1080.7of the regulations implements a McKinney Act provision that sets asidenot less than 1.5 percent of appropriations for federally recognized Indiantribes. Homelessness Prevention Activities Several comments suggested that the regulations allow the funding of activitiesto prevent homelessness, such as the payment of rent or mortgage paymentsto avoid eviction and foreclosure. We understand that it is often morecost-effective to prevent someone from becoming homeless, rather than waitingfor them to be evicted and then trying to help them get utility depositsand pay two months' rent in advance. For Fiscal Years 1987 and 1988, however,we were limited to the McKinney Act's requirements that the funds be usedonly for those who were already homeless. The McKinney Act has now been amended to allow a State to use up to 25percent of its EHP allocation to fund homelessness prevention activities,under certain specified conditions (Pub. L. 100-628). We have amended andSection;andSection;1080.4(d) and 1080.5(b)(6) of the regulations to reflect this change inthe law, which became effective for all activities funded after October1, 1988, the beginning of fiscal year 1989 and the effective date of Pub.L. 100-628. The conference report and Senate floor debate on H.R. 4352,which later became Pub. L. 100-628, make clear that Congress intended thisamendment to govern expenditures for any preventative activities fundedafter the beginning of fiscal year 1989. Accordingly, these regulationswould allow fiscal years 1987 and 1988 funds to be used for this purposeafter October 1, 1988, as well as funds appropriated for fiscal year 1989and subsequent years. No EHP funds, whatever the year. involved, may beused to cover prevention activities conducted prior to October 1, 1988.State Application Procedures We have revised andSection; 1080.5 of the interim final regulations in severalrespects. First, we have clarified that changes to an approved State EHPapplication must be submitted to OCS for approval before they may be implemented.This differs from CSBG, where notice of changes is advisory, because ofstatutory differences. Also, we have clarified that the assurances requiredby andSection; 1080.5 must be signed by the Governor or his/her designee. Second, we have added three items to the list of assurances that mustbe included in a State's application. The first requires the State to makeevery effort to award the EHP funds to eligible organizations within 60days of their receipt from the Federal government. Pub. L. 100-628, theMcKinney Act amendments, requires the States to award these funds within60 days of receipt, but provides that enforcement of the requirement isleft solely to the discretion of the Secretary of HHS. The conference reporton the amendments states that the provision is not intended to providecommunity action agencies with a right of action against States that donot comply with the disbursement requirement. Our experience with the EHPprogram over the last 2 fiscal years, as well as many years experiencewith the CSBG program, has shown that a strict 60-day obligation requirementis very difficult for the States to administer in many cases, and can becounterproductive if grant awards are rushed through without adequate reviewor controls. The regulation implements this provision of Pub. L. 100-628by requiring States to certify that every effort will be made to meet the60-day obligation provision. The second new assurance implements a McKinney Act amendment to limitto 25 percent the amount of EHP funds that may be used in any fiscal yearfor the homelessness prevention activities authorized in andSection; 1080.4(d).The third new assurance requires the State to have mechanisms in placeto assure coordination among the State and local agencies serving the homeless.This is to include coordination at the State level with the agency responsiblefor developing the Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan required by section401 of the McKinney Act. This carries out the McKinney Act intent thatall levels of government and the private sector work together in attackinghomelessness. We have also added a provision to andSection; 1080.8 of theregulations requiring grantees to discuss coordination efforts in theirannual report. Finally, we have clarified our interpretation of agencies and organizationsthat may be funded by the State. The McKinney Act uses the term ``communityaction agencies that are eligible to receive amounts under section 675(c)(2)(A)of the Community Services Block Grant Act * * * '' to describe entitiesthat are eligible to be funded under the EHP program. We have interpretedthis language to mean all agencies and organizations that meet the definitionof ``eligible entity'' included in section 673(1) of the CSBG Act (42 U.S.C.9902(1)). This will make the EHP program more consistent with administrationof the CSBG Act, and will allow for an updating of eligible organizationsto reflect changes in State needs and population. Minor language changeshave been included in the regulations to reflect this interpretation.Funding of Alternative OrganizationsThe McKinney Act provides that if a State does not apply for or submitan approvable EHP application, the Secretary is to award the State's allocationdirectly to eligible organizations within the State. We have made somechanges to andSection; 1080.6 of the regulations to clarify that the alternativeorganizations to be funded must apply for the funds. Should any of theeligible organizations fail to submit an approvable application, the fundsthat would otherwise be allocated to them will be reapportioned to theremaining eligible organizations on a pro rata basis.Building Acquisition and Construction One comment received suggested that the regulations be amended to allowthe use of EHP funds for the purchase and/or renovation of buildings tobe used as shelters. We do not believe that such a provision is necessary.Neither the regulations nor the McKinney Act restricts the use of EHP fundsfor the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of buildings for usein connection with homeless activities. There is such a statutory restrictionon the use of CSBG funds for such purposes, but that restriction does notapply to the EHP program. Each State may decide if it wants to impose anyrestrictions in this area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>Section 1080.1 Scope The regulations apply to the Emergency Community Services Homeless GrantProgram. Section 1080.2 Definitions The regulations include a definition of ``homeless individual'' that istaken directly from the McKinney Act, and a definition of ``Indian tribe''that is limited to federally-recognized tribes, as required by the McKinneyAct. This differs from the CSBG program, which allows direct grants byOCS to both federally and state-recognized tribes. ``State'' is defined to include the 50 States, the District of Columbia,the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau.This definition is consistent with that used for the CSBG program. Section 1080.3 Allocation of Funds The regulations implement the McKinney Act requirement that the EHP fundsbe allocated to States that receive funds under the CSBG Act, using theallocation formula that applies to CSBG, as set out in subsections (a)and (b) of section 674 of Pub. L. 9735 (42 U.S.C. 9903(a)(1)). These sectionsprovide that funds will go to the 50 States, as well as the District ofColumbia and Puerto Rico. In addition, 0.5 percent of annual appropriationsare set aside for the 5 territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern MarianaIslands, Republic of Palau, and Virgin Islands. Section 1080.7 of the regulationsimplements a McKinney Act provision that sets aside not less than 1.5 percentof annual appropriations for federally-recognized Indian tribes. For thisreason, the regulations specifically exclude implementation of subsection(c) of section 674 of the CSBG Act for the EHP program, since that subsectiondeals with funding for Indian tribes. Section 1080.4 Eligible Use of Funds As required by the McKinney Act as amended, the regulations state thatgrant recipients may use EHP funds only to: (a) Expand comprehensive servicesto homeless individuals to provide followup and long-term services to helpthem make the transition out of poverty; (b) provide assistance in obtainingsocial and maintenance services and income support services for homelessindividuals; (c) promote private sector and other assistance to homelessindividuals; and (d) after October 1, 1988, provide assistance under certainconditions to individuals who have received a notice of foreclosure, eviction,or termination of utility services, in order to prevent them from becominghomeless. To implement stated Congressional intent, this provision wouldallow fiscal year 1987 and 1988 funds to be used for this purpose afterOctober 1, 1988, as well, in addition to funds appropriated for fiscalyear 1989 and subsequent years. No EHP funds, whatever the year involved,may be used to cover prevention activities conducted prior to October 1,1988. Section 1080.5(b)(6) has been added to the regulations to prohibita State from using more than 25 percent of the amounts received to fundthe homelessness prevention activities covered in item (d) above, as requiredby the McKinney Act amendments. Section 1080.5 Application Procedures for States Under the terms of the McKinney Act, a State must apply to OCS for theEHP funds. These regulations specify that State applications must be submittedat a time established by the Secretary. It is intended that the applicationdeadline will be contained in a letter to each State from the Secretary.Any changes to the information required to be submitted by andSection; 1080.5(b)after the application has been approved must be submitted to and approvedby OCS before they are implemented. Applications can be in any format, but must describe the agencies, organizations,and activities the State intends to support with the funds received. Theapplication must also include several statutorily-required assurances,signed by the Governor or his/her designee. The State must certify thatit will award all the funds to community action agencies and other entitieseligible to receive funds under section 675(c)(2)(A) of the CSBG Act (42U.S.C. 9904(c)(2)(A)), organizations serving migrant and seasonal farmworkers,and certain other organizations that received FY 1984 CSBG funds from aState under special waiver provisions included in Pub. L. 98-139. (Thereare about 40 ``special waiver'' organizations located in only 3 States_Colorado,Utah, and Wyoming). Not less than 90 percent of the amounts must go toeligible organizations that were providing services to meet the criticallyurgent needs of homeless individuals as of January 1, 1987. The funds maynot be used to supplant or replace other homeless assistance programs administeredby the State, or to defray State administrative expenses. The State mustmake every effort to award the funds to its subgrantees within 60 daysof their receipt from the Federal government. Further, no more than 25percent of the money received by a State may be used to fund activitiesto prevent homelessness under andSection; 1080.4(d) of the regulations. Finally,the State is required to have mechanisms in place to assure coordinationamong the State and local agencies serving the homeless. This is to includecoordination at the State level with the agency responsible for developingthe Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan required by Section 401 of theMcKinney Act.The McKinney Act uses the term ``community action agencies that are eligibleto receive amounts under section 675(c)(2)(A) of the Community ServicesBlock Grant Act * * * '' to describe entities that are eligible to be fundedunder the EHP program. We have interpreted this language to mean all agenciesand organizations that meet the definition of ``eligible entity'' includedin section 673(1) of the CSBG Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(1)). This will make theEHP program more consistent with administration of the CSBG Act, and willallow for an updating of eligible organizations to reflect changes in Stateneeds and population. Section 1080.6 Funding of Alternative Organizations Under the McKinney Act, if a State fails to apply for its share of theavailable funds or does not submit an approvable application, the Secretaryis to award the State's allocation directly to other organizations withinthe State. Only those organizations eligible for funding by the State underthe EHP program (e.g., community action and other eligible agencies, organizationsserving migrant and seasonal farmworkers, and ``special waiver'' recipientorganizations) may receive funding under this section. These regulationsprovide that the Secretary will award all of the funds to eligible organizationsin the State involved, in the same proportion as the State distributedits CSBG funds to those organizations for the previous fiscal year, subjectto the Act's requirement that not less than 90 percent of the funds mustbe awarded to such organizations that were serving the homeless as of January1, 1987. States generally update their CSBG distribution formulas annuallyto account for shifts in needs and population. Using the State's most recentformula to distribute EHP funds will allow the Secretary to allocate fundsto those areas the State has recently deemed most in need. An applicationwill be required from those organizations that are funded under this section.If one or more of the organizations eligible to be funded under this sectiondoes not apply for or submit an approvable application, the amounts thatwould have been allocated to them will be reapportioned to the remainingeligible organizations on a pro rata basis. Section 1080.7 Funding of Indian Tribes Section 762 of the McKinney Act specifies that not less than 1.5 percentof any funds appropriated for EHP are to be set aside and distributed byOCS directly to Indian tribes. These regulations state that only thosefederally-recognized tribes that apply for and receive CSBG funds directlyfrom the Office of Community Services in any fiscal year will be eligibleto receive direct grants of EHP funds from OCS for that year. A minimumgrant award amount is also established. Those tribes that would otherwisereceive between $1 and $500 under the allocation formula would have thatamount raised to $500. Those tribes that would receive between $501 and$999 will instead receive a $1000 award. The regulations do not require Indian tribes to submit an EHP applicationbecause we believe that a separate application requirement would be tooburdensome, given the small amount of funds involved. Eligible federally-recognizedIndian tribes that apply for a CSBG direct grant under section 674(c) ofthe CSBG Act (42 U.S.C. 9903(c)) will be considered to have applied foran EHP grant. Acceptance of its CSBG application by OCS will constituteapproval of an EHP grant for an Indian tribe. <ITAG tagnum="81">Indian Funding Formula </ITAG>The Indian set-aside funds will be allocated to eligible tribes on thebasis of the size of the tribe's population living in poverty. The tribe'spoverty population will be determined by multiplying its overall populationby the rural poverty rate for Indians in the State in which the tribe islocated. Each tribe's poverty population will then be compared to the totalpoverty population of all tribes funded under this section to determineits share of the funds, adjusted if necessary to reflect the minimum grantaward. The regulations specify that the figures used to calculate the sizeof a tribe's poverty population will be those established by OCS for thepurposes of making direct grant awards to Indian tribes for the CSBG program.Any changes made to those figures by OCS will also be applied to the EHPprogram. As an example, if a tribe with a total population of 3,000 is located ina State where the Indian rural poverty rate is 50 percent, the tribe'spoverty population will be 1500 (3,000andmultiply;50%=1500). If 5 tribeswith a total poverty population of 10,000 were funded, then one tribe witha poverty population of 1500 would receive 15 percent of the availablefunds (1500 divided by 10,000=15%). If the total EHP set-aside funds availablewere $20,000, this tribe would receive $3,000 ($20,000andmultiply;15%=$3,000).If the allocation calculated under this formula came to less than the minimumgrant amount of $500 or $1,000, the amount would be adjusted up to thatamount, and the allocations for the other tribes would be adjusted downproportionately to accommodate it.Section 1080.8 Reporting Requirements These regulations require all EHP grant recipients to report annually toOCS on their implementation of the EHP program. The report is to indicatethe types of activities funded, any efforts undertaken by the grantee andits subgrantees to coordinate homeless activities funded under the EHPprogram with other state and community homeless assistance activities,the number of individuals served, and any impediments to homeless individuals,use of the program or to their obtaining services or benefits under theprogram. The report may be in any format, but must be submitted within6 months of the end of the period covered by the report (e.g., the reportwill be due by March 31 for the fiscal year which ended on September 30of the previous year). We would strongly encourage grantees, however, tosubmit their reports by December 31 of each year, while the details ofthe program are still fresh. This information will allow HHS to fulfillits obligation under section 203(c) of the McKinney Act to report annuallyto Congress and the Interagency Council on the Homeless on the implementationand effectiveness of the programs funded by the Act.Section 1080.9 Other RequirementsThe McKinney Act is silent on a number of administrative details necessaryto ensure that EHP funds are spent as intended by the law. We have determinedthat the best way to ensure that the intent of Congress is carried outis to make the EHP program subject to a few selected regulations that arecurrently applicable to the HHS block grant programs, including CSBG.These regulations apply to EHP the payment regulations applicable to theHHS block grant programs (45 U.S.C. Part 96, Subpart B, andSection; 96.12,as amended). Those block grant regulations provide that the Secretary willmake payments to the grantees at such times and in such amounts as areconsistent with section 203 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (42U.S.C. 4213) and Treasury Circular No. 1075 (31 CFR Part 205). Those regulationsin essence are intended to limit the amount of time elapsing between agrantee's acquisition of federal funds and their expenditure, and meanthat many awards may be disbursed in more than one payment, rather thanin a lump sum, thus reducing federal interest costs. The regulations make the HHS block grant regulations concerning the timeperiod for obligation and expenditure of funds (45 U.S.C. Part 96, SubpartB, andSection; 96.14) applicable to EHP. Those regulations provide that fundsthat a State has not obligated by the end of the fiscal year in which theywere first allotted will remain available for obligation during the followingfiscal year.Also applying to EHP are the financial management and audit regulationsapplicable to the HHS block grant programs (45 U.S.C. Part 96, SubpartC, as amended). Those regulations require States to obligate and expendfederal grant funds in accordance with the laws and procedures applicableto the obligation and expenditure of their own funds. Those regulationsalso require States and tribes that receive over $100,000 in federal grantfunds from all sources to conduct a single audit of all federal financialassistance under the terms of the Single Audit Act (Pub. L. 98-502). Statesand Indian tribes that receive between $25,000 and $100,000 in federalgrants may either conduct a single audit or an audit that meets the statutoryrequirements of that program. Since the McKinney Act does not prescribeaudit requirements for EHP, these grantees must also conduct a single audit.States or tribes that receive less than $25,000 in federal funds from allsources are not subject to federal audit requirements. The HHS block grantaudit regulations specify reporting deadlines for audits, and lay out proceduresfor the repayment of funds found by the audit to have been spent improperly.The block grant regulations also identify the Regional Office of Investigationsof the Department's Office of Inspector General as the agency to whichStates and Indian tribes should report information relating to possiblefraud or other offenses against the United States.These regulations also specify that all EHP grants are subject to the enforcementregulations applicable to the HHS block grant programs (45 CFR Part 96,Subpart E, as amended). Those regulations establish procedures for acceptingand responding to complaints that a recipient has improperly spent federalfunds. They include the right to a hearing on the complaint, appeal rights,and repayment of funds.Finally, the EHP regulations state that grant recipients are subject tothe hearing procedures regulations applicable to the HHS block grant programs(45 CFR Part 96, Subpart F). Those regulations specify the procedures andtime requirements for a hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact Analysis</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules, which are defined in the Order as any rule that has anannual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more or has certainother specified effects. The Department has determined that these regulationsare not major rules within the meaning of the Executive Order because theywill not have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or otherwisemeet the threshold criteria.Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6),the Department tries to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperworkrequirements on small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities'', an analysis is prepareddescribing the rule's impact on small entities. Small entities are definedin the Act to include small businesses, small nonprofit organizations,and small governmental entities. The primary impact of these regulationsis on the States, which are not ``small entities'' within the meaning ofthe Act. For this reason, the Secretary certifies that these rules willnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Paperwork Reduction ActUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewand approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirements in a proposedor final rule. These regulations include two provisions that were originallypublished as a part of the interim final regulations published on June22, 1988 (53 CFR Part 23568). The first of these provisions requires grantrecipients to submit an annual report to OCS on their implementation ofthe EHP program and any impediments to homeless individuals' use of theprogram or to their obtaining services or benefits under the program. Thisinformation is essential so that HHS can fulfill its obligation under section203(c) of the McKinney Act to report to Congress and the Interagency Councilon the Homeless on the implementation and effectiveness of the programsfunded by the Act.
