The ruling by a probate judge granted joint physical custody ofNicole LaLonde to Stephen and Virginia LaLonde, effective July 9.The girl will be with her father four days a week and with hermother the rest of the time.   But Stephen LaLonde won sole legal custody, giving him the powerto determine such matters as where Nicole attends school and herday-to-day care.   About 50 women gathered outside the Statehouse on Thursdayafternoon to protest Wednesday's decision. Many work at rape crisiscenters, while others were victims of rape or incest, said DedeKetover, a rally organizer.   ``I'm here because the judge put out a very clear message thattells kids, `If you've been molested, don't talk about it because noone's going to believe you,' and that tells mothers that if you'regoing to fight for your kids you're going to lose,'' Ketover said.``The courts can't protect these kids.''   ``The system has failed Nicole,'' Kim Morrison, a counselor atthe Boston Area Rape Crisis Center said earlier. ``They have leftopen the possibility of sexual abuse after all this trauma. Nicolehas gotten nowhere.''   But Suffolk County Probate Judge Mary Fitzpatrick ruled theevidence did not prove that LaLonde sexually abused and threatenedNicole.   The judge, describing Nicole as intelligent and eager to pleaseher parents, noted that the child vacillated in her story andrecanted more than once.   ``Under these circumstances, the court cannot simply take thechild's word as the truth since the court would be in the untenableposition of having to arbitrarily select one of the child's versionsover another,'' Ms. Fitzpatrick said.   ``At the same time, the fact tha Nicole has wavered in herallegations does not automatically preclude the veracity of thoseallegations,'' she said.   The judge also ordered that Nicole continue receivingpsychotherapy.   Ms. LaLonde's attorney, Beth Herr, said the decision would beappealed. She said her client was ``very concerned about herdaughter's welfare and safety.''   LaLonde was elated by the ruling, said his attorney, PeterDiGangi.   The LaLondes began fighting over their daughter's custody in aclosed trial that began May 1988 in Boston before Fitzpatrick.   Ms. LaLonde and her daughter claimed the child had been abused byLaLonde, who denied the accusation.   The LaLondes divorced in 1983. Three years later, Ms. LaLondeaccused her ex-husband of abusing their child during visits. Anotherprobate judge ruled the charges were unfounded.   Rather than see Stephen LaLonde gain custody, mother and childfled the state in June 1986 and settled in Florida. In March 1987,Ms. LaLonde returned to Massachusetts alone.   After Ms. LaLonde refused to say where Nicole was, a judgeordered her imprisoned until she revealed the child's location. Shespent six months in state prison.   Ms. LaLonde was freed only after a baby sitter in Durham, N.C.,tipped police that the child was being sheltered by an undergroundnetwork of women.   Nicole was brought back to the state in October 1987, and wasplaced by the state with a foster family.   Ms. Fitzpatrick said Wednesday that the child still facesconsiderable difficulties.   ``Nicole will, in all likelihood, spend her forseeable future intherapy attempting to understand her traumatic past and make somesort of peace with parents who cannot cooperate,'' the judge said.</TEXT></DOC>
