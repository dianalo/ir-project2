The proposal was made by a newly formed company led by Robert B. Washington Jr., a Washington Bancorp. director who controls 5.4% of the company's common. He is also a former co-managing partner of a now defunct Washington law firm that is one of the company's debtors.    Under the proposal, Mr. Washington's company planned to offer $18 and one share of a new issue of preferred stock for each of the company's seven million fully diluted common shares that Mr. Washington doesn't already own.    Washington Bancorp. said its board concluded at a special meeting that Mr. Washington's proposal and other unspecified &quot;indications of interest&quot; to purchase the company were &quot;highly conditional.&quot; It said the board found the overtures &quot;an unacceptable basis for negotiations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
