At the same time, &quot;a significant portion of theindustry is not doing well at all, and a significant portionin the middle is being drawn towards the two extremes&quot; asrising competition separates the strong from the weak, hesaid.</LP><TEXT>   The disparate fortunes facing banks complicates a majordecision facing the FDIC: How much should it increase thepremiums that banks pay on deposits to sustain the BankInsurance Fund. That rate is currently 23 cents per $100 ofdomestic deposits. Mr. Taylor has recently hinted that therate is likely to go up, perhaps to as high as 30 cents. Manybanks say any increase would restrict their ability to lendand would hurt the economy. They also question whether anincrease is necessary to meet the continuing costs of bankfailures.   In remarks to the same meeting, David Mullins, vicechairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said a sharp increasein insurance premiums would hurt the banking industry andperhaps contribute to the failure of weak banks. He calledcurrent premiums an &quot;enormous burden&quot; on banks and said theFed is trying to participate in the FDIC's deliberations withdiscussions of the impact of a premium boost.   Before his speech, Mr. Taylor said the FDIC would considerthe premium issue in two weeks or so. Some analysts at theAmerican Bankers Association and elsewhere fear that thecomparative strength of the healthy part of the industry willmake it easier for the FDIC to seek a large boost effectiveJune 30 on the Robin Hoodlike theory that profitable banksare in a good position to supply funds needed to close sickbanks.   Separately, the Comptroller of the Currency proposed a 27%to 30% increase in assessments it charges 3,900 nationallychartered banks to cover the cost of bank examinations. Ifthe proposal is adopted after a month of public comment, thehigher fees would take effect with the semiannual payment dueJuly 31.   Under the proposal, a bank with assets of $100 millionwould see its semiannual assessment rise $4,539, to $20,151.A $1 billion bank would pay $23,426 more, or $103,225, andthe semiannual payment for a $40 billion bank would rise$521,745 to $2,277,682, according to the comptroller'sfigures. The higher assessments will pay the cost of hiring600 additional field examiners over the next two years toallow the comptroller's office to examine every bankannually, as required by a new banking law. Officials in thecomptroller's office estimate the agency won't have to boostassessments again until 1995, although changes in bankingconditions could move that date.   In his speech, Mr. Taylor said that commercial bankprofits for 1991 would be slightly higher than last year,when the FDIC reported profits of $16.6 billion. Looked at inother terms, the return on bank assets will be about 0.55% to0.56% for last year, up from 0.50% in 1990, he said.   But he said that results will vary widely. Of the nation's50 largest banking companies, for instance, 15 will have areturn on assets of 1% or more -- a strong showing -- while11 had losses.   Mr. Taylor said that the FDIC's &quot;view of the future iskind of a mix of hope and of skepticism, hope that the repairof the system is under way, but skepticism that our need todeal with specific problems will diminish in the near term.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
