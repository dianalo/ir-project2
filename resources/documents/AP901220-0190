Fundamental changes are under way, and about all that can besaid about them is that they will deeply affect the way peoplelive, for better or worse.   Business is reassessing its employment practices, and chancesare that more people will lose their jobs. Interest rates arefalling, which will benefit many but undermine the plans of thosewho live off interest payments.   Some of the banks are in trouble. Many insurers also are likelyto face difficult decisions about writing off assets. Lots of smallbusinesses are likely to fail over the next few months. Bigger onesmight have to cut dividends.   Perhaps the only people who claim to like uncertainty are thosewho believe they can benefit from it. To them, change isopportunity, but even they doubt, because experience shows thatmany will reach for the brass ring - and miss it.   Grim as the current changes may seem, however, no Americanshould forget the bigger picture. Give yourself a Christmas giftand think about it.   -Economic downturns are natural and inevitable. No powersinvented by humankind have ever been able to keep economies fromups and downs, and probably that is a good thing.   -The American economy has always recovered from recessions andcome back bigger and stronger and usually healthier than before.That's not theory, but fact.   -Downturns correct imbalances. Not all of them, but they do tendto set many things ``straight'' that should have been correctedearlier.   Workers, for example, become more dedicated, businesses moreproductive. Waste is reduced. Solid values are reaffirmed.   There is a tendency during upturns to throw away the oldguidelines and believe that humankind has entered a new era ofaffluence. Old disciplines are trampled; their believers arescorned.   When the downturn comes, the old anchors of behavior, generallyhealthier and more productive ones, are reinstated - for a while,anyway.   -Downturns, and the corrections they force upon us, are thefoundations of economic ascents. The pain that recessions bringgenerally is not wasted, but remains as a constructive lesson to beremembered when times improve.   Nobody can say how long these bad times will last. That issimply an uncertainty that people must live with. But recessionslasting more than a year have become rarer, in part because we knowwhat actions to take against them.   Those actions already are under way. The Federal Reserve, whichhas been unusually cautious about allowing funds to flow into theeconomy, has now eased the pressure. Interest rates are falling.Inflation is down.   There will be immediate relief for some financial institutions,businesses and people. Home mortgage rates, especially variablerates but also new fixed-rate loans, already are less expensive.They will become more so.   Banks, with help from regulators, will be getting their affairsin order. They will be writing off non-performing loans; they willbe making deals with their hard-pressed business customers thatwill help those customers survive.   Viewed from a certain perspective, a rosy one perhaps, theprocess of recovery is already beginning, although it might take along while to produce much evidence. Old business and old notionsare being cleared from the books.   Those who say they know when the economy will improve again areprobably talking nonsense at this point. But judging from the past,there is evidence to support the notion that when the gloom isdeepest the worst may be over.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, Dec. 21</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
