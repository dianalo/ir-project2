PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Latvia's legislature ended a special sessionTuesday without voting on a populist organization's demand forautonomy in the Baltic republic, activists reported.   The same question came up in Lithuania's legislature last Fridayand no vote was taken, but Estonia's legislature approved a``declaration of sovereignty'' on Nov. 16 along with aconstitutional amendment declaring the republic autonomous in allareas except defense and foreign policy.   Janis Dinevich said the Latvian legislators took no action onproposed changes in the Latvian constitution. He serves on thegoverning council of the Latvian People's Front, which has pushedfor autonomy.   ``In principle, they didn't touch the republican constitution,''Dinevich said by telephone. ``They're not looking at the republicanconstitution.''   He said leaders of the People's Front would meet ``very, verysoon'' to plan a response.   In the Caucasus, site of a long territorial dispute between therepublics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Kremlin's representativehalted an Armenian legislative session Tuesday because of ethnictension caused by protests in Azerbaijan, official reports said.   Arkady Volsky, sent by the Kremlin to oversee its policy in thearea, flew immediately to Stepanakert, capital of theNagorno-Karabakh region claimed by both republics, said an editor ofthe official Armenpress news agency.   Ethnic rioting in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, last February cost thelives of at least 32 people.   Commissions of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, havesaid the Estonian constitutional amendment violates the nationalconstitution. National newspapers have accused Estonian andLithuanian activists of causing ethnic tension.   Exactly what Latvia's legislature did in its 12-hour session wasunclear to those who listened on live broadcasts.   ``Except for the best lawyers in the republic, no one can say,''said Andrei Tsirulis, editor of the youth newspaper PadomjuJaunatne. Tsirulis said by telephone from Riga, the capital, hewould have to wait for official reports released in the morning tofind out what the legislators approved.   Mikhail Bombin, correspondent for the Moscow human rights journalExpress-Khronika, said Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov told thelegislature there was no need to vote on greater autonomy because ofchanges being made in proposed amendments to the Soviet constitution.   Dozens of people supporting autonomy gathered outside thelegislative chamber, Bombin said.   Activists in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have demanded greatereconomic and cultural freedom under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'splan for increased local control. The three Baltic republics wereindependent between the world wars, but the Soviet Union took themover in 1940 under an agreement with Nazi Germany.   Baltic activists claim proposed amendments to the Sovietconstitution will reduce local authority rather than increasing it.   Those reporting on Tuesday's developments said the legislatureapproved proposals for changes to those amendments but the detailswere not made clear during the live broadcast.   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, continued its criticism ofPeople's Front groups in the Baltic states, warning Lithuanianactivists Tuesday that ``democracy without responsibility can turninto evil.''   It said leaders of Sajudis, the Lithuanian group, ``are notafraid to verbally abuse separate individuals and the authorities orpaint or print posters which have no other aim than provocation.''   A special commission of the national parliament has recommendedsome changes in amendments proposed by Gorbachev to limit powers ofa new national council, which originally would have been able tostrike down laws adopted by the legislatures of the 15 Sovietrepublics.   Tsirulis said the People's Front of Latvia had asked thelegislators in Riga to take legal measures ``so the republic willhave sovereignty inside the Soviet Union.''   ``The Latvian people support the proposals of the People's Frontand want them adopted,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
