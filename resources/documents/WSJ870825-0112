The preliminary decision on two trade complaints filed by Carrollton, Ga.-based Southwire Co. means that the Commerce Department will continue to investigate charges that the imports are violating the U.S. anti-dumping act and the countervailing duty law.    ITC officials said the imports from Venezuela totaled about $61.5 million last year. Major uses of the wire drawn from aluminum rods include electric power transmission lines and industrial machinery.    Southwire said the Venezuelan government has been providing large subsidies to aluminum rod producers and exporters in violation of the U.S. countervailing duty law. In addition, it accused Venezuelan producers of exporting the electrical-conductor aluminum redraw rods to the U.S. at &quot;dumping&quot; prices ranging from 15% to 33% below fair-market value.    The Commerce Department hasn't ruled on either issue. If if concludes that Southwire's complaints are justified, and if the ITC upholds its finding that the imports are injuring a domestic industry, U.S. penalty duties could be imposed. </TEXT></DOC>
