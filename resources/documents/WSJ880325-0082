The publicly traded, leveraged buy-out pool holds 7.6% of Facet's five million shares outstanding, valuing the old offer at $120 million. Facet has more than 2.8 million shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants and conversion of debentures. Based on a total of 7.8 million shares, which Prospect said it expects to acquire, the new offer is estimated at $199 million.    Facet, a Tulsa, Okla., maker of auto parts and filters, declined comment on Prospect's new offer, which expires midnight EST April 6. A company spokesman added that Facet's board hasn't scheduled a meeting to discuss the bid.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Facet closed at $27.75 a share, up 75 cents. In national over-the-counter trading, Prospect was unchanged at $7 a share.    Separately, Facet said it amended a suit it filed last week in federal court in Delaware. The suit now charges Prospect with violating securities laws. The action seeks an injunction against the offer. Prospect calls Facet's suit without merit.    In December, Prospect disclosed that it held the 7.6% stake and said it might seek control. Facet said then that it welcomed the investment but considered a takeover unlikely.    Earlier this month, however, Prospect launched the $26-a-share offer, and on Tuesday, Facet's board roundly rejected the bid as inadequate.    Facet also adopted a &quot;poison pill&quot; measure designed to make a hostile takeover extremely expensive; authorized severance agreements with certain key employees; and filed suit, asking the federal court to declare Delaware's takeover statute constitutional.    That statute prohibits certain business combinations that aren't approved by the target company's board or by two-thirds of the shares not held by the suitor.    The amended complaint charges that Prospect's tender-offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission omitted and misstated material facts. The suit also calls the offer manipulative, saying that Prospect doesn't intend to actually complete the acquisition. </TEXT></DOC>
