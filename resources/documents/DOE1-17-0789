The free-energy change due to uniform boundarymotion can be calculated by path-integral methods from the distributionof the winding number of the paths around a periodic cell. This providesa conceptually and computationally simple way of calculating the superfluiddensity for any Bose system. The linear-response formulation relatesthe superfluid density to the momentum-density correlation function,which has a short-ranged part related to the normal density and, in thecase of a superfluid, a long-ranged part whose strength is proportionalto the superfluid density. These facts are discussed in the context ofpath-integral computations and demonstrated for liquid {sup 4}He alongthe saturated vapor-pressure curve. Below the experimental superfluidtransition temperature the computed superfluid fractions agree with theexperimental values to within the statistical uncertainties of a fewpercent in the computations. The computed transition is broadened byfinite-sample-size effects.</TEXT></DOC>
