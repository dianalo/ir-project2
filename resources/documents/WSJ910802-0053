In testimony to a Senate panel, William von Raab said hewas informed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady &quot;or hisdeputy&quot; that he would be denied any role in the investigation-- and in particular would be blocked from getting anyinformationeven though he had helped initiate the caseagainst the bank.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They felt that I was pushing the case too hard publicly,&quot;Mr. von Raab said, though he said he wasn't suggesting thatMr. Brady and his colleagues were &quot;opposed to pushing thecase with {customs} agents&quot; but that they thought he wasbeing &quot;too cooperative with the news, too cooperative withCongress.&quot;   Mr. von Raab's comments resonated with Republicans andDemocrats alike at a packed hearing before the subcommitteeon narcotics and terrorism. The Congress is stepping up itslook into how BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. was able tooperate in the U.S. for so long after several of its officerswere arrested for money-laundering in Tampa in 1988 and howit managed to maintain a secret financial empire in the U.S.that included Washington's biggest bank holding company,First American Bankshares Inc.   Mr. von Raab, now a lawyer in private practice, excoriatedthe Reagan and Bush administrations, and particularly theJustice and Treasury departments, for their failure to actmore decisively in their dealings with the bank, which drewin some $20 billion of deposits, regulators claim, through avariety of frauds.   A combination of &quot;government softness&quot; and &quot;influencepeddlers in Washington,&quot; he said, succeeded in insuring thatthe Tampa money-laundering case didn't turn into a full-blowninvestigation of the bank, whose losses are believed to havereached $5 billion or more before the bank was seized byregulators in several countries July 5. &quot;It was a realtriumph by the Washington power-brokering establishment,&quot; Mr.von Raab said.   Some of Mr. von Raab's targets accused him of exaggerationand in one case of fabrication. Mr. von Raab identified FrankMankiewicz, a Democratic Party figure and public official whohelps run the public relations firm of Hill andamp; Knowlton, asone of the influence brokers who kept regulators at bay. ButMr. Mankiewicz said in a statement he had never spoken ofBCCI to any authorities. &quot;Mr. von Raab's testimony as to Hillandamp; Knowlton is incredibly irresponsible and totally false,&quot; hesaid.   A spokeswoman for the Treasury also took issue with Mr.von Raab's account of how and why he was removed from theBCCI investigation. &quot;Information was leaked to the press,&quot;she said, adding, &quot;the prosecutor of the case called tocomplain.&quot; Customs remained a part of the case, she said, butinformation was held more closely, going only to the Customsinvestigator involved.   Mr. von Raab said the case exposed decay in the entireculture of the capital city. &quot;Maybe the BCCI case will be theone that changes this influence-peddling culture,&quot; Mr. vonRaab said.   Added Jack Blum, a former Senate investigator in the BCCIaffair: &quot;It was high-priced anesthesia. . . . The bank gotaway.&quot;   During the hearing, William Taylor, the chairman ofbanking supervision at the Federal Reserve, was asked whetherauthorities had a list of, or any information about, U.S.public officials receiving bribes or payoffs from BCCI.&quot;There is no list of individuals who received payoffs,&quot; hesaid. However, he added, &quot;we have a few instances whereexpenses were paid for people to attend conferences and alist of people as consultants&quot; working for BCCI.   Mr. Blum, the former Senate investigator, also said thatBCCI had made itself a significant player in the shadowytrading market for debt of developing countries. &quot;Third Worlddebt was a very major business for BCCI. It runs to billionsof dollars,&quot; he said.   In many cases, he said, BCCI was involved in swapping bankloans at a discount with developing country central banks inexchange for local currency at preferential exchange rates.&quot;The equity investment would be announced but never made andBCCI would illegally handle the conversion of the currency,&quot;he said.</TEXT></DOC>
