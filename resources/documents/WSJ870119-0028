The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed a 1985 lower-court decision, ruling that the FDIC rule doesn't conflict with the intent of Congress in the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial banking from the securities industry.    For the Securities Industry Association and the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing the mutual-fund industry, the decision was a serious setback. They have been trying to keep bankers from making deeper inroads into the securities and mutual-fund fields. </TEXT></DOC>
