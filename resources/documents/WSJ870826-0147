In fiscal 1986, the maker and distributor of television movies and series had net income of $3 million, or 57 cents a share.    Revenue rose 32% to $37 million from $28.1 million a year earlier.    Charles W. Fries, chairman, said the loss mainly reflects a write-off of about $2.5 million in receivables from purchasers of syndicated TV programming who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. There were also write-offs of about $500,000 for costs associated with an aborted acquisition, and about $600,000 for TV programming that failed to sell at hoped-for prices.    The executive noted that the company would have been profitable if it hadn't had the write-offs. He said no further write-offs are expected.    In an interview, Mr. Fries forecast current-year earnings of roughly $2 million, or about 35 cents a share, on revenue of between $45 million and $50 million. Mr. Fries also said the company is looking for acquisitions, particularly of entertainment companies with film libraries and executives that might complement those at Fries. The concern also hopes to expand its home video business, which it started in March, Mr. Fries said.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Fries Entertainment closed at $3.875 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
