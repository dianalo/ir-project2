(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Toronto businessman who bought PTL'sChristian theme park for $65 million says he is backing out of thedeal because of conflicting claims to the land from an Indian tribe.   Stephen Mernick on Wednesday said the claims have prevented himfrom getting title insurance on the 2,300-acre Heritage USA park andthat the dispute is an ``insurmountable barrier'' to closing thedeal by the Sept. 30 deadline.   Mernick bought the Christian theme park, resort and shoppingcomplex in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court sale a year ago after the TVevangelical empire's collapse in the sex and money scandal thatbrought down Jim Bakker.   Title insurance protects a piece of property from conflictingclaims.   Title insurers have been unwilling to issue a policy, whichMernick needs to secure financing for the deal, because of a claimby the Catawba Indians to 144,000 acres in northern South Carolinathat include Heritage USA.   Mernick sought a one-year extension of the closing to 1990 toobtain insurance, but the court and the PTL creditors who stand togain from the sale withheld a decision unless he opened his recordsand offered evidence that he had the financing to complete the deal.   ``I was fully prepared to submit to such an examination,''Mernick said. But he said the Catawbas' claims ``appear to presentat this time an insurmountable barrier to the closing of theoriginal transaction.''   M.C. Benton, a trustee appointed by the court for now-defunct PTLministries, was notified Wednesday that Mernick was backing out.   ``Heritage USA is still for sale,'' said Edwin Allman, anattorney for Benton.   Any sale would still be subject to court approval.   The claim filed in 1980 by the Catawba Indians seeks to reclaimland they contend was illegally sold to the state in 1840. A datehas not been set for the lawsuit, which apparently has halted othercommercial development, including a $100 million mall.   The $175 million theme park was developed by Bakker and his wife,Tammy. PTL filed for bankruptcy in 1987. Bakker is on trial inCharlotte, N.C., on charges of defrauding followers of nearly $4million.</TEXT></DOC>
