There was still a chance the storm might move back over the Gulfof Mexico and gain strength before returning to land, butforecasters said that would e unusual.   The Coast Guard today rescued six people who were forced to takerefuge on Petit Bois Island, south of Pascagoula, Miss., after thestorm prevented them from landing their boat on the mainland,authorities said.   More Louisiana coastal communities were evacuated as the storm,which had already forced thousands of offshore oil workers inland,drifted slowly along the Louisiana-Mississippi Gulf Coast.   No injuries or serious damage were reported.   As of 11 a.m. CDT, the National Weather Service said the centerof the season's second tropical storm in the eastern United Stateswas 50 miles west of New Orleans, near latitude 30.0 north,longitude 90.6 west.   The storm's highest sustained winds were near 40 mph, mainly insqualls in coastal waters, the service said.   Although widespread heavy rains were not reported at midday overLouisiana, officials said locally heavy storms threatened areas tothe east and southeast of the storm center with flooding.   Almost a foot of rain fell at Dauphin Island, Ala., in the Gulfof Mexico for the 24-hour period ending at 7 a.m. today, theweather service said. Officials reported many tourists leavingmotels in Gulf Shores on the coast.   More than three inches of rain fell on Biloxi, Miss., during asix-hour period ending at 1 a.m., forecasters reported.   Thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs wereevacuated Monday as a precaution.   ``We're on cautious alert now and we don't expect to go beyondthat,'' said Andy Valence, mayor of Grand Isle, a coastal townabout 40 miles south of New Orleans.   Homes were being evacuated today east of New Orleans in thelow-lying St. Bernard Parish fishing villages of Hopedale,Yscloskey and Shell Beach. Coastal tides were three to four feetabove normal, but were expected to reach seven feet above normal.   Beryl formed over Lake Pontchartrain and became a tropical stormMonday. It is rare for an inland storm to move offshore, theweather service said. The danger is that the storm will pick upsteam over the Gulf and come back.   ``Better this week than next week,'' said Bill Phillips, managerof the Republican National Convention set Aug. 15-18 in theSuperdome. The storm did not delay Vice President George Bush, whoarrived Monday to address the 1988 Platform Committee.   Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa said about 2,000 workers wereevacuated by boat and helicopter from offshore rigs to Venice,Leeville and Morgan City.   There were scattered power failures along the Mississippi GulfCoast on Monday and stores reported heavy sales of supplies likeflashlights and batteries. But weathering the big storms in thepast made some residents blase.   ``We went through Camille, Elena and Frederic,'' said JeanWilson of Biloxi, Miss. ``This is too small to worry about.''   Hotel guests on the Alabama Gulf Coast, however, startedchecking out in droves as the stormy weather came Monday. ``Weexperienced a 50 percent drop in business,'' said Steve Bergeron,manager of the Holiday Inn in Gulf Shores.   A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its windshit 39 mph and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph.   The last major Gulf Coast hurricane was Camille in 1969, whichpacked 218 mph winds. It killed 320 people and did millions indamage. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November30 with August and September the most active months.</TEXT></DOC>
