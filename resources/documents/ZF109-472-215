(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>King Jaguar: The SequelandM;In the February issue we wanted to compare spreadsheet compilers King Jaguarfrom Sheng Labs and Baler from Baler Software Corp., but King Jaguar wasn'tquite ready for prime time.andP;  The program failed to compile several of ourtest worksheets.andP;  Therefore, we had no choice but to recommend Baler andpromise to review King Jaguar as soon as the publisher addressed itsproblems.andM;Now King Jaguar is repaired, and we can offer the following recommendation:To create the fastest stand-alone applications from your macro-basedworksheets, choose King Jaguar.andP;  Unlike Baler, King Jaguar compiles macrosinto programs that run much faster than their 1-2-3 counterparts; it has abuilt-in macro debugger, which makes it easy to pinpoint problems in a macro;and it lets you integrate C and assembly-language applications into yourcompiled application.andM;If macro performance isn't important, Baler is your best bet.andP;  It compilesformula-based worksheets much more quickly than King Jaguar.andP;  It can alsocompile some worksheets--especially large, text-based worksheets--thatcontinue to stump King Jaguar.andP;  BalerXE, which Baler Software released inJune, lets you integrate C, assembly-language, and BASIC applications, but itcosts $300 more than Baler 5.0 and $200 more than King Jaguar.andM;Macros and performanceandM;It's a shame that King Jaguar's macro debugger isn't available separatelyfrom the compiler, because it can spare any macro programmer hours ofrepetitive testing.andP;  Like 1-2-3's Step mode and Baker 5.0's step-modedebugger, King Jaguar's macro debugger lets you execute a macro, one commandat a time.andP;  But the King Jaguar debugger adds much more.andP;  For example, itlets you specify one or more break points that cause macro execution to haltautomatically.andP;  You can also designate up to four watch points--cells whosevalues you can check throughout debugging.andP;  And you can display a list of themacro subroutines that have been called by the macro you're debugging, makingit easier to verify the flow of your macro program.andM;In our tests, macro-based worksheets compiled with King Jaguar ran two to sixtimes faster than their 1-2-3 counterparts and up to seven times faster thanthe same worksheets compiled with Baler.andP;  In general, King Jaguar posted thegreatest speed gains when compiling macros that performed raw calculations ordata manipulation.andP;  It achieved smaller gains when compiling macros thatwrote new data to the worksheet or altered the screen display.andM;King Jaguar compiles macro-based worksheets about as quickly as Baler, but itis much slower at compiling formula-based worksheets.andP;  It took King Jaguaralmost 40 minutes to compile a formula-based amortization worksheet thatBaler compiled in just over 2 minutes.andP;  And keep in mind that you usuallyhave to compile a worksheet several times before you get it right.andM;Like Baler, King Jaguar can use expanded memory or disk space to compileworksheets.andP;  Applications compiled with King Jaguar, like theirBaler--compiled counterparts, can use expanded memory or disk space as extramemory when needed, at the expense of recalculation speed.andP;  However, it'sworth noting that in each of our comparisons, the application compiled withKing Jaguar required less memory than the same application compiled withBaler.andP;  That's especially important if you create large applications forusers who don't have expanded memory--recalculation speed slows dramaticallywhen an application uses disk space as additional memory.andM;The revamped King Jaguar successfully compiled almost all the worksheets inour tests, with just two exceptions.andP;  It still could not compile the3,500-record database application tested in our February review (page 84).andO;The program's manufacturer admitted that King Jaguar was not designed tocompile files containing a lot of text strings.andP;  It also failed to compile a1.2-megabyte, macro-driven energy-audit worksheet.andP;  Baler 5.0 compiled bothwith case.andM;The remaining differences between the two compilers are more subtle.andP;  Forexample, Baler lets you specify which cells can be changed by keyboard inputor macro input, or you can determine which cells cannot be changed at all;King Jaguar offers no such control.andP;  And while both programs let you compileworksheets into applications that can accept new rows of data, King Jaguarrequires that you anticipate the last row and protect it before compiling--adetail that can be especially exasperating if you remember it only after youcompile.andM;Both programs let you customize your compiled program's appearance withcontext-sensitive help screens, pop-up and pull-down menus, colors, shading,and straight-line borders.andP;  With King Jaguar, setting up both custom menusand anything but the simplest color combinations requires the use of specialmacro commands.andP;  Baler has a special module that makes customizing menus andcolors easier, but King Jaguar's line-drawing and shading tools are mucheasier to use than Baler's.andM;IN BRIEFandM;King Jaguar 2.2.andP;
