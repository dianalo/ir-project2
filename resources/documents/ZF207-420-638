(Chief Information Officer)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Cashin, Jerry.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>MIS and DP departments are likely to include dual paths at leastthrough 1994, says Dale Kutnick, president of Meta Group Incconsulting firm.andP;  One path includes creation of a chiefinformation officer position, responsible for seekingopportunities to maximize business advantage, assessing variousinformation systems that might be integrated into the business,and performing analyses intended to help position the company tothe best strategic advantage.andP;  The other path involves dailyimplementation and operation of equipment as well as makingdetailed technological decisions.andP;  A variety of connectivitystandards face the decision-maker.andP;  Among them are OSI, includingFtam file transfer and X.400 electronic mail standards; CCITTX.500; ISDN; and IEEE local area network standards such asEthernet, Token Ring, and the token bus.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MISManagementFuture of ComputingChief Information OfficersComputer Systems IntegratorsData ProcessingStandards.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Divided Paths for MISandM;Experts make predictions ranging all the way from the imminent demise ofDP/MIS to the ultimate assumption of responsibility for the total corporateinformation resource.andM;Dale Kutnick, president of Stamford, Conn.-based consultant Meta Group Inc.,andO;speaks of another possibility for DP/MIS, &quot;a bifurcated path,&quot; at least forthe next five years.andM;According to this scenario, the MIS evolution will involve on one hand theemergence of a chief information officer.andP;  The other half of the bifurcatedpath deals with MIS responsibilities in &quot;systems integration services.&quot;andM;This is Kutnick's theme in frequent presentations, such as the recent Connect'89 symposium in Boston, and the Solftware Magazine-Larry DeBoever conferenceon &quot;Managing DEC-IBM Integration.&quot;andM;The creation of a chief information officer position has already occurred atmany installations, although the titles may vary.andP;  According to Kutnick'sscenario, this post should be managing company-wide IS &quot;strategies,architectures, interfaces and asset management,&quot; in addition to theconventional management and administrative responsibilities of MISexecutives.andM;&quot;The CIO will look for business advantage opportunities, assess how variousinformation systems integrate into the business plans of the enterprise, andperform high-level analysis in order to position the corporation for maximumstrategic advantage in a rapidly evolving environment,&quot; Kutnick said.andP;  &quot;He orshe will still require sound technological capabilities, but will emphasizethe business side.&quot;andM;The system integration services duties involve the implementation andoperation of equipment &quot;in the trenches&quot; and making detailed technologicaldecisions, he says.andP;  Examples of these tasks include &quot;network and systemintegration, especially of local area networks, personal computers andservers, as well as distributed data across heterogeneous systems,&quot; accordingto Kutnick.andM;CONNECTIVITY OPTIONSandM;Kutnick predicts that MIS will be choosing from a bevy of connectivitystandards over and above the proprietary variety to work with.andM;He cites the ever-present Open Systems Interconnect (OSI), of course, as a&quot;tool for the future when operational products become more plentiful.&quot;andM;The Ftam file transfer and X.400 electronic mail standards are OSIApplication Layer services (important connectivity layers) which are justcoming into view, he said.andP;  In the short run, Kutnick says, though Ftam andX.400 were developed for an OSI environment, both may initially function inTCP/IP networks, now available as a de facto heterogeneousnetworking-standard.andM;Meanwhile, he notes that the CCITT X.500 technology is evolving as adirectory standard.andP;  However, Kutnick sand X.500 presents a problem becauseit was designed by a committee that included &quot;a strong element of telephonepeople.andP;  It is more phone-oriented and not totally harmonious with dataprocessing needs.andP;  That may need alteration in the near future,&quot; he said.andM;Kutnick also labeled ISDN as an important connectivity standard, but one thatwill not have an impact on the industry for several years.andP;  The key to ISDNacceptance, he maintains, will be user functionality rather than digitaltransmission.andP;  He added that the ISDN ability to support out-of-bandsignaling opens new vistas of software-driven services that are not yetvisualized.andM;In the near term, Kutnick said the most important connectivity standard isUnix.andM;&quot;A large body of developers and users are moving to Unix.andP;  IBM and DigitalEquipment Corp. are among the few who will support both Unix and theirproprietary environments,&quot; asserts Kutnick.andM;&quot;All connectivity software will function under Unix,&quot; he adds.andP;  &quot;Third partydevelopers are moving in this direction.&quot;andM;Additional connectivity standards mentioned by Kutnick include the IEEE localarea networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and the token bus, asimplemented by the Manufacturers Automation Protocol organization.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
