 We looked at Omnis 5 1.04 from Blyth Software, 4th Dimension 2.0.5from ACIUS Inc., Double Helix 3.0 from Odesta Corp. and FoxBASE+/Mac 2.0 fromFox Software to determine what was the new state of the art.andP;  The fourhigh-end, multi-user databases all offer new features that fix weaknesses inthe earlier versions.andM;A comparison of these products is a little like comparing apples and potpies.andP;  The best choice for one application may be totally inappropriate foranother use.andM;In this review, then, we've covered the features of these databases as wellas tried to get below the surface to find the subtle strengths and weaknessesof each for particular applications.andP;  A custom database can be the mostimportant piece of software in your business.andP;  If things go right, yourcomputers will make a real difference; if things go badly, a lot of time andmoney will be lost.andP;  We've targeted the manager who has to oversee thedevelopment of custom databases -- the MIS manager in a larger company or thepresident of a small firm whose company has an information management problemthat may be solved with a database language.andM;Same, but different.andP;  To begin with, let's get some basics out of the way.andO;Each of the four products reviewed here is good enough to be considered foryour applications.andP;  They are all multi-user, relational database developmentenvironments that can be programmed to do specific tasks and handle a largeamount of data in complex structures.andM;Each of them can be put to work quickly for simple applications with minimalprogramming.andP;  Their real function, however, is in developing custom systems.andO;They all have the features needed to design screens and reports with aMacintosh look (including various text styles and sizes, graphics andcolors), as well as a Macintosh feel (with push buttons, check boxes, radiobuttons and menus).andP;  They all include drawing environments for designingscreens and reports, and allow bit-mapped graphics from other applications tobe placed into those layouts.andM;In fact, if you don't take advantage of their unique features, it is possibleto design identical custom systems with each application that look and feellike Macintosh applications should and that are indistinguishable to a casualuser.andM;At the same time, each of the four is powerful enough to get a designer intotrouble.andP;  They all require a substantial amount of learning time even forexperienced programmers, and all allow bad data structures and inefficientprocedures.andP;  Any custom application in one of these languages also willrequire some creative programming tricks to get around weaknesses or bugs, orto give users exactly the features they ask for.andM;To set a baseline for the review, let's look at what is new in the latestversions of each product and the status of each product prior to the latestrelease.andM;Double Helix.andP;  Northbrook, Ill.-based Odesta's Double Helix has never gottenthe respect in the marketplace that it seems to deserve.andP;  Even its firstversion in 1984 included some innovative features that are well ahead oftoday's products.andP;  Helix's user interface is unstructured and highlygraphical, and it has no conventional programming language.andP;  Helix uses avariety of &quot;tile&quot; icons instead of text commands that combine inflowchart-like &quot;abacuses&quot; to create routines.andM;These tiles have turned a lot of people against Helix.andP;  Many programmers(these reviewers included) saw Helix years ago and panicked at the thought ofwriting hundreds of lines of code with visual tiles.andP;  Odesta's argument isthat with tiles you don't need hundreds of lines of code because the languageitself handles most of the work, and there's some truth to this.andM;Double Helix 3.0 is an incremental update, offering a handful of new featuresthat address some of the complaints of its users.andP;  New &quot;sequences&quot; let adesigner combine text-based commands (such as Close (Window) or Find Next)and screen-layout commands into scripts, which can be attached to menus orbuttons.andP;  The Helix desktop can now be viewed in a list by name or kindrather than just by icon -- a useful feature in complex systems.andP;  Version 3.0also includes some speed improvements, including more efficient searching inmulti-user mode.andM;Omnis 5.andP;  In 1985 and 1986, Foster City, Calif.-based Blyth's Omnis 3 was thepre-eminent application for heavy-duty Macintosh database development.andP;  Itincluded a procedural programming language with Repeat/Until and If/Thenconstructs, which were familiar to conventional programmers, and hadacceptable speed in a multi-user environ-ment with large data files.andP;  But ithad only token support for Macintosh user-interface features, and theprogramming language lacked some key capabilities.andP;  These failingscontributed to the Macintosh's image as a poor database machine.andM;With Omnis 5, Blyth has moved to bring Omnis back into the game.andP;  Theapplication has been substantially overhauled and includes many of thefeatures offered by competitors in the past few years.andP;  Screens and reportscan have the full mix of colors, fonts and styles.andP;  Menus, buttons, radiobuttons and other features are easily implemented now.andP;  Multiple activewindows can be programmed and handled properly, and Omnis 5 has bettervalidation of user input than its earlier versions.andP;  Omnis 5 supportsexternal routines, scrollable arrays, and text and graphic data fields.andP;  Newmemory-only files allow a designer to use more than the five memory variablesthat were allowed in Omnis 3.andM;4th Dimension.andP;  The release of Cupertino, Calif.-based ACIUS' 4th Dimensionin mid-1987 allowed, for the first time, a custom Macintosh database systemto look like a Macintosh.andP;  4th Dimension had several features not supportedby the competition, such as a simple report editor, graphing capabilities andsupport for external Pascal or C routines.andP;  These features didn't comeeasily, however.andP;  Even ACIUS staff described 4th Dimension's learning curveas a &quot;wall,&quot; and everyday tasks like printing mailing labels took many hoursof programming work.andM;Version 2.0 of 4th Dimension is a complete rewrite of the application, withthe goals of increased speed, better tools for novice users and a number ofnew features requested by developers.andP;  The data engine and file structurehave been entirely redesigned, giving significant speed improvements in manyareas of database access.andP;  Layout design tasks, like validating data entry,providing on-screen buttons for common actions (such as Next and Previousrecord), multipage layouts and control of the tabbing order are much easierthan before.andP;  For the beginning user, dialog boxes are provided to controldata export and import, label generation and simple reporting.andP;  For thehigh-end developer, the language includes more than 40 new commands, relativepointers to data and true memory arrays with tools to manipulate them.andM;FoxBASE.andP;  Perrysburg, Ohio-based Fox's FoxBASE+/Mac is a relative newcomer tothe Macintosh market -- the multi-user version was released earlier thisyear.andP;  Its design goals were speed and total compatibility with dBASE III,and it has always excelled in both areas.andM;But as FoxBASE lives by dBASE compatibility, it suffers by it.andP;  The dBASElanguage was designed long before graphical user interfaces, and programmingin FoxBASE is a far cry from what Macintosh users expect.andP;  To its credit, Foxhas done a creative job of adding Macintosh elements to the program, such assearch dialogs and a graphical forms designer, and it has extended thelanguage to allow Macintosh menus, fonts, buttons and windows.andM;Version 2.0 of FoxBASE is an incremental upgrade that addresses the loudestcomplaint of users.andP;  The principal new feature is a graphical report editorthat allows the user to add graphic objects and place fields on a report in adrawing environment.andP;  A variety of complex report formats are supported, andexisting dBASE III report files can be used by the new system.andP;  Other newfeatures include support for hierarchical pull-down menus, HyperCard'sexternal commands and some speed improvements.andM;Development issues.andP;  All these high-end products allow a programmer to designa custom application that can be used with little training and no knowledgeof what goes on behind the scenes.andP;  The development environments of the fourare worlds apart; your choice should depend on your specific needs andpreferences.andM;FoxBASE and 4th Dimension have conventional programming languages: Thedesigner types lines of code and has to type the right things in the rightplaces.andP;  Both provide some relief from the keyboard with mouse-based entry.andO;Omnis and Double Helix, on the other hand, don't allow typing except forfilling in values in formulas.andP;  Instead, the designer selects valid commandsfrom a list.andP;  This method keeps the designer's input under tight control andeliminates the syntax bugs that are frequently encountered in FoxBASE and 4thDimension.andM;Helix's tiles really are a programming language.andP;  Whether you program bydragging tiles or by typing commands, you're still telling the computer to&quot;find the records in file X that match the value in field Y,&quot; and the newsequences draw Helix down the slippery slope toward conventional, proceduralprogramming.andM;To support their languages, 4th Dimension and FoxBASE have powerful debuggingmodules.andP;  Omnis has none, and since it allows you to write substantialprograms, we believe this is a weakness.andP;  Helix has none, but since Helixdoesn't encourage large, complex procedures, it's not needed as much.andM;FoxBASE is alone among these products in offering a compiler for procedures;every FoxBASE procedure is compiled to P-code (not true machine language)after editing.andP;  ACIUS has plans for a 4th Dimension procedure compiler, to bereleased sometime next year.andM;There are many other differences, of course, and here are some of the keypoints that came out of our testing:andM;andgt;4th Dimension provides more tools than the others for accessing the guts ofthe Macintosh operating system, including serial port control,document-handling features and scrollable arrays of memory variables.andP;  Butthe power has its price: An inexperienced designer faces a long learningcurve before making good use of these tools.andM;andgt;Programming a Mac-like interface with FoxBASE can take much more time thanwith the other applications.andP;  Allowing menus to be active while a user entersdata, for example, requires some creativity.andP;  All the new FoxBASE featuresexcept the report writer serve only as easier ways to generate dBASE IIIcode, and modules haven't been written for all the things a designer wouldwant to do.andP;  In particular, we'd love to see a user-friendly menu-designtool.andM;andgt;4th Dimension, Omnis and Double Helix support the concept of &quot;events&quot; thatare generated when a user enters data and, therefore, allow data validationimmediately after each field is entered.andP;  FoxBASE does allow limitedvalidation, but it's difficult or impossible to do the kind of validation aMac user might ask for -- like overlaid windows containing valid choices.andM;andgt;Although all these products allow multiple windows to be opened by adesigner, only Double Helix and Omnis really allow the user to switch betweenwindows seamlessly.andP;  Helix allows two different windows on the same data atthe same time, automatically updating one when another changes, and Omnisincludes window events than can be tested by a designer whenever a userperforms a meaningful action.andM;andgt;These four applications have entirely different approaches to the concept ofsorting data.andP;  4th Dimension's standard sorting dialog box allows any subsetof data to be sorted in order by any field in the file.andP;  Omnis provides asimilar dialog box, but it can only be accessed when printing or exportingdata.andP;  Double Helix and FoxBASE don't allow ad hoc sorting by the user;rather, they require that an index be created for the desired sort.andM;andgt;FoxBASE requires more effort by the designer to manage indexed data fields.andO;The others maintain data indexes transparently, with no programming, butFoxBASE is limited to seven active indexes per data file at a time.andP;  Adesigner has to pay close attention here, making sure the right indexes areopen and being prepared to rebuild indexes if they weren't updated.andP;  4thDimension and Omnis have no provisions for creating an index on multiplefields of data together, such as a linking of first name and last name.andO;FoxBASE and Double Helix both support this.andM;andgt;4th Dimension is the only one of these applications that provides agraphical overview of the database structure, including the links betweenfields.andP;  This can be useful in a case where a designer needs to figure outanother designer's system.andM;andgt;If data security is important to you, you should know that FoxBASE datafiles can be read easily with any word processor, whereas data files in theother applications are much harder to decipher.andP;  4th Dimension, Omnis andDouble Helix include password security features.andM;andgt;Double Helix's Macintosh interface features are more limited than theothers.andP;  It has no provisions for check boxes or radio buttons on screenlayouts and no direct color support (you have to color an image in anotherapplication and paste it into Helix).andM;andgt;Double Helix has no capability to control the Macintosh serial ports, whichis a problem if you need to control devices like fast, serial, line printers.andM;andgt;If your system requires text-type data fields with up to 32,000 characters,take a careful look: All these programs support text fields, but FoxBASEcarries some old dBASE III baggage here and doesn't handle them well.andP;  Theyall support storing graphic images in data fields.andM;andgt;Omnis 5 and 4th Dimension 2.0 are wholly new versions and provide utilitiesto convert old systems to the new version.andP;  But to take advantage of newfeatures you'll have to do some rewriting, and some of the tricks you mighthave used in the past may not work properly in the new versions.andP;  Expect torewrite maybe 10 percent of your older 4th Dimension systems and 30 percentof your Omnis 3 code to get them to work at all; more work is needed to takeadvantage of the new features.andM;And finally, all of these applications have bugs, although errors that crashthe programs are infrequent.andP;  Designers will run into many small bugs, likescreen redraw problems or commands not behaving like the manuals said theywould.andM;Reporting.andP;  Once you get data into your system, you'll need to get it outonto paper.andP;  Each of these applications includes a graphical report designtool.andP;  Simple reports, such as columnar lists with simple headers andfooters, can be easily designed by a user with any of them.andM;Moderately complex reports, including features like subtotals or recordcounts, also can be done with a little more work.andP;  They all allow a varietyof subtotal &quot;break&quot; sections.andP;  Various combinations of averages, sums anddata from different files can be easily included.andP;  Omnis' and FoxBASE'sreport writers are better than the others for this type of report, since theyrequire less programming.andM;However, all report writing tools have their limits for sophisticated orunusual printouts.andP;  Creative programming tricks are needed when the built-infeatures don't do quite what you need.andP;  In these cases, the designer has nochoice but to jump in and take control of every detail of a report.andP;  In thisarea, 4th Dimension really shines -- a patient designer can control virtuallyevery pixel on a page.andP;  Omnis and FoxBASE both allow this type of reportcontrol but provide fewer tools to assist the designer.andP;  Double Helix is theweakest in this area since it doesn't provide any tools outside of the normalscreen design environment.andM;Two final reporting points stand out:andM;andgt;FoxBASE's report writer is the only one that lets you easily print reportsand labels in newspaper-style columns, wrapping from the bottom of one columnto the top of the next within one page.andM;andgt;4th Dimension includes, in addition to the normal report designer, a simplereport writer that can include data from multiple files and a simple mailinglabel generator.andM;Multiprogrammer development.andP;  If you're coming from minicomputer or mainframeenvironments that provide good multi-user development tools, you'll probablybe frustrated with a Macintosh database.andM;Neither 4th Dimension nor Omnis, for example, allow two designers to work onone system at the same time, and you can't make changes to the design whileanyone is using the system.andP;  Multiperson development and code libraries arepossible with these programs, but they require a lot of cutting and pasting,strong discipline and an additional layer of debugging.andM;With Double Helix, multiperson development and code libraries are simplyimpossible.andP;  No element of Helix can be copied to another place within onesystem, much less into another.andM;If these issues are important to you, FoxBASE may be the best choice.andP;  Sinceindividual FoxBASE programs and data files are distinct files on disk,multiple programmers can work separately and drop their finished modules intoone folder.andP;  Maintaining program libraries and common procedure files isequally convenient.andM;Speed.andP;  Speed is the most contentious issue in the database world.andP;  We'reintentionally not including a chart of speed comparisons in this review.andO;Speed charts may appear to be objective, but they can be easily and fairlycontested.andP;  Arguments over speed also obscure the more important comparisonsof the development environments.andM;The problem is that timing charts usually measure discrete activities, suchas sorting or searching, but don't account for real-world issues such as thesize and complexity of the entry screens and the amount of processing that'sdone on data as it's entered.andP;  Worse, these programs handle the tasks ofsorting, indexing and importing in fundamentally different ways.andP;  Forexample, the result of a sort in one is not the same as in another.andM;In the hands of a good designer, each of these applications has adequatespeed for most uses.andP;  A simple search on an indexed field in any of them canreturn a result in one or two seconds, even on data files with thousands ofrecords.andP;  But any of them can be brought to their knees by bad programming orother design problems.andM;Don't forget the hardware component, either.andP;  All of these applications likeas much processor speed and RAM as you can give them, both on the file serverand the individual workstations.andP;  If you want speed, you can buy it.andM;Database advertising needs a dash of reality, too.andP;  Although FoxBASE issignificantly faster than the others in many common database operations(searching and indexing, for example), it can be slower in others, such as aglobal update of a limited selection of records.andP;  In addition, the dramaticspeed improvements ACIUS advertises for 4th Dimension 2.0 are experiencedmainly when running a single-user database, because then changes are kept inRAM and only written to disk occasionally (a technique also used by FoxBASEand Double Helix).andP;  When running multi-user over a network, 4th Dimension 2.0is about 50 percent faster than the previous version for normal operations.andM;If speed is of primary importance, there's simply no substitute for writing agood prototype and testing it in a production environment.andP;  And remember, nosystem ever runs faster as it gets more data, more users and more features.andM;Reliability.andP;  Can you trust these applications to not trash your data files?andO;Silly question -- of course you can't.andM;4th Dimension, Omnis and Double Helix include error-handling features, suchas transaction logs and data recovery tools.andP;  However, they each hold yourdata in a file with complex, proprietary internal structures for storing thedata and indexes.andP;  Whether this causes you to lose sleep or not depends onhow much faith you have in the programmer and if you care about your data.andO;We prefer to back up our data.andM;FoxBASE is slightly less risky than the others because FoxBASE data is keptin fixed-format files, which can be inspected with a word processor if thesystem crashes.andP;  But we still back up our data.andM;Conclusions.andP;  If you've read this review to see which multi-user database wedeclared the winner, you missed the point.andP;  These are all superb products,and we're thrilled to see how much the new versions have advanced the stateof the art.andP;  But they're quite different products, and given your exactneeds, any one might be the best choice for you.andM;If it weren't for the learning curves, we'd recommend that an MIS shop haveexpertise in all these products.andP;  If that's not possible, give seriousthought to your customers' requirements, and choose carefully.andM;We have a challenge to the vendors: We'd love to be able to choose a winner,and we'll do it when one product really blows the others away.andP;  When you giveus the user-interface features and low-level design power of 4th Dimension,the speed and open data structures of FoxBASE+/Mac, the multiple windows ofDouble Helix and Omnis, the unstructured environment and innovative featuresof Double Helix and the seamless IBM PC connectivity of Omnis and FoxBASE,then we'll be happy.andP;  We look forward to your next versions.andM;David Beaver is president and Carrie Johnson is vice president of consultingservices of The Automation Group, a Macintosh consulting firm in SanFrancisco.andP;  To help with this review, they asked for opinions from a numberof other database developers.andP;  Kevin Monahan and Lenny Eiger assisted bydeveloping sample systems in FoxBASE+/Mac and Double Helix, respectively, andby critiquing the sample work done by others.andP;  Jeff Menz made sure we keptthe concerns of large, corporate MIS departments in mind at all times.andM;Many business owners buy a high-end database application for their own useand try to develop a system in their spare time.andP;  Despite the ease-of-useclaims of database vendors, our reviewers were unanimous in recommendingstrongly against this.andM;David Small, a businessman in Houston, nicely summed up the reason why: &quot;If anovice starts off with a major project like trying to automate a smallbusiness, the result will be one of the following: total failure and projectabandonment, hiring of a highly-paid consultant to finish (and usuallyrewrite) the project, or one to three years of painful learning anddevelopment while ignoring [his] business and therefore really paying throughthe nose.&quot;andM;If you really want to design a system yourself for the first time, werecommend starting with flat-file databases like Santa Clara, Calif.-basedClaris' FileMaker or Huntington Beach, Calif.-based ProVUE's Panorama.andO;You'll be limited in features, but you'll waste a lot less time, learn moreand have a good understanding of your real needs when you move up to a morepowerful language.andP;

 -- By Carrie JohnsonandM;The state of the art in heavy-duty Macintosh databases has come a long way inthe past six months.andP;  Totally new versions of ACIUS Inc.'s 4th Dimension andBlyth Software's Omnis, and enhanced versions of Fox Software's FoxBASE+/Macand Odesta Corp.'s Double Helix have changed the rules of the game in thismarket.andM;On the surface, all of these products are similar.andP;  The new releases havefixed the most glaring problems with the previous versions, and they're allconverging on the same feature/performance point: support for the full rangeof Macintosh interface features, powerful development environments andsufficient speed for multi-user tasks.andM;But inside they're still different products, and an MIS manager who wants tostandardize on one is faced with a tough choice.andP;  No one of these products isbest for every need, and all of them have particular weaknesses that couldcause a project to fail.andP;  The speed of each of these databases is roughlycomparable to the others, as well, making comparative benchmarks more troublethan they're worth.andP;  The quality of the development environment and theresulting quality of your code are far more important.andM;Ideally, you wouldn't have to make a choice: You could maintain expertise inall of these products, and use the best one for each job.andP;  But these productsare complex, and making good use of them requires months of learning andongoing practice.andP;  The time and money invested in putting one of thesesystems to work can be substantial.andP;  Choose carefully based on your specificdevelopment needs.andM;If your application requires communication between separate databases ordistinct modules, FoxBASE+/ Mac is probably your best choice.andM;Why?andP;  Applications written in 4th Dimension and Omnis create two files.andP;  Onecontains the programs and screen layouts, and the other holds all the dataand indexes.andP;  Double Helix has only one file containing everything.andP;  FoxBASEapplications have separate files for each program, each screen layout, eachdata file and each index.andP;  A FoxBASE system can use any of these files, evenin different folders, at any time.andM;If you're developing an accounting system that's distributed in separatemodules, it's virtually impossible in any of these systems besides FoxBASE togive your users only the modules they need.andP;  With FoxBASE, you can installthe new module and its data by simply dragging the files into a folder.andP;  Thisunique feature also makes FoxBASE the only choice for systems that require anumber of entirely separate databases that all get information from somecommon files.andP;  -- By David BeaverandM;While FoxBASE+/ Mac, Double Helix, Omnis and 4th Dimension all have similarfeatures, each has some particular goodies that the others don't even attemptto include.andP;  It wouldn't be fair to compare products based on these, but youshould know about them.andM;andgt;If you write many similar programs, you can write programs in FoxCode, anadd-on application-generator language for FoxBASE that will automaticallywrite other FoxBASE programs for you.andM;andgt;With the new Access feature, a Double Helix system can serve as a front endto a database on a larger computer without modification, using the CL/1connectivity language.andP;  Multi-user Helix uses a sophisticated database serverinstead of a conventional file-server design, which should give betterperformance over a network.andM;andgt;Omnis includes external commands for HyperCard, so stacks can access Omnisdata files directly.andP;  It also features a built-in driver for CL/1.andP;  The OmnisExpress application-generator language provides a friendly interface forcreating simple systems.andM;andgt;4th Dimension's External Areas let a C or Pascal program control a givenarea on screen, allowing you to add small spreadsheets or other customfeatures to your systems.andP;  Nice transaction processing features includecommands to start, commit and rollback transactions.andP;  4th Dimension hasconnections to Oracle and other SQL-host databases through third-partyproducts.andP;  -- By David BeaverandM;Omnis and FoxBASE+/Mac both offer compatibility with IBM PCs, but indifferent ways.andP;  When released, the PC version of Omnis 5 will share the datastructures and programs of Omnis 5 for the Macintosh, and the same customsystem can run on two different platforms, accessing the same data.andP;  Wecouldn't test this interaction, but you should note that this will not workon conventional 640-Kbyte XT clones.andP;  Omnis 5 will require an 80286-basedcomputer, running either Windows or OS/2 in at least 1 Mbyte of RAM.andM;If you have existing dBASE III systems, FoxBASE is the way to run those on aMacintosh.andP;  FoxBASE is virtually 100 percent compatible with dBASE III Plus:It will open any dBASE data file on a Macintosh directly and will run dBASEprogram files with few modifications.andM;The downside of this is that these converted dBASE III systems will look andact just like a PC on your Macintosh, with one font and virtually no mouse ormenu support.andP;  Converting an IBM PC system so it acts like a Macintoshrequires a substantial amount of reprogramming, and if you want to offerversions on both platforms, you should expect to develop and maintain twowholly separate systems, without much shared code.andM;If you need to access the same data from an IBM PC and Macintosh, FoxBASEdoes offer a version for XT-compatible computers, and these can share datawith a Macintosh system through a common file server.andP;  The DOS end can't berunning dBASE III.andP;  It must use DOS FoxBASE, since Fox uses a proprietaryindexing structure.andP;  -- By David Beaver</TEXT></DOC>
