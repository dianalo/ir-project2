In addition to being a major freight hauler of the Chicago andNorth Western provides the principal rail service for suburbanitescommuting to work in Chicago.   Under the Railway Labor Act, the board will report to thepresident in 30 days with its recommendations for settlement. Theparties are then required to try to resolve their differenceswithout a strike during the succeeding 30 days.   CNW officials maintain they could realize annual savings of morethan $50 million by cutting the two brakemen from current four orfive-man crews, which also include engineers and conductors. Theunion has threatened to strike Friday over the issue.   The White House said the National Mediation Board found that thethreatened strike threatens to deprive several Midwestern states ofessential transportation services.   The railroad employs more than 8,000 people and is the eighthlargest rail carrier in the United States as measured by revenuegenerated. It handled nearly 1.5 million carloads and more than 80million tons of traffic in 1986.   ``In addition to its freight-handling activities, the railroadis the major rail passenger provider for the city of Chicago,handling approximately 40,000 passengers daily,'' the White Houseannouncement said.   ``Alternatives to this commuter rail service are limited. As aresult, the Chicago area would suffer a substantial disruption ofnormal business activities, in the event of a strike.''</TEXT></DOC>
