(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Smirnoff, the vodka of czars that wasbanished during the Bolshevik Revolution, is going back to theU.S.S.R. as the distillation of ``all that is chic and fashionableabout America.'' What a country.   ``From a lifestyle point of view, Russians look to Smirnoff asan American symbol, which in a way is ironic,'' said Vivian Brooks,public relations director for Heublein Inc., which distills theRussian-born spirit.   Heublein, the Farmington-based liquor and wine company, istaking advantage of easing East-West trade restraints to shipSmirnoff back to the Soviet Union, where it was first distilled inMoscow in 1818 by Peter Smirnoff.   It's not like shipping coals to Newcastle, Brooks said. Smirnoffwill be marketed to compete with hundreds of vodka brands in theSoviet Union.   ``Smirnoff has really reached the point where it represents allthat is chic and fashionable about America,'' Brooks said.   Smirnoffs were official suppliers of vodka and liqueurs to theImperial Court until the family business was seized by the Red Armyin 1917, and proprietor Vladimir Smirnoff was jailed under asentence of death.   Freed by the White Army, Vladimir escaped to France and sold thefamily formula to fellow emigre Rudolph Kunett, who made his way tothe United States, set up his distillery in Bethel and sold out toHeublein in 1939.</TEXT></DOC>
