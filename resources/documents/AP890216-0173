About 1,000 people jammed into the downtown Cankarjev Domconvention hall in this Slovenian capital to hear party leaderFrance Tomsic proclaim the founding of the Socialist DemocraticUnion of Slovenia.   He told the founding convention the party would strive forparliamentary democracy and free elections and intends to competefor parliamentary representation with the League of Communists, theonly legal party here since 1946. Prominent intellectuals fromSlovenia were among those attending.   The party published its program in Wednesday's issue of theliberal Mladina youth weekly, saying it ``will strive for a peacefultransition from the country's single-party (Communist) system to asystem based on (Western-style) parliamentary democracy.''   His audience on Thursday loudly applauded Tomsic's appeal forSlovenia to seek closer ties with West Europe and its socialdemocratic parties.   ``This convention is important because after nearly 50 years analternative independent political party is being formed inYugoslavia,'' Tomsic said.   He said earlier in an interview with The Associated Press, ``As apolitical organization we will try to fill the vacuum created by theloss of trust in the Communist Party.''   At the entrance, party aides distributed party literature andapplication forms.   The party program called for parliamentary democracy, anindependent judiciary, private initiative, independent unions andlegalization of strikes. It said the Slovenian republic and all ofYugoslavia should ``link up with the West European political,technological and cultural integration'' process.   It demanded abolition of military courts.   Tomsic said Slovenian recruits should be allowed to do theirmilitary service in Slovenia and that Slovene should become anofficial language in the army, where only Serbo-Croatian is nowspoken.   Tomsic told the AP earlier, ``Europe's history has shown thatsocial democracy had done much more for the people than theCommunists.''   He said the party would be independent.   A short time later, Tomsic was summoned to police where he wastold that both the party and the convention would be banned unlesshis group joined the Socialist Alliance, a Communist-led massorganization comprising all social and political groups.   The convention went on as planned, however.   Asked if his group would join the umbrella organization, Tomsicsaid, ``The statute of the Socialist Alliance of Slovenia isscheduled to be changed in April and according to the proposedchanges the Communist Party will not retain the leading role in it.   ``If that happens, we will join the Socialist Alliance.''   A recent survey conducted by Mladina said that if free electionswere conducted immediately in Slovenia, the Social Democrats wouldget 35 percent of the vote and the Communist Party only 9 percent.   The rest of the votes went to groups now exiting only in theimagination, such as Christian Democrats, Greens and Liberals.   Yugoslavia, with a population exceeding 22 million, is apatchwork of six republics and two autonomous provinces. Josip BrozTito led Yugoslavia into the Communist camp in November 1945, butthis country broke from the Soviet orbit in 1948 and has since beennon-aligned.   Last Jan. 11, the first autonomous political group in Yugoslavia,the Slovenian Democratic Union, was formed in Ljubljana, but itagreed to operate within the framework of the Socialist Alliance.   Prominent intellectuals have called for the introduction of amultiparty democracy here, saying it would be the only way out ofYugoslavia's deep economic and political crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
