Just 20 miles from the Ukrainian border with the Russianrepublic, the complex covers a dozen square miles of theUkraine's second largest city. Its mission has been to arm aSoviet Union that now has come undone. Behind its high graywalls, management and many of the 20,000 workers -- fewerthan 5% of whom speak Ukrainian -- warn that too fast a rushto Ukrainian independence could bring economic collapse andsocial upheaval.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A wolf can live alone, but the Ukraine cannot,&quot; saysGennady Levchenko, the 42-year-old factory director. He seesa conflict brewing between the Russified Ukrainians from theeast, who work at his factory, and the more nationalistUkrainians in the west, who have been the driving force ofindependence. &quot;Declarations of independence can't changerealities. Only in the cartoons can a kitten begin to barkand suddenly become a dog.&quot;   But with each week, the barking grows louder. Ukrainianleader Leonid Kravchuk wants a national referendum onindependence to be moved up to October from December. If itpasses, the result could be the emergence of a state largerthan Germany in territory and as populous as France. It wouldbe the first truly Ukrainian nation, aside from a chaotictwo-year period of independence after World War I.   &quot;I would like for the United States not to be the last oneto recognize Ukrainian independence,&quot; says Mr. Kravchuk in arecent interview in Kiev. This week, he is in Washington topitch his cause to President Bush and congressional leaders.Ukrainian officials have been trying to win a commitment fromMr. Bush, who has thus far been cool to the Ukraine'sindependence drive, to recognize the Ukraine immediatelyafter the referendum.   But after Mr. Bush and U.S. National Security Councilofficials met with Mr. Kravchuk Wednesday, a U.S. officialsaid, &quot;We don't recognize unilateral declarations ofindependence.&quot;   Ukranian officials contend that independence is in theU.S.'s interest, because it could provide a hedge against apotentially unstable and aggressive Russia. &quot;If othercountries want a civilized and democratic Ukraine as theirpartner,&quot; Mr. Kravchuk says, &quot;we ask that they help us,morally, politically and economically.&quot;   The new independent status of Lithuania, Latvia andEstonia has encouraged the Ukrainians. According to Ukrainianofficials, more than 20% of Soviet nuclear weapons and athird of Soviet troops are in the republic. The Ukraine'sfactories provide 20% of Soviet defense production. Germany'sDeutsche Bank says the Ukraine's black earth produces morethan 40% of Soviet farm output, and its factories turn out40% of Soviet iron ore and 34% of Soviet television sets.   But for an independent Ukraine to succeed, it would haveto come to terms with a history closely linked to Russia's.Outside the Malyshev tank factory, Russian and Ukrainianworkers live side by side in gray, 10-story hostels thatoften provide only one room for four family members.   &quot;What difference does it make if we are Russian orUkrainian,&quot; says Vladimir Vassilyev, a Russian who at firstsupported the failed Soviet coup because he thought it mighthelp him fill his bare cupboard. &quot;You tell me what coup wouldbe necessary for us to live better and we will support it.Our problems aren't political, but economic.&quot;   Yet a Ukrainian friend of his welcomes independence. &quot;I'membarrassed that I rarely speak Ukrainian and my childrendon't speak it at all,&quot; he says. &quot;There wasn't any Ukrainianschool in Kharkov until recently.&quot; When asked what thedifference is between Ukrainians and Russians, the Ukrainiansays: &quot;We work harder, and take better care of our gardens,farms and homes.&quot;   The Russian standing nearby, Mr. Vassilyev, winces: &quot;Ifthat is true, it is because Russians have led a harder life,&quot;he says. The Ukrainian counters that his people havesuffered, too: Three million Ukrainians died during the civilwar of 1918-1920, and several million more died during thestarvation of 1931 and 1932. The Russian looks surprised,never having heard his friend recite this history.   &quot;No other colony in the world was exploited so much,&quot; saysValery Hruzyn, director of the Renaissance Foundation in theUkraine, which grants scholarships and internships in theU.S. for Ukrainian students, business people and others. Hesays 80% of Ukrainian grain has been shipped elsewhere in theSoviet Union over the years, along with 95% of the nuclearpower it has produced. &quot;What was left for the Ukraine was 5%of the electricity, the radioactive waste and Chernobyl,&quot; hesays.   It is Mr. Kravchuk's task to moderate the most radicalindependence demands of Ukrainians in the west and reassureUkrainians and Russians in the east that they won't suffereconomically. Yet strains are already growing between Mr.Kravchuk and Russia's Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Yeltsin's statementthrough a spokesman that Ukrainian borders might have to berenegotiated sent a shock wave through Kiev, even though thestatement was later retracted.   Mr. Kravchuk says that &quot;under no circumstances&quot; would heallow nuclear weapons in the Ukraine to fall under Mr.Yeltsin's control. Eventually, he says, he wants the Ukraineto become a &quot;non-nuclear&quot; territory. In the meantime, heproposes a complex strategic alliance with Russia, Kazakhstanand Byelorussia under which each republic would have a fingeron a nuclear button that couldn't be pushed without agreementfrom all. Control over the weapons, he told the Washingtonnews corps, should be wielded by the central government &quot;inorder not to unbalance the situation in the world and to calmdown the people.&quot; Mr. Kravchuk also views creation of a300,000-strong Ukrainian national guard as a top priority.   Mr. Kravchuk has rejected recent warnings by a visitingFrench finance minister against introducing a new currency,given that Western Europe is moving toward a single currency.He told the minister that the Ukraine must have its owncurrency to avoid being dragged into Moscow's economicproblems.   Ultimately, though, Mr. Kravchuk is a reflection of hisland's contradictions. He served as the Ukrainian CommunistParty's chief propagandist and then ideologist for more thana decade before making a skillful political transition tocampaigner for independence. He was mute during the coup butlater took the lead in pushing for independence. He is thefront-runner in the Dec. 1 Ukrainian presidential elections.   &quot;Throughout history, there are thousands of examples ofanarchists who became democrats and of democrats who be camedictators,&quot; he says. &quot;Without a doubt, I went through verycomplex changes in my world view, in my personal philosophy.I twice read all of Lenin. But . . . I must tell you howdifficult it is for me to accept that, because I actuallybelieved in all that I read. But those socialist ideashaven't been proved in practice.&quot;   He defends his ideological dexterity by arguing that theUkraine missed its last two chances to win independence -- inthe 17th century and after World War I -- because its leaderslacked political skill. But the opposition in the Ukrainestill wonders about his claim that he resigned from theCommunist Party on the first day of the coup. He did so, heinsists, in a letter that he refuses to make public. &quot;Thiswas an intimate and private decision,&quot; he says.   As he prepares for the December elections, Mr. Kravchuk isbusy mediating the very different views of nationalism in hiscountry. The feuds are characterized by the two flags flyingover the Parliament building: the blue and yellow of theshort-lived independent Ukrainian republic and thered-and-blue hammer and sickle of the Soviet Ukrainianrepublic.   The nationalist urge in western Ukraine stems partly fromthat region's short experience as part of the Soviet Union.It wasn't until after World War II that it was fully absorbedinto the U.S.S.R. Before, the area was variously part of theAustro-Hungarian empire and part of Poland.   The eastern Ukraine, on the other hand, has been Sovietsince 1924 and was part of Russia previously. In theindustrialized cities, nearly half the population is Russian,and almost all Ukrainians in the area speak Russian as theirfirst language. In Kharkov, the eastern center, more thantwo-thirds of economic output comes from the defenseindustry, and most of the rest from huge Moscow-run plantsthat mostly export to other Soviet republics.   &quot;The advantage of our connections to the union has beenguaranteed supplies, finances, employment and guaranteedsales of our production,&quot; says Kharkov's mayor, YevgenyKusnaryov. &quot;Now all this is in danger.&quot;   Still, the Ukraine has skillfully avoided the sort ofethnic violence that has infected other republics. That'spartly because its government hasn't imposed languagerequirements that punish Russians. Mr. Kravchuk has alsonamed Russians to top government posts and has granted theCrimea, a potentially explosive region, a form of autonomy.   A great many intermarriages also muddy the ethnic picture.Newborns have often been given Russian nationality, if therewas a choice, because it was considered safer. Even theUkraine's highest-ranking Russian, the deputy parliamentaryleader from Kharkov, is ethnically confused. &quot;My mother wasUkrainian, but they registered me as Russian despite the factthat I didn't know my father,&quot; says Volodymir Gryniov. &quot;I wasa child of a war-time love. Now I don't consider myselfUkrainian or Russian.&quot;   He looks outside his window at the Parliament grounds,where a crowd of western Ukrainians has gathered to shoutindependence slogans and wave the Ukrainian flag. &quot;There hasbeen no real national strife in the Ukraine until now, but Iam worried about the resurfacing of primitive passions,&quot; hesays.   Despite the ever-louder call for independence, theUkraine's old guard remains intact. Reforms have laggedbehind those in Russia, and the August coup attempt in Moscowdid little to flush out the most doctrinaire Communists here.&quot;This has been a land of political permafrost,&quot; says Mr.Hruzyn, of the Renaissance Foundation. &quot;Because it was themost dangerous place for Soviet leaders, it was also underthe tightest control. The sun needs to shine longer herebefore the permafrost melts, but when it does, our land ismore fertile.&quot;   Deutsche Bank has devised a complex ratings system thatdetermined that the Ukraine had the most economic potentialof all the Soviet republics. At Kiev's fashionable Maxim'srestaurant, Western businessmen talk enthusiastically aboutthe opportunities. A Canadian wants to take advantage of a$50 million line of credit extended by his country to fostertrade with the Ukraine. A Frenchman is looking for hiddentreasures in the Ukraine's defense industry, some of whosetechnologies may be useful in the West.   In his talks with President Bush, Mr. Kravchuk discussedWestern credits and said the Ukraine would be &quot;willing toaccept credits directly and use them directly.&quot; Over theshort term, Mr. Kravchuk told reporters, the Ukraine needssome help to purchase fodder, corn and soybeans to keep itsfarm animals alive through the harsh winter. Because of alack of storage facilities, he said, the Ukraine loses about30% of its farm produce each year. For the long term, theUkraine needs high technology to modernize its industry.   In Kharkov, the contrast between the Ukraine's politicalawakening and its ingrained caution can be seen at aspeakers' corner near the university campus, where a statueof Lenin, right arm outstretched, seems to be pointing theway to greater glory. The university's students don't stop tolisten. They learned long ago that it's safer to stay alooffrom politics.   Asked to reflect on Lenin, Anna Geisherik, a 20-year-oldEnglish literature student, simply smiles. &quot;I guess he playsan important role in this square,&quot; she says. &quot;You see, he isdirecting us to the public lavatories over there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
