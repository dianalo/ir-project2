While the dozens of Nicaraguan refugees arriving daily and racialdisturbances in the city's Overtown area had the Super Bowl hostcity's promoters fretting about Miami's image, community leaderswere more concerned with the threat of ethnic divisions.

Baker IIIdeftly sidestepped most direct questions Tuesday at his Senateconfirmation hearing, including queries about when the United Stateswould resume nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet Union.   But in his answers to questions from members of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, Baker made it clear that theadministration of President-elect Bush will largely adhere to pathslaid down by President Reagan, and will move cautiously when it doesdepart from those policies.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Doctors believe they can predict inbabies 6 months of age which ones are likely to grow up to have highcholesterol, showing that heart disease _ and its prevention _ beginearly in life, according to a report Tuesday.   The findings, which emerge from a long-running study inLouisiana, suggest that high cholesterol levels and high bloodpressure have begun to do damage by the time children are in theirteens.   ``Adult heart disease very clearly begins in childhood,'' saidDr. Gerald S. Berenson of Louisiana State University Medical Centerin New Orleans.   Cholesterol causes fatty buildups in the heart's arteries. Thiscongestion can culminate in heart attacks, usually in middle age orlater, unless it is treated by changes in diet or takingcholesterol-lowering drugs.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Medical research scientists are voicinggrowing concern that their work on behalf of humanity is beingthreatened by community activists unduly preoccupied with the effecton the people down the street.   The ``not in my backyard'' syndrome was debated Tuesday duringthe annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancementof Science.   ``In the cases I examined, the community wants to have someaccountability if there are any health and safety implications tothe research,'' said Sheldon Krimsky, an associate professor ofurban and environmental policy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.

The use of biological weapons _ deadly viruses and bacteria _ isgoverned by two treaties: The post-World War II Geneva protocol andthe biological weapons convention of 1972.   Citing Pentagon statistics, Barbara H. Rosenberg of the MemorialSloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York said that 10 nations arenow suspected of developing biological weapons, up from four in 1972when the biological weapons treaty was adopted.   ``Something has to be done to assure the international communitythat the treaty is not breaking down,'' she said at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</TEXT><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Charlitta Payton's roots are in the CatholicChurch, and she is not going to let the Archdiocese of Detroit closethe inner-city church she attended as a girl without a fight.   She is returning to Our Lady of the Rosary Church, for herselfand for future generations of black Catholics endangered by anarchdiocesan plan to close as many as 55 city churches.   ``When they become adults, all of their hope has been killedthrough things like this,'' said Payton, who had attended anotherneighborhood church that is not scheduled for closing. ``That is whyI was concerned about coming back to my roots.''   Our Lady of the Rosary is on a critical list of 25 parishes whoseviability is under question; it has a year to meet criteria set bythe archdiocese or it will meet the same fate as 30 churches alreadyordered closed by June.</TEXT></DOC>
