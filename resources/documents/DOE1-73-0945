The two prototypeengines built were designed using a modular approach that allowed easymodification or replacement of individual components without the needof rebuilding large sections of the engine. It also permitted each ofthe six partners (3 academic, 3 industrial) to design and manufacturespecific components with which they had the most experience. The firstprototype engine was delivered to the Royal Naval Engineering Collegein 1980 and since then has been comprehensively tested, providing datawith which to modify and enhance the original design. In the event, thisengine did not self sustain, but when these modifications were appliedto the second prototype engine, it self-sustained, thus proving the enhancements.This paper takes the form of an objective review of the design of the20 kV Consortium Stirling engine and assesses where certain componentsfail to achieve the designed requirements and where others surpassedthem. It also proposes further modifications that would enable this engineto become a viable prime-mover.</TEXT></DOC>
