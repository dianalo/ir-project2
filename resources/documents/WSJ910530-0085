But rather than dice, my hands held a turkey call thatinvaded the stillness of the countryside with a seductiveseries of hen turkey yelps and clucks. The past dozen or sotimes my calls had drawn nothing but silence. The sound ofthree turkey gobbles was as welcome as a roll of seven with amortgage on the line.</LP><TEXT>   Though it's a sound I've heard hundreds of times, thecalls of the tom turkeys had the usual nerve-rattling effect.Shaking fingers pulled a camouflage net over my face as Itook a seat at the base of the gargantuan tree. My pulse andbreath quickened as I tried a second string of calls. Theresponding gobbles were much closer than before.   My already-racing heart kicked into overdrive when thequartet of turkeys came into sight. The first three walkedsteadily, heads of neon red and blue periscoped to theirfullest from shining black bodies as they looked for the henof their dreams. The last bird, the largest of the quartet,moved slowly, strutting his finest pose as he walked. Everyfeather was on end, including wing tips that dragged theground and a fanned tail that made a nearly perfectwhite-tipped half-circle.   The experience had all of the suspense, intensity,excitement and natural beauty of a classic turkey hunt. Yetthe drama was unfolding in a less than classic setting.   Since the time of the Pilgrims the gobble of the wildturkey has been commonly associated with huge expanses offorest. Typical habitat included the rolling, heavilytimbered ridges of Dixie to the broad, brush- and tree-chokedcountry of southern Texas.   The land around this stereotypically friendly and pleasantKansas town is neither rolling nor brush-choked. It is mostlypool-table flat farm and ranch country of the finest kind.Planted cropfields and grass pastures form a checkerboardpattern that's uniformly divided by arrowstraight roads.Trees come in the form of small, scattered wood lots. Thinribbons of softwoods line the meandering streambanks.   It would be hard to imagine a landscape more differentfrom Dixie mountains or Texas brush country. It would also behard to imagine a more typical example of America's newgeneration of turkey country.   &quot;All of the old journals talk about needing thousands ofacres of continuous hardwoods to hold turkeys. But managementhas come a long, long way in recent years,&quot; said Rob Keck,executive vice president of the National Wild TurkeyFederation. &quot;We have turkeys thriving in areas wherebiologists thought it impossible for them to live only 10 to20 years ago.&quot;   &quot;States like Iowa and Kansas are shining examples,&quot; saidMr. Keck. &quot;In 1979, Iowa's turkey biologist wrote that heconsidered most of the state to be marginal to submarginalhabitat. Now some of those same areas have some of thehighest densities in America. There's one state forest thathas a density of around 100 birds per square mile]&quot;   The prairies of Kansas share a similar success story. Inthe early 1970s, a Kansas Fish and Game biologist estimatedthe state had enough habitat to hold a maximum of 8,000turkeys. Current estimates put the flock at a minimum of150,000 birds.   But the lower Midwestern states like Iowa and Kansas arefar from cornering the market on wild turkey expansion. &quot;Wenow have enough turkeys that we have turkey seasons in everystate but Alaska,&quot; said Mr. Keck. &quot;We even have populationsthriving in 11 states that are outside America's historicalturkey range.   &quot;The growth has been phenomenal,&quot; added Mr. Keck. &quot;Wethought it was phenomenal when the U.S. turkey populationgrew from 20,000 to three million between the early years ofthis century and 1985. Now we figure that the population hasgrown by over a million in just the last five years.&quot; A goodpercentage of those turkeys are in areas where it was oncenever dreamed they could even survive.   Much of the credit, according to Mr. Keck and otherexperts, goes to the intensive, sportsman-funded live-trapand transplant programs of state wildlife agencies. The wildturkeys themselves have cooperated by being as adaptable aswhitetail deer and nearly as reproductive as rabbits.   Not only biologists have noticed this rapid andunpredicted expansion in the wild turkey range. Hunters drawnby the siren's song of gobbling turkeys are now leaving thetraditional hardwoods and venturing onto turkey hunting'snewest frontiers.   &quot;Much of the non-traditional turkey country holds somephenomenal hunting,&quot; said Brad Harris, a legendary caller andcall designer for Lohman Game Calls, who regularly leaves hisOzark home to call turkeys in the prairie states. &quot;In someplaces you'll hear and see more turkeys in a day than youwould during an entire season in traditional big-woodsareas.&quot;   While some Eastern and Southern states struggle to getsuccess rates over 20%, many of the prairie and northernMidwest states see nearly half of all hunters tagging springgobblers. Since only a fraction of the excess males aretaken, every spring sees a continued rise in turkey numbers.   And the sport is benefiting more than just the sportsmenand manufacturers who supply their camouflage and calls.According to Mr. Keck, spring turkey hunting adds anestimated $600 million to the national economy, much of itgoing to economically depressed areas.   Here in El Dorado (pop. 11,500), turkey hunting gives thecommunity a chance to strut itself to outsiders. For thefifth consecutive year, the town has hosted the Governor'sOne-Shot Turkey Hunt, for which nearly 500 local volunteerspool their talents to offer invited guests the hunt of alifetime.   The 1991 list of hunters saw members from the corporate,sports, political and media world from all corners of theglobe attending one of the premiere hunting events. No oneleft disappointed.   Interestingly enough, the best is yet to come for the wildturkey population -- both in America and abroad. &quot;We feellike we still have about 50 million acres of uninhabitedhabitat to be filled,&quot; said Mr. Keck. &quot;There's also a growinginterest in other countries. West Germany stocked turkeysyears go, and we're hearing more and more from other Europeancountries. We don't know where it will all end. But I'veheard that when it comes to wild turkeys nothing willsurprise me.&quot;   ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance outdoors writer based inManhattan, Kan.</TEXT></DOC>
