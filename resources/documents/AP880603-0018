Gorbachev after fourdays of meetings, said Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary general.   ``This personal bond, we all hope, augurs well for furtherreductions of tension in the international atmosphere,'' he said ina speech Thursday to the Royal Institute of International Relationsin Brussels.   ``Things are moving in a good direction,'' said French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, speaking in Evian, France, after a meetingwith West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also praised thesummit outcome.   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, saidthe importance of the Moscow meeting _ the fourth for Reagan andGorbachev in 30 months _ went beyond the arms issues it dealt with.   ``Through this summit the American-Soviet relationship got a newstability, a new perspective,'' Genscher said in Brussels after heand other alliance officials met with Secretary of State George P.Shultz at NATO headquarters to hear details of the Moscow talks.   Shultz gave an upbeat assessment of the summit and toldreporters afterward that the superpowers had come a long way intheir relationship since Reagan first met Gorbachev in Geneva inNovember 1985.   ``It is an undeniable and observable fact that the relationshipnow is far better than it was at the time of the first summit,'' hesaid.   The Moscow summit produced no major arms agreements although twosecondary accords were signed, including one requiring at least 24hours' advance notification before ballistic missile tests.   The European allies are eager for Washington and Moscow toconclude an agreement cutting their long-range nuclear missiles byup to 50 percent. But they showed no outward sign of disappointmentthat Shultz reported only modest progress in this area.   Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, said the summithad provided ``a great measure of continuity and consistency'' inEast-West relations. This, he said, made it possible for thesuperpowers to work gradually toward more disarmament.   ``This is not a process of quick fixes, but at least there is aprocess,'' he said.   European officials who heard Shultz's report on the Moscowmeetings said afterward they were not discouraged by the apparentlyslim chances completing a new arms reduction agreement beforeReagan leaves office next January.   ``The firm will expressed in Moscow by both sides on (armscontrol) ... is an essential condition for decisive progress inGeneva,'' Giulio Andreotti, the Italian foreign minister, toldreporters.   Carrington stressed that Gorbachev deserves much of the creditfor recent improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations, particularly forthe Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty that the U.S. andSoviet leaders put into force on Wednesday. The treaty is the firstto eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons.   ``I don't think it would have happened without him,'' Carringtonsaid in an interview with The Associated Press at his NATO office.   He added that Reagan and the NATO alliance did their part bysticking to a ``twin-track'' strategy of deploying U.S. cruise andPershing II nuclear missiles in Europe while also seeking tonegotiate cuts.   Carrington also indicated that he saw little chance of Reaganand Gorbachev holding a fifth summit, since both sides have planeddown the odds of completing agreement soon in the Strategic ArmsReduction Talks.   ``There would only be a fifth summit if it was possible therewere going to be a START agreement,'' he said. ``I would havethought it doubtful there would be one otherwise.''   Genscher said that despite the long odds of a START deal beingcompleted this year, the Moscow summit offered new hope in allareas of arms control.   ``It seems important to us that both sides want to use the nextmonths to come to agreements,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
