A key feature of this demonstration hasbeen individualized management of a patient's health care needs. OCHAMPUShas worked directly with patients, families, providers, and funding sourcesto develop a coordinated plan of care that meets patients' needs at lesscost to the government. This process is known as case management and hasbecome a common method used by private sector employers or a third-partypayers to reduce the cost of health care for catastrophically ill patients.Over the course of the Home Health Care Demonstration, a number of beneficiarieswith very complex, high cost conditions who could have benefited from casemanagement were identified who did not meet the restrictive criteria ofthe Home Health Care Demonstration.In Fiscal Year 1988, Congress authorized an expansion of the Home HealthCare Demonstration that permits CHAMPUS to broaden the criteria for acceptingpatients and to include all CHAMPUS beneficiaries_military retirees andtheir family members as well as active duty family members. Project CoordinateAppropriate Resources Effectively (CARE) represents the expansion of theHome Health Care Demonstration. It is intended to be a highly individualizedand locally-based program that brings together the care coordination ofcase management with a greatly expanded provider and community relationsactivity not only to develop a cost-effective plan of care for catastrophicallyill patients, but also to identify those providers and military and communityresources that are willing and available to serve CHAMPUS beneficiaries,whether catastrophically ill or not.Project CARE will develop and evaluate a model for case management, beneficiaryand provider education, and appropriate resource utilization initiallyin a large urban area, a rural region, and a state offering significantstate-funded services.Although the statutory authority for this demonstration permits the expansionof the Home Health Care Demonstration in up to four geographic areas, ProjectCARE will be limited initially to three areas. The three demonstrationareas are the Washington, DC, metropolitan area (including the State ofMaryland, the District of Columbia and northern Virginia); the ``FitzsimonsRegion'' (including the states of Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, NorthDakota, Utah, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas); and Washington State.A CARE Office will be located at each military hospital located withinthe demonstration area. The CARE Office will be supported by a case manager(s)and staffed full or part time with a health care resource manager (HCRM),and clerical support. Where possible, the CARE Office will be collocatedwith the CHAMPUS/Health Benefits Advisor(s) (HBA) to promote coordinationof the services provided by these personnel.Under Project CARE, case management is a system in which an individualizedtreatment plan is developed, implemented and evaluated in the context ofa managed care system in the individual's community by a local or regionally-basedcase manager in coordination with the direct care system and the community-basedmultidisciplinary team of health care providers. Project CARE will providecase management services for high cost catastrophic conditions and seriouschronic illness with complex medical needs. Mental disorders are specificallyexcluded from this demonstration as they are being addressed through aseparate project.In coordination with OCHAMPUS, the Fiscal Intermediaries (FI) may contractfor case management services with a firm specializing in case managementand provide HCRM personnel support, or the FI may provide the case managementservices directly through qualified and experienced in-house personnel.The case manager will be community or regionally-based with a supportivenetwork for consultation, supervision, quality assurance, utilization reviewand data anasysis. The case manager will provide goal-directed activitiesthat organize, coordinate, and monitor service delivery based on measurableobjectives intended to meet the needs of complex chronically or catastrophicallyill individuals and their families. In order to accomplish this, the casemanager will be a registered nurse or similarly qualified health care professionalwith clinically based knowledge and experience in working with multidisciplinaryproviders. The case manager will have demonstrated case management experience,to develop a community-based treatment plan which best meets the patient'sand family's needs in the most cost-effective manner. In addition to identifying new admissions with catastrophic and seriouschronic illness conditions, potential Project CARE pataients will be identifiedthrough the following mechanisms:Patients who have reached the catastrophic cap.Cases identified through routine utilization review.DRG long-stay and cost outliers.Lengths of stay in excess of 30 days.Where the primary or secondary diagnosis indicates serious complications.Recurrent admissions or repeat admission(s) within a 60-day interval. When total charges are expected to be or are in excess of $50,000 per fiscalyear.A CHAMPUS beneficiary who otherwise qualifies for the Program for the Handicappedmay be transferred to Project CARE case management if the transfer is necessaryand appropriate and if the sponsor or parent agrees to the transfer. Patients will be accepted into case management when there is a reasonableexpectation that the case manager can develop a plan of care, includingall medically necessary services and supplies required by the beneficiary,that will be cost-effective compared to the usual CHAMPUS program includingcoordination of benefits with other health insurance. Patients not acceptedinto case management will be referred promptly to the HCRM for assistancewith alternative resources. If the case manager determines the case is not appropriate for case management,this decision is final; there is no appeal. The formal appeals processwill not be available for Project CARE since care will continue under theCHAMPUS Program and there is no loss of an entitlement as otherwise coveredservices are not affected.The case management treatment plan will be developed in collaboration withthe primary care physician, multidisciplinary team of the hospital andcommunity-based providers and the beneficiary or family. This treatmentplan will be developed utilizing a standardized comprehensive protocoland will be implemented in a timely and appropriate manner.Case managers may authorize payment for certain services, supplies, andequipment which are not otherwise covered when the alternative is cost-effective.Medical and other durable equipment is authorized when ordered by a physicianas necessary in the treatment of a beneficiary requiring transition frominpatient care to home or community-based care. Economy (rental versuspurchase) will be given primary consideration in reviewing requests forequipment. Equipment may be provided while the patient is still an inpatientif a period of training is necessary before the transition can be accomplished.Physician's services and case management authorized services will be paidas billed up to the prevailing limit, when available.Cost-share will be based on the patient's actual inpatient or outpatientstatus at the time the care is provided. All home care, whether or notin lieu of hospitalization, will be cost-shared as outpatient care. Cost-sharesfor case-managed services will apply to the catastrophic cap.Case managers will attempt in all cases to authorize care only from preferredproviders. If an appropriate preferred provider is not available, the casemanager will coordinate with the HCRM in attempting to negotiate a favorableprice on a patient-specific basis.In order to implement the program effectively, case management must besupported by a local resource serving as the critical link between beneficiaries,the military treatment facility (MTF), the civilian health care communityand case management. The HCRM acting as an extension of the Fiscal Intermediary(FI) field representative, will facilitate early identification and referralof beneficiaries who may be eligible for case management. Additionally,the HCRM becomes the focal point for those beneficiaries not qualifyingfor or requiring case management. The HCRM conducts community liaison withlocal, state, and federal agencies responsible for financing alternativeswhich our beneficiaries may be entitled to receive. This enables the HCRMto assist our beneficiaries with the financing of care not available fromthe MTF or as a benefit of CHAMPUS. The HCRM is responsible for knowinghow to access and utilize military and local, state, and federal healthand financing resources in the community. The HCRM is responsible for obtainingsigned agreements from preferred providers (those who agree to discounttheir fees for military beneficiaries) and participating providers (thosewho agree to accept the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge as paymentin full) and for maintaining and providing listings of these providersand resources to case management, beneficiaries, and the MTF comanders.The HCRM as a local on-site FI representative will work extensively withproviders to encourage participation and assist with problem resolution.Case management and HCRM should provide a combination which effectivelymanages resources through the use of a case management system and specificefforts to identify preferred and participating providers. This approachsupports coordination of services and resources with the MTF and the civiliancommunity. These strategies are intended to improve provider access, reduceadministrative tasks for our beneficiaries, increase beneficiary satisfactionand improve cost-effectiveness with emphasis on high-cost catastrophicand serious chronic illnesses.<ITAG tagnum="6">L.M.
