Doctors have stopped using antibiotics to treat the 87-year-oldmonarch's infected bile duct, said Kenji Maeda, the ImperialHousehold Agency spokesman.   Maeda said only that physicians ``believed it was necessary todo so,'' but news reports quoted palace sources as saying theinfection had declined and doctors were concerned about sideeffects from prolonged use of strong drugs.   Hirohito received another transfusion of 0.4 of a pint Fridaynight, Maeda said. That brought the total he has been given sincehis condition worsened on Sept. 19 to 24 pints _ nearly three timesas much as is normally in his body.   Kyodo News Service quoted unnamed palace sources as saying theemperor's liver functions were worsening and that the nitrogenlevel in his blood was three times above normal.   Palace officials said the emperor had not discharged any bloodfor two days, but doctors believed his internal bleeding wascontinuing.</TEXT></DOC>
