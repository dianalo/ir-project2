The company's commercial paper ratingwas also upgraded, to Prime-3 from Not Prime. This completesa review begun on July 16, following Kodak's $924 millioncourt-settled payment to Polaroid for infringing on itspatents. The rating action recognizes Polaroid's recentlyannounced use of proceeds, which will improve its capitalstructure, as well as the predictable cash-flow capabilitiesfor its core photography business. The rating also recognizesthat Polaroid's core business, instant photography, ismaturing and that new products within the segment may notsignificantly improve the company's financial performance.The rating agency is concerned about Polaroid's long-termability to successfully compete and manage the risks inherentin a transition from photochemical imaging to electronicimaging.   ---</LP><TEXT>   UNDERWRITERS RE Corp.
