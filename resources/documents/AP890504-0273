SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The typical American household, nearly sixmembers strong when the nation was new, is down statistically tojust over 2{ people, a record low, the Census Bureau said Thursday.   The decline reflects ``changes in the age structure of theAmerican population,'' said Census Bureau demographer CampbellGibson in a telephone interview.   The household is shrinking as families have fewer children, moreyoung people set up housekeeping on their own and the number ofelderly maintaining their own households grows.   There were 91.5 million households in the country as of lastJuly 1, the bureau said, with an average population of 2.62 peopleeach.   That was down from 2.64 people a year earlier and 2.75 people inthe 1980 census, as the number of households in the countrycontinues to grow faster than the population as a whole.   From 1980 to 1988, the number of households increased 13.9percent, while the population rose 8.5 percent.   Back in 1790, the first national census found that the typicalhousehold contained 5.79 people.   That was a time of extended families and generations livingtogether, circumstances which have become less common over time.   ``More than anything else'' sid Gibson, ``decline in fertility''has had an impact on household size.   Between 1980 and 1987, the proportion of the total populationunder age 18 dropped from 28.1 percent to 26 percent, he said.   The nation's birth rate fell from 18.2 births per 1,000 peoplein 1970 to 15.6 in 1987.   In recent years, there has been an increase in the total numberof births, largely a result of the giant Baby Boom generation beingin its prime childbearing years.   However, this generation is still reproducing at a lower ratethan the parents, resulting in fewer children per household.   ``Total births are still nowhere near'' what they were in thedecade following World War II, Gibson said.   This decline in young people is reflected in the maturing ofAmerica's population, a change emphasized on Wednesday with aseparate Census Bureau report showing that the nation's median agehas risen to 32.3 years, its highest level ever.   At the other end, pulling up the age, are members of thepost-World War II Baby Boom generation moving into middle age andthe growing number of elderly Americans whose lives have beenextended by improved medical care.   With better health, more and more elderly maintain households ontheir own, either as couples or alone, rather than living withchildren or in group homes for older people or nursing homes.   For example, in 1970 about 5 million people aged 65 and overlived alone, while by 1987 that had risen to 8.5 million.   In addition, many young people continue to set up housekeepingon their own rather than forming families as they pursue educationand careers.   In 1987, there were 6.5 million persons aged 25 to 44 livingalone, compared with just 1.6 million in 1970, census studies show.   Gibson discounted the effect of the rise in divorce andseparation on household size, however, commenting that detailedstatistics are not available to determine this result.   For example, a divorced couple may form two smaller households,may remarry or one or both may go to live with parents or others.   Family-oriented Utah was the only state with an averagehousehold size of more than three, at 3.17, the bureau reported.Florida and Oregon had the smallest average household size at 2.46.   The household measure counts the number of persons residing in asingle housing unit. This can be a single person living alone orany number of people sharing the home. The size of a household isusually slightly smaller than that of a family, since it includessingle people while a family must include at least two relatedindividuals.
