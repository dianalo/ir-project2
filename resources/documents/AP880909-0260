The Treasury's closely-watched30-year bond rose 9-16 point, or about $5.60 for every $1,000 inface value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and isoften an indicator of interest rate trends, fell to 8.97 percentfrom 9.03 percent late Thursday.   The 30-year issue was down about \ point, or $2.50 per $1,000,at midday.   Traders said prices were initially driven lower by adiscouraging government report on inflation.   The Labor Department said wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.6percent in August. If the August increase held for 12 straightmonths, inflation at the wholesale level would amount to 6.9percent, more than triple the 2.2 percent 1987 price rise.   Prices then rebounded slightly when traders took a closer lookat the inflation figures and noted that much of the August increasecame from volatile energy and food prices.   A lack of sustained buying brought another decline in bondvalues, but falling prices of oil and other commodities lifted themagain, traders said.   ``It was up, down, up, down,'' said John V. Sebastian, executivevice president of Clayton Brown andamp; Associates, an investment firmbased in Chicago. ``This was a real roller coaster day.''   Traders are awaiting next week's spate of economic data, whichinclude government reports on the nation's trade deficit for Julyand industrial production and retail sales for August.   The general sentiment in the market is that the reports willshow continued growth in the economy, which is bearish for theinflation-wary credit markets, said Jay Goldinger, a principal withCapital Insight Inc., an investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif.   But Goldinger said the fact that ``most players are sitting oncash looking to buy'' bonds has offset those prospects.   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-termgovernment issues edged up 1-32 point to [ point, intermediatematurities rose 7-32 point to 5-16 point, and long-term issuesgained almost { point, according to figures provided by TelerateInc., a financial information service.   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in theprice of a bond with a $1,000 face value.   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measuresprice movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturitiesof a year or longer, rose 2.45 to 1,145.98.   Corporate bonds rose slightly. Moody's Investment GradeCorporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, advanced0.66 to 289.19.   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.51percent as the discount fell 4 basis points to 7.28 percent. Yieldson six-month bills slipped 2 basis points to 7.79 percent as thediscount declined to 7.41 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to8.04 percent as the discount declined 2 basis points to 7.50percent.   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
