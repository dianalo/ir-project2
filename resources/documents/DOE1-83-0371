Charpy V notch tests have been performed to assess the toughnessof the material irradiated to various fluences up to a maximum of 5x10/sup19/ n/cm/sup 2/, E andgt; 1 MeV at 290/sup 0/C with and without an intermediateannealing treatment at 450 Cx168 h. The effect of the intermediate annealingwas evident. The recovery of the upper shelf energies was strongly enhancedby a thermal ageing effect due to the annealing treatment for all fluencelevels investigated compared to the irradiated condition. The transitiontemperature shifts exhibited a less straight foreward behaviour due tothe mentioned ageing effect which opposed the recovery process for thisproperty leading to a net shift increase at lower and to a net recoverybenefit at higher fluence levels. A phenomenological model descriptionfor the IAR embrittlement-recovery path is suggested. For this materialand these irradiation conditions a plant life extension (PLEX) may bebrought about if a specific annealing treatment is applied at a fluencelevel that is half the anticipated target fluence F for PLEX. In thiscase it was found that F andgt; 1.6x10/sup 19/ n/cm/sup 2/. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
