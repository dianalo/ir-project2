The actions were part of an agreement between theDemocratic-controlled Congress and the White House as Congresstried to finish a crowded agenda of spending bills needed before anew fiscal year begins Saturday.   The Senate was expected to vote later on the bill appropriatingmoney for the Pentagon. The complicated federal budget processinvolves legislation to authorize programs, followed by separatebills to actually provide the money needed to pay those bills.   The measure signed by Reagan is similar to one he vetoed lastmonth, but restores the defense spending priorities he requested ina veto message.   Because of that Aug. 3 veto, congressional leaders said theywouldn't vote on the defense appropriation bill until Reagan firstsigned the authorizing measure. The authorization and appropriationbills are virtually identical.   The bill signed by Reagan was approved by the House, 369-48, onWednesday afternoon. Three hours later, the Senate passed it, 91-4.   The measure authorizes the Pentagon to spend $300 billion in thefiscal year beginning Saturday, the same total contained in thebill Reagan vetoed Aug. 3. That represents a slight cut from thisyear's $301 billion defense budget.   The appropriation bill is for $282 billion in the fiscal yearstarting Saturday. The total is smaller because some of theprograms in the authorization measure are in future years.   The bills include a 4.1 percent pay raise for the nation's 2.1million uniformed military personnel.   While both bills contain the same reductions in Reagan'sproposed Star Wars budget as the bill he vetoed, the earlier bill'scongressionally mandated restrictions on internal spending in theStar Wars program were removed.   The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars anti-missileresearch program is formally known, would receive $4.1 billion,compared to the $4.8 billion sought by Reagan and the $3.9 billionauthorized for this year.   The Pentagon wanted to spend up to $330 million of the SDI moneyon a space-based interceptor weapon, the first stage of an earlydeployment SDI program. The previous measure would have restrictedthat to $85 million, but the new measure removes that limit.   The new bills also remove a restriction on flight testing of``depressed trajectory'' missiles, which fly relatively low insteadof into space as do other long-range atomic missiles. The UnitedStates has none of the weapons under development and no plans fortesting, but the Soviets are believed to be developing the weapons.   The new bills also rewrote the complicated spending plan for theMX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, two weapons at the heart of adispute over the future of America's land-based nuclear missileforce.   The original bill proposed spending $250 million each forstudies of the Midgetman and a railroad-based version of the MX andprovided another $250 million to be used for either program nextyear by the next president.   The new bills provide $250 million for the Midgetman and $600million for the MX-on-rails program, but say no more than $250million of the MX money can be spent before Feb. 15. The remaining$350 million could be re-allocated by whomever wins the presidencyNov. 8.</TEXT></DOC>
