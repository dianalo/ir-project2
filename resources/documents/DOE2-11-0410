The factors influencing the behaviorof these metals in throughfall included their concentrations in the incomingrain, the amount of foliage on the trees, the rain amount, and the stormintensity. The amount of metal removed from the canopy during rain increasedsignificantly as the residence time of the rain on the foliage surfaceincreased. Canopy mass balance calculations using independent estimatesof dry deposition suggest that the primary source of Pb in throughfallbelow these canopies is atmospheric deposition, while the major sourceof Mn is leaching from internal tree tissues. Both sources are importantfor Cd. 32 refs., 10 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
