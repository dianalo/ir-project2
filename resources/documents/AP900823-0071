Police ended their fourth dragnet of the summer today withoutcatching the shooter who has killed one man and injured threeothers since March 8 and has promised to strike again.   ``Operation Watchdog was called off at 8 a.m.,'' said policespokesman Hugh Barry. ``No Zodiac. Nothing.''   The Zodiac task force went out Wednesday night anticipating apossible pre-dawn attack by the astrology-obsessed gunman, whoapparently has not shot anyone since June 21.   This morning was considered key because it was 63 days from thegunman's last attack. The four shootings attributed to Zodiacbetween March 8 and June 21 have been on Thursdays at intervals of21 or 63 days.   Also of possible significance: the astrological sign of Virgobegan today. The gunman has vowed in rambling letters to police andthe news media to shoot one person for each of the 12 signs of theZodiac. So far, his victims have been a Scorpio, a Taurus, a Geminiand a Cancer.   All of the victims were men. Police believe the gunman hadsomehow learned his victims' birthdates.   About 50 detectives are assigned to the Police Department'sZodiac task force, and an unspecified number of officers workedovertime to help them today.   During previous dragnets for Zodiac, police posed as homeless ordisabled people to resemble the gunman's first four victims.   Each of the three previous dragnets cost the city $25,000 inovertime.   Detectives on the task force have tracked nearly 2,000 leads andeliminated about a dozen suspects since the case began.   Investigators, frustrated by the Zodiac's lack of activity, evenhave matched fingerprints from the city morgue against two partialprints found on the gunman's letters in an effort to determinewhether the gunman died.   ``I can almost say with certainty that if he died, his bodywasn't sent to the morgue,'' said Chief of Detectives JosephBorrelli.   Some detectives have speculated that the gunman has not struckbecause he is in jail on an unrelated charge or has beenhospitalized.   Borrelli said if the gunman were not caught today, the taskforce would probably be reduced to free up detectives to deal withthe city's rising crime rate.   Since the June 21 attack, the gunman has not written any lettersto police or the news media. Calls to the Police Department's24-hour hotline have trickled down to two or three a day, Borrellisaid.</TEXT></DOC>
