Sues To Stop Congressional Order on Gay Rights</HEAD><BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The District of Columbia Council filed alawsuit against the federal government Thursday, claiming that acongressional order changing a city statute on gay rights isunconstitutional.   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., attached an amendment to thecity's spending bill for the current fiscal year directing the cityto allow religiously affiliated educational institutions to denycertain rights to gay student organizations. Should the city fail tocomply with this order, all federal and local funds would be frozenafter Dec. 31.   ``We have been placed upon the horns of a dilemma by theArmstrong amendment,'' the 13 members of the council said in astatement. Noting that each member has sworn to uphold theConstitution, ``we feel that we would violate this oath if we wereto adopt the language directed by the Armstrong amendment.''   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court only after cityofficials were unable to persuade Armstrong to withdraw the measure,council chairman David Clarke said.   The suit seeks a preliminary injunction against the cutoff ofdistrict funds while the matter remains in litigation. Under federallaw, the city's budget must be approved by Congress.   The suit claims the amendment violates First Amendmentprohibitions against governmental establishment of religion andabridges First Amendment protection of free speech and associationby authorizing discrimination against gay student groups.   The suit also charges that the amendment violates the councilmembers' right to free speech by requiring them to vote to enact theamendment.   ``Never before has Congress been so coercive in dealing with astate or local government,'' said attorney Michael Greenberger, whohelped prepare the lawsuit. ``Here they're saying, in effect, `Ifyou don't do this one little thing, your government is down thedrain.'''   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who chairs the Senate appropriationspanel that reviews the city's budget, has advocated legal actionagainst the federal government.   ``I would encourage the district government to seek legal redress(from enforcing the Armstrong amendment),'' Harkin stated in aletter to Clarke dated Oct. 7. ``In my opinion ... this provisionraises legitimate constitutional questions about the rights ofDistrict of Columbia Council.''   The district's non-voting House delegate, Walter Fauntroy, saidthe lawsuit was the only action available to the city.   The suit ``is the legitimate exercise of the right of any localgovernment within the United States to seek redress through thejudicial branch when a significant legal question is at stake,''Fauntroy said in a prepared statement.   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. was out of the country and not immediatelyavailable for comment.   The city's human rights office had found Georgetown Universitydiscriminated against gay groups by not providing them rooms andmeeting space. The Roman Catholic school agreed earlier this year toprovide the groups meeting space and access to student funds onlyafter two courts had upheld the city's finding.   The university has stated it will abide by the agreement with thecity, despite the congressional action.</TEXT></DOC>
