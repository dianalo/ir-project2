But the insurgents, in the fifth day of their most ambitiousoffensive in nearly nine years, demonstrated remarkable stayingpower in other neighborhoods, repelling repeated army assaults orregrouping after setbacks to strike again.   Even so, the armed forces' air power and numerical superioritycombined with a lack of insurrectional spirit in most working-classneighborhoods to stall the massive guerrilla push.   ``What we have at the moment is complete control over the entirenational territory, and the terrorist delinquents have failed intheir adventure,'' said Vice President Francisco Merino.   His claim, made at a news conference, appeared somewhatexaggerated as the insurgents were thoroughly entrenched in severalzones in and around the capital and in the countryside.   Also Wednesday the government, which on Sunday decreed a stateof siege suspending most constitutional guarantees, tightenedlimits on freedom of expression with a directive sent to all localmedia.   The directive prohibits Salvadoran media from publishing anyFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) communique orthose of any group intending to disseminate FMLN activities.   It also prohibits ``publication of information from foreignagencies or countries that maintain a clear opposition to theSalvadoran government and people.''   The directive too obliges local editors ``to consult with theofficial source'' on any war-related news.   Casualty figures from the fighting were inexact, but surveys ofhospitals and a tally based on several sources indicated more than500 people _ including civilians, guerrillas and soldiers _ havebeen killed and more than 1,000 wounded.   Several hundred rebels, including two top commanders, were dugin at the northern capital district of Mejicanos. The scene inMejicanos differed from that of Soyapango and Zacamil _ otherguerrilla strongholds in recent days _ in that most Mejicanosresidents have stayed on in their homes, and many appear to bedecidedly aligned with the rebels.   Most of the civilians in Soyapango and Zacamil had fled thecombat zones by Wednesday afternoon.   ``Helping `los muchachos' (the boys) makes us happy,'' said anelderly man outside the local clinic. ``It would be better to diestruggling than let the SOB soldiers kill us with impunity.''   His words were punctuated by a U.S.-supplied C-47 warplaneflying directly above and firing hollow-sounding bursts from its.50-caliber machine guns at rebel positions.   The neighborhood's combative spirit was evident. Residentscarried pots of soup from their homes to rebels seated on theclinic patio. Young men asked for and received instruction in theuse of the rebels' assault rifles. Barricades blocked roads andtracks.   Facundo Guardado, a top FMLN commander, said the offensive hadone of two objectives: ``To oblige the government to negotiateseriously and responsibly,'' or, failing that, to topple therightist administration of President Alfredo Cristiani.   In Geneva, the International Red Cross called on both sides toarrange a cease-fire for the urgent evacuation of wounded.   Merino characterized the idea of a truce as impractical, andspeculated that the rebels might take tactical advantage of such ameasure.   Residents of some of the working-class neighborhoods north andeast of this capital where fighting has been the heaviest beganburning partially decomposed bodies in the streets.   Rebels opened a new front, in Merliot on the capital's westernoutskirts. They blocked the highway into the capital andestablished positions over several blocks.   But government forces counterattacked strongly with rocket- andmachine gun-equipped helicopters, heavy caliber strafing from C-47warplanes and hundreds of troops.   The rebels were pushed out after two hours of combat. But theyregrouped on the lower slopes of the looming San Salvador volcanoand shortly before dusk struck back at government positions inMerliot. Heavy fighting continued there at nightfall.   Heavy combat also broke out shortly before dusk in Zacamil, onthe capital's northern outskirts. Comunidad Emanuel, a smallshantytown, was set ablaze and a pillar of smoke from it rose overthe northern zone.   Ten rebels, looking tired and anxious, were confined to a rearalley of the Conacaste section of Soyapango. Their commander, atall lean man missing part of his left hand, said they had run outof food.   Juan Alberto Ponce, a 30-year-old construction worker, saidWednesday he had been trying to reach Alley 4, where his family washoled up, for three days without success.   Heavy fire from assault rifles, .30-caliber machine guns androcket-propelled grenades echoed deafeningly through the narrowalleys of one-floor cinderblock homes. Gunsmoke was so thick itreduced visibility to 15 feet.   Residents evacuated two wounded civilians _ one a middle-agedwoman with her jaw blown off _ on improvised stretchers.   In Zacamil, only a few civilian familiesremained in theapartment blocks.   Adriana Garcia huddled in apartment 43 of Block 111A with herfamily and Maria Zubarria, 45, who has cancer and is two days pastdue for her cobalt treatment. Mrs. Zubarria's face, forearms andankles were swollen because of the delay.   ``Please help get us out!'' Mrs. Garcia implored. She said shefelt herself a virtual hostage of the guerrillas.   ``We serve as their protection,'' she said, echoing thegovernment's contention that the rebels were shielding themselvesbehind civilians.   Rebel commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, speaking on theinsurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the guerrillas haddeclared more than a quarter of the Massachusetts-sized country``liberated.''   She said local revolutionary committees had been set up indozens of towns.   In the provinces, conflicting claims by government andguerrillas were impossible to confirm, but radio correspondents _prohibited from broadcasting news by the state of siege _ saidfighting continued in and around the provincial capitals of SanMiguel, Santa Ana and Zacatecoluca.   A 10-year-old civil war between the FMLN and a succession ofU.S.-backed governments has killed about 70,000 people, most ofthem civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
