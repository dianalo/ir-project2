Boulware died Wednesday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla., theGeneral Electric Co. reported.   Boulware took charge of employee relations for G.E. in 1947, ayear after the company had gone through a devastating strike.   He quickly developed what became known as Boulwarism, a practicehe said was designed to improve labor-management relations byshowing employees that the company wanted to do what was rightvoluntarily.   Under Boulwarism, G.E. would listen to union demands, comparewages and benefits at other companies and make an offer from whichit would not budge during further negotiations.   The policy flowered in the 1950s and '60s, but fell out of favorafter G.E. was hit with a nationwide strike in 1969 and severalcourt rulings that went against Boulwarism.   Boulware, who retired from G.E. in 1961, graduated from theUniversity of Wisconsin in 1916, and later served as an infantrycaptain in World War I.   He also taught accounting and commercial law at the Universityof Wisconsin, Florida Atlantic University and the PlymouthInstitute night school in New York.   He also wrote the books ``The Truth About Boulwarism'' and``What You Can Do About Inflation, Unemployment, Productivity,Profit and Collective Bargaining.''
