 But microcomputers have beenhelping them to get goods to market quicker than theircompetitors.andP;  US firms gain a competitive edge by usingmicrocomputers to cut production time and to link production moreclosely to sales patterns and changing trends.andP;  Quick responsetime comes about by computers linked to different automation andcommunication systems from the retail store to the factory.andO;Fabric and textile mills are using microcomputers to design fabricand increase factory efficiency.andP;  Apparel makers use them todesign clothes.andP;  Microcomputers are keeping firms competitive,despite the fact that labor and productions costs are high.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Textile industryAsiaMicrocomputersProduction ControlLabor CostsLocal Area NetworksAutomationCompetition.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Clothes WarsandM;During the past decade, the U.S.andP;  textile and apparel industry has taken amighty kick in the pants from overseas competitors.andP;  Fabric andfinished-garment imports have doubled since 1980, accounting for one-fifth ofthe nation's growing trade deficit.andP;  Almost half of the U.S.andP;  apparel marketnow belongs to foreign manufacturers.andP;  Employment in the industry has droppeddramatically, along with profits and wages, and factory closings have becomecommonplace.andM;U.S.andP;  textile and apparel makers can't manufacture goods as cheaply as theircompetitors in Asia and Latin America, where workers earn as little as 20cents an hour.andP;  But PCs and other advanced technologies help them gethot-selling items to market faster than overseas suppliers.andP;  By cuttingproduction time and linking production more closely to sales patterns, U.S.andO;firms gain an edge over importers because they can supply retailers withsmall, fast-moving inventories better tailored to the changing winds offashion.andM;The buzzword for reduced production time is guick response.andP;  It isimplemented by PCs linked to a variety of automation and communicationsystems extending from the factory floor to the retailer's shelf.andP;  Textileand fabric mills, for example, are turning to PCs to speed fabric design andincrease factory efficiency.andP;  Apparel makers use them to design clothes andto quickly produce and deliver the best-selling garments.andM;Blue-Collar PCsandM;PCs have been a driving force in raising the efficiency of U.S.andP;  textilefactories, says Mac Isaacs, executive editor of Textile World magazine.andO;Isaacs explains that many fabric mills use PCs to monitor the efficiency ofthe more than 500 looms found on a typical factory floor.andP;  &quot;No loom operatesat 100 percent efficiency,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Yarn has to be replenished, sometimesit breaks during production, and the fabric pattern has to be changed.&quot;andM;Calculating each loom's efficiency is key to planning because it allowsmanagers to assign projects strategically to groups of looms, reducingdowntime.andP;  &quot;With computers,&quot; says Isaacs, &quot;we get instantaneous analysis ofefficiency--not only by loom per shift, but by project, by location in theroom, by weave style, and so on.&quot;andM;Burlington Industries, a major producer of denim, also uses PCs for fabricdesign.andP;  Traditionally, fabric stylists sketch their designs by hand, usinggrids to represent each stitch.andP;  They select from thousands of shades andvarieties of thread and hand-color their drawings to match the thread's hueand texture as precisely as possible.andP;  The factories then configure theirlooms to generate fabric samples for buyers to inspect.andM;Producing samples can take months, especially since sketches merelyapproximate what the loom will produce.andP;  To speed the process, Burlingtonstylists at six locations now routinely design fabrics on IBM PC ATs usingthe company's proprietary CAD software, Burlstyle.andP;  Each PC is outfitted withVectrix VX-PC graphics processors and Electrohome monitors that provide morethan 10 million color gradations.andP;  The systems use Quadram's Quadjet colorprinters and Microsoft mice.andM;IMPACTandM;&quot;Because our program lets you bring up an old design, as a word processorbrings up an old document, you can simply modify that design to create a newfabric,&quot; says Rodney Sink, Burlington's internal consultant for corporateinformation systems.andP;  &quot;This speeds up the design process incredibly.&quot;andO;Burlstyle also lets designers configure the loom onscreen to simulate theappearance of the finished fabric.andP;  &quot;This simulation lets us compare colorsside by side,&quot; says Sink, &quot;allowing us to see how they will interact in thefinal product.&quot;andM;The PC BluesandM;Burlstyle was written in 1983, before commercial CAD software for textileswas available.andP;  Today several vendors market programs for both fabric andgarment design.andP;  Blue-jeans giant Levi Strauss uses Computer Design's Concept2D system, which it runs on IRIS 3030 workstations from Silicon Graphics.andO;Levi Strauss plans to expand the system, which works on a variety of hardwareplatforms, to PCs as well.andM;&quot;We used to just sketch garments by hand,&quot; says Jackie Care, a designer atLevi Strauss.andP;  &quot;But the computer lets us try different variations moreceasily--especially colors.&quot;andP;  Using a Howtek Scanmaster, for example,designers can scan a trouser fabric into the system.andP;  They can them fit thefabric into an onscreen silhouette of a pair of pants that is eitherhand-drawn or pulled from a library of existing designs.andP;  Designers caninterchange garment styles, fabrics, and colors at will, printing out theresults on a Mitsubishi Shinko thermal printer.andM;Although the system saves time, Care says it's still too early to throw awayher paints and pencils.andP;  &quot;Line drawings aren't as clear on the monitor asthey should be,&quot; she says.andP;  &quot;We still get a more accurate effect when we drawsomething by hand if it has a lot of detail on it.andP;  You're limited by thenumber of pixels you have on the screen.&quot;andM;Jean GenieandM;Making the fabric and the clothes is only part of the business.andP;  Companiesmust keep in touch with the market and service their retail outlets.andP;  To dothat more effectively, Levi Strauss is expanding its use of electronic datainterchange (EDI), a computer-based inventory and financial communicationsystem.andP;  The company offers retailers and suppliers a set of EDI-basedelectronic services called LeviLink.andM;These services, when used in conjunction with retailers' own inventorymanagement systems, automate the ordering, receiving, stocking, invoicing,and sales analysis of Levi Strauss products.andP;  &quot;We're trying to foster asystem that our customer's computer can act upon without human intervention,&quot;says Ralph Briskin, a manager of LeviLink services.andM;Besides saving time by processing orders electronically, merchants receivetheir merchandise pretagged from the Levi Strauss factory.andP;  Store clerkssimply scan in information from the box and packing slips to automaticallyenter six pairs of stone-washed 501 jeans, size 32/33, for example, into thestore's own PC-based inventory management system.andP;  The jeans can then go tostore shelves immediately, saving up to two weeks of processing time.andO;Bar-code scanners at cash registers delete each pair of jeans from inventoryas it is sold, helping stores keep track of customer preferences.andM;Levi Strauss makes the service available via the General Electric InformationServices Company (GEISCO) network or on any third-party data communicationsservice, Briskin says.andM;EDI systems have become almost a staple of the trade.andP;  Retailers have learnedthat the greater control and cost savings afforded by the systems help makeup for U.S.andP;  manufacturers' higher base prices.andM;Susan Griffin, associate director of the Apparel Manufacturing TechnologyCenter in Atlanta, explains that when a retailer orders 1,000 coats fromKorea, he can expect to wait as long as nine months for delivery.andP;  Thatforces stores to commit to placing larger orders so they can be sure to coverdemand.andP;  &quot;But remember last year's miniskirts?andP;  No one wanted to buy them.andO;Retailers got stuck with merchandise they couldn't sell.andP;  And they won'tforget that,&quot; says Griffin.andM;With the help of PC technology, U.S.andP;  companies provide faster delivery andsmaller, less risky orders.andP;  That kind of service is needed to help keep U.S.andO;firms competitive even in the face of higher labor and production costs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
