(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen television evangelist JimBakker, just finished with a whirlwind visit to his old PTLministry stomping grounds, may want to buy back the Smoky Mountainretreat he left last year, his attorney said Thursday.   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, spent two days visiting thetelevision ministry they left a year ago amid a sex scandal, thendrove Wednesday to a house they used here.   ``Probably the first thing they did was dust off the books.They've been gone nine months,'' said Ryan Hovis, an attorney withoffices in Rock Hill and Columbia, S.C.   He said he did not know how long the Bakkers would stay or whatexactly they would do. ``There are some meetings we've got to havesometime soon in Charlotte (N.C.), so they'll be there for that,''Hovis said.   Bakker got a warm reception from some longtime supportersTuesday and Wednesday when he visited the Heritage USA theme parkat PTL's headquarters in Fort Mill, S.C., about 150 miles east ofhere.   Bakker, who wants to begin a new television ministry, said he'slooking for a secluded house in the region, wants to open an officenear Heritage USA and may ask for air time on the PTL Network.   Bakker has several times in the past said that he and his wifeshould have a chance to salvage the ministry, but PTL officialshave always ruled it out.   The ministry is up to $130 million in debt, and a reorganizationplan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approvalin Bankruptcy Court.   On Tuesday, Bakker told reporters he might try to buy PTL'sassets when they are liquidated, but refused to say where he wouldget the money.   Hovis said the Gatlinburg house, which has a 12-foot stone andwrought-iron security wall and a swimming pool, still belongs toPTL creditor Roe Messner, a Wichita, Kan., contractor.   The Bakkers bought the house in 1987 and later deeded it toMessner, ``But I think eventually they'll want to buy it back,''the attorney said.   Meanwhile, a recently formed investment group that is seekingPTL's assets said it has abandoned efforts to secure a $25 millionletter of credit.   Family Entertainment America Inc., a partnership of real-estatedevelopers, mortgage bankers, political strategists and a formerPTL broadcasting executive, is instead seeking partners to raisecash, said company spokesman Kerry Moody, in Laguna Beach, Calif.   Bakker left PTL after charges that Jessica Hahn, a churchsecretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter. Hisdeparture was followed by revelations about a lavish lifestyle, andhe was defrocked by the Assemblies of God.</TEXT></DOC>
