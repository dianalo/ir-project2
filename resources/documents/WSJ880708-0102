Boeing, an aerospace concern, said the planes are scheduled to be delivered between September and December 1989. Including the latest order, Qantas will own 43 Boeing aircraft. The 747-400s will use Rolls-Royce PLC engines, and the 767-300 will use General Electric Co. engines. The new aircraft will be financed by Qantas's foreign-exchange earnings and by overseas borrowings.    Qantas said the new aircraft would be used to meet demand caused by increased tourism into Australia. </TEXT></DOC>
