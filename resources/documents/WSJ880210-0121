Boland </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> NCR </CO><TEXT>   Shareholders of NCR Corp. may be surprised to learn their diminished status as mere &quot;stakeholders.&quot; In a series of ads that began late last year, the company has been promoting its image as a good citizen by offering a notion with a somewhat spotty history: that the great wide world in which a company operates deserves as much consideration as the corporate owners.    As NCR tells it, stakeholders include customers, employees, suppliers, the &quot;world-wide communities in which we operate&quot; and, closing the list, &quot;our shareholders.&quot; Even then, shareholders' interests are coupled with those of &quot;financial communities&quot; -- which, a helpful PR spokesman elaborates, could mean &quot;a financial analyst or a bank we might borrow money from.&quot;    This goes beyond corporate happy-face advertising, which typically implies that billions of dollars of capital are deployed in fiber-optic communications so Grandma can hear Little Earl's first burp by long distance. And it entails more than the reasonable notion that being a good citizen -- however one defines that -- is good for business. Says NCR's public relations man: &quot;We don't think there is any fundamental conflict among stakeholders.&quot;    This view isn't NCR's alone. A whole corporate culture has sprung up arguing for the the essential commonality of labor-management-community-shareholder interests. But where managers and directors are concerned, it poses a problem: There clearly are conflicts of interest among groups (an expansion that seems a good risk to an equityholder may be too gamy for a bondholder), and the only direct, clear legal obligation of corporate fiduciaries (beyond obeying civil law and contractual constraints in general) is to corporate owners who pay them.    How do corporate owners fare as stakeholders? To start with, only a certain class of owners is deemed legitimate: those with a long-term view that happens to coincide with management's. An owner with a short investment objective is probably pursuing his own crude, profit-motivated interest at the expense of other stakeholders. This is not an exercise of good citizenship by the shareholder.    At NCR, any aberrant urges among stock-owning stakeholders are muffled by a rights plan, a staggered board and a supermajority provision. These permit management to plan for the long-term welfare of everybody without fear that one money-hungry class will forget its obligations to the group. (In NCR's ads, management is not listed among stakeholders, but Charles E. Exley Jr., the chief executive, earned $938,000 in 1986.)    USX Corp.'s chairman, David Roderick, has been an eloquent champion of the national stakeholders' interest. Testifying in support of Sen. William Proxmire's anti-takeover bill, Mr. Roderick complained of &quot;massive abuses by a small group of raiders, arbitragers, promoters and investment bankers, who reap enormous profits serving only their own self-interest at the expense of stockholders, employees, creditors, communities and the nation at large.&quot; (Mr. Roderick, serving the national interest, collected $735,000 in 1986.)    Managements know how far they can go. They wouldn't deny labor's agents the right to seek high wages, though bemoaning the folly (and embracing a national incomes policy if they get the chance). But they have, with some success, imposed on directors higher duties than representing the corporate owners. It's worth noting that no other stakeholders have been similarly disenfranchised: customers, suppliers, communities and lenders all have agents serving solely their interests in transactions with the company. All have full freedom to alter or end the transactions if they find their specific interests are not well served by corporate management. A corporate owner, who wishes to retain his ownership, is increasingly at the mercy of his hirelings.    While the notion of stakeholders traces back to managerial theories of the 1960s, according to NCR, there's a nice irony in the fact that it was pushed hardest in recent years by the anti-business left. &quot;What is needed,&quot; an old activist, Tom Hayden, wrote in 1980 (&quot;The American Future&quot;), &quot;is for the concept of shareholder to be broadened to that of 'stakeholder.' All those affected by corporate behavior -- the general public, workers, consumers, and the surrounding community -- ought to have some representation on corporate boards.&quot; NCR hasn't gone that far.    The left saw stakeholders as a way of stripping ownership from property and gaining control. That's an idea some corporate managers could learn to love.    ---   Mr. Boland writes on investing from Baltimore. </TEXT></DOC>
