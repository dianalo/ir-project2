As a general rule, exports of animals and plantslisted on Appendix II of the Convention may occur only if a ScientificAuthority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exportswill not be detrimental to the survival of the species, and if the ManagementAuthority is satisfied that the animals or plants were not obtained inviolation of laws enacted for their protection. Based on documentationpresented for consideration by the Convention Parties in 1983, the UnitedStates Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the Americanalligator is listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearanceunder Article II.2(b) of the Convention as well as the potential threatto the species survival under Convention Article II.2(a).On February 28, 1989, the Service published a notice (54 FR 8365) proposingto grant export approval for legally taken American alligators, alligatormeat, parts, and products from previously approved States, plus the additionof Alabama and Mississippi, for the 1989-1991 harvest seasons.This document announces the final findings and rule by the U. S. ScientificAuthority and Management Authority that approves the export of alligatorsharvested during the 1989-1991 taking seasons from certain States previouslyapproved for such export for the 1986-1988 harvest seasons plus the additionof Alabama and Mississippi. This rule also stipulates that management procedurespreviously established for this species be continued.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATED: </T2>August 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Please send correspondence concerning this rule tothe Office of Scientific Authority; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Mailstop725-Arlington Square, 18th and C Streets NW, Washington, DC 20240.

The reason for this approachis that it is more effective to issue general decisions on the export ofall specimens harvested in a given State and season than to issue suchdecisions separately for each permit application. This is true especiallyfor Convention Appendix II species that are frequently exported, such asthe American alligator. On September 2, 1986, (51 FR 31130) and August15, 1988, (53 FR 30682) the Service published rules granting export approvalfor American alligators (<T3>Alligator mississippiensis</T3>) from specified States for the 1986-1988harvest seasons. On February 28, 1989, the Service published a notice (54 FR 8365) proposingto continue such export approval for the 1989-1991 harvest seasons fromthese same States plus the addition of Alabama and Mississippi. The purposeof this announcement and rule is to allow the export of legally taken Americanalligators (hides, meat, parts, and products) for the 1989-1991 harvestyears from previously approved States plus the addition of Alabama andMississippi.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scientific Authority Findings</ITAG>Article IV of CITES requires that an export permit for any specimen ofa species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findingshave been made by the Scientific Authority and Management Authority ofthe exporting country. The Scientific Authority must advise ``that suchexport will not be detrimental to the survival of that species'' beforean export permit can be granted by the Management Authority.The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problemsof potential threat to the survival of American alligators (ConventionArticle II.2(a)) and its similarity in appearance to other crocodiliansthat are threatened with possible extinction (Convention Article II.2(b)).The marking of all hides harvested with specified tags and the markingand documentation of shipments of meat and parts, required prior to theissuance of export permits by the Service, is considered sufficient toaddress the issue of identification due to the similarity in appearancebetween American alligators and other listed species (see Management Authorityfindings for export program and tag specifications).Inasmuch as the alligator is also listed because of a potential threatto its survival, the Service must determine if exports will not be detrimentalto the survival of the American alligator itself.Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of Americanalligators under the provisions of Convention Article II.2(a), are summarizedas follows:A. Minimum requirements for biological information: (1) Information on the condition of the population, including trends (themethod of determination to be a matter of State choice), and populationestimates where such information is available;(2) Information on total harvest of the species;(3) Information on distribution of harvest; and (4) Habitat evaluation.B. Minimum requirements for a management program:(1) There should be a controlled harvest, methods and seasons to be a matterof choice by the State of origin;(2) All hides, meat, and parts should be registered and marked; and, (3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the Stateof origin.The Service's Office of Scientific Authority finds that current informationon population status, management, and harvest reviewed concerning all theStates in question, fully support a finding that the export of alligatorstaken in accordance with Service-approved State regulations during the1989-1991 harvest seasons will not be detrimental to the survival of thespecies in the States receiving export approval. Tagging of hides and thesealing and marking of meat and parts by Service-approved States of origin,and documentation of shipments by the U.S. Management Authority provideassurance that export will not reduce the effectiveness of the Conventionin controlling trade in other species of crocodilians. Documents containinginformation that provided the basis for the Service's findings are availablefor public inspection at the Office of Scientific Authority (address givenabove). <ITAG tagnum="84">Management Authority Findings </ITAG>Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under the Convention onlyif the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens were not obtainedin contravention of laws enacted for the protection of the involved species.The Service, therefore, must be satisfied that alligator hides, meat, parts,or products were not obtained in violation of State or Federal law in orderto allow export. Evidence of legal taking for American alligator is providedby Service-approved State hide tagging and container sealing and markingprograms. The Service annually contracts for the manufacture and deliveryof special Convention animal hide tags for export-approved States to applyto legally taken animal skins. In a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 FR 15548),the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of a US-CITEStag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-supplied export tag toprovide further evidence of legal export for certain Convention AppendixII listed species. Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State Americanalligator export programs, slightly modified from the 1986-1988 rule, underprovisions of Convention Article IV.2 (b), are summarized as follows: (1) Current State alligator trapping and tagging, meat and parts processing,and shipping regulations must be on file with the Office of ManagementAuthority (OMA); (2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat and parts packing seal, partstag, and description of standard meat/parts container must be on file withOMA; (3) The export tag must be durable, permanently locking, and must showU.S.-CITES logo, State of origin, season of take, species, and be seriallyunique; (4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag must be applied by the Stateto all hides, meat, or parts, within a minimum time after take or processing,as specified by State law, and such time should be as short as possibleto minimize movement of untagged hides, meat, or parts; (5) The tags or seals must be permanently attached to the hide or container,as mandated by Service-approved State programs; (6) All alligator harvesters and processors must be registered by the Stateof origin; (7) All hide, meat, and parts dealers must be registered by the State oforigin; (8) All State-registered alligator harvesters, processors, and dealersmust make available their alligator harvest and commerce data to the Stateon at least an annual basis, as specified by the State; (9) State-registered alligator dealers and licensed harvesters authorizedby the State to attach export tags to the hides, in a program approvedby the Service, must account for all tags received and must return unusedtags to the State within a specified time after the harvest period closes;(10) Fully manufactured alligator hide products may be exported from theUnited States when the State-applied Convention export tags, removed fromhides contained in the manufactured products, are surrendered to the Serviceprior to export; and (11) Alligator meat and parts may be exported from the United States inState-standard containers that are sealed and marked in accordance withthe State's export program, as approved by the Service. The Service's Office of Management Authority has reviewed the alligatorexport tagging programs of certain previously approved States and the newStates (Alabama and Mississippi), and has found that these programs fullymeet the guidelines listed above. Documents containing information thatprovided the basis for the Service's findings are available for publicinspection at the Office of Management Authority (address given above).The Service hereby approves exports of 1989-1991 harvested alligators,hide, meat, and parts in the States receiving export approval on the groundsthat both Scientific Authority and Management Authority export requirementsare satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Multi-year Findings</ITAG>The Service has monitored existing State programs for the American alligatorin most of the previously approved States for many years and expects thatthese States will continue to satisfy Convention requirements. To ensurethat Service-approved States maintain successful export programs and thatexport is not detrimental to the survival of the species, the Service plansto continue annual monitoring of State management and export marking programsthrough evaluation of State program information and export reports fromU.S. ports. Annual State program reports must be available to the Officeof the Management Authority (address given above) no later than May 31of each year.States seeking for the first time to establish a regular harvest programfor alligators should begin working with the Service early enough in orderto develop their alligator programs and then apply for Convention exportapproval no later than January 2 of the year they plan to initiate sucha program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>No comment was received from any source concerning this rule.This rule is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).

It isthe Service's opinion that a delay in the effective date of the regulationsafter this final rulemaking is published could adversely impact the speciesby preventing the international marketing of the hides and meat (wherecommercial harvest is an important part of the State conservation programs)thereby reducing the incentive for takers or dealers to comply with Staterequirements in the approved States. The Service, therefore, finds that``good cause'' exists, within the terms of U.S.C.(d)(3) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, for these regulations to take effect immediately under 5U.S.C.(d)(1).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>No comment was received from any source concerning this rule.This rule is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The primary author is Mr. S. RonaldSinger, Office of Management of Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The Department had previously determined that the exportof alligators of various States taken in the 1986-1988 harvest seasonswas not a major Federal action that would significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of theNational Environmental Policy Act, therefore, the preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement was not required (49 FR 1058). Because these proposedfindings do not significantly differ from the prior export findings, theprevious determination not to prepare an Environmental Impact Statementon export of alligators taken during the 1986-1988 harvest seasons in certainStates (51 FR 31130) remains appropriate. The Department had also previouslydetermined that such harvest was not a major rule under Executive Order12291 and did not have a significant economic affect on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).Because the existing rule treats exports on a State-by-State basis andproposes to approve export in accordance with a State management/exportprogram, the rule will have little effect on small entities in and of itself.This rule does not contain any information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23</ITAG>Wildlife, Imports, Exports, Plants (agriculture), Endangered and threatenedwildlife, Endangered and threatened plants, Animals, Fish, Transportation,Marine mammals, Forests and forest products, Foreign officials, Treaties,and Foreign trade.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION</ITAG>Accordingly, the Service proposes to amend part 23 of title 50, Code ofFederal Regulations, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 50_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
