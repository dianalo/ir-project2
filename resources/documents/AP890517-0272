FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, testifying before a HouseBanking subcommittee, split from other bank regulators who saidcurrent law provides them with enough authority.   The practice of raising deposits through brokers has beencriticized for making the savings and loan crisis worse. The funds,raised through brokers who earn fees by channeling clients' moneyto institutions paying the highest interest rates, has allowed someshaky institutions to grow far more rapidly than they could havethrough local deposits.   Healthy banks and Sandamp;Ls object to the practice because they oftenhave to raise their rates to compete.   But all the regulators, including Seidman, said brokereddeposits, used properly, can be beneficial, allowing institutionsto raise money to make a big loan or meet a temporary cash crunch.Sometimes they are the only way for troubled institutions to stayafloat while they wait the government to shut them down.   Forbidding brokered deposits ``is a little bit like saying weshould abolish the manufacturing of automobiles because some peopledrive too fast,'' said Comptroller of the Currency Robert L.Clarke, who regulates nationally chartered banks.   Clark, Federal Reserve Board member H. Robert Heller and FederalHome Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who oversees savingsand loans, told the Subcommittee on General Oversight andInvestigations that brokered deposits are currently under control.They recommended further study before enacting legislation on thesubject.   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, sponsored a provision onbrokered deposits in Sandamp;L bailout legislation, which passed theSenate last month. It would bar weak institutions from usingdeposits brokers unless the institutions get a waiver from the FDIC.   That is the reverse of the current practice under which brokereddeposits are assumed to be permissible unless regulators sayotherwise.   Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., sponsored a similar section in a billpassed earlier this month by the House Banking Committee.   Rep. Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky., chairman of the subcommittee, saidhe held Wednesday's hearing to serve as a basis for debate when theSandamp;L legislation reaches the House floor.   But he said he has not yet decided whether to attempt to deletethe brokered deposit clause.   Seidman, who under President Bush's proposal to close or mergefailed Sandamp;Ls, would get broad new power to oversee savings and loansin addition to commercial banks, said he would not object gettingspecific authority to act against brokered deposits.   Regulators currently must prove the deposits are being usedunsafely before they can act.   But Seidman said he would prefer his agency to be permitted tocurb brokered deposits at healthy institutions, which at times usethem unwisely, and that it be able to set general rules on brokereddeposits rather than be forced to grant waivers to individualinstitutions.   Murkowski, testifying before Hubbard's panel, said securitiesbrokers, who earn fees for placing deposits, are lobbying againsthis proposal.   The deposits have soared in popularity, particularly afterinvestors fled the market following the 1987 stock crash.   He said brokered deposits now account for 7.4 percent of Sandamp;Ldeposits, up from 2.6 percent for Sandamp;Ls in June 1983. They accountfor 5.3 percent of commercial bank deposits, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
