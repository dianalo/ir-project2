But after a decade of planning and tending these globallines, big companies and institutions are increasinglyturning the job over to global communications carriers.</LP><TEXT>   That could be a bonanza for big carriers out to fillunderused high-capacity networks and offset lower profitsfrom their mature commodity-transmission business. Such&quot;network outsourcing&quot; is a $2.3 billion-a-year industrythat's growing more than 20% a year in the U.S. alone, saysHoward Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, aBoston research firm.   Outsourcing can help a business customer cut its overheadand avoid aggravation, say many users. It's hard enough, theyadd, for a big multinational to keep its globalcommunications open without also mastering new technologiessuch as &quot;frame-relay&quot; and &quot;SMDS&quot; (Switched Multimegabit DataService) transmission.   The new movement recalls the late 1980s when Eastman KodakCo. and other companies began turning over theirdata-processing centers to outsiders. To trim overhead, forexample, the photographic-products giant called inInternational Business Machines Corp. and Digital EquipmentCorp. to run its centers. Kodak was able to cut 1,000 jobsand associated costs in the process. And IBM and DigitalEquipment won a blue-chip client they could tout in seekingother outsourcing businesses whose growth rates far exceedthose for their computer hardware.   Now telecom carriers stand to make similar gains. AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and British TelecommunicationsPLC's North American unit each recently took over two of J.P.Morgan andamp; Co.'s three world-wide networks. Sprint Corp. ishelping Anglo-Dutch consumer-products giant Unilever Groupsell more soap. MCI Communications Corp. runs computer makerSun Microsystems Inc.'s Pacific Rim network operations. AtChevron Corp., ATandamp;T and Chevron technicians now work togetherto run the U.S. portion of Chevron's international network.And General Electric Co.'s GE Information Services is doingGod's work -- sort of. GE is running the Vatican's globaldata network, linking the Holy See with dioceses and otherchurch installations around the world.   Fueling this expansion is the growing complexity ofcomputer networking and the increasingly international natureof companies and institutions. &quot;We have 500 companiesoperating in 75 countries,&quot; says Nick White, director ofworld-wide telecommunications services at Unilever. &quot;In fact,we're buying and selling a company a week.&quot; This, he says,keeps Unilever's network in a constant state of flux.   Meanwhile, data traffic among corporate users is booming.Phone gab at corporations is growing by an average of 4% ayear in traffic minutes, while mainframe computer networkingusage is climbing by 11%. Personal-computer networks and thesystems that connect them are handling traffic that isgrowing 35% a year. Most companies must hire one networkingexpert for every 25 employees who use a PC on a network, saysYankee Group. &quot;All of this is . . . making companies look atwhat they're spending and whether it's producing goodresults,&quot; says Ronald Bamberg, vice president of productmarketing and management at BT North America.   Improving Unilever's data-networking efficiency couldenhance product development and marketing by its companies,says Mr. White. &quot;When we're launching a new shampoo or icecream, we might testmarket these in more than one country andshare market-research data and the financial performance ofthe product among several offices,&quot; he says. &quot;We also want tostandardize the products we sell such as Elizabeth Arden'sRed Door perfume . . . One type of product {may currently} besold in 100 different bottle sizes around the world.&quot;   Not all customers are rushing to embrace outsourcing,however. Kmart Corp., for example, which runs a huge privatedata network connecting its branches via satellite andsmall-dish rooftop antennas, tapped Sprint to set up many ofits transmission lines. But &quot;at no point did we yield controlof our network to them,&quot; says David Carlson, Kmart's seniorvice president of information systems.   The failure of some past outsourcing projects may haveunnerved some potential customers. A few years ago, MerrillLynch andamp; Co. tapped MCI and IBM to handle all of itsnetworking. But Merrill determined that the vendors couldn'tmeet some of its data-transmission requirements and canceledthe agreement. While MCI went on to capture a sizable chunkof Merrill's phone business, the cancellation of thedata-outsourcing agreement &quot;scared other customers away fromsuch arrangements,&quot; says Berge Ayvazian, an analyst who workswith Mr. Anderson.   Network outsourcing comes in many flavors. It can beroutine assistance such as asking a carrier to set up andmonitor transmission lines for a fee. The most elaborateoutsourcing involves an outright takeover by a carrier of acustomer's network facilities, such as when J.P. Morganrecently hired BT North America and ATandamp;T to take over two ofits three international data networks. The giant New Yorkinvestment bank says BT's $20 million contract alone willsave it $12 million in operating costs over the next fiveyears.   Peter Miller, vice president of global communications atMorgan, says the carriers are better equipped to handle theinternational expansion of the networks and the headachesthat go along with running them. ATandamp;T's and BT's people willrun the Morgan networks. And Morgan can reassign its workersto tasks more germane to its business -- like banking.   ATandamp;T yesterday announced a plan to run and manage datanetworks overseas. &quot;We are deploying switches andtransmission systems that we will own and maintain,&quot; saidStan Kabala, vice president of ATandamp;T's Business SpecialServices. Morgan will use ATandamp;T's facilities to tie itsindividual office-computer networks in 13 countries &quot;into onelarge local-area network,&quot; says Mr. Miller. For another datanetwork, Morgan will use BT's global system of 5,000communications hubs.   Ever cautious about network failures, Morgan had eachcarrier guarantee that it would maintain a certain level ofservice or forfeit a chunk of Morgan's monthly tab. BT NorthAmerica's Mr. Bamberg says there is a &quot;premium charge&quot; forthis but won't say how much.   The services seem like a good deal for companies lookingto get out of the communications business and husband theirresources, says Mark Winther, an analyst at Link ResourcesInc., a New York research firm. But he says clients shouldproceed with care. &quot;Remember company private data networksproliferated over the last 10 years because the service fromcarriers was lousy,&quot; Mr. Winther notes. &quot;The issue for a lotof these customers should be: Can the vendors do it betterand do it cheaper? That's not clear right now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
