The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that threeCalifornia metropolitan areas _ Anaheim-Santa Ana, Los Angeles andSan Francisco _ continue to lead the nation in appreciation ofexisting single-family homes.   A 32.1 percent rise in median prices in the July-Septemberquarter over that period a year ago kept the Anaheim-Santa Ana areathe costliest housing market in the nation, with a median price of$226,200.   Los Angeles, where prices rose 23.7 percent to $190,900, had thesecond highest appreciation rate, followed by San Francisco, whichhad a 21.5 percent increase to a median of $213,700, meaning halfsold for more and half for less.   In Honolulu, where the median price of $226,000 was thesecond-highest in the nation, home prices climbed 18.6 percent, thefourth best appreciation rate.   Nationally, the third-quarter median resale price forsingle-family homes was $90,200, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier.   ``The West Coast is amazing. Who knows how long they'll be ableto keep it up,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S.League of Savings Institutions.   He attributed high prices in San Francisco to scarcity ofsuitable land for building and in Honolulu to buying by Japaneseinvestors.   But, sooner or later, high prices likely will cut into buying andcause price increases to moderate, as they have in the Northeast, hesaid.   The most expensive areas to buy a home, following Anaheim-SantaAna and Honolulu, were, in order, San Francisco, New York, LosAngeles, Boston, Hartford, San Diego, Washington, D.C., andProvidence, R.I.   But, appreciation rates in New York, Boston and Hartford, Conn.,were below the national average. The median price in Philadelphiaactually fell by 3.5 percent.   Home prices in the New York metropolitan area, including LongIsland and northern New Jersey, rose to $192,600 in the thirdquarter, up 1.2 percent from the same period a year earlier. Priceswere up 1.0 percent in Boston to a median of $184,100.   ``The Northeast has finally cooled off after leading the nationin both sales and price increases over the last three years,'' saidJohn A. Tuccillo, chief economist of the Realtors organization.   Among cities in the industrial heartland, prices rose 17.7percent in Buffalo, N.Y., the fifth best climb in the nation; 14.0percent in Detroit and 10.5 percent in Chicago. Appreciation ratesalso were above average in Grand Rapids, Mich.; Akron, Toledo andCincinnati, Ohio; Indianapolis; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, andMinneapolis.   ``Rising exports (causing a resurgence at U.S. manufacturingplants) have led to a surprisingly robust housing market in theMidwest,'' Tuccillo said.   Earlier in the 1980s, the Midwest lagged other regions in priceincreases and the least-costly cities are still in that region. DesMoines, Iowa, with a median price of $55,000, was the cheapest,followed by Louisville, Ky.; Lansing, Mich.; Oklahoma City; andGrand Rapids, Mich.   Fifteen metropolitan areas showed price declines from a yearearlier, led by Denver, with a 10.9 percent drop. Baton Rouge, La.;Oklahoma City; and San Antonio and Dallas, Texas, all suffereddeclines greater than 5 percent.   ``The collapse of the oil-based economy and the overbuilding thathad taken place continue to produce downward pressure on home pricesin these areas,'' Obrinsky said.   ``But at least in the case of Texas, we've seen some increase inpopulation, along with economic growth, so it looks like we'recoming to the end of this process.''   Home prices in Houston and San Antonio have risen over the pastsix months, but are still below prices a year ago.   Meanwhile, the pace of sales in Texas improved 10.2 percentbetween the second and third quarters after holding steady for twoquarters.   Nationally, the Realtors group said the resale pace ofcondominiums and single-family homes declined a slight 0.7 percentto a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 4 million units, down from4.03 million units in the second quarter.   Tuccillo attributed the sales decline to a slight increase inmortgage rates. According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,interest charged for fixed-rate mortgages, excluding add-on feesknown as points, averaged 10.5 percent in the third quarter, up from10.39 percent in the second quarter.   Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia postedquarter-to-quarter increases in the July-September sales pace,compared with 32 states showing increases in the second quarter.Twenty-three states posted sales declines, while two were unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
