Washington-based Telecommunications Research and Action Centerand San Francisco-based Consumer Action said their survey showsthese providers' rates are as much as 3{ times higher than those ofthe major long-distance companies.   The companies, called alternative operator services or AOScompanies, provide service to guests in hotels and motels and atpay phones, as well as at some hospitals and universities, whichreceive commissions from the AOS.   The companies handle credit card, collect and third-party billedcalls, routing ``0''-plus calls over lines leased from the majorlong-distance carriers.   David Wagenhauser, staff attorney for the center, said consumersneed to be protected from the high rates of these companies.   ``Just because these are transient consumers doesn't mean theyshould be moving targets,'' he said at a news conference outsidethe FCC headquarters.   The FCC, prompted by a surge in complaints about AOS companieslast spring, launched an investigation into the industry, whichbegan developing about a year and a half ago. The agency alsoissued a consumer alert advising callers to ask operators whatrates they will be charged.   The FCC does not regulate the rates AOS companies charge forinterstate long-distance calls. Several states, however, have begunconsidering regulation of the industry for intrastate calls.   The consumer groups criticized the FCC for failing to takeaction against AOS providers.   Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone enforcement unit,defended the agency against the criticism, noting its inquiry intothe industry and its work on behalf of irate consumers seekingcredit for AOS calls.   The FCC also has been meeting with AOS companies, Vogt said.``I've been pleased with the response with the industry, admittingthere are problems and working out solutions.''   The consumer groups said the FCC should revoke the operatingauthority of Central Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; InternationalTelecharge Inc. of Dallas; National Telephone Services Inc. ofRockville, Md.; Payline Systems Inc. of Portland, Ore.; andTelesphere Network Inc. of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.   A. Roger Pease, president of Payline Systems, acknowledged that``there are some bad apples'' among AOS providers, but he said,``this industry has a right to compete.''   Pease said the consumer groups' petition to the FCC isunwarranted. He said the marketplace will shake out the unethicalcompanies and a newly formed trade association for operator serviceproviders will help establish a code of ethics for the industry.</TEXT></DOC>
