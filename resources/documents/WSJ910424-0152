Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady will meet withRepublican members of the House Banking Committee today totry to block a move by Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), thepanel's chairman, to rush through the House a bill to givethe bank insurance fund a $25 billion credit line with theTreasury.</LP><TEXT>   The administration so far has resisted bargaining overelements of its comprehensive plan to modernize the bankingsystem. But Treasury officials are talking about strippingout some of the more controversial proposals, such asallowing commercial companies to own banks, in order tonegotiate a bill with better chances of passage. At aminimum, the Treasury wants a $70 billion insurance fundrecapitalization plan, limits on deposit insurance, newregulations that encourage banks to increase capital, andnationwide banking. Officials also hope that a final billwill allow banks to affiliate with securities firms, but thisremains controversial.   Mr. Gonzalez promised that the committee will consider abroad package of bank reforms after recapitalizing theinsurance fund. But the administration is afraid that thecommittee will lose momentum on banking modernization.   Yesterday, the three top bank regulators -- Comptroller ofthe Currency Robert Clarke, Federal Reserve Board ChairmanAlan Greenspan and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ChairmanWilliam Seidman -- told the Senate Banking Committee thatthey strongly support the administration's proposal as a wayto modernize and strengthen the banking system.   Although Mr. Greenspan supported the Treasury's proposalto establish a $70 billion line of credit for the bankinsurance fund, which is about to start borrowing money fromthe Federal Financing Bank to pay for the failure of the Bankof New England, he objected to part of the proposal thatwould allow the fund to borrow as much as $25 billion fromthe Federal Reserve. He argued that such borrowing could seta bad precedent that could make it difficult for the Fed toachieve its monetary policy objectives.   When Mr. Brady meets with House Republicans tomorrow hewill press for the comprehensive bill, but administrationofficials say the Treasury is prepared to look for the bestbill it can get. A possible starting point is a bill alreadyintroduced by Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie, the banking panel'sranking Republican. That proposal would limit the coverage offederal deposit insurance, tighten bank regulation and allownationwide banking.   Mr. Seidman said that the balance in the bank depositinsurance fund has declined to about $7 billion and that thefund will have to borrow between $5 billion and $5.5 billionto meet working capital needs arising from the failure of theBank of New England.   Under a law passed last year, the FDIC will borrow themoney through the Federal Financing Bank, which coordinatesborrowing by government agencies.   Mr. Seidman also said that the FDIC is in the middle of adispute with the General Accounting Office, the audit arm ofCongress, over the exact size of the bank fund. The GAO,which audits the fund each year, says the fund's reserves maybe several billion dollars less than the FDIC calculates. Mr.Seidman attributed the difference to a disagreement over whento charge the fund for anticipated losses from bank failures.   If the GAO prevails with its argument that the fund issmaller than the FDIC believes, Congress is likely to feelmore pressure to move quickly on a plan to bolster the fund.</TEXT></DOC>
