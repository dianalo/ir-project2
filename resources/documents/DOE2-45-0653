The liquid fraction is subcooled,expanded in the top region of a rectification column, and mixed withthe expanded gaseous fraction. The rectification process produces a productflow containing C/sub 2+/ hydrocarbons, and a residual gas containingmostly lower-boiling constituents. The residual gas is heated up by indirectheat exchange with condensate and then by heat exchange with the gaseousfraction after partial condensation and with the natural gas led intothe partial condensation process. The heated residual gas is expanded,producing work, and heated again by heat exchange with the natural gasto be cooled.</TEXT></DOC>
