SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of American children living withstepparents has risen sharply, as women have children beforemarriage and parents change spouses, the Census Bureau reportedThursday.   The number of children under age 18 living with a stepparentjumped 11.6 percent between 1980 and 1985, increasing from 6,082,000to 6,789,000, the bureau reported.   During the same period the number of children in biologicalfamilies, that is, children living with both their natural parents,slipped from 39.5 million to 37.2 million.   The findings on stepchildren were reported Thursday in ``Studiesin Marriage and the Family,'' the first of a new series of specialtopical studies to be issued by the agency.   The report contains sections on unmarrieds, single parents andmarried couple families. It summarizes information issued previouslyby the bureau, bringing together statistics on related topics in asingle publication.   The rise in stepchildren has occurred during a period when moredivorces were occurring, giving rise to second marriages.   For there to be a stepchild in a family, at least one of theparents had to be married twice or the mother had to have a birthprior to her first marriage, the report observed.   As of 1985, the bureau found, 4,469,000 married couples includedstepchildren in their families. Of these 2,387,000 included onlystepchildren, while 2,082,000 families included both stepchildrenand biological children of that couple.   For stepchildren, the vast majority lived with their biologicalmother and a stepfather. Only 10.9 percent in 1985 were living withthe biological father and a stepmother.   Other detail reported in the new compilation included:   _The share of Americans aged 18 and over who are single increasedfrom 28 percent in 1970 to 37 percent in 1988.   _The median age at first marriage was 25.9 for men and 23.6 forwomen in 1988. By comparison it was 22.8 for men and 20.3 for womenin 1960.   _As of 1988, 10.1 percent of all adults who had ever been marriedwere divorced, up from 3.8 percent in 1970.   _The number of unmarried couples living together rose from523,000 in 1970 to 2.6 million in 1988.   _Between 1970 and 1988 the number of single parents climbed from3.8 million to 9.4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
