Hayes's posthumous &quot;The DarkRomance of Dian Fossey&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 352 pages, $21.95)come with an enthusiastic blurb from the man who createdArchie Bunker and helped destroy Robert Bork. According toNorman Lear, &quot;Harold Hayes delivers Ms. Fossey in an envelopeof compassion and understanding that derives from his own25-year love affair with Africa. To top that off, his proseis simply brilliant.&quot;   Mr. Hayes's prose is pretty good, but the remark about&quot;compassion&quot; made me wonder if Mr. Lear and I were readingthe same book. In &quot;Dark Romance,&quot; Mr. Hayes methodicallydemolishes the prettified image of the martyred gorilla loverconveyed in the unstintingly dumb movie &quot;Gorillas in theMist&quot; and discusses in detail what the film -- and theautobiography it was based on -- left out. In the place ofSigourney Weaver's Radcliffe-Goes-to-Rwanda savior ofmountain gorillas, we now are face to face with a brute: avindictive, egomaniacal misanthrope whose love of theendangered mountain gorilla eventually led her to flogpoachers' genitals, smear them with excrement, kidnap theirchildren, gun down peasants' livestock, and generally makelife unpleasant for anyone who fooled around with herpersonal primates.</LP><TEXT>   She was not without grievance. Where the movie shows Ms.Fossey merely being kicked out of the Belgian Congo duringits ferocious civil war of the middle 1960s, the bookinvestigates Ms. Fossey's oft-repeated assertion that she wasgang-raped by Congolese troops, shortly before three of heryoung human proteges either were eaten or burned alive. Thiswould seem to explain, without condoning, her animosity forAfricans the rest of her life, an animosity so profound thatthe greatest mystery about her unsolved murder in 1985 is notwho did it but why it took so long to happen.   &quot;I told her that if she stayed, I fully expected she wouldhave her throat cut by the end of the year,&quot; her formerfiance, a white African, told Mr. Hayes. &quot;It was absolutelyludicrous to live on a mountain out there, harassing a bunchof poachers and expecting to stay alive.&quot;   &quot;Dark Romance&quot; is a very fine book, but a very depressingone. What makes it all the more depressing is that Mr. Hayes,a former editor of Esquire who recently died of a braintumor, is no longer around to accept praise -- or fend offattacks -- for a book sure to be unpopular with admirers ofthe Sigourneyized Fossey. We read about an unglamorous,reclusive, sexually unfulfilled physical therapist who hadspent 10 undistinguished years in Louisville, Ky., before shedecided to visit friends in Africa. There she fell in lovewith the exceedingly rare mountain gorilla, and spent therest of her life in a suicidal war with poachers and farmersdetermined to make the gorillas even more rare.   Along the way, there was her capture by the Congolese (Mr.Hayes seems to doubt that she was raped, but others don't),the murder of her assistants, two abortions, incessant healthproblems, and no money. Meanwhile, poachers periodically werechopping off the heads, hands and feet of her belovedgorillas, whose number at one point had dwindled to around210 (they are now back above 300). That she survived as longas she did Mr. Hayes attributes to her convincing the localsthat she was a witch.   Most certainly, she was an extremely lonely woman whoinvariably sought to bed down with the men who came to workwith her, then harassed them if they refused her advances.Mr. Hayes portrays her as a manipulative back-stabber whowould do anything to get her way, though, considering theline of work she was in, a bit of manipulative back-stabbinghardly seems excessive. The gorillas were getting stabbed inthe front.   If the book has a failing, it is Mr. Hayes's insufficientawe of Ms. Fossey's immense physical courage. But he is righton target when he wonders about the wisdom of havingwell-meaning white women from Louisville telling dirt-poorblacks from one of the most densely populated countries inAfrica what they should be doing with their land, animals andtime. He particularly faults her for encouraging her staff tofire on poachers. Once the shooting started, the localsretaliated by killing off six gorillas. The man who startedthe shooting, Alan Goodall, now laments: &quot;It was as thoughRwanda had become our own private empire, with no sense ofresponsibility on our part to those involved . . . I had thefeeling after I left that the African people wanted to seeall the gorillas killed so that all of us would leave.&quot;   Mr. Hayes also believes that Ms. Fossey was wrong toreject appeals to turn the preserve into a touristattraction, arguing that the best way to save an endangeredspecies is by providing locals with a powerful economicmotive for keeping them alive. In fact, the only trulyhumorous passage in the book concerns a young surfer from SanDiego who worked for a few months as a volunteer in Ms.Fossey's camp, and who tried to convince her of the virtuesof free enterprise.   &quot;I said, `Dian, this is nuts, man. You call up Yamaha andHonda and you get them a deal that says you'll publicizetheir equipment, and they'll give them (motorcycles) to youfor free. And you can do five days' work in four hours] Youdon't have to walk a mile-and-a-half an hour up a verticalhillside. You sit on a motorcycle, and putt-putt-putt, you'rethere. That'll scare the hell out of the poachers.&quot;   No, it wouldn't.</TEXT></DOC>
