The move is likely to accelerate independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's timetable for seeking fraud, conspiracy and other charges against former White House aides Oliver North and John Poindexter, and against Albert Hakim, a middleman in arms sales to Iran and to Nicaraguan rebels, know as Contras.    The documents were expected months earlier, but appeals and Swiss court proceedings held up their release. Prosecutors were concerned that they could be delivered as late as January.    A spokesman for Mr. Walsh declined to comment. But other officials said an announcement is expected as early as tomorrow, before a scheduled visit here by the Swiss justice minister.    Mr. Walsh's team of prosecutors is expected to take several weeks to review the material, but some law enforcement officials speculated that charges could be announced as early as the end of the year. To some extent, the timing will depend on what the records disclose.    Prosecutors believe they will buttress their theories that millions of dollars of U.S. funds were diverted to help the Contras. The documents also could provide new leads about the activities of Iran-Contra figures. </TEXT></DOC>
