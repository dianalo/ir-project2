RulesAltered by U.S.To Fight Fraud---By Jeanne SaddlerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTRETAILING (RET) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Postal Service's Board of Governors adopted a rule change that gives recipients of collect-on-delivery parcels the option of paying for the packages with personal checks made out to the sender.    Postal officials said they expect the change to significantly reduce mail fraud connected with such deliveries because customers could stop payment on their personal checks if they discover the merchandise isn't what they ordered. The officials estimate that mail fraud connected with c.o.d. merchandise is responsible for consumer and business losses of as much as $75 million annually.    Under current postal regulations, recipients of c.o.d. parcels are required to either pay for the package with cash or with a check made payable to the Postal Service. The agency then issues a money order to the company that mailed the item.    Customers must pay the mail carrier before opening such parcels, leaving them vulnerable to fraud if the packages are empty or filled with worthless items. About 5% of all c.o.d. parcels in 1985 were directly connected to fraudulent schemes, postal officials said.    Although there was speculation that the board would decide to seek a postal rate increase at its monthly meeting yesterday in Dallas, Chairman John Griesemer said the board will wait until it has more information on such factors as the coming labor negotiations and the new federal retirement system.    Postal rates will remain stable for the rest of this year and during much of 1988, Mr. Griesemer said. But he added that a decision on a rate increase can't be delayed indefinitely. The new federal retirement system that took effect this year will cost the agency an extra $400 million this fiscal year and about $1.4 billion during fiscal 1988. The Postal Service will begin negotiating a new three-year contract with its major unions April 22.    Separately, the board approved the construction of new mail processing centers in the Atlanta and Dallas metropolitan areas.    The North Georgia Mail Processing Center will be built on a 97-acre site in Gwinett County and the board said it will spend as much as $82 million on the facility. The panel also committed itself to spending as much as $72.1 million for the new North Dallas Mail Processing Center.    Both sites are expected to be completed in the spring of 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
