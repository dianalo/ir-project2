The men, along with their families, flew in from the DominicanRepublic, said Perry Rivkind, district director of the U.S.Immigration and Naturalization Service.   ``At this point I'm holding them for a while,'' Rivkind said.``I'm not going to make a final determination until I talk to theDepartment of State.''   He said a decision on whether to free the officers during asylumproceedings could come as early as Thursday, however.   The weekend coup attempt against the government of Lt. Gen.Prosper Avril was led by Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, 38, head of thecrack Leopard Battalion, Col. Philippe Biamby, 36, of the palaceguard, and Col. Leonce Qualo, 35, head of the Interior Ministry'sintelligence department.   Avril ordered the three expelled from Haiti on Tuesday.   Rivkind said the officers arrived from the Dominican Republicwith valid Haitian passports and U.S. tourist visas allowing themto stay in the country for six months.   But by asking for asylum, they forfeited the tourist visas andcould legally be detained. Rivkind said he was intially inclined toparole them, but after determining their high rank, decided toconsult with the State Department first.   Meanwhile, the situation in Haiti was tense Wednesday after moreofficers took to the the radio demanding Avril's ouster, and thegovernment declared a state of emergency and a news blackout.</TEXT></DOC>
