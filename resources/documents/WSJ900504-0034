The award to Robert Kanuth by a three-member arbitrationpanel of the National Association of Securities Dealers isone of the largest such awards in the securities business,attorneys said.</LP><TEXT>   The magnitude of the award -- which included $1 millioneach for defamation and punitive damages -- stunned attorneysfor Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., the Kemper unit that lostthe case.   &quot;This will set the arbitration process back 50 years,&quot;said Edward Foote, a lawyer for Chicago-based Winston andamp;Strawn, who represented Prescott. &quot;It's an outrage -- the mandeserves nothing.&quot;   Attorneys representing Prescott declined to say whetherthe award will be appealed. But winning appeals inarbitration cases is very difficult because the FederalArbitration Act provides a narrow window for reversing suchdecisions.   &quot;Historically, there is a finality&quot; to arbitration awards,says Richard P. Ryder, editor of the Securities ArbitrationCommentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter. &quot;The idea is thatan arbitration panel wouldn't be overturned unless you canprove that in some way the arbitrators were manifestlyunjust.&quot;   The case grew out of a dispute following the sale of Mr.Kanuth's public financing underwriting business to Prescottin September 1987. The contract provided for an upfrontpayment of $11.3 million to Mr. Kanuth, in addition to aseries of payments over five years relating to the profit ofthe company, which was to be run by Mr. Kanuth andincorporated as a unit of Prescott.   But after a series of disputes between Mr. Kanuth andvarious Prescott executives, Mr. Kanuth filed a federal courtsuit alleging breach of contract. He was fired shortlythereafter.   In turn, Prescott filed an arbitration case before theNASD seeking damages for, among other things, alleged breachof fiduciary duty by Mr. Kanuth in his role as an officer ofthe Prescott public finance unit.   The case, consolidated before the NASD panel, was complex:Arbitrators heard testimony from 40 witnesses over 22 days ofhearings comprising nearly 7,000 pages of written transcriptand about 1,200 exhibits.   The arbitration panel found that Prescott &quot;actedimproperly&quot; in dismissing Mr. Kanuth, noting that theemployment contract permitted dismissal only &quot;upon verylimited circumstances.&quot; It thus awarded Mr. Kanuth salaryover five years and incentive compensation totaling more than$33 million.   Moreover, the panel found that Prescott -- in telling theNASD that Mr. Kanuth was terminated for corporate waste andmismanagement -- defamed Mr. Kanuth. It thus awarded him anadditional $1 million.   Thomas Gottschalk, Mr. Kanuth's attorney at Kirkland andamp;Ellis in Washington, said Prescott officials also &quot;threatenedto suffocate&quot; his client's business, and told him he would&quot;never earn a dime&quot; if he pursued his claim.   &quot;The conduct of Prescott . . . was extreme andoutrageous,&quot; the panel's findings said, and caused Mr. Kanuthemotional distress. The result: An additional $3 millionaward, plus $1 million for punitive damages.   The panel ordered Prescott to file within 30 days anamended termination report with the NASD, reflecting that Mr.Kanuth's termination resulted from a contractual dispute --not from corporate waste or other mismanagement.</TEXT></DOC>
