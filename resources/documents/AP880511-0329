The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 44.27 points at1,959.38 at 2 p.m. EDT, widened from its losses earlier in thesession.   The broader market also showed deep declines. Losing stocksoutstripped advancers by about 7-to-1 on the New York StockExchange, with 1,375 issues losing, only 200 gaining and 336unchanged.   Volume on the Big Board was 138.82 million shares.   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank boosted their prime rates by ahalf percentage point to 9 percent. They were the first increasesin the prime since just before October's stock market collapse.   Chase was the first big bank to raise the key rate, which iswatched closely because bankers use it as a base rate for loans tomany businesses and for consumer loans, including mortgages.Chase's move was announced around noon today after Wall Street hadalready sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears.   ``It tends to reduce confidence in the stock market,'' said HughJohnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp. in Albany,N.Y., referring to the increase in the prime rate.   Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend todampen companies' expansion plans and investments.   The hike in the prime came against a background of growingedginess about the outlook for interest rates.   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicatedearlier today that there could be an internationally coordinatedboost in rates.   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the WallStreet Journal's overseas editions that was published today, notedthat a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and other leadingnations to hike interest rates ``is certainly possible'' followingthe Federal Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S.inflation.   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed thatthe Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defendedthe move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recentgrowth in the money supply.   Some observers and market players expect the Fed to raise itskey discount rate, the interest it charges big financialinstitutions, possibly this week.   The NYSE's composite index was down 2.59 at 143.16.   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index haddropped 4.72 to 295.09.</TEXT></DOC>
