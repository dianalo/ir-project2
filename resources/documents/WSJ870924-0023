Mr. Costello would succeed Richard Godwin, who quit the post earlier this month after a series of frustrating run-ins with the military services and other parts of the defense secretary's office. The job -- officially called the undersecretary for acquisition and informally labeled the acquisition czar -- is considered the cornerstone of a defense-overhaul bill enacted last year in the wake of weapons-buying scandals.    Mr. Godwin told Congress this week that the Defense Department wasn't &quot;prepared to move ahead with the new acquisition system.&quot;    Mr. Costello, 61 years old, was in charge of purchasing activities for General Motors Corp. before assuming his current Pentagon job in 1982. His nomination requires Senate confirmation.    Disappointed that the first acquisition czar felt stymied, Congress will be inclined to watch the second. The Armed Services Committees of both chambers have already held hearings on the matter and may call for further reviews if the military bureaucracy appears to be systematically blocking the changes Congress legislated last year to clean up the weapons-buying system. </TEXT></DOC>
