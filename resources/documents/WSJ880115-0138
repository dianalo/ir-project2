So why is he waiting in line at a relief center for a handout of corn meal and canned sardines?    &quot;Let me tell you who's really suffering in this country,&quot; he says. It isn't the black workers, &quot;who are always going on strike for more money,&quot; he claims. It is people like him, working-class whites, whose wages aren't keeping pace with the 17% inflation rate and whose labor mobility is being crowded by advancing blacks. Mr. Fourie's take-home pay from his job at the provincial public-works department is about 600 rand ($306) a month, not enough to pay all the bills and feed his six growing children, he says.    His wife, Magda, chokes back tears as she describes her family's hardships: &quot;My kids don't get sweets. When they take bread to school, there is only butter spread on it.&quot; Mr. Fourie, draping an arm around his wife, adds softly, &quot;We never thought it could get like this for us.&quot;    It may be difficult to imagine, but in South Africa, where being white used to guarantee economic comfort, the breadline is becoming integrated. &quot;For the first time in years, some whites are ending up losers,&quot; says Nico Czypionka, the chief economist at Standard Bank.    The Fouries are one of 3,000 white families that get food and second-hand clothes at the &quot;Work and Survive&quot; center on the northern fringe of Pretoria, just across town from government headquarters. Their tales of woe have a common theme: Apartheid isn't protecting them the way it used to. One young man, out of work for two years, says all the jobs he applies for are being filled by blacks; another man, nearing retirement, bitterly complains that the wages of his black colleagues are rising faster than his.    &quot;It's quite pathetic, the stories you hear,&quot; says Kleintjie Pereira, who operates the privately funded center. &quot;You just can't turn them away.&quot;    They started flocking for help two years ago, when the economy hit the skids and the rest of the world began heaping on economic sanctions. Since then, official white unemployment has doubled, to about 30,000, and many more whites with unskilled jobs have been pushed below the poverty line by inflation.    These poor whites are even missing out on the country's nascent economic recovery. Economic output, stagnant for two years, rose about 2% in 1987, and it may climb 3% this year. Business confidence, capital investment and consumer spending are all up. So is the price of gold, the country's main foreign-currency earner. &quot;Lo and behold,&quot; says Finance Minister Barend du Plessis, &quot;South Africa still stands.&quot;    This is little comfort for Johanna Kruger, who feels the government could do more to alleviate the poverty plaguing her white, blue-collar neighborhood east of downtown Johannesburg. &quot;Sure, things are improving, but who are they improving for? The blacks,&quot; she says with disgust. &quot;For whites like us, things are bad and getting badder.&quot;    They would have to get a lot worse to approach the deprivations suffered by most South African blacks. And though unemployment is up sharply, it still is less than 2% of the white labor force, in contrast to estimates of the black jobless rate that run as high as 40%.    Still, the pain of people like Mrs. Kruger is acute enough to trigger a white backlash against the ruling National Party, which has held power for 40 years by taking care of its own. She and her husband and their 11-year-old son occupy a tiny four-room, government-subsidized apartment that isn't much bigger than the matchbox houses common in the black townships. The ceilings leak, and the other night she saw mice scampering up her bedroom wall.    At the end of last year, her husband lost his job as a security guard, meaning that her take-home pay of 400 rand a month, from her job as a nurse's aide, will have to do. &quot;We're trying to get up, but we just can't,&quot; she says.    For decades, there was no question of whites falling; apartheid propped them up. In the blue-collar sector, &quot;job reservation,&quot; a tenet of apartheid, made sure that the most important jobs, such as those of factory foreman and mine overseer, remained white. Education and skill mattered little. And a burgeoning bureaucracy made sure there were plenty of white-collar jobs.    But the economic recession and the political turmoil of the past two years have combined to diminish many competitive advantages enjoyed by working-class whites. The new militancy of black unions has prompted the government to scrap most aspects of job reservation and has forced employers to raise wages of blacks, often at the expense of whites who never had a need for strong unions.    In the industrial sector, black wages have generally kept pace with inflation, while white wages have fallen short by about 4% annually. This has had the effect of narrowing the once-huge gap between white and black pay levels.    &quot;When you uplift one element of the work force, someone has to pay for it. That's the white blue-collar worker,&quot; says Mr. Czypionka, the Standard Bank economist. &quot;He may not be aware of the exact facts of how he's being affected, but he sure feels it.&quot;    Viewed from his 20th-floor office in downtown Johannesburg, the working-class white neighborhoods trail off toward the east. Dirkie Conradie lives in one of those suburbs, Malvern, where he shares a two-room apartment with a pensioner named Shorty.    For 40 years, Mr. Conradie traveled around South Africa, working almost every day painting new buildings. Two years ago, the construction business went bust, and so did Mr. Conradie, who is 62 years old. Today, he works as an odd-jobs man at the Jimmy O'Connor Welfare Services Club, a private organization that runs welfare programs, including soup kitchens.    The job pays 300 rand a month; when he was painting, he made that much every week. Forced to scrimp, he tried giving up smoking, but couldn't, so he cut down on his gasoline consumption instead. Now, he uses his car only to get to work.    &quot;I'm telling you, there is no work for whites in the building industry. What work there is is done by blacks,&quot; he says. &quot;When I started, painting was a skilled trade with a five-year apprenticeship. Now, three weeks and you're a painter.&quot;    Mr. Conradie spreads the blame willy-nilly for his plight: on the government for inflation, on the Americans and other foreigners for sanctions. But the real culprit, he contends, is black overpopulation and the erosion of apartheid.    When he was growing up, &quot;they lived on their side and we lived on ours,&quot; he says. &quot;Now you've got people of color moving into Malvern, and the whites move out. That's what has happened to the economy, too. The blacks move in and the whites move out.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
