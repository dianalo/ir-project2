These are 'accidental'relations between couplings in the low-energy effective action whichcannot be understood in terms of the symmetries of that action. It isshown that the existence of (0,2) models need not be a string miracle,but can often be understood in terms of a discrete R symmetry. This understandingpoints to many new (0,2) models, including some with gauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1).Discrete R symmetries also protect some massless particles from acquiringa mass at special points in the moduli space of the conformal field theory.From a two dimensional point of view, this can be understood in termsof index theorems not only in the R but also in the NS sector. An importanttool in the study of string compactification and conformal field theoryis the perturbative expansion around a conformal field theory. We provethat the expansion of the space time superpotential around a space-timesupersymmetric vacuum does not miss non-perturbative effects (as longas we do not expand around a boundary of moduli space). This shows thtcertain results which have been obtained to all orders in this expansionare exact. Also, it shows that the construction of the (0,2) models inperturbation theory around (2,2) models is exact as well.</TEXT></DOC>
