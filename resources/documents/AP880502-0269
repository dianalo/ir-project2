Saudi Arabia's oil minister said today he was pleased by thecollapse of the OPEC talks, which were rescheduled for June 8.   ``It's a very happy ending'' to a week of intense bargaining,the minister, Hisham Nazer, told reporters as he left the finalsession early this morning.   His comment confirmed that Saudi Arabia has adopted a hard-linestance against any production cuts that could give oil prices aboost. A chief beneficiary of higher prices would be Iran, whichrelies on oil to finance its war with Iraq.   Last Tuesday, the Saudi government broke diplomatic relationswith Iran, accusing Tehran of terrorism and subversion.   The breakdown of negotiations caused oil prices to fall.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediateoil, the U.S. benchmark crude, was down 75 cents a barrel to $17.24in early trading.   In earlier Tokyo trading, the price of Brent crude oil from theNorth Sea was quoted at $16.20 a barrel, down 45 cents from theclose in Europe on Friday.   The London spot, or non-contract, market was closed for the MayDay holiday, and trading elsewhere in Europe was extremely light.   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said he was notworried by the short-term reaction of traders in the free market.   ``People who look at the price on Tuesday and beyond should takeheart ... that OPEC is trying to put its house in order,'' he said.   Other ministers expressed disappointment at the breakdown ofnegotiations, which they viewed as a chance to shore up oil pricesand open a new avenue to cooperation with non-OPEC producers whohad proposed the production cuts.   ``I would be much happier if we could have agreed on cuts now,''said Libyan oil minister Fawzi Shakshuki.   The production cutting proposal was aimed at raising prices toOPEC's target of $18 a barrel, from the current range of $14 to$16, by tightening supplies.   Saudi Arabia led a minority of four cartel members opposing theproposed production cut of 300,000 barrels a day, or about 2percent of the group's total output.   The cuts were to be made in conjunction with the six non-OPECproducers, who offered to reduce their output by 5 percent, orabout 200,000 barrels a day, if the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries would do likewise.   Failure by OPEC to decide on a response to the offer was likelyto draw criticism from the independent producers, who met with anOPEC committee in Vienna last Tuesday and Wednesday.   Rilwanu Lukman, the president of OPEC, said the cartel leaderswould resume their debate on possible cuts in production at theirregular summer session in Vienna on June 8.   ``More time is required to clarify some of the points of theoffer,'' Lukman told a news conference this morning. He said thatin the meantime OPEC members would ``do their utmost'' to abide bytheir assigned production quotas, which are scheduled to expireJune 30.   The quotas, agreed on last December, are designed to support anoil price of $18. OPEC prices have dropped several dollars belowthe target price this spring, however, prompting the cartel to seekcollaboration with outside producers.   The six countries involved in the talks with OPEC were Mexico,Egypt, China, Malaysia, Oman and Angola.   OPEC has solicited the cooperation of independent producerssince the start of this decade, when the development of a world oilglut began chipping away at OPEC's ability to dictate prices.   In 1986, oil prices collapsed, falling to less than $10 a barrelin July from nearly $30 the previous November.   All OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia, have said they wantto foster closer ties with independent oil producers.   The Saudis, however, say they think the non-OPEC countriesshould bear a bigger share of the burden of reducing supplies. Inthe Vienna meeting Nazer proposed a barrel-for-barrel reductionwith the non-OPEC group, sources said.   In supporting his stand against the proposed cuts, Nazer toldthe closed-door meeting that Saudi Arabia has cut its oil output inrecent years from 9.9 million barrels a day to 4.3 million _ a farlarger reduction than any other OPEC member, according to a sourcewho was in the meeting.   The Saudis were supported by their main allies, Kuwait, Qatarand the United Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
