With dissension only from Libya, the 11-member Organization ofArab Petroleum Exporting Countries voted to reinstate Egypt.   The vote was the clearest signal to date that Egypt was likelyto be allowed into a May 23-24 Arab summit in Casablanca, Morocco.Egypt's participation would be tantamount to regaining its place inthe Arab League, sources say.   Egypt was forced out of the 22-member Arab League and mostaffiliated institutions after it signed the 1979 Camp David accordswith Israel. The boycott gradually eroded with restoration ofbilateral ties by most Arab countries and reinstatement of Egypt inseveral specialized affiliate bodies of the Arab League.   Only Syria and Libya have taken a hard line against readmittingCairo to the Arab fold.   At the opening session of the Kuwait-based OAPEC conferenceSaturday, chairman Mana Saeed Otaiba, the oil minister of theUnited Arab Emirates, called for reinstating Egypt.   ``The Arab family will remain incomplete as long as Egyptremains outside,'' Otaiba said.   Syria recently has moderated its stance against Egypt.   ``I think that no Arab will oppose Egypt's return to Araborganizations because Egypt is a sister state,'' said Syrian oilminister, Mutanius Habib shortly after arriving.   The conference communique mentioned that Libyan oil ministerFawzi Shakshouki expressed reservations about readmitting Egypt butdid not say what they were.   Shakshouki said before the conference began that Libya stillopposed Egypt's reinstatement and said his country would continueto do so ``as long as the causes of its suspension did not vanish.''   OAPEC was founded in 1968 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya as aforum for promoting Arab oil policies. Other members are Iraq, theUnited Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Bahrain, Syria andEgypt. The first seven countries also sit on the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</TEXT></DOC>
