The company, serving about 3.2 million Michigan telephonecustomers, wants to trim its white-collar workforce of 4,200 byabout 850, President Kenneth E. Millard said.   Total employment at Michigan Bell is about 17,700, down frommore than 19,300 two years ago. Cuts in other areas may beconsidered later, spokesman Greg Gordon said.   For now, the company is offering incentives to lure workers intoearly retirement.   Competition authorized since January 1988 for long-distance andWATS (wide area telephone service) business will cost Michigan Bellan estimated $120 million by the end of 1990, including loss ofabout 10 percent of its long-distance market and 30 percent of itsWATS line market, Millard said.   ``Like other deregulating industries, we're taking steps to makethe transition to a non-monopoly, competitive businessenvironment,'' Millard said. Michigan Bell reported net income of$316.8 million on revenues of $2.46 billion in 1988, compared with$307.9 million on revenues of $2.34 billion in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
