This computerization permitsuniform testing while avoiding discrepancies in test data associatedwith operator discretion. All test procedures must be completed and allsteps must be executed sequentially. Uniform testing ensures that testconditions are the same from one engine to the next and that consistentlyaccurate readings are taken at the correct time. Part I describes thefacility. Part II describes the system configuration. Part III followsan engine through several phases of a normal test cycle.</TEXT></DOC>
