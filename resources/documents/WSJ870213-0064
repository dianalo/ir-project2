PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Big companies such as Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co., with $8.6 billion in annual sales, usually don't overreach.    But yesterday, Minnesota Mining got carried away.    At 11 a.m. EST yesterday, the maker of consumer and industrial products breathlessly announced it was about to unveil &quot;a major, positive business transaction.&quot; Excited investors pumped the stock up to $139 a share -- a $7.50-a-share jump -- in 20 minutes. New York Stock Exchange officials hastily halted trading in Minnesota Mining to await the big announcement.    An hour later the company disclosed it was buying Unitek Corp., a Monrovia, Calif., maker of dental braces, from Bristol-Myers Co. The announcement of a relatively minor acquisition drew disappointed groans from analysts. It sent Minnesota Mining's stock plunging nearly $8 a share within six minutes after trading resumed. It closed in composite trading at $131.25, up 25 cents for the day.    Industry experts pronounced Minnesota Mining's performance &quot;quite extraordinary.&quot; Eugene G. Glazer, who follows the company for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said, &quot;Somebody made a substantial error in judgment.&quot; Some analysts complained the company had raised expectations that it was about to shed its slow-moving floppy disk and videotape units. &quot;Money was lost,&quot; Mr. Glazer said.    Big Board officials immediately said they would take a hard, close look at Minnesota Mining's trading. One exchange official described the company's hyperbole as &quot;pure stupidity.&quot;    Chagrined Minnesota Mining officials later agreed. &quot;Our intentions were pure,&quot; said a company spokesman, &quot;but if we had it to do over again, we wouldn't.&quot;    &quot;It's a matter of perspective,&quot; another spokesman said. &quot;The dental products division doesn't usually make major acquisitions.&quot;    For the record, Minnesota Mining said Unitek makes braces and other orthodontic appliances and employs about 1,200 employees in the U.S. and 150 employees in six other countries. Both Minnesota Mining and Bristol-Myers declined to disclose the terms of the transaction, but industry experts said the sale price was less than $100 million. </TEXT></DOC>
