WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Democratic presidential nominee MichaelDukakis told new Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemptoday there is a ``yawning gap'' between his optimistic talk aboutsolving urban problems and President Bush's federal budget proposal.   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, injected a reminder ofthe 1988 presidential campaign with his remarks to Kemp during theannual winter meeting of the National Governors' Association.   The HUD secretary, who himself sought the Republican presidentialnomination last year, described his hopes for using tax incentivesand private enterprise to reinvigorate cities to a committee of theassociation.   When Kemp took questions from the governors, Dukakis said ``Iapplaud'' Kemp's efforts and noted many of his proposals havealready been put to work by states and cities.   But Dukakis then asked him to reconcile his enthusiastic talkabout solving problems of poverty, homelessness and housing withBush's budget, which would provide no new spending for subsidizedhousing and would cut some federal money to states and cities.   ``On the other hand, as I look over the president's budget, thereis a yawning gap between what you're saying and what's in there,''Dukakis said.   He pointed to Bush's proposal to further cut back the CommunityDevelopment Block Grant program, which Dukakis said governments useas public capital to attract additional private investment inhousing and other development projects.   ``The budget does need some reworking,'' Dukakis said.   Kemp responded, ``I think the president, despite criticism to thecontrary, has evidenced a good faith effort to work with theCongress.'' He said ``it's obligatory upon the Congress'' to work incooperation with the president on the budget.   Kemp cited the restraints on the federal budget but pledged, ``Ican assure you that I am going to do everything I can to make surethat there is adequate funding for those programs that work.''   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, declined an invitation tomeet with the governors. But they heard a frank assessment Sundayfrom the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. James Sasser,who warned, ``We're fresh out of cash here in Washington.''   An Associated Press survey of governors before their arrivalfound that most state executives respect Bush's ``no new taxes''pledge and are holding off on calls for raising revenue to reducethe federal deficit.   Governors in both parties said that Bush's promise of a ``kinder,gentler America'' suggested his administration will be morereceptive to state needs than was President Reagan, whoseadministration dramatically reduced federal aid flowing to states.   ``I think he's already shown himself more receptive to domesticproblems,'' said Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, whocited housing as the top domestic need.   Michigan's Democratic Gov. James Blanchard said Bush ``has thepotential of being, from Michigan's point of view, a betterpresident than Ronald Reagan. Not necessarily more popular, but morecompassionate.''   At the same time, however, governors voiced concern that Bush'sproposed federal budget for fiscal 1990 will bring another round ofdomestic spending cuts that will require increased spending by thestates.   ``We won't become a `kinder and gentler' nation until we addressour domestic needs, such as children at risk, the homeless and thementally ill,'' said Washington state's Democratic Gov. BoothGardner.   Bush's 1988 Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis, said he'd wait to see whether Bush follows through ondomestic needs.   ``I hope so, but I'm very concerned about his budget, which islooking for cuts of over $5 billion in Medicare and a number ofother areas which will have a devastating effect on health care andimportant human needs,'' Dukakis said.   Wyoming's Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan gave Bush ``generallygood marks for at least establishing a kinder and gentler theme, adesire to work cooperatively with the states.''   The governors received a grim budget assessment from Sasser,however, who said Bush's budget is based on overly optimisticeconomic assumptions and leaves the tough decisions about where tocut domestic spending up to Congress.   ``The sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that there'ssubstantial pain to be portioned out to the American people and I'msorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to stateand local government is, once again, very substantial,'' said Sasser.   He said that while Bush has asked for a line-item veto power overthe budget, a tool many governors have, ``he refuses to offer theCongress this year a line-item budget.'' Bush's budget proposalcalls for spending limits without specifying many of the cuts thatwill be needed to accomplish the goals.   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, voiced concern thatBush's budget proposal has no money for the $800 million jobtraining program that was part of the welfare reform pushed by thegovernors and enacted by Congress.   Blanchard said the states are hard-pressed to deal with newobligations mandated by the federal government, such as for expandedMedicaid coverage, without money to pay for them.   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger spoke to the governorsand cautioned against high expectations of expanded trade with theSoviet Union.   To Iowa's Gov. Terry Branstad, who asked about the prospects ofincreased trade with the Soviets, Kissinger said, ``I don't thinkit's going to stimulate the economy of your state during your termof office.''   The governors' association executive committee approvedresolutions putting the governors on record in support ofself-determination for Puerto Rico, uniform poll closing timesacross the country, and easier voter registration.   But a deficit-reduction plan that could have called for highertaxes under certain circumstances was withheld from a vote when whatappeared to be a bipartisan consensus fell apart.   The co-chairmen of the governors' task force that worked on theplan, Democrat Mario Cuomo of New York and Republican CarrollCampbell of South Carolina, backed off late last week after Cuomosaid it would incorporate a federal tax increase. Campbell saidthrough spokesman Tucker Eskew that he wanted to strike languagecalling for higher taxes even ``in a doomsday scenario.''</TEXT></DOC>
