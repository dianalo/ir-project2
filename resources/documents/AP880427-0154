Col. Oliver L. North's secret notebooks sincelearning about their whereabouts from North's former secretary,independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said Wednesday.   Walsh, testifying at a pre-trial hearing in the Iran-Contraconspiracy case, said former National Security Council secretaryFawn Hall reported seeing the notebooks in the office of North'sattorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.   ``Fawn Hall had seen the notebooks in your office and we weretrying to get you to admit that you had them or that Colonel Northhad them,'' Walsh said under questioning by Sullivan.   ``We subpoenaed you and tried to get the information; youresisted,'' Walsh said.   Ms. Hall, who was North's secretary at the NSC, is cooperatingwith Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair under a grantof immunity from prosecution.   She is listed as a prospective trial witness against North,former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and armsdealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord. No date has been set for the trial.   Walsh did not explain why his office was unable to obtain thediaries.   North's nearly 3,000 pages of diary entries are the subject of afresh subpoena issued this week by the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee to assist a subcommittee probe of alleged drugtrafficking and money laundering.   Subcommittee Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., has said thepossibility exists that the Contra rebels profited from the drugtrade to finance the purchase of arms and supplies.   The legal fight between Walsh and Sullivan is under court sealbecause it relates to the grand jury investigation, but it ispresumed that Sullivan successfully invoked attorney-clientprivilege in refusing to answer questions about the documents'whereabouts.   Walsh said his office had tried to determine if North hadpossession of the documents ``so we could subpoena them.''Prosecutors then learned from Fawn Hall that the notebooks were inSullivan's office, Walsh said.   The congressional committees that investigated the Iran-Contraaffair were given censored versions of 1,269 pages of the 2,848pages of North's diaries.   Seventy-four heavily censored pages were released Tuesday byKerry. They were sprinkled with references to drugs, the DrugEnforcement Administration and the CIA. Panamanian strongman Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drugcharges, was also mentioned.</TEXT></DOC>
