So far, the university has not decided to lay off anyone.;   And looming ominously over the shortfall are expected cuts in academicprograms.;    But after taking a closer look at the budget, Rosse found thatthe deficit would increase about 25 percent. And in his original projection,Rosse said the university would spend $10 million of its reserves this year.The medical school said it would spend another $12 million.;    The reservesare normally treated like Stanford's $2 billion endowment. But the universityis severely limited in when it can spend the endowment. It can spend thereserves whenever it wants. And Stanford has dipped into its reserves duringother financial binds, said William Massy, the university's chief financialofficer.;    Stanford hit hard times when the federal government last week cutthe university's overhead rate for the fourth time since school started, areduction of $28 million in all. At the beginning of the term, Stanfordexpected to receive $125 million in overhead, its second-largest source ofannual income after tuition.;    Few strings attached;  Overhead includesitems that cannot easily be associated with a specific research project,things such as utilities, building depreciation, library use andadministration. The university can use the money any way it wants.;   Stanford's financial situation could dramatically worsen if the university hasto pay back the $150 million to $180 million that federal auditors say theuniversity overcharged taxpayers for overhead during the 1980s.;    But evenwithout having to repay that much, the Stanford campus is gripped in its ownversion of the recession. Stanford's best estimate is that the university andmedical school will spend $30 million in reserves in this fiscal year, whichends Aug. 31, and $40 million the following fiscal year. But Rosse said thattotal could be as high as $86 million or as low as $54 million.;    Lookingahead;  The budget cuts have led many on the 8,200-acre campus to wonder howthis will affect the university in the long run. Professors at the facultysenate meeting asked whether Stanford would have to turn its focus away fromthe research that has been so instrumental in helping build its reputation.;   &quot;Deciding what kind of institution we will be has to have the highestpriority in the next six to nine months,&quot; Rosse said.;    English ProfessorHerbert Lindenberger feared that humanities departments would suffer the bruntof the budget cuts because, unlike the hard sciences, they bring in fewoverhead dollars.;    But Fabian Pease, a professor of electrical engineering,said in an interview the most common emotion is one of uncertainty. &quot;A lot ofpeople are looking around saying, 'How are we going to make do without thismoney?' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JEFF GOTTLIEB, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  676  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131093,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
