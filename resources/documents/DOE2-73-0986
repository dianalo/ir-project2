During that time there have been reports of employees experiencingvisual disturbances as a result of exposure to these amines. Some ofthese accounts have reported visual disturbances occurring at exposurelevels below present limits. This study was conducted to define visualeffects experienced by employees and to determine ambient concentrationsat which effects were occurring. Study results suggest that present exposurelimits may not be adequate to prevent the occurrence of visual disturbances.Suggested exposure guidelines have been developed which, it is believed,will prevent the occurrence of these unwanted effects.</TEXT></DOC>
