Although the sale had been expected, the price was higherthan most analysts anticipated.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is a pretty good deal for Oxy,&quot; said PeterHunsberger, director of research for John S. Herold Inc., aGreenwich, Conn., petroleum research firm. The French oilcompany is paying about $10.56 per barrel of oil equivalentscompared with recent North Sea prices of $5 to $6 a barrel,Mr. Hunsberger said.   Ray Irani, Occidental's chairman, president and chiefexecutive officer, said the sale is a &quot;a major step towardOccidental's objective of reducing its debt by $3 billion&quot; bythe end of next year. &quot;With the sales announced in the first100 days of our program, we will clearly exceed our 1991goal.&quot;   However, Mr. Irani hastened to assure reporters during aconference call after the announcement that Occidental has&quot;absolutely no plans to decrease the importance of its oiland gas business.&quot; He said Occidental's strength is infinding oil and selling it at attractive prices. The NorthSea holdings represented about 13.5% of the company's oil andgas production this year, he said.   Investors reacted favorably, pushing Occidental shares up$1.25 to close at $20.25 in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading. More than 3.5 million shares changed hands.   Elf Aquitaine said it will own a two-thirds stake in thejoint venture that has agreed to acquire Occidental's UnitedKingdom oil and gas subsidiary, Occidental Petroleum (GreatBritain) Inc. London-based Enterprise Oil PLC would own theother third. Elf Aquitaine, which is majority-owned by theFrench government, already has substantial North Seaoperations.   Occidental's primary U.K. holdings include 36.5% interestsin the Piper, Saltire, Scapa and Chanter fields and 23.4% ofthe Claymore field. The company also owns a 36.5% interest inthe Flotta terminal and pipeline.   Elf Aquitaine estimates that the venture is buying 217million barrels of probable crude oil and gas-liquidsreserves, about 75 million barrels more than Occidental hadestimated, Mr. Hunsberger said. &quot;Obviously, the value . . .is in the eye of the beholder.&quot; Arcane but important taxconsiderations may also have played a role in theunexpectedly high purchase price.   The sale of the North Sea holdings also would allowOccidental to avoid spending an estimated $400 million thisyear and more next year on the Piper field, Mr. Irani said. Agiant production platform there was destroyed after anexplosion in July 1988 that killed more than 100 workers.   Occidental, which spent $200 million on exploration lastyear, plans to increase spending by about 10% to 15% thisyear, Mr. Irani reiterated. Negotiations are in the finalstages to begin oil exploration in Angola and Albania, hedisclosed for the first time.   Mr. Irani said he doesn't plan any major new announcementsat the annual meeting today, which will focus on Occidental'sprogress in the restructuring program it unveiled in January.If pending sales are completed, Occidental said it will haveraised $1.8 billion after taxes and the assumption of debt bybuyers.   Occidental expects the North Sea sale, which is subject tovarious government and regulatory approvals, to close inabout 60 days, and Mr. Irani said he doesn't see anyobstacles. He added that, &quot;based on discussions we've had,&quot;Occidental will be able to obtain financing for the $691million sale of its natural-gas-liquids business announcedearlier this week.</TEXT></DOC>
