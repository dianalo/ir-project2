Marie France Jean-Philippe testified in support of a federalsuit accusing the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ofillegally denying permits to 14,000 predominantly Haitian andMexican farmworkers in the Southeast.   The farmworkers face expulsion from the country if they cannotobtain Special Agricultural Workers permits required under the newfederal immigration law.   About 125 Haitians sat quietly in the courtroom Friday listeningto witnesses testify below a mural depicting Florida's history,including scenes showing field workers and a benevolent judge.   Ms. Jean-Philippe, 34, testified Friday she arrived in theUnited States from Haiti on a boat in 1985 and quickly got a job asa picker in Homestead.   ``First I worked in lemons, but I didn't like that _ the thornsscratched me and, anyway, I'm allergic to them,'' she said througha Creole interpreter. ``Then I went to the beans. I liked thatbetter.''   She was paid $2.50 a bushel, and sometimes made as much as $200a week, but worked from 5 a.m. to as late as 9 p.m. during theharvest, she said.   Ms. Jean-Philippe said that like many crew bosses, hers kept fewrecords, paying workers in cash at the end of the week. But whenshe applied for her work permit with the INS, he suppliedaffidavits and what documents he had.   The INS interviewer at one point made her bend down to show howshe picked beans. But she was denied a permit after the INS callednot the crew boss but the farm owner, who did not know her, shesaid.   Since the permit denial, she has been unable to work to supportherself or her three children still living in Haiti, she said.   In the suit filed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm BeachCounty, the Haitian Refugee Center and several farmworkers says theINS has failed to respect Congress' wishes.   The plaintiffs say Congress intended the INS to accept swornaffidavits as proof that farmworkers met the requirment that theyhave worked 90 days in U.S. fields prior to the law's cutoff date.   But the INS says fraud has been rampant and has insisted ondocumentary evidence, which, the plaintiffs say, often does notexist because crew bosses did not keep records for their illegalworkers.   The hearing was expected to conclude Monday. Senior U.S.District Judge C. Clyde Atkins, who is presiding over the case,said he would not rule immediately.</TEXT></DOC>
