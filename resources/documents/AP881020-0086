The action by the Council of Ministers, in a meeting Wednesday,signaled a victory for Soviets who had deluged the press withletters complaining about the restrictions.   The council said ``huge inadequacies and oversights'' werecommitted by the Communications Ministry and State PublishingCommittee in limiting 1989 subscriptions to certain newspapers andmagazines.   Last year, it was announced that applications for 1989subscriptions would be accepted throughout 1988. In previous years,orders were taken only after Aug. 1. But when Jan. 1 rolled around,Soviets were told they could only sign up for newspapers, and hadto wait until August for magazine subscription applications.   On July 20, the Communications Ministry issued an order limitingthe number of 1989 subscriptions to their 1988 level. Furtherrestrictions applied to 41 publications, including such popularsellers as Ogonyok, Soviet Sport and Literaturnaya Gazeta.   Communications Minister Vassily A. Shamshin told the Council ofMinisters on Wednesday all the restrictions have been lifted, andthat the period during which requests for 1989 subscriptions wouldbe accepted has been extended until Nov. 15. In addition, requestsfor 1990 subscriptions will be taken beginning Jan. 2, instead ofAugust as originally scheduled.   In imposing the limits, the Communications Ministry said therewas not enough paper to print all the newspapers and magazinesneeded to keep up with demand. But in September, the governmentfound new paper supplies for next year. The CommunicationsMinistry, however, did not then lift the subscription restrictions,the council said.   Thousands of Soviets have been turned away from post officeswhere they hoped to apply for 1989 subscriptions, and some haveclaimed the paper shortage explanation was just an excuse byconservatives to stifle President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy ofopenness and his economic and social reforms.</TEXT></DOC>
