The spinoff will entail issuance of pro-rata shares in the new semiconductor company to existing shareholders in Silicon General, which makes and markets products in telecommunications, data-conversion and semiconductor businesses.    Silicon General, San Jose, Calif., said costs of the restructuring will entail an $11 million one-time charge against fourth-quarter earnings.    The company said it will report results for the fourth quarter, ended July 3, near the end of the month. In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $4,000 on revenue of $10.4 million.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Silicon General closed at $3.125 a share, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
