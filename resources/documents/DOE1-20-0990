Operationof the facility has demonstrated the technical feasibility of centralreceiver solar power plants. Commercialization of similar energy conversionfacilities is now a matter of economics. The pilot plant, commonly knownas Solar One, completed its 2-yr test and evaluation phase on July 31,1984, and proceeded into its 3-yr power production phase. During thetest and evaluation phase, the receiver, collector field, thermal storage,electric power generation, and control and plant support system wereintegrated and the plant control system was refined to allow automatedplant startup, operation in either of eight operating modes, mode transitions,and shutdown. In the power production phase, Solar One is being operatedto maximize electrical energy output to allow evaluation of the plantas a viable electrical energy production resource. During this period,operating procedures and equipment modifications are being developedto optimize plant performance. Performance data are also being evaluatedto define plant design parameters for future solar power generation facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
