There are a number of destabilising factorsat work in the world that now heighten our apprehension. He indicatesbriefly what these destabilising factors might produce. First, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union would be expected to deploy new land andsea-based missiles, modernise and replace their bombers, and introducelong-range cruise missiles, both on land and sea. The resulting &quot;balance&quot;in 1990 would show each side with approximately 15000 weapons or about5000 more than they have today. The Soviet Union would increase its advantagein missile sizes and throw-weight, while the United States would continueto lead in warheads on bombers and submarines, in the total number ofwarheads and launchers, but especially in submarines. Each side wouldhave sufficient warheads to threaten the other side's land-based continentalmissile forces, and the mode discussion that has been much in the newsrecently (mobile or otherwise) would be no longer relevant. It is possiblyno longer relevant now. That is what the authors sees for certain happeningunless something is done about it.</TEXT></DOC>
