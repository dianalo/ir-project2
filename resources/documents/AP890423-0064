Security officials said more dissidents were arrested Sunday ina roundup in the northern city of Irbid, but they would not say howmany.   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a rare foray out of Iraq,made a short visit to confer with the king, the official JordanNews Agency reported. It gave few details of their discussions.   Jordan was a key Arab ally of Baghdad in Iraq's 8-year war withIran.   Official sources said Prime Minister Zaid Rifai was not amongthe dignitaries who attended the talks with Saddam, an unusualomission.   Rioters protesting government-imposed austerity measures tocombat Jordan's economic crisis demanded Rifai's ouster, blaminghim for the problems.   Hussein met with Cabinet ministers to discuss the protests,which erupted Tuesday in the southern city of Maan and spread tomore than a dozen cities and villages before subsiding Saturday.The government said eight people were killed and 83 were wounded.   No new disturbances were reported Sunday. Police and soldierspatrolled Maan, Kerak, Salt and other cities where rioters smashedbanks, shops, government buildings and cars.   The protests, Jordan's worst unrest since the army crushedPalestinian guerrillas in 1971, broke out during the king'sweeklong visit to the United States and France. He canceled aplanned visit to Britain to return home early.   A 10 percent to 50 percent increase in prices for gasoline,cigarettes and other goods apparently sparked the unrest. The priceincreases, announced April 16, followed more than a year of fallingliving standards and rising unemployment.   The government, faced with a $6 billion debt, had to impose theausterity measures to secure loans from the International MonetaryFund and World Bank.   The violence exploded among native Jordanians, who forgenerations have formed the bedrock of support for Hussein'sHashemite dynasty.   The rioters shouted support for Hussein but called for theouster of Rifai.   The king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, said the riots wouldnot force a change of government in Jordan, a key player in theMiddle East peace process.   ``Government changes are first and foremost a decision for KingHussein,'' he was quoted as telling the Saudi Arabian newspaperAsharq Al-Awsat in an interview published Sunday.   He said government changes ``cannot take place because ofdemogoguery or pressures exercised on us.''   On his return, Hussein was met by several petitions calling fora change in the Cabinet and by at least one expressing support forhis policies.   The Unionist Democratic Association, an informal group ofprominent Jordanians, submitted a petition decrying ``the spread ofcorruption'' and calling for new economic policies, a new Cabinetand early parliamentary elections.   A similar message sent to the palace Saturday by Jordan'sprofessional associations accused the current Cabinet of becoming``more despotic'' and called for a new Cabinet, parliamentaryelections and punishment of wrongdoers in the government.</TEXT></DOC>
