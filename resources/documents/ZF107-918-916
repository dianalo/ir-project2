 This market issignificant in that board makers can sell both 80286-based 16-bitboards and 32-bit, 80386-based boards.andP;  One of the first companiesto enter the MCA board market was Capitol Equipment Corp, whichoffers two 16-bit boards and a dual 16-32-bit board.andP;  A newcomerto the market is Acculogic Inc, which introduced its first MCAmemory-board products in Sep 1989.andP;  To many observers, the growthof MCA boards is obvious.andP;  According to Len Hertzman, AST ResearchInc's senior product manager, AT and MCA machines account for 60and 40 percent of the company's sales, respectively.andP;

 The prices of 256K- and 1M-byte RAM chips have descended from thestratospheric levels inspired by the 1987 tariffs levied by the United Stateson Japan to just about where they were two years ago, and the Micro Channelarchitecture market in the United States and Europe is finally coalescing.andM;In part, the significance of this market is that board makers are able tosell both 16-bit (286-based) and 32-bit (386-based) boards.andP;  This is one areathat they missed with the introduction of 386 computers based on the ExtendedIndustry Standard Architecture.andM;Capitol Equipment Corp. of Burlington, Mass., was one of the first companiesto jump aboard the Micro Channel express.andP;  The firm offers three boards: two16-bit boards and a dual 16/32-bit board, which can plug into any MicroChannel machine from a 10MHz 286-based IBM PS/2 Model 50 to a 25MHz 386-basedModel 70.andM;According to Kerry Newcom, president of Capitol Equipment, the dual boardsenses which slot it is in and then configures itself to operate in thatenvironment.andM;Acculogic Inc. of Irvine, Calif., is a new player in the market.andP;  Thecompany's first Micro Channel memory-board products were introduced inSeptember.andP;  Mike Zachu, president of Acculogic, said that OS/2 willeventually drive greater demands for memory.andM;&quot;The PC market is in transition, what with Windows, DOS and OS/2 all fightingfor the same consumer.andP;  However, the common factor among those is the demandfor memory,&quot; he said.andM;Len Hertzman, a senior product manager with board maker AST Research Inc. ofIrvine, Calif., added that Micro Channel is where most people performmultitasking, with either Windows or Desqview, which are both notoriouslymemory-hungry.andM;&quot;Users originally thought they had enough memory [1M byte to 2M bytes] whenthey bought their systems.andP;  Now there is a more sophisticated user whorealizes how much memory they really need,&quot; he said.andM;According to Hertzman, boards for AT and Micro Channel machines account for60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of sales.andP;  He added that MicroChannel sales have increased in the last few months.andM;Board makers are closely watching the growth of the Micro Channel market.andO;Brian Kene, director of marketing and sales for Micron Technology Inc. ofBoise, Idaho, said he has seen a swing to Micro Channel systems over the pastyear and believes that movement will continue.andM;&quot;[Micron is] covered both ways -- we sell the PS/2 memory modules for theModels 70 and 80, and the 32-bit memory boards,&quot; which are compatible withany 32-bit Micro Channel machine, Kene said.andM;&quot;Micro Channel is where it's at right now.andP;  One year from now, we hope to seea 50/50 split between our 16- and 32-bit boards,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;The growth ofMicro Channel clones is a big question.andP;  This is a race that will materializein the next 12 months.&quot;andM;&quot;The [DOS-based] applications are driving the demand for more memory, andOS/2 versions [of applications] such as PageMaker and AutoCAD will drive iteven more,&quot; said Bob Kupcha, director of advanced technology and enhancementproducts at Tecmar Inc. in Solon, Ohio.andP;  &quot;In the past three months, there hasbeen a dramatic drop in memory pricing.andP;  We are now shipping 50 percent ofour memory boards with zero kilobytes [later filled with memory by the dealeror user] and 50 percent with 2M bytes.andM;&quot;The memory growth in systems is in Europe,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;We are selling moreMicro Channel memory boards over there than here.andP;  The Europeans are a bitmore forward-thinking.andP;  Business for Tecmar is up 40 percent overseas.&quot;andM;Brett Berg, a senior product marketing manager for board maker STB SystemsInc. of Richardson, Texas, agreed that the Micro Channel market is gainingsteam in Europe.andP;  &quot;[The market] is now very small, but it has seensignificant growth in the last couple of months,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;And clearly thedemand is up for the 386 computers -- we are shipping 40 percent 32-bitboards, and 60 percent are 16-bit boards.&quot;andM;Acculogic, which has entered the 16-bit Micro Channel market and plans tofollow with a 32-bit version in 1990, also sees a substantial market inEurope.andM;&quot;Europe has jumped onto [the Micro Channel systems] to a greater degree thanthe U.S.andP;  because there are more Micro Channel machines to choose from,&quot; saidAcculogic's Zachu.andP;  &quot;For Micro Channel, we are doing about 50 percent in theU.S.andP;  and 50 percent in Europe.&quot;andM;Vendors said European sales should increase even more as the effect ofdropping RAM prices works its way into the marketplace.andP;  They predict a slow,steady decline in those prices, with no surprises.andP;  But, Kene conceded, thereare a lot of unknowns, such as whether the Japanese are cutting back onproduction of 1M-byte chips, or how fast they are migrating to 4M-byte chips.andM;According to Kupcha, prices will drop another 20 percent over the next year.andO;There should be at least one drop in the next few weeks, and prices willstabilize through next summer, he added.andM;Then, when 4M-byte chips come to the market next fall, Kupcha predicted a bigdrop will take place as the producers of those chips price them aggressivelyand producers of 1M-byte chips try to stay competitive.andM;Zachu said the future for board makers looks brighter as memory prices falleven further.andM;&quot;There has been a significant drop over the last six months,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Weare getting a sense that prices are firming up now -- $2.50 is the bottom endfor 256K RAMs, and we are now seeing $8 a chip for 1M-byte chips.andP;  There is alot of oversupply and overcapacity.andP;  I think the demand will increasephenomenally.&quot;andM;Newcom of Capitol Equipment concurred.andP;  &quot;There is a huge demand for memoryready to be filled once it reaches $100 a megabyte.andP;  Everybody can use morememory, and now they can afford it,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
