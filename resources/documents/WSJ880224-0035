With the text of Mr. Peres's correspondence now splashed over the world, how many other foreign leaders will feel able to deal with any U.S. official on any project where discretion may indeed be demanded? This, it seems to us, is the only important issue raised by documents smoked out by independent counsel James McKay's investigation of Edwin Meese.    Let us deal first with the bogus issue that is supposed to justify the invasion of the private correspondence between U.S. and foreign officials. That is, that Mr. Meese must be fired, imprisoned, tarred and feathered and run out of the Beltway on a rail because he failed to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1985 when he received a memo from law-school classmate Robert Wallach that mentioned the possibility of bribing Mr. Peres to ensure that Israel wouldn't bomb the pipeline.    Now, what the memo actually said was this: Mr. Wallach described the activities of his client, Swiss wheeler-dealer Bruce Rappaport, who was trying to get financing for the project. It was a somewhat loopy idea probably never destined to go anywhere, but Israel apparently thought it might provide some kind of an opening to its Arab neighbors. Mr. Wallach's rambling memo said that Mr. Rappaport &quot;has been financing private polls for quite a long time in Israel&quot; on behalf of the Labor Party. It said that Israel could get $65 million-$70 million a year of the pipeline proceeds, and added, &quot;What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor.&quot;    As a legal case against Mr. Meese that is so laughable that we wonder if even Mr. McKay will file charges. Consider the obvious obstacles:   --There was no pipeline, no bribe and therefore no violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    --Only Americans are prohibited from paying bribes to foreigners under the act. Mr. Rappaport is a Swiss national, and clearly not covered by the U.S. law.    --There is no requirement that an attorney general seek indictments. Like all crimes in the U.S. Code, the anti-bribery law authorizes the attorney general to bring actions, but there is no legal obligation to do so. The most basic point about prosecutions is that there is discretion.    Certainly, indeed, one of the purposes of prosecutorial discretion is to avoid serious embarrassment to our foreign relations over trivial accusations. Mr. Peres, then prime minister of Israel and now foreign minister, wanted discretion not only for domestic reasons but for diplomatic ones. Iraq and Jordan would not care to admit they had sought Israeli assurances or had worked through a Swiss middleman. The U.S. wanted no public role in this project. Mr. Peres feared political problems if word got out about a pledge not to bomb. The secret of the planned pipeline is now divulged, causing embarrassment to several foreign heads of state.    What we have here is not an Ed Meese scandal but yet another special-prosecutor scandal. The bribe that was never paid for the Iraqi pipeline that was never built is the latest example of gotcha! prosecutorial politics against the Reagan administration. Mr. McKay had to come up with something to justify his investigation, so the usual standards of prosecutorial discretion and diplomatic prudence went out the window.    By now it has become a pattern. Whitney North Seymour tried to subpoena the Canadian ambassador to testify in the Michael Deaver trial despite the obvious barrier of diplomatic immunity. Lawrence Walsh's deputy told an appeals court that independent counsels answer to no one, including the secretary of state and the President, even on a sensitive foreign-policy matter.    Like the alien and sedition laws or some of the radical Reconstruction legislation, the Ethics in Government Act is not so much a law as a political weapon. This is clear enough simply from the fact that it applies only to members of the executive branch, not to the congressmen who enacted it or the judges who will decide its constitutionality. And as with earlier use of the law as a political weapon, real-life problems quickly emerge.    In his opinion invalidating these counsels, Judge Laurence Silberman pointed to the basic infirmity: &quot;The whole 'raison d'etre' of the independent counsel is not to administer the criminal law across a wide population, but rather to focus on one individual.&quot; We hope that when the Supreme Court takes up the appeal of Judge Silberman's opinion, it recognizes not only the general civil-liberty point but the danger of targeting officials who carry out the Republic's most sensitive business. It is no accident that the Founders gave both the power to prosecute and to make foreign policy to one branch, the executive. In the Shimon Peres case, for example, the issue is who decides if diplomatic correspondence stays private-independent counsels or the branch of government charged with maintaining allies? </TEXT></DOC>
