How banks respond to this difficult task will help shape the future of the debt crisis facing Latin American and other developing countries.    Since Mexico ran out of money in August 1982, banks have been leery of lending to heavily indebted developing countries and have generally taken back more money than they have lent to them. In the past year, large U.S. and British banks have together added more than $23 billion to their loss reserves against their loans to developing countries in response to deteriorating relations with Brazil and other major debtors.    And since Dec. 29, when Mexico, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and the U.S. Treasury announced a debt plan involving exchanging old bank debts for new bonds, there has been more talk of &quot;securitizing&quot; developing countries' bank debts -- which is likely to involve banks writing down such debts. Securitizing involves exchanging debt, often at below face value, for tradable instruments such as stocks and bonds.    This all makes it more difficult for banks to lend money to Brazil. But if the banks' already reduced lending falls further, many debtor countries could find it impossible to service their debts. &quot;If the large banks cut and run because of pressure from their shareholders and (brokerage) analysts, they won't get paid their interest,&quot; says Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, managing director of First Boston Corp.    Continued interruptions in interest payments would depress 1988 bank profits, which suffered considerably last year because of Brazil's refusal to pay interest on an estimated $67 billion of foreign bank debt. Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, said last week the most important issue facing his bank was getting Brazil to resume interest payments. Brazil this week started the lengthy process of ending its year-old moratorium on interest payments with a $350 million payment covering interest arrears for January, but still must work out a full debt settlement.    The U.S. government debt strategy, announced by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker in 1985, calls on commercial banks and the World Bank to continue lending to 15 heavily indebted developing countries in return for export-boosting economic reforms in those nations. The World Bank and other international development banks have increased their net lending to these countries in the past three years.    But commercial banks have generally worked to reduce their loans to these countries, which include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, other Latin American countries, the Philippines, Yugoslavia, Nigeria and Morocco. As of June, U.S. bank claims on these 15 countries totaled $84.8 billion, down 8% from $92.2 billion in December 1982. Factoring in inflation, the drop would be substantially greater.    Bankers argue that some of that reduction is accounted for by loan sales and write-offs, which have reduced total reported bank loans but haven't reduced the bank credit available to debtor countries. Moreover, analysts say, banks will lend to Brazil in view of its new debt stance.    &quot;The banks have been very patient with Brazil. They will change their attitude -- and will lend money to Brazil -- they have too much at stake not to,&quot; says Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.    Brazil's new finance minister, Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, this week said his country now is seeking an orthodox debt settlement after almost a year of quarreling with foreign creditors. The U.S. government is appreciative of Brazil's change of heart.    &quot;This new guy (Mr. Nobrega), he's got the right approach. He seems to have a little more stroke with (Brazilian President Jose) Sarney,&quot; says an administration official. &quot;The way things are down there politically, it's so tough that (Nobrega) could get cut off. But he's trying to normalize things.&quot;    Some are sceptical. First Boston's Mr. Kuczynski, a former Peruvian government minister and an expert on developing-country debt, says Brazil &quot;got spooked&quot; by creditors into changing its stance.    Spooked or not, Brazil's president and new finance minister decided the moratorium and bad relations with creditors weren't constructive. During the moratorium, its cost of trade finance rose, its reserves didn't grow much, investment dropped and Brazil didn't win concessions from its creditors, say Mr. Nobrega and other Brazilian officials.    The new Mexico-Morgan proposal may also have spurred Brazil to rethink its foreign debt policy. Brazil would like to try a similar plan to reduce its bank debt, but it needs strong reserves and creditor good will to carry out any such program.    Mindful of the need to raise new money for Brazil, the U.S. government and Morgan have played down the impact of the Mexican proposal on international debt strategy. They portray it as a way for dissatisfied bank lenders to exit the Mexican lending business.    The proposal has run into flak. A report by Salomon Brothers Inc. last week was sharply critical. &quot;At the moment it looks like it's getting a poor reception,&quot; said Mr. Kuczynski, though he praised the plan for breaking ground on securitization of developing-country debt.    But Mexico, particularly its director of public credit, Angel Gurria, Morgan and to a lesser extent the U.S. Treasury, have considerable prestige wrapped up in the new proposal.    Last-minute lobbying of banks by Mexico, Morgan or the U.S. government could boost the auction. The U.S. government denies any such intention. &quot;We're hands off on the Mexican deal, so on Feb. 19 you'll see a true participation,&quot; says one administration official.    Meanwhile, Latin America's third-largest debtor, Argentina, is struggling to cope with hundreds of millions of dollars of interest payments on its foreign bank debt, which it has either already missed or will shortly be unable to make.    Argentina's central bank governor, Jose Luis Machinea, is trying to patch together a revised economic program with the International Monetary Fund. If that is done, Argentina should get a total of $900 million in foreign loans from the IMF, commercial banks and Japan's export-import bank, which would allow it to cover interest payments at least until the end of March, according to a U.S. banker.    ---   Walter S.
