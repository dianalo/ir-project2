The association's chairman said its chief concerns would be the establishment of capital-adequacy standards and the proper &quot;conduct of business.&quot; The association is made up mostly of firms involved in the domestic and international debt and equity markets. It seeks government recognition as a self-regulatory organization responsible for the international securities markets, which include the Eurobond market.    The association said it hopes to be authorized by July and expects to gather 700 members by September. A law passed last year permits the Securities and Investments Board, a new watchdog for the financial-services industry, to set standards for certain government-recognized, self-regulatory groups. These organizations will cover every British-based investment market.    The Securities Association members want the group to act as a buffer between the legal requirements of the Financial Services Act and what they see as the freedoms essential to efficient international markets.    &quot;There is a delicate balance to be achieved between the requirements of the act and the requirements of the market,&quot; said Andrew Large, the association's chairman and managing director of Swiss Bank Corp. International Ltd. &quot;Too much red tape can drive business away to other financial centers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
