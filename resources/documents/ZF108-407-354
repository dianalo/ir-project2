(Chicago), andfull-fledged word-processing programs, such as Davka Corp.'s DavkaMultiWriter ($199).andM;In addition, many mainstream word-processing programs are taking onforeign-language capabilities.andP;  WordPerfect, for example, now supports morethan a dozen languages with special characters, built-in hyphenation rules,and spelling checkers.andP;  You can even instruct the program to check differentsections of text with different spelling checkers.andP;  In addition, WordPerfectCorp. (Orem, Utah) sells several foreign-language versions of the program.andO;Nota Bene ($495 from Dragonfly Software, New York), a popular word processorin academic circles, has an optional Special Language Supplement ($125) thatlets you mix right-to-left languages such as Hebrew with left-to-rightlanguages such as English.andM;As businesses become more international, the trend toward multilingualismwill get stronger, says Dalt Corp.'s Charles Ward.andP;  And many high-techbusinesses may soon find multilingualism more a necessity than a choice.andP;  &quot;Atone time, most technological advances came out of the United States,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;If there was any translation to be performed, it was performed inEurope and Japan by overseas businesses.&quot;andP;  But now a lot of new technologyoriginates in languages other than English, and chances are that our PCs canlearn Japanese, for example, faster than we can.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
