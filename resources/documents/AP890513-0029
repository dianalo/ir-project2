In Ashkelon, just north of the occupied Gaza Strip, hundreds ofIsraelis took to the streets last week, screaming ``Death to theArabs!'' and stoning Arab-owned cars.   In nearby Ashdod, residents beat an Israeli shopkeeper whoemploys Arabs and fractured the skull of a Palestinian motoristwith a rock as he was waiting at a traffic light.   ``The Arabs should be locked inside the Gaza Strip so they candestroy each other. The time has come to punish them severely,''said Ruth, a 23-year-old Ashkelon secretary and neighbor of themissing soldier, Ilan Saadon. She would not give her last name.   Outbreaks of anti-Arab emotion often follow Palestinian attackson Israelis. But the anger in recent days has escalated beyond thenorm, apparently compounded by rising frustration over Israel'sinability to stop the 17-month Palestinian uprising.   Hardline politicians, sensing the grumbling across the country,have stepped up their rhetoric and called for tougher measures toquell the rebellion against Israeli rule.   Speaking after the fatal stabbing of two elderly Israelis inJerusalem on May 3, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called on theIsraeli public to deal with terrorists.   ``If the murderers succeed, they should not be allowed to escapein one piece,'' said Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc.   His aides later denied he was urging vigilante justice.   Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of Likud demanded the governmentseal off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for three months,starting in July, to crush the uprising.   The proposal, expected to be discussed soon by the Cabinet,would bar Palestinians from entering Israel and journalists fromcovering the occupied lands.   ``Their (the Palestinians) free movement in sovereign Israel hasbecome dangerous,'' Katsav said.   During a three-month closure, he said, efforts would be made toreplace the 110,000 Palestinians from the occupied lands who nowwork in Israel, most in menial jobs such as construction,agriculture and santitation.   Palestinian employment is already down.   According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Palestinians putin about 25 percent fewer working hours each week than before theuprising in 1987.   The drop is attributed both to army-imposed curfews in theoccupied areas and to Palestinian general strikes called to protestIsraeli occupation.   In Ashdod, a Mediterranean city of 80,000 and hometown of slainsoldier Avi Sassportaz, officials are focusing their anger on Arabemployment, trying to phase out most of the 1,250 Arab workers.   High school students, for example, were mobilized to cleanstreets during the Independence Day holiday when the Gaza Strip wasunder curfew.   Mayor Zvi Zilker of Likud wants to raise manual labor wages by25 percent to make the jobs more attractive to Israelis and hassuggested offering army veterans a one-year university scholarshipin exchange for one year of manual labor. The city council willvote on the ideas Sunday.   The proposals were sparked by the May 7 discovery of Sassportaz'body in a grave 15 miles south of Ashdod. Authorities saidSassportaz was shot to death by Palestinians who gave a ride to thehitchhiking soldier Feb. 16.   The discovery unleashed several days of anti-Arab rioting in thecity, and city officials decided to escort Arab workers to the GazaStrip to prevent them from being attacked.   During a visit to Ashkelon on Friday, anti-Arab sentiments stillran high in Saadon's Shimson neighborhood, a run-down housingproject populated mostly by immigrants from Morocco and the SovietUnion.   ``The Arabs are walking around freely, and nobody is stoppingthem. They should not be allowed to enter Israel,'' said PinchasElka, 18, a neighbor and former classmate of Saadon, who was lastseen May 3 hitchhiking in southern Israel.   Ruth said that since Saadon's disappearance, she has wanted toavoid all contacts with Arabs. ``At work, we have Arabs who clean.I can't look them in the eye. I hate them. They pretend they areinnocent. But they hate us, too,'' she said.   Ashkelon Mayor Eli Dayan of the left-leaning Labor Partydownplayed the anti-Arab outbursts, saying they were incited by afew extremists.   However, he said in an interview that if attacks on Israeliscontinue, authorities might no longer be able to contain the angerin the city of 60,000.</TEXT></DOC>
