There are limited spaces available formembers of the public to attend either as participants or observers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Cooper Rees, U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, (TS-796), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC, 20460, Tel.(202) 382-3505 (FTS: 382-3505), for information about the workshop itselfand for application as a participant or an observer. Space is limited.Apply by March 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Several agents have been identifiedas developmental neurotoxicants in humans: ethanol, methylmercury, PCBs,lead, x-irradiation, diphenylhydantoin, and several substances of abuse.These agents have been evaluated in a number of animal studies and qualitativecomparisons between the human and animal data have been made for some.In the past, several symposia have been held where data have been presentedon these chemicals, but there has been no rigorous review of the data,especially a comparison of effects based on dose. This information wouldbe extremely valuable for building an information base for the purposesof risk assessment (e.g., reducing uncertainties regarding interpretationof results) and for use in establishing criteria for selecting agents.An Agency-wide workgroup is developing test guidelines in this area.The outline of the program includes: (1) On April 11, a full day of presentationsby experts summarizing human and animal data on given chemicals or classesof chemicals; (2) on April 12, a full day of small work group discussionsto address specific issues (Qualitative Comparisons: Neurobiology, StudyDesign, Quantitative Comparisons, and Triggers for Testing) and preparea report; and (3) on April 13, a half-day of summarizing the reports ofthe workgroups' conclusions. Participants will include speakers and attendeeswho are being invited because of their specific expertise and a limitednumber of additional members of the public who express an interest in attending.The proceedings and results of this workshop will be submitted for publication.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Erich Bretthauer,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-5334 Filed 3-7-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
