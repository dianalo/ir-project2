But Steven P. Benifiel, who law enforcement agenciesallege ran a big drug operation out of Steve's Garage, mayhave profited from being based in this town of 3,000.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;When the police drove into town,&quot; grouses state narcoticsagent Don Bush, &quot;even in an unmarked car, it took {thealleged drug dealers} about five minutes to learn you werethere.&quot;   Mr. Benifiel's notoriety became not only an open secret inRanger, but also something of a joke. After a failedinvestigation several years ago, an anonymous advertisementin the local Ranger Times commiserated with the countysheriff and two state agencies. &quot;Better luck next time,&quot; thead read, and it was signed &quot;The Ranger Bandit.&quot;   While Mr. Benifiel isn't saying much about the ad, RangerPolice Chief Vernon Gaughron says, &quot;Everyone knew it washim.&quot; Police say Mr. Benifiel, who kept a Bengal tiger as apet, once signed a speeding ticket as the Ranger Bandit. &quot;Itwasn't taken too kindly by the law enforcement agencies,&quot;says Chief Gaughron. &quot;He is in a world of trouble now.&quot;   Mr. Benifiel and 10 alleged associates were arrested lastweek on drug possession and conspiracy charges after aninvestigation by the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FederalBureau of Investigation, the Texas Rangers, the stateDepartment of Public Safety and other agencies too numerousto mention. Informants guided the lawmen, but the snare was atelephone cord. &quot;It took a wiretap to do it,&quot; says Lt. Bush.   Conspicuously absent in the dragnet were the local lawmenfrom the Eastland County Sheriff's Department and the RangerPolice Department. Sheriff Dee O. Hogan was arrested forobstruction of justice in the Benifiel case. As for thepolice, says Chief Gaughron, &quot;The FBI left us out to save usfrom any repercussions.&quot;   Mr. Benifiel, who is being held without bond, hasn'tentered a plea to the charges against him, his attorney says.Sheriff Hogan will plead innocent, according to his lawyer.   But today, it's other lawmen who are confident. A statetrooper took out an ad of his own in the Ranger Times severaldays after the arrests. &quot;What goes around comes around,&quot; itread. &quot;Bye, bye Bandit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
