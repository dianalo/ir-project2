Bush hinted Friday he may be willing to take some steps beyondthe newly announced federal ban on imports of five popular types ofsemiautomatic weapons. Law enforcement officials are pressing for aprohibition covering weapons made in America as well.   ``The police have been very concerned about this and we've got tofind an accommodation between the police and the sportinginterest,'' the president said.   ``In my view there can be an accommodation, there must be anaccommodation,'' said Bush, a lifetime member of the National RifleAssociation and outspoken foe of gun control.   Asked if the new ban on imports represented a change in positionon gun control, Bush said, ``It represents certainly a heightenedconcern on my part about AK-47s. It's a pulse change,'' he added,grabbing his wrist.   The debate over assault weapons has ``gotten pretty hot,'' hesaid, ``but we'll make our decisions from the administration in acool _ you know, a cool way, based on facts and not swayed one wayor another by the temper of the debate.   ``But I can understand when kids are shot down by an automatedweapon _ semiautomated weapon or automated, whichever it was _ why,I can certainly understand the public outcry.'' Five children werekilled and more than two dozen others were wounded earlier this yearin Stockton, Calif., by a deranged gunman with a semiautomatic AK-47.   The president discussed guns and other issues in a 30-minute chatwith reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from anovernight speechmaking trip to Houston and Colorado Springs, Colo.   Instead of their customary weekend at Camp David, Bush and hiswife Barbara were remaining at the White House because theirspringer spaniel, Millie, was giving birth to puppies.   ``It's changed my life, seriously,'' Bush said in mock horror.``You think I'm kidding about that? It's awful.''   The dog gave birth to six puppies over a five-hour period endingat about 2 a.m. this morning, said White House spokeswoman AnnaPerez.   Bush explained that the first lady had banished him from theirroom to the Lincoln Bedroom because of Millie, who sleeps on theirbed.   Bush said his wife explained that ``Millie had a very bad nightlast night, thrashing around and you would be irritable.'' He added,``So I'm being sent down the hall, which just suits the heck out ofme.''   On other subjects, Bush said:   _No decision has been made on a proposed joint venture with theJapanese for production in Japan of a new version of the F-16 jetfighter. He sought to play down earlier suggestions that a basiccommitment had been made to the project, with only details remainingto be worked out.   _He was saddened that hostage Terry Anderson, Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, was beginning his fifth yearof captivity in Lebanon, but said that wouldn't lead to any changeor reformulation in U.S. policy on hostages. The fact that Andersonand other remain held against their will ``is with me every singlewaking hour.''   _He was concerned about the 1 percent increase in wholesaleprices in February reported Friday, claiming ``you always have to bevigilant'' against inflation. He said the best way to fightinflation was to reach agreement with Congress on reducing thebudget deficit.   _Gave a thumbs-up sign on word that Rep. Richard Cheney had won92-0 Senate confirmation as defense secretary. A Tuesday swearing-inis planned, but Bush said ``he'll go to work right away'' at thePentagon.   _Signed a proclamation designating May 4 as a National Day ofPrayer. It has been an annual event since 1952.</TEXT></DOC>
