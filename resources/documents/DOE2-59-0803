Increasing theratio of I:U male to 5, 10, 15 and 20 increased the percentage of infertileeggs to 85.7, 92.0, 95.4 and 97.7, respectively. Thus, males treatedwith a sterilizing dose (60 krad) were fully competitive with U males,especially at the two highest 'flooding' ratios. Males and females treatedwith a sterilizing dose (60 krad) and confined with U males and U femalesin a ratio of I male:I female:U male:U female caused 60.9% infertilityin the resulting eggs. When the ratio of sterile males and females wasincreased to 5:5:1:1, 10:10:1:1, 15:15:1:1 or 20:20:1:1 (I male:I female:Umale:U female), the percentage of infertility reached 83.5, 97.3, 99.1and 100.0, respectively. The percentage of actual infertility was lessthan the expected infertility for the ratios 1:1:1:1, 5:5:1:1, 10:10:1:1and 15:15:1:1, but it was exceeded by the highest ratio used (20:20:1:1).The competitiveness value for this flooding ratio was 1.00 (i.e. thesterile adults were fully competitive with the normal ones). The resultsindicated that irradiation at 60 krad, a sterilizing dose, did not decreasethe sexual competitiveness of adults. Also, the release of I males only,or of I females together with I males, could give good results in controllingthe almond moth population in an autocidal control programme and, therefore,separation of the sexes prior to release is probably unnecessary.
