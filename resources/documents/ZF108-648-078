Conrads on what the1990s hold in store for us.andP;  On the morning we sat down to interview Conrads,the mergers an6 acquisition chief for First Boston Corp. thought he had justcompleted the industry's first big deal of the new decade.andP;  (It unraveledweeks later.)andM;&quot;Have you heard about the Lotus-Novell merger?&quot; Conrads asked us shortlyafter we arrived at First Boston's Park Avenue headquarters in New York City.andO;Thinking that the Mandamp;A chief wanted to start the interview off on the lighterside, we immediately asked him for the punch line.andP;  &quot;It's no joke,&quot; he saidof the proposed marriage between Lotus Development Corp. and Novell Inc. Andhe went on to elaborate about why such a union of financial equals makessense.andP;  It was a serious start to a very serious conversation with Conradsabout the future of the industry-a 90-minute dialogue, excerpts from whichyou see here.andM;Our conversation covered a range of companies, including U.S.andP;  suppliersATandamp;T, Compaq Computer Corp., Computer Associates International Inc., CrayResearch Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., General Dynamics Corp.,andO;Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., Lotus, McDonnell Douglas Corp., MicrosoftCorp., Motorola Inc., NCR Corp., Novell, Poqet Computer Corp. and Supertech;European suppliers Cap Gemini Sogeti, Groupe Bull, Hoskyns Group Ltd., Ing C.andO;Olivetti andamp; Co. SpA, NV Philips' GL, Sema Group, Siemens AG and Sligos; andJapanese suppliers Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp., Okigawa Electric and Sony Corp.andM;Conrads' vision if information technology is one shaped by knowledge andexperience.andP;  He spent his undergraduate and early graduate years as a YellowJacket,  earning bachelor's and master's degrees in atomic physics from theGeorgia institute of Technology.andP;  He picked up a master's degree in businessadministration at Harvard University before joining McKinsey andamp; Co., amanagement consulting firm whose electronics practice he headed.andP;  FromMcKinsey, he joined Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. He then switched investment banks,choosing to ply his Mandamp;A trade at First Boston.andM;Q: The most frequently mentioned subject in the magazine's conversations withusers and suppliers is talk of a major change under way in the informationtechnology industry-away from computing on hosts toward doing so in aclient/server environment.andP;  Do you see such a change? If so, what impact willit have on the world's top 100 suppliers?andM;A: What's going on is very similar to the change that we had when we wentfrom mainframes to minicomputers.andP;  If you go back to the late 1960s, it wasthought that the only real computing that could be done was at the mainframelevel.andP;  Digital and some others destroyed that notion.andP;  As technology enabledmore robust implementation of applications on smaller boxes, all of a suddenapplications that no one had ever dreamed of were running on computers in themid- to late-1970s.andM;The same thing is already happening in microcomputers.andP;  And it will continueto evolve to the point where a mainframe acts as a server, a traffic cop, anumber cruncher.andP;  The real computing-particularly the application interface,which is becoming more complex-will occur at the local level.andM;The local environment is not just a microcomputer.andP;  It's a network where youcan move a lot of intelligence [information] around at any given instant.andM;Q: The single biggest trend evident in this and previous years' DATAMATION100 data is that demand for information technology (IT) is growing much morerapidly in Europe and the Pacific Rim than in the United States.andP;  What areyour thoughts on the subject?andM;A: The base of information systems installed in the United States is a lotlarger.andP;  When you look at absolute dollar increases in the amount users arespending on computers, the U.S.andP;  market is still quite substantial.andP;  Also,recognize that the United States is always three to five years ahead of Japan and Europe.andM;The real growth curve in computer spending that we saw in the United Statesin the early 1980s is just.andP;  now hitting Europe and Japan.andP;  They're investingin technology that allows them to do a lot of things that they hadn't beenable to do in the past.andM;Q: Do you expect that the indigenous suppliers in the Pacific Rim and Europewill capture most of the information technology growth in those regions, ordo you see U.S.andP;  companies getting their fair share?andM;A: I think that U.S.andP;  suppliers are going to get their fair share.andP;  But inJapan, in particular, I think we're going to see local suppliers inpartnership with U.S.andP;  companies-not to just extract technology, but to buildthe distribution infrastructure needed to do business in Japan and the restof Asia.andM;Q: Can you give an example of something happening in Japan right now thatevidences that change?andM;A: Cray Research's purchase of Supertech.andP;  Supertech has a relationship withOkigawa Electric, whereby it serves as the Japanese distributor for itssupercomputing products.andP;  That's the kind of thing you'll see in the future.andO;And a lot of U.S.andP;  companies-particularly software producers-that haven'tbeen in the Asian market are looking for ways to penetrate it.andP;  Knowing thatapplications are so important, they realize they must have local talent andlocal knowledge [to be successful there].andM;Q: Who will win the battle for the information technology budgets of Europeanusers?andM;A: Europe is a horse of a different color because U.S.andP;  suppliers are muchmore comfortable there.andP;  They've been there longer.andP;  They've made a lot ofinroads in that market.... That isn't going to change.andP;  I think that you'regoing to see Japanese companies working through local European entities togain more of a share of the market.andP;  But it's going to be a slow, hard roadfor Japanese suppliers-really hard.andM;Q: So you see much stiffer competition for Europe's premier suppliers?andM;A:  Absolutely.... Companies  like Siemens and Olivetti are going to have todevelop much better channels of distribution for information technology asthe 1992 phenomenon really picks up momentum.andP;  They are going to have toestablish themselves in a much broader context in Europe than just withintheir national borders.andM;Q: How much momentum does Western Europe really have?andM;A: It's going to be a very high growth market.andP;  But the 1992 phenomenon isnot going to be a light switch that comes on.andP;  It's occurring now and willbuild momentum through 1996, 1997, 1998 or whenever.andP;  By the late 1990s, theeconomics of Europe are going to be fairly transparent through the majorcountries.andP;  And the big players will be present in most markets by the end ofthe decade.andM;Q: One thing European and Japanese suppliers seem to have going for them incompeting against U.S.andP;  companies are regional or national industrialpolicies.andP;  Are U.S.andP;  suppliers at a disadvantage?andM;A: On any given Monday morning, yes, they can be.andP;  Are U.S.andP;  suppliers in allcases? Not necessarily, because sometimes the policy is so vague that itallows a supplier enough room to maneuver to be competitive.andP;  In some cases,that brings the best competitive actions out of the company in the UnitedStates or its subsidiaries around the world....andM;U.S.andP;  policy, for all intents and purposes, is: Anything that can succeed isin.andP;  The fact of the matter is that the Europeans and the Asians can't asreadily supply software, which is driven by application knowledge, ascompanies in the United States can.andP;  So that's where U.S.andP;  suppliers aresuccessful.andP;  They also are enjoying success on the hardware side.andP;  Let's notforget that IBM, a U.S.andP;  company, still dominates computers.andM;Q: Returning to the issue of how much faster IT spending is growing outsidethe United States than within it, are U.S.andP;  users placed at a disadvantage bythe fact that their European and Asian rivals in the last few years haveconsumed much more leading-edge products than those available in the UnitedStates in the early 1980s?andM;A: U.S.andP;  users are much smarter about applications because they got involvedwith applying information technology to their businesses much earlier on....andO;And to a large degree--with open systems and standards coming in now, andwith a lot of applications software being ported into these new openenvironments--U.S.andP;  users will be able  to keep up on a price-performancebasis with the Europeans or the Japanese.andM;Q: Since you brought up the subject, how much of a factor will open systemsbe in the 1990s? And why should users care about them at all?andM;A: Open systems are happening.andP;  Suppliers are paying attention to UNIX.andP;  Theyare porting to UNIX.andP;  They are developing applications on UNIX.andP;  And UNIX isgoing to be a real force.andP;  But the concept of customer control is stillextremely important, and what IBM and Digital and others are doing isfiguring out other ways where they  can add value to differentiate their openproducts-keeping them in effect proprietary suppliers to their customers....andM;Standard interfaces give the customers more confidence to take greater risks,including bringing in new IT suppliers.andP;  That means that the dominant playersare going to have to do more than just sell the users one time.andP;  They'regoing to have to continue to sell and support them, trying to add value allthe while.andP;  That's going to accelerate the number of applications that we seeout in the [end-user] environment.andM;Q: Switching back again to competition, suppliers often liken their market toa playing field.andP;  Is it a level or uneven one?andM;A: There are major imbalances.andP;  And the reason that there are majorimbalances is that more and more of this business is becoming applicationsdriven.andP;  If, for example, you have a software package that works great inpharmacies in Canada, it doesn't necessarily work great in pharmacies in theUnited States-.andP;  The application knowledge is so crucial in that indigenousmarket that local companies whether owned internationally or locally-aregoing to have an advantage because they can relate to the customers.andP;  Theycan embody the applications for those customers in a product or system thatthe customers can use.andM;Q: Applications seem to be a new element of competition.andP;  Years ago, wouldn'tyou have measured competitiveness in terms of which regions of the world hadthe best technology infra.andP;  structure, interest rates, etc.?andM;A: I don't want to de-emphasize the upstream technologies and their effectlong term.andP;  As time goes on, you are going to see more and more of thesoftware and application knowledge embedded in silicon [the base material forsemiconductors, the brains of most computers].andP;  As a supplier, if you don'thave the silicon or access to it, you are going to be at a real disadvantagebecause miniaturization is one of the big drivers of new applications ofinformation technology.andP;  Suppliers must keep reducing the footprint [physicalsize] of their  systems and devices within them.andP;  And the way they can dothat is by getting more of their software embedded in the silicon.andM;Q: Where do U.S., European and Japanese suppliers stand in regard to siliconand other competitive areas?andM;A: In terms of just raw output of silicon, we all know the answer tothat-it's all in Japan.andP;  In terms of the knowledge incorporated in thatsilicon, it resides in the United States and Europe-particularly in theUnited Kingdom, where there are extremely good software development tools.andM;The breakthrough in software development is going to be akin to thebreakthrough of going from a transistor  to an integrated circuit...Once weget a robust set of CASE [computer-aided software engineering] tools, asoftware developer won't have to write a million lines of code for anapplication.andP;  With the right CASE tools, all a developer would have to do iscome up with 100 concepts, which a cogenerator can then turn into the millionlines of code.andP;  They, in turn, can be translated into silicon, which is goingto take a hundredth of the space that it takes up today.andP;  And that is what weare looking at in the decade of the 1990s.andP;  I think it's going to be thatdramatic.andM;Q: When are we going to see this drama unfold?andM;A: There are going to b? some major breakthroughs in software between 1993and 1995-maybe sooner....andM;The software and silicon developments also have implications for ourcommunications systems because the way you are going to make applicationsmore robust is by feeding them with more information.andP;  You have to be able toincrease your bandwidth to feed information into the system, to process itand then move it back out so it can be useful.andP;  That, in turn, hasimplications on what our telecommunications networks are....andM;All these things are going to make their impact, in the course  ;f themid1990S ...andP;  when we still see applications that we can hardly even imaginetoday-multimedia applications, large international data transfers, etc.andM;Q: What role will niche players have in the world of integrated  applicationsthat you describe? Are major systems companies like NCR, Hewlett-Packard andothers going to ride roughshod over suppliers focused on single markets?andM;A: I think it's still way too early to tell.andP;  Compag, for example, has founda very successful niche for itself in upgrading the capabilities of analystsand secretaries by bringing computing power to the desktop in a way thatworks the user.andP;  The customer will continue to buy Compaq if, for example, itcontinues to solve problems.andM;Q: Are you saying that users of information-technology will continue tosupport the small  layers as well as the big ones?andM;A: Yes.andP;  And even Compaq.andP;  is even moving toward a systems [as opposed tosingle-user] approach.andP;  it would argue, I think, that it's moving at the pacethat users are moving.andP;  As users' applications requirements go up, Compaq ismore in sync with them than some other suppliers that are trying toforce-feed users withandM;Q: is it easier for small suppliers to move upstream technologically asusers' applications needs grow than it is for big-iron companies to movedownstream?andM;A: The supplier who is going to win is the one that pays attention to thecustomer-figuring out where it can add value to [customers'] applications.andO;That can be a systems guy or a box guy.andP;  But a supplier can't just have salesand marketing driving the technology, because you will never get there fromhere.andP;  A supplier must have an integrated approach to solving users' problemswhere the technologists get involved and they,  in some cases, force-feed alittle bit of technology to users.andM;Q: The leading company in the industry, IBM, often boasts of being in thesolutions business.andP;  How do you think IBM will perform in the next few years?andM;A: IBM is taking a lot of heat ...andP;  and has been for the last couple ofyears.andP;  It is, by all measures, still a dominant company in the industry-notjust domestically but also in Europe and even in Japan.andP;  it is a company thathas an extraordinary customer base.andP;  And it is one that is struggling withhow to deal with the evolution of the market.... IBM will continue to liveand do well.andP;  But it's going to go in some different directions ...andP;  It willcontinue to reexamine what it is and where it is going.andP;  But it's going tocontinue to be a very viable competitor.andM;Q: Other than IBM, what information-technology suppliers stand out in yourmind as being positioned to make a major contribution to the is strategies ofusers in the 1990s?andM;A: Thinking about this question from silicon up through systems andcommunications, I'd begin with Intel.andP;  On the semiconductor side, it's goingto be a powerhouse-maybe along with Motorola.andP;  But if I had to choose one orthe other, I would tend to go with Intel.andP;  It's going to drive the processingcapability that will enable users to run new, critical applications.andM;Moving into systems, I think companies like Sun are very adaptable-eventhough it had a bit  of a downer in its growth.andP;  Sun is going to be veryimportant on the engineering side and in the whole workstation field....andM;I also like Sony in that regard, because I think it is looking for a way intothis whole market.andP;  These guys [who run Sony] are awfully smart.... They havethe resources to join the [information technology] party-not only at thesilicon level, but also at the product level.andM;Q: Do you think a company with a consumer orientation such as Sony will be ina better position to deliver the sorts of easy-to-use computer interfacesdemanded by information-technology customers in the 1990s than industriallyfocused suppliers?andM;A: Yes.andP;  Sony also understands miniaturization and  its  effects  oninterfaces .... Sony is looking at the world from a  different angle than IBMor ATandamp;T ....andM;The Hewlett-Packard/Apollo combination also is very powerful.andP;  it's muchsmarter about bringing technology to market [than it used to be]...andP;  It hasthe resources to be a player.andM;Q: Are you speaking of financial or human resources? A: Both.andP;  You know,you've got to have both to be a player in this market.andP;  You have to have theresources to be able to talk to the customer and service his needs on aregular basis so he knows that you're paying attention to him.andP;  That'ssomething that a lot of these world-class players like HP have.andM;Q: Who catches your eye in software and in bigger systems? A: Microsoft isgoing to continue to be a force in this market.... So could ComputerAssociates.andM;On the large systems side, companies like NEC, ATandamp;T, IBM-while some view themas giants that kind of slowly move along-have the staying power.andP;  They havethe customer base, and they understand the importance of bringing thetechnology into the customer's business.andM;Q: Do any small supplier companies capture your attention?andM;A: My characterization of who's going to be around and who's going to beimportant tends to focus on larger companies.andP;  But that's not to say thatthere aren't going to be start-ups with whiz-bang products that emerge fromplaces like Silicon Valley.andM;But as DATAMATION's readers make systems-oriented decisions and the impactthey have on their organization's strategies, there are some suppliers whosedirections they had better understand.andP;  Those are the players I'm describing.andM;Q: There's no European supplier on your list of companies likely to play amajor role in the 1990s.andP;  Why?andM;A: Three that can be forces worldwide are Siemens, Philips and Cap Gemini.andM;Q: How about Olivetti and Bull?andM;A: Olivetti has got a transition to get through.andP;  It has a good businessstrategy, and I think its execution is pretty good.andP;  [It's just a question ofwhether Olivetti has the resources to accomplish everything.]andM;Groupe Bull is being subsidized by the French government.andP;  And whenever youhave that kind of a situation, as a user you wonder when some governmentadministration might change its mind [about staying in the informationtechnology business ].... Right now, Bull is a force in the market.andP;  Q: Whatare going to be the characteristics of the chief executive officer capable ofleading an information technology supplier through the 1990s?andM;IBM AND DIGITAL WILL FIGURE OUT WAYS To DIFFERENTIATE THEIR OPEN PRODUCTS.andM;A: It's got to be somebody who is capable of taking risks, of pulling teamstogether and, yet, be hard-nosed about the decisions that have to be made asthe company goes through various stages and as the environment changes aroundit.andM;In information technology, bear in mind, there are more variables changing ata faster rate than in any other industry.andP;  Technology is changing.andP;  Customerneeds are changing..Capital availability is changing.andP;  Competition ischanging--competitors can come out of the woodwork to challenge a CEO.andP;  Andchannels of distribution are changing...andM;Such variables require a senior management team to be able to make decisions,try a variety of new things, do more of what works and do less of whatdoesn't work.andP;  Moreover, the team must make those decisions fairlyquickly.... and have the resources available so that it can afford to make amistake or two.andP;  If you're operating on a very thin balance sheet, you justdon't have the resources available to make a mistake.andM;Q: What are chief executive officers of information technology supplierstelling you about their strategies for the 1990s?andM;A: A lot of CEOs are concerned about survival today.andP;  They don't know exactlyhow to position their companies to survive this discontinuity.andP;  The abilityto capture the technology in a product and manufacture and market it on aneconomic scale throughout the world is becoming much more awesome....andM;The thing that is on everybody's mind is consolidation.andM;Q: What will be the major trends in mergers and acquisitions for informationtechnology suppliers in the 1990s?andM;A: Suppliers that merge will compliment each other either in theirdistribution channels, products, technologies or geographies.andP;  They will cometogether on a truly equal basis to create much broader-based competitors thanpreviously existed.andM;Q: Are we likely to see mergers between companies from different regions ofthe world or within them?andM;A: We're going to see both types.andP;  One thing becoming more prevalent is thisnotion of IBM or Japanese suppliers taking equity positions in a company asopposed to buying the whole company.andP;  The reason is not just economic.andP;  It'sto preserve the culture ...andP;  of that company.andP;  You're going to see more of itbecause if you have equity participation between two suppliers, you have atrue strategic partnership.andM;Q: Does intermediate integration-as some people describe these equityarrangements-make more sense for major players like IBM and Hitachi andSiemens than it does for smaller companies?andM;A: It makes sense for all size companies for different reasons.andP;  You can godown to the real small companies like Poqet Computer, for example, which gota big infusion from Fujitsu-30% or 40% of the equity.... Or you can look atbig companies like IBM.andP;  ibm's investments give it access to new technologyand channels that it didn't have before.andP;  And equity positions leave IBM'soptions open, giving it time to figure out how to shape its business overtime.andM;Q: Are you bold enough to say that, if we think we've seen consolidating inthe past, we ain't seen nothing yet?andM;A: Yeah.andP;  I'm bold enough to say that--particularly in  the  middlemarket.... You're going to see much more of a bimodal distribution ofcompanies in the United States five or six years from now in informationtechnology....andM;I think you're going to have it in Europe as well, because economies of scaleare necessary to take advantage of opportunities created by 19 events inEastern Europe.andP;  Q: Can users judge these companies by just some of thefinancial numbers? When we look at companies, should we look for higherresearch and development as a percentage of sales? Or are these numbersreally not valid as a judging point?andM;THE BREAKTHROUGH IN SOFTWARE WILL BE AKIN To GoiNG FRom A TRANSISTOR To ANIC.andM;A: Not entirely.andP;  The percentage of sales devoted to research anddevelopment, for example, is relative to how big a-supplier's sales are andhow many things it is spreading research investments across.andP;  A medium-sizedcompany spreading its Randamp;D dollars across too many things is much worse offthan a small one focused on the product area customers are most interestedin.andM;These percentages are flags.andP;  If a supplier is spending 1% or 2% on Randamp;D andone of its sales representatives is telling you, the user, what a great newproduct set is coming down the road, you should be pretty skeptical.andP;  On theother hand, if a supplier is spending 10% on Randamp;D, you had better understandexactly where that's being spent.andP;  It may be taking off in a direction that'snot important to the user at all.andM;Or if a supplier's revenue per employee is way up, you should ask whether thecompany is squeezing back on its infrastructure costs so much that it may beunable to support customers in the future....andM;Pay attention to return on capital investment, which answers the question:How good is a supplier at getting the capital needed for a job and beingsuccessful at employing that capital? If a supplier is consistently good atthat, it's a winner.andP;  That's what causes some suppliers-like HP, Intel andothers-to stand out.andP;  Intel, which is in a business that uses up cash, isgood at maintaining profit margins on its new products and playing out itsold products to generate the cash needed to invest in the Randamp;D and new capitalequipment needed to stay more than competitive.andM;Q: Looking  beyond the 1989 financial performance of  the industry's top 100companies, do you see the industry growing year to year throughout the 1990s?andM;A: There is going to be growth.andP;  It's not going to be as explosive as it wasjust because the  base  today  is  bigger.... Worldwide, year-to-year growthwill be 7 to 8% for the next five years.... There's still a lot of juice lefthere, in my view.andP;  We're not even approaching the limits of the coretechnologies that  drive this industry-silicon, software and communications.andM;I can't emphasize enough what impact new networks are going to have on theindustry.andP;  The supplier that can provide local area networks to a user andhelp the user with applying those LANS is going to be in a preferredposition.andP;  That supplier is going to be channeling software.andP;  The supplier isgoing to probably be developing front-end [hardware or software] to match theuser s applications....andM;Being able to move large volumes of information at high speeds and computewith such information in real time is going to just leapfrog theapplications.andP;  Practically speaking, right now we cannot do high-volume,real-time processing because we don't have the bandwidth to do so.andP;  But weain't far away.andM;Is Outsourcing Here to Stay?andM;Outsourcing is a topic being given increasing attention by top informationsystems executives worldwide.andP;  They want to know whether they should considerfarming out critical is functions to service providers.andP;  Here are Conrads'thoughts on the subject.andM;Q: Is outsourcing here to stay?andM;A: It's going to be slow to start but accelerate once several large companiesdo it successfully.andP;  You're going to find CEOs asking their Is directors:&quot;Why can't we do it?&quot;andM;Q: Is outsourcing a good business for an IBM or a Digital to be in?andM;A: Given Digital's Culture and their mentality, it is going to be a big leapto get into that business--on its own ...andP;  because outsourcing really is adifferent way of thinking about your business.andP;  Outsourcing is a differentway of serving your customer, a different way of helping your customer thinkabout its business.andP;  That's what makes some of these outsourcing suppliers sosuccessful-they won't touch hardware unless it's part of the services theyoffer, and most don't  really want to sell packaged software.andM;Q.andP;  Are you seeing an outsourcing in Europe or Japan?andM;A: In Europe, Hoskyns, Cap Gemini,  Sligos and Sema are all in a position ofbeing able to do so.andP;  But outsourcing isn't as well accepted in Europe as itis in the United States, though Cap Gemini has done a very good job in somecases with this.andM;Q: What should is directors do about outsourcing?andP;  Should they embrace it asa solution to their problem? Should they try to spin out their own isoperations to form outsourcing units?andM;A: If you are going to create your own outsourcing business within yourenterprise, it has to be an explicit strategic move that is endorsed by parent company.... That's a though decision.andP;  A lot of companies likeMcDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics-ones that built large data centers inthe '60s and '70s to support large projects--looked at entering what today wecall the outsourcing business pretty hard.andP;  In most cases, they decided notto do so.andP;  Those that did ...andP;  haven't really kept up with the times.andM;Suppliers That Will Make a DifferenceandM;European, Japanese and U.S.andP;  companies that are poised to make a contributionto the industry in the 1990sandM;COMPANYandM;European SuppliersandM;Cap GeminiandM;Groupe BullandM;STRENGTHS andamp; CHALLENGESandM;Well positioned to deliver application solutions Currently a force, butgovernment subsidization is questionableandM;COMPANYandM;OlivettiandM;SiemensandM;STRENGTHS andamp; CHALLENGESandM;Good strategy and execution, but enough resources?
