(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trespass trial of 155 anti-abortionactivists opened under the glare of floodlights Monday, withpotential jurors and defendants sitting in a theater because nocourtroom could hold all of them.   Hillsborough County Judge James D. Arnold consolidated the casesand rented the 300-seat Jaeb Theater at the Tampa Performing ArtsComplex for what is expected to be a weeklong trial.   Arnold sat center stage at a makeshift judge's bench, while the95 prospective jurors occupied the first five rows. The defendantstook up the orchestra, mezzanine and balcony seats of the theaterdesigned as an intimate hall for nightclub acts and jazz ensembles.   Prosecutors say the defendants broke the law April 15 when theytried to disrupt operations at the Women's Health Center. About1,200 people organized by Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group,demonstrated at the clinic.   More than 180 were arrested and charged with trespass afterwarning, a misdemeanor that carries a possibile maximum sentence ofone year in prison and a $1,000 fine. Some pleaded no contest in adeal with prosecutors and received six months' probation; the restopted for trial.   Jury candidates were bused to the arts complex. Attorneysexpected to take all day to seat a six-member jury.   Outside, four demonstrators representing both sides of the issuepicketed peacefully.   The judge ruled earlier that the defendants wouldn't be allowedto argue that any trespass was justified and excusable because theywere saving lives.   Defense attorney Gregory Boyer had hoped to present what he saidwas evidence that many women arriving at the center on April 15were scheduled to have abortions, and that most women, deterredonce, are less likely to follow through with a second appointment.He said the defense has been used in jury trials in similar caseselsewhere.   But Arnold agreed with prosecutors that because abortion islegal in Florida and a first-trimester fetus is not considered aviable baby, the defense is irrevelant and would become anemotional plea to jurors.</TEXT></DOC>
