The mishap occurred when the liquid oxygen valve that feeds the solid fuel inside the rocket's motor case wouldn't open more than 20%, failing to create enough thrust. &quot;The ignition fired, the rocket did not lift off, the computer shut down the sequence, and the rocket remained on the pad,&quot; a spokeswoman for the launch vehicle's maker, American Rocket Co. of Camarillo, Calif., explained. The rocket fell off its stand, and the liquid oxygen tank caught fire, reducing the rocket to charred debris.    There were no injuries, and damage to the launch area was &quot;minimal,&quot; the company said.    The rocket, powered by a hybrid of solid and liquid fuel, was to have been launched on a $2 million, 15-minute suborbital flight to test missile detectors on a satellite that could one day be used as part of the proposed Star Wars defense system, and to deploy a model of a heatshield parachute that might be used on a new re-entry vehicle in connection with the planned space station.    The company had paid the government to use the launch facilities at this Air Force base. It said it probably won't try a launch for at least six months. </TEXT></DOC>
