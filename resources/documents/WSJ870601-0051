Teets is an executive who seems to delight in change -- except the prospect of a change in control at Greyhound Corp.    In barely five years as chairman and chief executive officer of the Phoenix, Ariz.-based consumer products and service concern, Mr. Teets has disposed of more than a dozen subsidiaries, among them a $2 billion-a-year meatpacking unit and the big intercity bus business that gave Greyhound its name. Selling the &quot;mother company . . . was a gut-wrenching decision,&quot; Mr. Teets says.    Greyhound's quest for improved profit and a better return on equity has led it from slaughterhouses and bus lines to pizzas and cruise ships, among other businesses. Mr. Teets says the restructured Greyhound &quot;is a more attractive company.&quot;    Therein lies a problem. Someone apparently has bought a lot of Greyhound stock lately.    Last week, 5.2 million shares changed hands -- more than seven times the average weekly volume in the first four months of 1987 and about 13% of Greyhound's shares outstanding. From a close of $39.25 May 22, the stock jumped to a high of $46 a share Wednesday before closing Friday on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape at $43.75 a share, up $1.625.    &quot;Obviously, there has been enough activity to assume that someone is accumulating the stock, but no one has contacted us,&quot; Mr. Teets said during a phone interview Friday from the New York office of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., one of Greyhound's investment bankers.    Speculation about potential purchasers has centered on Irwin Jacobs, chairman of Minneapolis-based Minstar Inc., whose most recent foray in the takeover arena was a run at Borg-Warner Corp. Mr. Jacobs has declined to comment.    With an estimated breakup value ranging from $50 to $65 a share, Greyhound is an intriguing target for would-be raiders. It offers a trove of small and medium-sized businesses that could be dismantled easily.    But if a battle begins, it will be a bitter one. &quot;We haven't restructured this company just to see it taken over,&quot; says Mr. Teets, whose reputation as a strong executive is enhanced by his interest in weightlifting. Greyhound's 53-year-old chairman, who cuts an imposing figure with his muscular six-foot frame, steel-blue eyes and wavy silver hair, adds: &quot;I am determined and persistent.&quot;    But not inflexible, he asserts. &quot;If you're tough like granite you fall apart, but if you're tough like leather, you can be hit all day long. Like leather, I give just enough, but not too much.&quot;    Outsiders agree that Mr. Teets won't buckle under pressure. &quot;I think you can absolutely count on Teets not to succumb to greenmail,&quot; says Katherine M. Stults, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Greenmail involves a company buying a hostile suitor's stake at more than the market value.    Greyhound's plight illustrates the dilemma of corporate restructurings. &quot;Soothsayers claim managements that don't do anything are targets; but if you're doing a good job in restructuring, you also become a takeover target,&quot; says Mr. Teets.    The executive, who is deeply religious, compares the &quot;intimidation that goes on today on Wall Street&quot; with Goliath and the Philistines. &quot;David had three stones to take on the giant; he used only one,&quot; Mr. Teets says. &quot;But the moral of that story is to always have three stones.&quot; Greyhound has a slew of anti-takeover measures in place and recently supported its stock price by buying about 13% of its shares outstanding. At April 30, Greyhound had about 38.6 million shares outstanding.    Greyhound profit jumped 55% last year to $186.2 million, or $4.09 a share, but more than one-third of that came from nonrecurring items and discontinued operations. Revenue, at $3.09 billion, was nearly flat. Greyhound showed a 16.3% return on average holder equity, but discounting the nonrecurring gains, the company fell far short of a 15% target set by Mr. Teets.    While many companies have realigned operations, few have done so voluntarily on as large a scale as Greyhound. Along with the bus business and sizable chunks of its revenue, Greyhound has cut its work force nearly in half since Mr. Teets took charge in 1981, leaving about 27,000 employees today. In recent months, more than a quarter of the 400-member corporate staff has taken early retirement, quit or been dismissed. These cuts have resulted in what Mr. Teets -- who acknowledges his love of metaphors and parables -- calls &quot;a lean and hard-muscled base.&quot;    Greyhound had plenty of fat to cut after an acquisition binge that lasted more than 20 years. Under Mr. Teets's strong-willed predecessor, Gerald H. Trautman, Greyhound made forays into such businesses as computers, insurance, car rental and convention services.    In its biggest single diversification move, Greyhound ventured into the meatpacking and consumer-products business with the purchase of Armour andamp; Co. for about $400 million in 1970. The price was considered high. Though slaughterhouse operations produce fat revenue, they generally have lean profit margins. And Armour, with high labor costs and aging facilities, was barely profitable.    Earnings from Greyhound's dizzying array of businesses proved neither large nor reliable. For more than a decade, they were up one year and down the next, like a roller coaster.    Moreover, by 1980 Greyhound's management was in turmoil. Mr. Trautman had trouble leaving the driving at Greyhound to someone else. Two company presidents came and went in quick succession. Then, in a surprise move in 1981, Mr. Teets was named chief executive. He became chairman the following year, when Mr. Trautman, then 70 years old, retired.    Mr. Teets joined Greyhound in 1964 during the New York World's Fair to manage some restaurants -- just about the only profitable ones at the fair. He worked his way up to become the youngest subsidiary president in Greyhound's history. Mr. Teets then left and worked with three other companies in the food business over the next eight years before returning to Greyhound in 1976 as head of its food service group.    Lacking ties to Greyhound's other operations, Mr. Teets set about disposing many of them. Though a three-year plan was drawn up, it was revised each year. A former executive recalls that most decisions to sell operations were &quot;opportunistic.&quot; He adds, &quot;John Teets likes to manage businesses he's comfortable with.&quot;    At first, Greyhound's asset sales were modest. But in 1983 Mr. Teets put Greyhound on a war footing. Having decided that high labor rates were suffocating Armour, he first demanded substantial pay concessions from the company's unionized meat workers, then sold the facilities to ConAgra Inc. Just before the sale was completed, Greyhound closed the plants on a Friday. ConAgra opened them after the weekend as nonunion facilities.    Last December, the bus business also reached the end of the line when a tentative agreement that included substantial wage concessions was rejected by the rank and file. Barely two weeks later, Greyhound agreed to sell the 73-year-old business to a Dallas-based investor group for more than $350 million, including a 25% interest in Greyhound Lines. The workers had to take even steeper wage cuts than Greyhound sought.    With the sale of the meat and bus operations, union employment at Greyhound has shrunk to about one-third of its workers from nearly two-thirds when Mr. Teets took over. &quot;Mr. Teets thinks there's nothing wrong with collective bargaining -- as long as it's done on his terms,&quot; says Domenic Sirignano, president of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.    Greyhound's chief executive says he isn't anti-union. But he recounts how he saw his father, who had just started a small construction company in Chicago, stand up to union &quot;enforcers&quot; who were demanding featherbedding on a construction site. Mr. Teets was just 13, but he says the incident &quot;left a lasting mark on me.&quot;    While Greyhound's ability to wring cash from asset sales generally has drawn high marks, reviews of the company's acquisitions are mixed. Greyhound spent $246 million two years ago to buy the consumer products division of Purex Industries Inc. More recently, the company agreed to buy General Motors Corp.'s transit bus manufacturing business for an amount that wasn't disclosed. And just last week Greyhound announced an agreement to acquire in-flight catering and airport-terminal concession operations from Chicago-based Carson Pirie Scott andamp; Co. for $326 million.    &quot;What they've gotten into are relatively mundane businesses,&quot; says Carol Neves, analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;They aren't high growth or high technology&quot; operations.    Moreover, Greyhound has taken some troubling stumbles in the day-to-day management of its operations. Last year, for instance, profit plummeted at the Purex unit as a result of major marketing miscalculations. Two major alleged frauds have cropped up in the company's leasing operations. Even food service operations, which Mr. Teets knows well, have been hurt badly by the uneven economic recovery.    Mr. Teets concedes some of the problems shouldn't have happened. &quot;You never want to relearn lessons you already know.&quot; The executive, an unexceptional student in school, says it's vital to learn something new every day. &quot;You always want to stay a green apple,&quot; he adds. &quot;Once you get ripe, someone's going to come along and pick you off the tree.&quot;    Mr. Teets says that the marketing problems at Purex have been corrected -- among other things, the head of the division was replaced -- and that the purchase from Carson Pirie Scott is intended to counter the kind of cyclical earnings problems encountered in the food services operation.    Some of Greyhound's operating problems may have arisen because Mr. Teets and other top managers were concentrating on the bus business last year. &quot;John Teets really hones in on a single problem, and last year he was honing in on Greyhound Lines,&quot; says Ms. Neves of Merrill Lynch.    That raises the risk that a major takeover battle could present another distraction. Mr. Teets says he consults his investment bankers about raiders, but meditation in the form of prayer is important too.    &quot;My adrenaline flows all day,&quot; the executive says. &quot;It's important just to quiet down, grab hold of yourself, and recognize that in this great world we live in, 'This too shall pass.'&quot;    ---             The Transformation of Greyhound                                  1981        1988 Forecast* Services and food services ... 11.5%           43.6% Consumer products ............ 11.4%             27% Financial ..................... 8.5%           14.6% Bus Manufacturing ............. 5.2%           11.8% Transportation ............... 19.9%              3% Food ......................... 43.5%              0% Total Revenue ................ $5.16 billion   $3.2 billion Analysts' projections assuming completion of transactionsannounced to date</TEXT></DOC>
