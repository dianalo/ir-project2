The ordinance passed just after midnight by a vote of 9-4.   ``It's regrettable that we have to take this action because theLegislature didn't have the courage to,'' said Councilman DaveDoering.   Tom Gleason, a spokesman for Mayor Federico Pena, said theordinance will take effect once it is signed by Pena and published,probably next week.   The law carries penalites of $500 to $999 in fines and 10 to 120days in jail.   Residents who owned assault weapons before adoption of theordinance will be able to keep them, but they will be required toregister them within 60 days.   ``Criminals are going to behave like criminals,'' saidCouncilwoman Cathy Reynolds, who proposed the ban.   ``We have, however, made a small step to give police a tool toconfiscate _ what we now publicly consider anti-social weapons,when they are found in the course of their work, and we have sent amessage that these particular semiautomatic weapons are not welcomein the city and county of Denver.   ``I think that's the useful thing to do. It's not going to solvecrime and we never said it would,'' she said.   More than 700 people packed into Denver's City and CountyBuilding for a public hearing Monday night. A total of 297 peoplesigned up to speak against the proposal and 30 were in support, butsome did not get the chance to speak because the hearing ended onschedule at 11 p.m.   Gun enthusiasts held signs outside the chambers that read ``Banliberals, not firearms.''   At one point during the hearing, council members threatened toleave after one speaker called Reynolds a ``rapist'' of theConstitution.   The council staff turned off the microphone and the man left.   Police Chief Aristedes Zavaras spoke in favor of the ban.   Dennis Martin, president of the American Federation of Policeopposed it.   ``Recent research has opened new evidence that an armed publichas and is a powerful deterrent to crime,'' Martin said.``Offenders do recognize the gunowner as a potential threat totheir well being.''</TEXT></DOC>
