The rebels said their fighters shot down a Cobra helicopter ofthe Iranian air force that tried to attack their positions near thetown of Mehran, which they captured Sunday.   Mehran is about six miles east of this Iraqi town and 90 milesfrom the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.   Leaders of the National Liberation Army, as the rebel force iscalled, said they have no intention of holding Mehran, which has nocivilian population and is largely a pile of rubble and bent palmtrees.   Mehran itself was lightly held and resistance was minimal, butfighting for the positions in the foothills of the Kani Sakhtmountains to the north was reported fierce.   Occasional shellfire could still be heard Monday from Badrah.   The rebels worked feverishly Monday hauling massive amounts ofcaptured military gear back across the border to a rear stagingpoint in Badrah.   The National Liberation Army claims to have killed or wounded asmany as 6,000 Iranian government troops in Sunday's operation. Theyacknowledged 57 dead of their own and 120 seriously wounded.   Those figures were impossible to verify independently, but morethan 1,500 Iranian prisoners were brought to Badrah on Monday. Theysat in rank after rank in a large courtyard.   Not far away, scores of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-aircraftand anti-tank weapons, tons of small arms, machine guns and otherequipment were being dumped in a huge holding area.   The road to the holding area was filled with a steady stream oftrucks dragging the equipment back.   An Iranian colonel squatting in the dust with the otherprisoners and identifying himself as the deputy chief of staff ofthe 16th armored division said he was astonished at the rapidity ofthe rebel action.   ``We were in a state of alert,'' said Col. Ali Akbar Golamrezai,43. ``Until the night of the operation there had been no sign ofmovement in front of us. We expected a patrol to try a skirmish,not an attack of such a size.''   Among the captured equipment were 30 tanks, 25 155mmself-propelled howitzers, two 130mm cannons, six Katyusha rockets,cases of Sam 7 anti-aircraft missiles, 81mm mortars, 19four-barreled anti-aircraft guns, five armored personnel carriers,six 106mm recoilless rifles, 25 jeeps and 19 trucks.   There were heaps of small arms, radios, gas masks, helmets,binoculars and other equipment. The hardware was seized along the30-mile front.   Iran acknowledged Sunday that the town had been lost but said itwas taken by Iraqi forces using chemical weapons. Iranian newsreports monitored in Cyprus Monday made little reference to Mehran,except to say that its air force fighters attacked Iraqi positionsaround the town five times.   The war communique carried by the Islamic Republic News Agencysaid: ``Iran's Muslim combatants continued their battles with Iraqitroops with artillery, mortar and heavy weaponry.''   The National Liberation Army, mostly members or sympathizers ofthe Iranian Mujahedeen Khalq organization, burst across the borderearly Sunday. Its fighters, estimated in the thousands, routed twoIranian government divisions and a brigade, about 14,000 men inall, according to rebel officials.   The Iraqi government reiterated its claim that the force thatcrossed the border and captured Mehran was made up entirely ofdisaffected Iranians and called the battle ``an internal Iranianaffair.''   Mehran had changed hands five times in fighting between Iranianand Iraqi troops during the nearly 8-year-old war.</TEXT></DOC>
