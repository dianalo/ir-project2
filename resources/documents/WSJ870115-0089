A Census Bureau study released this week sharply contrasts with an earlier Harvard and Yale University report, which asserted that women who postpone marriage beyond their 20s may never find a mate.    The latest survey indicates that such women still stand a good chance of getting married. But for millions of American women, the question remains: Which study is more believable? And for demographers, the findings highlight how easy it is to arrive at different conclusions using similar data.    The Harvard-Yale study, released last summer, gave white, college-educated 30-year-old women just a 20% chance of marrying. Women at 35 were given a mere 5% chance; at 40 the odds dropped to a minuscule 1.3%. For black women over 30, the prospects were considered even dimmer.    The study prompted considerable concern among the growing ranks of single professional and managerial women. But some of those concerns may have been exaggerated. According to the Census Bureau, single 30-year-old women have a 58% to 66% chance of getting married. And it says the chances are still 17% to 23% at age 40.    The differences in the studies' conclusions reflect the two approaches taken by the researchers. The Harvard-Yale study uses a complicated mathematical model to project future marriage rates. To determine the marriage rates of college-educated women who are now in their 30s, for example, the researchers tracked the rates of those women when they were younger and found that for each year past the peak marriage age of about 26 the rates declined. They then projected that the rates would continue to fall each year as the women became older.    &quot;Our statistics showed that only a relatively few people wed at very early ages and very old ages,&quot; says Neil Bennett of Yale University, co-author of the study.    By contrast, Census Bureau researchers simply used marriage certificates and other population data from 1978 and 1979 to determine the total marriage rate of women in their 30s. They then assumed that this rate would not change in the future.    &quot;Our study assumes a constant rate&quot; says Campbell Gibson at the Census Bureau. Although the study's conclusions were based on two years of data, government researchers did examine decades' worth of figures, Mr. Campbell notes. &quot;We know from vital statistics that rates of first marriages for women over 25 have changed very little in the past 10 years.&quot;    But one demographer's vital statistics may be another's rejects. The Census Bureau method &quot;is extremely susceptible to errors,&quot; says Yale's Mr. Bennett. &quot;They've assumed marriage rates of 1978 will hold true for the next half century, and we know already that is incorrect.&quot;    Other demographers aren't partial to either study. Many believe that the Census Bureau's methodology is overly simplistic, while the Harvard-Yale model is overly complicated.    Cheryl Russell, editor of American Demographics magazine, says the Census Bureau study is too rigid. &quot;You can't say that what . . . women did 40 years ago is what 30-year-old women will do today,&quot; she argues. &quot;In fact, the chances are they wouldn't do the same things.&quot;    By comparison, Ms. Russell believes, the Harvard-Yale study's mathematical model is sounder. But, she admits, she doesn't &quot;fully understand it.&quot;    Even demographer Ansley Coale at Princeton University, who devised the model used by the Harvard-Yale group, isn't entirely comfortable with the study's conclusions. &quot;I'm pretty sure the model works if you look at all women in the U.S., but I have some concern about how accurate it is to just look at college-educated women.&quot;    Adds Gloria Jacobs, an editor at Ms. Magazine: &quot;We are a generation of women who are doing nothing that's predictable. We've broken every previous pattern about how women are supposed to live and there's no reason to think we won't break them again.&quot;    The demographers responsible for the studies concede that only time will tell who is correct. &quot;The bottom line,&quot; says Yale's Mr. Bennett, &quot;is neither of us will find out who's right for 20 years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
