DICKERSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BIG PINE KEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The gentle Key deer who inhabit theFlorida Keys are so cute it's killing them.   Emboldened by handouts from well-meaning residents, many of the   Bambi-esque creatures have been run over by cars while crossinghighways in search of food.   The smallest species of white-tailed deer in the nation, theendangered animals roam among the ever-increasing houses on thisisland, nibbling roots, homeowners' plants and flowers _ andbegging for snacks.   ``A few days ago, a young one was eating our tomatoes. I wentout to take its picture and he trotted up to me for a handout,''said island resident Grace Manillo.   ``They'll sit there and be cute and beg for food. They'll eatanything. It's the deers' undoing _ you can love them to death,''added Deborah Holle, manager of the National Key Deer Refuge.   The deer, about 2 feet tall and 70 pounds when full grown, willeven munch marshmallows and potato chips, said Holle.   ``We have one herd fed junk food daily. We noticed two of themwith the worst coats we've ever seen.''   But poor coats are the least of the deer's troubles. Dogs andwild pigs maul them. About a fifth of all newborns drown in ditchesdug years ago to control mosquitoes. They lack sufficient freshwater. Development is whittling away their habitat outside the7,400-acre federal refuge. And the handouts make them lose theirsavvy, becoming easy prey for poachers.   The handouts, which are illegal, have a more insidious effect:They make the deer bold enough to cross busy streets to reachhouses where they can count on snacks.   Between 1980 and 1987, 345 of the 431 deer found dead on BigPine Key and the several neighboring keys they also inhabit werekilled by cars.   Cars killed all but eight of the 31 found dead so far this year,prompting Holle to spend $20,000 from the refuge budget for extraMonroe County Sheriff's deputies to ticket speeders on nearbyroads. But she fears more of her 250 precious wards may soon die onthe highway.   Compounding the problem is a controversial road first proposedin 1985 to siphon off traffic from often-clogged U.S. 1, the maindrag through this island. The road would cut through primedeer-roaming territory, and is opposed by the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, which manages the refuge; the Florida Game andFreshwater Fish Commission and local environmentalists.   But area residents overwhelmingly favor the road so they canavoid U.S. 1, and say objections to the route come too late.   ``The route was published in newspapers. We followed the countyattorney's advice. We picked a route able to move people in themost efficient way with the least disruption to the environment.Now people are yelling, `Key deer!''' said Bill Becker, who foundedthe committee that drew up the highway plan.   Said Mrs. Manillo: ``We need a bypass road, but I'm notconvinced that's the place to put it. But some say people are moreimportant than the deer, and get annoyed. They are inconveniencedby the deer.''   Holle said the deer have always struggled. ``It was never agarden of Eden here. They had storms, and fresh water was probablythe biggest limiting factor.''   The refuge was established in 1957 to save the 50 deer thatremained then. In 1967, the deer received endangered speciesprotection, and by 1978, the population grew to about 400. Now it'sdwindling again, mostly because of development that destroyshabitat and brings cars, says Holle, who spends $2 million a yearto add land to the refuge.   But she fears her efforts may not save the deer from extinction.   ``They have a very low reproductive rate,'' says Holle. She alsoviews the proposed road as a deer death trap.   Mrs. Manillo agreed.   ``The deer run right out into traffic,'' she said. ``Peoplespeed. The deer kills go on and on and on.''</TEXT></DOC>
