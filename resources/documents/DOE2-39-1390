Methods developed in EPRI's lakeacidification mitigation project (LAMP) for determining how much limestoneto add, predicting the effective period of a liming, and predicting chemicalchanges in treated lakes are now sufficiently developed for operational-scaleliming programs. 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
