That, at least, was how several analysts who track GM reacted yesterday to the buyback program the auto maker announced late Tuesday. &quot;Initially the stockholders will feel very positive about this, but after a while they'll understand the nature of the risk involved,&quot; said Charles Brady, an analyst for Oppenheimer andamp; Co.    GM can afford the share buyback, but some question whether it's a wise strategy for the company at a time when the auto maker's basic business is struggling and it already is a net borrower.    Investors certainly felt positive yesterday. GM's regular common shares, as many as 20% of which could be repurchased by the company by 1990, surged $3.875 to close at $79.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. GM's Class E and Class H common shares -- which have their own buyback program -- also posted gains. Class E shares closed at $39.125, up $1.625, and Class H shares closed at $42.875, up 37.5 cents.    But analysts say that the cash GM would have to spend to buy back all the shares -- more than $5 billion at current market prices -- would further stretch a company that has been weakened financially by several years of high capital outlays and lackluster sales. Indeed, they note, because GM has been spending more money than it takes in, it already is eating into its cash reserves -- in essence borrowing money from itself -- to avoid cutting its dividends.    &quot;You're in a war here because there are too many car plants and somebody isn't going to make it,&quot; H. Ross Perot, the former dissident director who left the GM board in December, said yesterday. &quot;In a war you don't waste your ammunition, and in business your ammunition is money. I rest my case.&quot;    Mr. Brady estimated that even if U.S. car sales remain flat in 1987, GM will have a $200 million negative cash flow this year after paying $1.6 billion of dividends to shareholders. If GM then spends $750 million or more to buy about 10 million common shares, the first installment of the planned three-year buyback program, negative cash flow would jump to about $1 billion.    Mr. Brady said that if auto sales turn down sharply -- a scenario forecast by some economists -- GM will have to cut its dividend or fail to follow through on the share buyback. In either case, he said, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith, who took office in 1981, &quot;would be in very, very serious trouble.&quot;    A recent report by analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. presents a similar analysis. GM's total cash outlay in 1985 and 1986 exceeded cash inflow by some $4.5 billion, he said, and he expects cash flow to remain negative for the rest of the decade. &quot;The company is probably paying too much in dividends,&quot; Mr. Healy said.    Ironically, Mr. Healy regards the buying surge in GM stock as &quot;a big opportunity to lighten up one's position&quot; in GM common shares. He has given a &quot;weak sell&quot; recommendation to clients, based on his belief that earnings will decline and there will be pressure to cut the dividend.    GM doesn't &quot;quibble with the characterization&quot; that it is a net borrower, a company spokesman said yesterday. But even competitors note that GM has plenty of room to borrow.    The more than $5 billion that GM would shell out to complete the program is &quot;one whale of a big number, (but) over four years I think GM can digest it easily,&quot; said Fred Zuckerman, treasurer of Chrysler Corp.    GM, whose directors approved the idea of a stock buyback last fall, is clearly betting that improvements in its business will help finance the program. The money for the buyback will come from &quot;the cash flows generated by reduced capital spending and anticipated performance improvements,&quot; the company said in announcing the buyback plan. The company said that its capital spending will fall to $7.9 billion this year and $5.8 billion in 1989, from last year's $10.6 billion.    Indeed, GM is &quot;finishing up a massive capital spending program,&quot; noted Mario Gabelli, a New York-based money manager. He added: &quot;For the first time in 20 years of my following the company, they're actually going to do something for shareholders.&quot;    But so far, there aren't many signs of fundamental improvement in GM's business. Analysts expect earnings for the first half and all of 1986 to fall sharply, as the company cuts production to adjust to its lower share of a somewhat weaker market. For the last four months, including the February results reported yesterday, GM had only 38% of the U.S. new-car market. That's far below its traditional 45% share.    If the fundamentals don't improve, the share buyback might not deflect criticism from Mr. Smith -- who has taken a lot of it in the wake of the company's buyout of Mr. Perot's stake and GM's 1986 performance. The company is &quot;putting on some cosmetics,&quot; Mr. Gabelli said. &quot;But this isn't going to make a toad a princess, or Roger Smith a prince.&quot;    One GM manufacturing executive said the company's plan is &quot;another challenge to our organization to improve our profitability so we'll have the funds to buy the shares. &quot;The stockholders deserve some reinforcement and that's one way to do it.&quot;    But others noted that the move to reward shareholders comes at a time when the company is demanding sacrifices from employees.    The company is slashing its white-collar staff by 25%, and has said its middle managers will get lump-sum payments instead of merit raises, and that they will no longer get premium pay for overtime. Hourly employees aren't getting profitsharing payments this year, even though their counterparts at Ford Motor Co. are getting an average of $2,100 each. But top executives and managers are still getting bonus payments, although in smaller amounts than last year's.    &quot;This is just another example showing that the only ones GM cares for are the executives, the stockholders and people like Perot,&quot; said Stanley Marshall, a United Auto Workers executive board member. &quot;There's nothing for the workers. They (the company) certainly are asking for a long strike this fall,&quot; when GM's current contract with the UAW expires.    Both Chrysler and Ford have undertaken aggressive stock buyback programs. Chrysler has bought 22% of its stock since December 1984, according to Mr. Zuckerman, who estimated that Ford has bought just under 10% in the same period. He called the buybacks &quot;a way to demonstrate concern for shareholders' wealth.&quot;    Mr. Zuckerman said a buyback doesn't necessarily mean an auto company is throwing in the towel on its own prospects for returning to a higher level of capital spending. &quot;What we are saying implicitly at Chrysler is, I believe I have invested adequately in my own business, and have more cash than I need for that.&quot;    Many companies in mature, slower-growing industries have in the past several years increasingly taken on debt and bought their own stock to improve returns to shareholders.    By contrast, fast-growing companies, or companies in high-technology fields where capital spending and research are crucial to success, tend to keep lighter debt loads. One example is International Business Machines Corp., which, despite a few token share buybacks, has kept its debt to a minimum and continued to spend aggressively on research, plant and equipment.    Some Wall Street analysts say that GM may be unable to follow through on its commitment to buy the shares if its business continues to deteriorate.    &quot;It looks great on paper that GM will buy back 20% of its stock,&quot; said Suresh Bihrud, an investment strategist at First Boston Corp. &quot;But the question that may be worth asking is, are they going to have the cash flow? And then if they cut back too much on capital spending, the next issue is, can they keep designing competitive new products?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
