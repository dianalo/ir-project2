The effect ofinterpulse time separation and pulse width have been investigated experimentally.Intensity enhancements of up to 7x above steady-state, with extractionefficiencies in excess of 60% of the steady-state value, were obtainedby amplifying a train of 0.4-nsec full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) pulsesseparated by 5 nsec.</TEXT></DOC>
