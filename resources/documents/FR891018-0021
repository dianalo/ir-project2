This species is currently known only from a singlepopulation in the Little River system in northeast Alabama (De Kalb andCherokee Counties) and northwest Georgia (Chattooga County). A historicalpopulation from Town Creek (De Kalb County, Alabama) has not been locatedand is believed destroyed. This species is extremely vulnerable due toits restricted range and the clearing of the river banks for silvicultural,residential, agricultural or mining purposes. This proposal, if made final,would implement Federal protection provided by the Act for <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3>.

However, during his studies, Kral discoveredearlier collections made in 1899 by the Biltmore Herbarium collectors fromLittle River and from Town Creek on Sand Mountain by Harper in 1951 (Kral1982, Whetstone 1988). The Town Creek population in De Kalb County, Alabama,has not been relocated despite extensive searches and is believed destroyed(Kral 1982, 1983; Whetstone 1988). Currently <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> is only known to occur in the Little Riverdrainage system of Lookout Mountain. This species is primarily locatedin the upper undammed reaches of the Little River in Cherokee and De KalbCounties, Alabama. It has been collected from a single site in the EastFork of the Little River in Chattooga County, Georgia (Whetstone 1988,Whetstone <T3>et al. </T3>1988). On rare occasions, individuals have been locatednear the mouth of tributaries (Whetstone 1988). Extensive surveys of otherriver systems with suitable habitat in northeast Alabama and northwestGeorgia have been unsuccessful at locating additional populations (Whetstone1988).This species is a member of the water-plantain family (Alismataceae) andis in the ``graminea'' complex of <T3>Sagittaria.</T3> Distinguishing characters include a stout, elongatedrhizome, hairy filaments, linear leaves and spreading or reflexed sepals(Kral 1982, Whetstone 1988). <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> is a submersed to emersed aquatic perennialarising from a stiff elongated rhizome up to 10 centimeters (cm) (4 inches)in length. The leaves are of two types, depending upon the velocity anddepth of the water it inhabits. In swift shallows, the leaves are linear,rigid and sickle-shaped, 5-8 cm (2-3 inches) long and 2-5 millimeters (mm)(0.08-0.20 inches) wide. In quite, deep waters, the leaves are more quill-like,being longer (10-30 cm) (4-12 inches), linear in shape and tapering. Separatemale and female flowers are produced on a stalk, 10-50 cm (4-20 inches)long. The petals are inconspicuous in the female flowers: however, in themale flowers, they are white and 1.0-1.5 cm (0.4-0.6 inches) long. Thefruit consists of a cluster of achenes approximately 2 mm (0.08 inch) inlength. Although infrequent, flowering occurs from May into July and intermittentlyinto the fall (Kral 1982, 1983).This taxon typically occurs on frequently exposed shoals or rooted amongloose boulders in quiet pools up to 1 meter (3 feet) in depth. Plants arelocally distributed, where suitable habitat exists, and grow in pure standsor in association with various submergents including <T3>Potamogeton, Najas, </T3>and<T3> Myriophyllum </T3> and emergents such as <T3>Justicia americana, Lindernia, </T3>and <T3>Polygonum. </T3>The immediate banks are often dominated by a thicketof shrubs including <T3>Alnus, Rhododendron, Kalmia, Lyonia, </T3>and <T3>Ilex. </T3>Sphagnous seeps are frequent with <T3>Carex, Rhynchospora, Eriocaulon, Panicum, Xyris, </T3>and <T3>Rhexia</T3> among the common genera present. The stream bottoms aretypically narrow and bounded by steep slopes (Kral 1982, Whetstone 1988).Two endangered plants, <T3>Sarracenia oreophilia </T3>and <T3>Ptilimnion nodosum, </T3>and several candidate plant (<T3>Cuscuta harperi, Coreopsis pulchra, Allium speculae</T3>) occur inassociated habitats at several sites.Approximately 40 percent of the habitat in Little River is owned by theAlabama Power Company, and 20 percent by the Alabama Department of Conservationand Natural Resources (DeSoto State Park). The remainder is in privateownership.On September 27, 1985, the Service published a revised Notice of Reviewfor plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 39526), which included <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> as a category 2 species. Category 2 comprisesthose taxa for which listing as endangered or threatened may be appropriatebut existing information is insufficient to support a proposed rule. In1986, the Service contracted a status survey to assess its rarity and evaluatethreats to this species and its habitat. This report (Whetstone 1988) andother information support its proposed listing as a threatened species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> Kral (Kral's water-plantain) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3><T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> is only known from the Little River drainagesystem in northeast Alabama and northwest Georgia. A major threat to thisspecies is the elimination or adverse modification of its already limitedhabitat. Clearing of the adjacent river banks for silvicultural, residential-recreationaldevelopment, surface mining or agricultural purposes poses a significantthreat for this species. These activities contribute to water quality degradationand increase stream turbidity and siltation from erosion (Kral 1983, Whetstone1988). Similar impacts likely caused the loss of the population and muchof the suitable habitat in the Town Creek watershed (Kral 1982, 1983).The Little River population may be adversely affected by eutrophicationfrom garbage dumping and leaking sewage systems. Large quantities of humancoliform bacteria were present in water samples taken at several sitesalong the Little River (Whetstone 1988). This eutrophication increasesthe presence of filamentous algae, which clings to individuals of <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3>. Extreme water turbidity and dense filamentousalgae decrease the amount of light available to the plants for growth andflowering.A small number of sites are accessible by fords and are often a centerfor recreational activity, subjecting them to damage by off-road vehicletraffic.Impoundments exist over large areas of presumed suitable habitat on theLittle River and may have destroyed undocumented populations. Four largeimpoundments exist along a five mile stretch of the West Fork of the LittleRiver and two are present below the Georgia locality on the East Fork.The impoundment of Lake Weiss in Cherokee County, Alabama, in the 1960sflooded suitable habitat along Yellow Creek and several miles of the LittleRiver. In the past, dams along two creeks, which flow into the Little River,have broken and flooded portions of suitable habitat. Cracks and leakshave been observed on the dam above DeSoto Falls and a portion of a damnear the Georgia population has deteriorated (Whetstone 1988). Severalexisting populations are threatened by unstable impoundments that couldbreak and eliminate or degrade populations and suitable habitat.Approximately 33 percent of the habitat and associated local populationswould be destroyed if a proposed hydroelectric impoundment is constructedon the Little River. In addition to flooding several local populationsand changing stream flow dynamics, associated construction would causeexcessive siltation and further degrade water quality (Whetstone 1988).However, the Little River site is presently viewed as the least desirablesite for this impoundment from an economic and environmental standpoint(John Grogan, Alabama Power Company, pers. comm., 1989).b. <T3>Over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educationalpurposes. </T3>This species is not known to be a component of commercialtrade; however, collection or vandalism could reduce populations in themore accessible sites.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Disease and predation are not known to befactors affecting the continued existence of this species.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3><T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> is informally listed as endangered inAlabama (Freeman 1984) and Georgia (T. Patrick, Georgia Heritage Program,pers. comm., 1989). However, this designation does not afford this speciesany legal status or protection. Plants located within the confines of theDeSoto State Park in Alabama are protected from collecting and adverseland use practices on the river banks. However, this provides protectionfor only 20 percent of the Little River population and the remaining sitesare unprotected. The Act would strengthen existing protection, provideadditional protection, and encourage active management for <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3>.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>This species' occurrence in a single stream system makes it extremely vulnerableto any catastrophic event. Flooding is frequent and intense in certainareas, particularly those portions of the river within high canyon walls(Whetstone 1988). When such occurs, the water scours the bottom, uprootingthe shallow-rooted <T3>Sagittaria.</T3> While a certain amount of flooding is natural, itsdetrimental effect is intensified due to the continuing loss of suitablehabitat.This species is clonal and reproduction is primarily asexual, which suggeststhere may be low genetic variability within this single existing population.Flowering was observed in only 1 percent of this <T3>Sagittaria </T3>and only in areas of direct sunlight and at a waterlevel that allowed emergent leaves (Whetstone 1988). Many of the sitessupporting local populations are in less than these optimum conditionsfor flowering: therefore, it is important to maintain as much suitablehabitat as possible to encourage reproduction by sexual means. Sexual reproductionincreases genetic variability, which enables species to adapt to changingconditions. Eight of the twelve local populations studied by Whetstone(1988) occur in pools and/or in partially wooded areas. Here, the numberof plants ranged from 5 to 40 individuals. The remaining 4 local populationson the shallow shoals supported 75 to several hundred plants.Algae blooms are common in the summer due to eutrophication in the LittleRiver (see factor A). <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> was observed to be completely coveredwith a filamentous algae at times, and this may have an adverse effecton this species' vigor (Whetstone 1988).The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia</T3> as threatened.Threatened status seems appropriate since this species is not in imminentdanger of extinction. However, this species is extremely vulnerable dueto its restricted range and could become endangered in the foreseeablefuture if protection measures are not taken. Critical habitat is not beingdesignated for reasons discussed in the following section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent forthis species. Publication of critical habitat maps will increase publicinterest and possibly lead to additional threats for this species fromcollecting and vandalism, particularly at the many accessible sites alongthe river (see factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'').Taking is an activity difficult to control and only regulated by the Actwith respect to plants in cases of (1) removal and reduction to possessionof listed plants from lands under Federal jurisdiction, or their maliciousdamage or destruction on such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, diggingup, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of any State law orregulation, including State criminal trespass law. Such provisions aredifficult to enforce and no benefit can be identified through criticalhabitat designation that would outweigh the potential threats of collectingand vandalism All State agencies and Alabama Power Company have been notifiedof the general location and importance of protecting this species' habitat.Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recoveryprocess and through the section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it wouldnot now be prudent to determine critical habitat for <T3>Sagittaria secundifolia.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service.All known populations are under State or private ownership. A hydroelectricimpoundment has been proposed for a site on the Little River where plantsare known to occur. This would require a license from the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission. The Environmental Protection Agency would considerthis species relative to pesticide use.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seedsfrom cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from theseprohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appearson their containers. In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments(Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destructionon Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroyingof listed plants in knowning violation of any State law or regulation,including State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agentsof the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.72also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibitedactivities involving threatened species under certain circumstances.It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought or issuedbecause the species is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, VA 22203 (703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments orsuggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, thescientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningthis proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are soughtconcerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and populationsize of this species; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from thisproposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of publicationof the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed toComplex Supervisor (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Freeman, J.D. 1984.
