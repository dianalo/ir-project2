DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge has refused a government requestto appoint a watchdog for allegedly corrupt locals of theInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters.   But the judge allowed prosecutors an early trial date for themassive civil racketeering case.   U.S. District Judge David Edelstein on Thursday set Feb. 27,1989 for the government's lawsuit to oust reputed Mafia-dominatedmembers of the Teamsters' executive board.   Edelstein also indefinitely continued a temporary restrainingorder he issued at the government's request last week and which hadbeen due to expire Friday. The order barred the executive boardfrom either making large expenditures of union funds or destroyingunion records.   Federal prosecutors had sought a preliminary injunction that,among other things, would have created one or more court-appointedliaison officers to police corruption among the hundreds of localsin the 1.6 million-member union.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, however, did not see the rulingas a setback.   ``The court has extended the temporary restraining order untilthe time of the trial and has set the trial schedule on the fasttrack that we asked for,'' said Giuliani, whose office brought thelawsuit last week. ``From our point of view, this achieves almosteverything we wanted to get.''   Losing the bid for the liaison officers was not problem, saidGiuliani ``since we have a quick trial date.''   There was no answer at Teamsters headquarters in Washington whencalled for comment.   The liaison officers also would have been empowered to appointtrustees to run corrupt Teamsters locals and review expendituresand union constitution changes by the executive board.   But Teamsters attorney John R. Climaco asked Edelstein earlierthis week to give the union more time to counter ``what we considerthe false and shameful allegations by the government.''   Edelstein concluded that ``it would clearly be imprudent togrant the preliminary relief sought by the government without anevidentiary hearing.''   But, he added: ``It is apparent that the legal and factualquestions presented by this case require more time to prepare thanthe time within which a preliminary injunction hearing wouldtypically be heard.''   Instead, Edelstein decided to combine the hearing with the trialon the government's lawsuit.   The massive lawsuit claimed mobsters, wielding influence overthe executive board, have deprived union members of their rightsthrough shootings, bombings, beatings and a ``campaign of fear,bribes, extortion and theft.''</TEXT></DOC>
