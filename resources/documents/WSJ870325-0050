Nonmilitary spending would be cut $12 billion. But in future fiscal years, deficit reductions would be divided evenly among the three categories, until a balanced budget is achieved in fiscal 1991, in accordance with the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    Sen. Chiles, a Florida Democrat, has been meeting privately with the committee's Democratic majority and is expected to announce his proposal soon. The outlines of the plan are becoming clear, and are similar in many ways to a budget blueprint being prepared by the Democrat-controlled budget panel in the House.    Under the Gramm-Rudman law, both chambers of Congress are supposed to agree on a budget resolution by April 15.    The House Budget Committee is also trying to devise a plan that would trim the deficit by about $36 billion in fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. It voted last week to cut military spending by nearly $8 billion. It still is working toward a plan that would raise taxes by $18 billion and cut nonmilitary spending by $9 billion. In all cases, the reductions are from levels anticipated by the Congressional Budget Office rather than from fiscal 1987 levels.    Both the House and the Senate plans defy two major budgetary tenets of President Reagan and the majority of his Republican Party. Neither comes anywhere near the GOP demand to reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit limit of $108 billion in fiscal 1988. A reduction of about $36 billion would fall about $26 billion short of the Gramm-Rudman target.    In addition, the president and many congressional Republicans have taken a hard line against a tax increase and are threatening to use the Democrats' interest in taxes as a political weapon in coming elections.    Sen. Chiles argues that though his plan misses the Gramm-Rudman goal in fiscal 1988, it still brings the deficit to zero by 1991 as the law seeks. He also asserts in his draft proposal that he would cut the deficit by at least as much as the president does in his own budget plan in the first year.    The cut in military spending for fiscal 1988 amounts essentially to a freeze of budget authority at the fiscal 1987 level. In actual outlays, that's a reduction of about $6 billion from what spending would be without any cuts.    In nonmilitary spending, the largest component is an ill-defined &quot;entitlement reform&quot; package that presumably would trim farm subsidies and Medicare. Other social-program spending would be held to fiscal 1987 levels.    So far, the Republicans on Capitol Hill are refusing to participate in the budget debate, except as adversaries of the Democratic majority. Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) of the House Budget Committee said that he and the other committee Democrats will meet without Republicans and approve their own budget. Sen. Chiles also acknowledged that the Senate Republicans are withholding their cooperation until the Democrats move first.    One leading Republican, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, said he plans to introduce today a measure to make the nonbinding budget resolutions more meaningful. Congressional Republicans have been insisting that any budget compromise this year must be followed through, beyond a budget blueprint, with actual budget reductions.    Sen. Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said his proposal would help enforce budget decisions. It would impose a two-year budget cycle with two-year appropriation bills, limit the use of catchall spending bills and enhance the president's authority to rescind government appropriations. The White House said yesterday that it endorses the general outline of the proposal.    In the meantime, White House Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan might not veto an increase in taxes on wine or beer if data showed that such taxes are &quot;too low.&quot; Mr. Miller said he expects Mr. Reagan would veto an increase in cigarette taxes, however. The president pledged to do so last year during James Broyhill's unsuccessful Senatorial campaign in North Carolina, Mr. Miller explained in an interview after a speech yesterday. He added that the administration isn't considering an increase in the wine or beer tax.    While President Reagan has spoken out against tax increases, his latest budget includes some and he has generally confined his veto threats to tax rate increases. </TEXT></DOC>
