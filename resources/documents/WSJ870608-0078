All the beneficiaries {of the deduction} are high-income earners, not simply some of them. It leads to extra-large swimming pools, extra bedrooms in Beverly Hills, but no housing for the people who need it most. Still, when this issue was last voted on in Congress, 85 out of 85 senators present voted for it. The only surprising thing, given the number of beneficiaries, is that somehow the other 15 senators didn't manage to get their names on the roll call. </TEXT></DOC>
