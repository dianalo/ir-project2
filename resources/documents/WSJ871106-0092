Major U.S. banks lowered their prime lending rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 8 3/4%, the second cut since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. Other short-term rates also fell and bond prices surged, continuing an explosive rally that began about three weeks ago.    Prices of some actively traded long-term Treasury bonds rose more than 1 1/2 points, or over $15 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on 30-year issues fell to about 8.80%, the lowest since mid-August and down from 10 3/8% in mid-October. The Treasury sold $4.78 billion of 30-year bonds yesterday at an average yield of 8.79%.    Falling interest rates helped propel stock prices higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 40 points to 1985.41.    West Germany's central bank helped spark yesterday's bond market rally by cutting its Lombard rate to 4 1/2% from 5%. The cut in the Lombard rate, which is the highest short-term rate the Bundesbank charges commercial banks for generally temporary borrowings, came on the heels of rate cuts earlier this week by the Bank of England and the Dutch central bank.    While the Bundesbank's Lombard rate isn't as significant as its discount rate, which was left unchanged, the West German central bank confirmed its easier credit stance by arranging market intervention at lower rates. Moreover, Treasury Secretary James Baker has emphasized that the Reagan administration is determined to keep the economy growing, even if that means a lower dollar.    &quot;The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have made it very clear their primary objective is to avoid a recession and provide sufficient liquidity to the markets, which in my translation spells lower interest rates, at least for the near term,&quot; said Richard C. Keller, senior executive vice president of Marine Midland Bank Inc.    Falling interest rates will help bolster economic growth, many analysts agree. &quot;First and foremost, this is not 1929. Anyone who thinks so is almost surely wrong,&quot; said Frederick W. Zuckerman, treasurer of Chrysler Corp., one of many companies that recently have announced plans to buy back their own stock.    Mr. Zuckerman, though, worries that huge U.S. budget deficits could hurt both the stock and bond markets. &quot;Congress has to do something real about this budget deficit,&quot; he contended. The notion that the budget deficit doesn't matter &quot;is intellectually bankrupt,&quot; he added.    &quot;Washington sets the tone for what goes on in the capital markets,&quot; Mr. Zuckerman said. Thus, &quot;I'm in a wait-and-see mode at the moment&quot; about investing Chrysler's pension funds.    Chrysler's $3.5 billion pension fund now has about 35% of its assets in stocks, down from 50% at the beginning of October. The pension fund also now has 35% in cash and 25% in bonds, with the rest in real estate and other investments, he said. At the beginning of October, it had about 35% in bonds and 8% in cash, he added.    The unprecedented drop in interest rates here during the past three weeks already has convinced many economists that the U.S. will avert a recession next year. But some say there is a growing risk of inflation reviving at a higher rate in the years ahead.    &quot;The reaction of central banks world-wide cannot but strengthen inflationary forces world-wide,&quot; said David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's largest commercial bank. &quot;Everything being done now will increase inflation over the next three to five years,&quot; said Mr. Kern. He has predicted a 5% U.S. inflation rate annually through 1990 and adds: &quot;I see no reason to downgrade this figure, and there is a major risk it will be higher,&quot;    As a result, Mr. Kern said yields on 30-year U.S. Treasurybonds &quot;will be higher than they are now in the next 15months, and they will exceed 10% by the end of 1988.&quot; TheU.S. budget deficit &quot;has become a psychological and politicaltest for the U.S. to put its house in order,&quot; he said.   Yesterday's cut in the prime, or base, rate reflected recent declines in banks' own borrowing costs. Some analysts said the only surprise was that banks didn't reduce their prime rates by at least half a percentage point. They noted, for example, that the federal funds rate and other short-term money market rates, such as on bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper, have dropped especially sharply lately.    In the week ended Wednesday, for example, the federal funds rate averaged 6.43%, down from 7.03% the previous week and the lowest weekly average since late April, according to a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Yesterday, the rate on funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.60%, Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. estimated.    The prime rate usually is a lagging indicator of rates in general and isn't necessarily a sign of what lies ahead. Also, bankers usually are much slower to lower their rates than they are to raise them.    &quot;The prime cuts came as no surprise, given the already substantial decline in rates on bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills in recent weeks,&quot; said Jean Buckley, a money market economist at Bank of America, San Francisco.    Chase Manhattan Bank was the first major bank yesterday to reduce its prime rate, and it was soon followed by most other major banks. On Monday, Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C., lowered its prime to 8 3/4%, but all of the largest banks left their rates unchanged.    The prime rate is watched closely because it is used by banks as a base rate on loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Also, it is being used increasingly as a base rate on many types of consumer loans, such as home-equity loans.    However, the nation's biggest companies pay little or no attention to the prime rate because they usually can borrow at significantly lower rates. Banks are willing to offer them rates well below prime in order to discourage these companies from turning to alternate markets, such as commercial paper.    The bond market rally came despite another significant drop in the dollar in the foreign-exchange markets.    Among the major developments in the credit markets yesterday:    --The Treasury's outstanding 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose to 101 from 99 3/8 Wednesday as the yield declined 0.15 percentage point to 8.78%, the lowest level since July 23, according to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bonds auctioned yesterday hovered around 8.79%.    --Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds increased 19.04 points to 1271.84. It ranged between 1264.08 and 1273.52.    --Interest rates rose on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill rate rose to 5.62% bid from 5.54% bid Wednesday. The rate on the latest six-month bills were quoted late yesterday at 6.04% bid, up from 6.01%.    Among the new corporate offerings yesterday was a $150 million issue of Export Development Corp. notes due November 1992. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced the 8 5/8% notes at 99.622 to yield 8.72%, or 0.55 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year note. The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Yesterday's other offerings included:    --A $100 million issue of McDonald's Corp. sinking-fund debentures due November 2017. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the 9 3/4% notes at 98.833 to yield 9.872%, or 1.03 percentage points more than the Treasury's 30-year bond. The issue is rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P. McDonald's is a fast-food company based in Oak Brook, Ill.    In the municipal market, underwriters increased the size of a New York City bond offering to $750 million from $600 million, according to the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. Yields ranged from 5.75% on bonds due in 1988 to 8.75% on bonds due in 2017.    Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year bonds:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                        30-year Bonds    Applications ........................... $20,023,582,000    Accepted bids ..........................  $4,777,902,000    Accepted at low price ..................             76%    Accepted noncompetitively ..............    $308,000,000    Average price (Rate) ...................  100.844(8.79%)    High price (Rate) ......................  100.844(8.79%)    Low price (Rate) .......................  100.844(8.79%)    Interest rate ..........................          8 7/8%   The bonds are dated Nov. 16 and mature Aug. 15, 2017.</TEXT></DOC>
