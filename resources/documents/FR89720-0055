(312) 972-2518</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Transportation Program of the DOE'sOffice of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) addresses a mandateof the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), which requires the DOE to establisha safe, secure, and efficient transportation system for moving spent nuclearfuel and high-level waste. To that end, the DOE requires the cooperationof and input from, among others, representatives of State Governments.The CVSA, whose membership includes representatives from 46 States and10 Canadian territories and provinces, is the only association of Stateagencies responsible for conducting commercial vehicle inspections. TheDOE's purpose for renewing the cooperative agreement is to enable it tocontinue to interact directly with the transportation industry and theStates through their memberships in the CVSA, in developing standards forinspection of highway truck shipments of spent fuel and high-level nuclearwaste. Prior to the cooperative agreement, which has been in effect since1986, the CVSA had conducted similar work on hazardous materials transportationfor the Department of Transportation. Moreover, the CVSA has already submittedto the DOE a draft of highway vehicle inspection procedures, and renewalof the cooperative agreement to provide for validation of those procedureswould be a logical extension of the work performed to date.The CVSA has proposed to contract with appropriate agencies within a coregroup of States in order to conduct the pilot study. The agencies selectedby CVSA will represent State vehicle safety, inspection and/or enforcementagencies, and will have the ability to meet the requirements for a validtest of the draft inspection procedures.Eligibility for renewal of the cooperative agreement award is being restrictedto CVSA because of its past experience with the DOE and its unique institutionalties and expertise. The estimated total cost of the 60-month cooperativeagreement with CVSA is $1,488,521. The proposed award date is September1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Chicago, Illinois, on July 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edwin H.
