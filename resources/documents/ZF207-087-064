and the partners say no other researchers in the world havedeveloped such an comprehensive digital neural chip: front-ended by aconventional processor, an array of the chips could be used for fuzzymatching applications, and the developers reckon they can raise the speed ofit up to 1,000-fold.andM;Fujitsu Ltd has brought out a low-price Japanese-English machine translationsystem built around its G-100 series workstation: called Atlas-G, the newsystem is claimed to do high-quality machine translation equivalent to thatpresently possible only on a mainframe - except that it needs a lot of userintervention with translation being done as the text is typed in, a processthat increases productivity of pencil-and-paper translators by a claimed 80%;Fujitsu has also developed an expert system to teach people to write betterJapanese, impertinently pointing out sentences that it thinks too long andwords it deems inappropriate, as well as highlighting missing characters andother typos before going on to recast the original Japanese sentences to makethem more amenable to translation into fluent English.andM;It's still one of the heaviest freely traded (in its own market) share in theworld, but scandal-wracked Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp's shares are ashadow of their former selves, down at Y=1.68m, almost half its Y=3.2m peak,and dangerously near its Y=1.6m flotation price - and increasing competitionfor NTT means that even after the Recruit Cosmos scandal drops from theheadlines, other considerations will limit upside potential for what began asJapan's proudest privatisation.andM;AST Research Japan is right up with the company's operations in othercountries, launching the new Bravo 286 AT-alike at what for Japan is a recordlow price of $1,824 for the floppy disk model - $1,584 with no disks at all:AST is planning to sell both under its own name and OEM to integrators ofmachines conforming to the AX Japanese language AT standard; it hopes to sell1,000 machines this year, and 500 of the Premium 386, which costs $6,384 with40Mb disk drive in Japan.andM;Toshiba Corp is stepping up overseas production of its top-selling laptopcomputers, and is looking for a site to make the things in Europe; it is alsoraising output at Toshiba America Inc to 15,000 a month from 10,000.andM;The Japanese Finance Ministry is to set up a communications network ofpersonal computers to ensure the prompt transmission of information on newgovernment bond issues between members of underwriting syndicates, followingthe introduction of an auction system for long-dated Japanese Governmentstock in april: the construction of the network is partly a response topressure from foreign banks in Japan that feel at a disadvantage under thecurrent system where information on government bond issues is given to thepresiding banks of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, whichtransmits it on to other members of the syndicate by ordinary means - mail orwhatever; a new information centre will also display Reuters and Teleratedata.andM;NEC Corp is moving to consolidate its now numerous US holdings in thetelecommunications sector: over the past two years, NEC has acquired amaintenance services company in California, ESI Inc; PABX and push-buttonphone distributor EPI Telephones, also of California; and NMI, its maindistributor of car telephones and radiopagers, with which it hopes toincrease its market share in the mobile telephone equipment sector; NEC isalso planning to take a 40% holding in the MTI Communications subsidiary thedistributor of its PABXs, Marcom Telecommunications Inc.andM;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co is to present 200 ASR-12 telex machines to theChinese government for use in the developing trade zone of Hainan: the telexmachines have come back off lease from customers around Japan and are fullydepreciated, so KDD is not really being too generous, but the Chinese aredoing well out of it - it has donated 2,000 all told.andM;Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp has developed a &quot;Simple Monitor System&quot;that can send monochrome moving images over the phone company's INS-64 ISDNnetwork: images from video cameras mounted in 16 locations can beautomatically interchanged, being sent in standard mode at a rate of onescreen per second, and in high-speed mode at three screens per second; thesystem consists of a transmitter and receiver and an operating device, allmanufactured for NTT by Hitachi, and the prime use is likely to be in banksand other places where security surveillance is needed.andM;Cadence Design Systems Inc, San Jose is dedicated to discovering the Orientin its quest to become the worldwide leader in the integrated circuit designautomation software market, and is now forming Cadence Design Systems Japan:the new unit intends to &quot;add value to Japanese customers specific technologyrequirements&quot;, and providing much closer support to its distributor, InnotechCorp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
