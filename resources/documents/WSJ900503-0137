A year ago, Motorola Inc. scored a technological coup overJapanese and European rivals with its MicroTac, a cellularphone that fits easily into a pocket. Now, in trying to domore than merely catch up, competitors are altering the tinycircuitry in these phones to extend battery life betweenrecharges. By reducing power consumption, two rival phonemakers have prolonged battery life and doubled the 30-minutetalking limit MicroTac offers with its standard battery.   NEC Corp.'s Mobile Radio Division is pushing the P-300,which offers 80 minutes of talk time. NEC finagled the extraminutes through a 30% reduction in power-hungry circuitry.   Engineers at L.M. Ericsson have designed a pocket phonewith larger, more efficient filters in its transceiver to cutpower drain. This summer, Ericsson GE Mobile CommunicationsInc., a Lynchburg, Va., joint venture between the Swedishtelecommunications giant and General Electric Co., plans tobegin selling the unit, called Hotline, in the U.S. Althoughan inch longer than MicroTac, the Hotline is already a bigseller in Scandinavia, according to Ericsson and GE.   Ericsson-GE isn't stopping there. In a move that surprisesindustry watchers, the venture also says it will have adigital phone the size of Hotline within a couple of years.Digital phones are considered the phones of the futurebecause they are more efficient, but it's generally assumedthat the first digital phones, which must also work with thecurrent analog transmission networks, won't be very small.   Ours will be, Ericsson-GE says. &quot;A large phone will have ahard time finding a market,&quot; says Fleming Orneholm, vicepresident of Ericsson Radio Systems. &quot;We will fight Motorolato the line.&quot;   Motorola declined to comment on its competitors.                                                                                                          New Kind of Disk Aims   For a Hit on the Radio                                                                                                          RADIO STATIONS may be able to quit fumbling with bulkyaudio tapes for commercials.   Computer Concepts Corp. has designed a personalcomputer-based system that stores up to 340 minutes of audioprogram on a single computer hard disk. The Lenexa, Kan.,company says the system allows stations to cue up crisper,clearer jingles and other radio fare without the bother ofmyriad, separate tape cartridges.   Key to the system's operation is a computer board thatplugs into a PC and attaches to the broadcaster's audioequipment. Electronic chips on the board convert a tape'sanalog audio sound to digital and store it on the disk. Eachprogram is also cataloged according to its play time andschedule for airing. An operator at the PC can then retrievewhat he wants and, by pushing a button, put it on the air.   &quot;Today, a radio station has three or four tape playersthat can get dirty and muddy the sound,&quot; says companyPresident Greg Dean. &quot;This is CD-quality sound, only it's ona computer rather than laser disk.&quot;   It costs about $22,000 to equip a production studio andcontrol studio, and the staff would require totally newtraining. Still, radio stations have tested the system withgood results and about a dozen have put in orders.                                                                                                          A Computer Uses an Eye   For Its Hearing Aid                                                                                                          GEORGE BUSH, a computer may accept your challenge.   Ben P. Yuhas, a graduate student at Johns HopkinsUniversity, is training a computer to read lips. Mr. Yuhas,who works in the school's electrical and computer engineeringdepartment's speech-processing lab, says people unconsciouslylip-read to augment their hearing when conversing in a noisyplace. He figures a speech-recognition computer with the samelip-reading ability could operate better on a factory flooror in other noisy spots.   Rather than use a conventional computer, which operatessolely on a program, Mr. Yuhas is using a &quot;neural network&quot;system that learns how to solve problems by mimicking thethought processes of the brain. Mr. Yuhas videotaped a man'smouth forming vowel sounds and fed the information into theneural computer. When this visual reference was combined withacoustic patterns of speech, the recognition system was ableto overcome its difficulty with background noise.   When could all the video and other components from Mr.Yuhas's research be combined into a commercially applicablesystem? Read his lips: Not until after the next election.                                                                                                          High-Tech Sherlock   Tracks Down the Beep                                                                                                          COMPUTER CROOKS beware: Identifax Computer RecoveryBureau, Setauket, N.Y., is offering a security registry thathelps police trace stolen personal and laptop computers.   The system uses software called COP (Computer OwnerProtection), which lets the owner program a specialidentifying beep that sounds when the computer is turned on.When the police come across a machine they suspect is stolen,they can call Identifax, hold a phone next to the computer asit is turned on, and Identifax's central data bank willidentify the beep and the computer's owner.   &quot;We're hitting the education market first since they'rethe ones that get hit the most,&quot; says Warner Loeb, Identifaxpresident. The company has already equipped the StateUniversity of New York at Stony Brook with COP and has acontract to register computers at John Jay College ofCriminal Justice in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
