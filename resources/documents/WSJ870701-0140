Compaq earned $9.6 million a year earlier. Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer, said per-share earnings in the latest quarter were higher than analysts' estimates, which range between 40 cents and 64 cents a share. &quot;We will be higher than the highest of that range,&quot; Mr. Canion said.    The company said it had about 39.9 million shares outstanding in the second quarter; if Compaq earns at least 64 cents a share, net income will be at least $25.5 million.    Earnings of 64 cents a share would be an 88% rise from the 34 cents earned in the year-ago period. In last year's second quarter, Compaq had 28,130,000 shares outstanding.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Compaq shares jumped $3.375 to $46.875.    Sales for the period &quot;exceeded $250 million,&quot; Mr. Canion said, also topping analysts' expectations of between $200 million and $230 million and improving by at least 70% last year's second quarter sales of $147.1 million. Compaq computers range in price from about $2,000 to about $9,000.    The increases -- similar to gains the company has registered in previous quarters -- indicate that Compaq's products are faring well despite new competition and uncertainty created by International Business Machines Corp.'s new line of personal computers that debuted on April 2. IBM's new line deviates in certain ways from the standard design IBM created in 1981. Compaq's computers are based on that 1981 standard.    Mr. Canion attributed the company's second-quarter sales growth to &quot;acceptance of the company's front line products&quot;: the Deskpro 386, which is built around Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 microprocessor; the Deskpro 286 models, which Compaq upgraded with a faster microprocessor earlier this year; and the Portable III. The microprocessor is a complex of integrated circuits on one silicon chip that performs the computer's basic computations.    Mr. Canion was cautious, however, about drawing conclusions regarding the success of the new IBM line. &quot;I'd hesitate to go beyond (our) numbers and say this is proof of anything. But it does clearly say there are a lot of buyers out there who haven't switched over&quot; to the (new) IBM models, Mr. Canion said. </TEXT></DOC>
