<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-1136 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new 2-dimensional position sensitive semiconductor detector was developed.With this detector the correlation between implanted fusion productsand their subsequent {alpha} decays can be improved. The position resolutionof the detector will be described as a function of the position. Measurementswith {alpha}-particles and a model of the detector will be presentedand the results for the correlation technique are demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
