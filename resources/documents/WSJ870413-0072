The six biggest British banks had for the past three weeks refused to contribute their share, protesting that not enough money had been committed by U.S. banks.    After discussions among the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of England and major U.S. and British banks, a compromise was agreed to late last week, with major U.S. banks committing slightly more money, bankers said.    Citicorp's chairman, John Reed, used his visit to London last week to talk to the major British banks and appeal for their cooperation. Angel Gurria, director of Mexico's Office of Public Credit, said in an interview in Washington Friday that the governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, had assured him the British banks now would sign the Mexican loans.    But despite the U.S.-British compromise, the same sources said, U.S. banks still haven't committed 90% of their share of the $7.7 billion of loans. Early last week U.S. banks had contributed about 83% of their share, and the British banks had said they would wait until U.S. banks had contributed 90% of their share before signing the Mexican loans. &quot;We think one or two big U.S. banks have put in a bit more,&quot; said a British bank spokesman, who said he didn't know what percentage of the U.S. contribution was in place. &quot;We know it isn't 90%,&quot; he added.    U.S. banks are expected to contribute about $2.6 billion of the $7.7 billion in new loans to Mexico.    Now that the British banks are contributing to the loans, Mexico will draw on the money as planned at the end of this month, Mr. Gurria said. Bankers said it will give them time to concentrate their energy on completing a debt rescheduling agreement and new loans for Argentina.    That country and its major creditor banks spent Saturday negotiating in New York, and are making good progress toward a debt rescheduling and new loan agreement which will allow smaller creditor banks to opt out of a projected new bank loan of about $1.9 billion, banking sources said. Citicorp, which chairs the bank committee negotiating with Argentina, declined to comment on the meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
