The estimated $500 million to $600 million a year that could beraised from the fee, the Federation for American Immigration Reformsaid, could finance intensified border patrols and the replacementof 28 miles of metal fence that has become so dilapidated it cannot``withstand the onslaught of humanity.''   ``Everyone has the right to lock his own back door. Those whoignore the lock and enter without permission are guilty of breakingand entering,'' the group said in a report that also proposedbuilding 25 miles of sunken concrete fences in San Diego and ElPaso, Texas, where the Border Patrol makes 70 percent of its 1million arrests annually.   The non-profit group's proposals, called ``Ten Steps to SecuringAmerica's Borders,'' went substantially beyond plans by theImmigration and Naturalization Service to build a $2 million,4-mile-long, 14-foot-wide ditch along the San Diego border. Theditch, intended to stop vehicular traffic, is expected to becompleted by the fall.   One author of the report, retired Border Patrol Chief Roger P.Brandemuehl, said the INS ditch would not stop people trying tosneak across the border on foot.   His organization proposed, instead, 12-foot sunken concreteretaining walls topped by 8-foot metal fences along the San Diegoand El Paso border segments.   The 28 miles of metal fence currently in place along the southernborder is so dilapidated that it ``could not keep a small child outof a basketball court,'' said Patrick Burns, the group's assistantdirector.   ``It simply cannot withstand the onslaught of humanity,'' hesaid. ``It is attacked by everything from blow torches tobulldozers.''   The user fee would provide $200 million to build the new barriersplus another $200 million for more Border Patrol agents andsurveillance equipment in isolated areas, said Patrick Burns, thegroup's assistant director.   Burns said that ``anyone who can't afford two bucks shouldn't becrossing an international boundry'' and pointed out that peopleflying into the United States already pay a $10 fee.   The group said 90 percent of the arrests of illegal aliens occuralong just 200 miles of the 2,000-mile southern border.   The report was written with the cooperation of the INS, whichsaid through spokesman Verne Jervis that it was ``studying thestudy.''   Jervis said INS currently has 4,000 Border Patrol agents, mostlyalong the border with Mexico. He acknowledged that the metal fenceis poorly maintained and that ``it's easy to cut, it's easy topenetrate.''   He acknowledged that a user fee might enable INS to hire moreinspectors at border crossings, thereby shortening the oftenthree-to-four hour wait.   The federation's advisory committee includes former AttorneyGeneral William French Smith; ex-Sen. Walter D. Huddleston, D-Ky.;former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm, and John V. Lindsay, former mayorof New York City.   Both the federation's proposal and the INS plan drew criticismfrom the League of United Latin American Citizens.   That organization's national political director, Arnoldo Torres,said physical barriers ``will only exacerbate tension and problems''along the border.   Torres said the federation was trying to ``play to the fear'' ofillegal immigration.   He said his organization has send President Bush and AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh telegrams urging them to reconsider the4-mile ditch plan.   Torres said many Hispanic leaders in San Diego have approachedhis group to support ``civil disobedience on the physicalconstruction of that ditch.''   ``There is that strong a conviction of Hispanics along the borderthat they were willing to do that,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
