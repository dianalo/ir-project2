Background</ITAG>EPA issued a proposed rule on July 3, 1986 (51 FR 24393) stating how theAgency proposed to interpret FIFRA with regard to advertisements concerninguses of pesticides not permitted by registrations issued under FIFRA section3, including uses allowed by FIFRA section 5 experimental use permits orFIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions, uses of unregistered pesticides,use of a registered pesticide for any other unapproved use, and uses thatare the subject of registrations under FIFRA section 24(c). The rationalefor the proposed rule was given in the preamble to that proposal. Exceptas modified by this document, the reasoning set forth in that preambleapplies to the final rule adopted today.The proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>under 40 CFR Parts 153 and 166. However, sincePart 153 pertains to general statements of policy and interpretations underFIFRA, the provisions that proposed to add Subpart A, andSection;153.12 toPart 153 have been moved to new Part 168, Subpart B, andSection;168.22 inthis final rule. EPA intends to place enforcement policies in this newPart 168.In this preamble, the part and section numbers as proposed (Part 153, andSection;153.12)are used in the discussion of the comments. There have been no numberingchanges to the Part 166 amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments</ITAG>Comments on the proposed rule were received from nine organizations. Thecomments are available for public inspection at the Office of PesticidePrograms Reading Room, Rm. 236, Crystal Mall Building andplusmin;2, 1921Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday except legal holidays. The comments and Agency responsesare discussed in Units II.A. through H.A. Experimental Use Permits (EUP)One commenter endorsed the Agency's proposal to treat as unlawful any advertisingof a pesticide for an EUP use. However, another commenter favored allowingadvertising for an EUP use if the advertisement states that use must bein accordance with the conditions of the EUP. This commenter also saidthat EPA Policy and Criteria Notice No. 2162.3 (1981) conceded that advertisementsof experimental use permit pesticides are not unlawful.The Agency disagrees with the comment that favored allowing advertisingof an EUP. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, under agencyregulations an application for an EUP must specifically identify participants,location of participants, and acreage involved prior to approval. Advertisementof EUPs thus serves no useful purpose, but could encourage the sale oruse of a pesticide for an unauthorized use.Policy and Criteria Notice No. 2162.3 (1981) was rescinded recently. ThatNotice did not ``concede that advertisements of experimental use permitpesticides are not unlawful.'' The Notice said the following: (1) It isunlawful to advertise a use covered by an EUP if the product has any registereduses; (2) advertisements for products that have not yet been registeredwill not be the subject of enforcement action if the products are not availablefor sale; (3) ads that do not refer to the experimental use status of [unregisteredand unavailable] products are not unlawful, but are discouraged as potentiallymisleading; and (4) advertisements for EUP products should be qualified.The Agency's experience over the past six years indicates the need forchanges in those interpretations. Thus, this rule sets forth EPA's currentviews.One commenter expressed concern about the purported broadness of the Agency'sinterpretation regarding EUP uses. The commenter apparently thought thatEPA meant to treat as unlawful the use of product testimonials from EUPparticipants in advertising that appears after product registration occurs.In response, EPA advises that product testimonials from prior EUP participantsappearing after a product is registered for the use in question would notbe regarded as unlawful so long as testimonials used in the advertisementsare consistent with approved uses and do not differ substantially fromthe claims of the final registration.A commenter questioned whether the information in EUP technical bulletinscan be considered as advertising.The Agency would not regard distribution of EUP technical bulletins asunlawful if the information contained therein regarding the pesticide didnot extend beyond that contained in EPA's approval, if the limitationson use were clearly specified, and if information in such bulletins didnot otherwise promote sale or use of the pesticide.Ideally, the Agency believes that EUP technical bulletins should be furnishedonly to persons signed on as EUP cooperators or participants. However,the Agency recognizes the difficulty of controlling the distribution ofthese bulletins.B. Emergency ExemptionsWith regard to advertising of a pesticide for a use authorized by a FIFRAsection 18 emergency exemption, two commenters opposed the EPA proposalto treat as unlawful any advertisements not placed by the retail dealerswho sell the pesticide. The commenters favored allowing the manufacturerto place advertisements. One commenter opposed any advertising of emergencyexemptions.The Agency disagrees with the commenter that opposed any advertising ofemergency exemptions. When an emergency occurs, it is important that thoseaffected receive helpful information to alleviate the situation. The majorissue is confinement of the pesticide use to the geographical area of theemergency.The Agency agrees with the commenters that oppose limiting advertisementsof emergency exemptions to only those placed by retail dealers. After furtherconsideration, the Agency believes that no purpose would be served by restrictionson who may place or sponsor the advertisements, as long as the other provisionsof the regulation are followed.C. Special Local Needs RegistrationsThere was only one comment on this subject. The commenter supported theAgency's proposal to treat advertisements of special local needs registrationsas unlawful unless they comply with the limitations set forth. However,the commenter suggested that the requirement for use of 6-point type forthe notice of restrictions in printed advertisements might be inadequateto catch users' attention.The Agency believes that the 6-point type size requirement is adequate.By ``printed advertisements'' EPA means to refer to printed magazines,newspapers and similar materials, not to text in television ads, billboards,or other media unlike magazines or newspapers.D. Unregistered ProductsThe Agency proposed to treat as unlawful the advertisement of unregisteredpesticides, but to make an exception for the advertisement of unregisteredpesticides that are not available for purchase by potential users anywherein the United States. Several commenters supported this approach, whiletwo commenters objected to allowing any advertisements of unregisteredproducts, finding such an approach inconsistent with FIFRA's registrationscheme.After consideration of comments, EPA has decided to withdraw the exceptionfor the advertisement of unregistered pesticides that are not availablefor purchase in the United States. As noted by the commenters, allowingadvertising of unregistered pesticides is inconsistent with a statutoryscheme which requires that pesticides be registered and that the marketingof these pesticides be based on claims evaluated by EPA in the registrationprocess. Allowing the advertising of unregistered pesticides may subvertthe registration process by encouraging demand for section 18 emergencyexemptions. Further, under the rule as proposed, manufacturers could sponsoradvertising containing unsubstantiated claims up to the day of registrationeven though following registration such advertising would be illegal undersection 12(a)(1)(B). In sum, the potential for abuse under this exceptionto the ban on advertising of unregistered pesticides far exceeds any informationbenefits gained by users through the advertising of unapproved pesticides.Further, the Agency considers cancelled pesticide products to be unregistered.Therefore, the advertisements of a cancelled pesticide product, inconsistentwith existing stock provisions of the cancellation order, is unlawful.E. Unregistered UsesA commenter opposed any restriction on advertisements of registered productsfor unregistered uses. The commenter argued that such advertisements wouldnot lead to misuse if they are properly qualified.The Agency disagrees with the commenter. The Agency feels strongly thatads for unregistered uses of a registered product are likely to resultin misuse. A person who can buy a registered pesticide, and who sees anad for an unregistered use of that pesticide, may be tempted not to waituntil registration of the use before buying and using the pesticide productfor that use.The commenter also argued that the proposed rule was at odds with FIFRAsection 2(ee) and the Agency's statement of policy under section 2(ee)(46 FR 51745, October 22, 1981). Also, the commenter noted that the Agency'sPolicy and Criteria Notice No. 2162.3 (1981) stated that such advertisementsare lawful if they are properly qualified.Regarding FIFRA section 2(ee), the commenter raised a valid point. As amatter of policy, EPA generally has permitted a person to advertise FIFRAsection 2(ee) uses even if they are not uses that have been registered.EPA, however, has explicitly limited this policy from extending to advertisingfor antimicrobial pesticide products targeted for use on human pathogens.51 FR 19174 (1986). Further, advertisements made under FIFRA section 2(ee)(1)pertaining to changes in the amount of diluent used in applying pesticidesfor forestry or agricultural purposes must be made in accordance with theAdvisory Opinion issued in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 3, 1981 (46 FR 14965). The final interpretiverule has been amended to exclude those uses permitted by FIFRA section2(ee) subject to the above-noted policy.Policy and Criteria Notice No. 2162.3 (1981) was rescinded recently sinceit is in certain respects inconsistent with, and has been superseded by,this final rule.It should be noted that the Agency considers cancelled pesticide uses asbeing unregistered uses of a registered pesticide product. Therefore, theadvertisements of cancelled uses of a registered pesticide product, inconsistentwith existing stock provisions of the cancellation order, is unlawful.F. Advertisements in Media Which Reach Pesticide Users in Other CountriesThe preamble to the proposed rule requested comments on the advisabilityof regulation of advertisements that may reach users in another countrywhere the use advertised is not authorized. Two commenters argued thatsuch regulation would be beyond EPA's jurisdiction and would be unworkable.After further consideration, the Agency has decided not to attempt to addressthis subject further at this time.G. First Amendment IssuesTwo commenters suggested in general terms that the rule as proposed mightviolate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it does notaddress a substantial government interest, is not the least intrusive meansfor implementing the government interest, or both. One of those commentssuggested that the judicious use of increased civil penalties against blatantviolators of EPA's prior policy would be less intrusive. One commentersubmitted detailed arguments in support of the Agency's authority to regulatepesticide advertising and was of the opinion that the rule complied withthe First Amendment.For the reasons set forth in the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA believesthat the rule promulgated today complies with the First Amendment and thejudicial decisions interpreting it. The two general comments suggestingthat the rule would pose First Amendment problems do not purport to explainwhy that preamble discussion is incorrect. The preamble noted both thenature of the government's interest and the manner in which the restrictionswere tailored to be as unrestrictive as practicable in view of that interest.H. General Comments1. A commenter requested that the Agency consider if and how the rule wouldaffect publication of factual data and reports in scientific journals relativeto experimental use permits, unregistered products, or unregistered uses.It is not the Agency's intent to restrict the dissemination of scientificinformation to the scientific community. In this regard, the Agency doesnot consider the publication in scientific journals of articles reportingon scientific studies to be advertising. At the same time, however, itshould be noted that if a person uses a scientific journal article in anadvertising campaign, claims made in the journal article may properly betreated as if they were made originally by the person who placed the advertisement.See the decision of the EPA Administrative Law Judge in the recent FIFRAcivil penalty proceeding entitled <T3>In re Sporicidin International</T3>, No. FIFRA 88-H-02, slip op. at37 n. 30 (November 1, 1988).2. A commenter expressed concern that answering questions about a pendinglabel at a growers' meeting could be construed as ``suggesting or recommending''the use of a product.Generally, giving oral answers at a growers' meeting is not consideredto be advertising. This rule only applies to advertisements. In anotherregulation issued under FIFRA, EPA has defined advertising as: (1) Brochures,pamphlets, circulars, and similar material offered to purchasers at thepoint of sale or by direct mail; (2) newspapers, magazines, newslettersand other material in circulation or available to the public; (3) advertisementson broadcast media such as radio and television; (4) telephone advertising;and (5) billboards and posters. 53 FR 15987 (May 4, 1988).It is important to note, however, that this rule does not describe theuniverse of acts that are unlawful under sections 12(a)(1)(A) and 12(a)(1)(B).These sections are not limited to advertising. Sections 12(a)(1) (A) and(B) make it unlawful for any person to offer for sale any pesticide ifit is unregistered, or any registered pesticide if claims made for it aspart of its distribution or sale differ substantially from any claim madefor it as part of the statement required in connection with its registrationunder FIFRA section 3. In some circumstances, oral statements at a growers'meeting could be viewed as an offer for sale (section 12(a)(1)(A)) or aclaim made as part of distribution or sale of a registered product (section12(a)(1)(B)). Any person making such statements could be subject to theproscriptions in sections 12(a)(1)(A) or 12(a)(1)(B). For example, oralrecommendations for unregistered uses of a pesticide (except for uses authorizedby FIFRA section 2(ee)) made by a person with financial interest in thatpesticide is regarded by EPA as a violation of FIFRA section 12(a)(1)(B).For the purpose of FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(B), EPA believes that claimsmade in the kinds of advertising covered by this interpretative rule are``part of [the] distribution or sale'' of the pesticide to which the advertisingrelates. The rule limits its coverage to advertisements that (1) are placedby persons who are in the pesticide business <T3>and </T3>(2) recommend or suggest the purchase of pesticides for certainpurposes. FIFRA does not grant EPA plenary authority to regulate advertisingas such, and it is arguable that there can be advertising that is separatefrom and not a part of the distribution of sale of a pesticide (see, e.g.,the discussion of these matters in <T3>In re Sporicidin International</T3>, No. FIFRA 88-H-02, Slip op. at41-43 (Nov. 1, 1988)). In this rule, EPA is not seeking to define the outerreaches of its FIFRA jurisdiction over advertising claims, but merely tostate clearly its position with regard to claims in advertising that aremade ``to induce the * * * sale and use'' of a pesticide and that thereforeare a part of the distribution or sale of the pesticide. Id. at 43.3. A commenter indicated that the ``recommend or suggest'' language inandSection; 153.12(b) of the proposal is vague and ambiguous, and recommendedthe phrase ``promote the commercial purchase or use of'' instead. The Agency is not convinced that the phrase ``promote'' is clearer or morespecific than the phrase ``recommend or suggest.'' The commenter's realconcern (as ascertained by telephone inquiry) was that the Agency shouldnot attempt to prohibit ads that are designed to encourage farmers to enlistas cooperators in EUP programs in which the holder of the EUP plans tosell the pesticide to the cooperator farmer. The commenter argues thatthese sales are not on a ``commercial'' scale, but are merely designedto lower the cost of the EUP effort and, perhaps, to help the EUP holderto determine whether the cooperators think the EUP product is cost-effective.EPA does not intend to discourage such ads designed merely to solicit cooperationin EUP testing, whether or not cooperators will have to purchase the product,as long as the pesticide is not mentioned in the ad.4. A commenter expressed concern that the language of proposed andSection;153.12(a) would prohibit ``placing'' ads with an ad agency and that theact of placing the advertisement with an ad agency could subject the industryto enforcement action.The Agency disagrees with this interpretation. Section 153.12(a) makesit clear that to be covered by the rule, the ad must actually appear inan advertising medium to which users or the general public have access.The words in question were intended to make clear the class of persons_personsin the pesticide business who, directly or through others, cause ads toappear in public advertising media_who would be deemed to have violatedFIFRA. No violation would result if an ad did not appear or if, when itappeared, it conformed to the rule.It is also important to note that the use of the phrase ``place or sponsor''is meant to capture not only the action of originally causing the advertisementto appear but those actions taken subsequently to continue the publicationof the advertisement. Thus, an advertisement ``placed'' before the effectivedate of this rule would become subject to the rule after it became effectiveupon the taking of any action to ``sponsor'' continued publication of theadvertisement.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statutory Requirements</ITAG>In accordance with FIFRA section 25, EPA provided the FIFRA ScientificAdvisory Panel (SAP), the Secretary of Agriculture, the Committee on Agricultureof the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutritionand Forestry of the Senate with copies of this rule. The FIFRA ScientificAdvisory Panel waived its right to review and comment on the rule. TheDepartment of Agriculture reiterated its comment made at the proposed stageof this rule. That is, the Department has no difficulty with the rule buthopes the Agency will take great care before withdrawing a section 18 emergencyexemption so as to avoid punishing the user by removing the pest controltool because of some violation committed by a pesticide company. EPA agreeswith the Department's comment. No comments were received from either ofthe Congressional Committees.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Procedural Matters and Required Regulatory Reviews</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.A ``major'' rule is one which has an annual effect of $100 million or more,or results in a major increase in costs or prices, or has significant adverseeffects on economic activities. The Agency has reviewed this regulationand concludes that this rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million,and will not result in a major increase in costs or prices or have significantadverse effects on economic activities.This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget forreview as required by Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActAs required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), I herebycertify that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThis interpretive rule does not contain any information collection requirementssubject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 et seq.).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 166 and 168</ITAG>Advertising, Pesticides and pests, Policy statements, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.

In Part 166:a. The authority citation for Part 166 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 136-136y.</ITAG>b. By revising andSection; 166.7 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 166.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">User notification; advertising.</ITAG>(a) A State or Federal agency that obtains an exemption may notify eligibleusers of the availability of the exempted pesticide(s) through user groups,retail dealers, and other means. Notification may include distributingcopies of the section 18 approval letter, labeling, or other informationto eligible persons. (b) As set forth more fully in andSection; 168.22 of this chapter, EPA interpretsFIFRA sections 12(a)(1) (A) and (B) as making it unlawful for any personwho distributes, sells, offers for sale, holds for sale, ships, deliversfor shipment, or receives and (having so received) delivers or offers todeliver any pesticide, to advertise the pesticide for any use authorizedby an emergency exemption, except for advertisements that are placed inmedia that address only persons in the geographical area to which the exemptionapplies, state the name and address of one or more retail dealers whereusers may buy the pesticide, and contain a prominent notice of the limitationson use under the emergency exemption. EPA may withdraw an exemption ifthe use of the pesticide covered by the exemption is advertised unlawfully.2. By adding Part 168 consisting at this time of Subpart A, General Provisions,which is reserved, and Subpart B containing andSection; 168.22, to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 168_STATEMENTS OF ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND INTERPRETATIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Advertising </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">168.22 Advertising of unregistered pesticides, unregistered uses ofregistered pesticides and FIFRA section 24(c) registrations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 136-136y.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Advertising </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 168.22</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Advertising of unregistered pesticides, unregistered uses of registeredpesticides and FIFRA section 24(c) registrations. </ITAG>(a) FIFRA sections 12(a)(1) (A) and (B) make it unlawful for any personto ``offer for sale'' any pesticide if it is unregistered, or if claimsmade for it as part of its distribution or sale differ substantially fromany claim made for it as part of the statement required in connection withits registration under FIFRA section 3. EPA interprets these provisionsas extending to advertisements in any advertising medium to which pesticideusers or the general public have access. (b) EPA regards it as unlawful for any person who distributes, sells, offersfor sale, holds for sale, ships, delivers for shipment, or receives and(having so received) delivers or offers to deliver any pesticide, to placeor sponsor advertisements which recommend or suggest the purchase or useof: (1) Any pesticide for a use authorized under a FIFRA section 5 experimentaluse permit (EUP). (2) Any pesticide for a use authorized under a FIFRA section 18 emergencyexemption, except for advertisements that:(i) Are placed in media which address primarily persons in the geographicalarea to which the exemption applies. (ii) State the name and address of one or more retail dealers who stockthe pesticide. (iii) Contain a prominent notice of the limitations on use under the section18 emergency exemption. (3) Any pesticide for any use authorized only by a FIFRA section 24(c)special local need registration, unless the advertisement contains a prominentnotice of the limitations on use under the section 24(c) registrations.(4) Any unregistered pesticide for any use unless the advertisement isone permitted by paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section. (5) A registered pesticide product for an unregistered use, unless theadvertisement is one permitted by paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section.However, as a matter of policy, the Agency will not regard as unlawfulthe advertisement of uses permitted by FIFRA section 2(ee) provided theproduct is not an antimicrobial pesticide targeted against human pathogens(see 51 FR 19174; May 28, 1986).(c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a ``prominent noticeof the limitations on use'' is one which sets forth the limitations onuse in a manner reasonably likely to be understood by persons to whom theadvertisement is addressed. For printed advertising, this criterion willbe met by a legend in 6-point or larger type. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-399 Filed 1-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
