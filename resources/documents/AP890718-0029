Boucher said the U.S. is still investigating the reports of theinternecine killings, which apparently took place July 9 in theFakhar Valley northwest of Kabul.   ``We deplore this tragic and brutal act,'' he said. ``It can onlyplay into the hands of the enemies of a free Afghanistan. We urgethe Mujahedeen to focus on the vital work of improving unity andcooperation.''   Boucher said Peter Tomsen, Washington's special envoy to theMujahedeen interim government, is looking into the attack.   Preliminary information indicates the rebels were ambushed by arival Mujahedeen commander affiliated with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,Boucher said. Hekmatyar heads a faction of Islamic fighters whoreportedly have received aid from Washington.   ``The murdered commanders were returning from a strategy planningsession with Ahmad Shad Massoud,'' Boucher said, adding that Tomsenmet with one of Massoud's brothers last week.   Pressed on whether the incident might prompt U.S. human rightsconcerns, he said: ``We're looking into this incident and I'm surewe'll draw the appropriate conclusions.''   In the Netherlands, Secretary of State James A. Baker III wasasked at a news conference about reports of stepped up U.S.assistance to the rebels, who seek to bring down the Marxistgovernment in Kabul.   ``The policy of the United States has not changed,'' he said.``Our policy is to seek and support self-determination for theAfghan people in a number of ways and the nature and character ofthat support has not changed.''</TEXT></DOC>
