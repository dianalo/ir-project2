IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has decided to acquire a refining and marketing network outside its national borders, according to several industry sources.    The sources cautioned that the Saudi move into &quot;downstream&quot; operations won't start soon as the country first must build a team to identify the targets and methods of such a major international expansion.    The sources, who asked not to be identified, said the decision itself was made &quot;in principle&quot; by the Supreme Petroleum Council of Saudi Arabia, chaired by King Fahd, a little more than a year ago. But these sources said the former Saudi oil minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, took no serious interest in implementing the decision. Mr. Yamani, the sources said, was too preoccupied with the Byzantine aspects of international oil politics to pay much attention to the national oil industry.    The current oil minister, Hisham Nazer, is an activist who is intent on organizing and expanding the most vital aspect of the Saudi economy. He has extensive administrative and planning expertise as the architect of Saudi Arabia's successive five-year development plans since 1971 in his other capacity as planning minister.    Industry sources said the Saudi plan, as it unfolds, will challenge the international oil industry in territory that has been largely the preserve of Western oil companies. But many executives said the Saudi move was expected as a logical extension of expanding Saudi industrial development.    &quot;It makes a lot of sense for them to go downstream in order to guarantee outlets for their oil in the markets that need it,&quot; commented a senior British oil executive in London.    Within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, only two members, Kuwait and Venezuela, have adopted similar decisions. By far, Kuwait has emerged as the most sophisticated model of downstream expansion, which its nationally owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp. launched since 1983.    Kuwait has purchased refineries in Western Europe and complete distribution chains including thousands of gasoline stations in the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, Belgium and Luxembourg. It currently is expected to expand its operations further, in France and possibly the U.S. and Asia. Venezuela is operating on a more modest scale in the U.S. and in West Germany.    One well-informed Arab industry source said Mr. Nazer, who arrived in the U.S. last week for talks with government officials and who speaks today in San Antonio, Texas, to the National Petroleum Refiners Association, is &quot;mounting a broad public relations campaign . . . testing the waters.&quot; By contrast, Mr. Yamani only mixed with senior American oil executives privately in exclusive resorts or at one of his many luxurious homes.    Sources close to the Saudi oil ministry said Mr. Nazer is reorganizing his energy team and cutting down on what he sees as duplication of tasks by the Saudi-owned Aramco, which used to belong to four U.S. oil companies, and other oil industry organs, including Petromin, the Saudi national oil company, and the ministry itself.    Mr. Nazer also is quietly instituting an austerity campaign in the ministry, having sold several airplanes and ordered some senior officials to use commercial airlines for their trips. He is assembling his own team of aides, which isn't likely to include all of Mr. Yamani's previous assistants, sources said. &quot;He is a very methodical player,&quot; said a senior American oil executive who knows the Saudi minister.    A source from another OPEC country said Saudi Arabia last year looked at the network owned by Esso Italiana S.p.A., but lost interest in making a purchase under Mr. Yamani. The OPEC official, who is familiar with last year's Saudi deliberations, said that &quot;Mr. Yamani didn't have the authority to go and sign up deals at a time when his star was falling with the king.&quot;    The OPEC official cautioned that Mr. Nazer will have to move slowly too, as he lacks enough trained Saudi technocrats to organize quickly the managerial network necessary to run an expanded international operation. The official also said Saudi Arabia also may lack for the moment the funds for such an extension. &quot;Venezuela and Kuwait went ahead at a time when oil prices were high and they had money. Today oil prices are low and money is hard to come by for all oil producers,&quot; the official said. </TEXT></DOC>
