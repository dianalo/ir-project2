Method: Fibers containing more than 1 mmol/g of carboxyl groupsare bonded with heavy metals, or they are impregnated with an aqueoussolution containing water-soluble heavy metal salts dissolved therein.Fibers as the substrate may be any of forms such as short fibers, longfibers, fiber tows, webs, threads, knitting or woven products, non-wovenfabrics, etc. It is however necessary that fibers contain more than 1mmol/g, preferably, from 2 to 7 mmol/g of carboxylic groups. Since heavymetals having radiation shielding performance are bonded to the outerlayer of the fibers and the inherent performance of the fibers per seis possessed, excellent radiation shielding performance can be obtained,as well as they can be applied with spinning, knitting or weaving, stitching,etc. thus can be used for secondary fiber products such as clothings,caps, masks, curtains, carpets, cloths, etc. for use in radiation shieldings.(Kamimura, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
