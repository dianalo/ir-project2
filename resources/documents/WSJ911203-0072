Granted, inaction by Congressis usually better than the alternative, but this is a case ofIt's Broke, But Nah, Don't Fix It.   Think back to this time last year. The idea was that banksshould get into businesses that have a more solid futurethan, say, issuing credit cards to high-risk individuals.Otherwise, risky lending by banks could lead to enormousbailout costs a la Sandamp;Ls.</LP><TEXT>   The only question was whether we'd get full or partialreform. One plan included abolishing federal depositinsurance and letting commercial banks merge at will withinvestment banks or industrial firms. The moderate proposalwas to continue deposit insurance while linking it to theriskiness of a bank's portfolio, and to let commercial banksmerge operations but not accounts with investment banks orindustrial firms. There were arguments favoring non-bankbanks and allowing banks to market insurance and otherfinancial devices. Everyone serious about a modern systemagreed that risk diversification required full interstatebanking.   The banking bill that Congress passed last week includednone of the above reforms. Instead, it will force more banksout of business. A line for the 1990s: Why do you think theycall it bankruptcy?   Other than an additional $70 billion for the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., Congress's answer, as usual, is moreregulation. Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate BankingCommittee and Keating Five member, said with no apparentshame that the problem is &quot;very little corrective action wastaken early in the game.&quot; The bill demands new audits andforeclosures when the capital-to-asset ratio falls to 2%.This means banks won't let their ratio come close, whichmeans more cautious lending, which means a prolonged creditcrunch.   Part of the problem was the typical gridlock of competinginterests. Some securities firms wanted to maintainGlass-Steagall to keep commercial banks out of theirbusiness. Small banks wanted to keep big banks far away. Manyinsurers played NIMBY with banks.   The larger problem is political. The inept TreasuryDepartment said it favored reform, but never got active WhiteHouse backing. John Dingell didn't want bankers in anysecurities business -- a decision he no doubt made on themerits rather than fear of losing any of his own committeejurisdiction. Congress even blocked reforms in the states,including Delaware's plan to let banks underwrite insurance.No one expects the Democrats to allow a better bill as weenter a presidential election year; a prolonged recession istheir best issue.   Banking and credit are too serious to be left to whatpasses for the policy-making process these days. This is toobad because the federal government is up to its eyeballs inbank regulation. The do-nothings who came up with thisnon-solution leave banks less able to cope -- and with noprospect for relief. For the economy, that isn't healthy.</TEXT></DOC>
