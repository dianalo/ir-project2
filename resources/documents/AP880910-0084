Before leaving Rome on the 10-day journey, the pontiff said hehopes he can help solve some of white-led South Africa's problemson a future trip there.   His fourth journey to Africa and his 39th abroad will be toBotswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe _ allcountries less than 20 years old that vehemently oppose SouthAfrica but depend on it for economic survival.   In an unusual statement Friday, the Vatican emphasized the popewas not snubbing South Africa and hoped to visit the country in thefuture. It said the pope's full schedule on this trip made a stopthere impossible.   The statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruledout a visit to South Africa, where a white minority rules 26million blacks.   During nearly 10 years at the helm of the Roman Catholic Church,John Paul has strongly denounced apartheid.   ``No system of apartheid or separate development will ever beacceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races,''he said in a 1985 address in the Netherlands.   In May, the pontiff received Anglican archbishop and 1984 NobelPeace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, who defiantly invited arrest andprosecution Sunday by urging a boycott of Oct. 26 municipalelections in South Africa.   Tutu's challenge to the government came two days after the SouthAfrican law and order minister, Adriaan Vlok, said the time hadcome to ``clip the wings'' of church leaders who hide behind the``mask of liberation theology.'' Earlier this week, police armedwith a search warrant seized a tape of Tutu's sermon at thearchbishop's Cape Town office.   When the pope greeted Tutu and other South African clergymen inMay, he said the system of racial segregation has exacted a``terrible toll.'' Tutu urged tougher sanctions by Western nations_ an issue on which the Vatican has not taken a position.   South African Roman Catholic bishops, who have worked closelywith Anglicans, were waiting for the pope at his first stop in theZimbabwe capital of Harare. They are attending a conference ofregional bishops there.   After a meeting with Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, the popeplanned to address the 71 bishops in a Dominican convent. Thespeech, one of 42 drafted during a summer vacation in themountains, was expected to set the tone for the 12,400-mile voyage.   In a document issued two years ago, the Vatican said it wasperfectly legitimate for the oppressed to take action _ such aspassive resistance _ to secure structures and institutions in whichtheir rights would be respected.   But it warned clergy against direct involvement in politics andagainst any efforts to inject Marxism into church work on behalf ofthe poor.</TEXT></DOC>
