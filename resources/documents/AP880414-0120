Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep. Louise Slaughter, both New YorkDemocrats, wrote Shultz on Wednesday to point out published reportsthat one of the Kuwaiti jet hijackers may be Imad Mughniyeh, whothey said may have been the chief kidnapper of American hostageTerry Anderson.   ``We know the United States is not a primary party to theAlgiers negotiations. But if Terry Anderson's chief kidnapper isone the Kuwaiti jet, the United States government must insure thatthe negotiators are aware of this fact,'' Moynihan and Slaughtertold Shultz.   ``It would be a travesty for Imad Mughniyeh to go free whileTerry Anderson remains a captive,'' they said.   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped more than three years ago.   The independent Kuwaiti newspaper, al-Qabas, quoted unidentifiedsources Wednesday as saying Mughniyeh was believed to have boardedthe plane when it stopped in Iran after being hijacked on a flightfrom Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait.   Moynihan and Slaughter did not ask Shultz to directly involvethe United States in the negotiations to free the hostages beingheld aboard the jumbo jet in Algiers.   But, they said, ``we must not let any possibility for hisrelease remain unexplored or any effort left undone.''   ``We ask you to give this matter your immediate attention,''they wrote Shultz. ``Please keep us informed about any informationthe State Department or other government agencies learn about thislinkage between the hijacking and Terry's kidnapping as well as anysteps you take to secure Terry's release.''   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, lives in Batavia, N.Y., in Rep.Slaughter's district.</TEXT></DOC>
