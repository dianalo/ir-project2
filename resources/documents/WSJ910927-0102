Her selection: a tap beer -- in this case Labatt's. Why?Because tap beer &quot;tastes fresher,&quot; she says.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Blackstock's choice is increasingly the choice ofrestaurant and tavern customers, much to the surprise anddelight of proprietors. From 1982 to 1989, sales of draft ortap beer -- beer poured from a keg -- declined steadily. Butin 1990, against all expectations, tap beer sales rose 2.7%,even as total on-premise beer sales fell.   Tap beer continues to outperform the market so far thisyear, despite the recession and an increase in federal excisetaxes. Draft sales declined a minuscule 0.5% through thefirst four months of 1991, while sales of canned and bottledbeers dropped 4.5%, says Michael Bellas, president ofBeverage Marketing Corp.   Some industry experts are at a loss to explain thereversal. In a world of stay-at-home couch potatoes andstiffer drunk-driving penalties, rising tap-beer sales wouldseem unlikely. &quot;If you pointed a gun at my head and made mecome up with a reason, I'd say some people are messing up thenumbers,&quot; says a beer company executive.   Still, almost everyone agrees it is happening. No censusis taken on the number of tap handles in the nation'srestaurants and bars, but anecdotal evidence indicates thatthe numbers are increasing. Because of consumer demand, ArtFessenden added three tap varieties this year at the CountyCork Pub, his Irish bar in Atlanta, bringing its tapofferings to 12. Jim Kelly, owner of Pat O'Shay's, a SanFrancisco sports bar, added 14 taps in the past year,including brands made by regional microbreweries such as RedHook and Sierra Nevada, bringing his total to 29.   Over the years, beer connoisseurs have regularly chosendraft beers over bottled ones. The beer, as Ms. Blackstocksays, is often fresher, because most domestic kegs are datedand pulled if not served within three months. And althoughfew taste buds are sensitive enough to tell the difference,some beer drinkers say that non-draft beers can tasteslightly &quot;cooked&quot; because they're pasteurized.   &quot;Americans are drinking less, but they're drinkingbetter,&quot; says Mr. Fessenden. He and the customers at his pubbelieve &quot;keg beer is in every instance better than bottledbeer,&quot; he says.   There are also economic incentives. Draft is generallycheaper than packaged beer at bars. Even imported andmicrobrewery beers often cost less on tap than domesticbottled beers, says Tim Newton, bar manager of Old Chicago, aBoulder, Colo., pizza shop.   For pub owners, moreover, &quot;there's more profit in draft,&quot;says Louie Hailson, manager of the Elephant Bar in Austin,Texas. Stripped of the heavy costs of bottling and marketing,keg beer generally costs the retailer less per serving, andthe markup to the consumer is greater.   Mr. Hailson makes about 17% to 18% more selling draftbeers than bottled or canned beers, which led him to offer 20different drafts and only a few bottled beers when he openedhis bar eight months ago. &quot;As margins begin to shrink,retailers become ultra-concerned with the bottom line,&quot; saysBob Monroe, director of national on-premise marketing forAdolph Coors Co.   But until recently, better taste and cheaper prices didn'ttranslate into growing sales for draft beer. A major reason,marketers say, is that in the 1980s, taste and price oftenmeant less than showing off a label that conveyed status.   Despite the apparent bewilderment of the beerestablishment, there are reasons for draft beer's comeback,including the success of recently introduced bottled draftbeers such as Miller Genuine Draft. Bottled draft, like tapbeer, isn't pasteurized. And while some beers, includingCoors products, never have been pasteurized, it took PhilipMorris Cos.' Miller Brewing unit to realize that the draftconcept could be used to market bottled beer. In just fouryears, Miller Genuine Draft has become one of the top 10beers in the U.S. Bud Dry Draft, only two years old, mayenter that tier in 1991.   &quot;Draft beer is being more widely publicized than it hasbeen since the 1930s,&quot; says Robert Weinberg, professor ofmarketing management at Washington University in St. Louis.Now, he says, &quot;people think if bottled draft is good, draftdraft must be better.&quot;   The Pearl Street Grill is selling more tap beer thanbottled beer. Owner Richard Director was having troubleselling bottles of a brew called Pete's Wicked Ale, but whenhe switched to a tap version in August, sales took off. &quot;Iwould think those beers not available on tap would be at adisadvantage at this point,&quot; he says.   By adding more taps, bar owners also believe they arestimulating consumer interest in draft beers. &quot;Choices arealways good, whether you're talking about beer or anythingelse,&quot; says Larry Kneeskern, a recent draft convert. Mr.Kneeskern's recent discovery of Foster Light on tap, a newoffering at the Elephant Bar in downtown Austin, prompted himto switch from his old favorite, Bud Light.   The addition of popular microbrews has further broadeneddraft's appeal. Most beers at microbreweries and brewpubs(microbreweries with a restaurant and bar attached) aren'tavailable except in kegs, because their small operationscan't afford bottle and can lines. And while they aren'tstealing Americans away from their Buds and Coors in hugenumbers, these microbrews may be teaching new habits.   &quot;Americans had forgotten to drink draft,&quot; says Mr.Weinberg. &quot;Then someone discovers a brewpub, has a draft,remembers how good it tastes, so now they're thinking aboutdraft.&quot;   The draft boom has helped imported beers, too. Sales ofimported drafts rose 6.3% last year, even more than draftsales overall. Sales of Guinness Stout, Bass Ale and HarpLager in the U.S. rose 13%, 12% and 15% respectively in 1990from 1989, says Don Blaustein, vice president, marketing, atGuinness Import Co., which distributes all three. The beersare available in the U.S. only on tap.   Some brewers, particularly importers, have started topursue draft accounts in restaurants more aggressively as away to introduce their beers to consumers and pump up storesales. Warsteiner Importers Agency uses draft sales athigh-end establishments instead of advertising to introduceits beer. Sales of Warsteiner, a German import, rose 28% inthe 1991 first half from a year earlier, says Diane Fall,president of Warsteiner Importers.   In the future, brewers are counting on a lift from a lesstraditional source to keep the draft craze rolling: concernabout the environment. Bars serving draft beers help theenvironment because they reduce can and bottle waste, saysMr. Monroe of Coors. That trend &quot;is in its infancy,&quot; he adds,&quot;but it will have an impact on our business in the future.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
