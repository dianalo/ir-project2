The situation is rare since corporate profits are such anintegral part of the broader economy. But the evidence isoverwhelming: While third-quarter gross national product rose 2.5percent, corporate profits fell.   Much of the decline was due to a non-recurring event _ moneyassigned by five big banks to cover anticipated losses on ThirdWorld loans _ but even without these losses corporate profits ingeneral were off.   While totals are not complete, profits for the companies makingup the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 22 percent to $4.98 ashare from $6.38 a share in the third quarter of 1988. Excludingthe banks the decline was 7 percent.   A survey by the Wall Street Journal showed a 21 percent drop inafter-tax earnings on continuing operations, and another byBusiness Week indicated a 22 percent drop, with both declinesnegatively influenced by bank performance.   Several industries performed much worse. Within the Sandamp;P, 13 of25 industry groups fell from their year-ago levels, compared witheight in the second quarter and just five in the first three monthsof the year.   In addition to the financial sector, other big declines occurredin the automotive group, aerospace, printing and publishing.   Reviewing the numbers, Wright Investor's Service said it isunlikely to see a fourth-quarter repeat of big bank write-offs,``but you never know.'' It said ``unusual charges and writeoffshave increasingly become a regular feature of fourth-quarterearnings reports.''   While a sluggish though still expanding economy has much to dowith the declines, intense competition is playing a large role,typified by a 16 percent drop in Sears' profits after it slashedprices in an effort to boost sales.   Intense competition also marks the computer, fast-food and autoindustries, with the latter attempting to raise prices only to beforced into renewed discounting. The auto group showed a 29 percentyear-to-year earnings decline.   While a decline of that magnitude is considered unusually sharp,Wright points out that it could have been much worse, around 46percent, if Chrysler Corp. hadn't gained $300 million from the saleof Mitsubishi Motors stock.   Many economists believe that the decline will level off nextyear, but none can provide convincing assurance. The unusual event,such as the billion-dollar accident involving Exxon Corp. thisyear, seems to have become less so.   Moreover, while most forecasts for 1990 suggest the economy willcontinue to lumber along on the positive side of arecession-expansion line, global competition conceivably couldcontinue to erode profits.   Edward Yardeni, senior vice president of Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc., continues to believe that the economy will expandin 1990, accompanied by a trend to lower interest rates and amoderation of inflationary pressures.   ``The only big change for us is in the outlook for profits,'' hewrote this month. ``The economy is clearly experiencing a profitsrecession,'' he said, attributing it to competition.   Looking on the brighter side of the situation, Yardeni said hehoped consumers would respond favorably to discounted prices andcut-rate financing. If not, ``then the profits recession couldbecome a growth recession as well.''   A growth recession is generally understood to mean an economythat manages to expand, but at such a meager rate that thedifference between growth and shrinkage is little more thanstatistical.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday, Nov. 30.</NOTE></DOC>
