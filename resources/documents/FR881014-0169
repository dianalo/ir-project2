For life insurance purposes, 5 CFR 870.302 isbeing revised to bring the FEGLI regulations into conformity with the CSRSand FERS provisions for determining rates of pay for employees who workless than fulltimeFor a regularly scheduled part-time employee, the annual basic pay ratewill be the basic pay applicable to the employee's tour of duty in a 52-weekwork year. However, the hours in a basic pay status are used if they arehigher than the tour of duty hours. For example, a part-time employee whowas being paid at the annual rate of $25,963 (or $12.44 per hour) but whosetour of duty was 20 hours a week, would have an annual rate of $12,938($12.44 per hour X 1040 hours). However, if the same employee actuallyearned basic pay during 1144 hours (averaging 22 hours per week) in the52-week work year, the annual rate of basic pay would be $14,231 ($12.44per hour X 1144 hours).To determine the annual rate of an intermittent employee, who does nothave a regularly scheduled tour of duty, the employee's hourly rate ofpay will be multiplied by the number of hours he or she worked at basicpay rates (up to full-time) in the 52-week work year immediately precedingthe end of the pay period. Intermittent employees do not have a regularlyscheduled tour of duty and normally work fewer hours than full-time employees.This method of looking back at the preceding 52-week period assures thatprovisions for determining rates of pay for employees who work less thanfull-time are the same for life insurance and retirement purposes. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because the regulations willonly affect Federal employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 870</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Life insurance.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM in amending Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 870_BASIC LIFE INSURANCE</ITAG>1.
