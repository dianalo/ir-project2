George M. Leonard, associate chief of the service, said heguessed the new policies would preserve about half the nation's oldgrowth stands _ more in some areas, less in others, depending onthe tree species involved in and other things.   ``Not all of the old growth is going to be preserved,'' he said.``My guess it's going to be substantially over half of theremaining old growth (that) will be preserved,'' he said.   The new policies will have the greatest impact on old-growthforests in the Pacific Northwest but will be applied to all forestsin the system, including eastern hardwoods and soft pines of theSouth.   The old-growth forests _ often never cut before, anddistinguished by old trees and accumulations of dead material _provide living space for many species of wildlife, including thecontroversial spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.   Congress recently approved compromise provisions aimed atprotecting the owl in $11.2 billion spending measure for theInterior Department and related agencies like the Forest Service,an arm of the Agriculture Department.   The legislation, designed to permit continued logging in theold-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, calls on the ForestService and Interior's Bureau of Land Management to ``minimizefragmentation of significant old-growth forest stand.'' No timbersales would be allowed in areas already identified as spotted owlhabitat.   Lawmakers sought a way to ensure Northwest mills of a steadysupply of timber from the region's old-growth forests while theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decides whether to declare thenorthern spotted owl an endangered species.   Such declarations require federal agencies to protect thehabitats of the species in question. The spotted owl lives almostexclusively in old-growth forests and each nesting air requires avery large area.   Leonard said the Forest Service will reduce the use oftraditional clear-cutting methods in which all or most trees in anarea are cut, and will increase retention of snags, dead-and-downmaterial and logging debris that could be used by wildlife.   Also some forest stands will be managed on ``extendedrotations'' to develop old-growth characteristics. Some of thoserotations would be for 150 to 200 years or longer.   Agency Chief F. Dale Robertson said in a statement that ``we donot anticipate an immediate impact on our timber sale program sinceour forest plans provide for many old-growth values.''   However, Robertson added that ``there will be an impact when wecomplete the final forest plans in California, Oregon andWashington, and as we amend or revise other forest plans due to agreater emphasis on old-growth values.''   Asked about wildlife species that might benefit from the newpolicy's use in eastern hardwood forests, Leonard said the redcockaded woodpecker in southern pine forests was one example but hewas not aware of any in old-growth hardwoods.   ``But certainly we're looking at the impact of cutting and theway we lay out our (timber) sales on bear habitat, on turkeyhabitat,'' he said.   Leonard said the recent years of controversy over old-growthforests, the spotted owl and other environmental factors have beenfierce and will take time to heal.   ``I've been involved in national forest management issues forover 30 years, and I've never found a situation that was morepolarized than the issue over the management of the PacificNorthwest,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
