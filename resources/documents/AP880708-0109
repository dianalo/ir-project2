The commander of the USS Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III,thought he was under attack by an Iranian F-14 when he fired twoSM-2 anti-aircraft missiles at Iran Air flight 655, an A300 Airbuswith 290 civilians aboard.   But the F-14 is primarily designed for combat against otheraircraft. And Pentagon sources said Iran hardly ever flies any ofits few operational F-14s in combat.   Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage said lastFebruary that it appeared Iran had begun increasing its use ofF-14s because of the plane's strong radar, and that one of themshot down an Iraqi Mirage over the the main Iranian oil terminal atKharg Island last Feb. 9.   ``This is the first effective use in combat we've seen inseveral months, as I remember,'' Armitage said then.   A U.S. military source with gulf experience said the Iranians,although using the F-14s more in recent months to monitor themovement of tankers carrying Iranian oil, seemed wary of sendingthem into combat. ``They have sent them up to escort tankers, andput them up when Iraqi fighters were around, but they always veeredoff and stayed out of danger,'' said the source, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   That raises yet another question in the mystery of why a $1billion Aegis cruiser, with the most sophisticated radar andtracking system in the Navy, mistook an Iranian A300 Airbus with290 civilians aboard for an F-14 and blasted it out of the sky at arange of nine miles.   To be effective against a ship as large as the Vincennes, 567feet long and displacing 9,600 tons when fully loaded, the F-14would need to be equipped with armaments that it does notordinarily carry, such as anti-ship missiles or bombs.   Or, said one air industry source, ``if somebody loaded thatsucker with 30,000 pounds of fuel, it would make one hell of a bombon a kamikaze run.''   The commander of U.S. forces in the region, Marine Corps Gen.George B. Crist, told reporters last Thursday that Iran recentlymoved an unspecified number of F-14s from their main base atIsfahan, central Iran, to Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf.   Iran Air flight 655 took off from the joint civilian-militaryfield at Bandar Abbas while Iranian Boghammar gunboats wereattacking the Vincennes in the Strait of Hormuz, and headed for theU.S. warship.   The airliner broadcast an identification signal similar to oneused by Iranian F-14s, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.   ``I don't think it is related to us ...,'' said Crist. ``I thinkthis has to do with reaction to the Iraqis'' attacking tankers inthe southern gulf, and ``not so much the Americans.''   But the development clearly worried U.S. skipper in the gulf.   Asked why the Vincennes was afraid of a plane that had neverbeen used against a surface target, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howardsaid: ``We do know that the Iranians have Harpoon (anti-shipmissiles) in their inventory which they can sling under an F-14with no difficulty.   ``We have suspected for some time that they have been workingwith Standards in an air-to-ground or air-to-surface mode. And theiron bomb is another possibility. So, if your question is, `Does anIranian F-14 constitute a threat to U.S. naval vessels?' the answeris, `Yes.'''   The chaiman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe,told a news conference Sunday that ``we have alerted our forces ofindications that Iranian units might carry out attacks against ourforces over the July Fourth period.''   Before the fall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iranacquired about 80 of the F-14s from the Grumman Corp. of LongIsland, New York.   Hundreds of American technicans were stationed at Isfahan,maintaining the F-14s and teaching the Iranians to fly them.   After the revolution, U.S. arms shipments were cut off, and Iranmore or less grounded its F-14s once its war with Iraq began inSeptember 1980.   Only within the past year has Iran managed to get the spareparts it needs to make as many as 15 of the F-14s operational,according to administration officials.   It is not clear where Iran is getting the parts, but U.S.intelligence reports that a North Korean ship docked at BandarAbbas at the end of June, and may have contained F-14 componentsand possibly weapons.   The F-14 can fly faster than Mach 2, twice the speed of sound,or about 1,320 mph at an altitude of 30,000 feet, and those in theU.S. Navy carry six Phoenix, four Sparrow and four Sidewinderanti-aircraft missiles and are armed with a 20mm Vulcan Mk-61cannon, capable of firing up to 6,000 rounds a minute.</TEXT></DOC>
