Each of the Applicants is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end,diversified, management investment company. In addition, BGIT, BEF, BVIT,BCTFT and BNTFT are series funds currently consisting of two, one, eight,three and three series, respectively (the ``Series''). Applicants requestthat the order sought hereby extend to any subsequently created Seriesof Applicants and any other investment company that might be subsequentlycreated, managed and distributed by BMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BenhamManagement International, Inc. Applicants will not avail themselves ofsuch relief except upon the terms and conditions set forth in the application.   2. The Money Market Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury debt securitiesguaranteed by the direct ``full faith and credit'' pledge of the U.S. Governmentand is designed as a cash reserve investment vehicle. Two of BVIT's Series,U.S. Government and High Quality Money Market Portfolio, invest primarilyin securities that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, itsagencies or instrumentalities, and other high quality securities. One Seriesof BCTFT, Money Market Portfolio, invests primarily in short-term (maturityof one year or less) California municipal securities. One Series of BNTFT,Money Market Portfolio, invests primarly in short-term (one year or less)municipal securities within or of a quality comparable to, the two highestrating classifications of either Standard andamp; Poor's Corporation or Moody'sInvestors Service.    3. Applicants may have cash reserves emanating from a variety of sources,including interest received on portfolio securities, unsettled or ``failed''securities transactions, cash arising from the liquidation of investmentsecurities to meet anticipated redemptions, and new monies received frominvestors. According to the application, BMC will be in the best positionto know at any given moment the cash reserves held by Applicants' to knowthe purpose and need for these reserves, and to make and implement decisionswith respect to the investment of these reserves. BMC could immediatelyinvest Applicants' uninvested monies into the Money Market Fund or MoneyMarket Portfolios while considering the purchase of appropriate portfoliosecurites for Applicants. If BGIT or BEF were required to invest cash balancesdirectly in U.S. Treasury debt securities rather than purchasing sharesof the Money Market Fund, or if each Series of BVIT, BCTFT and BNTFT, otherthan the Money Market Portfolios, were required to invest cash balancesdirectly in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or municipalsecurities, each Applicant is likely to be adversely affected by increasedtransaction costs and reduced and lost investment opportunities. The relativelyhigh transaction costs associated with making small investments in U.S.Treasury debt securities, and the frequent unavailability of such securitiesin small lots, often make it impractical to invest the small cash balancesthat Applicants often have.            4. The proposed transactions will comply with the limitations set forthin section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act and there will be no layering of salescharges, advisory fees or administrative expenses. BMC will receive noadditional advisory fee based on the proposed investments in the MoneyMarket Fund or Money Market Portfolios because such investments will beremoved from the base upon which the advisory fee for Applicants is calculated.Benham Financial Services, Inc. (``BFS''), the Applicants' administrativeservices company and transfer agent, will receive no additional administrativefee based on the proposed investments in the Money Market Fund or MoneyMarket Portfolios because such investments will be removed from the baseupon which the administrative fee for Applicants is calculated. Applicantsalso note that the Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfolios do notimpose a fee pursuant to Rule 12b-1 plans.5. Applicants assert that because Applicants retain the freedom to investcash assets directly in U.S. Treasury debt securities, other securitiesissued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, or municipal securities, thereexists an independent check upon the investment of Applicants' assets inan investment which produces a noncompetitive rate of return. The MoneyMarket Fund and Money Market Portfolios reserve the right to discontinueselling shares to Applicants if such sales adversely affect the portfoliomanagement and operations of the Money Market Fund or Money Market Portfolios.In order to assure that the control of the Money Market Fund or Money MarketPortfolios will not lead to any abuse, Applicants will vote their sharesin the Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfolios in the same proportionas the vote of all other shareholders in the Money Market Fund and MoneyMarket Portfolios.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Analysis</ITAG>1. Applicants request an order pursuant to sections 6(c), 17(b) and 17(d)of the 1940 Act, and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, to permit BGIT and BEF to purchaseshares of the Money Market Fund; the non-money market Series of BVIT, BCTFT,and BTNT to purchase shares of each Applicant's respective Money MarketPortfolios; and to permit BMC to effect the purchases and sales of sharesof the Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfolios by Applicants. Sincethe Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfolios may be deemed affiliatedpersons of each of the other Applicants as defined in section 2(a)(3) ofthe 1940 Act, the issuance by the Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfoliosof their shares to BGIT, BEF, and the Series of BVIT, BCTFT, and BNTFT,respectively, may be deemed a violation of section 17(a)(1) of the 1940Act. Conversely, the purchase of shares in the Money Market Fund and MoneyMarket Portfolios by Applicants may be deemed a violation of section 17(a)(2).Finally, the contemplated transactions may be deemed to involve a jointarrangement requiring prior SEC approval under Rule 17d-1.2. The proposed transactions satisfy the section 17(b) standard for exemptionfrom section 17(a). The consideration paid and received for the sale andredemptions of shares of the Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfoliosis their net asset value and therefore is reasonable and does not involveoverreaching on the part of Applicants. BMC will waive its advisory feeon that portion of Applicants' assets invested in the Money Market Fundand Money Market Portfolios. The transactions will be effected in accordanceeach Applicant's investment restrictions and will be consistent with thepurposes of the 1940 Act.3. Applicants' proposal provides no basis on which to predict that anyApplicant, or series thereof, would receive greater benefits than another.Applicants will participate in the proposal on the same basis, and thus,none will participate in a transaction on a basis ``different or less advantageous''than that of other participants. Although BMC may experience nominal costsavings and administrative convenience, the most significant benefit isthe elimination of the need to invest relatively small sums of money incash instruments. Finally, no ``conflict of interest'' exists between oramong Applicants, and no inherent bias exists to favor one Applicant overanother.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions</ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:1. The Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfolios will calculate theirrespective net asset values in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940Act.2.

Applicants will comply with the requirements of Section 12(d) of the1940 Act with respect to purchases of shares of the Money Market Fund andMoney Market Portfolios under the order requested herein.4. BFS will waive all administrative fees payable under its contracts withApplicants to the extent attributable to the net assets of the Money MarketFund and Money Market Portfolios held by them under the proposed investmentpolicy.5. BMC will waive all investment advisory fees payable under its contractswith Applicants to the extent attributable to the net assets of the MoneyMarket Fund and Money Market Portfolios held by them under the proposedinvestment policy.6. Applicants will vote their number of Money Market Fund and Money MarketPortfolios shares in the same proportion as the votes of all other shareholdersin the Money Market Fund and Money Market Portfolios.7. The acquiring funds will purchase and redeem shares of the Money MarketFund, and BVIT, BCTFT, and BNTFT will purchase and redeem shares of theirrespective Money Market Portfolios, as of the same time and at the sameprice, and will receive dividends and bear their proportionate share ofexpenses on the same basis as other shareholders of the Money Market Fundand Money Market Portfolios. A separate account will be established inthe shareholder records of the Money Market Fund for each acquiring fund,and in the shareholder records of the respective Money Market Portfoliosfor BVIT, BCTFT and BNTFT.8.
