The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>U.S. West Information Systems, 3/11/88, KFA-016</T3>U.S. West Information Systems filed an Appeal from a partial denial bythe Freedom of Information Officer of the Idaho Operations Office of aRequest for Information Act. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found thatan adequate search had been made and that the documents sought do not exist.<ITAG tagnum="84">Petition for Special Redress</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Texas, 3/7/88, KEG-0036</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning a Petition for Special Redresssubmitted by the State of Texas. The State sought permission to use StripperWell monies for a project which the DOE's Assistant Secretary for Conservationand Renewable Energy had held to be inconsistent with the terms of theStripper Well Settlement Agreement. The DOE disapproved Texas' proposalto use 3.9 million to conduct research supporting Texas' bid to have theSuper Conducting Supercollider (SSC) located in Texas. In reaching thisdetermination, the DOE found that Texas should not be permitted to useStripper Well funds for SSC site research, because site research wouldnot yield energy-related benefits for injured Texans, and because Stripperwell funds should not be used for advocacy purposes. Accordingly, Texas'Petition for Special Redress was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Motion for discovery</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>LaJet, Inc., et al., Economic Regulatory Administration, 3/10/88, KRD-0470,KRD-0471</T3>LaJet, Inc. (LaJet), LaJet Petroleum Company (LPC) and Texas Napco, Inc.(Texas Napco) filed a Motion for Discovery in connection with their Statementof Objections to the Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) which the Economic RegulatoryAdministration (ERA) issued to them on January 22, 1987. The DOE deniedthe respondents' request for information contained in OHA proceedings involvingKern County Refinery, Inc., based on the fact that the requested materialhad not been shown to be relevant. The DOE also denied the respondentsaccess to documents pertaining to an affidavit of Neal Myers, Presidentof Mellon Energy Products Company, which was used by the ERA to supportthe findings made in the PRO. The DOE found that the respondents had notdemonstrated that there was a compelling need to probe the deliberativeprocesses of agency officials involved in the preparation of the affidavit.The DOE rejected as unnecessary the respondents request for additionalmaterials explaining the PRO's calculations of overcharges. The respondents'requests for contemporaneous construction discovery of 10 CFR 211.67 (e)and (d), and andSection; 205.202 were denied on the grounds that they hadnot demonstrated that these regulations were so ambiguous that this discoverywas relevant and necessary. Accordingly, respondents' Motion for Discoverywas denied.The DOE also denied a Motion for Discovery submitted by the ERA. If foundthat the ERA had already established by a preponderance of the evidencethat LPC continued LaJet's refining business. It therefore concluded thatit was not necessary to grant the ERA discovery on this issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Application </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Apco Oil Corp./Two States Petroleum Co., Inc., 3/10/88, RF83-131 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Two States Petroleum Company, Inc.
