The committee said the Agriculture Department shouldproceed with its so-called streamlined inspection system, orSIS, but only after revamping it. At the same time, thecommittee emphasized that much more fundamental changes inmeat inspection are needed to protect consumers from suchhealth hazards as salmonella, campylobacter and otherbacteria as well as chemical residues.</LP><TEXT>   In a bluntly worded critique, issued yesterday, the panelsaid that the SIS plan isn't &quot;designed to detect andeliminate microbial or chemical hazards.&quot; The department'sFood Safety and Inspection Service was urged, among otherthings, to develop speedy methods for testing beef before itis shipped and to establish mandatory finished-productstandards.   Streamlined inspection, proposed for the beef industry's80 largest packing plants, would be the first major change inbovine meat inspection since the government began inspectingcattle in 1906. Under the plan, plant quality-controlemployees would take greater responsibility for visiblecontamination, such as hair and mud, freeing federalinspectors to focus more on food safety, rather than quality.   The plan would allow meatpackers to operate productionlines faster, boosting productivity as much as 40%. Butconsumer advocates denounce streamlined inspection as&quot;deregulation in disguise&quot; and a threat to public health,while union officials see it as a move to drastically cut theforce of inspectors.   The committee, headed by Robert Kahrs, dean of theUniversity of Missouri's College of Veterinary Medicine, alsoexpressed misgivings about the SIS plan, which is beingtested at several pilot plants.   &quot;From a food safety viewpoint,&quot; the panel said,&quot;SIS-Cattle alone is probably no better and, in somesituations, can be less effective than traditional inspectionbecause the reduced oversight by government inspectors isn'tcompensated by a total commitment to product quality on thepart of the industry.&quot;   The panel cautioned that streamlined inspection should beinaugurated only at plants where managers and employees havedemonstrated a commitment to effective quality control. Inrecent months, several federal inspectors at SIS test plantshave reported serious lapses in food safety.   &quot;The academy's report is a gratifying vindication of what50 whistle-blowers stated in sworn affidavits: In its presentform, SIS weakens the USDA seal of approval,&quot; said ThomasDevine, attorney for the Government Accountability Project, aWashington-based defense group for meat inspectors and otherwhistle-blowers.   The committee also faulted the Agriculture Department forfailing to heed key recommendations from two other academypanels, which studied meat inspection and other food safetyissues in 1985 and 1987. For one thing, the department hasn'tyet developed a method for tracing contamination in beefproducts back to specific feedlots or farms shipping taintedlivestock, the panel said. For another, the department hasn'tyet done any risk assessment.   &quot;There is no evidence that SIS-Cattle confers greaterbenefit to the public health than traditional inspection,&quot;the panel asserted.</TEXT></DOC>
