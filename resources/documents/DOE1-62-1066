<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-1066 </DOCNO><TEXT>A one-space-dimensional, time-dependent model for travelling combustionwaves in a porous medium is analysed. The key variables are the temperatureof the solid medium and its density and the temperature of the gaseousphase and its density. The key parameters {mu}, {lambda} and {alpha}are related (respectively) to the driving gas velocity, the specificheat of the combustible solid and the ratio of consumption of oxygento that of solid. The regions of existence of the different types ofcombustion waves are found in ({mu},{lambda}) parameter space, with {alpha}= 0. The types of combustion wave are classified by the switch mechanismthat turns off the combustion, which occurs over a finite, but unknown,interval. Because the model is linear outside the combustion zone, theeigenvalue problem governing the existence of travelling waves may bereformulated as a two-point free boundary problem on a finite domain.Existence and nonexistence theorems are established for this unusualbifurcation problem.</TEXT></DOC>
