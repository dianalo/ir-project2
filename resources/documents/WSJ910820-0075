The roller coaster began during overnight trading in Japanand London where prices of U.S. Treasury bonds soared. But bythe end of the U.S. session, bond prices were mixed withlong-term bonds posting modest declines and short-term billsand notes posting moderate advances.</LP><TEXT>   The news coming out of the Soviet Union prompted many bondtraders to rush to their offices as early as midnight Sundayto take customer orders and to protect their own holdings.During volatile periods, it isn't uncommon for a trader inNew York or Chicago to deal with counterparts in Japan andLondon while waiting for business to open in New York.   Buying during the early morning hours was intense. &quot;We hadthe overseas markets getting crushed. That lead tospeculation that money was looking for a safe haven home inthe U.S.,&quot; said Steven R. Ricchiuto, financial economist atBarclays De Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. As prices of Germanand Japanese bonds plunged, U.S. Treasurys soared.   The &quot;flight-to-quality&quot; rally in U.S. Treasurys causedyields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond to dip brieflyto 7.92%, the lowest level in several years. Treasury billrates slipped under 5%.   &quot;I would best describe {what happened} as panic buying,&quot;said Michael Moore, trading manager at Continental Bank.Political upheavel often triggers &quot;flight-to-quality&quot;rallies, so-called because during such events investors sellstocks and other riskier securities and pour money into U.S.Treasury securities, considered the safest securities in theworld.   But the flight-to-quality buying activity during the U.S.session was not as strong as expected. Also, stock prices inthe U.S. did not fall as much as some bond traders hadexpected, suggesting that U.S. investors were not sellingstocks to invest in bonds.   &quot;Once you saw some stability in the stock market, then theflight to quality subsided,&quot; said John Costas, governmenttrading manager at First Boston Corp. Mr. Costas says thatmost retail customer activity dried up by noon EDT.   As a result, the market reversed direction and bond pricesended mixed. The Treasury's latest 30-year bond, the market'sbellwether security, ended 1/4 point lower, a loss of $2.50for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield,which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to8.11% from 8.08% on Friday.   But short-term bills and notes managed to hold on to someof their gains and ended moderately higher.   Today, the Federal Reserve's policymaking Federal OpenMarket Committee meets in Washington, D.C., and some analystssay it will decide to cut rates soon.   &quot;I think we could see a policy move out of them,&quot; saidRobert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.International, who looks for the Fed to cut the discount rateto 5% from 5.5%. The discount rate is what the Fed chargesmember banks for loans.   The Fed &quot;can't think the Soviet situation is good forconfidence&quot; in the economy, said Mr. Brusca. &quot;It raises evenmore risks for the economy.&quot;                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Prices ended mixed in hectic trading. The Treasury'sbenchmark 30-year bond ended lower at a price of 100 2/32 toyield 8.11%, compared with 100 11/32 to yield 8.08% Friday.   But Treasurys with maturities of four years or less endedhigher. The latest three-year notes, for example, ended at100 21/32 to yield 6.61%, up from 100 16/32 to yield 6.66%.   The decline in yields brought sharply lower interest ratesat the Treasury's weekly three-month and six-month bill sale.   The Treasury sold $10.4 billion of three-month bills at anaverage discount rate of 5.17% and sold $10.4 billion ofsix-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.23%.   The 5.17% rate on the three-month bill was the lowestsince Oct. 26, 1987, the week after the stock market crash,while the 5.23% rate on the six-month bill was the lowestsince Oct. 27, 1986. At last week's bill sale, thethree-month and six-month bills brought average rates of5.30% and 5.39%, respectively.   In early trading yesterday, the yield on three-month billsfell as low as 4.89% but recovered before the bill auction.Here are details of yesterday's bill auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it.   The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year,while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                          13-Week        26-Week Applications ............. $29,124,050,000 $32,545,805,000 Accepted bids ............ $10,417,080,000 $10,400,915,000 Accepted at low price ....             83%             16% Accepted noncompet'ly ....  $1,585,595,000  $1,248,235,000 Average price (Rate)......  98.693 (5.17%)  97.356 (5.23%) High price (Rate).........  98.706 (5.12%)  97.361 (5.22%) Low price (Rate)..........  98.691 (5.18%)  97.351 (5.24%) Coupon equivalent.........          5.33%           5.46% CUSIP number .............      912794WW0        912794YA6                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Aug. 22, 1991. The 13-week billsmature Nov. 21, 1991, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 20,1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Junk bonds, which initially fell like a rock on news ofthe coup in the Soviet Union, rebounded strongly, ending theday with only modest losses.   Most high-risk, high-yield bonds ended between 3/8 and 1/2point lower. The junk bond market had slumped as much as 11/2 points earlier.   David Feinman, a junk bond trader at Los Angeles-basedJefferies andamp; Co., said that while equity markets in the U.S.and in London each lost 2% to 3% of their value, the junkbond market only registered a decline of 0.5%.   &quot;It appears that investors feel the junk market will bemore stable than the equity markets around the world ifsignificant dislocation occurs in the Soviet Union,&quot; said Mr.Feinman.   Junk bonds of Amphenol Corp. registered spectacular gainsdespite the cloud that hung over the market. Amphenol'szero-coupon bonds shot up by five to 10 points, to bid pricesranging from 75 to 80, after the company said it filed withthe Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial publicoffering of 12 million class A common shares.   Amphenol, which designs and makes electrical, electronicand fiber optic connectors, said net proceeds from theoffering will be used to reduce debt.   In the secondary market for investment-grade corporatebonds, prices fell 1/8 to 1/4 point on average.   Bonds of Salomon Inc. were stable even though the TreasuryDepartment has suspended the firm's securities subsidiaryfrom placing orders for clients in government securitiesauctions.   Salomon's 8% notes maturing in 1996 were bid for at ayield of 9.68%, little changed from Friday. The notes werequoted at a spread of 2.40 percentage points above thecomparable Treasury.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bond prices finished narrowly mixed, with prices1/8 point higher to about 1/8 point lower.   Among seasoned issues, the Municipality of MetropolitanSeattle's 6.875% securities of 2031 finished 1/8 point higherat 97 5/8 to yield 7.01%.   In primary activity, an offering of $423 million of NewJersey Turnpike Authority revenue bonds was fairly wellreceived, although some institutional investors avoided theterm bonds maturing in 2014 because of an unfavorable callfeature.   Still, underwriters led by First Boston Corp. were able toreprice a portion of the offering, lowering yields by 0.02 to0.05 percentage point from the initial pricing.   The bonds, rated single-A by Moody's Investors ServiceInc., Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors ServiceInc., were repriced to yield from 5.30% in 1994 to 6.94% in2014.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage securities ended lower.   In secondary trading, Government National MortgageAssociation 9% securities for September delivery were at 10119/32, down 7/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association9% securities were at 101 4/32, down 6/32.   Weighing on the market were continued rumors that SalomonInc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. unit may hold a huge arbitrageposition in which the firm is long on mortgage issues andshort on intermediate Treasurys. (A long position is a betthat prices of a particular security will rise, and a shortposition is a bet that they will fall.) Market talk is thatSalomon could be long as much as $5 billion to $10 billion ofmortgages and short a comparable amount of Treasurys. ASalomon spokesman declined to comment.   Spread trades involving mortgages and Treasurys arepopular with major Wall Street dealers. Salomon was rumoredto have been a seller of mortgage securities Thursday,contributing to the mortgage market weakness that session.And if the firm does still hold a big arbitrage position, itmay seek to unwind some of that position, dealers speculate.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          The upheaval in the Soviet Union slammed the door on newEurobond deals.   There were about a dozen Eurobond offerings planned forlaunch this week and many more scheduled for September. Butinvestment bankers and traders now say that the chances ofthose deals being launched in the near future is remote.   &quot;No one is even thinking of Eurobonds,&quot; said a syndicatemanager at a U.S. securities firm. &quot;You would be crazy to.&quot;   Investment bankers and traders say the uncertainty causedby the Soviet crisis will cast a shadow over the Eurobondmarket for weeks or months. Although some European investorsdumped stocks and bought bonds yesterday, government bondmarkets are likely to remain the fixed-income investment ofchoice.   &quot;Investors aren't going to be easily persuaded to buyanything but government paper,&quot; a head trader says.&quot;Typically, when there is such volatility, the Eurobondmarket suffers.&quot;   One of the most popular deals this week was to have beenJapan Development Bank's 100 billion yen ($727.8 million) of10-year notes. The offering by the government-guaranteedborrower was expected to be oversubscribed.   But an official with the bank said yesterday that theoffering won't be launched unless the market stabilizes. Theofficial said the bank hoped to achieve a final funding costof 6.7% after swapping into floating-rate funds, but he saidthis couldn't be attained currently. The issue had beenexpected to yield less than the World Bank's benchmark10-year bonds that were yielding 6.57% Friday. The yield onthe World Bank bonds now stands at 6.69%.   Other deals on the calendar for launch this week includeMitsubishi Estate Co.'s $200 million 10-year Eurobonds andMori Seki Co.'s $150 million of equity-linked bonds.   Looking further ahead, a string of issues from top-rateborrowers is scheduled for September to coincide with the endof the summer holidays. Borrowers such as the EuropeanInvestment Bank, the kingdom of Spain, the World Bank and theEuropean Community have all been expected to kick off theautumn season of financing in about 10 days.   Other borrowers, such as the European Bank forReconstruction and Development, had been planning debutofferings. National Bank of Hungary had been scheduled tolaunch a 250 million European currency units ($292.6 million)issue, while Latin American borrowers such as Argentina andBrazilian state oil concern Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. wereexpected with U.S. dollar deals.   &quot;There were quite a few deals lined up,&quot; a syndicatemanager at a French bank said. &quot;That's all pretty uncertainnow.&quot;   In trading yesterday, prices of most foreign bondsplunged. In Japan, the benchmark 10-year issue, the No. 1296.4% coupon due in 2000, fell nearly one point to 99.06. Theyield rose 0.17 percentage point to 6.57%.   German bonds, which tumbled as much as 1 1/2 points earlyin the session, staged a modest recovery but still endedsharply lower.   The benchmark German Unity Fund 10-year 8.75% bond due in2001 fell 1.30 to 100.73 to yield 8.64%. Among shortermaturities, the 8.625% government notes due in 1996 fell 0.41point to 98.85 to yield 8.92%.   British government bonds ended mixed, with prices of longmaturities modestly weaker and short-term securities mostlyhigher.</TEXT></DOC>
