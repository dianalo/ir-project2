The worldwide demand of HDPE has increased annuallyby 5% in 1985 from 7.2 million tons, by 11% in 1986 and 7% in 1987. Thedemand increase in these three years was 24% or 1.72 million tons whichcorresponds to approximately three-times the annual demand in Japan.The balance of supply and demand rapidly changed from the excess of 250,000tons in 1985 and 140,000 tons in 1986 to 50,000 tons in 1987. The mainfactors determining the increase of worldwide demand in 1992 are thetrend of crude oil price, the world economy including that of the U.S.and the tendency of the consumption of HDPE in China. The factors largelyaffecting the demand of HDPE in Japan are the supply and demand of HDPEin China, the exportation of HDPE products from Korea, Taiwan and Thailand,and the demand of HDPE in the U.S., Europe and Brazil.
