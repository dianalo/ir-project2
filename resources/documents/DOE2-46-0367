Especially the propagation of the gas coolingshould be highly located in the town gas demand and the political significanceand promoting measures for gas cooling demand were described to evaluatefrom points on the leveling of the gas demand load and on the energypolicy to alternate oil. The alleviating actions for installing costand charge are adopted to propagate the gas cooling. The gas coolingis the potential field to develop hereafter, corresponding to the diversificationof public needs and the demand will be expanded by the propagation ofsmall type gas engine heat pump, expansion of the area wide air conditioningand the trend of the cogeneration.
