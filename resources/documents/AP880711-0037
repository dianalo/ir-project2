Thunderstorms in North Carolina and Michigan on Sunday broughtdamaging high winds and led to injuries, including six people hitby lightning in Michigan and a North Carolina woman who washospitalized after a power surge went through her electric curlingiron.   But in Wisconsin, crop rejuvenation came almost overnight.   ``It (the corn) looks nice and green right now, it's unfolded.It's probably grown two inches since this morning,'' Wisconsinfarmer Vince Garvoille said Sunday while examining three-quartersof an inch in his rain gauge. He said his hay probably grew threeinches in the 10 hours after the weekend rain.   ``It just popped out of the ground,'' Garvoille said. ``It'samazing what water can do.''   In Kentucky and Illinois there remained mostly only promises.Georgia was still hot and dry, with a half inch of rain only in onearea.   In Iowa, rain in some areas reached five inches.   A cold front pushed thunderstorms into southern Illinois today.The National Weather Service predicted scattered thundershowersthrough Tuesday, but the amount of rainfall was expected to be lessthan half an inch.   ``Illinois needs more rain than you can imagine to end thedrought,'' said Carl Williams, of the Chicago weather serviceoffice.   Williams said a ``whiz-bang'' thunderstorm dropped only a traceof rain at O'Hare International Airport Sunday afternoon, with alittle more falling on downtown Chicago.   ``It wasn't enough to settle the dust but it was better thannothing,'' he said.   Storms moved out of Iowa on Sunday night, but the weatherservice said showers and thunderstorms were possible tonightthrough Wednesday in parts of the state.   Five inches of rain fell in parts of Iowa, while other areas gotless than a half-inch from storms late Friday through the weekend,``still leaving the crops in a tenuous situation,'' said S. ElwynnTaylor, a climatologist at Iowa State University.   ``The state as a whole requires four inches of precipitation tobreak the drought,'' he said.   At Logan, Iowa, farmer Ivan Leonard said he got a little morethan five inches over two days.   ``This is going to be a big boost to the bean crop,'' he said,adding that it will help salvage some of his corn crop as well.   A blanket of stagnant air scattered thunderstorms and lightningacross North Carolina, and heavy rains caused some flooding.   A 20-year-old Transylvania County woman was injured Sunday whenlightning apparently struck her house and power surged through acurling iron she was using.   The woman, who was not identified by Transylvania CountyHospital personnel, was in satisfactory condition this morningsuffering from electrical shock, they said.   The high winds felled trees, knocking out power to about 2,500customers in the county.   Areas of Michigan got up to an inch of rain, but with it camehigh winds and lightning that injured at least six and cut power to31,000 residents, officials said.   But for most of Michigan, the rain brought relief.   ``When it started downpouring, I was smiling. I was whistling,''said John Nink, 29, who measured a half inch of rain in hisTraverse City cherry orchard.   Storms dumped up to 1{ inches of rain on Ohio, but it was farshort of what weather officials say is needed to end the drought.   Hot, dry weather continued across Georgia except in Valdosta,which reported more than a half inch of rain Sunday.   Despite the drought, the Georgia Department of Agriculturereported that the Georgia peach harvest could be the best in fouryears because of irrigation.   A cold front that has the potential for triggering showers washeaded for Kentucky, but can't be counted on for major droughtrelief.   ``The system is still coming down this way,'' said MarilynScholz, of the weather service in Louisville. ``As far as how muchrain, that's a good question. It still probably won't be as much aswe need.''   Weekend rainfall of up to a three-quarters of an inch dropped onparts of Kentucky.   In Georgia, where 2,500 Army National Guardsmen are gettingready for two weeks of training, officials said they will takespecial precautions at drought-parched Fort Stewart.   Sgt. 1st Class Jerry Allen, 39, of Cedartown, Ga., said the baseis the driest it's been in the 14 years he's attended summer camp.   ``It's going to be dusty and it's going to be dangerous,'' saidAllen, an M-1 tank crewman. ``All it takes is one flare or onespark to set the woods on fire.''</TEXT></DOC>
