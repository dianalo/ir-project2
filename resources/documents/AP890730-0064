U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh was to decide Mondaywhether the federal courts or a judge in Cincinnati should handleRose's lawsuit against baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.   For more than a month, Rose's legal actions have kept thecommissioner from deciding whether Rose bet on his own team _ anoffense that carries a possible lifetime ban. The question of whichcourt hears Rose's case is pivotal.   Baseball wants the case in federal court, where judgespreviously have upheld the sweeping powers of the commissioner.Rose wants it kept in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court, whereJudge Norbert A. Nadel has shown willingness to set precedents inhis decisions.   To keep the case in state court, Holschuh must rule that thedispute is between two entities that reside or do business in Ohio.That would involve one of two findings: that the case technicallyis between Rose and the Reds, an Ohio team; or that major leaguebaseball is an unincorporated association doing business in Ohiothrough the Reds, thus subject to lawsuit in Ohio courts.   However, if Holschuh decides the dispute technically is betweenRose and the commissioner of baseball, A. Bartlett Giamatti, wholives in another state, then the federal courts could have domain.   Rose has blocked Giamatti for more than a month from decidingwhether Rose bet on the Reds.   The manager also has received protections from firing by theteam or suspension by Giamatti while the case is heard. Theprotections extend for three days after Holschuh's decision.   While lawyers for Rose and Giamatti have exchanged voluminousand sometimes sharply worded legal arguments, the ballclub has kepta low profile.   The Reds filed papers with Holschuh saying they were maintaininga strict neutrality. Owner Marge Schott has declined to make publicstatements about the case while it is in court, but admits she'sunhappy it has dragged on so long.   And general manager Murray Cook says there's no thought beinggiven to asking the courts for authority to remove Rose if the caselasts beyond this season.   ``I don't know that we can,'' Cook said. ``We're not lawyers. Wejust have to go by what the lawyers dictate at this time.''</TEXT></DOC>
