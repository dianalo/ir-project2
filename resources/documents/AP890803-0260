Members of Congress who oversee banking agencies criticized themove Wednesday, but said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may nothave had a choice.   The bank board ruled that Home Federal Savings and LoanAssociation of San Diego, the eighth largest Sandamp;L in the nation,could leave the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   The move comes as the House prepares to pass a massive bailoutof the Sandamp;L industry.   The legislation, in response to the worst financial crisis sincethe Depression, would pump an immediate $50 billion into governmentdeposit insurance funds depleted by hundreds of Sandamp;L failures due topoor and often fraudulent loans.   It also would institute a major overhaul of the government'sregulation of the nation's nearly 3,000 thrifts and require theirowners to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk.   Home Federal is only one of several big Sandamp;Ls trying to escapeFSLIC and join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the commercialbank fund that charges its members less for the same federalinsurance of $100,000 per account.   But a bank board attorney said the Home Federal decision, whichmust be ratified by the FDIC and by state regulators in a processexpected to take at least several months, doesn't set a precedentmaking it easier for other institutions to flee.   Nevertheless, the ruling is generating criticism in Congress.   As part of the price for the bailout, Sandamp;Ls will continue to payhigher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years, evenif they convert to a bank.   Home Federal is hoping to escape the higher premiums under aprovision of a 2-year-old bill that permits institutions to leaveprovided they applied before March 31, 1987. Home Federal filed itsapplications a day before the deadline.   ``The net result will be the taxpayer cost will be driven up andthat's not something I support,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, amember of the House Banking Committee.   But, she added, ``in fairness to this particular institution,''it meets the test for a special exception established in 1987.   It is unclear, however, if the loophole will still be good ifHome Federal, as expected, is unable to complete its conversionbefore Congress enacts new Sandamp;L legislation, which has provisionsthat would supersede the 1987 law.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., also a banking committee member,said regulators may have had no choice but to rule in favor of HomeFederal.   ``I think it's awful,'' he said. ``It sends a terrible signal.... If there was a legal way to avoid the decision, it should havebeen done.''   John Buchman, a bank board staff attorney, said the Home Federaldecision, announced Tuesday, won't set a precedent favorable toHomes Savings of America and Great Western, two Los Angeles-basedSandamp;Ls also trying to leave the FSLIC.   The bank board denied an application from Great Western, thenation's second largest thrift, which in June lost an attempt tooverturn the decision in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. It isappealing.   The bank board has until October to rule on the application fromHome Savings of America, the nation's biggest Sandamp;L.   The bank board has allowed 13 other Sandamp;Ls to secede from theFSLIC under the 1987 law, all considerably smaller than HomeFederal.   Home Federal, which reported $17.2 billion in assets at the endof May, has about 200 branches throughout California. Last year, itpaid $13.7 million more in insurance premiums than it would have asa bank.   Both bank and Sandamp;L premiums would be raised under the Sandamp;L bill,but Home Federal would still pay about $9 million less in premiumsas a bank.</TEXT></DOC>
