IBM said Monday it is offering special payments to people whoquit or retire at four locations, a step that is expected to cut600 to 1,000 jobs.   The job cuts, which are voluntary, represent less than half of 1percent of IBM's U.S. work force of 223,000.   The four locations are Owego, N.Y., and Manassas, Va., where IBMmakes specialized equipment for defense contracts; Endicott, N.Y.,where it makes the 9370 line of minicomputers; and Lexington, Ky.,where it makes typewriters and printers.   Most of the people who will be offered the special payments arein administrative and support areas, IBM spokesman John Reillysaid. They will be given a bonus of one week's pay for each sixmonths they have worked for IBM, up to a maximum of one year's pay.   IBM spokesman Peter Thonis said the cost of the cuts would notsignificantly hurt the company's profits. He said the cuts were notrelated to a slowdown in sales of products made at the fourlocations.   Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Inc. announced Monday a plan toreduce its 105,000-employee work force by about 2,500 positions,primarily salaried jobs at its U.S. plants.   ``We've improved our normal voluntary severance package,'' saidMotorola spokesman Chuck Sengstock. ``Those applying who areaccepted will now receive two weeks' severance pay for each year ofservice.''   Sengstock said most of those being urged to take the severancepackage work in the electronics company's communications andsemiconductor products groups.   If not enough workers take the severance package, there may belayoffs, said Sengstock.   The company said a pretax provision of about $43 million tocover the cost of the severance program would be reflected inthird-quarter earnings to be announced next week.   Motorola President George Fisher said the program ``simplyreflects what we at Motorola consider to be good and prudentmanagement and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base.''He said the company was not predicting an earnings downturn.   The package will be offered to workers at selected Motorolafacilities until about mid-November, Sengstock said. He mentionedplants in Chicago; Phoenix; Austin, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; FortLauderdale, Fla.; and Boynton Beach, Fla., as among the facilitieswhere salaried employees would be encouraged to take severance.   Cray Research, one of the world's largest supercomputermanufacturers, announced Monday it is laying off 400 employees attwo Wisconsin plants.   The layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections andthe fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture today'ssupercomputer systems, the Minneapolis-based company said. Craysaid it has essentially completed the transition from the Cray X-MPsystem to the more advanced Cray Y-MP product line.   Cray has about 5,400 employees worldwide.   The company said all costs associated with the manufacturingwork force reduction would be incurred in 1989, and are expected tototal about $3 million.   Cray said it was eliminating 280 jobs at Chippewa Falls and 120at its Rice Lake plant.   The company offered full salary to the end of year for anyemployees who left voluntarily at the end of the month. Any layoffswill be based on seniority, Cray said.   Workers who lose their jobs would also get $4,000 in educationgrants, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
