LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government prosecutors questioned dozens ofstock brokerage officers and employees Tuesday in a probe into amultimillion dollar illegal trading scandal, an attorney general'soffice source said.   Four top officers from Mexico's two biggest brokerage firms werearrested Monday on fraud charges. The source, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said up to 150 more arrests may follow.   The investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200investors against all but one of Mexico's 24 registered brokeragefirms after stockholders lost about $7 million in the October 1987crash.   The alleged violations ranged from insider trading in both stocksand foreign currencies to the sale of nonexistent Treasurycertificates and trading in securities without the consent of theirclients.   Alfredo Harp Helu, president of the Mexican Stock Exchange, saidthe National Securities Commission had determined that the brokersand employees ``only could be given administrative sanctions becausenot one case of the activities (under investigation) can beconsidered criminal.''   Harp Helu said he did not know the identities of the brokersunder investigation or what charges they could face.   Roberto Hoyo D'Addona, the Treasury's general prosecutor, toldreporters Monday the department began receiving complaints of fraudafter the stock market index plunged 74 percent in 28 trading days.   He said Treasury agents also are investigating possible taxevasion.   Spokesmen for both the attorney general's office and the TreasuryDepartment, which is responsible for enforcing securities tradingand tax laws, declined to comment on Tuesday's interviews.   Among those arrested were Eduardo Legorreta, board chairman andone of the founders of Operadora de Bolsa, one of the Mexico's twoleading trading firms, and Jaime Ceballos Cervantes, the company'sdirector of investment promotions.   Legorreta, 44, is a member of one of Mexico's wealthiestfamilies. His arrest at a Mexico City restaurant Monday night shookthe country's business community.   Also arrested were Juan Carlos Fernandez Cuevo and Jose FranciscoRodriguez Dupont of Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones, the othermajor brokerage firm.   Gustavo Diaz, president of an association formed by the wrongedinvestors, has estimated the brokerage firms netted $43.5 million inprofits from the alleged illegal dealing.   Market prices started dropping at the close of business on thestock exchange Monday before the arrests, amid rumors of impendingaction by the government. The 52-stock price index dropped by alittle less than 1 percent as sales increased.   Tuesday opened with another spurt of sales, but at the close ofbusiness the market recovered and the 52-stock price index wasslightly up by 40 points to 211,841.   The Mexican securities and exchange commission announced it wasimplanting a series of regulations, effective immediately, toprevent future fraud.   In a statement, the commission said the new regulations includean automatic system to monitor daily trading and mandatory outsideauditing for all brokerage firms.</TEXT></DOC>
