DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Murphy's Law caught up with the Murphy bed whena federal appeals court ruled that the name of the famous fold-downbed is now so commonly used that it's no longer protected bytrademark laws.   ``We hold that `Murphy bed' is a generic term, having beenappropriated by the public to designate generally a type of bed,''the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Monday in overturningpart of a lower court ruling.   The 2nd Circuit ruled that a federal judge on Long Island erredin finding companies in Georgia and Florida _ both named Murphy BedCo. of America Inc. _ had infringed on the trademark rights of TheMurphy Door Bed Co., which was founded in 1925 by the inventor ofthe disappearing bed.   But like Murphy's Law, in which anything that can go wrong will,the appeals court also had some bad news for the Murphy bedimitators:   ``We agree with the district court that defendants engaged inunfair competition by passing off beds of their own manufacture asbeds of the Murphy Co.,'' which is based in Amittyville.   The court also affirmed U.S. District Judge Jacob Mishler'sinjunction, which bars the two companies from using the term``Murphy bed.''   At the turn of the century, William Lawrence Murphy invented abed that could be concealed in a wall closet when not in use. Hepatented the idea in 1918.   At least twice, Murphy successfully convinced imitators whomarketed their products as Murphy beds to use a different name.   But the appeals court noted that in 1981 and in 1982, thefederal Patent and Trademark Office refused the Murphy Co.'s bid toregister ``Murphy bed'' as a trademark, and a trademark appealsboard found in 1984 that ``Murphy bed has for a long period of timebeen used by a substantial segment of the public as a generic termfor a bed which folds into a wall or closet.''   While affirming the $6,330 in damages awarded The Murphy DoorBed Co. for breach of contract, the appeals court dismissed the$801,161 awarded in compensatory damages and sent the case back toMishler for a recalculation based on the Florida and Georgiacompanies' net profits.   Court papers did not specify in which cities the companies arebased.</TEXT></DOC>
