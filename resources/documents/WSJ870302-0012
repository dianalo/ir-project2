The groups are headed by E.H. Industries Canada Inc., a unit of European Helicopter Industries Ltd., London, and a partnership of Aerospatiale, a French government-owned aircraft maker, and Canadair Ltd., an aircraft maker owned by Bombardier Inc., Montreal.    European Helicopter is jointly owned by Westland Group Ltd. of Britain and Augusta S.p.A. of Italy. It has developed the EH-101 helicopter that has gone into production in Europe and is to be flying later this year. The Aerospatiale-Canadair bid involves a new naval version of Aerospatiale's Super Puma helicopter.    The Canadian armed forces said it will need at least 30 new helicopters to meet its requirements. The government had asked for bids to be submitted before the end of last month. </TEXT></DOC>
