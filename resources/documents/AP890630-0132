The commission, denying challenges by MCI Communications Corp.,US Sprint and others, said ATandamp;T's so-called Tariff 12 had not beenshown to be illegal or discriminatory.   The decision was seen as a major victory for ATandamp;T, battling toretain a share of the important market for custom-designed networksthat large companies use for internal communications.   The FCC orginally declared the plan illegal in an April 18 rulingbecause it was not equally available to all customers with similarneeds. But the commission suspended a two-year investigation andallowed ATandamp;T to continue offering the plan while giving the company30 days to revise it.   ATandamp;T filed a revision in May in the midst of a slew of challengesby competitors who said the tariff was a disguise for predatorypricing. ATandamp;T said in its revised offering that it wouldn't penalizecompanies that dropped the plan, also adding some services andchanging some rates.   Gerald Brock, FCC common carrier bureau chief, said Friday that``no compelling argument has been presented that the proposed tariffis so patently unlawful as to warrant rejection.''   He also said there was no evidence that further investigation waswarranted.   ``The controversy stems solely from competitors attempting toroll regulatory logs at ATandamp;T each time it wins what they have lostin fair, open competition,'' said ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen.   US Sprint spokeswoman Janis Langley said the FCC action wasfurther evidence ``of the illegality and unlawfulness of the FCCorder suspending the (Tariff 12) investigation and it's alsoevidence of the FCC's intention to rubber stamp all of the Tariff 12filings.''   Kathleen Keegan of MCI said her company was disappointed ``withthe FCC's failure to recognize Tariff 12 is a customer-specificvehicle for offering discriminatory rates on services that aregenerally available.''   ``We believe that the court appeal will affirm our view,'' shesaid.   FCC, MCI, Sprint and the Independent Data CommunicationsManufacturers Association filed suit against the April ruling in theU.S. Court of Appeals. That action is pending.   Tariff 12 first was used in 1985 to provide a service to theDefense Department and its 12 users, include General Electric, FordMotor Co. and E.I. DuPont de Nemours. Opponents said it was designedto disguise rate discounts, and that ATandamp;T was illegally selling theservice below cost.</TEXT></DOC>
