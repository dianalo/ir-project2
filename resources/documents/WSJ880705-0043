With employment generally expected to remain strong, inflation-minded economists are becoming more concerned with the wages earned than with the number of wage-earners.    &quot;If inflation is going to evolve into real trouble, it's going to be from wages,&quot; says Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. He and others say that's still a big &quot;if&quot; in this era of diminished blue-collar power and heightened corporate cost-cutting.    As Mr. Moran says, the Labor Department's index of hourly wages has posted two consecutive monthly increases. The latest, May's 0.5% jump, came despite a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 5.6%. Many economists expect the June rate to drop back to 5.5%.    With unemployment near its lowest rate in 14 years, many economists say wage pressure continues to build. &quot;Given the kind of labor market we have right now, one has to figure wage increases will continue,&quot; says Samuel Kahan, economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago.    Mr. Kahan, like many others, expects the June unemployment rate to be below 5.6%, indicating continued demand for workers in an economy that is still showing strength.    Because pay demands can be affected by higher food prices, the current drought in the Midwest and Southeast is adding fodder to the debate over wage-driven inflation. Last week, the Agriculture Department said farm prices rose 3.7% in June, with grains and soybeans higher and cattle prices lower. In May, farm prices rose 3.1%.    Concerns about inflation are valid, says Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. But while agricultural commodity prices are definitely on the upswing, oil prices -- the greatest inflation-maker in recent history -- aren't.    &quot;Were oil prices to participate, I would not be so sanguine,&quot; Mr. Smith says in a recent report. He says the gains in inflation might not be very large but are likely to stay around for a while. He expects inflation to remain in the 4% to 5% range beyond 1988.    Industrial commodity prices are another potential inflationary hot spot. With U.S. factories operating at more than 82% of capacity, many basic materials are rising in price as supply dwindles. Eventually, that sort of cost pressure shows up in higher prices for finished goods.    But increasingly, such traditional economic theory may be tested by a new breed of manager. &quot;The purchasing manager in most companies now has become a senior official. He's under the gun to hold down prices,&quot; says Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.    That might have been difficult in June, according to the latest business survey conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management. Its members cite a growing list of commodities, from aluminum to chemicals, that are in short supply. In all, the report lists more than 30 commodities or categories of materials that are rising in price. It doesn't list any items as declining in price.    In the long term, the inflationary trend will depend on the strength of the manufacturing sector. North American auto sales rebounded in mid-June, rising 11.9% from a year earlier for an annual rate of 7,580,000. But many analysts expect the full June tally, due out tomorrow, to be about flat with the previous month. In May, U.S. auto sales rose 10.7% from a year earlier.    The May consumer credit report, to be released Friday, is expected to show a slight decline, partly because of a drop in auto loans. In April, consumer credit totaled $3.6 billion.    ---   MARK-UP: Consumers can expect prices to go up faster in the second half, according to a report from Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Consumer prices should rise 4.5% to 5% for 1988 as a whole, compared with just under 4% last year, Sandamp;P's midyear price forecast says. The report says prices will rise more rapidly than in the past five years but not at a double-digit rate. It says prices will rise most quickly on travel and leisure activities and in health care. On the positive side, it says auto prices should remain steady over the next few months and that electricity, natural gas, oil and gasoline prices could drop in the second half.    ---                   The Economy in Numbers         Statistics Released in the Week Ended July 1                                               CHANGE                                               (from prior                                   TOTAL        period)   Money Supply    M1 Week ended    June 20 (in billions)          $778.6      +  $6.8    M2 Week ended    June 20 (in billions)        $3,018.4      +  $5.5    M3 Week ended    June 20 (in billions)        $3,803.3      +  $9.5   Manufacturing orders   May (in billions)              $217.97      -   0.6%   Manufacturing shipments   May (in billions)              $217.81      +   1.4%   Leading indicators   May, Index                      192.6%      -   0.1%   Purchasing managers' index   June                             59.3%      +   4.2   New homes sold   May, annual rate               658,000      -   0.3%   New jobless claims   Week ended June 18             307,000      +   3.0%   Construction spending   May, annual rate   (in billions)                   $407.1      +   1.1%   Sindlinger Consumer   Confidence Percentage   Three-day period   (June 28-29-30) 66.0       +   1.4%             Statistics to Be Released This Week   Auto Sales   June                             Wed.
