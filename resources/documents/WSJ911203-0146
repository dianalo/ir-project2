Orrin Hatch called Bank of Commerce andamp;Credit International's chief executive, Swaleh Naqvi, andearlier wrote the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., ina bid to help Monzer Hourani, a Houston-based friend who nowmanages several thousands of dollars for the Utah Republican.   &quot;I did call Naqvi,&quot; Sen. Hatch said in an interviewyesterday. &quot;Maybe he'd be willing to finance Mr. Hourani, anArab-American, a naturalized citizen,&quot; the senator explained.</LP><TEXT>   The senator said he was concerned that possiblediscrimination against Arab-Americans might have preventedMr. Hourani from obtaining credit. Sending Mr. Hourani toBCCI, &quot;an Arab bank,&quot; might help, the senator said yesterday.   &quot;It couldn't have lasted more than a minute,&quot; Mr. Hatchsaid of his telephone call last year to the London office ofMr. Naqvi, who was indicted recently by a New York grand juryand by federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., and Tampa,Fla., on charges that include false accounting, fraud andmoney-laundering at BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) Inc. and itssubsidiary units. Sen. Hatch said he hadn't had any othercontact with Mr. Naqvi, either before or since his telephoneconversation in 1990.   Sen. Hatch's representations on behalf of Mr. Hourani addanother dimension to what is known about the lawmaker's linksto BCCI. Previously, it was reported that he defended BCCI ina speech before the Senate and that he met on at least a fewoccasions with Mohammed Hammoud, who government investigatorsallege was an important nominee shareholder and front man forBCCI.   The senator has said he was unaware of Mr. Hammoud's tiesto BCCI until the middle of 1990, some time after his lastmeeting with Mr. Hammoud occurred. Sen. Hatch also has saidthat he has met with Adnan Khashoggi, another Middle Easternmoney man who has been linked to BCCI through his involvementin the Iran-Contra scandal. Mr. Khashoggi was an importantinvestor in Utah, Sen. Hatch's home state.   Sen. Hatch said that he thinks he got Mr. Naqvi's namefrom his friend Robert Altman, who then -- along withWashington attorney Clark Clifford -- represented BCCI in theU.S. Messrs. Altman and Clifford also served as top officersof, and counsel to, First American Bankshares Inc., which theFederal Reserve said earlier this year was majority owned byBCCI. Messrs. Clifford and Altman assert that they werefooled about BCCI's covert ownership of First American.   Mr. Hourani is a member of the Mormon church, as is Sen.Hatch. The Utah Republican said Mr. Hourani &quot;wasn't able toget financing.&quot; Adding that he was trying to help a friend,Sen. Hatch said of Mr. Hourani: &quot;He's clearly a high-qualityperson&quot; and is &quot;like a brother to me.&quot;   In an earlier interview, Mr. Hourani said he had appliedfor credit at BCCI at Sen. Hatch's suggestion but had neverborrowed anything from the bank.   Sen. Hatch's approach to the FSLIC on behalf of Mr.Hourani came in a July 31, 1986, letter concerning a disputebetween Mr. Hourani and Mainland Savings of Houston, whichhad been taken over by the regulatory agency.   Addressed to Peter Stearns in the agency director'soffice, the letter said that Sen. Hatch &quot;doesn't want tointerfere in any way with the {FSLIC's} processes,&quot; but iturged the agency to resolve discussions with Mr. Hourani'sattorneys. Failure to settle, the letter suggested, mightresult in long and costly legal proceedings. &quot;We wouldsuggest that you have your Washington staff look into thissituation on an immediate basis before the matter becomesmore difficult,&quot; the letter said.   Sen. Hatch takes responsibility for the letter, but hesays he doesn't believe he'd ever seen it until the past fewdays. That is because a staffer used &quot;an automatic pen&quot; toput his signature on it, the senator explained. &quot;I nevercalled the people there,&quot; Sen. Hatch said of the FSLIC.   A Sept. 19, 1986, reply from Harry Quillian, FSLIC generalcounsel, said that while Mr. Hourani believes he has claimsagainst Mainland Savings, the FSLIC &quot;believes that it may beMainland that has claims against Mr. Hourani.&quot;   In 1988, Mr. Hatch placed $10,000 in a trust administeredby Mr. Hourani, who invested that money in a small Houstonapartment. Both Mr. Hourani and Sen. Hatch refer to the trustas a &quot;blind trust,&quot; and Sen. Hatch says he has never seen theapartment.   An NBC television news report broadcast last week saidthat investigators were looking into Sen. Hatch's allegedlinks to BCCI. In response, Sen. Hatch contacted the JusticeDepartment and received a letter from G. Allen Carver,principal deputy chief of the fraud section, saying &quot;youaren't now either a subject or a target of our BCCI-relatedinvestigations.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
