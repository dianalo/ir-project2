No group claimed responsibility for the attack late Friday night,the fourth guerrilla raid against Israel in a week.   Jordan today said it arrested men who infiltrated Jordan fromIsrael, apparently referring to the guerrillas who ambushed theIsraeli army patrol.   The official Jordanian news agency, Petra, did not say how manymen were arrested, but it said they were captured at 7 a.m. in WadiAraba, the same region where the attack on the Israeli soldiers tookplace.   Petra said the incident was under investigation, but it gave noother details and did not explicitly link the arrests to the Israeliattack.   The guerrillas ambushed the Israeli army patrol in the southernHatzeva area 70 miles south of Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesmansaid on condition of anonymity. He said the troops responded withgunfire.   Reserve Sgt. Oren Lior, 22, the commander of the unit, was killedin the gunbattle and another soldier was wounded in the arm, thespokesman said.   The spokesman said a military unit discovered the tracks of twomen, showing they had crossed into Israel from Jordan and thenreturned.   According to Israel radio, the ambush occurred when the armypatrol followed tracks in the dirt and heard a man shout in English:``Stop!'' from behind a bush. The guerrillas then opened fire fromtwo directions.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin blamed Palestinian guerrillas forthe attack. ``The Egyptian border, the Lebanese border and theJordanian one are different. If there is something in common it'sthe wish of the Palestinian terror groups to attack us from all thedirections,'' he said on Israel radio.   ``We hold Jordan responsible for preventing any infiltrationsfrom its territory. Moreover, we demand the Jordanian government doeverything to find who committed this vile murder and to makecertain this will not happen in the future,'' Rabin said.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, chief of the army's southerncommand, described the incident as ``serious'' and said on Israelradio the attack ``makes it necessary to take efficient steps on theother side of the border to prevent any infiltrations into ourterritory and attacks on our soldiers.''   In Jordan, Information Minister Hani Khasawneh said, ``It is notnecessary that we comment on every story Israel broadcasts.''   Two other raids this week were in southern Lebanon and the thirdacross the border with Egypt.</TEXT></DOC>
