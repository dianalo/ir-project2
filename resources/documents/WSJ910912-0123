Grain handlers at the west coast terminals of Vancouverand Prince Rupert and at the Lake Superior port of ThunderBay refused to cross picket lines manned by strikinggovernment grain inspectors.</LP><TEXT>   Sixteen vessels were waiting to take on grain cargoes atthe west coast ports and another 18 were due to arrive laterthis week, the Canadian Wheat Board, a government agency,said. The 34 vessels were scheduled to load a total of 1.2million metric tons of western Canadian grain for shipment tomostly Asian markets. At Thunder Bay, no vessels werewaiting, but four are due to arrive later this week.   Most other industries reported little immediate impactfrom the strike, but executives warned that if the stoppageruns for more than a week it could jeopardize the Canadianeconomy's recovery from its year-long recession.   The strike has caused some minor production distruptions.Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary was forced to haltproduction of the Dodge Ram full-size van at its Windsor,Ontario, plant for two hours Tuesday because of astrike-delayed shipment of axles.   Donald McArthur, president of the Canadian Importers'Association, said he didn't know of any other production lineshutdowns as a result of the strike. But he said thegovernment workers' strike &quot;has potentially very seriousimplications&quot; for the $178 billion of trade between the U.S.and Canada.   Thomas King, president of Federal Industries Ltd.'strucking operations, said trucks were encountering delays ofup to eight hours at U.S.-Canada border crossings as a resultof work-to-rule actions by Canadian customs men. The customsmen are prohibited from striking, but some have worked torule out of sympathy with the strikers.   A spokesman for Oshawa Group Ltd., a Toronto foodretailer, said there wasn't any shortage of U.S. supplies,but deliveries from the U.S. were delayed at the border.   The strike crippled flights Monday at the country'sbiggest air hub, Toronto's Pearson International Airport. Butby yesterday the two biggest airlines, Air Canada andCanadian Airlines International, said only a few flights hadto be canceled.   Canadian National Railway Co. and CP Rail, a unit ofCanadian Pacific Ltd., said rail traffic was operatingnormally except for grain that is backed up by the portstoppages. The St. Lawrence Seaway Authority also reportedthat it was operating normally.   The Canadian Manufacturers Association and the CanadianFederation of Independent Business urged the government tolegislate a return to work by the strikers. Governmentworkers, except those deemed to fill essential jobs, have hadthe right to strike since 1967.   &quot;Surely allowing the shutdown, or even the threat ofshutting down, of any part of the Canadian economy deserves arapid, firm and decisive response,&quot; said John Bulloch,president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business,which represents mostly small and medium size businesses.   A government spokesmen said the strike situation is beingexamined on a daily basis. The government has repeatedly saidit will only introduce back-towork legislation in Parliamentif the strike disrupts government services.   The strike is in support of wage claims and involvesworkers in all departments. The government, as part of itsdeficit reduction effort, has offered no wage increase thisyear and only a 3% increase in each of the two followingyears.   Timothy Reid, president of the Canadian Chamber ofCommerce, said business has little sympathy with either sidein the dispute. &quot;It is damn both your houses,&quot; he said. &quot;Wewant them to get back together and to settle this thing.&quot;Government and the Public Service Alliance of Canada havebroken off their negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
