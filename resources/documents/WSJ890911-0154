It may be a long wait.    Whether the next step is a cowardly murder of a hostage or a quiet negotiation that finally leads to the captives' release, most of the analysts in and out of the government believe things are on hold for the moment and may stay that way for the foreseeable future.    All hasten to add that too little is known about the inner workings of Hezbollah -- the Lebanese organization linked to the kidnappings -- and its exact ties to Iran, to be sure what will happen next. But several factors seem to foreshadow a continuing stalemate, in which the kidnappers probably won't kill more hostages for fear of losing leverage, but Iran's new government and Hezbollah's leaders will drag out any bargaining with contradictory signals and impossible demands -- at least for a while.    &quot;There are no talks or anything like that going on,&quot; says a top State Department official involved with the problem. &quot;If there was a moment at which somebody might have pressed the right button, that moment is gone.&quot; For now, he says, &quot;we have to try and influence those who influence the terrorists. The solution lies in Iran and Syria.&quot;    Hopes soared that Iran might have a new attitude toward the hostages when Hezbollah lifted its threat to kill hostage Joseph Cicippio last month and hinted that requests from Tehran played a part. Then, in Iran, President Hashemi Rafsanjani ousted from his cabinet some of the most aggressive proponents of terrorism, especially Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who personally had encouraged Hezbollah to go after Americans.    But hopes for an end to the hostage crisis have yet to be borne out, and frustrated U.S. officials admit they can't be sure why the murder was called off or what President Rafsanjani intends.    &quot;I don't think they ever intended to kill Cicippio and the others,&quot; ventures a top French expert on Hezbollah who writes under the pen name of Xavier Raufer. &quot;Hostages for them are more than dollars, they are life insurance.&quot; As for hints from the kidnappers about Iran's supposed beneficient intervention, he says &quot;they probably wanted the Americans to believe that.&quot;    That doesn't mean that the kidnappers can't be induced to give up the captives, if their state patrons insist they do so. Besides Iran, which is ruled by religious leaders to whom the terrorists swear loyalty, the hostage-taking gangs look to Syria, which controls the territory in Lebanon where they operate.    But the attitudes of Iran and Syria aren't clear. Iran experts were cheered by the exit of Mr. Mohtashemi, but many believe he still exercises hard-line influence. And his successor as Iran's interior minister, Abdollah Nouri, may also have been involved in sanctioning terrorism. He was a top figure in the radical Revolutionary Guards, which is closely tied to Hezbollah. And some investigators even believe he may have played a role in arranging the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last December.    Syrian President Hafez Assad seems unlikely to put much pressure on Hezbollah to give up the hostages right now, when he is seeking Hezbollah's support for his war against Lebanon's Christians. The U.S. has quietly challenged the Soviet Union to prove it opposes terrorism by leaning on its Syrian clients to help free the hostages, but there has been no response so far.    Mr. Raufer believes Tehran holds the key to resolving the problem. &quot;The direction comes from Iran, and it will probably take a religious order to free the hostages,&quot; he says. &quot;Somebody in Tehran will have to let Hezbollah know that they're not interested in the hostages anymore.    Last year, France won the release of three hostages in an apparent -- but officially denied -- trade for restoring diplomatic relations with Iran and releasing funds Tehran was owed. At the time, the French pact was widely attacked as a thinly veiled ransom. But something like that is much talked about now as a way of releasing the U.S. hostages. The Bush administration has hinted that, if Iran shapes up, the U.S. might consider freeing Tehran's funds here.    It would probably take a long time for Presidents Bush and Rafsanjani to reach such an agreement.    In the bazaars of the Middle East, bargains seem to be everywhere, but sealing a real accord, one that you can talk about with pride later, takes patience and guile. American politicians aren't known for either. </TEXT></DOC>
