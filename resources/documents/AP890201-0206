Sakharov said Wednesday that his defeatin a bid to represent the Academy of Sciences in a new Sovietparliament showed the academy's ruling presidium is not ready fordemocratic reform.   But Pravda, the Communist Party daily, rejected suggestions thatundemocratic procedures were used to block Sakharov's nomination.   The 67-year-old dean of the Soviet human rights movement againhas become a controversial figure in Moscow, but this time he isbeing both criticized and defended in the state-run press that onceeither ignored or vilified him.   A band of Sakharov's supporters called a meeting for Thursday toprotest his Jan. 18 electoral defeat, although he was nominated twodays later as a parliamentary candidate from a Moscow district.   Sakharov is among several thousand candidates for the new2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies, a parliamentary body thatwill be elected in March and which will in turn elect a full-timelegislature and a president.   There is little doubt President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whoproposed creation of the new parliamentary body, will be re-electedhead of state.   Sakharov was quoted in the weekly Literary Gazette, a newspaperpopular among Soviet intellectuals, as saying the nominating processin the Academy of Sciences worked well at the lower level, whereyounger scientists hold sway.   But when the leadership made its final picks, he said, only topadministrators were picked to represent the prestigious academy inthe new parliament, which will have representatives from bothgeographic districts and from professional, political and socialorganizations.   He charged the leadership failed to fulfill its legal obligationsand ignored the popular will in selecting its candidates.   Pravda, however, said the meeting at which Sakharov was defeated``was not only fully democratic but benevolent.''   After his defeat in a bid to represent the academy, he won theoverwhelming support of members of his own institute as a candidatefor a seat in the district where the academy is located.   Sakharov is a physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogenbomb and later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his human rightsactivities.   The government newspaper Izvestia, meanwhile, criticized Sakharovfor suggesting in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figarothat Gorbachev could be toppled or stymied by Soviet conservatives.   It said such statements, unsupported by solid information, causeconfusion and uncertainty and can only harm Gorbachev's reforms.</TEXT></DOC>
