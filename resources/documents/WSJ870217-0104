Historically, the federal courts handled &quot;cases of major importance,&quot; Justice Scalia said in a speech to the American Bar Association's mid-year convention.    &quot;As that changes,&quot; he said; &quot;as we deal with more and more cases of less and less import; as we become case processors and caseload managers, it is inevitable . . . that once the image catches up with the reality, the stature of the job, and the quality of the people it attracts, will decline.&quot;    Justice Scalia suggested a system of specialized courts, similar to the current Tax Court. For example, he said that appeals of government decisions about Social Security disability benefits could be appealed to a special Social Security court instead of occupying the time of the regular federal courts.    While Justice Scalia isn't the first to advocate new, specialized courts, his speech is likely to rekindle debate over how to ease the flood of cases in the federal courts.    The problem is partly demonstrated by statistics Justice Scalia used in his first address to the ABA since he joined the Supreme Court last fall. Since 1960, he said, the number of new cases filed for each district court judge has increased to more than 470 a year from 250. The number of appeals has increased to more than 220 per appeals court judge from 60.    In recent years, various ABA or government studies have focused on proposals to move cases faster and at less cost through the federal courts and have urged more use of arbitration and other means of resolving disputes outside the courtroom.    But the justice said most of these proposals, and pressure to continually boost the number of federal judges, address only the problem of the federal courts' backlog, not the loss of stature. Lawyers who aspire to be federal judges, don't &quot;want to dispose of predominantly routine cases -- efficiently or otherwise,&quot; he said.    Most of the recent debate in Congress and in the ABA, led by Chief Justice Warren Burger until he retired last fall, focused on a proposal to create a new federal appeals court to resolve conflicting rulings among other federal appeals courts. That proposal, pending for several years, would ease only the Supreme Court's workload and has diverted attention from the problem of the federal courts generally.    Specialized courts would address the problem more broadly, Justice Scalia said. But the proposal becomes controversial when discussing what kinds of cases are suitable for special courts.    In listing categories of cases that have flooded the federal courts, Justice Scalia mentioned civil rights disputes over employers failing to promote specific employees, civil rights actions against local officials for improper conduct, and lawsuits over requests made under the Freedom of Information Act.    Pushing some of these categories to special courts surely would draw protests from civil rights and civil liberties groups that consider the issues a high priority.    In another, largely historical speech at the convention, Chief Justice William Rehnquist praised the Constitution's provisions that enable the courts to interpret the Constitution independently without being &quot;subservient to either the executive or legislative branches.&quot;    Chief Justice Rehnquist's first report to the ABA, following a tradition started by former Chief Justice Burger, contrasted somewhat with the views of President Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese, who have urged a narrower role for federal judges. </TEXT></DOC>
