Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LKS ASC </CO><IN> TNM RET </IN><TEXT>   Lucky Stores Inc. said it received &quot;proposals regarding the possible acquisition of the company,&quot; while its only publicly known suitor, American Stores Co., pressed for an auction of its grocery-store rival.    Lucky, which had solicited the bids as an alternative to a pending tender offer and other overtures from Salt Lake City-based American Stores, declined to provide details. Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky said it was &quot;reviewing these proposals as well as other means of providing greater value to stockholders than the American Stores offer and proposal.&quot;    Lucky stock jumped at the disclosure. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Lucky closed at $55.375 a share, up $1.375, on volume of 1.3 million shares; American Stores closed at $60.25 a share, off 12.5 cents. Lucky stock has risen about 75% since before American Stores announced a $45-a-share, or $1.74 billion, tender offer last month.    Meanwhile, American Stores tried harder to push Lucky to the bargaining table. Lucky has resisted giving American Stores any confidential financial data for fear it would give it an unfair advantage over other bidders. In a letter to Lucky's board, made public yesterday, American Stores proposed to remedy the situation by urging Lucky to set up a formal auction of the company.    Under the proposed arrangement, all interested bidders would be given the information this week, with an auction to be held no later than Monday. The winner would have to sign a merger agreement with Lucky by May 6. The losers would agree to not interfere for 50 days following the merger accord. In the letter, American Stores indicated it would go to court, if spurned again.    &quot;We very much want to make the highest bid you will receive to acquire Lucky Stores,&quot; American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs said in the letter. &quot;We would very much like to work with you, rather than to engage in wasteful litigation.&quot;    American Stores offered to negotiate a friendly merger at as much as $50 a share, an approach that Lucky rejected.    The big surge in Lucky's stock puts immense pressure on management to do something. Aside from selling itself, the company has indicated several other options were being considered.    These include a sale of assets that would strip Lucky down to its California operations, returning funds to shareholders through a special dividend or a share buy-back, or launching a leveraged buy-out. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. The debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Last year, in turning away a hostile offer from New York investor Asher B. Edelman, Lucky sold off non-grocery operations and bought 27% of its stock at a premium. Some analysts said last year's paring of operations would make a highly leveraged transaction difficult because fewer attractive assets are available to be sold for debt repayment.    Nonetheless, the idea is one that another San Francisco-area grocery chain has tried with recent success. Oakland, Calif.-based Safeway Stores Inc. just disclosed that it trimmed total debt by 32% last year. Some analysts expect Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the leveraged buy-out firm that took Safeway private in 1986, will take it public again soon. </TEXT></DOC>
