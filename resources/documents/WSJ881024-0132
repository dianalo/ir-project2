Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BVG CHM BNK TRA AIR NUK UTI </IN><G> CNG EXE JUS </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress cleared a compromise anti-drug bill imposing tough new penalties for using or selling drugs -- but it did so only after lawmakers removed several sweeping provisions that had raised constitutional questions.    The measure was the last bill to pass before the 100th Congress adjourned, so it attracted a number of unrelated provisions -- including broad attacks on child pornography and obscenity and an expansion of federal racketeering and fraud laws.    The Senate approved the legislation on a voice vote in the predawn hours Saturday. Earlier, the House voted 346-11 to ratify the bill. President Reagan is expected to sign it into law.    Reflecting election-year pressure on lawmakers to take a strong stand against illicit drugs, the measure would permit the death penalty for those convicted in federal courts of drug-related killings, establish a civil fine of as much as $10,000 for those caught with even small amounts of such illegal drugs as marijuana and cocaine and, beginning next September, allow courts to deny certain federal benefits to convicted drug offenders.    But civil liberties advocates said lawmakers dropped most provisions that would have cut back constitutional protections for accused people. &quot;Except for the death penalty and pornography provisions, we see no threats to civil liberties in the bill,&quot; said Morton Halperin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington office. &quot;And there are even some improvements over current law.&quot;    House-Senate negotiators agreed to drop a provision that would have narrowed the long-standing &quot;exclusionary rule,&quot; which prohibits the use in a trial of evidence that was obtained illegally. Some lawmakers questioned the constitutionality of the provision, which wouldn't have been limited to drug-related cases.    The drug bill would create a new cabinet-level office to draw up budget requests for the various federal drug programs, eliminating drug-related offices headed by Vice President George Bush and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh. Mr. Bush has said he would want his vice president to coordinate anti-drug efforts, but the bill says the head of the office couldn't hold any other administration position.    The measure would provide an additional $484.8 million for anti-drug programs for the current fiscal year, on top of the $4 billion that already has been appropriated. It also would require chemical makers and distributors to file periodic reports about shipments of chemicals that could be used to make illicit drugs.    In other areas, the measure would restore federal prosecutors' ability to try corrupt public officials for violating citizens' intangible rights to an honest government. That effectively would reverse a 1987 Supreme Court ruling that restricted prosecutions under federal mail and wire fraud laws to cases of tangible economic injury.    The bill would allow the federal government to seize obscene materials, equipment used to produce them and profits they generate. It also would stiffen penalties for the use of children in pornography and would create a new federal crime aimed at businesses that regularly sell or produce obscene materials.    The measure also would require warning labels on alcoholic beverages.    To combat money laundering, the legislation would strengthen record-keeping requirements for large cash transactions at financial institutions. It also would require banks abroad to maintain records of large cash transactions, and it would block these banks from participating in any U.S. dollar-clearing or wire-transfer system if they don't share such records with U.S. drug investigators.    Civil liberties advocates said the death penalty provision includes protections that go beyond what the Supreme Court has required in rulings on state capital punishment laws. They also voiced satisfaction that lawmakers softened a provision allowing for civil fines in drug cases by including a number of protections for defendants.    House-Senate negotiators also dropped broad House language denying federal benefits to those convicted of selling or using drugs. Instead, they approved a Senate provision that would give courts discretion to deny benefits and would exempt certain benefits, such as those for retirement, welfare, health, disability and veterans' programs. The cut-off provision couldn't go into effect until the Justice Department writes guidelines for it.    Lawmakers also dropped a provision in the Senate bill that would have mandated random drug testing of transportation and nuclear power plant employees.    ---   Stephen Wermiel also contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
