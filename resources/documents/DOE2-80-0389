The results is a versatility of cheap plastichouse constructions,very poorly equipped with technological installations, control and measuringequipment, usually not or only partially heated. Taking in account presentstatus of greenhouse constructions and heating technics in them, it isnecessary to investigate possibilities for geothermal energy introductionin the greenhouse production sector in most possible. i.e. economicallyjustified way. The conclusions can be of wider interest, if giving usableindications about geothermal energy introduction in greenhouse productionsector in Mediterranean countries. The base for analysis are collectedexperiences, reached through the collaboration of European, Israelian,Lebanonian and Tunisian scientists and specialists in the frame of FAO/CNRENetwork on Geothermal Energy Use in Agriculture from 1985 to 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
