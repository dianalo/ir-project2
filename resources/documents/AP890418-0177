Bush reiterated his pledge to support a diplomatic solution inNicaragua and repeated his call for the Soviet Union to advance thepeace process by ending its military aid to Nicaragua's leftistgovernment.   ``The Soviet Union must match its rhetorical support for thepeace process with concrete action to halt military aid, to endsubversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy inNicaragua,'' Bush said.   Administration officials have stated they want to see positiveaction in that vein by the Soviet Union, and that it could resultin a more favorable economic or trade stance toward the Soviets bythe United States.   Officials estimate the Soviet Union provides about $500 milliona year to Nicaragua in military aid and about the same amount ineconomic aid.   A top State Department official, meanwhile, said he had warnedthe Contras that they risk a cutoff of the new aid unless theyexpel a commander convicted of human rights abuses.   ``Legally we would have the basis,'' to halt the aid, said ChrisArcos, deputy assistant secretary of state.   He said the Contra military tribunal last month had convicted acommander known by the nom de guerre Commandante Mack, but that theleader was seen in the Contra camps subsequent to the time heshould have been expelled.   Arcos said he has been assured by the Contra leadership thatthey expel those convicted of human rights abuses, but that he wastrying to find out if that had occurred with Commandante Mack.   In brief remarks in a Rose Garden ceremony before he signed thecompromise legislation his administration worked out with Congress,Bush threw the ball to Nicaragua's Sandinista government.   ``The success of the Central American peace process and theprospects of national reconciliation in Nicaragua depend on fulland honest Sandinista compliance with their repeated pledges ofdemocracy and freedom.''   ``It's clear that close international scrutiny and sustainedpressure will be critical to induce Sandinista compliance.''   The new aid package was worked out on March 24 after lengthynegotiations between administration officials and congresssionalleaders.   Bush was joined at the signing by Democratic and Republicanleaders of the House and Senate.   The compromise represented a major breakthrough in U.S. policytoward Central America, following years of conflicting actions.Bush's agreement to forgo military aid in favor of a diplomaticapproach was a break with the Reagan administration's unrelentingpush for military support for the rebels.   The package calls for humanitarian assistance to providenon-lethal aid to the rebels until the Nicaraguan electionsscheduled for next February.   The money also could be used to repatriate the Contras underconditions considered politically acceptable for their return.   The Bush administration is pushing for establishment ofdemocratic reforms by the Sandinistas as part of those conditions.   ``We've yet to see genuine Sandinista compliance,'' Bush saidTuesday. ``Thus far, they've refused to negotiate with theopposition regarding the necessary conditions for fair elections,''he added.   The aid money will go through the State Department's Agency forInternational Development program, cutting out any involvment bythe CIA, which has sometimes posed a sticking point in pastcongressional debates on the Contra issue.   The package also includes $4.2 million, through AID to beadministered by the Catholic Church in Nicaragua, in medicalassistance for civilian victims of the civil war.   The Contras, an army estimated at about 11,000 fighters, areencamped along the Honduran border. Although the military aidneeded to keep them at war has been discontinued by Congress, theyhave been kept alive with U.S. food and humanitarian assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
