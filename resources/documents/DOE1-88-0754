For this reason, fault-diagnosis at thesystem level, a research area pioneered by the work of Preparata, Metze,and Chien, is of increasing importance. The formalization of their modelutilizes directed graphs together with labelings on edges and vertices.The two central problems introduced by the model are called the diagnosisand diagnosability problems. In the diagnosis problem, an algorithm mustidentify the faulty units of a system based on test results. In the diagnosabilityproblem, an algorithm must determine the maximum number of faulty unitsa system can contain and still be guaranteed capable of successfullytesting itself. One of the main open questions is resolved for this modelby presenting the first polynomial time algorithm for the diagnosabilityproblem. The solution uses network-flow techniques and runs in O(absolutevalue E absolute value V/sup 3/2/) time. Also presented is a new time-complexitybound of O(min(t absolute value E, t{sup 3} + absolute value E)) forthe diagnosis problem, where t is the maximum number of faulty units.</TEXT></DOC>
