Dealers said the Bank of Japan bought at least $1.5 billion with yen in Tokyo trading yesterday. The West German Bundesbank and the Bank of England, in what traders called an unusual move, sold yen to buy an additional $500 million. European central banks generally intervene in their own currencies.    In the past two days, the central banks of Japan, Britain, West Germany and the U.S. are believed to have sold yen to buy as much as $4.5 billion. The action is seen as the first major show of cooperation under an agreement to enforce stability in the currency market. The accord was signed by the U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain and Canada in Paris Feb. 22.    Foreign exchange traders, meanwhile, continued to insist yesterday that the dollar is overvalued in relation to the yen. Several said the U.S. currency probably would fall substantially if the central banks stopped buying dollars.    &quot;It's amazing. . . . I'm actually surprised that the dollar's recovery was not that much, given the fact that all the central banks were intervening,&quot; Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo's New York branch, said. &quot;That says to me that the dollar is still in the process of going down.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8309 West German marks, up 0.5% from 1.8225 Tuesday. The British pound dropped 0.7% to $1.6003 from $1.6113.    At the same time, the dollar climbed just 0.2% to 149.35 yen from 149.01. As the Bank of Japan resumed its intervention in early trading yesterday, the dollar flirted with but wasn't able to pass the 150-yen level.    &quot;The dollar enjoyed a pretty decent day except when you look at dollar-yen,&quot; Axel Coym, vice president, foreign exchange, at Westpac Banking Corp. said. &quot;Without central bank intervention,&quot; he said, &quot;we'd be lower.&quot;    The dollars purchased by central banks are &quot;a nice piece of change to take out of the foreign-exchange market, and the dollar is still pretty weak,&quot; he said.    But although dealers continued to be bearish about the dollar's yen rate, they voiced caution about overselling the U.S. currency as long as central banks appear determined to prop it up.    &quot;I'm staying flat,&quot; Robert Cassidy, vice president, foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker commented on the dollar yesterday without causing any discernible impact on trading. Answering questions before a panel of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Baker pointed to last month's Paris accord as representing the U.S. position on the dollar. The accord shows &quot;in no uncertain terms,&quot; he said, that major currencies' values now broadly reflect underlying economic fundamentals.    Mr. Baker also rejected suggestions that Japan and West Germany aren't holding up their end of the accord. He said he sees some evidence that both countries are making progress in stimulating their economies as requested by the U.S.    Traders attributed the dollar's weakness against the yen yesterday to the continuing U.S. trade and budget deficits and the potential problems for the U.S. financial system posed by the Third World debt crisis.    &quot;Nobody sees any reason to buy the dollar,&quot; Peter Wild, vice president at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co., New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell 50 cents to $413 an ounce in brisk trading estimated at 4.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $412.60 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, March 25, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
