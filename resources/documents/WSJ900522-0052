To Sell Unit   To Bayer AG   ----   By Lynne Kilpatrick   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/22/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6</SO><CO>   NVA G.BAY I.EMT</CO><IN>TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM)</IN><LP>   Nova Corp. of Alberta said it agreed to sell its rubberoperations to Bayer AG of West Germany for 1.25 billionCanadian dollars (US$1.06 billion).   The purchase price is at the high end of analysts'expectations, but the sale of the assets isn't seen by all asa good move.</LP><TEXT>   When the Calgary, Alberta, company announced it wasseeking buyers for the rubber operations, the investmentcommunity was divided. Some analysts worried that the companywas getting rid of its crown jewel and a major source of cashflow that wasn't dependent on the cyclical swings of thepetrochemical and pipeline industries, Nova's corebusinesses. Others said they expected the sale to boost thevalue of Nova's shares, which has languished in recentmonths.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Nova closed up 50 cents a share to $7.375, well off its52-week high of $9.50.   The rubber division is part of Polysar Ltd. that Novaacquired in 1988 for C$1.3 billion. Nova said it expects toeither break even or report a small gain on the sale.   Nova acquired Polysar at the peak of the petrochemicalscycle. The company's earnings took a dive and its share pricefollowed. Robert Hastings, an analyst with RichardsonGreenshields of Canada Ltd., said if Nova can pull a smallgain out of the sale of the rubber division, it will havedone all right.   William G. Wilson, Nova's chief financial officer, saidBayer will assume C$100 million of the rubber division's debtand C$130 million in other liabilities.   Analysts said the move is strategically important to Bayerbecause it will give it a much bigger presence in the largeU.S. market. But they said the rubber division comes to Bayerat a high price, particularly because of the current weaknessin the auto industry, a chief client to rubber productsmakers.   &quot;Let's just say they didn't underpay; 1.3 times sales is avery full price,&quot; said Alasdair Nisbet, a chemicals analystwith London's UBS Phillips andamp; Drew.   Nova's Mr. Wilson said Bayer was &quot;prepared to pay thatstrategic premium&quot; for access to the North American market.   The sale to Bayer has already raised the ire of at leastone other potential bidder. Enimont S.p.A. of Italy said itwas invited to bid for the Polysar division but was preventedfrom doing so because of the announced sale. An Enimontspokeswoman said the proposed sale to Bayer didn't respectthe bidding rules. She said bids were due yesterday, but theannouncement yesterday morning made the competitive bidsobsolete.   Bayer, which has interests in chemicals, health care andimaging technologies, said it &quot;will maintain, and may expand&quot;Polysar's main facility in Sarnia, Ontario.   Nova's rubber division is a leading producer of syntheticrubber, primarily for the tire industry. It contributed C$812million to Nova's 1989 sales of C$4.84 billion and expectssales of C$900 million this year. The division has plants inCanada, the U.S., Belgium and France with combined annualcapacity of about 530,000 tons. Bayer's rubber productioncapacity totals only 150,000 tons a year.   Bayer said it has had preliminary discussions withofficials of Investment Canada and will be submitting itsapplication to them in the near future. It hopes to close thetransaction this fall.   Nova said it will use the proceeds from the sale to reduceits debt. At the end of 1989, the company's long-term debtstood at about C$3.8 billion.   The rubber division was just one of several blocks of Novaassets up for sale. The company put four small companies onthe block last June with a combined value of C$500 millionand has had little luck finding buyers. Nova said recentlythat it is also considering a public offering of shares inits affiliate, Husky Oil Ltd., a large oil and natural gasproducer that analysts value at C$1.5 billion.   Analysts say the company is selling the assets in anattempt to improve earnings. In the first quarter, Nova hadnet income of C$36 million, or 11 Canadian cents a share, onrevenue of C$1.20 billion, compared with net of C$129million, or 51 Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$1.30billion a year earlier.   Mr. Hastings, the Richardson Greenshields analyst, saidthe rubber division sale will definitely improve Nova'searnings, and increase its ability to get financing. However,he said the company is &quot;a little bit more cyclical than theywere yesterday.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
