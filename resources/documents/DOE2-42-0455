These defects range from cracks in structural members toobsolete design criteria. Given such defects, and a proposed operationsscenario for the structure, the question addressed in this paper is howto qualify the platform for its intended service. This paper outlinesand illustrates a general approach for requalifying fixed and mobileplatforms. The AIM (Assessment, Inspection, Maintenance) approach isthe product of a series of joint industry and government sponsored projectsconducted since 1986.
