About 5,000 people rallied to demand theousted leader's return.   Marcos also asked Mrs. Aquino to allow him to return to bury his95-year-old mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4.   On Friday, Marcos claimed he was negotiating with Manila andWashington to return for the funeral and he expected the talks tobe finalized in a few days.   There was no immediate comment from the government to Marcos'latest statement, broadcast by Manila radio stations. Earliertoday, Mrs. Aquino's spokesman said the imminent return of Marcoswas ``impossible.''   ``I ... reiterate that I oppose violence, that I have nointention of mounting a coup d'etat or causing a civil war,''Marcos said in a statement read by telephone from Hawaii by hisspokesman Gemmo Trinidad.   ``Instead let us join forces with Madame Aquino so that thecommunists and some rebel bands would not venture to commit acts ofadventurism to challenge the stability of the current government.''   In another statement issued Friday by his followers, Marcos saidhe hoped an agreement on his return could be reached ``in a day ortwo.''   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, branded the statementmeaningless. U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt told reporters thatAmerican officials ``just haven't been involved at all'' innegotiations regarding Marcos' return.   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded near sundown today at militaryheadquarters, killing one soldier, officials said. The building hasbeen vacant since being set ablaze during an August coup attempt.   Navy Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, said the victimwas believed to be a member of a roving guard force and may havepicked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed.   ``It's an accident,'' Cabingan said. ``It`s not connected withanything political or whatever. It's just a simple accident as wesee it.''   Mrs. Aquino, citing national security, has refused to allowMarcos to return for his mother's funeral. Benigno said thedecision was unanimously endorsed by the Cabinet.   ``There is nothing that should cause worry, excitement ornervousness on our people about reports that ex-president Marcoswill return,'' Benigno said. ``There is no truth to that.''   Marcos supporters gathered today under a blistering sun in adowntown square and marched to the Mendiola Bridge about 300 yardsfrom the presidential palace. March leader Salvador Panelo saidthey would remain there until Mrs. Aquino reversed her decision orMarcos appeared before them.   Police agreed to allow the estimated 5,000 protesters to remainthere as long as the protest was peaceful. About 200 riot police,backed by four water cannon and four firetrucks, guarded theapproach to the palace.   Protesters waved banners reading ``Give Us Marcos or Give UsDeath,'' while others claimed Marcos was the only one who couldstop the Communist insurgency, which erupted and spread nationwideduring Marcos' 20-year rule.   Marcos supporters have been linked to several attempts to topplethe Aquino government. Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 aftera popular uprising.   Marcos told ABC News in an interview Friday that he wouldsupport the Aquino government if he were allowed to return.   ``My mother is dead and I'd like to go home,'' he said in slow,somewhat slurred speech from his home in Honolulu. ``I will supportthe Aquino government to prevent any adventurism or prevent anyattempt at the takeover by the communists.''   ``There is nothing that Madame Aquino should fear from me,'' hesaid. ``I mean well. And if I should be any obstacle, we will beable to work it out.''   The body of Marcos' mother has been lying in state at a suburbanchurch since her death. Marcos supporters say she will be buried innorthern Luzon but have given no firm date for the funeral or forthe body to be taken north.   The United States barred Marcos from leaving Hawaii withoutpermission after the Aquino government claimed he had chartered aplane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attempt succeeded.</TEXT></DOC>
