In the occupied Gaza Strip, two teen-age Palestinian guerrillaswere captured after they infiltrated from Egypt and attacked anIsraeli military outpost with a rifle and grenades. They werewounded, but no troops were hurt, the army said.   A handful of religious Jewish settlers arrived at Talmon, ahilltop spot 12 miles from Jerusalem in the heart of the West Bank,where Palestinians have been rebelling against Israeli rule for thelast 15 months.   ``This place belongs to us,'' said one settler, Yachanan Indech,25. ``All this land was mentioned in the Bible.''   But he said the main importance of the site was strategic.   ``If it were a clear day, you could see the whole city of TelAviv from this hilltop, without a telescope,'' he said. ``With asmall weapon, you could hit any plane that lands at theinternational airport.''   Indech said that by the end of the week, 12 families withchildren would move to the site.   Soldiers were stationed on the hilltop to protect the newsettlement, and the settlers planned to circle the site with coilsof barbed wire before nightfall.   The Jewish activists vowed that seven more of the controversialsettlements would be established in the occupied territory duringthe next four years, as promised by the government.   The United States has said the 130 Jewish settlements and 80,000settlers already in the occupied lands constitute a major stumblingblock to peace. About 1.7 million Arabs live in the territories.   Anti-Israeli protests continued in the occupied territories, andat least eight Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes withtroops, Arab reports and hospital officials said. The army said itwas checking the reports.   Since the beginning of the uprising in December 1987, 396Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed.   The two Palestinian infiltrators slipped across the southernborder before dawn, the army said.   A military source who spoke on condition of anonymity said theirattack failed when a grenade hurled at the military outpost rolledback onto the guerrillas' position and exploded, injuring at leastone of the Arabs. Soldiers opened fire after hearing an explosion,the source said.   The guerrillas, ages 15 and 17, were wounded and captured, thearmy said.   During interrogation the teen-agers said they were members of thefundamentalist Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the army said ina statement.   Military sources said they were planning to kill soldiers, takehostages and return to Egypt.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's southern command,charged that the attack was carried out with the knowledge of PLOChairman Yasser Arafat and his Fatah guerrillas but without helpfrom the Egyptians.   ``According to the terrorists being questioned ... (they went)with the knowledge of Fatah, and with the knowledge of Abu Ammar,''or Arafat, Mordechai said.   He praised the Egyptians for helping find the route theguerrillas had taken and mounting a search for accomplices.   It was the third foiled guerrilla raid this week following two inLebanon. It came after U.S. officials reportedly sought to work outa cease-fire between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization to stop infiltrations from Lebanon.   Attempts to arrange a cease-fire were reported by theEnglish-language Jerusalem Post newspaper before Foreign MinisterMoshe Arens left for the United States on March 10.   Army officials say at least 30 guerrillas have been killed insouthern Lebanon this year while attempting to cross into Israel.Five were killed in the two attempts earlier this week.   The United States has asked the PLO to halt such attacks, but thegroup has said that raids on military targets were not included whenArafat renounced terrorism last year.</TEXT></DOC>
