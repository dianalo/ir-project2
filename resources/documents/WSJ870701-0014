SimpsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   For many philanthropists, the ultimate dream is to endow their own foundation. A private foundation confers more status -- and more control over how the funds are spent -- than any other kind of giving.    But the price on this power and glory is high. Concerned that some wealthy individuals were using foundations to shelter their fortunes instead of to benefit society, Congress has imposed strict laws on how foundations and their donors conduct business. Donors to private foundations are allowed deductions for gifts of up to only 30% of their adjusted gross income in the first year. Donors who give directly to charitable institutions such as hospitals and schools can deduct 50%.    In addition, foundations are required to pay excise taxes on their investment income. They are also subject to payout requirements, excess business-holding limitations and self-dealing restrictions for the principal benefactors and their families.    But there are alternatives. Tax and charity specialists say there are several ways for philanthropists to have their foundations in all but name, to take the more generous tax deductions and sometimes even to escape the extra restrictions.    Donald and Alfred Lippincott, brothers who wanted to fund a private foundation but didn't like the lower tax deduction and other restrictions, discovered one alternative through Stanley Weithorn, a senior tax partner with the law firm of Baer Marks andamp; Upham, in New York. He suggested that the brothers set up a &quot;supporting organization,&quot; a vehicle for charitable contributions that resembles a foundation but operates under fewer restrictions.    Donors to supporting organizations establish a formal association with an established charity. The organization is then limited to funding or &quot;supporting&quot; the kinds of projects, but not necessarily the same projects, in which the parent charity is active. Its board of trustees must also have a majority who aren't donors, their families or close associates.    Gifts to supporting organizations are treated the same way as those to other charities. Accordingly, the Lippincotts were able to claim the maximum deduction last year for the $500,000 gift they made to endow their organization.    The arrangement has worked well for the Lippincotts. They wanted their organization to specialize in projects that promote international understanding, so they formed a comfortable alliance with the Peace Development Fund, whose work they had supported in the past. One of the three outsiders on their five-member board comes from the fund, but the other two are &quot;long-term associates of ours,&quot; says Donald Lippincott, &quot;and so although we don't legally control the board, there haven't been any problems.&quot;    Another alternative is provided by community foundations, collections of smaller funds donated by many individuals. The endowments are pooled for investment purposes, but grants are issued under the individual donors' names. Funds can be started for as little as $5,000, and contributions are deductible at the 50% limit.    There are several types of these funds. Most popular is the &quot;donor-advised&quot; fund, in which the donor continually recommends which organizations should receive grants from his fund. Community-foundation officials aren't compelled to follow those suggestions, but they usually do. &quot;I doubt we reject one percent&quot; of donor suggestions, says Herbert West, director of New York Community Trust, the nation's largest community foundation. Nearly half of the 900 funds that the trust currently manages are advised by donors.    In a &quot;designated fund,&quot; the donor specifies in advance that its income will go to a particular charitable institution. And a &quot;field-of-interest&quot; fund supports a specific activity without limiting the grants to specific institutions.    These funds are easy to create and maintain, because foundation officials who manage them file their tax reports and evaluate grant proposals for a small fee.    Frederick C. Smith, retired chairman of Huffy Corp., started a small private family foundation 25 years ago, but early this year he created a donor-advised fund with the Dayton Foundation, based in Dayton, Ohio. Mr. Smith says he plans to transfer the $350,000 in his private foundation to the fund. &quot;My feeling is that when my wife and I are no longer here, the administrative problems will be taken care of, and my sons can still advise on how the money is used,&quot; says the 71-year-old former executive.    Another alternative, the &quot;pass-through&quot; foundation, suits philanthropists who want to be even more actively involved in the giving process rather than leaving matters to a paid adviser.    As the name implies, all of the money donated to this kind of foundation is &quot;passed through&quot; to charities instead of invested in an endowment. These foundations are subject to the same restrictions on excess holdings and self dealing that apply to private foundations, but the donor can take the maximum tax deduction as long as all of the money he contributes each year is disbursed within 14 1/2 months.    That was an appealing situation for Samuel Gary, 61, a Colorado oilman. &quot;I wanted to participate very directly,&quot; he says, &quot;and I wanted to do it while I had some vitality and capacity to become involved. I didn't want to study it for 10 years, plan it for 10 years and then after I'm lowered in the ground have somebody else give it away.&quot;    Since 1976, Mr. Gary's Piton Foundation, named after a spike that mountain climbers use, has given away more than $30 million to low-income housing programs and other community development projects in its home state. The past few years have been difficult ones for the energy business, but Mr. Gary continues to fund the foundation and spends about 50% of his time on foundation business.    &quot;It would have made all the sense in the world to stop but I really got involved,&quot; he says. &quot;I just had no idea what effect people with a few bucks can have on the community. It's very exciting.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
