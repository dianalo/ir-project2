These funds invest in securities backed by adjustable-ratemortgages. Their aim? To tempt investors with 8%-plus yieldswhile keeping share-price volatility to a minimum.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Yields on the money funds are so pathetic these days thatthere's a huge pool of money that could be tempted away,&quot;says Don Phillips, editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicagonewsletter published by Morningstar Inc. &quot;There's no problemwith people going elsewhere, as long as they understand therisks.&quot;   Fund company executives and fund analysts say that theadjustable-rate mortgage funds could well be the next bigseller among mutual funds. Pilgrim Adjustable U.S. GovernmentSecurities Trust, which was rolled out Feb. 20, has alreadyraised $25 million. Keystone America Capital Preservation andIncome Fund is now being launched through Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   Hyperion Capital Management, which is headed by formerSalomon Brothers Inc. vice chairman Lewis Ranieri, is in theprocess of registering two funds with the Securities andExchange Commission. Other adjustable-rate mortgage funds aresaid to be in the works.   The new funds, all of which charge a sales commission,hope to copy the success of the Franklin Adjustable U.S.Government Securities Fund, which was launched in October1987. The Franklin fund, the first of its kind, has grownexplosively in the last 14 months, to $1.4 billion from $60million.   Some bond funds react sharply to changes in interestrates. That isn't the case with the Franklin fund, which buysbonds backed by adjustable-rate mortgages; the bonds areissued by government agencies such as the Federal NationalMortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   The fund's share price, which was initially set at $10,has ranged as high as $10.33 in 1988 and as low as $9.93 in1989. Recently, it has been hovering just above $10.   Why has the fund's share price held so steady? It has allto do with the nature of adjustable-rate mortgages. Becausethese mortgages have their rates adjusted as interest ratesmove up and down, the value of these mortgages isn't affectedmuch by interest rate changes. That has translated into lowshare price volatility for the Franklin fund-and thus madethe fund attractive to money fund investors.   &quot;I would like to think that, on a total return basis overtime, investors could earn 1.5% or 2% over money marketinstruments,&quot; says Jack Lemein, the fund's senior portfoliomanager.   Last year, that is just what happened. According to LipperAnalytical Services, the Franklin fund had a total return of9.6% in 1990, compared with 7.8% for the average money fund.   But the comparisons with money funds make some fundanalysts nervous. Mr. Phillips, the newsletter editor, sayshe sees nothing wrong with the concept of an adjustable-ratemortgage fund. But he worries that the investors may notrealize that these funds are more risky than a regular moneymarket fund.   &quot;The issue of how they're sold is the critical issue,&quot; hesays.   In recent years, mutual fund companies have devised anumber of different funds aimed at investors who aredissatisfied with money fund yields. In 1988 and 1989, thefund industry launched five so-called prime rate trusts,which invest in bank loans. The funds now boast combinedassets of $6 billion.   More recently, fund groups have been pushing short-termglobal bond funds, which buy bonds issued by both the U.S.Treasury and foreign governments. There are now 13 short-termglobal bond funds, with combined assets of over $10 billion.   John Rekenthaler, an analyst with Morningstar, reckons thenew adjustable-rate mortgage funds may prove to be a betterbet for investors than these other money fund look-alikes.And he thinks that the Franklin fund will soon have tocompete with a whole host of imitators.   &quot;When you attract $1 billion, people sit up and takenotice in the mutual fund area,&quot; says Mr. Rekenthaler. &quot;I betthere'll be 15 of these funds by year-end.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
