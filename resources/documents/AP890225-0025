Alexander told Walter F. Curran on Friday.   ``Notwithstanding family, notwithstanding friends, you mightleave; you have already done it once, and you might do it again,''Alexander said.   She noted that when the 46-year-old Boston man was caught at theCanadian border in Massena, N.Y., on Feb. 17, he had two passports,an international driver's license, a plane ticket to Germany,jewelry and the combination to a safe that has not been located.   Curran persuaded clients to invest money in his personal accountrather than through Dean Witter, promising them 20 percent interest,then converted the money to his own use, Assistant U.S. AttorneyPeter Mullin said.   Mullin said the broker also wrote six checks, each for $125,000to $500,000, on overdrawn bank accounts.   The prosecutor said the investment and bank frauds involved ``atotal dollar loss of between $2 million and $5 million.''   Defense attorney Thomas Troy said he would appeal Alexander'sdecision.   Curran is being held at the Middlesex County Jail. If convicted,he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail and a $500,000 fine.   Mullin said he could not predict when the case would come totrial, but said it could take months.</TEXT></DOC>
