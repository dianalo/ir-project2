(local exchange industryfaces a copper shortage)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gottesman, Jeffrey.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Local exchange carriers are attempting to increase revenues bydeveloping value-added features that employ embedded copperconnections to reach subscribers.andP;  Telephone companies (Telecos),at the same time, are increasing the use of digital loop carriersystems and fiber optics.andP;  The two factions need to communicate,or some telcos could end up with a shortage of copper pairs in thefeeder and distribution plant, making it difficult to providevalue-added services over electronically derived loops that copperpairs could easily handle.andP;  Security and surveillance systems areamong those that would be effected.andP;  Networks must be able tocarry all value-added features.andP;  Telcos should avoid switchingequipment that uses a unique signalling scheme or they could belocked into purchasing expensive equipment that is incompatiblewith its loop network.andP;  They should continue to provide somecopper pairs along routes served by loop electronics untilspecialized channel units become available for transporting newfeatures.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CablesFiber OpticsValue-Added CarriersTelecommunicationsTelecommunication systems.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
