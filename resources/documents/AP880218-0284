William Donald Schaefer signed into lawThursday bills giving top corporate officials greater protectionfrom lawsuits filed by disgruntled stockholders.   Schaefer had sought the legislation to enhance the state'sbusiness climate and to prevent some Maryland-based companies frommoving their headquarters to neighboring states that offer suchprotection to officers and directors.   As of Jan. 1, some 35 states had enacted laws offering somedegree of immunity from stockholder suits and are actively usingsuch laws to sell their states to companies consideringreincorporation, said Alan Rifkin, Schaefer's top legislative aide.   ``This says something to business,'' Schaefer said as he signedtwo identical bills passed at morning sessions of both the Houseand Senate.   ``It says we're interested in working together for the good ofthe state,'' he said.   The measures are specifically aimed at lawsuits brought bystockholders who believe a business decision by an officer ordirector was responsible for a drop in the value of a company'sstock.   Business leaders strongly supported the measures, tellinglawmakers that skyrocketing liability insurance premiums have madeit increasingly difficult to attract quality business people toserve on boards of directors.   The Schaefer administration introduced a bill for the samepurpose last year, but it was rejected by the House JudiciaryCommittee, reportedly because 1987's version did not givestockholders the right to reject such immunity for its officers anddirectors.   The bill signed Thursday requires formal ratification of theimmunity provision by stockholders. The law also specifies thatsuch protection does not apply to lawsuits brought by third parties.   Under the new law, which went into effect immediately afterSchaefer signed the bills, such immunity is lost when an officer ordirector receives an improper financial benefit or in casesinvolving deliberate dishonesty by a top corporate official.</TEXT></DOC>
