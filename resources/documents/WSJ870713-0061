Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who helped write the 1986 law, asserted Friday that the Immigration and Naturalization Service's public information campaign to acquaint employers with the statute threatens to detract from other enforcement initiatives and amounts to &quot;a dangerous misallocation of resources.&quot;    Rep. Schumer released a copy of an internal INS memo indicating that half of all the agency's investigative resources are to be used to make &quot;courtesy employer visits&quot; during the next year. &quot;Although the INS is to be commended for seeking to help employers&quot; understand the complicated new law, said Rep. Schumer in a letter to INS Commissioner Alan Nelson, other methods, such as advertising campaigns and toll-free telephone answering services, would be &quot;more efficient&quot; than door-to-door visits by investigators.    Other proponents of the law, including Rep. Romano Mazzoli (D., Ky.), a key sponsor, also have criticized the INS for failing to push for expanded budget resources to enforce the bill.    The INS has been under pressure from Western lawmakers and growers to delay implementation of sanctions for hiring and using illegal immigrants.    The agency hasn't provided a detailed breakdown of how manpower is to be used during the law's one-year phase-in period that began June 1. But it has previously announced plans to concentrate on educating employers, and has stressed the importance of voluntary compliance. It had no specific comment on Rep. Schumer's criticism. </TEXT></DOC>
