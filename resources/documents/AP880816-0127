Autoloans, because of their policies, went up to 17 percent _ so ourgreat factories began shutting down. Fuel costs jumped through theatmosphere _ more than doubling. Then people waited in gas lines aswell as unemployment lines.   Facts are stupid things _ stubborn things, I should say.   And then there was the misery index. That was an election yeargimmick they designed for the 1976 campaign _ they added theunemployment and inflation rates. And it came to 13.4 percent in1976, and they declared that our candidate, Jerry Ford, had noright to seek re-election with that kind of misery index.   But four years later, in the 1980 campaign, they didn't mentionthe misery index. Do you suppose it was because it was no longer13.4 percent? In those four years it had become almost 21 percent.   And last month, in Atlanta at their convention, there was againno mention of the misery index. Why? Because, right now, it's lessthan 9.2 percent.   Facts are stubborn things.   When we met in Detroit in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summerof discontent for America around the world. Our national defensehad been so weakened, the Soviet Union had begun to engage inreckless aggression, including the invasion and occupation ofAfghanistan.   The U.S. response to that was to forbid our athletes toparticipate in the 1980 Olympics and to try to pull the rug outfrom under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo.   And in those years, on any given day, we had military aircraftthat couldn't fly for lack of spare parts, and ships that couldn'tleave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew. Our embassyin Pakistan was burned to the ground, and the one in Iran wasstormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages. Theworld began to question the constancy and resolve of the UnitedStates. Our leaders answered, not that there was something wrongwith our government, but that our people were at fault because ofsome malaise.   Well, facts are stubborn things.   When our friends last month talked of unemployment, despair,hopelessness, economic weakness _ I wondered why on Earth they weretalking about 1978 instead of 1988.   Now, now we hear talk that it's time for a change. Well, ladiesand gentlemen, another friendly reminder: We are the change.   We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; wefocused on hope, not despair. We challenged the failed policies ofthe past, because we believed that a society is great, not becauseof promises made by its government, but only because of progressmade by its people. And that was our change.   We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, notraised. We cut the tax rates for the working folks of America. Weindexed taxes, and that stopped bracket creep which kicked averagewage-earners into higher tax brackets when they'd only received acost-of-living pay raise. And we initiated reform of the unfairnessin our tax system. And what do you know _ the top 5 percent ofearners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue atthe lower rates than they ever had before, and millions of earnersat the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any incometax at all.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
