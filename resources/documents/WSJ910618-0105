Those who favor the proposal assert, as this newspaperreported on May 20, that the goal is not to &quot;regulate themarket but rather to create a framework of understanding tobring about a stabilization of prices.&quot; In late May, theIranians sponsored an international conference that theirofficials called &quot;a first step toward fashioning andpromoting understanding among . . . producers, consumers andoil companies.&quot; In the same vein the Saudi oil ministerasserted in early May that his country's policy &quot;is toachieve a stable oil market, with oil prices which assure {a}reasonable return to the producer and predictability to theconsumer. . . . {A}s owners of at least a quarter of theworld's oil reserves, we have to take the long-term view.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Behind the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'drive for price &quot;stability&quot; is a well-grounded fear that theunderlying longer-term direction of oil prices is downward.Last June, just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, oil wastrading at $14 a barrel. After inflation, this approximatesthe price in 1973-74.   The oil shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-80 unleashed powerfulforces in the industrial world: a steady improvement inenergy efficiency (more miles per gallon; more lighting,heating and air conditioning per unit of electric power; moresteel per unit of energy, etc.); and a shift toward naturalgas, hydro-electric power, nuclear power and coal tosubstitute for oil. Oil's share of world energy consumption,which had been rising until 1973, has been declining almoststeadily since the mid-1970s. And more and more of theworld's oil has been coming from non-OPEC countries. That isgood news for the U.S. and the Western world -- helping OPECto regain its former power would be foolish andself-destructive.   In a vain attempt to arrest the downward drift in prices,Saudi Arabia spent the first half of the 1980s cutting itsoil output -- to not much more than 3 million barrels a dayin 1985 from almost 10 million barrels a day in 1979-81.Saudi oil export revenues plummeted to $24 billion in 1985from a peak of $116 billion in 1981. Toward the end of 1985,the Saudis entered the battle for market share, forcing OPECto resurrect its system of production quotas. It didn't work.Prices continued to decline as OPEC states &quot;cheated&quot; on theirquotas and underlying market forces restrained demand.   The Persian Gulf War has accelerated the trend away fromoil, and has further undermined OPEC cohesion. Germany andJapan, and, to a minor extent the U.S., have increased taxeson petroleum products, which will tend to restrain demand.The growing strength of the environmentalist movement hasspurred the trend toward greater energy efficiency and thereplacement of oil with abundant natural gas.   The prewar mini-oil shock reinforced the determination ofoil buyers to seek supplies from less volatile areas, i.e.,outside the Middle East. The pace of oil (and gas)exploration in the North Sea is at an all-time peak andsimilar activities are taking place in West Africa, SouthAmerica and in other Third World countries. The applicationof new technology has enhanced the probability of successfulfinds at lower cost as well as boosting recovery fromexisting wells. The downtrend in U.S. oil production since1986 was apparently arrested, at least temporarily, in 1990.In the second half of the year output exceeded its first halflevels and in the first quarter of this year production was1% greater than in the same period last year. Joint venturesbetween Western oil companies and Soviet producers should,over time, reverse the downtrend that began in 1988.   Probably the single most important factors depressing oilprices will be the financial troubles of the major MiddleEastern oil-exporting countries. Even before Iraq's invasionof Kuwait, Saudi Arabia's military budget was huge -- theequivalent of about 20% of its GNP in 1984-88. The war addedenormously to military outlays. Saudi Arabia's requests formany billions of dollars of U.S. military equipment, and itsplans to expand its armed forces, presage a major increase inits military outlays in the coming years.   Looming on the horizon is the re-entry of Kuwait and Iraqinto the oil markets. Both countries have vast petroleumreserves and pressing financial needs. They are even lesslikely than before to adhere to OPEC quotas. Iran, with itseconomy shattered by the revolution and its eight-year warwith Iraq has announced ambitious development goals. Higheroil exports are essential.   The $7 billion in loans Saudi Arabia has contracted overthe past few months from international and regional banksreflects the financial predicament faced by its government.They fear that higher prices will trigger strongcountervailing forces which will, within a few years, depressprices, i.e., a repetition of the boom and bust of the 1980s.Hence, the Saudi policy of attempting to enhance its oilrevenues not by higher prices, but by exporting a largervolume of oil.   The announced expansion of capacity by Abu Dhabi, Iran,Venezuela, Nigeria, as well as by smaller exporters, willsurely add to the downward pressure on prices. The historicalrecord shows that the greater the idle capacity the strongerthe tendency to &quot;cheat&quot; on quotas. Each of them hopes that itcan &quot;get away&quot; with a greater volume of sales withoutseriously depressing prices.   In view of these developments it is not hard to understandOPEC's desire to persuade the major oil consumers to agree toprice stabilization -- that is, to set prices higher than themarket would determine. In effect, OPEC is requesting thatthe oil-importing countries voluntarily subsidize them withmany billions of dollars. For the U.S. this would mean alarger trade deficit, higher inflation and slower economicgrowth. For the poorer oil-importing countries, the largemajority of the world's population, lower oil prices are awelcome blessing. It would be the height of folly for theU.S. and other industrialized countries to acquiesce to OPECprice-gouging.   ---   Mr. Kanovsky is a professor at Yeshiva University in NewYork and Bar Ilan University in Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
