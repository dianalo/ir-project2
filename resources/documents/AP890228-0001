Mrs. Aquino gave her warning during the third anniversarycelebration of her elite Presidential Security Group at thepresidential grounds.   In her speech, Mrs. Aquino cited the role of her security unit inthwarting the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt, the most serious of atleast six attempts against her government.   The failed coup, led by renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, leftabout 53 people dead and over 300 others seriously wounded. Mrs.Aquino's son, Benigno III, was injured and three of his securityguards were killed.   ``The August 28 coup failed because the Presidential SecurityGroup increased to an intolerable level the price the enemies offreedom would have to pay to take power in this country,'' Mrs.Aquino said. ``There would be no casual walk into the seat of powerfor them. The way would be littered with their shattered ambitions,their dead and our heroes.''   Honasan was captured in December 1987 but escaped the followingApril and has been in hiding since. Rumors swept the capital lastweek that he was recruiting followers for a new attempt.   Mrs. Aquino said the ability of her security men to withstandattacks had stalled several other attempts against her.   During one exercise, an eight-man security team staged a mockassault on a building. They charged from an armored personnelcarrier and entered the ground floor of a building supposedly seizedby renegade soldiers.   In another, hooded members of an assault team stormed a bus whichthe scenario said had been taken over by terrorists. Team membersused wooden ladders to scale the side of the bus, smashed thewindows with axes and pointed weapons inside.   A third exercise simulated an ambush on Mrs. Aquino's limousine.Troops simulated firing at the terrorists while loyal troops spedthe car to a helipad where a woman pretending to be the presidentwas helicoptered to safety.</TEXT></DOC>
