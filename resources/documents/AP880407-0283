(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan has imposedfishing sanctions against Japan in reprisal for alleged violationsof an international whale conservation accord.   In a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Reagan saidthe Commerce Department found that Japan has been granting permitsallowing the killing of its minke whales in the Antarctic forresearch purposes.   In Tokyo, an official from the Japanese Fisheries Agency saidhis government would seek to lift the sanctions through discussionswith U.S. authorities.   He said that the issue of fishing rights in U.S. waters hadnothing to do with the whaling accord.   ``The feeling is that we've been hit through some irrelevantissue,'' he said.   Invoking the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Actand the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, Reagan ordered theState Department to withhold 100 percent of the fishing privilegesthat would otherwise be available to Japan in an exclusive U.S.fishing zone.   Ken Cook, a spokesman for the U.S. affiliate of the WorldWildlife Fund, said Wednesday the announced fishing sanctions wouldhurt the Japanese to a degree. But he said the punitive measurescome too late to save any of the 300 minke whales that Japan plansto take in this year's research program.   In his letter to Wright, Reagan said that Japan had beengranting the whale-killing permits despite a 1987 InternationalWhaling Commission resolution against this practice.   That resolution recommended that Japan refrain from issuingfurther permits ``until uncertainties in their scientific researchproposals were resolved.''   The president's letter said the commission adopted a secondresolution since the finding of non-compliance by CommerceSecretary C. William Verity, in which the panel again recommendedthat Japan discontinue the practice.   Reagan said he had no evidence that Japan ``is bringing itswhaling activities into conformance'' with the whaling commissionrecommendations.   He said that because of this, the U.S. government would denyJapan's request to fish for 3,000 metric tons of sea snails and5,000 metric tons of Pacific whiting.   Reagan also told Wright that Japan will be ``barred from anyfuture allocations of fishing privileges for any other species,including Pacific cod, until the secretary of commerce determinesthat the situation has been corrected.'' He called the sanctions``the strongest possible'' under existing law.   Reagan, however, stopped short of moving against Japanese fishproducts imported into the United States, saying the steps he tookrepresented the ``most effective means of encouraging Japan toembrace the IWC conservation program.''</TEXT></DOC>
