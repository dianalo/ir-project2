<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0549 </DOCNO><TEXT>An eye-protection or equipment-filter device for protection from laserenergy is disclosed. The device may be in the form of a telescope, binoculars,goggles, constructed as part of equipment such as image intensifiersor range designators. Optical elements focus the waist of the beam withina nonlinear frequency-doubling crystal or nonlinear optical element orfiber. The nonlinear elements produce a harmonic outside the visiblespectrum in the case of crystals, or absorb the laser energy in the caseof nonlinear fibers. Embodiments include protectors for the human eyeas well as filters for sensitive machinery such as TV cameras, FLIR systemsor other imaging equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
