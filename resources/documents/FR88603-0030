Our actionsare intended to promote safe navigation in Hampton Roads by revising thepresent anchorage boundaries to conform with present navigational conditions,establishing new boundaries for the regulated navigation area, and clarifyingthe general provisions for both the anchorage grounds and the regulatednavigation area. The need for revision to the anchorage ground regulationsstems primarily from several construction and navigation improvement projectsthat have been completed, are in progress, or are planned for Hampton Roads.The need for revision to the regulated navigation area regulations stemsfrom a regulatory project being undertaken by Coast Guard Headquartersthat will revise all of the Coast Guard's anchorage regulations, and separateout those regulations that regulate vessel operations outside of specifiedanchorage grounds. Those provisions not related to specific anchorage groundsare being moved to Part 165. In addition to many substantative changes,we intend to remove out-dated and confusing language, redesignate anchoragesin a consecutive manner, and make the regulations easier to understand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before July 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be mailed to Commander (mpv), FifthCoast Guard District, Federal Building, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth,VA 23704-5004.

Anderson,Project Officer, Aids to Navigation and Waterways Management Branch, FifthCoast Guard District, and Commander R.J. Reining, Project Attorney, FifthCoast Guard District Legal Staff.<T3>Discussion: </T3>An advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which outlinedthe proposed changes to the anchorage regulations, was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 22, 1984 (49 FR 10678). That noticealerted the public to the need for certain changes in the existing regulationsand solicited comments and suggestions from the general public, users ofthese waters, and interested local and Federal agencies. Five commentswere received from the Corps of Engineers and various Navy sources. Thisnotice is based on that input, as well as other needs that have been identifiedsince the advanced notice was published through our regular consultationswith maritime interests.The objective of this proposal is to update the regulations and to makethem easier to understand. The proposed changes include redefining thegeographic boundaries to which both the anchorage and regulated navigationarea regulations apply, revising the explosives anchorage regulations,setting controls on the use of deep-draft anchorages, removing many restrictionsthat apply to most smaller vessels, relocating the Quarantine Anchorage,redesignating anchorages in a consecutive manner, and clarifying the generalregulations.There are also several construction and improvement projects taking palcein Hampton Roads that necessitate amending or removing some of the presentanchorages. The more important of these are the construction of the Interstate664 bridge-tunnel between Newport News and Suffolk, Virginia, and the deepeningand realignment of certain dredged channels in conjunction with the 55-footchannel deepening project. The U.S. Navy has also requested that a newanchorage area be established near Cape Henry for use during military exercises.Because of the large number of changes that are being proposed, the majorchanges will be discussed separately. Reference will be made to both thecurrent anchorage designations and the proposed redesignations.1. <T3>Geographic boundaries. </T3>The present regulations apply generallyto the Hampton Roads area, but there are no precisely defined geographicboundaries. The boundaries for the current Regulated Navigation Area (RNA)will be extended to include the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, the lower ChesapeakeBay south of a line between Hampton, Virginia and Cape Charles, Virginia,Hampton Roads proper, the James River east of the Route 17 highway bridge,and the various branches of the Elizabeth River in and around Norfolk,Virginia.2. <T3>Applicability. </T3>The current anchorage regulations prohibit anyvessel within the Hampton Roads area from anchoring outside of a designatedanchorage area. This prohibition extends even to the smallest pleasurevessels. Many of the designated anchorages also cover large areas unsuitablefor anchoring, either because of the depth of water, obstructions, or undergroundcables. We propose to eliminate most of the regulations applicable to vessels65 feet or less in length. Vessels over 65 feet in length and any vesselcarrying dangerous cargo or military explosives, as defined in these regulations,will be required to anchor in designated anchorage areas. However, allvessels, including vessels that are 65 feet or less in length, will beprohibited from anchoring in maintained channels and in the vicinity ofthe bridge-tunnels.Coast Guard Headquarters is currently working on a regulatory project thatwill revise all of the anchorage regulations in Part 110 of Title 33, Codeof Federal Regulations. That project will transfer the regulations controllingthe anchoring of vessels outside of established anchorages from Part 110to Part 165. In anticipation of that change, we are expanding the currentboundaries of the current Hampton Roads RNA and revising those regulationsto include restrictions on anchoring vessels outside of designated anchorages.This revision of the Hampton Roads RNA will also include a consolidationof other vessel control measures such as the naval aircraft carrier andliquified petroleum gas ship safety zone regulations.3. <T3>Deep-draft anchorages. </T3>At the request of the Corps of Engineerswe have proposed new restrictions on the use of the principal deep-draftanchorages. These restrictions are based primarily on vessel length anddraft. They also vary depending upon the size, depth, and location of theparticular anchorage. Our purpose is to ensure that these anchorages areavailable for and used only by those vessels that actually require deeperwater.4. <T3>Anchorage F. </T3>Because the U.S. Navy no longer requires this anchoragefor mooring explosives laden barges, this anchorage will be discontinued.Those portions of Anchorage F that will not be lost to the I-664 bridge-tunnelwill be incorporated into Anchorages I, J, and K.5. <T3>Explosives Anchorage. </T3>Anchorage F-1 will be discontinued as anexplosive anchorage. It will be incorporated into new Anchorage E, a generalcommercial anchorage. Because we believe there is a need to maintain aseparate explosives anchorage for commercial vessels, a new explosivesanchorage will be designated at the eastern and of Anchorage E, which islocated in lower Chesapeake Bay. This location is accessible to large ships.It is located in a semi-protected area that is removed from populated areasand other anchorages.6. <T3>Explosives and dangerous cargoes. </T3>This proposal identifies vesselsthat are required to use the explosives anchorage by defining explosivesand other dangerous cargoes in terms consistent with current hazardousmaterial regulations.7. <T3>Quarantine Anchorage. </T3>The Quarantine Anchorage will be relocatedfrom old Anchorage A to new Anchorage K. At present, this anchorage isseldom used for quarantine purposes. It is a naturally deep and well-locatedanchorage that is better suited for other purposes. The deep waters inAnchorage F will be used as the primary deep-draft commercial anchoragein Hampton Roads. Moving the Quarantine Anchorage to Anchorage K will stillprovide vessels with an accessible quarantine anchorage.8. <T3>Naval Anchorage G (formerly anchorage B). </T3>The proposal adds newrequirements for handling of explosives in Anchorage G. New minimum separationdistances between explosives-laden vessels and the Navy barge mooring facility,other vessels at anchor, and navigation channels are proposed. This proposalis based on standards set by the Department of Defense for military vessels.9. <T3>Naval Anchorage A. </T3>At the request of the U.S. Navy, a new anchoragenear Cape Henry south of the main ship channel is included in the proposal.This anchorage will be used by military and military support vessels engagedin military exercises at Fort Story.10. <T3>Anchorage U (formerly Anchorage N-1). </T3>This anchorage is traditionallyused by vessels 65 feet or less in length. Because of the scenic locationof this anchorage, regulations on its use will continue.11. <T3>Anchorage R and S (formerly anchorage P). </T3>Since Anchorage P crossesthe entry channel to the Pinners Point piers and encompasses area unsuitablefor anchoring, it is being divided into two anchorages.12. <T3>Anchorages G-1, G-2, J-1, J-2, M, Q, S-1 and S-2. </T3>These anchoragesare being eliminated, since the principal users, shallow draft vessels,will no longer be required to anchor in designated anchorages. Also, portionsof the areas included in these anchorages are unsuitable for anchoringvessels.13. <T3>Channel realignments. </T3>Dredging activities to deepen and realignNewport News Channel and Norfolk Harbor Entrance Reach require adjustmentsto the boundaries of Anchorages G, H, J, and K to conform to the new deeperchannels. The shift of these channels is minor and has virtually no effectupon the amount of space available for anchoring vessels.14. <T3>Anchorage T-6. </T3>This anchorage is being eliminated. It was establishedfor vessels involved with the construction of piers at the Norfolk NavalBase, and is no longer needed for that purpose.15. <T3>Fairway for shallow-draft vessels and tows. </T3>The proposal eliminatesthe fairway that extends from Norfolk Harbor Reach near buoy ``10'' toNewport News Channel near buoy ``9.'' This fairway can be better used asan anchorage. Its elimination will not significantly affect the operationof vessels that now use it.16. <T3>Protection of bridge-tunnels. </T3>The boundaries of the anchoragesadjacent to the I-664 bridge-tunnel are being amended so they are no closerthan 500 yards to the bridge-tunnel. No vessels will be allowed to anchorwithin this 500 yard buffer zone. The buffer zone should minimize the possibilityof damage to the bridge by vessels in adjacent anchorages that drag theiranchors. A similar buffer zone is being created for the Chesapeake BayBridge Tunnel.17. <T3>Redesignation of anchorages. </T3>All of the anchorages have been renamed.The anchorages have been lettered in a consecutive manner starting at theoutermost anchorage.18. <T3>Anchorage permits. </T3>The proposal includes new regulations thatallow the Captain of the Port to issue permits to vessels for remainingin an anchorage for extended periods.19.<T3> Speed limit regulations.</T3> The speed limit regulations governingthe Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River and Fishermans Cove (NorthwestBranch of Little Creek) in 33 CFR 162.55 and 162.60 have been consolidatedinto the Regulated Navigation Area regulations.20. <T3>Aircraft carrier and LPG carrier safety zone regulations.</T3> Thesafety zone regulations governing the movements on aircraft carriers andLPG carriers in 33 CFR 165.505 and 165.506 have been consolidated intothe Regulated Navigation Area regulations. The regulations on aircraftcarrier movements have been expanded to cover the movement of other largenaval vessels, such as Helicopter Landing Ships, that have limited maneuverabilityin confined waters.21. <T3>Thimble Shoal Channel Restrictions.</T3> Due to the large volume ofvessel traffic in the lower Chesapeake Bay, the need arose, as a matterof safety, to restrict the use of Thimble Shoal Channel. To meet this need,the Thimble Shoal North and South Auxiliary Channels were designated foruse by those vessels with drafts of 25 feet and less. Comments receivedfrom the Virginia Pilots Association during Coast Guard analysis indicateda desire to have the limits of Thimble Shoal Auxiliary Channels extended.This proposal enlarges the size of these channels. Vessel safety shouldbe enhanced by this measure. In addition, the Coast Guard's analysis indicateda need to relocate the buoys in Thimble Shoal Channel. (<T4>Note:</T4> This proposal indicates the locations where the buoys willbe located if the proposal is adopted, not current locations of the buoys.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification </ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under Department ofTransportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimalthat a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. A particular effort hasbeen made to eliminate as many of the current regulations as possible toreduced the burden on commercial and recreational vessel operators. Asa result, anchoring in most of the Hampton Roads' area is less restrictivethan before; smaller vessels are free to anchor in many more areas thanthey were previously permitted. The only adverse effect expected from thisregulation is the loss of the use of a small portion of the medium andshallow depth anchorage ground available in Hampton Roads. This resultsfrom the construction of the bridge-tunnel. Sufficient anchorage groundwill be available for vessels that, in the past, have used the anchoragegrounds that will be discontinued. Since the impact of this proposal isexpected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, itwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>33 CFR Part 110Anchorage grounds.33 CFR Part 162Navigation (water), Waterways.33 DFR Part 165Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Security measures, Vessels,Waterways.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Title33, Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 110_ANCHORAGE REGULATIONS</ITAG>1.
