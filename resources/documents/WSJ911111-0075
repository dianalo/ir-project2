Kaczorowski (&quot;The 15,000-Year Heat Wave,&quot;Letters to the Editor, Oct. 21) reveals a fundamentalignorance of the scope of research into greenhouse warming.   No reputable scientist &quot;restrict{s} the discussion ofearth-warming to the past 100 or so years. . . .&quot; In aneffort to understand the effects of elevated carbon-dioxidelevels, we have constructed general climate models datingback over 100 million years, and detailed ones for morerecent periods such as the Pliocene Optimum (4.3 million to3.3 million years ago) and the Eemian Interglacial (125,000years ago). The correlation between higher C02 levels andhigher temperatures during those periods is well established,and can be used to predict both the extent and the rate ofgreenhouse warming.</LP><TEXT>   This brings us to the more serious error in Mr.Kaczorowski's reasoning. He supposes that since periodicwarming and cooling trends are an established fact of life,&quot;the debate about whether or not the combustion of fossilfuels will speed this process by a few tens of years seemsfoolish.&quot;   While the earth's biotic systems are both flexible andadaptable, flexibility and adaptability can be overwhelmed bytoo rapid a rate of change. An analogy, if one is needed, canbe made to aeroembolisms, commonly known as &quot;the bends,&quot;which can kill a deep-sea diver who ascends too rapidly. Amore pertinent illustration is that of forests that migrate,much like animals, in accordance with changing climatepatterns. The California redwoods, for example, ranged muchfarther south during the last ice age, and moved back to thenorth as temperatures moderated. If, however, temperatureshad risen as fast as they are rising currently, the redwoodswould have died off in Southern California long before theyhad had time to establish themselves in northern California.In other words, they would be extinct today.   Many species will face similar difficulties, compounded bythe major disruptions of biological ranges caused by humanactivity. To return to the redwood example, large gaps inthat species' natural habitat as a result of logging wouldslow any possible northward migration by as much as a centuryor two. The time required by humans to adjust to rapidlyrising sea levels, the inundation of coastal plains, the lossof agricultural productivity, greater energy demands,fresh-water shortages and many other impacts can hardly beoverestimated. We are hardly quibbling over trifles when weattempt to slow greenhouse warming by the &quot;few tens of years&quot;that Mr. Kaczorowski begrudges us.   Lawrence Livermore   Berkeley, Calif.   ---   Concerning your Oct. 23 article &quot;Panel Sees OzoneThinning, Intensifying Political Heat&quot; and theenvironmentalists' perceived lack of progress in reversingthe problem: the reason is the environmentalists have losttheir credibility. They may be absolutely right about theozone, but how can we believe them? Many of them are the sameones who preached that if oil exploration were permitted onthe North Slope of Alaska, the &quot;tender tundra&quot; would bedestroyed, the elk population would be decimated, etc. Whiletime has proved that none of these dire predictions occurred,the environmentalists are denying history and again preachingno exploration on the North Slope because of the &quot;tendertundra,&quot; elk, etc.   How can we believe them when we find that the rain forestsof Brazil would have vanished long ago if the rate ofdestruction were as fast as they reported?   The list of sky-is-falling stories goes on and on. Itreally would be a shame if one of the stories was right butno one listened.   J.E. Garrett   Dallas</TEXT></DOC>
