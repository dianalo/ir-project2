Bush on Thursday signed the toughest of the provisions: arequirement for an independent inspector general to monitor theactivities of the Central Intelligence Agency.   Creation of the office, similar to oversight posts at othergovernment agencies that review federal programs and ferret outabuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing a reported $25billion to $30 billion for U.S. intelligence activities for thecoming year.   Bush last week approved a foreign aid bill containing a ban onuse of U.S. money to entice foreign governments into carrying outpolicies banned by U.S. law. The provision is a reaction toPresident Reagan's apparent use of aid money as a reward toHonduras for harboring the Contras in its territory along theNicaraguan border.   Bush also is expected to sign a measure providing criminalpenalties for sales of weapons to terrorist countries, such as thearms-for-hostages deal with Iran.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who chaired the House Iran-Contrainvestigating panel, said its primary finding was that the affairstemmed not from a failure of the law, but a failure of individualsto obey it.   ``Congress could not legislate fidelity to the law,'' he said.   Nonetheless, the committees suggested a series of changes thatwould make it less likely that abuses could occur.   Meanwhile, Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh was quotedin today's Washington Post as saying the Bush administrationdecided to adopt a stricter policy on releasing classifiedinformation for Iran-Contra trials after former Reagan White Houseaide Oliver North was convicted in May for his role in the affair.   Walsh said one consequence of the new policy was theadministration's decision to block disclosure of classifieddocuments in the trial of former CIA official Joseph F. Fernandez,the Post said. That move led to the dismissal of the Fernandez caselast week.   Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee wrote AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh today asking for an explanation on why heblocked disclosure in the Fernandez case.   ``Specifically, the committee would like to know theintelligence information of concern, the probability it would havebeen disclosed and the possible consequences of its disclosures,''said Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the committee, andSen. William S. Cohen of Maine, its senior Republican.   The changes passed in the waning hours of this year'scongressional session ``were not unimportant provisions,'' Hamiltonsaid. Other recommendations, mostly dealing with how the presidentnotifies Congress of covert operations overseas, will be hammeredout next year and may be more difficult to enact, he said.   Bush accepted the changes despite protests that theyunnecessarily tie his hands in carrying out foreign policy and amidcautionary statements that he will resist any effort by Congress touse the new authority to ``micromanage'' the administration'sactivities.   Bush said the new inspector general post ``could impair theability of the CIA to collect vitally needed intelligenceinformation by creating a perception that confidentiality cannot beguaranteed.''   The CIA ``must be able to assure foreign individuals andorganizations that their identities, the fact of their associationwith the United States, and the information they provide are notsubject to exposure,'' said Bush, himself a former CIA director.   CIA Director William Webster has said that while the provisioncould damage confidence of foreign intelligence services in U.S.ability to keep secrets, he would seek to rebuild safeguardsagainst compromising intelligence sources and methods.   Bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision thatwould let the CIA director quash any inspector general'sinvestigation he believed might compromise national security.   The inspector general would be appointed by the president andconfirmed by the Senate, and the auditor's reports would beavailable to the House and Senate committees that oversee U.S.intelligence.   Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by theCIA director and reports only to him. That arrangement has causedfriction with the House ntelligence Committee, which has beendenied access to some reports.   The congressional Iran-Contra investigators said the agency'sinspector general lacked independence and didn't have ``themanpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover arms-for-hostagestransactions or the diversion of profits to Nicaragua's Contrarebels.   The implication was that as an underling of former CIA DirectorWilliam Casey, who was deeply involved in the affair, the inspectorgeneral lacked the muscle to detect or report Iran-Contra abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
