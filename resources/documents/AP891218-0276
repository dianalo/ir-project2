Lewis on Mondaywas spared a prison term for stock manipulation by a federal judgewho ordered him to work in a drug rehabilitation clinic, saying``your skills should not be wasted.''   Lewis, 50, a prominent Wall Street veteran whose downfallresulted indirectly from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal,was placed on three years probation and fined $250,000 afterpleading guilty to three counts for illegally inflating the priceof Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in May 1986.   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe also fined Lewis' firm,S.B. Lewis andamp; Co., $400,000 for violating federal securities laws.   Lewis faced up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $750,000 andthe firm a maximum $1 million fine for the manipulation, whichraised the value of Fireman's Fund stock immediately before a Lewisclient, American Express Co., sold a large amount of shares in anew public offering.   American Express was never charged, and there is no proof thatit or Lewis profited from the manipulation. But under federalsecurities laws, profit is not necessary for a crime to have beencommitted.   ``I recognize my conduct was wrong,'' Lewis told the court.``For this I am deeply sorry.''   He said he was not motivated by greed but by a desire to punishrival speculators attempting to bid down the price of Fireman'sFund. The government said his version of events was ``simply notsupported by the facts.''   Lewis pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court in August,reversing his assertions of innocence nine months after he wasindicted.   The charges stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea by former LosAngeles stockbroker Boyd Jefferies, who testified against severalWall Street figures in the government's criminal fraud crackdown.   Jefferies was implicated in the scandal by Boesky, the convictedinside trader now in a New York halfway house finishing athree-year prison term.   Lewis was ordered to work 40 hours a week for one year at DaytopVillage, a Manhattan-based drug rehabilitation clinic. He must work20 hours a week at the clinic in the second and third years of hisprobation. Lewis will work at Daytop as an executive consultant,Arkin said.   ``You should be sentenced in such a manner that your skillsshould not be wasted,'' Lowe said.   But she added: ``I firmly believe your actions undermined theintegrity of (the financial) system. I have no problem saying thatshould not be tolerated or go unpunished.''   Prosecutors alleged Lewis requested two of Jefferies' employeesto buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on May 8, 1986,in an attempt to drive its price up 12{ cents to $38 a share.   The indictment also accused Lewis of promising to reimburse theJefferies employees for any losses and of hiding his role throughphony records.   On May 9, 1986, American Express announced it would sell 8million shares of its 41 percent owned Fireman's Fund at $41.50 ashare, a new stock offering that had been widely expected.   Prosecutors said American Express made $88 million from the salebut they never offered evidence that any of that profit was taintedby what Lewis did.   Lewis said he manipulated the stock price to foil``short-sellers'' in Fireman's Fund stock. Short-sellers arespeculators who sell borrowed stock to push down the value,repurchase it at a cheaper price, return the borrowed shares to thelender and pocket the difference as profit.   The Securities and Exchange Commission in September 1988 bannedshort-selling in new stock offerings like that of Fireman's Fund,exactly the type of activity Lewis claimed he'd tried to thwart.Stock prices tend to fall after announcement of a new issue, whichdilutes the stock's value.   Vincent DiBlasi, attorney for S.B. Lewis andamp; Co., said the firmhad fired all but seven of 44 employees and is liquidating.   Lowe said the firm's demise sends ``the appropriate message tothe investment community that if a company engages in this type ofactivity it will no longer be around.''   ``In other words the death of a company is as final as the deathof a human being,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
