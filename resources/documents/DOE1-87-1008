Australia's three principal transport fuels (gasoline,jet fuel and automotive diesel fuel) can be produced in proportions consistentwith future demand patterns. The optimum refining scheme involves a singlehigh severity hydrotreatment of the coal liquid, followed by distillationand naphtha reforming. The cost of refining (excluding liquefaction costs)is approx. 8 c/L greater than refining costs for a light, low sulfurpetroleum crude. The high cost of the liquefaction process, rather thanthe cost of refining, is the main factor inhibiting commercial productionof liquid fuels from coal.</TEXT></DOC>
