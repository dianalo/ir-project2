CohenStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DARTA DHTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)RETAILING (RET) </IN><TEXT>   Dart Group Corp., spurned in a previous attempt to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp., proposed buying the Minneapolis-based retailer in a transaction Dart valued at more than $65 a share, or about $6 billion.    It wasn't immediately clear how Dayton Hudson would respond. The company said Dart's proposal &quot;will be considered by our board of directors in due course&quot; and that &quot;no one should assume that any transaction will result.&quot;    But Dayton Hudson, the nation's sixth-largest retailer, went to great lengths in June to avoid a takeover threat by Dart and said at the time that it wasn't interested in being acquired by the discount retailer. Industry analysts have been speculating for some time that Dayton Hudson would restructure -- possibly by shedding a unit or recapitalizing -- in an effort to fend off the Haft family of Washington, D.C., which controls Dart.    &quot;Dayton Hudson likes being independent,&quot; said Edward Weller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. Mr. Weller said he isn't sure how the company would resist the Hafts' advances. But, he added, &quot;Numerous managements have shown an aversion to becoming a subsidiary of Dart.&quot;    The move by the Haft family, which has gained a reputation in recent years as a corporate raider, had been widely anticipated. As previously reported, Landover, Md.-based Dart sought regulatory clearance in July to buy a controlling interest in Dayton Hudson after being rebuffed by its target.    Dart's proposal, which it made public after the market closed yesterday, seemed more like an opening bid than a firm offer. In a three-page letter outlining the plan for Dayton Hudson's board, the Hafts said all terms of its offer were negotiable.    Robert Haft, Dart's president, said in an interview that Dart hadn't yet discussed its proposal with Dayton Hudson. However, he added, &quot;We look forward to the opportunity to work with them. We want to own this company.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Dayton Hudson shares closed yesterday at $52.875 a share, up 50 cents. But in trading through Jefferies andamp; Co. in the third market after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, traders bid as much as $62 a share for Dayton Hudson shares.    Dart, which holds slightly less than a 5% stake in Dayton Hudson, proposed paying $65 a share for slightly more than 90% of Dayton Hudson's shares outstanding and giving an equity interest in the new company for the roughly 5% of the shares remaining. Dart valued its offer at more than $65 a share. Dayton Hudson has 97.4 million shares outstanding.    To illustrate the seriousness of its interest, Dart said that if its bid is ultimately rejected, it will donate any profit it might reap from its Dayton Hudson stake to charities in Minnesota.    The comment was apparently designed to counter what had been the centerpiece of Dayton Hudson's early defense strategy. As previously reported, the company won swift legislative approval of a tough new anti-takeover law in June, partly because of fears that an acquisition by the Hafts would cut off the flow of charitable contributions from the company's coffers.    Despite their stated desire to acquire a major retailer, the Hafts also have a reputation for being more interested in putting companies in play, and making money on stakes they hold in their targets, rather than in actually buying and operating a company. But Mr. Haft said, &quot;Our (Dayton Hudson) shares are not for sale.&quot;    While some traders said that the $65-a-share price was a good one, most doubted that the proposal could succeed.    &quot;There's going to be a lot of blood here. These guys don't want to go,&quot; said one trader, referring to Dayton Hudson management. Another Wall Street trader said Dart may, at best, &quot;have a shot at forcing the company to restructure.&quot;    Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman, has said that the company wouldn't go private, sell units or seek a friendly suitor to thwart the Hafts. But in testimony before the Minnesota legislature in June, he didn't rule out restructuring Dayton Hudson some other way or paying a premium known as &quot;greenmail&quot; to buy back the company's shares from a hostile bidder.    Market sources said that if Dart's offer is rejected, the group wouldn't be likely to make a hostile tender offer for Dayton Hudson. For one thing, the company has a so-called poison pill, which is designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.    For another, the anti-takeover statute in Minnesota, where Dayton Hudson is incorporated, is one of the toughest in the country. Under the law, a buyer can't accumulate more than 20% of the shares and retain voting rights without first receiving the consent of the target company's shareholders.    Mr. Haft said he didn't view the Minnesota law as a deterrent. But he declined to comment on what Dart would do if Dayton Hudson rejects its proposal.    Details of Dart's financing were sketchy. Mr. Haft said his family would put up a &quot;substantial&quot; amount of cash, which he declined to quantify, and that efforts to arrange bank and other financing already had begun.    In addition, Dart said its investment banker, PaineWebber Inc., was &quot;highly confident&quot; it could arrange the unsecured and subordinated debt financing necessary for the offer. That would likely come from the sale of high-risk, high-yield securities known as &quot;junk bonds.&quot; PaineWebber officials declined to comment on terms of financing or other details.    Moreover, Dart is using as its investment banker a firm that isn't accustomed to handling buy-outs as large as the Dayton Hudson proposal. If completed, the takeover of Dayton Hudson would be one of the largest ever.    Mr. Haft maintained that a merger of Dayton Hudson and an affiliate of Dart would be in the best interest of Dayton Hudson stockholders, employees and customers. He said his family, which operates the Crown Books chain of discount bookstores and the Trak Auto chain of automotive supplies stores, could &quot;add strategic ideas and marketing ideas&quot; to make Dayton Hudson &quot;an even more valuable company.&quot;    He also said he believes his family could be &quot;instrumental&quot; in helping to turn around Dayton Hudson's Mervyn's department store unit, which has been depressed by marketing problems.    The Hafts, who also have interests in real estate, have been trying for some time to make a big acquisition. Earlier this year, they made a similar proposal to Supermarkets General Corp., but the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer went private in a leveraged buy-out instead. The Hafts also tried unsuccessfully to acquire Oakland, Calif.-based Safeway Stores Inc., a retail food chain.    ---                     The Hafts' Targets    Feb. 1985   May Department Stores.
