Capt. Edward J. Silva Jr., the chief San Diego harbor pilot whowill steer the damaged tanker to a National Steel and ShipbuildingCo. dock, is a member of the sometimes militant environmental groupGreenpeace.   Silva is a critic of many oil company maritime policies, but onTuesday, his primary focus will be to bring the crippled Valdezsafely into port. The ship that caused the nation's worst oil spillwas towed from Alaska by tugs, but for greater maneuverability Silvawill bring it through the bay under its own power.   Exxon officials said they have no problems with Silva'smembership in Greenpeace.   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' said Carrie Chassin, aspokeswoman for Exxon Shipping Co. ``There are people in Exxon whobelong to the Sierra Club. I'm sure he'll drive that ship in asprofessionally as he knows how.''   Silva, a seaman for 42 years, said he comes from a family ofmariners _ his grandfather and father also were sailors _ and hisconcern for the oceanic environment developed naturally.   He believes the risk of oil spills has increased with crewreductions in recent years on the more sophisticated tankers.   ``You can build the strongest ship in the world but if you don'tdo the job right and you have an accident, you're going to have anoil spill, period,'' Silva said. ``Where you're going to stop it isby making sure the people operating these ships are operating themsafely and have enough people to do the job.''   The former captain of the Valdez has been accused of drinking onthe job.   Silva also said he believes the Valdez accident would never haveoccurred if a qualified pilot had been aboard to guide the shipthrough the sound. The pilot who had helped guide the ship throughPrince William Sound had left it a few miles before the accidentoccurred March 24, as regulations allowed.   ``I may be biased, but there should have been an Alaskan pilot onboard,'' Silva said. ``They're more familiar with the area. Iguarantee you if there had been one on, it wouldn't have happened.''   Silva said the Coast Guard will take him out to the Valdez byhelicopter Monday so he can familiarize himself with the ship andits handling.   ``Given that the ship is damaged, I'm not really sure how it'sgoing to handle,'' he said. ``Suppose there is a jagged piece ofsteel down there someplace I don't know about? It could have aneffect on how the ship steers.''   ``I'm doing it just to be absolutely certain in my own mind ...that the ship can handle OK,'' he said.   ``There's no one more interested in trying to keep this areaclean than I am, believe me.''</TEXT></DOC>
