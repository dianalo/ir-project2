It was the second Soviet Central Asian republic toexplode in violence in recent weeks.   Tass said people were killed but did not gave a figure.   The official news agnecy said the rioting began Friday night inNovy Uzen, a town in western Kazakhstan about 1,050 miles southeastof Moscow known for its oil and gas processing plants.   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Sunday the unrestbegan with a fight between two gangs at a discotheque. Theyoverturned kiosks, smashed windows and doors and set several cars onfire, the newspaper said.   The Tass dispatch indicated the disturbances have gone on despitepolice attempts to restore order.   ``Outrageous elements have formed groups, armed with sticks,steel rods and stones. They are staging pogroms in houses, storesand administrative buildings and are attacking passers-by in housingdevelopments and on city streets,'' Tass said.   The gangs, also using guns and firebombs, tried to seize thepolice station, water supply systems and other vital facilities inthe city, the news agency reported. Public transport has beenparalyzed, and some businesses have had to close.   In neighboring Uzbekistan, rioting targeted at an ethnicminority, the Meskhi Turks, began in late May, and about 100 peoplewere killed. On Monday, authorities pledged to create 200,000 jobs,clean up polluting factories and grow more food in that region tostem the economic and environmental problems behind the unrest.   Kazakhstan, where the new unrest flared, was the scene of thefirst major outbreak of ethnic violence under President Mikhail S.Gorbachev. Crowds rioted in December 1986 in the republican capital,Alma Ata, after the leader of the local Communist Party, an ethnicKazakh, was replaced by an ethnic Russian. Two people were killed.   There was no indication, however, that ethnic factors were behindthe Novy Uzen rioting.   Komsomolskaya Pravda traced the trouble to economic factors and``social tension.'' It said the rampaging youths demand an end torationing. Because of shortages, rationing has been imposed in manyparts of the Soviet Union on meat, butter and sugar.   The youths also demanded closure of cooperatives, the privatebusinesses formed under Gorbachev's economic reforms, the newspapersaid. They believe cooperatives have caused food shortages anddriven up prices, it said.   The gangs also said workers brought into the region make moremoney and are taking jobs that could go to local youths, thenewspaper said.   Soviet Central Asia, with the highest birthrate in the country,has a labor surplus and job shortage.   The Communist Party daily Pravda, quoting an Uzbekistangovernment commission report, said food processing plants and sewingfactories would be opened, in administrative buildings if necessary,to provide 200,000 new jobs in the troubled Fergana Valley by theend of 1990.   It said unspecified steps would be taken to end the concentrationon cotton production. Some activists charge that cotton production,boosted by huge amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, ispoisoning the land and leading to malnutrition in a republic onceknown for its fruits and vegetables.   ``This is very positive, but they had to think about it muchearlier,'' said the leader of the Uzbek grass-roots movement Berlik,Abdurakhim Pulatov.   Pulatov, in a telephone interview from Tashkent, the Uzbekistancapital, said he did not believe 200,000 jobs could be created soquickly.   Rioting that broke out in the area pitted ethnic Uzbeks againstthe Meskhi minority, which was forcibly resettled to the region fromthe southern republic of Georgia by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in1944.   Authorities and residents differ on the reasons for the arson andmurder rampage that prompted the dispatch of 9,000 soldiers andevacuation of about 16,000 Meskhi Turks.   Some news reports have blamed Berlik for the violence, butPulatov rejected the charge.</TEXT></DOC>
