DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department acknowledged Friday itwas in such a rush to indict Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on drugcharges that it may not have followed its own rules for making surestate secrets would not be disclosed in court.   However, said department spokesman David Runkel, ``We believethere is a strong case against General Noreiga and that case can besuccessfully brought to trial.''   Some legal experts have said there could be problems in tryingNoriega because he would seek to use classified informationstemming from his past cooperation with the Central IntelligenceAgency.   Runkel said on Tuesday that such concerns ``have been grosslyexaggerated.''   At a press briefing on Friday, he told reporters that thedepartment may not have followed its usual policy of reviewing, indrawing up an indictment, any classified documents that might beused in a trial.   ``I had been informed that that was the policy that had in factbeen followed in this case,'' he told reporters.   ``It now appears that there was some rush to draw up the Noriegaindictment and those guidelines may not have been completelyfollowed,'' he said.   Runkel declined to elaborate on the nature of the ``rush'' andsaid, ``I haven't determined the reason'' for it.   He said the department's decision to review the nationalsecurity issues was an outgrowth of a Dec. 14 meeting ofprosecutors in the case with representatives of the DrugEnforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and CIA.   That meeting was called to discuss drug indictments againstNoriega in Miami and Tampa, Fla., and a decision was made toproceed with the Miami case, Runkel said.   Noriega reportedly worked closely with the CIA and the Pentagonwhile he served as the head of Panama's military intelligenceservice and after he became commander in chief in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
