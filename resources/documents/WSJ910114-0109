United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellarmet Saddam Hussein in Baghdad yesterday, just two days beforethe U.N.'s Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.He gave no indication that there was any breakthrough in the3 1/2-hour meeting.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;God only knows if there will be peace or war in theGulf,&quot; Mr. Perez de Cuellar told reporters as he leftBaghdad, on his way to report to members of the U.N. SecurityCouncil.   U.S. officials said that Iraq has shown in the past thatit holds Mr. Perez de Cuellar in low regard, so they weren'toptimistic that Saddam Hussein would offer him anycompromises. And Arab diplomats in Washington said theyconsidered today's meeting of Iraq's legislature a far morelikely forum for Saddam Hussein to unveil a final diplomaticmaneuver in the Persian Gulf crisis.   The Iraqi leader over the weekend scheduled the emergencymeeting of the legislature, which he occasionally has used totake responsibility for actions he found risky ordistasteful.   As a result, Arab diplomats speculate that he might layout some vague withdrawal offer linking a promised withdrawalfrom Kuwait with international action on the rights ofPalestinians, thereby making it harder for President Bush tolaunch a war.   President Bush over the weekend offered Iraq a slimopening for diplomatic moves. He continued to insist that hewon't accept any &quot;linkage&quot; between an Iraqi withdrawal fromKuwait and the convening of an international Middle Eastpeace conference to address the future of Israeli-occupiedPalestinian lands, as Saddam Hussein has insisted. But healso said the U.S. hasn't traditionally opposed aninternational peace conference and that &quot;I guess I'd say itdepends how it's put forward.&quot;   The president said that in a speech at the U.N. last fall,he spoke out in favor of a plan to resolve the Palestinianquestion and didn't rule out an international conference onthe Middle East under the right conditions. That kind ofambiguous American position leaves open at least the chancefor a formula that might give Saddam Hussein a diplomaticpretext for withdrawal without forcing Mr. Bush to back awayfrom his &quot;no linkage&quot; position.   Still, one senior American official yesterday said heconsidered it more likely that, rather than offer some11th-hour compromise, Saddam Hussein will use the legislativesession to put more of a &quot;hard edge&quot; on Iraq's position onthe eve of Tuesday's deadline.   In fact, American officials are concerned about thepossibility that Iraq, seeing an attack on its forces asinevitable, may move to rally Arab support by launching apre-emptive strike on Israel. However, U.S. analysts don'tthink such an attack is likely, because it would open therisk of enormous American and Israeli military strikeswithout any guarantees of breaking up the American alliancewith Arab states opposed to Iraq.   As the fears of war escalated, Western embassies inBaghdad were vacated.   The rhetoric coming from Iraq yesterday gave no suggestionthat Saddam Hussein is preparing an artful compromise. In amessage read on Baghdad Radio, the Iraqi leader againreferred to Kuwait as Iraq's new, 19th province, and heimplied again a willingness to fight to keep it.   &quot;Our 19th province has become a battlefield for theshowdown in which the {Arab} nation will be triumphant,&quot;Saddam Hussein said in the broadcast. In response to anappeal over the weekend from Syrian leader Hafez Assad thatIraq withdraw from Kuwait to prevent a war, the Iraqi leaderurged Syria to switch sides and join Iraq. &quot;It will be anevent which will be recorded in history if President HafezAssad joins the group of the faithful and reacts with them sothat the group will be more powerful,&quot; he said.   There's no indication that Syria will do anything of thatsort. But a senior U.S. official traveling with Secretary ofState James Baker on an international tour to discuss warplans acknowledged that Syrian troops are unlikely to joinany offensive strike to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.   The official said that even before Mr. Baker's latesttrip, which included a stop in Syria, the U.S. considered ita &quot;given&quot; that Syria would allow its troops to be used onlyto defend Saudi Arabia against attack from Iraq, not in anoffensive international military drive. As a result of Mr.Baker's consultations, the U.S. has concluded that this isSyria's intention.   The official said that Iraq's efforts to portray itsoccupation of Kuwait as an effort to draw world attention tothe plight of Israeli-occupied Palestinian lands has made itincreasingly difficult for Syria to contemplate joining anattack on Iraq.   By the same token, top U.S. generals in Saudi Arabia haveshelved plans to include Saudi Arabia and other Arab forcesin the first ground attacks against Kuwait, according tocommanders in the field.   Military planners abandoned the idea, these officers said,because of potential communication problems, wide differencesin equipment and the lack of joint training maneuvers overthe past few months. The decision indicates that the U.S. hasgiven up hope of crafting more workable, clear-cut commandarrangements covering all of the American, European and Arabforces in the Gulf.   The U.S. is especially concerned that Arab forces don'thave the training and the logistics to keep up with anall-out ground assault, which, once it starts, could requireheavy tank units to sweep across the desert at up to 40 milesan hour.   Still, Mr. Baker insisted upon completing his weeklongtrip to Europe and the Mideast that &quot;the internationalcoalition is well prepared politically, economically andmilitarily for any eventuality as we move toward midnightJan. 15.&quot;   Mr. Baker received assurances from several Arab statesthat the coalition wouldn't split if Israel respondedmilitarily to an attack by Iraq. Following visits last weekto Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Egypt, Mr. Baker said the U.S.was &quot;very satisfied&quot; that these nations understood thatIsrael had the right of &quot;self-defense after an attack.&quot; Healso was assured that Saudi Arabia and the wealthy Gulfstates would continue paying a large share of the cost of theU.S. military deployment this year, including the costs of awar.   ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.
