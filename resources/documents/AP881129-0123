The suit, filed in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by theSave Yonkers Federation, was the latest skirmish in an eight-yearlegal battle that nearly brought the city of 195,000 to financialruin for defying the judge.   The federation comprises 13 citizens' groups opposed to U.S.District Judge Leonard Sand's order that Yonkers build 1,000 unitsof low- and middle-income housing scattered throughout the city toremedy decades of segregation.   The suit, which lists several hundred residents and merchants aspetitioners, maintains that the order deprives them of ``thebenefits of living and-or working in neighborhoods free from lowclass people (of any race) and the crime and housing rot whichnearly always accompanies their presence.''   ``To victimize the innocent because of wrongs by others _ byforcing upon those victims unwanted associations and by otherwisejeopardizing them, their families and their property _ is surely toviolate a constitutional sense of justice,'' the suit said.   It said the residnets ``have lost value in their property andthus suffered economic injury.''   The group's lawyer, Brooklyn Law School professor Henry MarkHolzer, said the suit utilizes arguments never presented on behalfof the city. Those include what he said were a First Amendment rightnot to associate with certain people and the Tenth Amendmentestablishment of federalism and separation of powers.   The lawsuit was filed in an appeals court instead of U.S.District Court because it challenges Sand's authority to impose thedesegregation plan, said Holzer. If the suit succeeds, Sand willhave to refashion a remedy, Holzer said.   In 1985, five years after the U.S. Justice Department filed suit,Sand found the city liable for 40 years of intentionally segregatingits schools and housing. A school desegregation plan went intoeffect in 1986.   Sand later ordered the housing desegregation plan. The CityCouncil defied him in August and was found in contempt, paying out$819,000 in fines before capitulating to the threat of financialruin and agreeing to carry out the plan.   Appeals of Sand's ruling have failed. The Supreme Court refusedto hear the case.   Sand had no comment on the suit, according to his chambers.   Jack O'Toole, president of the Save Yonkers Federation, said theorganization has received donations from all over the country andwould take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.</TEXT></DOC>
