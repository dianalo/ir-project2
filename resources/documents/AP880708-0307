The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped about 1point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, whichmoves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interestrate trends, jumped to 9.09 percent from 9.00 percent late Thursday.   The yield on the 30-year issue stood much lower _ at 8.83percent _ a week earlier on Friday, July 1.   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemploymentrate in June dropped to 5.3 percent, its lowest level since 1974.The positive job showing, indicating vigor in the economy, had anegative impact on bond prices by arousing fears of acceleratinginflation.   ``There's no doubt that the data had a strong bias to it,'' saidWilliam Sullivan, director of money-market research at Dean WitterReynolds Inc. ``It's a constant reminder that the economy is fastapproaching a full employment status.''   The fall in bond values was braked, Sullivan suggested, by arebound in the dollar Friday against other major currencies onworld markets.   Maria Ramirez, a managing director of Drexel Burnham LambertInc., said the bond decline also was cushioned by companion LaborDepartment data showing that the average hourly wage was unchangedat $9.27 last month. Wage increases tend to be a strong indicatorof inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income assets such asbonds.   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-termgovernment issues declined \ point to 13-32 point, intermediatematurities lost 7-16 point to 9-16 point, and 20-year issues fell27-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., abusiness-information service.   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in theprice of a bond with a $1,000 face value.   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures pricemovements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of ayear or longer, slipped 0.50 to 109.00.
