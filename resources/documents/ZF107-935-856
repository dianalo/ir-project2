 The task can be confusing, butonce your Mac is connected, you have the resources of a mainframe availableat a mouse click.andP;  For those of you who are not gurus but still need thepower, here's a guide to the options for talking to Big Blue machines.andM;There are two pieces to this connectivity puzzle.andP;  The first isterminal-emulation software.andP;  Unlike PCs or Macs, the display terminalshooked up to mainframes are &quot;dumb&quot; -- that is, they lack processing power,kind of like TVs with keyboards.andP;  To communicate effectively with amainframe, your Mac must imitate a display terminal.andP;  Emulation softwaretranslates the data moving into the Mac so that your screen looks like astandard terminal screen.andP;  Data going back to the host (the mainframe) istranslated into IBM format.andP;  The most common IBM terminals are the 3270series, so this article focuses on software packages that emulate 3270terminals.andM;The second piece you'll need is a hardware connection to IBM's SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA), the standard for IBM mainframe networks.andP;  Thereare three options for fitting your Mac into SNA connectivity schemes.andP;  Thefirst possibility uses the Mac's serial port to make the connection throughdirect wiring or via a modem.andP;  On the mainframe side, this connection is madeeither to a protocol converter such as an IBM 7171, which translates theMac's ASCII characters into the EBCDIC used on the mainframe, or to athird-party box plugged into an IBM 3174 cluster controller, which is adevice that routes data between a mainframe and several terminals.andP;  A secondoption is to connect to SNA through LocalTalk, Ethernet, or token-ringnetworks.andP;  Finally, a coaxial cable can link your Mac directly to a clustercontroller.andM;Which method do you choose?andP;  The answer depends on the mainframe-to-PCstandards your company has already established.andP;  For instance, if your officehas a token-ring network, you'll have to install a token-ring card in yourMac.andP;  If you have local cluster controllers, a coax card is the way to go.andO;Let's take a closer look at the three way to connect your Mac to SNA and thenexamine the features of 3270-emulation software.andM;Serial-Port ConnectionandM;The simplest mainframe connection starts at the Mac's serial (modem) port.andO;You can plug directly from this port into the mainframe if it's nearby, oryou can use a modem to access it remotely (see Figure 1).andM;If you want to communicate via the serial port, there are severalterminal-emulation packages that will do the trick.andP;  MicroPhone II,VersaTerm-PRO, DynaComm, and Mac3270 Async can emulate terminals such as theVT100 or the IBM 3708, among others (see &quot;Custom Calling,&quot; August '89).andP;  For3270 emulation, however, you have only two choices: Simware's Mac3270 Asyncand Avatar's MacMainFrame DX.andP;  At press time, these were also the onlyserial-port 3270 solutions available for the Mac Portable.andM;Mac3270 Async, which connects your Macto the mainframe by way of a protocolconverter, costs a mere $250.andP;  Unfortunately, the host mainframe must befitted with SIM3278, a software package that costs between $10,000 and$20,000, depending on the mainframe configuration.andP;  Overall, Mac3270 Asyncworks well, but it has some minor bugs when it's used with the Mac IIcx thatprevent Mac keyboard commands such as Command-C from working.andP;  Simware isaware of the problems and plans to fix them in its next upgrade, due out bythe end of 1989.andM;Avatar's MacMainFrame DX hooks into a cluster controller instead of aprotocol converter.andP;  This solution is substantially cheaper; the $1,195 priceincludes both the Mac software and the hardware required for the mainframe.andM;Network GatewaysandM;You can also link your Mac to a mainframe through a LocalTalk or Ethernetnetwork or by adding it to a token-ring network, which is IBM's method forconnecting PCs and mainframes (see Figure 2).andM;LocalTalk and Ethernet networks can be connected to an IBM mainframe by usingTri-Data's Netway, the most popular Macintosh-to-mainframe solution.andP;  Netwaypackaged include both the gateway hardware and Macintosh software.andP;  TheNetway 1000 ($3,995) connects a LocalTalk network of up to 16 users; theNetway 2000 ($9,995) supports up to 64 users on LocalTalk, Ethernet, andtoken-ring networks.andM;Netway's principal advantage is its low cost per connection because itreplaces the need for a coax or token-ring card in each Mac.andP;  Netway alsofunctions as a 3174 cluster controller on an SNA network, which saves thecost of buying one.andP;  The trade-off is speed, especially when transferringfiles.andP;  Netway uses a modem to connect to the mainframe, and its top speed is56 Kbps (kilobytes per second), which is less than one-fourth the speed ofLocalTalk.andP;  This can be a bottleneck to throughput, driving up on-line costs.andM;If your office uses a token-ring network for PC-to-mainframe connectivity,you can now attach your Mac directly to it.andP;  Apple's recently introducedToken Talk NB Card ($1,250) makes the physical connection, and its MacDFTsoftware ($245) can access the mainframe.andP;  However, installation of atoken-ring node is not plug and play; it requires a system administrator forproper setup.andM;The Coax ConnectionandM;The third approach to making the mainframe connection is through an add-oncard that connects directly to an SNA network through category &quot;A&quot; coaxialcable (see Figure 3).andP;  This solution usually costs more than $1,000 perMacintosh, but it offers a fast, secure connection.andM;There are three main players marketing coax boards for the Mac, all of whichinclude 3270-emulation software: Apple (Coax/Twinax Card with MacDFTsoftware), Avatar (MacMainFrame hardware and software), and DigitalCommunications Associates (DCA--MacIrma board and software).andP;  DCA's boardalso runs Mac3270 Master, a coax version of Simware's Mac3270 Async.andP;  (Afourth player, Novell, is reworking its Mac PCox board and distributing it inlimited quantities only, so it isn't included here.)andM;How do you choose a coax board?andP;  First determine which companies makeproducts for your Mac (see Table 1).andP;  If you're looking for a one-companysolution, only Avatar covers the full Macintosh line.andP;  It offers MacMainFrameboards and software for the SE, SE/30, and Mac II family; MacMainFrame DXprovides dial-in capabilities for the Portable and allows any Macintosh froma 512KE on up to connect to a cluster controller.andP;  DCA supports all machinesdown to the SE level.andP;  Apple offers the slimmest choice; its Coax/TwinaxNuBus card works only with the Mac II line.andM;All three vendors make reliable hardware that does the job.andP;  Apple's cardstands out slightly because it contains a 68000 chip that can executecommunications protocols itself, which frees the Mac for other processing.andO;But the only difference users might see between the cards is betterMultiFinder perforamnce with Apple's card.andP;  Otherwise, it's theterminal-emulation software that differentiates the coax packages, so makeyour buying decision based on a packaged that offers the functionality youneed daily.andM;Terminal TypesandM;Terminal-emulation software on the Mac displays a window with contents thatlook exactly like a mainframe session on a 3270 terminal.andP;  The windows arepretty plain, but there are a dozen or so key software features.andP;  Youprobably won't need all of them, but some will be crucial to your particulartask.andM;In the IBM world, the standard 3270 terminal operates in control-unitterminal (CUT) mode, which means that the terminal is a basic one-sessiondumb screen and keyboard.andP;  All the Mac emulation packages work in CUT mode.andO;The next step up is the distributed-function terminal (DFT) mode, in whichsome of the functions of the cluster controller are performed on theterminal.andP;  This gives the Mac the ability to maintain up to five simultaneoussessions with the mainframe -- that is, you can have up to five windows onyour Mac, each accessing a different mainframe application.andM;Avatar's MacMainFrame was the only coax package offering DFT functionality atpress time (see Figure 4).andP;  Its DFT implementation follows Mac interfaceguidelines very well and is quite elegant.andP;  Apple's MacDFT software firstshipped with only the CUT-mode emulator running, but it should be upgraded tofull DFT support by now.andP;  If you're part of a network, Tri-Data's Netwaysoftware also works in DFT mode, providing this capability to all Macs on thenetwork.andM;Popular 3270 terminals include the monochrome 3278 models 2, 3, 4, and 5, andthe color 3279 models 2 and 3.andP;  These are all supported by every vendorexcept Simware, which supports only the model 2s.andP;  All vendors supportApple's Color Picker for defining on-screen color, but only DCA offers add-onsoftware (MacIrma Graphis, $195) to emulate a 3179G or 3192G APA graphicsgerminal.andP;  (Avatar planned to have this capability by the end of 1989.)andP;  WithMacIrma Graphics, you can use the Mac to display output from the SAS/Graphand tellagraf mainframe programs as long as your mainframe has IBM's GDDM(version 2.1.1 or newer) and PCLK/F graphics system software.andM;Perhaps the most frustrating thing about working on a mainframe with a PC iskeyboard mapping.andP;  Everyone has a different idea about where the Enter keyshould be.andP;  Having a friendly interface for mapping the keyboard is more thanuseful--it's essential.andP;  The software vendors provide icon-driven windows fordragging the various terminal functions to a picture of the keyboard'scurrent map.andP;  Apple's MacDFT has the clearest representation of the keyboardand is the easiest to use.andP;  You simply drag a terminal function to the keyyou want to perform that function.andP;  MacDFT uses the familiar trash-canmetaphor to clear a key for reassignment, whereas MacMainFrame and MacIrmarequire you to use an eraser tool to clear a key before reassigning it.andM;If you're used to working on an IBM terminal or a PC, you'll appreciate thefloating keypad that the software packages provide for the Mac.andP;  It containsterminal-specific keys such as function keys, PA1, PA2, and Clear.andP;  InMacIrma and MacDFT, this keypad is a tear-off menu.andP;  At press time, theMacMainFrame keypad was a tear-off only in the DFT version (see Figure 4),but Avatar was planning to include it in an upgraded CUT version.andP;  Tri-Datauses a pop-up keypad in its Netway software.andM;MacDFT the MacIrma let you lock your terminal-emulation settings with apassword.andP;  This feature doesn't prevent other users from having their ownsettings files, but it does solve the problem of someone changing thekeyboard map that you prefer.andM;Mainframes for the Rest of UsandM;Mac users expect certain features (major and minor) in all their software,and 3270 emulation is no exception.andP;  The emulation packages can cut and pastea terminal image.andP;  They also can do an &quot;intelligent&quot; copy that puts tabs inthe place of spaces on-screen -- useful for cutting from the screen andpasting directly into a Mac spreadsheet.andP;  The selection area can be thenormal line-by-line type or block mode.andP;  MacMainFrame's implementation is abit more automatic because it assumes that if there are two spaces, theyshould be replaced by a tab.andP;  MacIrma requires that you specify the number ofspaces that should be replaced by a tab.andM;Control over font size is another feature all the products support.andP;  Since a3270 session window can be only 80 or 132 characters wide (depending on theterminal), changing the font size resizes the terminal), window.andO;MacMainFrame's DFT versions offer a handy on-screen option that has fontsizes listed at the right of the window.andP;  Click on the size you want, and thewindow is resized.andM;The packages also provide a special font to display characters particular tothe IBM mainframe environment.andP;  My favorite is MacMainFrame's Armonk font.andO;(Armonk, New York, is to IBM what Cupertino, California, is to Apple.)andP;  TheMacDFT font is a close second, while the MacIrma A and B fonts are not asnice.andM;Mac programmers will appreciate the application-program interfaces (APIs)each product offers.andP;  APIs let you create front ends for mainframe programsand are useful for automating file transfers, masking complex procedures suchas log-on, and creating Mac-like interfaces to mainframe programs.andP;  All thevendors provide APIs, but DCA is the leader.andP;  (APIs will be covered in moredepth in a future Bridges article.)andM;Fiel TransferandM;Moving files between a Mac and mainframe is much simpler than the methodsused on DOS machines.andP;  All the vendors take full advantage of the Macinterface to provide built-in menus for file transfer.andP;  This sure beatslooking up the procedure in a manual and typing it at the command line!andM;In addition to proprietary formats, all the products support IBM's standardIND$FILE protocol, and MacIrma also supports IrmaLink and ForteNet formats.andO;MacMainFrame has a batch-transfer mode, which can operate in the backgroundunder MultiFinder.andM;Apple's MacDFT can record a session's keystrokes for playback using a macrolanguage.andP;  This features is quite useful for automating log-on sequences andis a big plus for Apple.andM;Even more impressive is the scripting language that comes with Simware'sMac3270.andP;  Its 120 commands and functions can automate repetitive processessuch as log-on and log-off, network navigation, and file transfer.andP;  A scriptcan be compiled as an external script to be called when needed, or it can bestored as an internal script, part of the Session document created by Mac3270to save user settings.andP;  You can assign a script to a key, using thekeyboard-mapping feature.andP;  Double-clicking on a key opens the Key Scriptdialog box, which allows shorter scripts of up to 250 characters to bewritten for the selected key.andM;If that isn't enough to make you smile, consider this: With only a fewexceptions, the Mac3270 script commands and functions are the same as thosein SIMPC, Mac3270's sister program that runs on IBM PCs.andP;  This means that asingle mainframe front end for both Macs and PCs can be developed anddistributed on a companywide basis.andM;ConclusionandM;The obstacles that once prevented the Mac from working in an IBM environmentno longer exist, thanks to advances in terminal-emulation software and theavailability of coaxial and token-ring cards and gateways.andM;If you have more than a handful of MAcs, Tri-Data's Netway is the mostcost-effective connection to SNA.andP;  For users on the road, a serial coneectionto the mainframe via modem gives you access from anywhere.andP;  Simware's Mac3270Async is an inexpensive solution only if you already have the mainframesoftware.andP;  Otherwise, the low-cost serial solution is Avatar's MacMainFrameDX, which has more features than does Mac3270 Async.andM;If performance is your main concern, however, a coax card is your best bet.andO;After working with all the coax products over several weeks, I was drawn tothe look and feel of Avatar's MacMainFrame DFT.andP;  It has more functionalityand the most complete set of features.andP;  You really can't go wrong with any ofthe boards, and you might need some of MacIrma's terminals, but overall,Avatar's MAcMainFrame DFT is the price/performance leader among coax cards.andM;Ernest H. Mariette is principal consultant for Mariette SystemsInternational, which solves Macintosh-to-IBM connectivity problems forFortune 1000 companies.andP;  Randy Killen of 4GL Consulting provided the reviewof Simware products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
