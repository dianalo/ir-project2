Meese, who is not participating in the Pentagon investigationbecause his lawyers are representing clients involved in it, willbe gone from the Justice Department by the time federal prosecutorsare ready to seek indictments in the Pentagon investigation laterthis year.   But Meese has said through a spokesman he hopes to wrap up anumber of other loose ends before leaving in late July or earlyAugust, including the question of whether the Detroit Free Pressand the Detroit News should be allowed to merge their advertising,circulation and production operations under the NewspaperPreservation Act.   Meese also may still be in office when the department decideswhether to seek an indictment of Marcos, who has been investigatedby a number of federal grand juries since he was ousted in February1986. Marcos lives in exile in Honolulu.   Federal prosecutors are asking for approval from JusticeDepartment superiors to seek grand jury indictments against Marcos,and his wife, Imelda, on fraud and other charges, law enforcementofficials have said.   The proposed charges include allegations of a conspiracy tosteal from the Philippine government over two decades and fraud inthe way money was concealed in the United States behind falseownerships, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Among the other issues a successor will be coping with afterMeese leaves:   _The Justice Department's drug testing program, which wouldsubject 1,800 employees in sensitive jobs to mandatory, randomurinalysis. The employees, many of them lawyers, are suing thedepartment, saying the program that could begin shortly violatestheir constitutional right to due process and to protection againstunreasonable searches and seizures.   _Trying to push through Congress a legislative package in thewar on drugs. The administration is promoting legislationauthorizing the death penalty for defendants who are convicted ofmurder while engaged in a continuing drug enterprise.   Justice Department officials also are anxious to have the Senateconfirm Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen, AssociateAttorney General Francis Keating and criminal division chief EdwardDennis. All are currently serving in acting capacities, withconfirmation hearings scheduled for the end of the month.   Keating has been on the job about two months, while Christensenand Dennis arrived early in June.   Christensen and Dennis are replacing former Deputy AttorneyGeneral Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld,whose protest resignations March 29 over Meese's continued tenurebrought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department.</TEXT></DOC>
