He beat the tom-toms. Hedanced around the bonfire with other men. He shared their stories and theirpain, and they shared his.;    He set out for the wilderness as a cynic. Hereturned a convert.;    &quot;It was surprisingly moving,&quot; he told me.;    Well,good.;    &quot;Those are all men who never played football in high school,&quot; saidanother male friend.;    The point is that men are no more unified on theimportance of gathering in the wilderness -- or on any of the other issuesembraced by the men's movement -- than women are on the topics we looselygather under the heading of &quot;women's issues.&quot;;    The men's movement, in itsvarious incarnations, surfaces to gasp at reality every few years before itsplashes downward once again.;    As our parents long ago told us, this isjust a phase.;    Yet the current phase tells me it's time for a chat withFred Hayward, Sacramento resident and founder of Men's Rights Inc. A pioneerof sorts, ubiquitous in his own right, Fred plunged into men's issues in1977.;    But Hayward, bless him, isn't concerned with the RobertBly-repressed primitive side of manhood -- what he calls the &quot;mytho-poetical&quot;part of the men's movement. He's never attended a wilderness retreat.;    &quot;ButI probably will do it,&quot; he says. &quot;It's more out of curiosity than a sense ofneed. Because I keep reading about it, and I keep getting asked questionsabout it.;    &quot;I think people are surprised there's more to the men's movementthan that -- that there are other issues to talk about.&quot;;    Those issues,from Hayward's perspective, include child support and custody, the unfairnessof all-male military conscription, destructive lifestyles that lead to theaverage male life expectancy being eight years shorter than women's, anddiscrimination against men in any other form that comes to his attention.;   All are issues that bear consideration. All are issues, unfortunately, thatHayward turns into hypothetical equations to prove discrimination exists. Asin:;    &quot;I'm convinced that if women died eight years before men, it would bethe No. 1 issue of our time. Gender genocide would be the crisis.&quot;;    So manyifs, so much outrage in search of a focus: Victimization on a trans-gender,global scale, as if the issues themselves didn't deserve analysis in their ownright.;    Yet, he says, &quot;I look at men and women as dependent on each other,not competing with each other. That leads to a whole different approach&quot; fromfeminism, which in his view, blames men for women's problems.;    &quot;Most peoplewould assume the message of men's rights is that the women's movement has gonetoo far. My message is that the women's movement hasn't gone far enough. . . .Feminism was the breakthrough, a marvelous breakthrough. I really respect whatfeminism has done, but it's time to move beyond that.&quot;;    And the wildernessretreats? A harmless splinter.;    &quot;They're not talking about issues thatupset women as much,&quot; he says.;    Now, there's a statement ripe with blame ifI ever heard one.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Anita Creamer column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910720  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  713  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 20, 199100202108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
