Gorbachev has been to theUnited States twice before but only in New York City and Washington.   ``We have a lot of difficult issues to discuss with theSoviets,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,mentioning disputes over arms control and Soviet pressure on theindependence-minded Baltic states.   ``I think this summit will demonstrate a new sense of realismabout our relationship, one in which both sides can be critical ofeach other, both sides can raise troublesome and difficult issuesand expect to explore them in depth,'' he said.   Gorbachev's meetings with Bush will begin with a formalwelcoming ceremony at the White House on Wednesday, May 31, andconclude with a joint news conference on Sunday, June 3.   In between, there will be four formal rounds of talks at theWhite House, concluding Friday evening.   Bush will be host at a state dinner Thursday for Gorbachev. TheSoviet leader will reciprocate with a dinner at the Soviet Embassyfor Bush.   On Saturday, the two leaders will fly to Camp David, thepresidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, for a day ofprivate discussions.   Fitzwater said the Camp David talks would focus on politicalissues such as changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union andchallenges facing the NATO alliance.   From Washington, Gorbachev will fly to Minneapolis for asix-hour stop.   Gov. Rudy Perpich said Gorbachev wants to meet with agriculturaland business leaders who are interested in closer ties in hightechnology and food processing.   From Minneapolis, Gorbachev will fly to San Francisco for anovernight stop. The next day, June 4, the Soviet president willvisit Stanford University.   The university is the home of the Hoover Institution on War,Revolution and Peace, which has the world's largest collection ofmaterial on the 1917 Russian Revolution, and many scholarsunsympathetic to the fruits of that revolution which brought theCommunists to power.   University officials, who only a day earlier professed ignoranceabout a Gorbachev visit, said they learned Tuesday that he wouldspend three hours on campus. U.S. officials in Washington said hemight give a speech there.   Soviet officials also began exploring the possibility of areunion between Gorbachev and Reagan, who held five summit meetingswhen Reagan was president.   Staff members in Reagan's Los Angeles office said Sovietofficials contacted them Tuesday about a meeting but that noarrangements had been completed. Mark Weinberg, a spokesman forReagan, said Monday that the former president would be in the statein early June.</TEXT></DOC>
