PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An official newspaper exposed Friday the27-year-old secret of how soldiers killed a score of strikers in ablaze of gunfire, secretly buried them and hid their bloodstainsunder a thick coat of cement.   Recollections published by the youth newspaper KomsomolskayaPravda marked the anniversary of the 1962 strike over foodshortages in the southern city of Novocherkassk, and for the firsttime officially confirmed rumors circulating for decades.   ``I heard the massive fire of submachine guns ... as a result ofthe use of firearms, 22 or 24 people were killed, including a boyof school age,'' recalled the region's former assistant militarycommander, retired Lt. Gen. Matvey K. Shaposhnikov. ``Thirty peoplewere wounded.''   ``The next morning I found out that the dead were secretlyburied,'' he said. Shaposhnikov said he opposed the action and waskicked out of the Communist Party in 1968 for trying to expose it.   A. Simonov, a teacher, told the paper that after the massacre,``they tried to wash the blood from the square for a long time,first with fire engines, then other ways, with brushes, and at lastcalled in a steamroller and laid a thick layer of pavement.''   Soviet officials long denied Soviet dissidents' and Westernsources' reports of the massacre and their charges that at least 70people were killed.   Komsomolskaya Pravda displayed the story over half its back pagewith commentary from three legislators saying it is fitting toreport on the bloodshed as the newly elected Congress of People'sDeputies meets.   The inaugural session of the first competitively elected SovietCongress has included unprecedented criticism of the CommunistParty and government and forced open discussion of such issues asthe 1940 seizure of the Baltic republics and recent ethnic violencein the Caucasus republics.   In contrast to the secrecy surrounding the Novocherkasskkillings, a national outcry followed the military's violentdispersal of pro-independence protesters in Tbilisi, Georgia, inApril, where 20 people were killed.   Long lines for food and protests of official mismanagementcaused the Novocherkassk strike, the paper said.   ``Lines at the stores for meat and oil grew before your eyes,''it said.   ``But the more alarming the situation became, the louder soundedthe fanfare, promises of rapid success and the rapid approach ofcommunism.''   Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at the time, denouncedStalinism and eased his pervasive repression while promising rapideconomic progress.   Instead, workers were faced with poor living conditions,relatively high rents and nothing to buy in the stores.   Finally, they struck at the Budenny locomotive factory. Theregional Communist Party chief, identified in the paper only asBasov, arrived to calm them but ended up complaining to a meetingabout how difficult his life was, recalled factory engineer S.Yelkin.   ``Hooligans began throwing bottles at him, and we decided to getBasov out of there. We helped him slip out of a window and into acar.''   Strike organizers were arrested the next morning, but otherfactories went on strike, and the military was deployed with tanksand armored personnel carriers.   At the same time, Shaposhnikov recalled, thousands of peoplewaving red banners began marching in the city center. They werehalted and scattered by gunfire from soldiers.   Komsomolskaya Pravda said two senior Moscow officials, AnastasMikoyan and F.R. Kozol, were dispatched to Novocherkassk andorganized the Aug. 14 trial of the most active strike organizers.   ``Seven people were sentenced to be shot,'' the newspaper said.   ``A review of those criminal cases _ a careful, impassionate andjust analysis of them _ is our obligation to the truth,'' itconcluded.</TEXT></DOC>
