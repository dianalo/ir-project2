ScheierandM;If you still think viruses are a hoax, talk to John Meier.andM;Meier, a partner with information-systems specialists Andersen Consulting,spent 45 hours earlier this month fighting the &quot;Jerusalem&quot; virus, which hitPCs in the firm's office in Manila, Philippines.andM;He saved all the data about company clients and kept the users up, losing&quot;only a few hours of productive time,&quot; he said.andM;But that achievement meant dismantling the entire 225-workstation network,disinfecting hundreds of floppy disks and unhooking the A drives of PCs toprevent the use of contaminated floppies.andM;A major international bank in Asia spent nearly a month and at least $100,000as the information-systems staff went from floor to floor with walkie-talkiesto cleanse 40 PCs of the &quot;Microbe&quot; virus.andM;Many virus scares, such as the Oct.andP;  13 &quot;Datacrime&quot; bug, are overblown.andP;  Butviruses are a genuine threat -- they can cause real damage, and it takes realwork to guard against them.andM;The good news is that basic steps, such as proper backups and bans on&quot;shareware,&quot; go a long way toward reducing the threat.andM;&quot;Never assume you are safe,&quot; said Meier.andP;  &quot;To do those routine backups isjust a way you have to do business.andP;  Viruses are very unforgiving.&quot;andM;The Jerusalem virus first struck Andersen on Oct.andP;  4, when some programs onthe firm's 286- and 386-based clones began taking up more and more RAM untilthe PCs crashed.andM;Using off-the-shelf and internally developed software, Meier's staff checkedworkstations, servers and hundreds of floppy disks.andP;  They stripped everypiece of software from the network and reinstalled it from scratch.andP;  &quot;Wequeried all the users, and made sure we understood what was on or not onindividual workstations.andP;  We flushed hundreds of pieces of executable codethat were either infected, old or we didn't know what they were,&quot; he said.andM;Because he suspects the virus spread from an infected floppy, his staffunhooked the floppy drives on many PCs.andP;  They won't be reconnected untilMeier is sure how the virus began and how to prevent its spread.andM;Andersen had a relatively quick recovery, he said, but only because it hadbackups of critical data and fresh code to load onto PCs, and took amethodical approach to searching for infection.andM;The attack at the bank came just as it was switching from DisplayWrite 4 toWordPerfect 5.0, and replacing 5-1/4-inch drives with 3-1/2-inch ones.andP;  Ittook three to four days just to figure out that a virus, not the switchover,was causing the problems, said the head of the bank's microcomputer systemsgroup.andM;Meanwhile, frustrated users tried their diskettes in different PCs, causingthe virus to &quot;spread like wildfire,&quot; said the bank's head of informationsystems.andP;  Once the virus was found, he said, &quot;we had to take about half ourmainframe systems-development people, go floor by floor, and sanitize all themachines.andM;&quot;For three and a half weeks, we were very severely impacted,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Wehad to commandeer machines as soon as we could get to them.andP;  We got many,many people very, very upset with us.&quot;andM;Before the Microbe virus attacked, many users treated viruses as a joke.andM;But everyone takes the threat seriously now.andP;  The micro-systems manager hassources who pass on the latest viruses so he can test his defenses, and nouser runs any new software until the information-systems department approvesit.andP;  Both the bank and Andersen have anti-viral software in place.andM;But officials at both firms agree there is no guarantee against thatone-in-a-thousand virus hit.andP;  The best precautions, they say, are the basicones: Back up your files, don't use shareware and educate your users so theywise up before -- not after -- they get burned.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
