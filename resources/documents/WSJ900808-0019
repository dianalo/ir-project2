But recession-wary investors now tempted to stash some oftheir money in health-care stocks may want to note thatexecutives, directors and other industry &quot;insiders&quot; haverecently been selling.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, Securities and Exchange Commission filings showthat the health-care industry has recently been leading allother industries in stock sales by insiders, overtaking thecomputer industry, which had long held the dubiousdistinction of &quot;most sold.&quot;   Forty-four of the 167 health-care and hospital companiestracked by Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that keepstabs on such matters, were involved in recent insider sales.   All together, 134 insiders were net sellers of about 5.6million shares since April 1, according to reports filed withthe SEC. While the insiders were largely taking profits afterrun-ups in the sector's stocks, many top executives soldsignificant percentages of their holdings.   &quot;Across the board, the picture for this group&quot; of stocks&quot;indicates it's at the higher level of valuation,&quot; saidRobert Gabele, Invest/Net's president. Even with the stockmarket's overall decline of the past few days, he said, &quot;thejury's still out on whether there's a buying opportunity inthese stocks yet.&quot;   Right now, the health-care sector includes &quot;a number ofstocks that were overpriced, and, in some cases, there aresome problems in the companies,&quot; said John Kaweske, portfoliomanager of Financial Programs Inc.'s Financial Health, amutual fund that invests in health-care, biotechnology andpharmaceutical stocks.   With the possibility of a recession, Mr. Kaweske said herecently sold all of his health maintenance organizationstocks because he predicts they won't thrive in a period offederal budget constraints. But he bought shares ofHealthdyne Inc. yesterday because the company is working onmoving medical procedures out of the high-cost hospitalsetting.

The stock closed in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading yesterday at $40.25, up 62.5cents.   &quot;You couldn't find a more bullish group,&quot; Mr. Hirsch said,because whether there's a recession or not, the company isinsulated. &quot;Somebody doesn't have their gall bladder outbecause they're in or out of a recession.&quot;   At National Medical Enterprises, a Santa Monica, Calif.,owner and operator of hospitals and medical-care facilities,eight insiders have sold 305,591 shares valued at about $10.7million since April 5, SEC filings show.
