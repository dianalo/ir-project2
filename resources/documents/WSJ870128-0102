This was the administration's first offer of subsidized grain to China. Although farming interests have contended that the subsidy program should cover all markets, the administration has limited it to markets where U.S. officials say the European Common Market has used its own export subsidies to take business away from U.S. farmers.    Originally, the administration also excluded Communist nations from the program. But last year, it offered a subsidized sale of four million tons of wheat to the Soviet Union -- which spurned the offer as not competitive with world prices. And in recent months, the U.S. has offered discounted wheat sales totaling 950,000 tons to Poland and Romania.    As part of the Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, China would be given a bonus of U.S. government-owned grain as an inducement to buy wheat at the commercial price. The transaction would be aimed at providing China with wheat at an overall price that is competitive in world markets.    World prices are still lower than the U.S. commercial price, despite sharply reduced federal supports and a resulting drop in wheat prices under a U.S. farm law enacted in December 1985. Recent bonuses for wheat under the export-subsidy program have been $48 a metric ton or higher.    China, which bought U.S. corn recently at commercial prices, has told administration officials that it wants to buy subsidized U.S. wheat. Canada and Australia, which vigorously protested the offer to the Soviet Union because it is one of their markets, also have sold sizable amounts of wheat to China.    The offer is the 61st export-bonus offer the U.S. has made under a program that for a while accounted for most of the nation's grain export sales in a depressed market. Nations whose markets were added to the program recently include Switzerland, the Dominican Republic and Zanzibar along with China, Poland and Romania.    Under the program, mandated by Congress in 1985, the department has offered 22.1 million metric tons of farm products and completed $1.04 billion of sales. </TEXT></DOC>
