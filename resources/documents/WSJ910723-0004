Southwest Savings, which has $3.9 billion in assets and $3billion in deposits, would be the biggest thrift acquired byTemple-Inland since its federally assisted purchase ofGuaranty Federal Savings Bank in 1988. Temple-Inland isprimarily a maker of paper and building products.</LP><TEXT>   Negotiations on the acquisition are continuing betweenTemple-Inland and the Resolution Trust Corp., which took overSouthwest Savings in May 1990. The American Banker, a weeklytrade publication, reported that Temple-Inland had won thebidding, but neither the company nor the RTC would confirmthe report.   One sticking point in the negotiations could be the RTC'spolicy of refusing to sell failed institutions directly tothrifts that were created and sold in 1988. The 1988 thrifttransactions, which included both Guaranty Federal andSouthwest Savings, remain under review and renegotiation bythe RTC. Until the reviews are completed, newly acquiredthrifts must be operated separately from thrifts bought in1988.   Because of the RTC policy, Temple-Inland used itspreviously owned Kilgore Federal Savings andamp; Loan Associationto acquire 13 small failed thrifts from the RTC last year.The joint bid by Kilgore and Guaranty for Southwest Savingsis a first by the company.   The two thrifts, which together have $4.48 billion indeposits, are part of Temple-Inland's financial servicesgroup. The group contributed $508 million of the company's$2.4 billion in revenue last year.</TEXT></DOC>
