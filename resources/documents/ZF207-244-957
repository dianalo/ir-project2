 Dressed in bright,mismatched colors and patterns, the youngsters climb on jungle gyms and singnursery rhymes.andP;  They work puzzles and wiggle through mazes.andP;  Most of all,they giggle and shriek.andM;Next door is the JHM Corporation.andP;  With its leek charcoal gray interior, lowlighting, and humming computers, it is a seedbed of creativity, the world of73-year-old John Henry Martin.andP;  Martin is the man who turned thetechnological wonders of the personal computer into a playground of learning.andO;Since his highly acclaimed IBM Writing to Read computer-basd instructionalprogram was introduced four years ago, nearly 1 million children inkindergarten and first grade across the country have used it.andM;James Surratt, superintendent of Volusia County, Florida, schools, whoparticipated in one of the first pilot tests of the Writing to Read program,calls it &quot;the first program I've used in my career that works and continuesto work.&quot;andP;  Last fall, Spanish Writing to Read (VALE) was introduced.andP;  Andthousands of three-to-six-year-olds have begun exploring the world oflanguage with Get Set for Writing to Read.andM;Martin has also designed a learning program for illiterate adolescents andadults: Principles of the Alphabet Literacy System (PALS), an instructionalsystem that has a phenomenal 80 percent success rate, which Martin thinks hecan raise even higher.andP;  PALS gives many of this country's 23 million adutlswho cannot read a way out of illiteracy.andM;Right now Martin and the staff of his think tank are putting the finishingtouches on a sequel to Writing to Read, called Writing to Write, for childrenin the second to sixth grades.andP;  Testing will begin in 1989.andP;  And he has justsubmitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation for the developmentof a three-year, computer-based science program for middle-school students.andM;Most remarkable of all, Martin has done all of this since he came to Florida15 years ago to die.andM;Classroom DreamsandM;Growing up in the slums of Paterson, New Jersey, John Henry Martin was ayoungster, he recalls, &quot;whose external appearance and nonconforming mind mademe less than a model student.&quot;andP;  Even though he was expelled frequently anddropped out from time to time, he finally graduated from high school twomonths short of his 20th birthday.andP;  By then, his disdain for school had beentransformed into a dream of making a career of the classroom, to become ateacher and to &quot;understand children.&quot;andM;Martin would up at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, a school with lowentrance requirements, which was a $15 Greyhound bus ride from Paterson.andP;  &quot;Iwasn't very smart, and I was very poor,&quot; he recalls.andM;While working several jobs to meet expenses, he also taught without pay in aone-room schoolhouse, where the student population was 28 on a sunny day and60 when the rain kept them out of the fields.andP;  There he became &quot;intoxicatedwith teaching.&quot;andM;That experience taught him, he says, what is wrong with education: at theturn of the century, U.S.andP;  educators adopted the Prussian system of boxingstudents in a classroom according to age and curriculum.andP;  The moreappropriate learning arena is the one-room school, where learning is notbound by set parameters.andM;&quot;The one-room schoolteacher was a teacher who found nothing to beextraordinary and who understood that children differ markedly.andM;&quot;Or, as one of my students put it: 'Mr.andP;  Martin, don't you understand thatsome of us is smarter than others?'andM;&quot;Another truism is that everybody is smarter in some things than in others.&quot;andM;Can the computer replicate the one-room-school concept?andP;  Martin thinks itcan, if educators allow it to.andM;&quot;The computer can help if the software is so designed, and that's important:if one or two children working at a computer at nine years of age areunusually bright and can move themselves through all levels of arithmetic,they can move on into higher forms of mathematics.andP;  In the same room, anotherchild or two may be much slower.andM;&quot;But the computer can provide for that range of difference from databases ofhuge storage capacity--that is, once we recover from the absurd notion of thelast ten years that a single disk to supplement the child's classroom teacherin drill and practice is the right way to use a computer.&quot;andM;Martin moved on from that one-room school outside Tuscaloosa to a brilliantcareer as an educator.andP;  He earned master's and doctoral degrees from TeachersCollege at Columbia University, taught in high schools, colleges, andgraduate schools, and served as superintendent of rural, suburban, and cityschool systems.andM;He is an author and a college lecturer, and he serves as a congressionalwitness on matters of education and child welfare.andM;In October 1973, while serving as chairman of the National Panel on HighSchool and Adolescent Education of the Department of Health, Education andWelfare and the U.S.andP;  Office of Education, Martin suffered &quot;a fatal heartattack, dead on arrival&quot; at the hospital.andM;The hospital revived him.andP;  Barely.andP;  Four months later, physicallyincapacitated and confined to a wheelchair, he was brought to South Floridaby air ambulance.andP;  &quot;I came down here to die,&quot; he says.andM;Martin's wife, a registered nurse, &quot;bathed me, shaved me, and brushed myteeth for many, many weeks,&quot; he recalls.andP;  All the while he was working.andO;Within six months, he had finished writing the panel's report, The Educationof Adolescence.andP;  A year later Martin embarked on educational research thatled to the development of Writing to Read.andM;&quot;It was a natural course for me to take.andP;  I had made a lifetime hobby ofstudying children and how they learn, and I had always been fascinated withtechnology,&quot; he says.andM;A consultant to the Edison Laboratory in the 1950s, Martin started workingwith computer-aided instruction in the mid-1960s.andM;&quot;The learning theory base, upon which screens are created, was for many yearsvery, very narrow.andP;  Computer system instruction was seen as a multiple-choiceformat.andM;&quot;You can learn from taking a test, but there are better ways,&quot; he says.andM;Martin set out to design a better way.andM;The basis of Martin's educational research had always been twofold: the studyof how children learn, and the philosophical position that technology wouldbecome an interactive process using more sophisticated understanding of theelements of learning.andM;&quot;Motion picture, radio, TV, typewriter, overhead projector, taperecorder--all had been used in the schools as supplementary devices,&quot; saysMartin.andP;  The promise of the computer was that it would become all the above.andM;&quot;But in addition was the promise that sophisticated software design couldcreate an interactive environment in which the consequences of a learner'sresponse could be mediated in terms of the computer's response.andM;&quot;Short of that official intelligence, such response could be designed throughanticipation of a significant number of alternative 'what ifs.'&quot;andM;After four years of hard research, Martin completed Writing to Read, based onthe concept that whatever children can say, they can write.andP;  And whateverthey can write, they can read.andM;Unlike the chicken-or-the-egg conundrum, we know what came first: &quot;Without awriter, there would be nothing to read,&quot; Martin says.andM;In 1980, Martin began searching for a company that would produce and marketthe original Writing to Read program, which he had written on a Radio Shackcomputer.andP;  &quot;I had a finished product for them: the graphics, the printmaterial, the code,&quot; Martin recalls.andP;  &quot;I understand that's a bit unsual.&quot;andM;Of the several companies that looked at the program (Martin wouldn't identifythem), only IBM agreed to his stipulation that the program would not be puton the market until it had been tested in the field for two years andevaluated by an independent testing agency.andM;(Under Martin's contract with IBM, JHM develops the software; IBM has firstoption on any instructional programs he designs.andP;  Martin says he also hasbeen loaned some IBM equipment.andP;  IBM would say of their arrangement only thatMartin is a &quot;developer and publisher, and IBM has a formal relationship withhim.&quot;)andM;In the summer of 1984, the highly respected Educational Testing Service (ETS)in princeton, New Jersey, concluded that Writing to Read was an effectiveeducational program.andP;  IBM began marketing the program in the fall.andM;The initial ETS evaluation covered more than 10,000 students in kindergartenand first grade at 21 school districts the first year.andP;  During the secondyear, a core sample of 3,210 students using Writing to Read and 2,379comparison students in classes not using Writing to Read were tested.andM;The early studies showed that, on standardized reading tests, Writing to Readstudents progressed faster, on average, than comparison students; thatWriting to Read students clearly surpassed comparison students in writingperformance; and that Writing to Read students performed as well as otherstudents on spelling.andM;Teachers reported that Writing to Read students were more likely thancomparison students to spend a great deal of time on creative writing andless time on phonic and structural analysis.andM;Writing to Read is being used to teach English in China and Japan.andP;  And it'sused in 50 schools in the black homelands of South Africa, and in schools inManila, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.andP;  Every elementary school in Bermuda is usingthe program, according to Martin.andM;&quot;I visited some schools in China, and the children crawled all over me,wanting to read to me.andP;  It was a delightful sight to see their happy faces,to see their excitement in learning,&quot; Martin says.andM;Martin's only negative, though well-tempered, comment on IBM's marketing ofWriting to Read concerns the company's failure to make the program availableto the home computer market:  &quot;I urged them to release it for the homemarket, and for a while it looked like they would.andP;  I think they don't wantto offend school administrators,&quot; Martin says.andP;  (IBM will not comment on itsmarketing decisions.)andM;Ready, Set, GoandM;Martin's Get Set for Writing to Read, designed primarily forthree-to-six-year-olds, is available to the public ($250 at IBM instructionalcenters).andP;  Originally designed for operation on the PCjr, it also runs on anIBM PS/2 Model 25 with standard 512KB memory and speech attachment.andM;&quot;All the programs are multisensory,&quot; Martin says, &quot;to bring learning alive.&quot;andM;Children working with Get Set see, hear, and type the letters of the alphabeton the computer.andP;  They sing the letters, listen to nursery rhymes, makeletters with clay, trace them in sand, and write with pencils and chalk.andM;The program emphasizes the concept that spoken words are a flow of soundsthat have meaning, that letters make words, and that words contain segmentsor syllables that are repeated in other words.andM;In mid-1987, IBM introduced Martin's PALS program for adolescents and adultswho read and write below the fifth-grade level.andP;  &quot;The program is designed forthose who cannot read a label on a can, who cannot read a single story on thesports page of a newspaper,&quot; Martin says.andM;The two-part program depicts a fictionalized story of the development of thealphabet.andP;  The first half presents the story in a picture-book format; thesecond half consists of exercises designed to teach reading and writing.andO;Five layers of prompting help students to choose correct responses tocomputer-originated questions.andM;The letters and words are shown in balloons extending from the mouths of thepicture-book characters.andP;  &quot;It's a powerful concept,&quot; Martin says.andP;  &quot;Theballoon coming out of your mouth is an important piece of subliminalinformation.&quot;andM;PALS was converted to interactive videodisc by the University of Georgia inassociation with IBM Advanced Education Systems.andP;  It combines the use of IBMPCs, videodisc players, and the IBM InfoWindow Touch-Screen Display.andM;Designed to be used in a laboratory or a classroom, one PALS systemaccommodates 16 students for a one-hour daily lesson over a 20-week period.andM;PALS was field-tested in 1983 at Cardozo High School in Washington, D.C.andO;Twenty-four of the poorest readers in the all-black, 1,200-student schoolwere put in the PALS pilot program.andP;  After all completed the 100-hourprogram, their skills improved an average of three grade levels.andP;  Eighteenmonths ago, Martin did a follow-up to see what had happened to the students:16 had graduated from high school, one was in the Army, one had died, threeare still finishing high school, and eight of the 16 who graduated from highschool are in college.andP;  &quot;One was in his third year of college with a 3.2average,&quot; he proudly notes.andM;A PALS literacy center, which can accommodate 500 students a year, costsabout $60,000, according to IBM.andP;  Over a five-year period, the cost breaksdown to $50 per student, about the same as Writing to Read.andM;Martin says PALS works for 80 percent of the students.andP;  One reason some maynot succeed is their speech.andP;  &quot;The problem could be characterized as poorspeech--not dialect, but unclean sounds within the dialect, orpebbles-in-the-mouth speech,&quot; according to Martin.andM;&quot;I puzzled over this and worked to solve it, and I realized I was reinventingPygmalion: 'The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain.'&quot;andM;Right now more than 300 high schools and adult education centers across thecountry have PALS centers.andP;  One is located in a day-care center in Atlanta,for use by parents.andP;  The PALS system is also in state prisons in Kentucky,Virginia, Louisiana, and Georgia; in most cases, completion of the program isa parole requirement.andM;&quot;It's no favor to let someone out of prison if he can't read.andP;  What kind offuture is that?&quot; says Martin.andM;The Los Angeles Times recently installed a PALS system for its employees andtheir families and for residents of the surrounding community.andP;  Othercorporations and government agencies are considering adding PALS systems toserve their communities.andM;Instructional programs have proven their worth, both inside and outside theclassroom, but they are expensive to develop.andP;  That's why a program designerlike Martin needs a sponsor like Big Blue.andM;&quot;Look at my staff of 20 people.andP;  I have linguists, educational psychologists,cognitive psychologists, artists, programmers, consultants, on and on.andP;  Youget the finest people you can.andM;&quot;You go after government grants and foundation money.andP;  We write grantproposals.andP;  I have an amicable relationship with IBM.andP;  And I'm doing what Ilove,&quot; Martin says.andM;Martin works 12 to 15 hours each day at his office in North Palm Beach and athis home in Stuart.andP;  He swims 20 pool laps a day, sleeps four to six hours anight, hits the speech-making trail periodically, and never sits in a rockingchair.andP;  &quot;The rocking chair is a suicidal instrument,&quot; Martin says.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
