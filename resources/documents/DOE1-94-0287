They are expected to serve actually foron-site use, as well as purposes of utility generation. The likelihoodis that fuel cell applications for industrial use give reasonable promiseof introduction: (1) at the time when the existing autogeneration installationsare replaced, and (2) in the type of industry which has relatively smallscale factories failing to show their economic merits with conventionalsystems. Entry into these markets will not be gained unless steps aretaken to resolve such technical problems as: (1) achieving the desiredinstallation cost and performance goals, (2) assuring reliability andoperability (maintenance-free and other features) on a level not inferiorto the existing generating installations, (3) developing technology forthe recovery of high temperature waste heat of high utility value, and(4) promoting diversification of working fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
