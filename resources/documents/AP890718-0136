PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of 42 sled dogs from the InternationalTrans-Antarctica Expedition died of apparent heat stroke in Havanaafter the air conditioning failed on the expedition's Sovietairplane.   The dog named Apak was found dead in his cargo box Monday as theanimals were being taken to a zoo for temporary keeping, expeditionspokeswoman Cathy Saypol said Tuesday. Apak, who died Monday was oneof six reserve pullers being taken as backups to the expedition's 36first-string sled dogs.   ``The other 41 dogs were moved to a zoo in Havana and are doingfine,'' Saypol, who spoke with expedition organizer Will Steger,said from her New York office.   ``It's not a good way of starting,'' Steger, of Ely, Minn., tolda St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch reporter traveling with theexpedition. ``It's the worst thing that could happen outside oflosing a person. It's a shame for the dog, and it's a shame for theexpedition.''   The expedition originally had planned only a brief refueling stopin Havana before flying on to Lima, Peru, where the weather iscooler. However, the plane was held over in Havana for work on thesame problems that delayed the flight's departure fromMinneapolis-St. Paul International Airport by five hours Sunday.   The air conditioning broke down at the Havana airport andhandlers took the dogs to a cool spot at the zoo to escape humidweather with a high temperature of 87 degrees.   Steger and an international team of explorers plan to stop inPeru, Argentina and Chile before finally landing in Antarctica tostart its seven-month, 4,000-mile trip across the bottom of theworld on Aug. 1.   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snowtractors, but if it succeeds, this would be the first unmechanizedcrossing.   The team members are Steger, co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne ofFrance, Soviet scientist Victor Boyarsky, Englishman Geoff Somers,Keizo Funatsu of Japan, and Qin Dahe of China.</TEXT></DOC>
