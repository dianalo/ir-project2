The quarterly report showed a 1.1% increase in employer compensation for the three months ended in June. The first-quarter increase was only slightly higher at 1.2%, and for the year ended in June 1989, compensation costs rose 4.8%.    Employer costs for wages and salaries during the second quarter rose only 0.8%, with a 4.3% total increase for the year ended June.    &quot;Certainly we are continuing to see the same trend,&quot; said Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. Employer costs have been creeping up over the past few months, but the increases show no signs of exerting strong pressure for increased prices.    &quot;The growth rate is running right in line with inflation,&quot; said Brian Wesbury, vice president of Stotler Economics in Chicago. Consequently, increases in wages aren't leading to improved standards of living, nor are they forcing up the prices of consumer products.    Compensation for workers in private industry increased 1.2% from the first quarter, and 4.5% for the year ended in June. Wages and salaries for this group rose 1% during the second quarter, and 4.1% for the year, according to the report.    Private industry employers also spent slightly more for benefits in the second quarter. There was a 1.6% increase for the three-month period ended in June. For the year ended in June, the increase was 5.6%.    State and government employer compensation cost showed a 0.6% increase for the second quarter. For the year ended in June, the average rate of increase was 5.8%. Employment costs for wages and salaries were up 0.5% from the first quarter, and 5% for the year ended in June.    Employer compensation figures reflect all changes in wages and salaries and employer costs for employee benefits. The figures aren't adjusted for seasonal variations. </TEXT></DOC>
