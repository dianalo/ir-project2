Arco said that output in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay field, which accounts for about 20% of all domestic oil production, can &quot;no longer be sustained&quot; at an average rate of 1.5 million barrels a day and will average 1.45 million barrels a day this year.    Arco earlier had projected that the 1.5 million-barrel production rate could be maintained through 1989. Arco said it now expects 1989 production will be &quot;at or slightly below the 1988 level.&quot; Arco holds about a 22% interest in the field, Exxon Corp. has about 20% and British Petroleum Co. about 50%.    Year by year, Arco has extended the projected peak production for the giant Prudhoe Bay field, and analysts had forecast that the natural decline could be put off into the 1990s. Originally, Arco estimated that Prudhoe production would decline after 1984.    Various enhanced production techniques, together with some fortunate breaks with the vast 232,000-acre reservoir, have enabled oil producers to forestall the natural falloff. Now, while careful to avoid any suggestion of a rapid drop, Arco officials don't argue with suggestions that the field's output may slope gently downwards in the future.    As the field has aged, more and more natural gas is produced with the oil. Most of this gas must be reinjected into the ground, not only to sustain pressures in the reservoir but because there is no pipeline through which to export it. Arco and its partners are proceeding with a plan to boost the gas-handling capacity at Prudhoe to five billion cubic feet a day by the end of 1990, from 3.8 billion cubic feet currently. But that $350 million project won't allow the field to produce at the 1.5 million barrel-a-day rate in 1990, said Presley Foster, senior vice president, engineering, for Arco Alaska Inc.    Currently, total production of all liquids at Prudhoe -- including crude oil, natural gas liquids, and gas condensates -- totals about 1.57 million barrels a day. Arco's share of production from Alaskan oil fields has averaged 470,400 barrels a day of all liquids, including 313,400 daily from Prudhoe.    George Baker, an oil industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said the announcement marks the recognition by Arco of a long-expected decline in the &quot;main producing formation&quot; at Prudhoe Bay.    &quot;This is probably coming slightly before most people expected, but the issue is one that analysts have been thinking about for a long time,&quot; Mr. Baker said. The revised production estimates don't affect his earnings estimates for the company, he added.    Arco said that the revised production projections don't change its estimate of total reserves at the Prudhoe Bay field, but rather the rate at which those reserves can be brought to the surface. </TEXT></DOC>
