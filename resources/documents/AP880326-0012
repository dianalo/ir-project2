The New York Times, citing a forthcoming book and sources in theindustry, said IBM apparently believes the entire Americanelectronics industry could be weakened by growing dependence onJapanese semiconductor technology.   IBM's offer is reported in a book entitled ``Trading Places: HowWe Allowed Japan to Take the Lead,'' written by Clyde Prestowitzand scheduled for publication in late April, The Times said.   Prestowitz, formerly the Commerce Department's chief tradenegotiator with Japan, wrote that in mid-1987, IBM approachedDigital, ``its most dangerous domestic rival, and offered totransfer certain key technologies.   ``At first DEC suspected a trick, then it realized the objectivewas to prevent DEC from falling even further into Japanese hands,''Prestowitz wrote. His book does not elaborate on what technologywas offered or whether Digital accepted the offer, The Times said.   Spokesmen for IBM and Digital would not confirm whether suchtalks occurred, but other industry sources who declined to beidentified verified that IBM had made such an offer, the newspapersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
