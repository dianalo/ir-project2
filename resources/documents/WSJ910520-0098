The action by the Sejm, or lower house -- yet anotherdelay since the Senate cleared a similar measure in September-- was a rebuff to Poland's powerful Catholic bishops. Italso appeared to dash the bishops' hopes that parliament willabolish the 1956 law allowing abortion on demand before thelegislature dissolves for general elections due by October.   After months of heated disputes about the bill, whichwould have banned abortions and allowed two-year jail termsfor performing abortions, the Sejm's action shelved themeasure and an alternative proposal to hold an abortionreferendum. Polls show a majority of the public opposes thebill. But many in parliament agreed the overwhelminglyCatholic nation's easy-abortion law must be changed. Abouthalf of all pregnancies in Poland are aborted.   Parliament urged Warsaw to take action to changeattitudes, for example, by seeking a constitutional clause onlegally protecting conceived human life and a plan for sexeducation in schools.                                                                                                          LAND OF THE WANING SON?                                                                                                          Japan's falling birth rate could force some universitiesand colleges to cut staff or close by the year 2000, when thenumber of 18-year-old entrants is projected to drop 89,000,or 12%, to 649,000, from last year, a government advisorypanel said. The schools have expanded in the second postwarbaby-boom wave. But after peaking next year at 2.1 million,the number of those turning 18 is expected to dwindle to 1.5million by the end of this decade.                                                                                                          OECD ISSUES AN UPBEAT OUTLOOK                                                                                                          The Persian Gulf crisis-induced downturn in theindustrialized nations' economies won't have lasting effects,the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment said. Real growth, after stagnating in the firsthalf, could recover smartly in the second half to a 2.5%average annual inflation-adjusted rate of increase in grossnational product. This would make 1991 growth average 1%. TheOECD expects the 1992 rate to accelerate to 2.9%. Inflation,seen at 4.4% this year, could ease to 3.8% next year.                                                                                                          THE GREENING OF EUROPEAN OIL                                                                                                          European oil companies adopted &quot;guiding principles&quot; toprotect the environment, ranging from energy conservation tooperational standards, waste management and researchprograms. Developed by trade groups representing all oilcompanies with interests in Europe, the principles cover allthe industry's activities. The firms pledged to adopt morerigorous internal procedures to protect the environment andhealth and safety. The emphasis is on self-initiated actions,as well as cooperation with government.                                                                                                          SPAIN-BRAZIL TREATY SIGNED                                                                                                          Spain and Brazil signed guidelines for a five-year, $3billion cooperation treaty to provide state guarantees forforeign investment in both countries, and stimulate jointventures and public works programs, including roads andrailroads. The treaty includes $100 million for new commutertrains in Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and Curitiba. Spain isalready committed to improving rail links among SouthAmerican nations, including Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay andBrazil.                                                                                                          JAPANESE WAGES ROSE IN '90                                                                                                          Japanese workers last year were paid an average of 254,700yen ($1,854) a month. The 5.3% rise from a year earlier wasthe biggest in nine years, reflecting a labor shortage.Tokyo's annual report, based on wages each June excludingbonuses and overtime, showed women's average of 175,000 yenlagged far behind men's of 290,500 yen. But hourly pay forpart-time women averaged 712 yen ($5.18), up 7.6%, thebiggest jump in 13 years, topping 700 yen for the first time.                                                                                                          TAIWAN TO DROP SEDITION LAWS                                                                                                          Taiwan's parliament voted to repeal harsh sedition lawsthat critics said allowed the Nationalist Party to suppressdissent for four decades.   The laws were enacted during the 1949 civil war, when theNationalists lost to the Chinese Communists, and weredirected against spies and infiltrators.   The repeal is expected to get presidential approval laterthis month, transferring crimes under the sedition laws tocriminal statutes, which have less severe penalties. Chargesof sedition, theft of military and political secrets,providing funds to communists, and trying to overthrow thegovernment carry penalties of seven years in prison to death.Parliament decided the sedition measures were obsoletebecause of Taipei's move last month to end wartimeprovisions.   The repeal, analysts said, will allow more freedom ofspeech.
