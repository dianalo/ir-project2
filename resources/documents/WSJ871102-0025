The rating had been placed under review for possible downgrade on July 15, after Tyco announced its intention to acquire Atcor Inc. for about $142 million. Moody's said at the time that about $125 million in debt was affected. The rating agency said that Tyco's acquisition of Atcor, a maker of industrial and electrical products, will provide Tyco with additional lines of business compatible with Tyco's largest and fastest-growing segment, fire protection and flow control products. Although the acquisition has increased Tyco's leverage considerably, Moody's said it expected asset sales and cash-flow increases stemming from consolidations to allow Tyco to reduce its total debt over the intermediate term. </TEXT></DOC>
