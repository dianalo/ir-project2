The utility said it is offering the plan because weak economic conditions have led to a decline in sales of electricity and in the number of its customers.    The company said it is offering the plan to all employees 55 years or older with at least 10 years at the company. The company said, &quot;depending upon the acceptance of this plan by our employees, a layoff may or may not be needed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
