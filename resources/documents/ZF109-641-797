The appeals board ruled that thecontract, which among other things called for site licenses formicrocomputer software, be awarded to SMS Data Products Group Incalthough the company's bid was eliminated by Interior'scontracting officer because it failed to provide for sitelicenses.andP;  The Court of Appeals decided that the Board's decisionon the case was inappropriately based on its members' distaste forsite licenses, rather than on a legitimate assessment of thecontract's stipulations.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   SMS Data Products Group Inc.

 This hoary Latin legalism means the boarddoesn't have to defer to agency judgments, even on technical matters.andM;Some would say the board rarely gives the agency the benefit of the doubt.andM;A recent decision of the Court of appeals for the Federal Circuit may narrowthe board's review powers when a solicitation's specifications are inquestion.andP;  The decision, handed down Oct. 9, is Data General Corp. vs.andO;United States.andP;  It resulted from an appeal of a board decision in a bidprotest brought by SMS Data Products Group Inc. of Reston, Va.andM;During a procurement for microcomputers and minicomputers, the InteriorDepartment rejected the SMS best-and-final offer.andP;  Interior believed SMS'BAFO violated a mandatory specification that required &quot;unlimited use sitelicenses&quot; for software offered for the multiuser systems.andM;SMS had sought to limit its software licenses.andP;  First, it proposed a&quot;front-end, back-end&quot; approach under which some software functions would belicensed only for certain processors.andP;  The contracting officer decided thisviolated the solicitation requirement that all software be licensed for allprocessors.andM;Second, the license was tied to the number of users per system, not thenumber of computers.andP;  The contracting officer decided this was not the sameas a site license, because the SMS license did not cover the maximum possiblenumber of users per system.andM;When the contracting officer computed the cost of the licenses on a sitebasis, she found SMS was higher-priced than the competition.andP;  Aftereliminating SMS from consideration, Interior awarded the contract to DataGeneral.andM;The board overturned the agency's determination, and held that in thisprocurement, the terms users, workstations and processors were basicallyinterchangeable.andP;  In this view, SMS' attempt to license users was thereforeunderstandable and excusable, even if it limited the scope of the licenseoffered.andM;The board ordered Interior to reopen negotiations and determine whether itreally needed site license.andM;Unsatisfied, Data General appealed the adverse decision to the Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit.andP;  The appellate court reversed the board'sruling, reinstating the contract awarded to Data General.andM;The court held that the board's errors caused it to misinterpret thesolicitation and erroneously conclude that SMS' proposal was compliant.andP;  Thecourts also held that the solicitation very clearly required site licenses.andM;The court faulted the board's factual analysis as well as its reading of thesolicitation.andP;  According to the appellate opinion, SMS faxed a proposedsoftware license to the contracting officer, who replied that such a licensecould not be limited to a specific number of users per system.andP;  This put SMSon notice that its later &quot;clarification&quot; limiting software licenses on a peruser basis would disquaify its offer.andP;  The court said that the board had&quot;inexplicably&quot; ignored this exchange.andM;But most importantly, the court concluded that the board's analysis was&quot;infected&quot; by its belief that the agency did not really need site licenses.andM;In a statement with potentially significant importance, the court held thatit would be illegible for the board to impose upon the agency its own viewsof the agency's data processing needs.andM;This conclusion was based upon the following little-cited portion of theBrooks Act: The authority conferred upon the administrator [of the GeneralServices Administration] ...andP;  by this ection ...andP;  shall not be so construedas to impair or interfere with the determination by agencies of theirindividual ADP equipment requirements, including the development ofspecifications for and the selection of the types and configurations ofequipment needed [40 U.S.C.andP;  Section 759(e)].andM;Apparently the court reasoned that the board had no more power than the GSAadministrator.andP;  The court concluded that the board had overstepped itsauthority when evident distaste for the license specification led the boardto water down its significance.andM;The court's use of the Brooks Act language is portentous.andP;  The board has notbeen shy in overturning what it has seen as poor agency judgments ontechnical matters.andP;  These have sometimes included the selection andinterpretation of specifications.andM;Although the Data General decision does not revoke the board's de novoreview, it does sketch some outside boundaries to the scope of that review.andO;It is a sure bet that any agency before the board will cite this decision ifit feels its requirements and specifications are at issue.andM;We shall have to wait for future decisions to define just how far the boardcan go in reviewing and interpreting specifications.andP;  Ironically, underdogcompanies like Data General have benefited most from the board's activism,and they will have the most to lose if its powers are constricted.andM;Joseph J.
