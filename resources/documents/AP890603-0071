The Der Spiegel newsmagazine, which conducted the poll, said theonly West German politician more popular than Gorbachev isPresident Richard von Weizsaecker.   It augurs well for the Soviet leader's June 12-15 visit to thiscountry but could be ominous for Kohl, who faces federal electionsin 1990.   The magazine asked 2,000 West German voters to rate Gorbachevand West German politicians on a popularity scale from minus fiveto plus five.   Gorbachev received 2.2, while Kohl was rated at minus 0.6.   President Bush, who paid a 25-hour visit to West Germany lastweek, received 0.7, while French President Francois Mitterrand alsolagged behind Gorbachev with 1.7.   ``Even John F. Kennedy and Charles de Gaulle at their peaks werenot as popular as Gorbachev,'' Der Spiegel said.   Only Weizsaecker fared better than Gorbachev, the magazine said,but it did say what rating he received. The presidency is a mostlyceremonial post in West Germany.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who has been leadingWest German calls for closer ties to the Soviet Union and moredisarmament talks, received a 1.4 rating.   Der Spiegel said even West Germans who usually vote for Kohl'sconservative Christian Democratic Union rated Gorbachev nearly ashigh as the chancellor, giving Kohl 2.0 and Gorbachev 1.9.   Among those voters, 95 percent find Gorbachev farsighted, 94percent think he is full of ideas and 95 percent say he ishard-working, the magazine said.   A parallel survey was conducted for the magazine by theSociology Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which polled1,000 Moscow citizens.   Only 59 percent of those polled in Moscow said they areconvinced Gorbachev's reform policies will succeed, the magazinesaid. In the West German poll, 82 percent said they believeGorbachev will succeed.   According to Der Spiegel, 76 percent of Muscovites queriedreplied that ``perestroika will not be supported by the populationany more if the supply situation does not improve.''   It said 61 percent of Moscow residents polled think the Sovieteconomy is in ``bad or very bad'' shape.   Der Spiegel released a summary of the survey results in advanceof the magazine's publication Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
