The decision, by a 9-0 vote, isn't likely to cause a majorchange in the handling of lawsuits under Title VII of the1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits job bias. But it mayprompt plaintiffs to move some Title VII cases to statecourts.</LP><TEXT>   Last year, according to a recent federal courts study,more than 7,500 Title VII cases were filed in federal courts.Because the federal courts are devoting a growing percentageof their time to drug prosecutions, many Title VII cases facelong delays and mounting legal fees. Some state court systemsalso experience significant backlogs, but many states areable to handle civil lawsuits faster than the federal courts.In those states, filing Title VII complaints in state courtmay be an attractive option.   The decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens,resolves conflicting views among five federal appeals courts.Those in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Denver and Atlanta saidthat Title VII cases must be filed in federal court.   The fifth case was a ruling by the federal appeals courtin Chicago upholding an award of back pay and benefits ofabout $27,000 to a Chicago woman who sued Yellow FreightSystem Inc. alleging sex discrimination. The lawsuit wasfiled in state court; Yellow Freight moved it to federalcourt and asked that it be dismissed. The company argued thatwhile the case was pending improperly in state court, thelegal deadline for filing in federal court had passed.   But a federal judge, and the appeals court, refused todismiss the case, ruling that the filing in state court wasproper and within the deadline. Yesterday, the Supreme Courtaffirmed that ruling in Yellow Freight System Inc. vs.Donnelly.   The high court ruled that a state may make the drug peyoteillegal in all circumstances, including its use as areligious sacrament by members of the Native American Church.   In a 6-3 decision, the high court upheld an Oregon lawthat makes peyote, an hallucinogenic drug, illegal. Thecourt, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, saidthe First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom doesn'texcuse an individual from complying with a state's validcriminal laws. The high court noted that some states -- 11 byone estimate -- have made an exception to their drug laws forreligious use of peyote; but the court said the FirstAmendment doesn't require such an exception.   The Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendmentrights of two workers at a private drug rehabilitation clinicwere violated. They were fired for religious use of peyote,and were denied unemployment benefits due to theirmisconduct. But the high court yesterday reversed the statecourt ruling and said the workers' rights weren't violated inEmployment Division vs. Smith. Justice Harry A. Blackmundissented, joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and WilliamJ. Brennan Jr.</TEXT></DOC>
