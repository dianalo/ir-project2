Achille Occhetto, party secretary, said the shadow governmentwill be composed of both Communist Party officials and intellectualsor other specialists, and it will put forth ``policy andgovernmental proposals.''   Occhetto outlined the proposal in a speech opening the 18thcongress of the Italian Communist Party, or PCI, which is thecountry's second-largest party but has suffered a steady slide invotes.   Occhetto, who took the party reins last summer, called for achange in the composition of Italy's government, which for fourdecades has been dominated by the conservative Christian Democratswhile the Communists have been kept out of governing coalitions.   He appealed for new alliances with Roman Catholic groups and withlay parties, particularly the four parties in the current governingcoalition led by the Christian Democrats.   He also said the increasingly popular Green Party should lookbeyond ecological issues and team with parties committed towidespread reform.   Turning to foreign affairs, Occhetto said the Communists had aclear commitment to Italy's alliances with the West, particularlyNATO.   At the same time, he said, ``we want to develop in a more openand rich way a policy of dialogue and collaboration ... with theparty of (Soviet President) Mikhail Gorbachev, and with otherCommunist parties committed to the democratization of the countriesthey govern.''   The Italian Communist Party broke with the Soviet Union in the1970s and has since pursued its own course, which included an effortto rule with the Christian Democrats in the mid-70s. Occhettosuggested Saturday that that effort _ known as the ``historiccompromise'' _ was mistaken.   The party has declined steadily in the polls over the pastdecade, winning just 26.6 percent of the vote in parliamentaryelections in 1987 after nearly overtaking the Christian Democrats in1976.   Communist party members gathered in a Rome convention hallapplauded Occhetto when he called for the political rehabilitationof Alexander Dubcek, the former Czechoslovak Communist Party leaderwho introduced the ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms.   Dubcek was invited to the congress but Czechoslovak authoritiesdid not grant him a visa.</TEXT></DOC>
