Brown.andM;Full T1 is 1.544Mbits per second.andP;  Fractional T1 allows customers to buyindividual 64Kbit-per-second (64Kbps) channels, bundling them to form128Kbps, 256Kbps, 384Kbps and 768Kbps circuits, company officials said.andM;Affordable ApplicationsandM;A major benefit for end users, company officials said, is the ability to addlocations and applications to their networks at affordable prices.andM;Combining fractional T1 and full T1 lines provides a method for buildinghybrid networks that include features of both public and private networks.andO;This is accomplished using dedicated private facilities as well as variouspublic facilities, explained Gregory Langford, Timeplex's director of productmarketing.andM;Timeplex officials described the similarities between the Integrated ServicesDigital Network (ISDN) and fractional T1.andM;&quot;In a sense, ISDN is fractional T1 with signaling,&quot; Langford said, explainingthat, in ISDN, one of the 64Kbps channels is used to signal into the networkto make connections at nearly real-time speeds.andM;&quot;Fractional T1 is the precursor to ISDN.andP;  The more subscribers [there are] onfractional T1, the more will go over to full ISDN,&quot; Brown said.andM;Fractional T1 services, called E-1 or channelized services, are alreadyavailable in Canada, France and Japan.andP;  Many European countries are expectedto begin offering E-1 within the year, according to Timeplex officials.andM;Noting that 50 percent of Timeplex's business is international, Brown saidTimeplex already has experience in developing channelized services abroad.andM;Company officials said they expect ATandamp;T and the regional Bell operatingcompanies to begin offering fractional T1 services soon.andP;  Offering theservices involves &quot;simple modification&quot; to the companies' DACS equipment,according to the officials.andM;Timeplex customers who currently have the Link system can purchase plug-inmodules to upgrade to fractional T1.andP;  The modules range from $5,000 to$8,000.andM;Enhancements to Link also include standard sub-rate multiplexing,broadcast/polling and T1 access to switched 56Kbps services.andP;  Timeplex hasalso increased the maximum number of nodes on a Link network from 160 to 252.andM;Timeplex Inc. can be contacted at 400 Chestnut Ridge Road, Woodcliff Lake, NJ07675, (201) 391-1111.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
