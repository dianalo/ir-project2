New FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, fulfilling the promises of hispredecessor, Dennis Patrick, said Thursday that beginning Jan. 1,1991, many local phone companies will switch from the current``rate-of-return'' pricing system to an incentive-based regulationknown as price caps.   In the meantime, these companies will continue under therate-of-return formula that allows them to earn 12 percent abovetheir investments, the FCC decided in a 4-0 vote.   Price caps will apply to the revenues local phone companiescollect from connecting their callers with long-distance companies.Local phone companies with more than $100 million in annualrevenues will fall under price caps, which the FCC says is designedto lower phone rates.   When the FCC imposed price caps on the American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. this year after two decades of rate-of-returnregulation, it said consumers would reap $900 million in savingsover the next four years as ATandamp;T raised or lowered rates withincertain inflation-based price bands.   Rate of return for the local companies, which was due to expireDec. 31, will continue into next year pending completion of a morecomprehensive study of the process.   Sikes said the price cap ``is the best available means ofensuring the United States the kind of efficient and effectivetelecommunications system that it needs.''   Local phone companies have been earning 12 percent since 1986,which a consumer advocate said was too high under current marketconditions.   ``The record clearly shows the rate of return should bereduced,'' Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of Americasaid following the commission's vote. ``Consumers ought to beseeing rates coming down because the companies' earnings areexcessive. ... Here was a chance to cut out the fat.''   But the commission said the 12 percent rate was still ``just andreasonable.''   Patrick, the former FCC chairman, had said earlier this year hewanted price caps for the local phone companies, but his aggressivederegulatory approach ruffled many feathers in Congress.   Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau,said Thursday he had ``every expectation of being able to worksuccessfully with Congress.''   Sikes made clear he was unsatisfied with the amount ofinvestment the local phone companies have been making in newfacilities and equipment under the current rate-of-return process.   ``This past fall, when I addressed the U.S. TelephoneAssociation convention in San Francisco, I questioned the level ofindustry investment in new plant and facilities,'' Sikes said.``Since then, many companies have assured me that their plans for1990 and beyond involve stepped-up modernization programs.''   Sikes, noting his previous experience as overseer of theMissouri Public Service Commission, said the cost-plus approach topricing used there ``ill-served the consumer.''   Firestone said the FCC expected to adopt a price cap scheme bythe fall of next year, while also completing its rate-of-returnstudy at about the same time.   Local phone companies must file comments on the presentrate-of-return scheme by Feb. 16.</TEXT></DOC>
