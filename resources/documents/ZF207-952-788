Hug discusses the currentdevelopments in the low, medium and high ends of the laser printermarket.andP;  At the high end, volume of printing is a more criticalfactor than speed.andP;  High-end printers most commonly use seleniumfor their photoconductor, either helium-cadmium or air-cooledargon lasers.andP;  Low-end printers use diode lasers, and mid-rangemodels are moving in that direction.andP;  The helium-neon laser (HeNe)is encroaching upon the high-end machines, however the doublediode-pumped Nd:YAG laser continues to be prohibitively expensive.andO;Changing technologies among laser printers are in improvedphotoconductor technology rather than with the laser itself.andP;  Themajority of activity in the color separation market is occurringat the low end.andP;  Color separators are expected to move towards redor infrared diode lasers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     InterviewLaser PrintersComputer GraphicsImage ProcessingColorMarket AnalysisTechnologyTrends.andO;Person:    Hug, William F.
