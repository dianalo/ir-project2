Hong Kong is due to be handed over to China in 1997, and fearsthat China will not honor an agreement to preserve the colony'scapitalist system for 50 years increased after the violent crackdownon pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing.   In a 90-minute emergency meeting, Governor Sir David Wilson saidhe told Mrs. Thatcher that granting the right of entry to Chinesecarrying British passports ``would do an immense amount of good inHong Kong.''   Wilson, speaking to reporters outside Mrs. Thatcher's 10 DowningStreet residence, said Mrs. Thatcher replied ``that would be amatter of grave political difficulty,'' while reiterating promisesto be more flexible.   Thousands of Hong Kong Chinese, usually the better off and besteducated, have already emigrated, mainly to Canada, Australia andthe United States.   Mrs. Thatcher this week ruled out allowing large-scaleimmigration from Hong Kong but promised to be more ``flexible''about special categories, such as senior public servants and peoplewith private incomes.</TEXT></DOC>
