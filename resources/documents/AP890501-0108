Ed Wolfe, ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said he delivereda note of protest to an official of the Taiwanese CoordinatingCouncil for North American Affairs and warned of the possiblefallout if the government of Taiwan fails to negotiate a driftnetfishing agreement with the United States.   ``I delivered a forceful message regarding the potential seriousconsequences of recent illegal fishing activities and the lack ofTaiwanese cooperation on driftnet negotiations, specifically theenforcement aspect of those negotiations,'' said Wolfe.   Wolfe said he told the Taiwanese that the fishing issue hasattracted interest at the ``highest levels'' of the StateDepartment and called for an ``immediate resumption of negotiationsto avoid potential bilateral foreign policy problems.''   The meeting Friday came about a week after the Coast Guardboarded a Taiwanese ship suspected of illegal driftnet fishing forsalmon in the North Pacific.   The ship was spotted 450 miles outside the legal driftnetfishing zone in waters where the Taiwanese government itself hasbanned driftnetting. The ship allegedly cut its net and fled afterbeing spotted by the cutter Jarvis.   The Jarvis shadowed the vessel for almost 700 miles beforereceiving permission from the Taiwanese government to board.   Wolfe said Monday that a fish scale and fin found on the shiphave been sent to a National Marine Fisheries Service laboratory tosee if they were from a salmon of North American origin.   American fishermen claim vessels from Taiwan, South Korea andJapan use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of salmonunder the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have said theillegal fishing has already hurt salmon runs in Alaska, Washingtonstate and Oregon.   Driftnets can stretch 35 miles in length and cover more than30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day. Environmentalistclaim the nets are responsible for the deaths of thousands ofporpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life annually.</TEXT></DOC>
