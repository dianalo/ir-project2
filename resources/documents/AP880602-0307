The Saudi order, approved by Congress last month, representsChicago-based FMC's first foreign sales of its Bradley FightingVehicle and could open the door for similar sales to other friendlycountries in the region, a spokeswoman said.   ``Sure, it's a possibility,'' said FMC spokeswoman PatriciaBrozowski. ``It's hard to judge right now what the overallpotential is but we'll certainly see what happens.''   The previously announced $1 billion deal calling for FMC andNurol Defense Industry to produce 1,700 smaller armored vehiclesfor the Turkish government is a ``crucial element'' of Tukey'sdefense-modernization plan, said FMC Chairman Robert H. Malott.   ``Through participation in this contract ... FMC-Nurol willcontribute to Turkey's economic dynamism,'' Malott said in remarksprepared for an afternoon signing ceremony with Turkish PrimeMinister Turgut Ozal in New York.   ``Meanwhile, the U.S. economy will benefit from the sale of someU.S.-produced components to Turkey,'' Malott said.   FMC, a leader in armored-vehicle manufacturing and technology,produced the Turkish army's exisiting fleet of M113 personnelcarriers. The new contract is for Armored Infantry FightingVehicles, which are popular because they can operate in waterwithout add-on flotation devices and are small enough to betransported in C-130 class aircraft.   The vehicles have 25mm cannons and the capacity to carry 10people at a maximum speed of 45 mph.   The agreement calls for FMC-Nurol to deliver 1,700 vehicles overan eight-year period from the joint venture's manufacturing plantin Turkey. The percentage of the vehicles' content produced inTurkey will steadily rise to 73 percent in the last contract year,Malott said.   FMC will own 51 percent of FMC-Nurol and hold a majority of thepositions on the joint venture's board, he said.   The agreement represents one of the largest joint venturesundertaken by FMC, which has previously co-produced armored troopcarriers in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, Malott said.   The sale of 200 Bradley vehicles to Saudi Arabia, withdeliveries expected to begin in 1990, expands FMC's customer basefor Bradleys beyond the Pentagon for the first time.   The Pentagon has purchased about 3,400 of the vehicles since theearly 1980s, Ms. Brozowski said.   The Bradley, touted by Malott as ``the Mercedes Benz of itstype'' but reviled by some military critics, is equipped withsurface-to-surface rocket launchers and 25mmm cannons.   The Saudi order also specifies that the Bradleys beair-conditioned.   ``Deserts, you know,'' said Ms. Brozowski.</TEXT></DOC>
