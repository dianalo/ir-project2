At least that's the hope of investors in tiny ICC, whichisn't yet profitable but is already valued at $40 million bythe stock market.</LP><TEXT>   What ICC has developed is a simple technology for reducingthe peak-load demands of such big electricity users assupermarkets, department stores and fast-food restaurants.   The approach involves putting a garage-sized box ofmachinery on the roof that can pull humidity out of thebuilding and cleanse the air before sending it back inside.ICC's product cools air in the summer, heats it in winter,and dries it on muggy days, regardless of the season.   Dry air is much easier to cool than moist air, sorefrigeration equipment doesn't have to work nearly as hard.Lower humidity in a grocery store or department store alsomeans that customers can shop more comfortably. The nation's30,000 supermarkets consume about 2% of the total electricityproduced in the U.S. every year. The potential for energysavings is high.   &quot;Energy conservation is coming back as a policy issue,&quot;says Keith H. Cox, ICC's chief financial officer. &quot;Electricutilities used to view conservation as an anathema because itmeant lower revenues. But now, they're being rewarded formaking investments that help their customers conserveenergy.&quot;   Among ICC's customers are J.C. Penney Co., the ShopRitedivision of Village Super Market Inc., and First NationalSupermarkets Inc. For example, First National, which is basedin Windsor Locks, Conn., has five of ICC's rooftop units online and an additional 24 on order.   Irwin L. Gross, ICC's chairman and chief executiveofficer, says he is optimistic about substantial new ordersfrom all three customers. In addition, ICC is working oninitial agreements with at least one fast-food chain and amajor hotel. Mr. Gross declined to identify them.   Aided by these prospects and a growing backlog of orders,now at $2.5 million, the company expects to turn profitableby the end of 1991. ICC, which got its start as a maker ofco-generation units, went public in 1985. A simple unitdesigned for a small restaurant costs about $55,000. Largerand more elaborate systems may cost as much as $400,000.   Last year, the company had a net loss of $3.6 million onsales of about $1 million. ICC has about 5.4 million sharesoutstanding, which would indicate a market capitalization ofabout $40.5 million, based on Friday's close stock price of 71/2 bid.   Moreover, ICC's desiccant/cogeneration units are beingwelcomed by the natural gas industry. The company hasdeveloped a cooperative advertising campaign with theAmerican Gas Association. In addition, many local gas andelectric utilities are offering cash rebates to eligible ICCcustomers.   The company envisions even greater involvement withutilities as investment incentives for conservation continueto spread. For example, Mr. Cox noted that Californiaregulators recently authorized about $500 million of utilityrate-base allowances over the next 28 months, designed tospur new conservation investment.   ICC's rooftop units, powered by natural gas, can help keepthe inside of buildings more comfortable by providingindependent temperature and humidity control. The systemdoesn't require any chemicals, ozone-erodingchlorofluorocarbons or hydrochlorofluorocarbons. What's more,Mr. Gross says the units can cut a building'sair-conditioning costs in half and reduce its total energyconsumption by as much as 15%.   The units dehumidify the air and cool it for recirculationwhile eliminating odors and killing bacteria and fungi. Onhot days, the desiccant machines feed dry air into abuilding's existing air conditioners. On cold days, theunit's own waste heat can be used to warm up air and water,supplementing a building's thermal needs. On rainy days, thedessicant machines dehumidify the air.   With less-humid air, Mr. Gross says supermarkets have beenable to save 30 kilowatts to 45 kilowatts of demand byturning off door heaters on frozen-food cases and adjustingrefrigeration units that no longer face the problem of frostbuildup.   Since the fourth quarter of 1989, the company hasredirected its business strategy to concentrate on desiccantdehumidification systems. The company, which designs andmaintains its units, gains a marketing advantage by beingable to sell its products to entire retail chains instead ofhaving to make separate sales pitches to each store.   Earlier this year, the company began streamliningoperations, Mr. Gross says. Reductions in general,administrative and sales expenses have trimmed monthlyoverhead by about 50%, thereby reducing the level of salesneeded to reach break-even. In addition, ICC has eliminatedabout $500,000 in yearly lease payments and is expected tocut future lease payments totaling $2.1 million over the nextsix years.   In August, ICC made a rights offering for about $3 millionof common stock to provide operating capital, expand staffand undertake in-house production that had been subcontractedin the research and development stages.   Mr. Gross says the company's improved operating efficiencyand the growing backlog of business will open up new markets.As examples, he cites nursing homes, office buildings andhotels.   In addition, new environmental standards have boosted thenumber of times air must be exchanged in a building to avoid&quot;sick building syndrome.&quot; ICC believes this new requirementwill double existing air-conditioning loads. That factorcould increase the appeal of the company's machines.   The company currently has three models, which can each befitted with a cogeneration plant able to produce as much as150 kilowatts of electricity. Mr. Gross says a smaller,lighter and more efficient prototype should be in productionby 1991.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Investors sold over-the-counter stocks as Chase ManhattanCorp. slashed its dividend and said it would cut 5,000employees, adding to market worries about the economy and theMideastern conflict.
