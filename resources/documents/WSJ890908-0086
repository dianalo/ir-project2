At least that's the argument of the Prospector Fund, a gold stock fund that reimbursed its shareholders for losses from a portfolio manager's fraud, but now its founder is facing a stiff penalty anyway.    The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday capped a 2 1/2 year investigation by approving an administrative order that imposes a fine of $52,234 on Prospector's founder Clark Aylsworth. The order also permanently bars him from any supervisory or managerial position at a mutual fund.    Mr. Aylsworth, in consenting to the order, neither admitted nor denied the SEC accusations that he violated anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law.    The case stems from an elaborate fraud by Prospector's former portfolio manager that cost fund investors about $16 million. The fund disclosed the problem to the SEC, fired the manager in 1985, and beefed up its internal controls. Moreover, shareholders in the fund have since been repaid about $18 million, representing losses and interest, in three distribution checks.    The severity of the SEC action startled some industry executives because the fund's shareholders have been fully repaid. And Mr. Aylsworth argues that the case could discourage mutual funds from settling with shareholders and paying them back if they're defrauded.    &quot;The lesson to be learned by the industry is that if you have a problem, you are better off to stonewall it,&quot; Mr. Aylsworth says. &quot;Don't provide disclosure, because they will only use it against you.&quot;    The SEC, which hasn't yet publicly released the order, declined to comment.    Prospector Fund has been a hot performer lately. This year through August it had a 16% return-price change plus dividends -- the best of 35 gold funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. The SEC tends to be more lenient on funds when they act vigorously to clean up their own house, says Charles Padgett, a former SEC administrator who currently is general counsel for J.andamp; W. Seligman andamp; Co. But if SEC staffers believe a fund officer hasn't acted quickly or in good faith, the penalties often are harsher.    &quot;If you're brought in screaming and shouting, you're not given a whole lot of credit,&quot; Mr. Padgett says.    The SEC contended that Mr. Aylsworth, while having nothing to do directly with the fraud, knew of some of the violations in late 1984 and early 1985, well before disclosing the problem to the SEC -- a position Mr. Aylsworth vehmently denies.    In the settlement, the SEC accuses Mr. Aylsworth of failing to properly supervise the fund when its former portfolio manager defrauded shareholders. The former manager, Carl Lazzell, is out of prison after serving a jail term. A Canadian court found that Mr. Lazzell was bribed by two Canadian stock promoters to buy millions of dollars of worthless stock for the fund on the Vancouver Stock Exchange.    As part of the order, the fund has launched programs to detect any future abuses. Those programs include an inhouse auditor and counsel, plus a full-time compliance officer.    The order also accuses United Services Advisors Inc., the fund's adviser, of violating anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law. And the order forces Mr. Aylsworth to &quot;pursue the sale, merger or acquisition&quot; of United Services or the sale of his equity holdings in the firm.    &quot;We certainly welcome this opportunity to bring this chapter to a close,&quot; says Bobby Duncan, United Services' president and chief executive. &quot;The company is poised to move forward into the 1990s a stronger and wiser organization.&quot;    The fund already has notified shareholders that it reached a definitive agreement to sell a controlling block of stock to Frank Holmes, an officer of Merit Investment Corp., a Toronto investment dealer. The fund also told holders that Mr. Aylsworth will continue as a consultant to the fund.    In addition to barring Mr. Aylsworth from acting in a supervisory or managerial role in any mutual fund, the order forces him to pay $52,234 to United Services. That figure represents profits he may have made on the sale of his United Services stock when that company went public in 1985, before the fraud was disclosed. </TEXT></DOC>
