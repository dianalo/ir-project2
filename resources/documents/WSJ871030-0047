Many traders buy precious metals as an inflation hedge. Much of the day's trading activity was sparked by long liquidation, or traders selling contracts to offset those bought earlier.    The apparent central-bank gold sales, although impossible to verify, were triggered by attempts by central banks to support the U.S. dollar, according to many traders.    But some analysts suggested that such selling was minimal. Central-bank selling &quot;was about as unaggressive in gold as it has been in purchases of dollars recently,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc., New York.    Still, gold contracts for December delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York tumbled $11.80 an ounce, to $468.70. December silver prices on the Comex plunged 47 cents, to $6.925. Platinum futures prices for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank $25, to $526.90.    The sharper declines in silver and platinum reflected their additional roles as industrial metals amid signs that the economy could weaken from recent stock-market instability, some traders said.    &quot;Gold, as a safe haven, has been the steadiest performer,&quot; said Steven Pepper, senior vice president at Republic National Bank of New York.    Some analysts suggested that gold will continue to outpace silver and platinum until the economy's course becomes clearer.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    SUGAR: Futures prices eased despite improved demand. The March contract declined 0.10 cent a pound to 7.50 cents, just above the day's low. Analysts and trade sources said the Soviet Union -- which is having problems with cold and wet weather in sugar-growing and cotton-growing areas, and is experiencing increased domestic-sugar use -- was seeking to buy as much as 500,000 metric tons of raw sugar. According to one dealer, the Soviets have already bought an estimated 125,000 tons and are seeking the rest. &quot;They buy in small quantities, over a period of time,&quot; he said. In addition, he said, Venezuela this week purchased 36,000 tons of refined sugar and is looking for an additional 50,000 tons. The pickup in demand hasn't had much of an impact on the futures market because &quot;the effect of the recent stock-market setback is continuing to dampen speculative participation,&quot; the dealer said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-futures prices finished mixed. The contract for December settlement fell by its permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound before settling at 63.50 cents a pound, down 0.35 cents. Weak prices for carcass and boxed beef made traders jittery early in the day, analysts said. But a late rally and short-covering -- or traders buying back positions they previously sold -- contributed to the rebound. Hog futures finished mixed, as traders took their cues from the cattle pit, analysts said.    COPPER: Selling influenced by declines in precious-metals futures interrupted a two-day copper rally and depressed prices. December-delivery copper fell 1.35 cents a pound to 79.65 cents. Price-supporting factors continued to develop in copper, but for yesterday, at least, their impact was overcome by the plunge in precious-metals prices, which triggered sympathetic selling in copper, an analyst said. The rapid decline in Commodity Exchange warehouse-copper stocks continued as they fell 1,789 tons to 67,191 tons. In addition, the analyst said, a strike over higher-wage demands touched off a walkout of 1,200 workers at Southern Peru Copper Co.'s Cuajone, Peru, copper mine. The strike was expected to spread to the company's Toquepala mine Monday. </TEXT></DOC>
