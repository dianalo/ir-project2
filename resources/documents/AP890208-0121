The official China Daily on Wednesday quoted population expertsas blaming administrators for not holding down population growth.The experts discounted government arguments the recent surge in thegrowth rate was due to a baby boom.   China, the world's most populous nation, has about 1.09 billionpeople.   Yu Jingyuan, senior engineer of the Beijing Institute ofInformation and Control, was quoted as saying the target of 1.2billion people by the year 2000 could have been met if thegovernment had adhered to its one-child policy.   Yu said stricter controls must be placed on rural families.   The 1980 policy of limiting each couple to one child generallyhas been successful in crowded urban areas but has met strongresistance in the countryside, where couples want more children,particularly sons, to help in the fields and care for them when theybecome old.   Newly affluent farmers are often willing to pay large fines forhaving two or three children. Many rural areas have relaxed theone-child policy to allow couples whose first child is a girl tryfor a boy.   The nationwide growth rate climbed from 11 per thousand in 1985to 14.1 in 1986 and 16.2 last year. Family planning officials havesaid the main cause of the climbing growth rate is that a baby boomgeneration from the early 1960s has reached child-bearing age.</TEXT></DOC>
