(products).andO;Product:   More II (Presentation software).andO;Topic:     Presentation SoftwareEvaluation.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Graphics, outlines, slides, color and MOREandM;The new genre of desktop presentation programs has been called a class ofproducts in search of a market.andP;  Well, the buyers finally seem to be ready,and so are some of the biggest players in the software publishing industry.andM;But these programs still address a very narrowly defined niche.andP;  Quitesimply, unless you have to produce presentations using slides, transparenciesor on-screen displays, there doesn't seem to be much point in owning one ofthese software packages -- that is, unless the product can do all that andmore.andP;  Symantec's MORE II lives up to its name.andM;A historical outline.andP;  A few short years ago -- when &quot;presentations&quot; werecalled slides, &quot;idea organizers&quot; were called outliners and the encompassingtechnology didn't even have a name -- one company pioneered a new breed ofsoftware.andM;Living Videotext, now a part of Symantec Corp., developed the first popularmicrocomputer outliner, ThinkTank, and brought it to the fledgling Macintoshin 1984.andP;  The product evolved along with the Mac, and its 1986 offspring,MORE, introduced a revolutionary concept: the ability to generate bullet andtree charts automatically, based on outlines.andP;  Desktop presentations wereborn.andM;Now, the people who &quot;wrote the book&quot; have begun shipping MORE II, and it'sone program that deserves the Roman numeral superlative.andP;  Rather than showany age lines due to its long history -- or, for that matter, the lack ofmaturity of some of its neophyte rivals -- MORE II is a modern and worthysuccessor that once again redefines what a presentation package can andshould be.andM;What it is -- and isn't.andP;  Attempting to pigeon-hole MORE II as just anoutliner or desktop presentation product misses the point.andP;  MORE II is auniquely integrated program that melds outlining, organizing, wordprocessing, color graphics, presentation and slide show technologies into apackage that's truly greater than the sum of its parts.andM;All desktop presentation programs claim to relieve you of the arduous tasksof creating visuals so that you can concentrate on their content.andP;  But thewriting tools they offer vary quite a bit.andP;  Actually, most of these programsconcentrate on the delivery of presentations rather than their conception,planning and organization.andP;  It's in these areas that MORE II outdistances thecompetition, largely as a result of its outlining ancestry.andM;Like the outliner in the original MORE, the new program offers all the basicorganizational functions such as moving headlines, changing their levelwithin the outline's hierarchical structure and expanding or collapsing themon screen.andP;  You can sort outline elements, &quot;hoist,&quot; or isolate, them from therest of the outline, and clone them with dynamic links to the originalelement.andP;  Any number of headlines can be marked and gathered when you want tomove, copy or clone them as a group to another part of the outline.andM;MORE II also has tools with which you can dial any phone number in an outlinethrough a modem; generate a calendar outline for any range of dates; add andsubtract number, time or dollar figures to generate subtotals and totals; andinsert the current date and time.andP;  The lack of a functional Undo command,which was the major shortcoming of previous versions of MORE, has beencorrected.andP;  Additionally, MORE II can now wrap headline text onto continuinglines containing multiple fonts, sizes, styles and colors.andM;The document-oriented word processing features in MORE II let you format allaspects of text appearance, including eight-bit color, and the overalldocument layout, including margins, page breaks, headers and footers.andP;  MOREII has an integrated, 100,000-word spelling checker and the ability toautomatically generate tables of contents.andP;  The very usefulsearch-and-replace function lets you mark the text it finds for latergathering and even does complex text-pattern matching with a generouscollection of wild-card characters.andM;The program can import and export Microsoft Word 3, Claris' MacWrite 4.5 andplain text files as well as files from other Symantec products: MORE 1.X andThinkTank 2.0 for the Mac and ThinkTank 2.0 and Ready! for IBM PCs andclones.andM;MORE II does lack some functions that you might find in a full-featured wordprocessor.andP;  We could easily build a wish list of such high-end items, likethe ability to search for or replace text attributes (font, size, style andcolor) and a mechanism to split windows or open multiple copies of the samedocument.andP;  We understand the program's authors had to draw the line at somepoint before attempting to make it a total word processor replacement, butMORE II would have particularly benefited from these two additions.andM;Rules and libraries.andP;  Users will likely find MORE II's new Rules to be theprogram's most flexible new feature.andP;  Rules are style sheets that you can useto apply saved formats, globally or selectively, to outlines, bullet chartsor tree charts.andP;  They can apply to any outline or chart element; to a rangeor group of elements, such as a specified range of outline levels; and toheadlines, document text, or both.andM;Rules can be named and saved in libraries, along with outline templates,bullet-chart objects, and bit-mapped or object-oriented graphics.andP;  Librariesare actually disk files that can contain these collections of information,accessible from within any MORE II document.andP;  Although only one library canbe open at a time, a stand-alone utility lets you consolidate or subdividelibraries and move items (Rules or graphics) from one library to another.andM;Rules and libraries act as templates of different sorts, and their valueincreases as you collect and store the items, layouts and formats you usemost often.andP;  For work groups, such templates are a tremendous aid in sharingand standardizing documents and presentations.andM;The only weakness we observed in this otherwise powerful set of tools is thatRules are not dynamically linked to the names under which they are saved.andO;That is, if you change the definition of a set of Rules as it applies to oneitem, other items with the same named set of Rules are not automaticallyupdated.andP;  Nevertheless, they are quite useful and help to mitigate MORE II'sinability to search for and replace text attributes, as well as its lack of adedicated glossary feature.andM;Presentations.andP;  MORE II can instantly transform any outline, or part of anoutline, into a so-called bullet chart (the type of output we usuallyassociate with individual slides or overhead transparencies) or into a singletree chart, such as the familiar organizational chart.andP;  When an outline isdisplayed in bullet- or tree-chart view, a set of object-oriented drawingtools unique to the chart type becomes available.andM;You won't find many of the sophisticated graphic tools and functions, likepolygon and freehand tools, we've come to expect in drawing programs or theability to group and lock objects.andP;  MORE II compensates for some of thesemissing features by providing the ability to import PICT, PICT2 and EPS filesfrom other applications.andP;  Surprisingly, although it can scale importedgraphics, MORE II cannot crop them.andM;Another major feature omitted from MORE II, and one found in some of itscompetitors, is a self-contained module for creating graphs (pie, bar andcolumn) from tabular data.andP;  Apparently, Symantec made the strategic decisionto bolster its strengths -- outlining and organizing -- and to leave graphingfunctions to dedicated programs like spreadsheets, which most business usersalready own.andP;  We concur that for most users, this trade-off is acceptable,but for some it may be a real disappointment.andM;Rather than trying to implement every possible graphic feature, MORE IIconcentrates on the basics and on advanced tools uniquely suited to itsbullet and tree charts.andP;  For example, in bullet-chart mode, the programoffers special shadowing, border and background effects; for tree charts, ithas special chart-orientation, clustering and alignment effects.andM;MORE II also enhances its graphics capabilities with some very nice touches:master pages for consistency of placement; support of eight-bit color on theMac II; and, of course, the flexibility of Rules and libraries.andP;  Symantecprovides many sample layouts, backgrounds and graphics with MORE II.andP;  Perhapsthey're not as flashy as some competitors' instant templates -- the &quot;plug inyour content and you're ready to print&quot; variety -- but this reflects MOREII's do-it-yourself philosophy rather than any inherent relative limitations.andM;You can enhance on-screen slide show presentations in MORE II with a pleasingvariety of special effects, like dissolves and wipes.andP;  A Presentation ControlPanel dialog box lets you direct the timing and sequencing of the slide show.andO;If you're using a two-monitor configuration, you can move the Control Panelto the second screen, along with any speaker's notes you've created inspecial MORE II windows.andP;  The program also supports the Kodak DatashowPresentation Remote from Eastman Kodak of Rochester, N.Y., a device thatenables you to control your slide shows remotely.andM;MORE II supports all of Apple's printers as well as other QuickDraw andPostScript devices.andP;  It can output to film recorders like Montage fromPresentation Technologies of Sunnyvale, Calif.; FilmPrinter from Mirus Corp.andO;of Los Altos, Calif.; And SlideWriter from Matrix Instruments of Orangeburg,N.Y.andP;  In addition, MORE II includes information on Symantec's agreement withMAGICorp of Elmsford, N.Y., a service bureau that will receive your MORE IIfiles electronically and return completed slides, transparencies or printedcolor output to you via next-day courier.andM;Documentation and support.andP;  MORE II's excellent manuals and context-sensitiveon-line help system are among its greatest strengths.andP;  The 154-page tutorialmanual serves both novice and experienced Mac users and will painlessly makeanyone fluent with the basics of this complex program.andP;  The extensive,406-page reference guide is arranged alphabetically by program feature and isas clear, thorough and well-illustrated as any we've seen.andM;The program also includes a laminated Quick Reference chart and a 44-pagebooklet, &quot;Presenting with MORE II,&quot; which explains not only the mechanics butalso the fundamental thinking and organizing that goes into makinghigh-quality presentations.andM;Symantec provides unlimited technical support to registered MORE II users.andO;Calls are not toll-free, but we found the level of assistance to be high, andsupport personnel were knowledgeable, responsive and courteous.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Pioneering software products like VisiCalc or WordStar oftenfade in popularity because they aren't able to rise to the challenges of theemerging market they helped spawn.andP;  Fortunately, that's not the case with theMORE II lineage.andM;Its name may be somewhat redundant, but if anyone deserves a round ofself-congratulation, it is Symantec.andP;  It has taken a first-class product andmade it even better.andP;  Whether or not you ever need to produce a presentation,MORE II will certainly pay you back with interest.andP;  It's the best outliner,organizer and writing aid around, as well as an excellent presentation tool,and we don't hesitate to give it our highest recommendation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
