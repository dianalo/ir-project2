<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0242 </DOCNO><TEXT>Extensive preparatory investigations have been made for this project thatrefer to choosing the proper source of radionuclide excitation, the detector/sample/sourcearrangement, and the collimation of source and detector. Optimized measuringarrays using Ba-133 (10 mCi) or Ir-192 (10 Ci), respectively for X-rayK-line excitation have been set up and used for determining calibrationcurves for the analysis of U, Np, and Pu in solutions that vary in concentrationover several orders of magnitude. A measuring system has been built upfor analysing solutions flowing through a pipe system. The measuringsystem consists of a sample chamber, 2 pumps, 2 rotameters, 2 solutioncontainers and a mixing chamber, allowing continuous concentration measurement.The high-purity Ge detector is placed at the pipe system. Multi-channelanalysis is done on a self-made, computer-integrated RAM buffer frame.The results can be displayed, printed out, or plotted, and can also beused for process control. For evaluation of the X-ray or {gamma}-spectra,the digital filter method is applied.</TEXT></DOC>
