For almost a century now,scientists and engineers all over the world have and are still workingtowards an optimized[fuel management system] (FMS) for automobiles. Theystill have a long way to go in order to totally eliminate unburned hydrocarbonsand all other [harmful emissions]. Not only are these emissions harmfulto the environment, they also reveal the degree of inefficiency of gasolineengines. (This paper discusses the effects of a well prepared fuel ongasoline engines in regard to the combustion process, with specific illustrationsand emphasis, on a new design of fuel management system and its advantagesover presently operating systems.)</TEXT></DOC>
