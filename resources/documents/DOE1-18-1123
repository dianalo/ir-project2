Strict requirementsare imposed on such steels to provide adequate safety margins againstthe possibility of failure. The results are reported from a cooperativeprogramme involving 15 laboratories in which the properties of the steelswere clarified. The data obtained showed the markedly superior propertiesof the steels now produced, when compared with the requirements and standardsdemanded for such steels.</TEXT></DOC>
