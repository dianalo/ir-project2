Proved reserves are those thatgeological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certaintyto be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existingeconomic and operating conditions. During 1987, proved reserves of crudeoil increased by 1.4 percent or 367 million barrels. This increase wasprincipally due to the largest positive revision (3687 million barrels)ever recorded by EIA. Very large positive revisions (1121 million barrels)occurred in Alaska because of infill drilling, enhanced recovery, andreassessment of field performance. Large upward revisions were also reportedin the lower 48 states, primarily due to expansion of heavy oil thermalrecovery projects in California (505 million barrels) and enhanced recoveryprojects in West Texas (477 million barrels). These revisions were supportedby improved economic conditions as the average US crude oil price increasedfrom $12.51 per barrel for 1986 to $15.41 for 1987. Each year there arealso substantial revision decreases and other adjustments to reserves.Combined, the reserve adjustments and revisions added 2549 million barrelsto the 1987 crude oil reserve base, nearly 3 times the 1986 volume androughly twice the 1977 through 1986 annual average of 1426 million barrels.27 refs., 9 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
