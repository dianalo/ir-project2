Buoyed by firmer U.S. interest rates and bullish sentiment ahead of today's release of U.S. trade data for May, the dollar passed 1.8500 marks early in the New York afternoon. Almost immediately, traders said, the Fed began selling dollars to stop the rise. After receding to around 1.8490 marks for about two hours, the dollar surged again in late trading to draw another reported round of intervention.    Some traders said the Fed's job was made difficult because of orders left on traders' books to buy dollars at 1.8500 marks, or just below. &quot;At this point, they're just selling dollars to fill buy orders,&quot; one trader said.    A spokesman for the Fed would neither confirm nor deny reports that the central bank had intervened.    Late in the U.S. day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8508 marks, up from 1.8423 marks late Wednesday, and at 133.23 yen, up from 132.70 yen.    In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at 133.45 yen.    One New York dealer, who said the Fed sold dollars at his bank, indicated Fed traders were determined not to let the dollar rise above 1.8500 marks.    He speculated that either the Fed was fulfilling an obligation with the West German Bundesbank to intervene at 1.8500 marks, or the Fed may be acting on advance knowledge of the May trade data.    The move above 1.8500 marks on the eve of the release the trade data, when a cautious lull normally descends on trading, surprised most dealers.    Traders said increases by major U.S. banks in their prime lending rates to 9 1/2% from 9% late in the New York morning added to the already strong demand for dollars ahead of the trade report.    Most traders said the dollar rose because of the conviction that a poor trade figure would only temporarily reverse its upward trend.    According to a survey of economists by Dow Jones, a rebound in U.S. imports likely outweighed modest export gains in May, pushing the seasonally adjusted merchandise trade deficit to $11.2 billion, wider than April's $9.89 billion gap.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold settled at $438.70 an ounce, down $1.70. Estimated volume was a moderately heavy 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $438.20 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---              LATE NEW YORK TRADING             Thursday, July 14, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
