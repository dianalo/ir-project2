Ross attended the news conference as an observer and did not speak.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Korn had told Conley he probably would recommend the acting chairman, whomConley had worked for for the past two years.;    Conley, reached by telephoneMonday, denied she resigned for any other reason than being fed up with sexisttreatment by some of her male colleagues, especially her current boss.;    &quot;Imade my concerns known (to Korn) on several occasions. Perhaps he doesn't wantto hear them,&quot; said Conley, who was one of the first woman brain surgeons inthe country. &quot;I quit because my environment at the university has been non-supportive and intolerable.&quot;.;    Korn said he is sure Conley's resignation&quot;is not a 'sour- grapes' complaint&quot; over the chair appointment, and he doesnot doubt the sincerity of her charges.;    But he believes Conley used herresignation, submitted for other reasons, as a forum to &quot;heighten awareness&quot;about sexism in the medical profession.;    &quot;I was distressed and acceptedwith great regret Dr. Conley's resignation. I think she's a wonderfuleducator, investigator and clinician,&quot; Korn said. &quot;But the issues that havecome up have come as a surprise to me. They had never come up before nor werethey mentioned in her resignation.&quot;;    &quot;Medicine is very much amale-dominated profession historically and there is no question that itcontains inappropriate behavior which needs to be cleaned up,&quot; Korn said. &quot;Ithink we have a lot of work to do to take stereotypical behaviors out of theprofession.&quot;;    Conley has claimed that over the years she and many of herfemale colleagues have been subject to sexism ranging from being called&quot;honey&quot; by their male colleagues to having their breasts fondled in public.;   &quot;I've actually had (a male doctor) running (a) hand up my leg at a luncheon,&quot;Conley said Monday. &quot;It's always in public -- always done for a reaction.&quot;;   Conley also said she had made it clear to Korn that she felt the acting headof the department, Dr. Gerald Silverberg, &quot;constantly treated me as aninferior because I am female&quot; and she could not continue to work for him.;   Silverberg could not be reached for comment Monday.;    &quot;I have been miserablefor the past two years, but this is much more than a problem betweenSilverberg and me,&quot; Conley said. &quot;I have endured sexist comments and behaviorfor years, but I could escape because the former head of the department wasvery supportive.&quot;;    Conley claims that she knows other women who have leftthe medical school due to &quot;true sexual harassment at the hands of members ofmy department.&quot; She agreed to name the women to Korn at his request.;    Shesaid that a student seminar held recently on sexism in the medical professionpropelled her to take a stand.;    About 15 percent of the medical schoolfaculty members are women and Korn has appointed two department chairwomen,the first ever at Stanford.;    Korn said that in the seven years he has beenat Stanford two complaints of sexual harassment have been filed. One is stillpending. The university has a 10-year-old policy prohibiting sexualharassment.;    Dr. Charlotte Jacobs, a senior associate dean who has been atthe medical school for 15 years, has been leading an effort to further examinethe problem of sexism at the medical school and develop recommendations.;   Jacobs, who last fall asked Conley to head a faculty senate subcommittee onthe issue, said she (Jacobs) has not felt sexually discriminated against atthe medical school. However, she acknowledged that some students havecomplained to her about the problem.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SUE HUTCHISON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910604  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  762  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, June 4, 199100156166,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
