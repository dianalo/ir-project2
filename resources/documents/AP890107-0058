Gen. Renato de Villa, military chief of staff, said the camp _captured Thursday by eight Moslem policemen and seven supporters whotook two high-ranking officers hostage _ was secured late thisafternoon.   De Villa said eight soldiers and two civilians were wounded.   He said 16 bodies, many burned beyond recognition, were found inthe headquarters building and the camp mosque. One of the rebelsupporters was killed and his wife was wounded in Thursday'stakeover.   The military attacked the Moslems on Friday after the captives _Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla and Col. Romeo Abendan _ were reportedkilled. After that attack was repulsed, the military tried againtoday.   The military confirmed that Batalla was killed during thestandoff and said one of the 16 bodies recovered was tentativelyidentified as Abendan.   The policemen had been ordered to surrender to Batalla, theregional Philippine Constabulary commander, to face murder chargesin a 1984 incident.   The military said up to 60 other Moslems, including manysoldiers, had joined the rebel group after ransacking the garrisonarmory.   In Manila, President Corazon Aquino said she was ``grieved'' bythe loss of lives but added: ``Let there be no doubt about ourequally strong resolve to protect our people from such brutal andsenseless acts of violence.''   At midmorning, two military UH-1 helicopters strafed the mainstronghold with machine gun fire and a Sikorsky helicopter firedfour rockets, setting the building on fire.   Government troops surrounding the compound cheered as thehelicopters opened fire. The compound is in Zamboanga, 560 milessouth of Manila.   The leader of the gunmen, patrolman Rizah Alih, was charged butacquitted in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor Cesar Climaco. Threeweeks after Climaco's death, seven people were killed in a marineraid on Alih's home.   Alih faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, Batallareceived permission to arrest Alih. Batalla ordered Alih and eightothers detained. All of them could be charged with murder orconspiracy to commit murder.   In an apparently unrelated incident, military sources said sevenmarines were killed and two wounded today during an attack by Moslemrebels on Basilan island, about 10 miles to the south.   A military report said two rebels were also slain.   About 5 million Moslems live in the Philippines, which haspopulation of 59 million.</TEXT></DOC>
