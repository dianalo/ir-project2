Adams as the House GovernmentOperations housing and employment subcommittee began hearings Fridayon the program.   The program, known as ``coinsurance'' because the governmentassumed part of the liability on loans with lenders, showed signs ofproblems two years after it was instituted in 1983 as a hallmark ofReagan administration efforts to turn the functions of manygovernment programs over to private business.   A November 1985 internal audit of eight projects showed``inappropriate lender underwriting practices caused inflatedmortgages,'' Adams said.   The subcommittee has been examining possible abuse,influence-peddling and mismanagement in HUD programs during theReagan administration.   HUD officials promised to ``improve lender monitoring processesand enforcement actions,'' although they rejected Adams' assessmentof the problems and said controls he suggested were so strict theywould discourage participation, he said.   Lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a project'soperating income as an incentive to repair, rehabilitate or buildlow- and moderate-income multi-family housing.   If a borrower defaults, lenders are responsible for about 20percent of the loss while HUD picks up the tab for the remaining 80percent.   HUD now faces more than $100 million in claims against bad loansmade in the program, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., subcommitteechairman.   In the most recent audit in March 1989, Adams found the BentonMortgage Company of Knoxville, Tenn., had misrepresented mortgageamounts and rents on 14 projects it had underwritten, creating anestimated $22 million in excessive mortgages, said Adams.   He said the government would pay excessive subsidies of $37million over the 15-year period of contracts for rental housingBenton had coinsured.   Benton is one of three companies which has been placed on sixmonths' probation from the program. Three companies have beensuspended and three others are under review by HUD, Adams said.   Adams revealed Friday that Benton is the subject of a grand juryinvestigation, which he said he would not discuss.   Adams said his first report of problems in the coinsuranceprogram was sent to then-Assistant Secretary of Housing Phil Abrams,one of several former HUD employees who was paid as a consultant onprojects funded under the moderate rehabilitation program.   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., observed that ``Abrams used Bentonin all of his deals,'' in that program.   Meanwhile, congressional pressure is mounting for a completereview of the housing department.   One staffer said Senate Banking, Housing and Urban AffairsCommittee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., has sent a letter topanel members seeking authorization for an investigation.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Banking, Housingand Urban Affairs subcommittee on housing, said Friday he would votefor a probe of the ``scandal-ridden'' department.   And House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,said HUD Secretary Jack Kemp would testify before his panel July 12to discuss reform measures being developed in the agency.</TEXT></DOC>
