L. 98-370),which required the formation of a working group of industry representativesand key federal agency officials to explore ways for promoting the U.S.renewable energy industry over-seas. DOE is a member of CORECT, along with7 other federal agencies. CORECT undertakes activities in support of theU.S. renewable energy industry's export efforts. In order to carry outthese activities, CORECT needs a close liaison with the U.S. renewableenergy industry. The U.S. Export Council on Renewable Energy is the onlyknown organization that represents the export interests of the U.S. renewableenergy trade associations. Therefore, the grant renewal application isbeing accepted by DOE because it knows of no other renewable energy tradeassociation which is conducting or planning to conduct these types of exportassistance activities.The project period for the grant renewal is a one year period, expectedto begin in May 1989. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $132,015for this project period.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Chicago, Illinois on May 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy S.
