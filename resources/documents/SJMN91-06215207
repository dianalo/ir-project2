Those fighting theUniversity of California's decision to transform the park into a recreationalarea are vowing to slug it out as long as necessary. Construction on the$500,000 courts will continue throughout the week, and demonstrators alreadyare making plans for a &quot;Take Back the Park&quot; rally at 11 a.m. Saturday.;    &quot;Ifpast history is any indication, people will not be satisfied until thevolleyball courts are gone,&quot; said Stephen Dunifer, a member of the People'sPark Defense Union.;    The violence that broke out about 8 p.m. Wednesday waseerily reminiscent of some of the battles of the late 1960s. Once again,UC-Berkeley was trying to assert its ownership of the 2.8-acre parcel, andonce again people were willing to go to extreme lengths to keep it a &quot;freespace.&quot;;    Fifty-seven people were arrested throughout the day, although onlyseven had been formally charged with trespassing by late Thursday afternoon.Some were park supporters; others may have come deliberately to loot storesand wreak havoc, police said. Two police officers were injured in the melee.;   But this People's Park battle also differed significantly from the one in1969, when one protester was killed and another blinded. Then, many communitymembers stood firmly behind the defenders of People's Park. They objected tothe university's plans to pave it for a parking lot or erect studentdormitories.;    Today, many Berkeley residents are tired of the park'sscruffy nature. It's not the homeless they oppose, but the drug dealers whobelieve the park is open territory. They hope volleyball courts will attract abroader mix of people.;    &quot;We feel being for marijuana in the 1960s was onething,&quot; said Paul Rabinow, who lives in Berkeley and teaches anthropology atthe university. &quot;Being for crack cocaine in the 1990s doesn't represent clearthinking. (People's Park) is a preserve where a large percentage of thecitizens of Berkeley do not feel comfortable.&quot;;    Park supporters agree thepark could be spruced up so more people feel comfortable there. They saythey're opposed not to change but to the arrogance of the university, which isimposing a solution without consulting with the park's &quot;residents.&quot;;    &quot;Wewould be the first to admit there are problems, but they have to be solved bythe community,&quot; Dunifer said. &quot;The university comes in and tries to drive awedge in the community by playing on people's fears and prejudices.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FRANCES DINKELSPIEL, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Berkeley  </CITY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  615  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215207,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
