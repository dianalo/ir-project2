SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration is seeking changes inU.S. law to allow up to 150,000 Soviets to immigrate to thiscountry over the next five years after a flood of visa applicationscaught the government off guard.   The adminstration has been the target of criticism from CapitolHill for its tangled approach to the flood of applications, comingprimarily from Soviet Jews. More than 4,000 Jews were allowed toleave the Soviet Union last month, the highest total in 10 years.   For years, the administration has demanded that the Sovietsloosen their stranglehold on emigrant applications, but once theflood began under Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the exodusappeared to overwhelm U.S. officials.   In order to remedy the situation, the State Department announcedon Wednesday that the agency had sent legislation to Congress toallow 30,000 immigrant visas per year over a period of five yearsfor those people ``whose admission would be in our foreign policyinterest,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher.   While the spokesman said the primary beneficiaries of the newlegislation ``are likely to be Soviet citizens,'' the law could beused for other nationalities.   ``We're trying to make sure we take care of everybody from theSoviet Union who wants to come in,'' Boucher said.   But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the HouseJudiciary subcommittee on immigration, refugees and internationallaw, said the administration proposal doesn't deal adequately withthe problem of Soviet Jewish refugees.   ``It creates an unprecedented `pick and choose' immigrationpolicy,'' Morrison said in a telephone interview. ``It allows thepresident to choose people from different areas who are notimmigrants or refugees.''   After his subcommittee holds a hearing today on Soviet refugees,Morrison said, he plans to introduce legislation that would dealwith the Soviet Jewish refugee situation ``narrowly, expeditiouslyand with adequate resources for resettlement.''   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson says that in order to help clear upthe backlog of Soviet visa applicants in Moscow and Rome, he issending additional inspectors to both cities to help speed up theprocessing.   More than 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at theU.S. Embassy in Moscow for permission to enter the United States asrefugees, and another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters nearRome.   The current rate of Soviet applications has been running about4,000 a month. At that rate, the allocated refugee slots were dueto run out shortly.   Those being denied access under the refugee quotas were offeredparolee status, but that did not give them government funding, nordid it allow the applicants to apply eventually for citizenship.   Last summer, the backup problem was exacerbated by a change inthe Justice Department policy that ordered INS to determine refugeestatus for Soviets case-by-case rather than as a group. That istrue for other refugee applicants.   As a stop-gap measure, the State Department in January shifted7,000 unused slots meant for Vietnamese refugees to accommodate theSoviet overflow.   Although some estimates project about 40,000 Soviet applicantsthis year, the administration had budgeted for only half thatnumber.   In a statement, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said thelegislation was not specific to nationality in order to provide thepresident with some ``flexibility'' in case he wanted to apply itto another nation at some other point.   He pointed out that the law could apply to Vietnamese people whoobtained exit visas from their homeland but do not qualify forrefugee status under current immigration law.   All immigrants have to prove that they would not become a wardof the state by showing that they had a job offer or some othermeans of financial support, Boucher said.   The new legislation does not contain any request for funding forthe additional immigrants, although the White House has requested$100 million from Congress in supplemental funding for migrationand refugee assistance.   Boucher said the administration also hoped that voluntaryagencies would be able to help make up the shortfall.   As well, he added, ``We're hopeful that friends and relatives inthe United States would be able to provide such assistance.''</TEXT></DOC>
