SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp. are developing a program that, for the first time, will formally take worker participation at the company beyond the plant floor to the corporate level.    The new &quot;quality network&quot; could be the basis for even larger union involvement negotiated in a new national contract, which the two sides will begin discussing next month. But such involvement may be difficult to implement, considering that the UAW and the Big Three auto makers are still struggling to get some managers and union members to accept union participation in factory-level decisions. And the union's relations are strained with GM in particular, because of plant closings and the absence of profit-sharing payments to workers this year.    Under the new GM program, at least a half-dozen UAW members will work full time with GM executives at the company's major car, truck and parts divisions. They will discuss a variety of issues, such as design and engineering, affecting the quality of those products.    It isn't clear yet just how much influence the union will be allowed in decisions on those topics. Union and company officials discussed the program in only the broadest terms in interviews last week, pending an official announcement to be made sometime during the next several weeks.    In recent years the UAW has pushed for access to financial and performance information as well as for involvement in important decisions within many GM factories. While some union officials feel they have made progress with those programs, they say that power in the plants is limited without participation in decision making at a higher level. And the union says it needs greater power in the corporation at a time of dwindling economic gains and disappearing jobs.    But the UAW hasn't been united in its push for a role in corporate decision making. Some members argue that the corporation will never give the union a truly meaningful role, and that attempts at close cooperation only undermine the union's traditional role of protecting workers in an adversarial relationship.    In recent years, the UAW has gotten small slices of corporate decision-making in Detroit. It currently participates in a variety of product decisions at Saturn, the new GM subsidiary that is supposed to explore new ways of making cars and slated to begin production in 1990. And union President Owen Bieber sits on the Chrysler Corp. board.    Other U.S. unions also have moved along that path. The United Steelworkers union has a board seat at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., as well as the right to approve the company's attempts to renegotiate raw-material agreements. The Steelworkers union and most of the major major steel companies also have begun a coordinated &quot;Labor-Management Participation Team&quot; effort, though most of that program is geared toward participation in decisions made at the factory level, instead of at the corporate level.    &quot;This is a big item,&quot; said Lloyd E. Reuss, GM's executive vice president for North American car and truck operations, speaking of the new joint program with the UAW. &quot;This is an attempt to put together a whole quality network. It isn't one of these things where you're just making an announcement. We've been working on it for over two years.&quot;    Mr. Reuss declined, however, to provide any more details about the program.    The UAW has wanted a greater role in corporate quality decisions because &quot;very few problems are caused in the final assembly,&quot; said Donald F. Ephlin, the UAW's vice president in charge of its GM department. &quot;If they've got a problem it's usually somewhere else, and to that degree you go beyond the plants. You've got to go back to the source, be it the (parts) vendor or another GM plant or the design.&quot;    Under the new quality program, the union representatives &quot;aren't making decisions about whether a product should run or not run,&quot; he said. But &quot;once this policy is enunciated within the corporation, it gives us the ability to raise hell . . . if management at any level reverts to quantity ahead of quality.&quot;    While focusing on the quality issue, Mr. Ephlin said he hoped the union's role would spread. &quot;It's a pretty good model for other things&quot; within the corporation, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
