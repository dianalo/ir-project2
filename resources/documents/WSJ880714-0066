The change is part of a request by Ohio Power, one of American Electric Power Co.'s eight operating units, to transfer pollution-reduction credits from one of its coal-burning electric plants to another. It marks the first time that a utility has sought credit for lessening the total tons of sulfur dioxide -- considered by some scientists to be a leading cause of acid raincoming out of its smokestacks.    Until now, more than 100 utilities have received credit at one plant for cutting back on the amount of sulfur dioxide they're discharging at another. Those credits, however, have been based on the pounds of pollutants emitted per unit of heat created by the burning of coal, rather than on the total tonnage of pollutants emitted each year from a facility. Weather, terrain and other factors play a part in the per-unit calculations, and environmentalists argue that they give a false impression of how much pollution actually has been curbed.    To some extent, the industry seems to agree. &quot;The guy on the street relates to total tons,&quot; said Robert Beck, an assistant director of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group in Washington.    The bid by Ohio Power comes as the company attempts to meet new smokestack-height regulations, announced in January by the Environmental Protection Agency. The new rules permit use of the tonnage method of measurement. But the company's emissions balancing act has broader implications as well.    The change in the measurement method would become significant, for instance, if the Clean Air Act is strengthened. That's because, based on various bills that are pending, power plants would be forced to abate sulfur dioxide emissions on a straight, total-tons basis.    &quot;What Ohio Power is doing,&quot; explained Rob Brenner, the EPA's air policy director, &quot;is applicable for other companies, depending on what happens&quot; in Congress. Yesterday, a group of senators led by George Mitchell, the Maine Democrat, announced they are prepared to force a clean air measure to the Senate floor before adjournment later this year.    Said a company spokesman: &quot;At this point, all we want to do is comply with the stack-height rules. But this could indeed become an important compliance strategy for acid rain control.&quot;    As to the specifics of the credit-transfer request, Ohio Power must meet a regulatory limit of an average annual discharge of 57,000 tons of sulfur dioxide at its Kammer facility in Moundsville, W.Va. The company said it would cut average annual sulfur dioxide emissions to 102,000 tons from 150,000 by switching the plant to a lower-sulfur coal, and make up the difference by applying a credit of 45,000 tons from its nearby Mitchell plant, also in Moundsville.    Kammer, located at the mouth of a coal mine, provides all the electricity for an Ormet Corp. aluminum smelter, the third largest in the country. The smelter takes alumina -- a powdery substance extracted from bauxite -- and turns it into metal ingot. Ormet, in turn, gives much of its metal to an adjacent Consolidated Aluminum Corp. mill.    If the proposal is denied, Ohio Power said, the Ormet plant would be devastated because it would be forced to raise electric rates. Ohio Power said 2,200 jobs are &quot;hanging in the balance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
