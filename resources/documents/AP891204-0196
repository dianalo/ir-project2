Everyone knows that communism is not confined geographically toEurope and the Soviet Union.   A billion Chinese and millions of Vietnamese, Laotians,Ethiopians, Romanians, Afghans and Cubans still live undercommunist regimes that have remained Stalinist or become born-againStalinists.   The Cambodian conflict is not between communism and democracybut rather between two types of communism. At the end of 1989,there were still 50,000 Cuban soldiers in Angola protecting anon-elected communist power.   Mozambique's economy has been destroyed in a disastrousexperiment with Marxism and by the civil war that followed. Manyquasi-Marxist regimes _ in Madagascar, Algeria, Benin and Nicaragua_ continue to starve their populations and start wars, at home orwith their neighbors or both.   I firmly believe that communism is dying. But communism is farfrom having disappeared.   There is no doubt communism is fading rapidly in Eastern Europewhere it has never been accepted and where it has always been seenas an imported system, imposed and maintained artificially by aforeign power.   When the threat of military repression became highly unlikely,thanks to the policies of Mikhail Gorbachev, the desire fordemocracy could explode freely. So can we say the Cold War is over,as the current phrase has it? Not quite.   For what is the Cold War? It was the direct result of Stalin'sannexation of Eastern Europe, freed from the Nazis by the Red Armyand immediately re-occupied by that same Red Army.   What does Gorbachev say? That these countries can becomepolitical democracies with market economies provided they remain inthe same geostrategic and diplomatic framework as the Cold War. Inother words, if they regain their internal freedom, these countriesremain satellites as far as foreign policy is concerned, for thetime being anyway.   This is the position Gorbachev has been pushing hard and it hasbeen accepted by the West. Generally known as ``Finlandization,''it is much more than that for the Warsaw Pact countries.   Finland is not directly included in Soviet military calculationsand does not have Soviet troops stationed in its territory. One canforesee that the Warsaw Pact agreements _ never freely negotiatedby the peoples concerned _ will have to be re-examined by theirfuture democratic governments, eager to become sovereign statesonce again.   As for the Soviet Union, the major new element is the failure ofperestroika. No one in the West seems to have clearly grasped this,but every Soviet citizen now takes it for granted _ even economistsin Gorbachev's entourage.   For nearly five years, the Soviet leader has tried to get theSoviet economy back on its feet by using a ``market socialism''formula which injects a little pragmatism and profit motive in anoverall structure that remains intact.   Result: In 1985, the situation was bad; today it iscatastrophic. Communism can be discarded; it cannot be repaired.That is, if you begin to really repair it, you quickly realize thatthe only way out is dropping it altogether. That's what hashappened in Hungary and Poland. That's what China refused to do,resorting to mass terror.   The Soviet Union has not made a clear choice between capitalismwith private property or the return to Stalinist collectivism.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
