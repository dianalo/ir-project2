Program Purpose</ITAG>Head Start is a national program providing comprehensive developmentalservices primarily to low-income preschool children, age three to the ageof compulsory school attendance, and their families. To help enrolled childrento achieve their full potential, Head Start programs provide comprehensivehealth, nutritional, educational, social and other services. In addition,Head Start programs are required to provide for the direct participationof parents of enrolled children in the development, conduct, and directionof local programs. In fiscal year (FY) 1986, Head Start served 451,732children through a network of more than 1,305 grantees and more than 670delegate agencies which have an approved written agreement with the granteesto operate Head Start programs.While Head Start is targeted primarily on children whose families haveincomes at or below the proverty line or are eligible for public assistance,the Administration for Children, Youth and Families' policy permits upto 10 percent of the Head Start children in local programs to be from familieswho do not meet these low-income criteria. Head Start also requires thata minimum of 10 percent of enrollment opportunities in each State be madeavailable to handicapped children. Such children are expected to be enrolledin the full range of Head Start services and activities in a mainstreamsetting with their non-handicapped peers, and to receive needed specialeducation and related services.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rulemaking History</ITAG>Historically, Head Start has been concerned with preventing child abuseand neglect. On January 26, 1977, ACYF published a policy instruction forHead Start programs entitled ``Indentification and Reporting of Child Abuseand Neglect.'' A brochure entitled ``Child Sexual Abuse Prevention_Tipsto Parents'' was developed in 1984. It was mailed in 1985 to all Head Startprograms, and also received wide public distribution. In addition, theexisting structure of Head Start programs helps prevent child abuse andneglect in Head Start centers through emphasizing parental involvementwith parental visits to the Head Start center, parent education, carefulsupervision of staff and continuing staff training, as well as throughthe use of the social services component to assist Head Start familiesin locating resources and providing other family support.Finally, on April 3, 1985, the Department published a Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) that proposed changes in Head Start personnel policies(50 FR 13253) in order to emphasize the importance of careful screeningof prospective employees in Head Start programs. The following additionsto the regulations at 45 CFR 1301.31 were proposed:1. Head Start personnel policies on recruitment and selection of staffmust require a declaration from all prospective employees listing:_All pending and prior criminal arrests and charges related to child abuse,neglect and/or child sexual abuse and their disposition; and_All felony convictions and current criminal charges.The declaration may exclude:_Traffic fines of $50.00 or less;_Any offense, other than an offense related to child abuse and/or childsexual abuse, or a violent felony committed before the prospective employee's18th birthday which was finally adjudicated in a juvenile court or undera youth offender law;_Any conviction the record of which has been expunged under Federal orState law; and_Any conviction set aside under the Federal Youth and Corrections Act orsimilar State authority.2. The policies governing recruitment and selection of staff must providethat before an employee is hired on a permanent basis, the grantee or delegateagency will have conducted:_An interview of the applicant;_A check of personal and employment references to be provided by the applicant,including verification of the accuracy of the information provided by theapplicant; and_A check to determine if the applicant has a criminal record at the Stateor national level of crimes related to child abuse and neglect, to theextent permitted by State law.3. The policies must require that the grantee or delegate agency will:_Explicitly advise every employee and volunteer that sexual activity withchildren is illegal; and_Develop a plan for responding to suspected or reported child abuse orsexual abuse of Head Start children whether it occurs inside or outsidethe program.Interested persons and organizations were invited to submit comments onor before June 3, 1985. The Department received 80 letters from individuals,advocacy organizations, national and local service organizations, and Stateagencies, including 58 Head Start agencies.Below is a summary of the comments received and a discussion of the changesmade in the final rule in response to these comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of the Final Rule</ITAG>In general, commenters supported the purpose of the NPRM although manystated that new regulations were unnecessary because there had not beenany known cases of child abuse and neglect associated with Head Start programs.Many Head Start agencies also reported that procedures for background andemployment history checks had long been a part of their standard procedures.A number of commenters, however, misunderstood the NPRM to require nationaland State criminal record checks for all Head Start programs in all States.This was not our intent and we have discussed it below. A number of othercommenters objected to national criminal record checks based on the findingsin a report by the Office of the Inspector General that such record checkshave limited effectiveness.In summary, we made the following changes in the final rule:_The language regarding criminal record checks is clarified to requiresuch checks only if required by State law or administrative requirement._The requirement in the NPRM for Head Start programs to advise every employeeand volunteer that sexual abuse of children is illegal has been dropped._The requirements for declaration of arrests have been limited to declarationsof arrests for child sexual abuse._Proposed requirements for declaration of all felony convictions and currentcriminal charges have been changed to require declaration of all convictionsof violent felonies._We have added a requirement that violent felonies committed before age18 also must be declared._A requirement for a probationary period for all new employees has beenadded.Below is a section by section discussion of the comments and charges made.Section 1301.31 (a) and (b)Although we proposed no changes to paragraphs (a) and (b) and we receivedno comments on these paragraphs, we are taking this opportunity to addthe words ``and implement'' to the first sentence of paragraph (a). Thesentence will now read, ``Head Start agencies must establish and implementpersonnel policies for themselves and their delegate agencies.'' This additionis made to remove any ambiguity that may exist about the intent of thissection.Section 1301.31(c)The NPRM proposed in andSection; 1301.31(c)(1) that the personnel policiesrequire prospective employees to sign a declaration listing:(1) All pending and prior criminal arrests and charges and their dispositionrelated to child abuse, neglect and/or child sexual abuse; and(2) All felony convictions and current criminal charges.Many of the commenters opposed the proposal to require a declaration ofcurrent criminal charges (as opposed to convictions) stating their beliefthat arrests are often arbitrary and unfounded, and such a declarationis unfair. We agree in part and, therefore, the declaration of currentcriminal charges has been dropped except for criminal charges related tochild sexual abuse. These have been retained because convictions relatedto child sexual abuse may be difficult to obtain. We also have retainedrequirements for declaration of all convictions related to other formsof child abuse and neglect and all convictions of violent felonies.One commenter suggested that we also require information on pending andprior criminal arrests, charges and their disposition related to spouseabuse and other domestic violence. We do not believe it is necessary toexpand the declaration to include such additional information that maynot be directly related to employment in the Head Start program.A recommendation was made by one commenter that we also ask for a declarationof civil offenses. As our intent was to prevent child abuse we do not believeit is necessary to include this requirement in the rule. Grantees havethe discretion to seek additional appropriate information from prospectiveemployees as they see fit.The NPRM did not address the matter of whether current employees or volunteersbe required to sign the declaration. However, some commenters proposedthat current staff and volunteers be included in this requirement and otherssuggested they be excluded. The OHDS will allow each grantee to determinewhether current staff and volunteers must sign the declaration requiredof new employees by this rule.The purpose of the employee declaration form is to help provide programswith important information about prospective employees so programs canavoid hiring people that they believe should not be caring for children.Programs must make their own specific determinations of how to use theinformation obtained. Information about arrests, charges and convictionsper se do not necessarily prohibit the hiring of a person by a Head Startprogram. Such information must be evaluated to consider the nature andgravity of the offense(s), the time that has passed since the convictionand/or completion of the sentence, as well as the nature of the job heldor sought. Section 1301.31(d) Section 1301.31(c)(2) of the NPRM defined specifically what may be excludedfrom the employee declaration. However, in paragraph (d)(2) an exceptionrequires the prospective employee to declare any offense related to childabuse and/or child sexual abuse, committed before the prospective employee's18th birthday, which was finally adjudicated in a juvenile court or undera youth offender law. One commenter recommended that prospective employeesalso be required to declare violent felonies committed before age 18. Theybelieve such information is as important as information about child abuseoffenses. We agree that such information is needed in order to evaluatea prospective employee and have revised the regulation accordingly. Another commenter mentioned that when juvenile records are sealed priorto the 18th birthday, the offense would not be known and that exclusion,therefore, would be unnecessary. Retaining the exclusion serves to makethis clear to prospective employees. Section 1301.31(e) The NPRM proposed in andSection;1301.31(d) that grantees must have policiesthat require an interview of the applicant and a check of his/her personaland employment references prior to hiring new staff on a permanent basis.The commenters were unanimous in their support for this requirement. Interviewsand reference checks appear to be standard procedures according to commentsreceived from many Head Start grantees. Because of the addition of paragraph(f) regarding a required probationary period, discussed below, the referencein paragraph (e) has been changed from ``employees hired on a permanentbasis'' to employees ``hired for a probationary period.'' Section 1301.31(f) We have added paragraph (f) which requires that all new employees servea probationary period. This probationary period for new employees allowstime for Head Start administrators and staff to monitor employee performanceand evaluate the information obtained as a result of the criminal recordchecks. Many Head Start and other day care programs already utilize probationaryperiods and many experts in the child care and child abuse prevention fieldconsider a probationary period for new employees to be an important stepin insuring the safety of children. Section 1301.31(g) The NPRM proposed, in andSection;1301.31(d)(3), that grantees or delegateagencies must, to the extent permitted by State law, conduct a criminalrecord check at the State or national level of crimes related to childabuse and neglect. A small number of respondents supported the requirementsfor State and national record checks, particularly from States that alreadyhave mandatory laws requiring such criminal record checks. Most commenters,however, misunderstood the language of the NPRM to require State and nationalcriminal record checks for all prospective employees of Head Start. Theyobjected wrongly to such national criminal record checks because of thecost of the record checks, the increased paperwork, alternative and betteruses of program funds, perceived potential infringement on civil rights,and the findings of the Department's Office of the Inspector General ina report dated January 1985 on ``Preventing Sexual Abuse in Day Care Programs''.That report stated that national criminal record checks through the FederalBureau of Investigation (FBI) have limited effectiveness because childsexual abuse frequently is unreported and the conviction rate for childsexual abuse crimes is low, with only one to fifteen percent of sexualabusers having criminal records. The Department has clarified the language in paragraph (g) to require Stateand national criminal record checks if required by State law or administrativerequirement. This means that grantees and delegate agencies must conductonly those criminal record checks required in their States. If State lawor administrative requirement requires no such checks, then criminal recordchecks need not be initiated. If State law or administrative requirementrequires only State level checks then the criminal check is mandatory atonly the State level. If State law also requires national criminal recordchecks, the program also must make this check. Typically, the State licensingagency is responsible for working with the State law enforcement agencyto access criminal records at the State and national level through theFBI. Payment of the cost of criminal record checks may be from Federal grantfunds or from non-Federal sources. In some States, the agency mandatedto license Head Start programs conducts the criminal record check at nocharge. In other States, the individual applying for employment may beasked to be responsible for the cost of these criminal record checks.One commenter suggested that Indian Head Start grantees should be exemptfrom the requirement for State and national criminal record checks in certaincircumstances, such as for an applicant who was born or raised on an IndianReservation and is well known. Similarly, a commenter also advocated exemptingapplicants in rural areas if the applicants are long-time residents andare well known in the community. Our response is that this is a matterfor State law or regulation.A few commenters felt that the crimes to be considered during record checksshould only include recent and relevant crimes and should be accompaniedwith information about rehabilitation. We believe programs should haveaccess to all the information covered by the rule.There were also recommendations that the State child care licensing agencyscreen and control information and act as the liaison with the State lawenforcement agency and thus the FBI for the national criminal record checks.In some States, this is already the case. However, we believe the Stateshould have discretion in making this determination.One commenter suggested that the Department consider establishing an interagencyagreement between headquarters ACYF and the FBI and between regional officesand various State investigative agencies. These agreements would facilitatethe national and State criminal checks and waive any costs involved. Itwas also suggested that a national clearinghouse with a toll-free numberbe established to assist local programs.In addition, there were several recommendations that information derivedfrom criminal and employer and personal checks should be kept confidentialand should be known only to the official having the authority to hire;and that such information should be made known to the applicant so thathe or she may have notice and an opportunity to respond. Commenters providedcopies of State laws to illustrate their points. The Department believesthat grantees should develop systematic approaches to implementing recordchecks that will not infringe on individual civil rights, while establishinga system to protect children.A number of comments indicated that agencies should not adopt an arbitrarypolicy of refusal to hire solely on the basis of an arrest, a pending criminalcharge or a conviction, but that an agency should review the circumstancesof each case in order to assess the relevancy of the charge or convictionto the hiring decision. In response to these comments, a statement to thiseffect has been added at paragraph (g)(2). The hiring decision itself shouldbe based on the qualifications and capability of the applicant to carefor and work with children in accordance with the Head Start PerformanceStandards and each grantee's job requirements.Section 1301.31(h)The NPRM proposed in andSection; 1301.31(e)(1) to require grantees or delegateagencies to advise all employees and volunteers that sexual activity withchildren is illegal. This proposed requirement was taken from the Officeof the Inspector General (OIG) report mentioned earlier and was intendedas an additional safeguard for Head Start staff and volunteers which couldbe easily implemented.However, a number of commenters disagreed with the proposed requirement.This requirement was described as an ``administrative nuisance,'' and ``absurd.''One commenter stated that ``no person intelligent enough to meet otherjob requirements is so uninformed as to fail to realize that sexual abuseor exploitation of children is illegal.'' In addition, concern surfacedthat informing employees, prospective employees and volunteers that oneparticular activity is illegal without listing other activities that areillegal, may be confusing and appear to imply that other illegal activitiesnot listed are acceptable.We agree and, therefore, have deleted this proposal.The NPRM also proposed, in andSection; 1301.31(e)(2) to require that a planmust be developed for responding to suspected or known child abuse in theprogram or outside the program. This was not a new requirement but wasadded to the NPRM in order to underscore its importance, as an integralpart of Head Start's concern for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.A number of commenters suggested that more explicit information be providedon what constitutes a ``plan to report abuse.'' A plan to report abuseis now required and has previously been outlined in the Policy Instruction,``Identification and Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect,'' publishedin the January 26, 1977<T4> Federal Register</T4> (42 FR 4970-4971), and provided to all HeadStart programs. This policy is now published as an appendix to andSection;1301.31, Personnel policies.This policy, specifically ``Section B.1., Staff responsibility,'' providesinformation necessary to establish an effective plan for responding toknown or suspected child abuse of Head Start children. Additional copiesof both these documents may be ordered by writing to ACYF, P.O. Box 1182,Washington, DC 20013. The agency responsible for coordinating child abusein the State also can be helpful in developing such a plan.Several requests were received for a definition of child abuse and neglectand child sexual abuse. Grantees and State agencies should refer to theirown State laws for a definition of child abuse and neglect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules, defined in the Order as any rule that has an annual effecton the national economy of $100 million or more, or certain other specifiedeffects. Nothing in the rule is likely to create substantial costs. TheSecretary concludes that this regulation is not a major rule within themeaning of the Executive Order because it does not have an effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more or otherwise meet the threshold criteria.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980</ITAG>Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6),we try to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities,'' we prepare an analysis describingthe rule's impact on small entities. Small entities are defined in theAct to include small businesses, small non-profit organizations, and smallgovernmental entities. While this regulation would affect small entities(Head Start grantees and delegate agencies), it is not substantial andin many instances the small entities already may meet some of the requirements.For these reasons, the Secretary certifies that this rule will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview and approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirement inherentin a proposed or final rule. The Department submitted andSection; 1301.31 of the NPRM to OMB for theirreview and approval, as it contains information collection requirements.OMB approved the proposed information collection and assigned a controlnumber (0980-0173), which is effective until October 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1301</ITAG>Head Start administrative practices and procedures, Education of disadvantaged,Grant programs/social programs, Child abuse and neglect.For the reasons set forth in the Preamble, 45 CFR Part 1301, Subpart D,is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">Part 1301_Head Start Grants Administration </ITAG>1.

The policy was originally promulgatedin the January 26, 1977 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (42 FR 4970-4971), ``Identification and Reportingof Child Abuse and Neglect,'' and is published as an appendix to this section.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number0980-0173.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A to andSection; 1301.31_Identification and Reporting of ChildAbuse and Neglect</ITAG>The Chapter N-30-356-1 in the Head Start Policy Manual reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">N-30-356-1-00 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">20 Applicable law and policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">30 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>80 Stat. 2304 (42 U.S.C. 2928h).</ITAG>N-30-356-1-00 <T3>Purpose. </T3>This chapter sets forth the policy governing the prevention,identification, treatment, and reporting of child abuse and neglect inHead Start.N-30-356-1-10 <T3>Scope. </T3>This policy applies to all Head Start and delegate agenciesthat operate or propose to operate a Full-Year or Summer Head Start program,or experimental or demonstration programs funded by Head Start. This issuanceconstitutes Head Start policy and noncompliance with this policy will resultin appropriate action by the responsible HEW official.N-30-356-1-20 <T3>Applicable law and policy. </T3>Section 511 of the Headstart-FollowThrough Act, P.L. 93-644, requires Head Start agencies to provide comprehensivehealth, nutritional educational, social and other services to the childrento attain their full potential. The prevention, identification, treatment,and reporting of child abuse and neglect is a part of the social servicesin Head Start. In order for a State to be eligible for grants under theChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (hereinafter called ``the Act''),P.L. 93-247, the State must have a child abuse and neglect reporting lawwhich defines ``child abuse and neglect'' substantially as that term isdefined in the regulations implementing the Act, 45 CFR 1340.1-2(b). Thatdefinition is as follows:A. ``(b) `Child abuse and neglect' means harm or threatened harm to a child'shealth or welfare by a person responsible for the child's health or welfare.``1. `Harm or threatened harm to a child's health or welfare' can occurthrough: Nonaccidental physical or mental injury; sexual abuse, as definedby State law; or neglectful treatment or maltreatment, including the failureto provide adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Provided, however, thata parent or guardian legitimately practicing his religious beliefs whothereby does not provide specified medical treatment for a child, for thatreason alone shall not be considered a negligent parent or guardian; however,such an exception shall not preclude a court from ordering that medicalservices to be provided to the child, where his health requires it.``2. `Child' means a person under the age of eighteen.``3. `A person responsible for a child's health or welfare' includes thechild's parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's healthor welfare, whether in the same home as the child, a relative's home, afoster care home, or a residential institution.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, among other things, the State would have to provide forthe reporting of known or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect.It is to be anticipated that States will attempt to comply with these requirements.However, a Head Start program, in dealing with and reporting child abuseand neglect, will be subject to and will act in accordance with the lawof the State in which it operates whether or not that law meets the requirementsof the Act. Thus, it is the intention of this policy in the interest ofthe protection of children to insure compliance with and, in some respects,to supplement State or local law, not to supersede it. Thus, the phrase``child abuse and neglect,'' as used herein, refers to both the definitionof abuse and neglect under applicable State or local law, and the evidentiarystandard required for reporters under applicable State or local law.N-30-356-1-30 <T3>Policy</T3>_A. <T3>General provisions. </T3>1. Head start agencies and delegate agenciesmust report child abuse and neglect in accordance with the provisions ofapplicable State or local law.a. In those States and localities with laws which require such reportingby pre-school and day care staff, Head Start agencies and delegate agenciesmust report to the State or local agencies designated by the State underapplicable State or local Child Abuse and Neglect reporting law.b. In those States and localities in which such reporting by pre-schooland day care staff is ``permissive'' under State or local law, Head Startagencies and delegate agencies must report child abuse and neglect if applicableState or local law provides immunity from civil and criminal liabilityfor goodfaith voluntary reporting.2. Head Start agencies and delegate agencies will preserve the confidentialityof all records pertaining to child abuse or neglect in accordance withapplicable State or local law.3. Consistent with this policy, Head Start programs will not undertake,on their own, to treat cases of child abuse and neglect. Head Start programswill, on the other hand, cooperate fully with child protective serviceagencies in their communities and make every effort to retain in theirprograms children allegedly abused or neglected_recognizing that the child'sparticipation in Head Start may be essential in assisting families withabuse or neglect problems.4. With the approval of the policy council, Head Start programs may wishto make a special effort to include otherwise eligible children sufferingfrom abuse or neglect, as referred by the child protective services agency.However, it must be emphasized that Head Start is not nor is it to becomea primary instrument for the treatment of child abuse and neglect. Nevertheless,Head Start has an important preventative role to play in respect to childabuse and neglect.B. <T3>Special provisions</T3>_1. <T3>Staff responsibility. </T3>Directors of Head Start agencies and delegateagencies that have not already done so shall immediately designate a staffmember who will have responsibility for:a. Establishing and maintaining cooperative relationships with the agenciesproviding child protective services in the community, and with any otheragency to which child abuse and neglect must be reported under State law,including regular formal and informal communication with staff at all levelsof the agencies;b. Informing parents and staff of what State and local laws require incases of child abuse and neglect;c. Knowing what community medical and social services are available forfamilies with an abuse or neglect problem;d. Reporting instances of child abuse and neglect among Head Start childrenreportable under State law on behalf of the Head Start program;e. Discussing the report with the family if it appears desirable or necessaryto do so;f. Informing other staff regarding the process for identifying and reportingchild abuse and neglect. (In a number of States it is a statutory requirementfor professional child-care staff to report abuse and neglect. Each programshould establish a procedure for identification and reporting.)2. <T3>Training. </T3>Head Start agencies and delegate agencies shall provideorientation and training for staff on the identification and reportingof child abuse and neglect. They should provide an orientation for parentson the need to prevent abuse and neglect and provide protection for abusedand neglected children. Such orientation ought to foster a helpful ratherthan a punitive attitude toward abusing or neglecting parents and othercaretakers.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 13.600, ProjectHead Start)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 17, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Phillip N.
