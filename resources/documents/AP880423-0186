Prestowitz Jr.   The Washington insiders say the United States must go evenfarther to force other nations to open their markets to U.S.products and protect vital U.S. industries from unfair competition.   Government needs to have a master plan for managing foreigntrade, say the people who are sometimes described as ``economicnationalists.''   According to their theory, Americans are only kidding themselvesby clinging to the idea that other nations will spontaneously droptheir trade barriers out of enlightened self-interest.   In fact, they say, Japan has made a national policy ofprotecting its domestic industries while picking off Americanindustries one at a time.   The United States, which reigned supreme at the end of World WarII, foolishly allowed its economic power to deteriorate at the sametime it was spending billions on its military, the argument goes.   Gephardt ran for president on this platform, and the Missouricongressman continues to believe that the public agrees with himdespite his early exit from the Democratic race. He says he washeld back in the presidential primaries only by a lack of money toget his message across.   Now comes Prestowitz to add meat to the bones of the argumentwith a book called, ``Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Takethe Lead'' (Basic Books, 365 pages).   Prestowitz started the book in 1986 after quitting the Reaganadministration, where he was the Commerce Department's chiefnegotiator on trade with Japan.   Endorsers of the book include such high-technology businessleaders as David Packard, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., andRobert W. Galvin, chairman of Motorola Inc.   Prestowitz says people who oppose government involvement intrade and industry need to recognize that the government is alreadyintimately involved in both areas, only in an inefficient andunplanned way.   ``We do manage trade, but because we kind of back into it andsay that we're not _ winking _ we come up with the worst of allpossible worlds. We protect industries that are practically corpseswithout doing anything to rebuild them,'' Prestowitz said in arecent interview.   No more than 10 percent of world trade is fully free now, theU.S. trade representative's office has estimated. Even the Reaganadministration has import limits, ``voluntary'' or otherwise, oncars, steel, textiles and semiconductors.   ``Let's be honest,'' Prestowitz said. ``Let's recognize whatwe're doing and let's proceed in a way that gives us morebenefits.''   Prestowitz praises the Reagan administration's semiconductoraccord with Japan, which he said made it clear that the governmentwould not let the U.S. chip industry go down the drain.   That public assurance, which is rare in the United States butcommon in Japan, gave companies like Motorola the sense of securitythey needed to make a huge investment in returning to production ofmemory chips.   Gephardt, in an interview Friday, said Prestowitz ``performed agreat service by writing this book. Thre's no one in the countrywho's had more epxierience in trying to get fair trade than ClydePrestowitz.''   Gephardt was the only Democrat in the House who voted againstthe trade bill this past Thursday because he thought it was tooweak. (One other Democratic dissenter, New York's Robert J. Mrazek,thought the bill was too strong.)   Fear is one reason many leaders in government and industry holdback from more aggressive trading practices, Gephardt believes:``Fear that if you disagree with somebody, as we disagree with theRussians all the time, that we'll be accused of unfairness, ofracism.''   In fact, the House-passed trade bill was reviled as``anti-Japanese'' on Friday by Hajime Tamura, Japan's minister ofinternational trade and industry, according to Kyodo News Service.In Japan, ``anti-Japanese'' is almost the same as ``racist.''   The trade bill is the most comprehensive trade legislation since1974 and garnered 24 more votes than the two-thirds necessary tooverride a Reagan veto. A vote in the Senate is expected Tuesday.   The most attention-getting portion of the bill was one that hadalmost nothing to do with trade: a provision requiring 60 days'notice of a plant-closing or long-term layoff by companiesemploying more than 100 people.   More significant was a provision requiring investigation ofcountries with ``pervasive'' unfair trade practices. The governmentcould retaliate if the barriers were not eliminated.   Similarly, industries seriously injured by imports could getprotection if they were willing to make a ``positive adjustment''to foreign competition.   Free traders say the United States is largely to blame for itsfailure to penetrate foreign markets.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
