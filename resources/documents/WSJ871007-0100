A relative of Waldbaum Inc.'s founder, and his former stockbroker were named as defendants in the SEC case, accusing them of using inside information to profit from last year's takeover of Waldbaum by Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co.    The relative, 32-year-old Keith Loeb, settled the SEC civil charges without admitting or denying them. He agreed to surrender $22,653.79 in stock profits, pay an identical civil penalty and cooperate with the SEC.    However, the broker, Robert Chestman, 40, of Gruntal andamp; Co. in New York, intends to fight the SEC charges. &quot;In insider trading cases you sue anything that walks,&quot; protested Mr. Chestman's lawyer, Otto Obermaier. He said his client shouldn't have been included in the case.    Mr. Loeb's wife is the niece of Ira Waldbaum, who founded the Waldbaum supermarket chain, based in Central Islip, N.Y., and is still its chairman. Mr. Waldbaum isn't accused of wrongdoing.    In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here yesterday, the SEC alleged that Mr. Loeb disclosed to Mr. Chestman &quot;material nonpublic information&quot; that Mr. Waldbaum had disclosed in confidence to family members four days before Aandamp;P announced a $50-a-share tender offer for Waldbaum's 5.7 million shares. Mr. Waldbaum, the SEC said, told his sister that she should prepare to deliver her Waldbaum shares to Aandamp;P. The sister then told her daughter, Mr. Loeb's wife, who in turn told him.    Certain Waldbaum family members sold their shares to Aandamp;P as part of a transaction that preceded the tender offer, the SEC explained. The tender offer announcement, on Nov. 26, 1986, came at a time when Waldbaum shares were trading for as low as $24.375 each.    The SEC suit alleges Mr. Loeb telphoned Mr. Chestman and told the broker about the pending takeover. The suit said Mr. Loeb &quot;informed Chestman that he had received highly confidential information&quot; that Aandamp;P would acquire Waldbaum. Mr. Loeb allegedly added that he was undecided whether to &quot;take the risk&quot; of buying Waldbaum stock with the inside data.    As soon as Mr. Loeb hung up, the suit contends, Mr. Chestman went ahead and bought 11,000 Waldbaum shares for himself and for customer accounts he controlled. According to the suit, later in the day, Mr. Loeb called back and ordered 1,000 shares. The suit alleges, Mr. Chestman then sold Mr. Loeb 1,000 of the 11,000 shares, kept for himself 3,000 shares that he had bought at the lowest price, and allocated the remaining 7,000 to eight other client accounts.    The SEC suit demands Mr. Chestman be enjoined from future securities-law violations and that he surrender the profits on the 10,000 shares not allocated to Mr. Loeb, as well as pay a civil penalty under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984.    Thomas H. Sear, Mr. Loeb's attorney, said he doesn't expect related criminal charges to be brought against his client, as is sometimes done in insider cases.    Mr. Obermaier, Mr. Chestman's attorney, said in a formal statement: &quot;We are disappointed that the commission has chosen to proceed in this matter involving a customer's word against his former broker at the time when the customer finds himself in legal difficulty. We intend to contest this matter and remain confident of ultimate vindication.&quot; Gruntal, Mr. Chestman's employer, also in a statement, said: &quot;Robert Chestman is a valued employee who has been with us for many years. He disputes the allegations that have been made. We believe him and intend to be as supportive as possible.&quot;    In Montvale, N.J., Aandamp;P officials didn't have any immediate comment on the case. </TEXT></DOC>
