census conducted by the National Center forComputer Crime Data and The Racal Corp., both of Los Angeles.andP;  The averageannual known computer security losses are $109,000, 365 person hours, and 26computer hours.andP;  Computer crimes against banks are down from 18 percent in1986 to 12 percent; while commercial organizations suffer 36 percent of allcomputer crime, up from 23 percent in 1986.andP;  Consequently, anti-virusproducts will show the greatest increase in usage, from 1.45 percent in 1985to an estimated 53.14 percent in 1991.andM;PCs PLOT OIL SPILLandM;When the Exxon Valdez spilled its crude cargo into Prince William Sound lastMarch, one of the first decisions  made by Alaska's Department ofEnvironmental Conservation was to stock up on laptop computers.andP;  The portablePCs have been used for mapping and database functions such as tracking thedirection of the spill, maintaining records of lost wildlife, coordinatingsearch teams, evaluating test results, and handling emergency work-processingchores.andP;  Exxon even employed Ashton-Tate's dBase IV program for shorelinemapping.andM;FREEDOM TO CHANGEandM;A policy framework that would guarantee continuing public access togovernment information by addressing such media sources as computers,telecommunications, and other forms of electronic publishing has beenproposed by the Information Industry Association (IIA).andP;  The Freedom ofInformation Act (FOIA) has been seriously affected by technological progress,the IIA contends.andP;  New computer and communications technologies havefundamentally reshaped the ways in which information is created, used, anddistributed.andP;  The association has urged a House Subcommittee on GovernmentInformation, Justice, and Agriculture on Federal Information Policy tosupport the establishment of a comprehensive, government-wide policy forinformation dissemination.andM;THE DIRTY DOZENandM;Copyright piracy in 12 countries identified as the world's leading offendersis costing the United States in excess of $1.3 billion a year, according to areport released in April by the International Intellectual Property Alliance(IIPA), Washington,  D.C.andP;  Denial of fair market access represents additionallosses of $95 million annually.andP;  The IIPA, which represents 1,600 companiesthat produce and distribute products including computers and software, listedthe 12 crime areas as the People's Republic of China, Saudia Arabia, Korea,India, the Phillipines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Brazil, Egypt, Thailand, Nigeria,and Malaysia.andM;SUPER LABandM;A new research facility at Los Alamos National Laboratories is looking forsome computer scientists to study and design future generations ofsupercomputers.andP;  Unlike the secretive environment of the New Mexico-basedhost lab, the Advanced Computing Laboratory (ACL) is inviting outsideresearchers to visit and work at the facility.andP;  Interested professionalsshould contact Andy White, ACL director, at (505) 667-6164.andM;EDUCATION POLICYandM;A coalition of leading California businesses has joined politicians inSacramento to urge passage of bipartisan legislation that would prevent thedemise of a broad range of programs using modern technology in the state'sschools.andP;  The &quot;Education Technology Act of 1990&quot; would provide the use ofvarious technologies, including computer networks and customized software,digital communication systems, interactive laser disks, and two-way videoprograms in classrooms statewide.andP;  California is currently ranked 27th amongstates in terms of its use of computer-related equipment in the classroom.andM;DoD DUDandM;Critics of the Department of Defense's Critical Technologies Plan say thereport is evidence of the Pentagon's lack of technology-based policy.andP;  Theplan cites 22 technologies the DoD calls critical to the long-term strengthof U.S.andP;  weaponry, among them software, microelectronics,  and biotechnology.andO;However, there is no mention of methods for tracking expenses or measuringU.S.andP;  competitiveness.andP;  Without a cohesive policy of monitoring the nation'stechnology base, critics say, such planning is without substance.andM;FILM AT 11andM;The existence of an experimental, MIT-developed &quot;personal newspaper&quot; (PN)that may someday replace the need for a daily printed edition, sent a chillover the annual meeting of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.andO;The PN, which would allow users quick access to breaking news stories,sports, weather, and other features, may threaten the future of an ailingprint industry.andP;  Unless newspapers can capture shorter stories, high-qualitygraphics, and a news-you-can-use  style, readership and circulation willcontinue to plummet, say industry observers.andM;ROOM SERVICE 101andM;Students of hotel and restaurant management are studying ways to usecomputers to enhance the hospitality business.andP;  IBM's University and CollegeSystems organization and Cornell University's School of Hotel Administrationhave joined forces in a three-year research project to study computerapplications in hotel and restaurant management.andP;  IBM has contributed $1million worth of PS/2 hardware and software to  the Ithaca, N.Y., locationand on-campus Statler Hotel and J. Willard Marriott Executive EducationCenter.andP;  Students will build a hotel information database to evaluatepotential automation possibilities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
