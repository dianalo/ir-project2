The fear appears exaggerated. Figures just released by the Agriculture Department show 12.4 million acres of farm and forest land in non-U.S. hands at the end of 1986. That's up a modest 3% from 1985 and is actually a bit less than the sum of foreign-controlled acreage five years ago.    All told, outsiders control about 1% of privately held U.S. agricultural land. To put that in perspective, the combined foreign-controlled acreage would cover an area the size of Vermont and New Hampshire.    It was 1978 when Congress, worried that Middle Easterners might be using petrodollars to quietly buy up chunks of the U.S. breadbasket, ordered the Agriculture Department to take an annual inventory of foreign-owned agricultural land. Tracing the ownership hasn't been easy.    In some cases, land is held by corporations set up in offshore tax havens. The Netherlands Antilles, for example, is the home of record for the owners of 756,000 acres of U.S. farmland in states as diverse as California, Iowa and Florida.    Also, the department's definition of &quot;foreign ownership&quot; covers a lot of ground. It includes foreign persons, corporations and partnerships, and U.S. companies with &quot;significant&quot; foreign interest. Significant can mean a foreign stake in a U.S. corporation of as little as 10%.    BUT WHICHEVER WAY you slice the statistics, a foreign land grab doesn't seem to be under way. Last year's increase of 80,000 acres was the smallest annual increase since the department started collecting these figures, although J. Peter DeBraal, who oversees the annual survey, says late reporting could increase the total somewhat.    &quot;I'd like to know why we have such a small total when land values are declining and so is the dollar,&quot; says Mr. DeBraal. &quot;If it was a good buy when it was more expensive, why isn't it a good buy when it's cheaper?&quot;    Maine is the state with by far the biggest foreign land presence because timber is the crop outsiders covet most. Slightly more than half of all foreign-owned acreage in the U.S. is forestland. A full 10% of Maine's privately owned forest reserves, about 1.8 million acres, is held by three foreign paper companies: Irving Pulp andamp; Paper Ltd. and Consolidated Rambler Mines Ltd., both of Canada; and Diamond International Corp., a U.S. company controlled by British financier Sir James Goldsmith.    Oregon, Texas and California reported more than 800,000 foreign-controlled agricultural acres. Louisiana, Florida and Georgia are each over the 500,000-acre mark.    The Agriculture Department says foreigners don't appear to be collecting government subsidies by keeping farm land out of production &quot;to any substantial degree.&quot;    ---   What New Data Say About California   Startling evidence of the impact of California's immigrants on the state's population comes in new Census Bureau figures on household growth. They show that in the six years since the 1980 census, population and the number of households in California grew at exactly the same rate, 14%. In every other state, the number of occupied homes and apartments grew far faster than population.    Two factors seem to be behind California's against-the-grain behavior: a burgeoning Hispanic and Asian immigrant population, which has helped push these two minority groups to more than one-quarter of the state's population, and relatively costly housing, which leads to newly arrived immigrants crowding in with relatives until they earn enough to live separately.    Household growth has accelerated in California and everywhere else in recent years, mostly because the number of young adults, the group that starts the bulk of new households, has grown faster than the population as a whole. The trend toward single-parent homes has also helped push up the household formation rate.    NATIONALLY, HOUSEHOLDS grew 11% between 1980 and 1986, while population grew 6%, says the Census Bureau. In New York, households grew 5%, against population growth of 1%. In North Carolina, the household and population growth rates were 15% and 8%. Only in California, among all the states, do the two rates balance out.    How much bigger are immigrant households in California? In 1985, Hispanic and Asian households (only a portion of which house new arrivals), had one resident more, on average, than white households, according to the Palo Alto-based Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. And the number of these larger-than-average minority households grew five times faster in the first half of the 1980s than white households in California.    Campbell Gibson, who compiled the new census household figures, says California's high housing costs appear to be the main reason for the size of immigrant households. He says it's a mistake to assume that Hispanic immigrants cluster in big households wherever they arrive. &quot;It isn't true in Florida, where (the Hispanic immigrants) are Cuban; or in New York, where they're Puerto Rican, or in Texas, where they're Mexican,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
