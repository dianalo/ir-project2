The new and renewable energy forms thathave the greatest importance, and consequently those of which Canadahas particular experience, are biomass, hydroelectricity, wind and solarenergy, oil sands, and heavy oil. The nature of the Canadian physicaland economic environment has also constrained the development of knowledgeand expertise in key areas such as policy, planning, resource identificationand evaluation, transport and transmission, systems engineering, andlow-temperature studies. The second part of this document discusses theapplication of new and renewable energy technology to developing countries,with emphasis on Canada's possible contribution. Certain technologicalaspects and their applications are disclosed, as well as the social,economic and institutional repercussions on energy policy and planning.The report insists on the fact that any development of energy resourceshas to be part of an integrated energy plan applied within the frameworkof the overall economic, industrial, political, and social objectivesof the country in question. Cooperation between developing countriesthat have similar environments and needs is considered as being oftenmutually advantageous.</TEXT></DOC>
