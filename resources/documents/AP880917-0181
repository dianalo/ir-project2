A year later World War II started.   Instead of being ``appeased'' by the dismemberment ofCzechoslovakia, as the Munich Pact provided, Germany's Adolf Hitlerinvaded Poland.   The pact was, in fact, one of the great stepping stones towardwar.   A half century later, world politics is still being shaped bythe lessons learned, the lessons unlearned and the lessonsforgotten from the Munich Pact.   ``The sort of attitude _ `Let's not have another Munich' _ hasbecome a way of thinking about international politics, particularlyon the more conservative side,'' said Reinhold Meyers, a WestGerman political scientist and specialist on the Munich Pact.   Meyers added that is at least partially reflected in thecontinuing mistrust between East and West.   ``Munich has become a sort of ideological catchword because itstands for a policy of capitulation,'' Meyers said in an interview.   The Munich talks were a last-ditch attempt, led by Chamberlain,to appease Hitler's militaristic craving for ``Lebensraum'' (livingspace) and avoid war.   Hitler was threatening to invade Czechoslovakia, which wouldhave triggered an immediate European war because of France'scommitment to protect the Czechs and Britain's alliance with theFrench.   ``The Munich Pact was not only one of the most important stepsleading to World War II, but it has also become a symbol ofsuccessful political blackmail,'' said Hermann Graml, a top WestGerman historian.   Chamberlain, Premier Edouard Daladier of France, Hitler and hisally in Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini, began the MunichConference on Sept. 29, 1938.   Czechoslovak leaders were excluded as Hitler demanded.   The site of the talks, a long, three-story, barracks-likestructure built just three years earlier, still stands and is amusic school.   But Hitler's private office, where the four leaders met,disappeared long ago in postwar renovations.   Firsthand accounts of the four-power meeting describe the Nazileader as extremely volatile and ready to wage war if he wasn'tgiven Czechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland.   ``Hitler was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood _ a veryunattractive character,'' the British statesman Lord Home, whoaccompanied Chamberlain as his aide, said in a recent interviewwith The Associated Press at his estate in Scotland.   Daladier, writing years after the meeting, said of the start ofthe discussions: ``Hitler arose and delivered a diatribe againstthe Czechs. It was a real explosion. Spreading his arms orclenching his fists, he accused the Czechs of a frightful tyrannyover the Sudeten Germans.''   Historians say Hitler had used the argument ofself-determination for Czechoslovakia's minority Germans as apropaganda device to justify his claims upon the bordering nation.   ``What he really believed in was the right of supposedlyracially superior Germans to dominate other people,'' Graml, aMunich University professor, said during an interview at his office.   At one point during the discussions, Chamberlain objected toHitler's stipulation that Czechs who would evacuate their nation's11,000-square-mile Sudetenland, an area slightly larger thanMaryland, could not even take their cattle.   Paul Schmidt, Hitler's translator during the conference, wrotein later years that the Nazi leader responded impatiently: ``Ourtime is too valuable to be wasted on such trivialities.''   Chamberlain dropped the matter.   Faced with a hostile Nazi leader who appeared ready to throw allof Europe into war if he didn't get what he wanted, the Munich Pactwas signed.   Leaders from all over the world welcomed the agreement and whatlooked like a last-minute escape from war.   But Winston Churchill said the pact had shamed his country.   ``You were given the choice between war and dishonor,''Churchill told Chamberlain later. ``You chose dishonor and willhave war.''   Hitler was given the Sudetenland, but it quickly became obvioushe had no intention of keeping his vow to be satisfied with justthat.   In March 1939, German troops overran the rest of Czechoslovakia.   Six months later German troops marched into Poland, and soon theworld's major powers, including France and Britain, were embroiledin a war that did not end until Nazi Germany's defeat in May 1945.   Many modern-day historians, like Meyers, say Chamberlain had nochoice but to sign the Munich Pact, arguing that Britain could nothave withstood a major war at that time.   ``The British could not afford to go to war in September 1938because of the negative status of its air force, and they hadhardly any expeditionary force at all,'' said Meyers, a professorat Muenster University.   But the Munich Pact has left a lot of bitter memories.   Some French historians say the Munich accord may be one reasonthere has never been a strong French pacifist movement since WorldWar II.   ``Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by Munich,'' saidJean-Pierre Azema, a historian at Paris' Political ScienceInstitute.   The Czechoslovaks, the sacrificial victims of the Munich Pact,also have bitter recollections of the infamous accord.   Czechoslovakia was rebuilt after World War II and Communistleaders were installed.   This past February, Milos Jakes, Czechoslovakia's new CommunistParty leader, defended the Communist takeover in 1948 as aguarantee that the nation's alliance with the Soviet Union had ridit of dependence ``on imperialist states, for which a tragic pricewas paid after Munich.''   But Hitler's invasion was replayed 30 years later with theSoviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the 1968``Prague Spring'' reform movement.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sun Sept. 25</NOTE></DOC>
