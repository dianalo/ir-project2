The influence of rotation andstructural factors on the flow in a siphon pip is studied. It is shownthat the flow is in the laminar state at a rotation speed of 300-1, 800rpm and heat flow rate of 10{sup 4} to 2 x 10{sup 5}W/m{sup 2}. The secondaryflow is generated by the Coriolis force, leading to drift of the flowin the passage. Natural and forced convections coexist in a pipe of asmall diameter ratio. The heat transfer coefficient is examined in relationto the flow condition, secondary ratio and diameter ratio. Heat transferequations are derived which apply to cases with or without a secondaryflow. Equations are also given which serve to determine the rotationaland structural conditions affecting the transition range of the secondaryflow. (22 figs, 2 tabs, 21 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
