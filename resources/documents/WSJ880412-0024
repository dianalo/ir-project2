There's a time and a place for asking, most companies say.    At Security Pacific Corp., pay increases come with the formal annual review. &quot;We've got a system laid in stone,&quot; says Susan Taha, director of corporate communications. Thomas Stanton, chairman of National Westminster Bancorp. NJ, says he'd &quot;be hard-pressed to recall&quot; the last time anyone asked for a raise outside a performance review. &quot;It's absolutely the most effective time to do it,&quot; he declares.    Millard Pryor, chairman of Lydall Inc., tries to award raises to valued employees before they ask. And askers, he warns, had better be prepared for the consequences if boss and worker don't agree on how well a job is being done. Nick Arvanitidis, chairman of Liposome Technology Inc., recalls how one worker surveyed the competition to prove that comparable employees elsewhere were getting paid more. Mr. Arvanitidis fired him; &quot;he didn't deserve a good salary,&quot; the executive says.    When workers run into financial trouble, some companies counsel or extend credit rather than boost pay.    HOSPITALS RECRUIT doctors aggressively to fill needs and beds.    &quot;I don't know of a hospital today that is not doing some kind of recruiting of physicians,&quot; says Rita Connolly, a vice president of Delaware County (Pa.) Memorial Hospital. Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta searches for neurosurgeons willing to handle trauma cases. Bon Secours Hospitals of Michigan has added 75 doctors for its 12 facilities since 1982. Community Hospital in Lancaster, Pa., is willing to pay moving costs to lure family practitioners, neurosurgeons and oncologists to affiliate.    While much of the searching is aimed at filling specific voids, Jackson andamp; Coker, a medical recruiter, says declining admissions and increasing competition also prompt hospitals to seek more M.D.s. &quot;Physicians,&quot; it explains, &quot;serve as distributors of the hospital's services.&quot; More doctors on staff can mean more business for the hospital.    BUSINESS SCHOOL applications show only slight gains.    Stanford University says its M.B.A. applications for next fall are running a bare 1% to 3% ahead of last year, when the school had a 10% rise. At Harvard, applications flow in at about the same pace as last year. Dartmouth says it's up 10%, but much of that increase comes from overseas. Nationally, candidates sitting for the Graduate Management Admission Test were up 2%.    Graduate business school officials don't have any pat answers for this year's pattern. At the University of Virginia, where applications are off about 5% from last year's record, admissions director Rosalyn Berne says she has a &quot;hunch&quot; that talk of a recession may be making people &quot;more antsy about leaving their jobs.&quot; Northwestern, one of the big gainers with an 18% rise, doesn't have any firmer reason for its success than &quot;momentum.&quot;    Fewer applicants seek investment banking careers; those that do are defensive about the choice.    MEDIAN CASH COMPENSATION paid to chief executives of the nation's top 100 industrial companies exceeded $1 million last year for the first time, consultant Towers Perrin says. CEO salaries and bonuses came to $1,087,500, up 13% from 1986 for those who held the job both years.    SOME SECURITY: Only 60% of the members of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers think their current employer will be in business by the year 2000. What's more, 43% believe they won't be with the same company by the 21st century.    THE TRENCH COAT gets them. Executives accept overseas assignments for personal rather than career reasons, consultant Moran, Stahl andamp; Boyer says. Expatriate managers, a survey shows, relish the travel and adventure far more than the chance to take on an exciting foreign job.    COLLECT CALLS: Two-thirds of the major companies surveyed by recruiter Korn/Ferry International say they pay outside directors an average of $712 for each telephone conference in which they participate. And the vast majority get the full fee no matter how long they're on the line.    AMERICA'S JOB MARKET is more volatile than you think, an economist suggests.    While attention focuses each month on national employment figures released by the Labor Department, &quot;the aggregate statistics hide huge job losses and gains,&quot; says Jonathan Leonard of the University of California. By Mr. Leonard's reckoning, American business each year adds one worker to every eight on the payroll at the same time as one-ninth of workers leave jobs.    Mr. Leonard says relatively little of this employment turmoil can be laid to companies being born or those going under. At the heart of the turbulence are ongoing businesses, he contends. &quot;When a company grows unusually fast one year, the best bet is that it will shrink the next year,&quot; he says. &quot;Firms seem to overreact to market conditions with an expansion and contraction, boom-or-bust pattern.&quot;    Companies should smooth the employment cycle by subcontracting more work during peak demand, he says.    THE CHECKOFF: &quot;Terminal operator&quot; is one company's job title for a mortician, Personnel Journal says. . . . Those must have been trying years: The CIA runs an ad telling former spouses divorced from agency personnel before 1982 that they may be eligible for lifetime annuities. </TEXT></DOC>
