Such a pathology is quite frequent in youngathletes, at various stages. The patients were grouped in two categories,according to their age when the trauma occurred, and to the peculiaritiesof both entesopathic localization and imaging. The use of both techniques,either one prevaling over the other according to the different evolutivephases of enthesopathies, provides useful information as to detectingand determining the disease. Finally, the authors recommend a combineduse of these techniques, especially in young athletes, possibly avoidingconventional X-rays.</TEXT></DOC>
