(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The judge at Jim Bakker's fraud trialruled today it would be a waste of time to take the jury on a tourof PTL's former resort.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter also prodded Bakker's lawyersto end their parade of satisfied PTL ``lifetime partners'' _ $1,000contributors who were promised three nights' lodging a year at theministry's hotels.   By midmorning today, 42 of the contributors had testified theynever were mistreated by Bakker. One witness said that he wouldbelieve Bakker if the TV evangelist claimed he could stuff a maninto a water pitcher.   In testimony today, George Tinker, a retired electrician fromChester, S.C., said he bought a $1,000 lifetime partnership in theunfinished Towers hotel because Bakker said it would include ahealth club.   ``I married a sweet young woman,'' Tinker said. ``To keepabreast of my body, I lift weights and I walk.''   Tinker said he was satisfied with his treatment at PTL untilBakker resigned in 1987 and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who took overthe ministry, ``began to low-rate our pastor.''   ``He began to say things I personally felt were untrue,'' Tinkersaid. ``He was quite mean, so I quit going.'' Falwell had accusedBakker of greed and immorality.   Bakker, who is accused of cheating contributors of $3.7 millionby overselling partnerships and using the money to live in highstyle, faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 million infines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   PTL partners testifying for the government said they sometimeswere turned away when they tried to reserve rooms.   Jurors have seen Heritage USA, Bakker's Christian retreat innearby Fort Mill, S.C., on videotape. But defense attorney HaroldBender asked Potter for permission for the 12 jurors and sixalternates to visit the complex, which has been closed by abankruptcy court trustee.   Potter sided with the prosecution, which argued that a visitwould be a waste of time.   Arnold Santjer, who said he owned 76 lifetime partnerships inPTL costing a total of $76,000, testified Wednesday that he stillhas faith in Bakker. Santjer owns a ship-loading business inBradenton, Fla.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller pressed Santjer oncross-examination. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Miller pointed to awater pitcher on a table and asked Santjer: ``If Mr. Bakker said hecould fit me inside that pitcher, do you believe he could do it?''   ``If he thinks he could, yes,'' Santjer replied.   The judge on Wednesday clashed with Bender in a hearing outsidethe presence of the jury about the number of lifetime partnerstestifying for the defense. Potter said his policy is to limitlawyers to five character witnesses.   ``We have not put up anyone for the purpose of specificallybeing a character witness,'' Bender told Potter. ``These are thepartners, judge. People who have put their money into thisministry.''</TEXT></DOC>
