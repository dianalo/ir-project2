(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tropical storm rolled ashore Sunday,bringing heavy rain and strong winds that destroyed more than adozen mobile homes, killing one person, and left thousandstemporarily without power.   Just six hours after Tropical Storm Chris became the third namedstorm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season early Sunday, it movedover land and weakened. But it still packed enough power todevastate trailers in a sparsely populated wooded area about 75miles inland from this historic port city.   ``The winds took a swath, probably a half a mile long and aquarter of a mile wide,'' said Clarendon County Fire Chief CarterJones. He said one person was killed and another seriously injuredin a mobile home three miles south of Manning, and a dozen or moretrailers were destroyed in a sales lot.   The winds snapped tree limbs across eastern South Carolina, andtornadoes associated with the same weather pattern tore up treesand roofs in North Carolina.   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warningfrom Savannah, Ga., to Cape Hatteras, N.C., for much of the day. By6 p.m., the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression,located near Columbia with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph insqualls.   The hurricane center warned of coastal flooding and recommendedthat small craft stay in port from Brunswick, Ga., to VirginiaBeach, Va., until winds and seas subsided.   Rain from the storm was expected to reach as far north asnorthern New Jersey, southeastern New York and Long Island byMonday, the weather service in New York City said.   Winds measured in gusts up to 44 mph in Charleston cut power toan estimated 18,000 customers in coastal South Carolina anddestroyed one mobile home and overturned another near the communityof Olanta near Florence.   The storm, which had maximum sustained wind of 50 mph while overthe ocean, rolled over land at 20 mph shortly after noon, theNational Hurricane Center said.   ``It's such a weak storm. There's no eye or anything likethat,'' said forecaster John Townsend of the weather service inCharleston. ``The only thing we're worrying about is some floodingdue to rainfall and tides.''   The weather service said 1.72 inches of rain fell between 5:45p.m. and 6:45 p.m. in the Columbia area and produced standing wateron roads, including Interstate 26, that contributed to trafficproblems and accidents.   Forecasters predicted 3 to 5 inches of rain along the storm'sprojected track across South Carolina and into North Carolina.   Sheriffs' dispatchers said tornadoes uprooted trees, damagedmobile homes and tore shingles off roofs but no injuries werereported in Alexander, Catawba and Iredell counties in westerncentral North Carolina.   ``They're not directly associated with Chris, but the flowpattern around the storm brings in moisture from the Atlantic andthat's what causing this kind of thing,'' said Bob Muller of theNational Weather Service at the Raleigh-Durham Airport.   Damages were estimated as high as $1 million in Iredell County,where wind threw a tractor-trailer rig into a building at IredellContainer Co. in Statesville, said Al Warlick, a spokesman for thestate Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.   A tornado in Cumberland County damaged four houses in asubdivision and destroyed a produce stand north of Fayetteville,authorities said.   Steve Vann, 21, of Goldsboro, said he was helping his uncle moveinto a home when a tornado ripped apart Percy Currin's producestand.   ``I seen it hit the ground about 3:30 p.m. The wind got towhipping up pretty good, clouds moving in a tornadolike motion,then it quit raining. All of a sudden, it came out of nowhere,''Vann said. ``It sounded just like somebody throwing a match ongasoline _ Whoosh!''   Scattered power outages affected about 12,000 South CarolinaElectric andamp; Gas Co. customers in the Charleston and Beaufort areas,said Becky McSwain, a spokeswoman for the utility, which servesabout half the state.   During Saturday and into early Sunday, Chris strengthened into atropical storm from a lopsided tropical depression that threatenedFlorida's eastern coast. Depressions are upgraded to tropicalstorms when their maximum sustained wind hits 39 mph, and tohurricanes when sustained wind blows at least at 74 mph.   On Saturday, the system drenched the Bahamas with about 5 inchesof rain.   Earlier the depression, which began forming one week ago Sunday,dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico, causing mud slides andflooding that killed at least three people and damaged more than100 homes, Civil Defense officials said.   The last named storm to hit South Carolina was tropical stormKate in 1985, which came ashore as a hurricane in the Floridapanhandle. That storm flooded roads, left thousands without powerand was blamed for at least one death in South Carolina.</TEXT></DOC>
