Indeed, hardliners on the extreme right contend that Mr. Reagan has turned soft on Moscow.    Mr. Reagan has become &quot;a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda,&quot; Howard Phillips, president of the Conversative Caucus, charged last week.    Most conservatives fault the treaty for three broad reasons: Some say it is geopolitically flawed because it will &quot;decouple&quot; the U.S. from its European allies; others worry that it is technically weak and doesn't provide adequate verification, and some remain wary because they just don't trust the Soviets.    &quot;We have all been down the road of the arms-control process before,&quot; says Burton Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation. &quot;It's something the Soviets took great advantage of in the 1970s. The process stopped us, in effect, from doing almost anything to maintain our arsenal, while the Soviets moved ahead at a steady clip. We don't want to repeat that process.&quot;    Of course, the treaty has many strong Republican supporters. Sen. Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, applauds the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons and says the safeguards are sufficient to prevent cheating. &quot;We can't trust the Soviets, and this treaty doesn't require us to do that,&quot; he says.    Opponents who fault the pact on geopolitical grounds cluster around Mr. Kissinger, the former secretary of state. He says that installation of U.S. intermediate-range missiles in Europe beginning in 1983 &quot;coupled&quot; the U.S. with its allies by making it more likely that American weapons would be used to defend against a Soviet attack in Europe. Now, Mr. Kissinger warns, this &quot;organic link&quot; is broken, and Soviet intimidation could lead to a long-cherished Soviet goal -- the neutralization of Europe.    A former Reagan-administration Pentagon official, Frank Gaffney, says the U.S. rushed into the treaty without thoroughly examining whether it could be adequately verified. He worries, for instance, that there isn't a provision for random short-notice, on-site inspections at suspicious locations, and that there hasn't been a sufficiently intensive exchange of data about the arsenal of weapons being destroyed.    Mr. Gaffney's former Pentagon boss, Richard Perle, also is concerned, but he doesn't reject the &quot;zero-zero&quot; agreement. He, after all, is its father. It was Mr. Perle who conceived of offering not to deploy U.S. cruise and Pershing missiles if Moscow agreed to withdraw the SS-20s it already had in place. It was a bad deal for the Russians, since it wasn't clear whether European voters would ever allow the U.S. deployment. But it permitted conservatives to champion arms reduction and outflank the nuclear-freeze movement.    When Mr. Gorbachev accepted the offer, after the successful U.S. deployment, most conservatives ran for cover, leaving Mr. Reagan in the unaccustomed position of being on the left wing of his party and allied with Democratic doves.    Now, many conservatives plan to push for changes in the treaty on the Senate floor. For some, this is a way to be both for and against the pact. Presidential candidate Alexander Haig, for example, says it would unnerve U.S. allies if the treaty were killed at this point. However, he advocates so-called killer amendments that Moscow would find unacceptable, such as tying the agreement to a reduction in long-range missiles.    Other conservatives predict a prolonged ratification process. This would guarantee not only a comprehensive review of the pact but also head off what they see as another disaster by leaving little time for Mr. Reagan to complete a more significant accord with Moscow on strategic, or long-range, arms. </TEXT></DOC>
