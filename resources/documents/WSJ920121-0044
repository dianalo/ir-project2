Licensed shipboard officers vote to dissolve the 1988merger of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association'slargest district with the National Maritime Union. Thedissidents, who swept elections of the licensed division'sofficers and board members in 1990, say the merger wasfraudulent and diluted the MEBA pension fund. They vote tohave a new, &quot;fair&quot; membership vote on a merger, and to havenew elections of the MEBA unit.</LP><TEXT>   The merged union's executive committee counters by votingto put the licensed division into trusteeship; PresidentClayton DeFries says the dissidents acted illegally.Delegates to a special convention that he called decided togive union members a second chance to vote on the merger, butthe dissidents say the convention was rigged.   Heads of five other maritime unions, including theSeafarers and the Masters, Mates andamp; Pilots, back thedissidents against the union leaders' &quot;insidious activities.&quot;                                                                                                          LONGER HOURS, not pay rises, boost most families' income.   A Joint Economic Committee staff study shows that adultsin 80% of two-parent American families with children workedmore hours in 1989 than in 1979, but that their incomesdidn't rise commensurately. Using Census Bureau data, thestudy showed that real hourly pay, adjusted for inflation,fell for husbands in 60% of the families over the decade.   While real hourly pay of wives rose for most families, thedecline in husbands' pay was greater than their wives' wageincreases for 60% of families. Only families in the top 20%of the income hierarchy had &quot;clear gains in their standard ofliving.&quot; A 13% rise in hours by wives did more to sustainfamily incomes than any increases in their hourly pay;husbands' hours rose 2%.                                                                                                          `PAY-OR-PLAY': Many employers would rather switch thanfight.   Chrysler Corp. would drop its health insurance foremployees and instead pay into a public pool for uninsuredpeople if the proposed tax costs less than the amount --nearly 17% of payroll -- Chrysler spends on health coverage.Bills pushed by many Democrats would let companies pay taxesof 7% or 9% of payroll in lieu of direct coverage.   An Urban Institute study concludes that employers wouldshift 35% of workers they currently cover to the public plan.CodeAlarm, whose health costs total 7% of payroll, would be&quot;tempted&quot; to switch. Southern California Edison, with a 12%tab, would consider it. But Bethlehem Steel and HughesAircraft say they probably would keep their health plansbecause they could give workers better coverage.   Employer medical costs averaged 9.9% of payrolls in 1990;manufacturers' costs averaged 11.6%, according to a Chamberof Commerce survey.                                                                                                          STARTING TOMORROW, North Adams (Mass.) State College willpermit up to 60 unemployed residents of the town, which hasan 11% jobless rate, to fill empty classroom seats for free.They can take speaking, writing, computer, or other classesthat help them bone up on weak job skills, or even philosophyor literature.                                                                                                          PAY MISMATCH: Salaries and bonuses for biotechnologyexecutives rose as much as 39% in 1991, though losses climbed283%, says Strategic Compensation andamp; Research Associates. Anddespite a severe real-estate recession, top executives inresidential mortgage banking and other real-estate-orientedfirms enjoyed compensation rises of up to 15% in 1991, saysconsultant Ferguson Partners.                                                                                                          RISING PESSIMISM about the economic outlook trims somesails. Now, 73% of chief executives from fast-growing,smaller firms report they're hiring. That's down from 75%three months earlier, according to a survey of 210 chiefexecutives by consultant Coopers andamp; Lybrand. Those cuttingstaff rose to 7% from 2%.                                                                                                          A BETTER WORK FORCE emerges from the recession, firms say.   Workers are &quot;living in the real world now,&quot; says RobertBrown, an official of Uno Restaurant Corp., Boston; he saysthey're more committed and don't push for wage increases asmuch. Northeast Federal, a Hartford, Conn., financial holdingfirm, says employees are more willing to make pay sacrificesto help turn the company around, and they know &quot;good timesdon't go on forever.&quot;   Teradyne, a Boston manufacturer of semiconductor testers,says workers took a wage deferral &quot;generally well.&quot; EnserchCorp., Dallas, says employees trust management more andbetter understand cuts in retiree medical benefits. In asurvey of 100 employers by Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas, aChicago placement firm, 34 cited greater productivity as thechief recession gain; others cited fewer sick days taken,more interest in adding job skills and less absenteeism.   But Intel, Pacific Gas and Electric and Wells Fargo see norecent change in worker attitudes.
