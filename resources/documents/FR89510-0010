Box 369, Antioch, CA 94509, Snowden Enterprises,Inc., P.O. Box 751, Fresno CA 93712, Frupac International, Corp., 400 MarketStreet, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA 19106, and Quimica Osku, Ltda, 853,Agustinas Street, Office No. 831, Santiago, Chile, proposing to amend 40CFR Part 180 by establishing a tolerance to permit residues of the fungicidesulfur dioxide in or on grapes at 20 parts per million (ppm).The petitioners subsequently amended the petition, proposing to establisha tolerance to permit residues of sulfur dioxide in or on grapes at 10parts per million, the current level of detection determined by the modifiedMonier-William Method used by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forits enforcement procedures.Fifty-seven commenters, representing the California grape growing, shipping,and packing industry as well as Chilean grape importers and sodium metabisulfitepad manufacturers, supported the establishment of a tolerance to permitresidues of sulfur dioxide in or on grapes at 10 ppm. There were no requestsfor referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposedrule.One commenter contended that there are no scientific studies which reportany adverse health effects resulting from ingestion of table grapes withsulfite levels at or below 20 ppm.EPA disagrees with the commenter. EPA has evaluated the data which promptedFDA to announce in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 9, 1986 (51 FR 25021), that the use ofsulfiting agents as preservatives on raw fruits and vegetables served orsold to consumers was no longer deemed to be generally recognized as safe.EPA has concluded that these data demonstrate that a tolerance level inexcess of 10 ppm would pose an unacceptable risk to sulfite-sensitive individuals.The commenter also argued that the establishment of a 10-ppm tolerancefor sulfur dioxide residues would be unnecessarily restrictive to tradeand urged EPA to adopt a higher level of 20 ppm.Based on an evaluation of the data developed during the California andChilean certification programs, EPA has determined that with appropriateindustry controls involving the use of sulfur dioxide, the majority of,if not all, shipments of imported and domestic grapes can maintain theproposed 10-ppm tolerance level. Therefore, EPA has concluded that theestablishment of a 10-ppm tolerance for sulfur dioxide residues in or ongrapes would not be restrictive to trade nor offer a competitive advantagefor either foreign or domestic suppliers of grapes.Several commenters discussed the analytical methodology to be used forenforcement of the final rule. Specifically, one commenter recommendedan alternative methodology for determining sulfite residues, one commenterrecommended retention of the modified Monier-Williams Method currentlyused by FDA for its enforcement purposes, and one commenter requested thatEPA consider revising the tolerance level if more sensitive levels of detectionare developed.Currently, the only validated analytical methodology for determining sulfurdioxide residues on grapes is the modified Monier-Williams Method as publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 9, 1986 (51 FR 25017). The industry mayuse an analytical methodology of its choice for determining sulfur dioxideresidues as long as it is confident that the results obtained from thismethod are compatible with those obtained by the modified Monier-WilliamsMethod. However, EPA will not accept such data as supporting a tolerancefor sulfur dioxide residues in or on grapes until the method has been validatedand submitted to EPA for review. If a more sensitive analytical methodhas been developed and can be validated, EPA will consult with FDA to considerits appropriateness for enforcement purposes. At the same time, EPA willalso consider revising the tolerance level.Two commenters argued that collecting and sampling for sulfur dioxide residuesbe conducted under actual use conditions rather than on a worst-case basis.Since FDA is responsible for determining if sulfur dioxide residues inor on grapes are in compliance with the tolerance, EPA does not believeit would be appropriate to comment on the collecting and sampling methodsused by FDA in FDA's enforcement procedures. Instead, commenters who wishto propose revisions to the methods used by FDA in its enforcement of thetolerance should direct their proposals for consideration by FDA to thefollowing address: Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food andDrug Administration, 200 C St., SW., Washington, DC 20204.The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material havebeen evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data andinformation considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protectthe public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forthbelow. Establishment of this tolerance will supersede all interim policyrequirements, including certification, which will no longer be a permissiblemeans of enforcement for detection of sulfur dioxide residues.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.A hearing will be granted if the objections are supported by grounds legallysufficient to justify the relief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
