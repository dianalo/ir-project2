Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> PCS CMD MON FRX </IN><TEXT>   The dollar's latest decline steepened yesterday, contributing to a sell-off in the bond market and causing early weakness in the stock market before prices stabilized somewhat.    The dollar again fell to its lowest levels since January against most major currencies, especially the British pound. Traders cited a widespread belief that economic conditions are more favorable outside the U.S., particularly in Britain and Japan.    Meanwhile, some long-term U.S. bond prices tumbled $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount, their worst showing since early this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.82 to 1979.77, but broader stock market indexes were down.    The pound's 2% rise against the dollar yesterday, to $1.8705 in late New York trading from $1.8335 Friday, was the day's biggest move among major exchange rates. But the dollar's slide against the Japanese yen remained a dominant concern in the market. Traders said it came in spite of renewed intervention by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan in support of the U.S. currency.    Robert A. White, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said, &quot;People are starting to ask the question, 'Is this the beginning of a free fall?'&quot; Mr. White, however, said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot;    One worrying aspect of the dollar's latest downturn, traders said, is that the selling pressure this time isn't coming from speculative quarters, such as the major players in the interbank market.    Instead, they said, the current selling impetus comes from Japanese exporters and investment companies, who are unloading excess dollars acquired through trade or are moving funds back to Japan to take advantage of the economic expansion there.    &quot;People are focusing on the Japanese economy and the Japanese stock market,&quot; Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader for Bank of Tokyo Ltd. in New York, said.    The spectacular rally in sterling yesterday followed remarks by Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton that Britain's anti-inflation policies are taking precedence over holding the pound's value within a narrow range. The comments were made in London to a parliamentary panel.    Mr. Leigh-Pemberton's remarks reinforced a British policy switch announced this month that propelled the pound higher. The comments removed concern in the market that the Bank of England might try to block a further rise in sterling's value by intervening in the market to dump pounds. Relatively high interest rates, Britain's main weapon against inflation, are attracting investors to sterling.    The dollar's 1% drop against the Japanese currency, to 123.75 yen late yesterday from 125.05 Friday, could have been much sharper if not for the large dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan during Tokyo trading and additional buying by the Fed. The Japanese central bank bought about $300 million yesterday, traders said. The Fed's intervention in the New York market was said to be less aggressive.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 124.40 yen, up from 123.88 yen at the opening. The unit's rise was attributed partly to further reported intervention by the Bank of Japan.    A strong Japanese economy, reflected in the resurgent Tokyo stock market, is the main magnet for the flow of capital into yen.    &quot;This move isn't based on dollar weakness, but yen strength,&quot; a trader in New York said.    The Tokyo stock market has rallied in recent weeks to near the record levels it reached in the middle of last October, just before the world stock market crash. Although the dollar's three-year drop against the yen has hurt Japan's exports, the domestic economy has stepped forward to take up the slack. A recent report by Goldman Sachs International Corp., London, forecasts 3.8% growth for Japan this year, compared with 1.6% growth for the U.S. and 1.7% for West Germany.    Goldman Sachs economists also predict a 1% Japanese inflation rate for 1988, compared with 4% for the U.S.    &quot;There are fundamental reasons why the yen should be strengthening,&quot; First Interstate's Mr. White said.    In Washington, U.S. officials were taking the dollar's continued but steady decline calmly, even though it has fallen below the level of about 126 yen that it held last Dec. 22, when the Group of Seven major industrial nations called for a halt to its decline.    The officials contended that much of the dollar's current decline is related to this Thursday's ending of the Japanese fiscal year and that the Japanese companies' actions are driven more by accounting considerations than by economic fundamentals. For this reason, the Fed hasn't been intervening on a large scale to support the dollar.    The U.S. officials said the dollar is still comfortably above the low of around 120 yen that it hit in the first days of 1988, when the Fed and other central banks intervened heavily and noisily to prevent a potential dollar collapse.    However, the officials conceded that if the dollar decline accelerates or proves relentless into April, government concern and Fed activity might increase.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.60 an ounce to $455.80 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.3 million ounces.    ---   Walter S.
