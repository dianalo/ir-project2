Jonathan Ashley Battle, 23, who has no medical degree, spent atleast three weeks at Jackson Memorial Hospital and had acquired 21keys to doctors offices, Metro-Dade police say.   ``They were keys even security didn't have access to,'' saidRobert NeeDelman, an officer assigned to the hospital. ``This guy isreally something else.''   Police were investigating whether Battle, arrested Nov. 20 andcharged with burglary and theft, ever actually examined patientsduring his hospital rounds.   A nurse became suspicious of Battle when he entered alabor-delivery scrub room wearing gloves from a neighboringhospital. Questioned about what he was doing, Battle gave the nameof a patient he planned to examine. After the patient's name didn'tshow up in hospital records, the nurse called security.   Battle had created his own University of Miami medical schoolphoto ID card identifying him as a doctor, NeeDelman said.   Battle was scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 12 on charges ofburglary, a second-degree felony, and petty theft, a misdemeanor.   He can't be charged with impersonating a doctor because nostatute exists, said Leslie Rothenberg, assistant state attorney inthe felony screening unit.</TEXT></DOC>
