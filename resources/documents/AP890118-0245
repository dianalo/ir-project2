The 62-year-old son of a Texas cattle foreman, a holdover fromthe last months of the Reagan administration, has been busilymending many of the fences bashed by former Education SecretaryWilliam Bennett.   ``We're all on the side of the angels,'' Cavazos said last Sept.21, his first day on the job. ``So we have no problems.''   The first Hispanic to serve in the Cabinet is a Democrat who inthe past criticized proposed Reagan education cuts. He was presidentof Texas Tech University and its medical school when PresidentReagan tapped him as education secretary.   A soft-spoken political novice, he has generally kept a lowprofile. He is respected by the education community and won Senateconfirmation 94-0.   Cavazos has vowed to fight for ``the best funding possible'' andhas pledged to focus federal services on high-risk children. Hisother priorities include cutting the dropout rate, improvingteaching and boosting spending on the Pell Grant program fordisadvantaged college and vocational students.   Cavazos, who has a doctorate in physiology, was dean of the TuftsUniversity medical school before moving on to Texas Tech.   _By Jill Lawrence</TEXT><NOTE>ATTORNEY GENERAL</NOTE><TEXT>   The biggest change Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has noticedat the Justice Department since he ran the criminal division 11years ago is the agency's increased international focus.   The attorney general says one of his top priorities is tostreamline and centralize international operations that focus on therise of international drug trafficking, money laundering andterrorism.   Thornburgh's successful prosecutions of organized crime, publiccorruption and drug trafficking while U.S. attorney for westernPennsylvania led to his 1975 appointment by President Ford asassistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division.   In 1978, Thornburgh was elected to the first of two four-yearterms as Pennsylvania governor. His calm handling of the Three MileIsland nuclear power plant crisis just weeks after he took office in1979 won him widespread acclaim.   The 56-year-old attorney general was a member of his party'sliberal wing early in his political career, opposing the Vietnam Warand supporting New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for president in1968.   But like fellow Yale graduate George Bush, Thornburgh has movedslowly to the right of the political center.   Thornburgh was appointed by President Reagan last summer torestore the Justice Department's image and moral after the lengthyspecial prosecutor's probe of his predecessor, Edwin Meese III.   _By James Rowley</TEXT><NOTE>DEFENSE</NOTE><TEXT>   John Goodwin Tower is a former U.S. senator and political insiderwho for years has coveted the job he's about to take on for GeorgeBush _ secretary of defense.   The 63-year-old Tower, a diminutive man in stature but describedby friends as ``willing to play hardball anytime,'' is a Texasnative who fought as an enlisted sailor during World War II and thenwent on to become a defense expert in the U.S. Senate.   At the time he retired in 1985 after 24 years on Capitol Hill, hewas the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and hadhelped Ronald Reagan push his military buildup through Congress. Heearlier had made a name for himself as an expert on the details ofweapon systems and defense policy and as a conservative critic ofthe Soviet Union.   Tower wanted to head the Pentagon under Reagan, but lost outfirst to Caspar W. Weinberger and then in 1987, to Frank C. Carlucci.   After retiring from the Senate, Tower became a high-pricedWashington consultant _ with major defense contractors on his clientlist _ but interrupted that life to serve as an arms controlnegotiator for Reagan and then as the head of the presidential panelthat investigated the Iran-Contra scandal.   Known as a pragmatist who prefers backroom negotiating to publicposturing, Tower has been unable to avoid the glare of publicity inhis private life. Twice divorced, he has been the subject of rumorsabout womanizing raised by his second wife during divorceproceedings and about excessive drinking.   Tower has dismissed such assertions as ``rumors and innuendos.''   Set to become the nation's 17th secretary of defense, Tower hassaid he is convinced defense spending can be reined in and a strongmilitary still maintained. He has denied his previous work in theSenate and with defense contractors will prevent him from cancelingweapon programs.   _By Norman Black</TEXT><NOTE>TRANSPORTATION</NOTE><TEXT>   Samuel Knox Skinner has two roles related to his new position asGeorge Bush's transportation secretary: he's been running one of thenation's largest mass transit systems and he's an instrument-ratedpilot.   Skinner, 50, has also been U.S. attorney in Illinois and has longbeen associated with four-term Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, whois credited with helping Bush win the key state last November.   Skinner, one of a handful of Bush Cabinet members who have notheld high-profile Washington posts, directed the Bush campaign inIllinois in both 1980 and last year.   He built a reputation for toughness as top deputy to Thompsonwhen the governor was U.S. attorney and created the office's SpecialInvestigation Division, leading the prosecution of former DemocraticGov. Otto Kerner, who was convicted in 1973.   Since 1984, Skinner has been chairman of the RegionalTransportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, the nation'ssecond-largest mass transit system.   _By David Briscoe</TEXT><NOTE>LABOR</NOTE><TEXT>   Elizabeth Hanford ``Liddy'' Dole, President-elect Bush's choiceto head the Labor Department, is half of one of Washington's mostpowerful couples _ a Harvard-trained lawyer whose charm has won herbipartisan popularity in the nation's capital.   Mrs. Dole, 52, was a Democrat when she came to Washington twodecades ago, but switched to an independent and then Republican asshe climbed the ladder of success, holding several jobs in the Nixonand Ford administrations and becoming an active campaigner in thepresidential campaigns of her husband, Senate Republican leader BobDole of Kansas.   President Reagan chose her as transportation secretary in 1983.She served for four years and left with her popularity intactdespite criticism that during her tenure air and highway safetysuffered.   Organized labor had a few disputes with Mrs. Dole while she wasat transportation, but labor leaders have voiced approval of herselection, if only for the fact that they believe her politicalambitions will lead her to seek a higher profile than those who werepassed over for the job.   At the Labor Department, she will be involved in Bush's promisedplan to expand day care availability and likely will serve as theadministration's chief spokeswoman when Congress debates raising theminumum wage and in a legal fight over the government's plan to dropa ban on home work in the apparel industry.   _By John King</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
