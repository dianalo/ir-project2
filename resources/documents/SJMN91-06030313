The sale is a fund-raiser forenvironmental education.;    Native habitat;    Other plants will be used torecreate a native habitat at the refuge and other sites run by the U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service.;    The original stock, from the California ConservationCorps, has been pruned and replanted. &quot;Navlet's Nursery has given us hundredsof 1- and 5-gallon pots,&quot; Steiner said. &quot;And Nav-Land Landscape Center gave usthe equivalent of five pickup trucks of potting soil.&quot;;    Staff members andvolunteers at the refuge have been successful in germinating several speciesof plants, including 75 coast live oaks, 75 California buckeyes and about 40California bay trees. &quot;We're also trying to germinate California big leafmaples,&quot; Steiner said, &quot;but they're not cooperating.&quot;;    Right now, thenursery is in an old maintenance building, all that remains of the oldDumbarton Bridge toll booth. But officials plan to move the nursery to its ownsite this year.;    Under the direction of nursery director Bob Coates,volunteers have watered, pruned and transplanted the seedlings. Among thegreen thumb brigade are Norton Bell, Suzanne DuPont, John and Nancy Gannon,Vance Hill, Malcolm MacGregor, Jack Runyan and Joey Spooner. Eight more peopleare on the waiting list to help.;    Send money;    &quot;We don't need morevolunteers right now,&quot; Steiner said. &quot;But we do need money.&quot; Two thousanddollars would do nicely for a state-of-the-art greenhouse and wateringsystem.;    Meanwhile, if you want a testimonial to the virtues of nativeplants in your own garden, Steiner is the man to proclaim it. &quot;Native plantsare the best plants for home landscaping for a number of reasons,&quot; he said.&quot;They have evolved here with the plant predators so they have effectivedefenses against moths and beetles. They won't get defoliated or die in a coldsnap.;    &quot;And,&quot; he finished triumphantly. &quot;They are drought tolerant. Theydon't even like water in summer.&quot;; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Write a check to theSan Francisco Bay Wildlife Society, P.O.
