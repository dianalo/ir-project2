The British engineering and auto-parts company said sales fell 11.8%, to #961.2 million ($1.51 billion) from #1.09 billion, mostly a result of the spinoff of a business into a related company and the sale of another.    Net income more than tripled to #31.4 million after an extraordinary loss of #5.0 million from last month's sale of the company's U.S. heavy-duty-parts business for $18 million. A year earlier, an extraordinary loss of #25.3 million from the closure of a business reduced net to #10.3 million.    The lower pretax profit mostly reflected &quot;significant&quot; price reductions for GKN's constant-velocity drive shafts in contracts signed last year with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., according to Trevor Bonner, managing director of automotive operations. But GKN secured long-term supply arrangements with the U.S. auto makers that are expected to boost earnings in coming years, he said.    The automotive sector also was affected by nearly flat commercial vehicle sales in the United Kingdom and Europe and a further decline in the agricultural equipment market.    GKN also announced a reorganization of executive responsibilities. Sir Trevor Holdsworth, who is to retire in May 1988, will be succeeded by David Lees, the former finance director appointed group managing director in June. </TEXT></DOC>
