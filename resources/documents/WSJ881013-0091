Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> VON </CO><IN> RFD </IN><DATELINE> EL MONTE, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vons Cos., in a proxy statement, indicated that the Southern California stores it recently took over from Safeway Stores Inc. are earning a substantial operating profit this year, reversing a year-earlier loss.    Pro-forma results in a proxy statement for the supermarket operator's annual meeting show that the Safeway Southern California operations had pretax profit for the 24 weeks ended June 19 of $10.6 million, after a pretax loss of $8.2 million a year earlier. Results for Vons and the Safeway stores combined, the statement said, would show a pretax profit for the first 24 weeks of $15.4 million on combined sales of $2.23 billion.    The 172 Safeway stores in Southern California became Vons stores in August. The proxy statement said the move eliminated duplication in sales and administrative expenses and in advertising costs, resulting in savings totaling $14.5 million on an annualized basis.    Oakland, Calif.-based Safeway, which was taken private in a leveraged buy-out in 1986, continues to operate supermarkets in various areas outside Southern California.    The turnaround at the Southern California Safeway outlets early this year was better than most industry analysts had expected. &quot;Safeway's numbers were better, and we're looking for Vons' numbers to get better,&quot; said Steven DiMaggio, an analyst with the regional firm Roney andamp; Co. in Detroit. &quot;This proxy statement is a very bullish proxy statement.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Vons shares rose 25 cents to close at $10.625.    The proxy statement also showed some negatives for Vons. The acquisition of the Safeway stores raised its interest expense to $45.7 million from $28.9 million for the 24 weeks, and long-term debt rose to $779.5 million from $489.5 million. However, the leverage ratio increased only slightly, to 77.8% debt from 77.2%.    All pro-forma numbers are based on the assumption that a $35 million note held by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which took Safeway private, is converted into 4.9 million new shares of Vons stock. Vons paid the affiliate $288.5 million and 6.8 million shares to acquire the Safeway stores, giving it a 20% stake in Vons. The conversion of the note would boost KKR's stake in Vons to 30%, and the New York-based leveraged buy-out concern has the right to buy an additional 5% on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.    Vons holders will vote at the annual meeting Nov. 10 on whether to allow an early conversion of the note. The vote is required under rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of 33.3% of Vons stock have already said they intend to vote for the accelerated conversion.    Holders will also vote on a slate of directors that includes KKR's nominee, Robert MacDonnell, a general partner of the firm. Under the acquisition agreement, KKR may nominate two members to Vons board.    KKR has had a keen interest in supermarket companies in recent years. Just this week, it ended its pursuit of Kroger Co., leaving that giant Cincinnati-based food retailer free to proceed with a $4.49 billion restucturing of its own.    Vons originally was to have issued KKR 11.7 million shares in the acquisition of the Safeway stores rather than 6.8 million shares and the convertible note. But by issuing the note, Vons was able to close the acquisition in August without getting shareholder approval. That earlier closing, among other things, allowed the company to resolve &quot;uncertainties . . . arising from the initial opposition of the California attorney general,&quot; Vons said in the proxy. </TEXT></DOC>
