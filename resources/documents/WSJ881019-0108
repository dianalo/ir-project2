Nazario (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sonya Johnson lies in delivery room E of Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital here, cursing. Then she screams at the medical intern: &quot;Stop that, girl. Leave it alone, girl.&quot; The exhausted intern snaps at Ms. Johnson to shut up and push. Finally, Ms. Johnson gives birth to a baby girl.    But this is no blessed event. There is no movement; no first cry. The infant is dead -- one of 40,000 U.S. newborns this year who will never see a first birthday. Like the mothers of many of these babies, Ms. Johnson had no medical care before arriving at the hospital.    Currently, America has the worst infant-mortality record among 20 industrialized nations -- a dismaying statistic in itself. More alarming, however, is mounting evidence that many of these deaths -- perhaps half -- could be prevented through improved prenatal care among the poor, and that efforts to provide that are failing.    &quot;In inner cities and poor rural areas, the system for women to get prenatal care has broken down,&quot; declares Sarah S. Brown, an expert on infant mortality at the Institute of Medicine, part of the Washington-based National Academy of Sciences. In a two-year investigation released yesterday, the institute labels the nation's maternity care &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; and urges a government policy of free services for all pregnant mothers, following the lead of some European nations. That comes on the heels of a report to Congress by the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, also urging broad new programs for prenatal care.    Triggering much of this concern is an unexpected slowdown in the normal steady decline in infant deaths in the first year after birth. In the first half of the 1980s, figures from the congressional study indicate, the average national rate of improvement slowed to a scant 2.7% a year after averaging 4.5% a year over the preceding decade. In some areas with concentrations of poor patients, the mortality rate is actually rising.    For many years, success in reducing infant deaths came fairly routinely through improved sanitation, nutrition and medical technology. Now, the potential of these methods has just about been exhausted. Future gains will have to come from better prenatal care, doctors and experts say.    Unfortunately, even as it becomes more crucial, the use of such care is deteriorating. The new NAS study shows that the percentage of pregnant women with late care or no care rose to 5.7% in 1985 from 5.2% in 1981.    In many urban areas, the situation is acute. At New York's Kings County Hospital, 15 of every 1,000 children born die in the first 28 days of life, largely because so many mothers show up to deliver with no advance care. Nearly a third of maternity patients arriving at Chicago's Cook County Hospital haven't had prenatal care. Inadequate education about the need for care and financial barriers are to blame.    Here at the gray concrete Los Angeles County facility where Ms. Johnson gave birth, infant mortality has been on a grim and steady climb to 17.4 babies per 1,000 births from 12 in 1983. Fetal deaths are so common that the labor and delivery unit harbors an isolated room -- No. 3 -- to keep grieving would-be mothers from hearing joyous parents nearby.    &quot;We're going backwards from what's already a primitive state,&quot; says one nurse in the neonatal intensive-care unit, rushing between incubators, many holding newborns barely surviving with malfunctioning and malformed bodies.    Time spent at King General -- a 404-bed hospital built after the 1965 Watts riots in this heavily poor black and Hispanic area -- offers discouraging insights into the forces thwarting delivery of proper prenatal services to the poor. The picture is doubly ironic in view of the increased attention many middle-class couples pay to childbirth now, and the technological miracles that today allow parents to raise healthy children where their babies once would have been lost.    Here, 30% of pregnant patients arrive with no previous care, three times the 1981 rate. Hospital resident physician Margaret Juarez tells of one woman arriving nine-months pregnant for her first visit to the hospital obstetrics clinic. Her baby's heart was barely beating and the mother was suffering from severe hypertension that pregnancy can produce. She was rushed to surgery, but her child, was suffocating from an overload of bodily fluids and lived only a week.    &quot;It was a complete disaster,&quot; says Dr. Juarez, who says medication, bed rest and induced labor could have made all the difference. There are a host of barriers that can interfere with that happening.    &quot;I hate doctors,&quot; says Janice Jones, trying to explain why she avoided care in four of her seven pregnancies. &quot;Most of the time, all they do is stick needles in you and take blood.&quot; An intravenous tube in her arm, she's wiping streaks of tears from her cheeks. Her baby, born that morning, was so premature that it weighed less than a pound. It lived 30 minutes. She had been having problems, including bleeding, over the last week, but paid a friend $3 to drive her to the hospital only when the pain became excruciating.    Sonya Johnson has a similar outlook. &quot;I don't like doctors picking and poking at me,&quot; she says after her ill-fated delivery. &quot;I don't think it's too necessary. They didn't do it when my mother was having kids. I have three kids at home; I never went to a doctor for them and they came out fine.&quot;    Instead of medical care, she relied on wish fulfillment. &quot;I had someone buy the crib, the basket, the playpen,&quot; she says, her tone turning somber. &quot;I kept hoping she'd be born alive.&quot;    But there is more behind the lack of prenatal care among the poor than a distaste for doctors. &quot;You could put prenatal care on every street corner in Watts, make it free, and not get every pregnant woman to come in,&quot; says King General developmental psychologist Kathy Sanders-Phillips. Some women have powerful reasons for staying away. In Watts, cocaine use is high, and addicts fear detection may cause the government to take away a newborn. Also, for some survival upstages caring for a baby in the womb.    On a return visit to the hospital, Adrienne Robinson tells of how, three months pregnant, she began living alone in an abandoned car after her cocaine-smoking boyfriend beat her with a baseball bat, whipped her with an extension cord, and tried to move in another woman-friend.    Ms. Robinson saw doctors once, after contracting pneumonia, then moved into a motel with another homeless woman, who hallucinated, beat her and traded Ms. Robinson's federal pregnancy-related milk and food supplies for cocaine. Ms. Robinson ate potato chips and smoked cocaine. &quot;I knew I was killing my baby, but I couldn't stop,&quot; she says, rocking Christian, born with syphilis and cocaine addiction.    Some pregnant women here do seek prenatal care, eat fairly well, and avoid smoking or using drugs. A strong family structure helps some. And often, &quot;the woman's role and perception of herself is tied up with fertility and giving birth,&quot; says hospital social worker Edith Robinson.    Still, wanting care and getting it are different matters. &quot;Prenatal care is more difficult to obtain today than it was in 1975,&quot; claims Ezra Davidson, chairman of the King General obstetrics department. Los Angeles County used to have more care clinics, and visits were free, he says. Now, King General charges $25 a visit and $800 for delivery.    About 17% of American women of childbearing age don't have health insurance, according to one health-research group. Fewer than half of women under the federal poverty line now qualify for federal Medicaid assistance, compared with nearly three-quarters in 1975. And more than a third of obstetricians won't take Medicaid patients because of mounting malpractice suits, low reimbursement rates and applications up to 54 pages long, another report says.    Some communities try to identify obviously pregnant women in need of prenatal care and to pull them into clinics. Typical is the Washington, D.C., Better Babies Project, begun in 1986, where eight caseworkers scour the streets for candidates. But after reviewing 31 such programs, the Institute of Medicine concludes most efforts are &quot;naive and wasteful&quot; because the care system itself functions so poorly.    A visit to King General's drab, crowded prenatal care waiting room quickly reveals that. A woman may wait -- if lucky in a plastic chair, otherwise standing -- most of the day to see a nurse or doctor. Men who accompany them sit on hallway floors, and children run about. Periodically, a nurse emerges from one of eight examining rooms to bellow out the name of the next patient. &quot;It's not like the private sector where people are smiling and caring. We aren't user-friendly,&quot; says Dr. Davidson.    Angelina Marquez is in one of the exam rooms on her first visit. &quot;The nurses here are very busy, you know,&quot; she says; then suggests some are downright surly. It has taken an entire morning to get this far. She's in her eighth month.    Arnita Williams says she avoided visits here because of the unfriendly system, and never made two scheduled appointments at a Los Angeles public clinic when she was six months pregnant because she felt too ill to pack herself and four kids onto a bus. She got no prenatal care, and was rushed in four months ago to have her baby born prematurely at four pounds and without fully developed lungs.    Here now for a follow-up visit, she adjusts the oxygen intake that runs from the shiny chrome portable tank into nose tubes that supply Curtiss, the wide-eyed baby in her arms. &quot;They tried to take her off the oxygen, but she turned blue,&quot; she says. &quot;She has a 50-50 chance. The doctors tell me not to get my hopes up too high.&quot;    Cheryl Cromwell, who two years ago lost an infant to intestinal pneumonia, says she went to a King General-affiliated health clinic for a more recent pregnancy at two months. She says she was told she had to miss two menstrual periods before she could have a pregnancy test. When she returned at three months and tested positive, she asked to see an abortion counselor -- but a meeting couldn't be scheduled until her fifth month, by which time it was too late to abort.    Anemic and sick, she pleaded for an emergency exam ahead of her next scheduled visit. &quot;I kept going in to see the doctor because my abdomen hurt,&quot; she says, but wasn't allowed to see one. By the time of her scheduled appointment, she had already delivered a three-pound boy at 29 weeks -- premature due to a yeast infection. &quot;We don't get treated like we were spending money,&quot; she says angrily, cradling a frail baby Deon in her muscular arms in a packed King General postnatal waiting room.    Chierry Poyotte, medical director of the affiliated Watts Health Foundation clinic where Ms. Cromwell first went, says he doesn't understand what happened, because the unit has walk-in doctor services to which Ms. Cromwell should have been able to have access.    Problems don't end with arrival at the hospital for birth, either. Labor and delivery rooms are often jammed; newborns may be lined up on a makeshift stretcher for lack of nursery space. The hospital has one fully operational ultrasound machine, the basic fetal monitoring device.    At the newborn intensive care unit, licensed for 10 but holding 20, heart monitors are rotated from babies not fully stabilized to more pressing cases. Instead of the needed one nurse to one infant ratio, each nurse minds three.    Marta Hernandez, a physician at the hospital, recalls one woman arriving at the obstetrics clinic in the morning being referred to the labor and delivery unit because the clinic was short-staffed. The woman, attended by Dr. Hernandez, was repeatedly bumped for what seemed to be more urgent cases until late at night, when it was too late for procedures to inhibit labor. The woman delivered a two-pound, three-ounce baby that died 24 hours later, Dr. Hernandez says.    Even if doctors examine a woman as soon as she comes in, they often have no time to tell if her fetus is sufficiently developed or if a Caesarean section is crucial. Says Dr. Juarez: &quot;It's not unusual for a woman to go into the operating room five minutes after coming in off the street. We don't even know her name.&quot;    Doctors are frustrated because they see daily how quick, inexpensive treatment at the right time would not only save money, but untold human misery. In a recent case, they figure a $20 penicillin shot would have wiped out the syphilis that led to a patient giving birth to a baby with cataracts, liver and heart problems, and a disease called rickets, which results in bent bones. Medical bills mounted to more than $70,000 during the month that doctors fought to save the desperately ill infant in the hospital's intensive care unit. The baby's short life ended without it ever leaving the room.    ---                    Infant Mortality Rates   Infant deaths per thousand births in 20 industrialized countries*   United States .................................... 10.4   Austria ..........................................  9.9   Australia ........................................  9.8   Belgium ..........................................  9.7   German Democratic Republic .......................  9.2   United Kingdom ...................................  9.1   Ireland ..........................................  8.7   Federal Republic of Germany ......................  8.6   Spain ............................................  8.5   Norway ...........................................  8.5   Denmark ..........................................  8.2   Canada ...........................................  7.9   France ...........................................  7.6   Netherlands ......................................  7.6   Hong Kong ........................................  7.5   Singapore ........................................  7.4   Switzerland ......................................  6.8   Finland ..........................................  6.3   Sweden ...........................................  5.7   Japan ............................................  5.2 -   *Babies who die before one year of age.
