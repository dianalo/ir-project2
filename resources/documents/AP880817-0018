During eight years in the Senate, the Indiana Republican pickedas George Bush's vice presidential nominee has consistently urgedthe speediest possible development of Star Wars and has used hispost on the Armed Services Committee to argue that allied defensesneed to be beefed up in Europe to meet the Soviet threat.   Quayle is also a member of the Labor and Human ResourcesCommittee, where he has spearheaded the Reagan administration'sfight against providing advance notice of plant closings, raisingthe minimum wage, and other legislation backed by organized labor.   Quayle's counterpart on the Democratic presidential ticket, Sen.Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was an active proponent of the plantclosing law which requires 60-day notices by any employer with atleast 100 fulltime workers if a plant closing will result in lossof jobs for 50 or more employees.   Bentsen lost no time in offering to renew that debate. At arally in Fort Worth, Texas, hours after Bush chose Quayle, Bentsensaid, ``I'm really looking forward to that one. ...Dan Quayle andthe administration lost that debate and the American working manand woman won it.''   On July 9, Quayle argued that the mandatory notices required bythe bill were nothing more than an attempt by unions to ``allow thegovernment to assert itself in the collective bargaining process.''   But Quayle is best known in the Senate as an expert on defenseissues, a reputation earned through hours spent learning theshadings of such national security topics as Soviet militarydoctrine, weapons performance, and the impact of international lawon arms control treaties.   Quayle is the ranking Republican on the conventional force andallied defense subcommittee, which chiefly deals with the 16-memberNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Quayle's conservative views were most visible during two majornational security battles in the Senate this year _ over theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) pact and the Pentagonbudget.   Even though the INF treaty, which requires the elimination ofboth U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles from Europe, wasnegotiated by a conservative Republican administration, Quayle wasoriginally skeptical.   During weeks of hearings on the pact's effect on NATO'ssecurity, Quayle was one of the few senators who sat throughvirtually all of the hearings.   Quayle questioned if the pact might inhibit deployment of theStrategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known, anddemanded that the question be answered before the Senateratification vote. Ultimately, he joined the 93-5 majority whichratified the treaty.   Last month, when the Democratic-controlled Congress was decidingwhether to approve a Pentagon budget, Quayle said Reagan shouldveto the bill because it cut too deeply into the Star Wars budget.It was advice Reagan followed, even though more moderateRepublicans, such as Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Reagan shouldsign the bill, because it was the best deal the administration waslikely to get.   Reagan wanted $4.8 billion next year for Star Wars, but thecompromise measure which emerged from Congress provided $4.0billion.   As the Senate was preparing July 14 for final passage of thebill, Quayle moved to have it returned to a House-Senate conferencecommittee to increase the Star Wars budget and strip outDemocratic-written arms control restrictions.   ``This is a political struggle between the administration andthe Congress over who is going to run arms control policy, noquestion about it,'' Quayle explained.   Quayle's move lost, 58-35, and he was one of the firstlegislators to praise Reagan when the president vetoed the billAug. 3. Quayle termed the veto ``a good, sound decision.''   On the Labor Committee, Quayle and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,have been the strongest administration supporters.   But even when Hatch, the White House and major business groupsdropped their opposition to some measures _ such as a ban on theuse of lie detectors to screen job applicants _ Quayle remained avehement foe.   Last March, when the Senate passed the polygraph ban that waslater signed into law by Reagan, Quayle complained the White Househad ``caved like a house of cards.'' He said, ``The administrationdoes not have the backbone at this time to veto this bill...Theyhave folded up shop.''   Quayle was also involved the bitter 1986 Senate fight overDaniel Manion, a conservative Indiana lawyer whose judicialnomination became a battleground over Reagan's judicialphilosophies.   Manion had been appointed by Reagan to a federal appeals courtpost in Chicago. Opponents said Manion was unqualified, butRepublicans said he was being criticized only because of hisconservative ideology.   Manion, a son of the founder of the John Birch Society, hadreceived a ``qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association,the lowest passing grade given by the ABA's judicial screeningpanel.   Manion was eventually confirmed, 50-49, on a tie-breaking votecast by Bush in his vice-presidential role as presiding officer ofthe Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
