Simple models-the one dimensional box-model- and those incorporating oceanic mixingprocesses are not satisfactory. Most models calibrated with a singleoceanic tracer do not reproduce the distribution of other tracers well,and so multibox, geographically realistic models, using a range of tracershave been developed. Atmospherically driven models will eventually helpto assess how future climatic change may feed back on atmospheric carbondioxide levels. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
