Persian Gulf heavyweights, who dominate policy-makingwithin the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, sofar have averted a price war, but have recently been cuttingtheir third-quarter contract prices in an effort to protecttheir market shares. Price reductions by Saudi Arabia oncrude for delivery during July were quickly followed bysimilar moves from Iran. Kuwait, which just completed itsnegotiations for July, has undercut Saudi pricing slightly oncertain types of crude, oil experts said.</LP><TEXT>   Even before those moves, oil prices had declined by morethan $8 a barrel since the beginning of the year, reflectingmushrooming global stocks, which have risen by as much as 250million barrels. Not since the end of 1982 has so much oilbeen on hand. Terminals in Europe and the Caribbean, acrucial storage area for U.S. markets, are mostly full. Morethan half of the oil tankers currently under charter arebeing used for storage rather than shipping.   Despite the glut, futures prices of oil traded at the NewYork Mercantile Exchange rose on talk by Saddam Hussein ofIraq of the potential for war in the Middle East. Inaddition, the threat of a strike in the Norwegian North Seaoil fields as early as Monday has made some sellers morereluctant. &quot;If a strike materializes, it could bolsterprices,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, president of PetroleumIndustry Research Foundation.   But these worries don't eliminate the hard fact that thereis a huge surplus of crude in the market, experts say. And asprices for some lesser grades of crude have slipped below $15a barrel, OPEC strategists have wondered whether they areabout to see a rerun of the 1986 price collapse. While a boonfor some oil consumers, that plunge rocked the oil industryand played havoc with some national and regional economies aswell as with the banks that underwrote billions of dollars ofoil-collateralized debt.   Oil ministers from OPEC's Persian Gulf nations areexpected to gather some time next month in Taif, SaudiArabia, to begin working on a strategy that would head offany similar price decline. The meeting would be in advance ofOPEC's full ministerial meeting on July 25 in Geneva, whichwould be attended by all members.   Meantime, OPEC's acting president Sadek Boussena has beenon a whirlwind tour of Persian Gulf oil producers, trying tofind a way to reduce output and prop up prices. Some OPECmembers are also jawboning Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates, the cartel's two notorious overproducers, whichhave almost single-handedly caused this year's price decline.   Kuwait's new oil minister, Rashid Salem Al-Omari, met withSaudi minister Hisham Nazer to discuss the oversupplyproblem. And during the last month, Iraq has attempted topressure Kuwait into reducing output through editorials inIraqi newspapers. Iraq accuses Kuwait of purposelyoverproducing to keep oil prices low, which in turn woulddeny Iraq the revenue it needs to rebuild its war-torneconomy -- and its already-feared military machine.   In the latest step in Iraq's campaign, President Husseinrecently sent his deputy oil minister to Kuwait with amessage warning the sheikdom to restrain output because itwas harming Iraq and other OPEC producers by exceeding itsOPEC-assigned quota.   Even as OPEC members haggle among themselves in efforts tostrike yet another production-limiting bargain, thecredibility of any agreement that might be reached is undersuspicion. &quot;We now factor OPEC cheating into all of ourshort-term pricing forecasts,&quot; claims William Hermann, chiefeconomist for Chevron Corp.   By not adhering to the daily output ceiling of 22 millionbarrels it agreed upon in April, OPEC flooded the market withcrude during the weakest demand period of the year. OPECoutput since April has ballooned at times as high as 23.9million barrels a day, according to some estimates. Dailyproduction during June has eased back to between 23 millionand 23.2 million barrels.   But OPEC is going to have to pump a lot less crude thanthat if it expects to return oil prices to the $18-a-barrellevel it has been aiming for. Estimates currently put theprice for the OPEC basket of crudes at less than $13.75 abarrel.   Until yesterday, even the strike threatened for early nextweek in the North Sea hadn't provided any psychologicalstrength to the market, although it is already shy of NorthSea barrels. Because of maintenance programs, only 18 cargoesof North Sea Brent are available for purchase during July,down from 32 in April. A strike in Norway's North Sea fieldswould cut off 1.6 million barrels of daily production. Theshortfall of North Sea crude has failed to prop up prices,says Peter Gignoux, who runs the energy desk for ShearsonLehman Hutton in London.   If OPEC can reduce its production to below 23 millionbarrels a day, prices should begin to strengthen as winterdemand for oil starts to materialize. Demand for OPEC crudeduring the third quarter is pegged by industry analysts atabout 22.5 million barrels a day, rising during the fourthquarter to 23 million.   Market participants say they aren't going to settle formere OPEC rhetoric this time. They want to see action. &quot;Atthe April meeting, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia said they wouldcut back and the market bought it,&quot; said Ed Krapels of EnergySecurity Analysis Inc. &quot;But then the truth came out -- onlythe Saudis cut. Sheik Ali (former Kuwait oil minister) didn'tabide by the agreement. OPEC isn't going to be able to talkthis market up again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
