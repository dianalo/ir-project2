Frank got a job with Candamp;O Railroad as a laborer, working seven days a week. Patience made soup-and-sandwich lunches for sale and took in laundry from white families. Together, they eventually bought a small house and over the years raised and educated many children.    In 1971, Scott C. Davis arrived in Fulton as a volunteer with VISTA, the domestic Peace Corps. Patience Gromes was 83 by then, a widow who let the extra bedroom upstairs to Mr. Davis. Now, 17 years later, Mr. Davis has written a book prompted by his two years in Fulton, &quot;The World of Patience Gromes: Making and Unmaking a Black Community&quot; (University Press of Kentucky, 222 pages, $20).    &quot;I want to tell the story of a black community,&quot; Mr. Davis begins. &quot;Its birth in the country at the end of the Civil War, its move from country to city, its disintegration during the War on Poverty.&quot;    And later: &quot;I want to tell about men and women such as Patience Gromes who possessed an idea of grace through history, an idea for want of which a culture is broken, scattered and unable to find its way.&quot; The result is a small but important gem of a book.    First, a few things that &quot;Patience Gromes&quot; is not. It is not a sociological treatise -- doesn't pretend to be, doesn't want to be. Mr. Davis is a storyteller, and as far as an outsider can tell, a careful and well-informed one. It is not a tract.    Mr. Davis openly has a bone to pick with urban renewal, but this hardly seems a prejudice on his part: Urban renewal did in fact come into Fulton and systematically destroyed the old neighborhood, and there wasn't anything subtle about it. Mr. Davis has a quarrel with urban renewal, but other than that his description of what happened in Fulton is not an anti-War-on-Poverty screed. On the contrary, he provides ammunition for various sides in the debate over how the contemporary black inner-city came to be.    Clearly, judging from Mr. Davis's account, the reforms of the 1960s created or exacerbated a number of problems. Just as clearly, some other problems began emerging earlier than that, back in the '40s and '50s.    Mr. Davis doesn't push an overarching explanation for any of it. &quot;Patience Gromes&quot; is, as advertised, the story of a community over a long period of time, with all sorts of loose ends that can be described more easily than explained.    Much of the value of Mr. Davis's book lies in the recounting of the earlier decades of Fulton, the bad old days when everything -- including state-enforced racism -- was stacked against the blacks of Fulton. Mr. Davis does not blink at describing the ways in which they truly were the bad old days, but he also manages to describe the vitality and satisfactions to be found in the life of the community.    In describing both the miseries and the satisfactions, &quot;Patience Gromes&quot; is rich in detail and characterization. The account gives continual evidence of the kind of interview material that comes only after many patient, drifting conversations. Without ever saying so, Mr. Davis also conveys that Fulton in the first decades of the century was a quintessentially American town, a community that both the early Irish immigrants to Boston and the early Chinese immigrants to San Francisco would recognize.    The old Fulton was black in a few particularities (as South Boston remained distinctively Irish), but American in its essence.    By lingering over his description of the old Fulton, Mr. Davis also manages to highlight a point missed in many contemporary discussions of poor urban black communities. &quot;Patience Gromes&quot; reminds us that, intractable as some of the problems of the inner-city may be, it wasn't always this way. Once upon a time, black people -- desperately poor, ill-educated, discriminated-against blacks -- knew how to form communities that worked. If once, why not again?    The flaws of &quot;Patience Gromes&quot; are minor -- mainly an organizational structure that jumps around too much. Its virtues are vivid characters, a fascinating story and a transparently clear and often moving prose style. &quot;Patience Gromes&quot; is an easy and at the same time a deeply enjoyable read. Without seeming to try, it also contributes as much to our understanding of the origins of the modern black inner-city as any book written in this decade.    ---   Mr. Murray is a Bradley Fellow at the Manhattan Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
