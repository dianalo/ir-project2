Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) met privately for an hour yesterday with House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) to discuss possible ways to raise revenue, including the speaker's recent proposal to impose a &quot;transfer tax&quot; of perhaps 0.5% on both the buyer and the seller of publicly traded stock. In an interview after the meeting, Rep. Rostenkowski said, &quot;I've got my staff looking at it.&quot;    Rep. Rostenkowski was cool, however, on another of Rep. Wright's revenue-raising proposals: to freeze the top individual tax rate at 38.5% rather than allowing it to fall to 28% next year, as scheduled under the new tax law. &quot;Naturally I would prefer to leave the rate structure alone,&quot; the House's chief tax-writer said.    The powerful committee chairman said he isn't ready to commit himself to any tax-boost proposal. But his willingness to consider the transfer tax, combined with the push from the speaker and the view of many in Congress that Wall Street is a ready target because of insider-trading scandals, will put the proposal near the top of the list if Congress decides to raise taxes.    The speaker and Ways and Means chairman agreed that people with higher incomes should bear a greater share of any new tax. &quot;We ought to get that element enjoying the good life to pay for it,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said.    On any tax legislation, Rep. Rostenkowski repeated his intention of wanting support from President Reagan first. &quot;I find it very hard to ask my committee to raise revenues unless we get some support from the White House.&quot;    Separately, Rep. Rostenkowski took a tough yet conciliatory posture yesterday in a speech on the trade legislation he expects to steer through his committee this month. He said he wouldn't &quot;oppose reasonable modifications&quot; to the controversial provision in the House trade bill that would require foreign countries having a trade surplus with the U.S. to eliminate their barriers to U.S. exports.    Rep. Rostenkowski said in the interview that he &quot;originally thought&quot; a stock-transfer tax could drive securities transactions overseas. &quot;Certainly I have received calls from my friends in New York,&quot; he noted, since Speaker Wright floated the idea.    But he said his staff now is determining &quot;what the dollars are&quot; if a transfer tax were imposed. Rep. Wright has said that one version could raise about $17 billion a year.    Mr. Rostenkowski said he told Rep. Wright that &quot;there's nobody who should feel comfortable at this time if we're going to need some $30 billion in revenue.&quot;    In his speech before the National Press Club, Rep. Rostenkowski agreed with several congressional Democrats who say it isn't necessary to abide strictly by the Gramm-Rudman law's deficit target of $108 billion for fiscal 1988.    &quot;I believe that real deficit reduction in the range of $36 billion would keep faith with Gramm-Rudman,&quot; the Illinois Democrat said. &quot;In fact, I prefer doing that rather than faking a reduction of $60 billion just to say we met the Gramm-Rudman target.&quot; The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a cut of about $60 billion will be necessary to meet the target.    On trade legislation, Rep. Rostenkowski said he would agree to some modification of the controversial plan to lift trade barriers, first advanced by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), as long as it achieves its goal of asking &quot;the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market.&quot;    Rep. Rostenkowski said the Ways and Means bill will strengthen the office of the U.S. trade representative &quot;by transferring to him many powers now scattered throughout the federal bureaucracy.&quot; He said the current system where responsibility for trade is divided among several agencies &quot;simply doesn't work.&quot;    The Ways and Means chairman said he wanted to write a trade bill acceptable to the Reagan administration and called for bipartisan cooperation on the sweeping trade legislation. &quot;I'm not trying to write legislation to please (AFL-CIO President) Lane Kirkland, but legislation that will be signed by the president and be fair and give us access to foreign markets,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said.    Perhaps to counter some concern that the House might produce a measure that would be protectionist and inhibit trade, Rep. Rostenkowski said, &quot;Our goal should be expanding world trade, not shrinking international commerce.&quot;    The congressman also said he was opposed to adding provisions to help certain import-battered domestic industries. &quot;We're going to have a generic bill,&quot; he said. &quot;To go after individual trade problems is suicide.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
