These amendments conformthe regulations to changes made to section 907 by section 211 (96 Stat.448) of TEFRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Temporary Regulations</ITAG>The proper application of changes made to section 907 by TEFRA is dependentupon the Internal Revenue Service's detailed specifications of the mannerin which those changes will be administered. These regulations are necessaryto provide taxpayers with immediate guidance with regard to their taxableyears that remain open under the statute of limitations. Therefore, goodcause is found to dispense with the notice and public procedure requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and the delayed effective date requirement of 5 U.S.C.553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>The amount allowed as a foreign tax credit under section 901 for foreigntaxes paid with respect to foreign oil and gas extraction income (FOGEI)is limited by section 907(a). The amount of the foreign tax credit cannotexceed the amount of FOGEI multiplied by, in the case of a corporation,the highest corporate tax rate or, in the case of an individual, the individual'saverage tax rate.Changes Made by TEFRA Since enactment of section 907 by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, in computingthe FOGEI limitation of section 907(a), pre-TEFRA section 907(c)(4) providedthat net operating losses relating to extraction of minerals from oil orgas wells arising in one foreign country did not offset FOGEI arising inother foreign countries. This per-country loss rule was repealed by TEFRA;thus, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, FOGEI and foreignoil extraction losses from all foreign countries are aggregated beforecomputing the limitation of section 907(a). Section 907(c)(4), amendedby TEFRA, provides for the recapture of overall foreign oil extractionlosses for years preceding the limitation year, but beginning after December31, 1982, against limitation year FOGEI before application of section 907(a).Foreign taxes in excess of the section 907(a) limitation, under section907(f), as amended by TEFRA, may be carried back for two years and forwardfor five years. Under old section 907(f), the carryback-carryover tax amountcould not exceed 2% of FOGEI for the limitation year. This 2% limitationwas eliminated by TEFRA. Prior to TEFRA, after section 907(a) limited creditable FOGEI taxes toa certain percentage of FOGEI, the creditability of those taxes, togetherwith taxes on foreign oil related income (FORI), were subject to the furtherlimitation of pre-TEFRA section 907(b). That section provided that thesection 904 limitation on foreign tax credits would be applied separatelywith respect to FORI, which prior to TEFRA included FOGEI. This separateapplication of the section 904 limitation for FORI was repealed by section211 of TEFRA for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. New section 907(b) was added by TEFRA in order to neutralize the consequenceof the shifting by some foreign countries of the tax burden from taxeson FOGEI, creditability of which would be limited by section 907(a), totaxes on FORI. New section 907(b) limits creditable FORI taxes, which donot include FOGEI taxes, to the amount that would have been imposed bythe foreign country on income that is neither FORI nor FOGEI if, underforeign law, FORI taxes in excess of this limitation were treated as adeductible expense. For United States tax purposes, FORI taxes in excessof the section 907(b) limitation are deductible as business expenses. New section 907(e), as added by TEFRA, provides transitional rules applicableto unused taxes carried from a year beginning before January 1, 1983, toa year beginning after December 31, 1982 (the effective date of the TEFRAchanges), and to unused taxes carried back from a year beginning afterDecember 31, 1982, to a year beginning before January 1, 1983. Section 212 of TEFRA added certain foreign base company oil related incomeas an additional item to the category of foreign base company income underthe subpart F provisions of sections 951 through 964. See section 954 (a)(5)and (g)(1). These regulations define this FORI for purposes of section954 (a)(5) and (g)(1).Section 907 Regulations The regulations under section 907 consist of two sets: the set of regulationsproposed by this notice dealing with taxable years beginning after December31, 1982, and the set published as T.D. 7961 (49 FR 26208) dealing withtaxable years beginning before January 1, 1983 (1984 Treasury Decision).This latter set of regulations was supplemented by T.D. 8160 (52 FR 33930)published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 9, 1987 (1987 Treasury Decision)which contained definitions of interest on working capital, exchange gainor loss, directly related services and lease or license of related property.Many of the provisions of the regulations contained in these temporaryregulations are substantially similar to provisions of the regulationscontained in the 1984 and 1987 Treasury Decisions because they deal withprovisions in section 907 that were not affected by TEFRA. Thus, andSection;andSection;1.907(c)-1T, 1.907(c)-2T, and 1.907(c)-3T are very similar to andSection;andSection;1.907(c)-1A, 1.907(c)-2A and 1.907(c)-3A, respectively, and andSection; 1.907(d)-1Tis virtually identical to andSection; 1.907(d)-1A. The treatment by the temporaryregulations of two matters, the carryover of foreign oil extraction lossesand the new limitation on FORI taxes in section 907(b), are explained belowin more detail.Carryover of Foreign Oil Extraction Losses New section 907(c)(4) requires that a foreign oil extraction loss incurredin one year be carried over and offset against FOGEI of a later year. Thisrule operates only for purposes of determining FOGEI under section 907(a)and thus operates independently of the rule of section 904(f) dealing withoverall foreign losses. Taxes imposed on FOGEI retain their character asFOGEI taxes even though FOGEI is reduced by a loss carryover. Therefore,they may be carried back and forward to other taxable years under section907(f).Limitation on FORI Taxes Section 907(b), as amended, places a limitation on the amount of creditableFORI tax if the FORI tax is excessive. In andSection; 1.907(b)-1T(a), thetemporary regulations provide that non-dual capacity taxpayers and dualcapacity taxpayers that use the facts and circumstances method of andSection;1.901-2A(c)(2) to determine their creditable taxes and specific economicbenefits must apply the safe harbor formula of andSection; 1.901-2A(e)(1)to the FORI tax payments made to the foreign country to determine the amountof FORI tax that is creditable under section 907(b). Section 907(b) doesnot apply, however, if the safe harbor formula has already been appliedto the tax paid by a dual capacity taxpayer under section 901. These temporaryregulations provide examples showing the interaction of sections 901 and907(b).Treatment of Income from Sale of Stock In light of the Supreme Court decision in <T3>Arkansas Best </T3>v. <T3>Commissioner</T3>, 108 S. Ct. 971 (1988), the temporary regulationsprovide that for both pre-TEFRA and post-TEFRA years, stock of any corporationwill not be treated as an asset used by a person in section 907(c) activities.Therefore, income (or loss) from the sale of stock will never be FOGEIor FORI.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>It has been determined that these rules are not major rules as definedin Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is notrequired. A general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required by 5U.S.C. 553 for temporary regulations. Therefore, these rules do not constituteregulations subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Chapter6) and a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Richard L.

However, taxes that were paid or accruedon the recharacterized FOGEI will remain FOGEI taxes. (ii) Taxes paid or accrued by a person to a foreign country may be FOGEItaxes even though that person has under U.S. law a net operating loss fromsources within that country. (iii) For purposes of determining whether income is FOGEI, a taxpayer'sincome will be treated as income from sources outside the United Stateseven though all or a portion of that income may be resourced as incomefrom sources with the United States under section 904(f)(1) and (4).

Section 907(b) will apply to a person regardless of whetherthat person is a dual capacity taxpayer as defined in andSection; 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A).(In general, a dual capacity taxpayer is a person who pays an amount toa foreign country part of which is attributable to an income tax and theremainder of which is a payment for a specific economic benefit derivedfrom that country.) Foreign law imposing a tax on FORI will be consideredeither to be structured in or to operate in the described manner if anyof the tax imposed on FORI is considered not be an income, war profitsor excess profits tax under paragraph (b) of this section.

However, if the dual capacity taxpayerhas used the facts and circumstances method of andSection; 1.901-2A(c)(2)to establish the portion of the FORI tax that is a payment of tax ratherthan a payment for a specific economic benefit, the safe harbor formulaof andSection; 1.901-2A(e) will be applied to the portion of the paymentdetermined to be a tax under the facts and circumstances method to determinewhether section 907(b) will further reduce that amount. (2) <T3>Non-dual capacity taxpayer.</T3> With regard to non-dual capacity taxpayers,the portion of the FORI tax that is considered an income, war profits,or excess profits tax is determined by applying the safe harbor formulaof andSection; 1.901-2A(e) with respect to the person's foreign oil relatedincome (as determined under foreign law pursuant to the provisions of paragraph(e)(2) of that section).

(d) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of this section may be illustrated bythe following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1)</T3>_(i) <T3>Facts.</T3> X, a U.S. corporation that uses the accrual method of accountingand the calendar year as its taxable year, extracts oil in foreign countryFC, transports it via pipeline to a refinery located in FC, and sells itto Y, an unrelated corporation that operates the refinery. X is a dualcapacity taxpayer as defined in andSection; 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A). The onlyincome X has that is taxed by FC is its income from the sale of oil toY. FC imposes a generally applicable tax at the rate of 45% on the netincome derived by foreign corporations from a trade or business carriedon in FC. That tax is an income tax within the meaning of section 901.Taxable FOGEI and taxable FORI are determined under foreign law which,for purposes of this example, is assumed to be the same as United Stateslaw.

Y is not receiving a specific economic benefit fromFC. Since andSection; 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(E), relating to the indirect receiptof a specific economic benefit, does not apply to Y, Y is not a dual capacitytaxpayer with respect to FC. The only income Y has that is taxed by FCis its income from the sale of refined oil. All of this income is FORIas defined in section 907(c)(2)(A). Y is subject to the generally applicabletax mentioned in <T3>Example</T3> (1) except that Y is subject to a 50%, rather than a 45%,rate.

See also andSection; 1.907(a)-oT (b) for further definitions. (b) <T3>FOGEI</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule.</T3> Under section 907(c)(1), FOGEI means taxable income(or loss) derived from sources outside the United States and its possessionsfrom the extraction (by the taxpayer or any other person) of minerals fromoil or gas wells located outside the United States and its possessionsor from the sale or exchange of assets used by the taxpayer in extractionof those minerals. Extraction of minerals from oil or gas wells will resultin gross income from extraction in every case in which that person hasan economic interest in the minerals in place. For other circumstancesin which gross income from extraction may arise, see paragraph (b)(3) ofthis section. For determination of the amount of gross income from extraction,see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For definition of the phrase ``assetsused by the taxpayer in the trade or business'' and for rules relatingto that type of FOGEI, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The term ``minerals''is defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For determination of taxableincome, see paragraph (f)(2) of this section. FOGEI includes, in addition,items listed in section 907(c)(3) (relating to dividends, interest, partnershipdistributions, etc.) and explained in andSection; 1.907(c)-2T. For the reductionof what would otherwise be FOGEI by losses incurred in a prior year, seesection 907(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section. (2) <T3>Amount.</T3> The gross income from extraction is determined by referenceto the fair market value of the minerals in the immediate vicinity of thewell. Fair market value is determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.(3) <T3>Other circumstances.</T3> Gross income from extraction or the saleor exchange of assets described in section 907(c)(1)(B) includes incomefrom any arrangement, or a combination of arrangements or transactions,to the extent the income is in substance attributable to the extractionof minerals or such a sale or exchange. For instance, a person may havegross income from such a sale or exchange if the person purchased mineralsfrom a foreign government at a discount and the discount reflects an arm's-lengthamount in consideration for the government's nationalization of assetsthat person owned and used in the extraction of minerals. (4) <T3>Income directly related to extraction.</T3> Gross income from extractionincludes directly related income under paragraph (g) of this section. (5) <T3>Income not included.</T3> FOGEI as otherwise determined under thisparagraph (b), nevertheless, does not include income to the extent attributableto marketing, distributing, processing or transporting minerals or primaryproducts. Income from the purchase and sale of minerals is not ordinarilyFOGEI. If the foreign taxes paid or accrued in connection with income froma purchase and sale are not creditable by reason of section 901(f), thatincome is not FOGEI. A taxpayer to whom section 901(f) applies is not aproducer. (6) <T3>Fair market value.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (b), the fairmarket value of oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well dependson all of the facts and circumstances as they exist relative to a partyin any particular case. The facts and circumstances that may be taken intoaccount include, but are not limited to, the following_ (i) The facts and circumstances pertaining to an independent market value(if any) in the immediate vicinity of the well, (ii) The facts and circumstances pertaining to the relationships betweenthe taxpayer and the foreign government. If an independent fair marketvalue in the immediate vicinity of the well cannot be determined but fairmarket value at the port, or a similar point, in the foreign country canbe determined (port price), an analysis of the arrangements between thetaxpayer and the foreign government that retains a share of productioncould be evidence of the appropriate, arm's-length difference between theport price and the field price, and (iii) The other facts and circumstances pertaining to any difference inthe producing country between the field and port prices. (7) <T3>Economic interest.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term``economic interest'' means an economic interest as defined in andSection;1.611-1(b)(1), whether or not a deduction for depletion is allowable undersection 611. (c) <T3>Carryover of foreign oil extraction losses</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Pursuant to section 907(c)(4), the determination ofFOGEI for a particular taxable year takes into account a foreign oil extractionloss incurred in prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.There is no time limitation on this carryover of foreign oil extractionlosses. Section 907(c)(4) does not provide for any carryback of these losses.Section 907(c)(4) operates solely for purposes of determining FOGEI andthus operates independently of section 904(f). (2) <T3>Reduction.</T3> That portion of the income of the taxpayer for thetaxable year which but for this paragraph (c) would be treated as FOGEIis reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of_(i) The aggregate amount of foreign oil extraction losses for precedingtaxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, over(ii) The aggregate amount of reductions under this paragraph (c) for precedingtaxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.(3) <T3>Foreign oil extraction loss defined</T3>_(i)<T3> In general.</T3> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``foreignoil extraction loss'' means the amount by which the gross income for thetaxable year that is taken into account in determining FOGEI for that yearis exceeded by the sum of the deductions properly allocated and apportionedto that gross income (as determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section).A person can have a foreign oil extraction loss for a taxable year evenif the person has not chosen the benefits of section 901 for that year.(ii) <T3>Items not taken into account.</T3> For purposes of subdivision (i)of this paragraph, the following items are not taken into account_(A) The net operating loss deduction allowable for the taxable year undersection 172(a),(B) Any foreign expropriation loss (as defined in section 172(h)) for thetaxable year, and(C) Any loss for the taxable year which arises from fire, storm, shipwreck,or other casualty, or from theft.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A loss mentioned in subdivision (ii) (B) or (C) of this paragraphis taken into account, however, to the extent compensation (for instanceby insurance) for the loss is included in gross income.(4) <T3>Affiliated groups.</T3> The foreign oil extraction loss of an affiliatedgroup of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a)) that filesa consolidated return is determined on a group basis. If the group doesnot have a foreign oil extraction loss, the foreign oil extraction lossof a member of that group will not reduce on a separate basis that member'sFOGEI for a later taxable year. (5) <T3>FOGEI taxes.</T3> If FOGEI is reduced pursuant to this paragraph (c)(and thereby recharacterized as non-FOGEI income), any foreign taxes imposedon the FOGEI that is recharacterized as other income retain their characteras FOGEI taxes. See section 907(c)(5).(6) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustratedby the following examples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1)</T3>_(i) <T3>Facts.</T3> X, a U.S. corporation using the accrual method of accountingand the calendar year as its taxable year, is engaged in extraction activitiesin three foreign countries.

Thus, none of the FOGEItaxes paid or accrued in 1983 ($10) can be credited in 1983. They can,however, be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2)and andSection;1.907(e)-1T and carried forward pursuant to the provisionsof section 907(f) and andSection;1.907(f)-1T.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) <T3>1984.</T3> X's FOGEI for 1984, prior to the application of this paragraph(c), is $100. X has a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 of $(500). Thisloss must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of $100 for 1984. Thus,X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0 and X has $400(500-$100) of foreign oil extractionloss from 1983 to be carried to 1985. Because X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0,its section 907(a) limitation is $0 (.46andCx.187;$0). Therefore, none ofthe FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($60) can be credited in 1984.They can, however, be carried back to 1982 pursuant to the provisions ofsection 907(e)(2) and andSection;1.907(e)-1T and carried forward pursuantto the provisions of section 907(f) and andSection;1.907(f)-1T.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) <T3>1985.</T3> X's FOGEI for 1985, prior to the application of this paragraph(c), is $450. X's remaining foreign oil extraction loss carryover from1983 is $400 and this must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of$450 for 1985. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $50 ($450^$400). X's section907(a) limitation is $23 (.46andCx.187;$50). Therefore, $23 of the FOGEItaxes paid or accrued in 1985 can be credited in 1985, subject to the generallimitation of section 904(d)(1)(E). The excess of FOGEI taxes, $177 ($200-$23),can be carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) andandSection;1.907(f)-1T.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2)</T3>_(i) <T3>Facts.</T3> The facts are the same as in <T3>Example</T3> (1) except that X's paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items for 1983allocable to FOGEI are $(800) instead of $(200). FOGEI remains a loss of$700. Thus, X does not have a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 becauseit has $100 of FOGEI when its paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items are not takeninto account ($(700)+$800).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) <T3>1983.</T3> The results are the same as in <T3>Example</T3> (1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) <T3>1984.</T3> Although X had a FOGEI loss of $(700) in 1983, there isnot a loss that can be carried forward after adjustment for paragraph (c)(3)(ii)items. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is not reduced by the 1983 loss. X's section907(a) limitation for 1984 is $46 (.46andmultiply;$100). Therefore, $46 ofthe FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 can be credited in 1984, subjectto the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E). The excess of $14 ($60-$46)can be carried back to 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2)and andSection; 1.907(e)-1T and carried forward pursuant to the provisionsof section 907(f) and andSection; 1.907(f)-1T.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) <T3>1985.</T3> Since there is no foreign oil extraction loss for either1983 or 1984 to be applied in 1985, X's FOGEI for 1985 is $450. Thus, itssection 907(a) limitation for 1985 is $207 (.46andmultiply;$450) and allof its FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985 ($200) can be credited in 1985,subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E). FOGEI taxesin the amount of $10 from 1983 and $14 from 1984 may be carried forwardto 1985 if they have not been used in carryback years.

FORI may also include,under section 907(c)(3), certain dividends, interest, or amounts describedin section 951(a). This paragraph (d) defines certain terms and items applicableto FORI.(2) <T3>Transportation. </T3>Gross income from transportation of minerals orprimary products (``gross transportation income'') is gross income arisingfrom carrying minerals or primary products between two places (includingtime or voyage charter hires) by any means of transportation, such as avessel, pipeline, truck, railroad, or aircraft. Except for directly relatedincome under paragraphs (d)(7) and (g) of this section, gross transportationincome does not include gross income received by a lessor from a bareboatcharter hire of a means of transportation, certain other rental income,or income from the performance of certain services. (3) <T3>Distribution or sale. </T3>The term ``distribution or sale'' meansthe sale or exchange of minerals or primary products to processors, userswho purchase, store, or use in bulk quantities, other persons for furtherdistribution, retailers, or consumers. Gross income from distribution orsale includes interest income attributable to the distribution of mineralsor primary products on credit.(4) <T3>Processing. </T3>The term ``processing'' means the destructive distillation,or a process similar in effect to destructive distillation, of crude oiland the processing of natural gas into their primary products includingprocesses used to remove pollutants from crude oil or natural gas.(5) <T3>Primary product from oil. </T3>The term ``primary product'' (in thecase of oil) means all products derived from the processing of crude oil,including volatile products, light oils (such as motor fuel and kerosene),distillates (such as naphtha), lubricating oils, greases and waxes, andresidues (such as fuel oil).(6) <T3>Primary product from gas. </T3>The term ``primary product'' (in thecase of gas) means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from gaswells or oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further processing,including natural gas, condensates, liquefied petroleum gases (such asethane, propane, and butane), and liquid products (such as natural gasoline).(7) <T3>Directly related income. </T3>FORI also includes directly related incomeunder paragraph (g) of this section.(e) <T3>Assets used in a trade or business_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``assets used by the taxpayer in the tradeor business'' in section 907(c) (1)(B) and (2)(D) means property primarilyused in one or more of the trades or businesses that are section 907(c)activities. For purposes of this paragraph (e), assets used in a tradeor business are assets described in section 1231(b) (applied without regardto any holding period or the character of the asset as being subject tothe allowance for depreciation under section 167).(2) <T3>Section 907(c) activities. </T3>Section 907(c) activities are thosedescribed in section 907(c)(1)(A) (for FOGEI) or (c)(2) (A) through (C)(for FORI). If an asset is used primarily in one or more section 907(c)activities, then the entire gain (or loss) will be considered attributableto those activities. For example, if a person uses a service station primarilyto distribute primary products from oil, then all of the gain (or loss)on the sale of the station is FORI even though the person uses the stationto distribute products that are not primary products (such as tires orbatteries). If an asset is not primarily used in one or more section 907(c)activities, then the entire gain or loss will not be FOGEI or FORI.(3) <T3>Stock. </T3>Stock of any corporation (whether foreign or domestic)will not be treated as an asset used by a person in section 907(c) activities.(4) <T3>Losses on sale of stock. </T3>If, under andSection;1.861-8(e)(7), a losson the sale, exchange, or disposition of stock is considered a deductionwhich is definitely related and allocable to FOGEI or FORI, then notwithstandingandSection;1.861-8 (e)(7) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this lossshall be allocated and apportioned to the same class of income that wouldhave been produced if there were capital gain from the sale, exchange ordisposition.(5) <T3>Character of gain or loss. </T3>Except in the case of stock, gain orloss from the sale, exchange or disposition of assets used in the tradeor business may be FORI or FOGEI to the extent taken into account in computingtaxable income for the taxable year, whether or not the gain or loss isordinary income or ordinary loss. (6) <T3>Allocation of amount realized. </T3>The amount realized from the sale,exchange or disposition of several assets in one transaction is allocatedamong them in proportion to their respective fair market values. This allocationis made under the principles set forth in andSection;1.1245-1(a)(5) (relatingto allocation between section 1245 property and non-section 1245 property).(7) <T3>Interest. </T3>Gross income from the sale, exchange or dispositionof an asset used in a section 907(c) activity includes interest incomefrom such a sale, exchange or disposition. (f) <T3>Terms and items common to FORI and FOGEI_</T3>(1) <T3>Minerals. </T3>The term ``minerals'' means hydrocarbon minerals extractedfrom oil and gas wells, including crude oil or natural gas (as definedin section 613A(e)). The term includes incidental impurities from thesewells, such as sulphur, nitrogen, or helium. The term does not includehydrocarbon minerals derived from shale oil or tar sands. (2) <T3>Taxable income. </T3>Deductions to be taken into account in computingtaxable income or net operating loss attributable to FOGEI or FORI aredetermined under the principles of andSection;1.861-8. For an exception withregard to losses, see paragraph (e)(4) of this section. (3) <T3>Interest on working capital. </T3>FORI and FOGEI may include intereston bank deposits or on any other temporary investment which is not in excessof funds reasonably necessary to meet the working capital requirementsand the specifically anticipated business needs of the person that is engagedin the conduct of the activities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2).(4) <T3>Exchange gain or loss. </T3>Exchange gain (and loss) may be FORI andFOGEI. (5) <T3>Allocation. </T3>Interest income and exchange gain (or loss) described,respectively, in paragraph (f) (3) and (4) of this section are allocatedamong FORI, FOGEI, and any other class of income relevant for purposesof the foreign tax credit limitations under any reasonable method whichis consistently applied from year to year. (6) <T3>Facts and circumstances. </T3>Income not described elsewhere in thissection may be FOGEI or FORI if, under the facts and circumstances in theparticular case, the income is in substance directly attributable to theactivities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2). For example, assumethat a producer in the North Sea suffers a casualty caused by an explosion,fire, and resulting destruction of a drilling platform. Insurance proceedsreceived for the platform's destruction in excess of the producer's basisis extraction income if the excess constitutes income from sources outsidethe United States. In addition, income from an insurance policy for businessinterruption may be extraction income to the extent the payments underthe policy are geared directly to the loss of income from production andare treated as income from sources outside the United States. Also, ifan oil company's oil concession or assets used in extraction activitiesdescribed in section 907(c)(1)(A) and located outside the United Statesare nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentalitythereof, income derived from that nationalization or expropriation (includinginterest on the income paid pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation)is FOGEI. Likewise, if a company's assets used in the activities describedin section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and located outside the United Statesare nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentalitythereof, income (including interest on the income paid pursuant to thenationalization or expropriation) derived from the nationalization or expropriationwill be FORI. Nationalization or expropriation is deemed to be a sale orexchange for purposes of section 907(c)(1)(B) and a disposition for purposesof section 907(c)(2)(D). In further example, assume that an oil companyhas an exclusive right to buy all the oil in country X from Y, an instrumentalityof the foreign sovereign which owns all of the oil in X. The oil companydoes not have an economic interest in any oil in country X. Y has a temporarycash-flow problem and demands that the oil company make advance depositsfor the purpose of oil not yet delivered. In return, Y grants the oil companya discount on the price of the oil when delivered. Income represented bythe discount on the later disposition of the oil is FORI described in section907(c)(2)(C). The result would be the same if Y credited the oil companywith interest on the advance deposits, which had to be used to purchaseoil (the interest income would be FORI). (g) <T3>Directly related income_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Section 907(c)(2)(E) and this paragraph (g) includein FORI, and this paragraph (g) includes in FOGEI, income from the performanceof directly related services (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section).This paragraph (g) also includes in FORI and FOGEI income from the leaseor license of related property (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of thissection). Section 907(c)(2)(E) with regard to FORI and this paragraph (g)with regard to both FORI and FOGEI do not apply to a person if_ (i) Neither that person nor a related person (as defined in paragraph (g)(4)of this section) has FOGEI described in paragraph (b) of this section (otherthan paragraph (b)(4) thereof relating to directly related income) or FORIdescribed in paragraph (d) of this section (other than paragraph (d)(7)thereof relating to directly related income), or (ii) Less than 50 percent of that person's gross income from sources outsidethe United States which is related exclusively to the performance of servicesand from the lease or license of property described in paragraph (g) (2)and (3) of this section, respectively, is attributable to services performedfor (or on behalf of), leases to, or licenses with, related persons, but(iii) Subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (g)(1) will not apply to a personif 50 percent or more of that person's total gross income from sourcesoutside the United States is FOGEI and FORI (as both are described in subdivision(i) of this paragraph (g)(1)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A person described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this paragraph will,however, have directly related services income which is FOGEI if the incomeis so classified by reason of the income based on output test set forthin paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section. (2) <T3>Directly related services</T3>_(i) <T3>FOGEI. </T3>(A) Income from directly related services will be FOGEI,as that term is defined in paragraph (b) (1) and (3) of this section, ifthose services are directly related to the active conduct of extraction(including exploration) of minerals from oil and gas wells. Paragraph (b)(1)of this section provides that, in order to have extraction income, a personmust have an economic interest in the minerals in place. However, paragraph(b)(3) of this section recognizes that income arising from ``other circumstances''is extraction income if that income is in substance attributable to theextraction of minerals. (B) An example of ``other circumstances'' under paragraph (b)(3) of thissection is the ``income based on output test.'' This income based on outputtest provides that, if the amount of compensation paid or credited to aperson for services is dependent on the amount of minerals discovered orextracted, the income of the person from the performance of the serviceswill be directly related services income which is FOGEI. This test willapply whether or not the person performing the services has, or had, aneconomic interest in the minerals discovered or extracted. (ii) <T3>FORI. </T3>With regard to the determination of directly related servicesincome which is FORI, directly related services are those services directlyrelated to the active conduct of the operations described in section 907(c)(2)(A) through (C). Those services include, for example, services performedin relation to the distribution of minerals or primary products or in connectionwith the operation of a refinery, or the types of services described inandSection; 1.954-6(d) (other than paragraph (d)(4) thereof) which relateto foreign base company shipping income. (iii) <T3>Recipient of the services. </T3>Directly related services describedin paragraph (g)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section may be performed for anyperson without regard to whether that person is a related person. (iv) <T3>Excluded services</T3>_(A) <T3>FOGEI. </T3>Directly related services which produce FOGEI do not includeinsurance, accounting or managerial services. (B) <T3>FORI. </T3>Directly related services income which produce FORI do not,generally, include insurance, accounting or managerial services. Theseservices will, however, produce FORI if they are performed by the personperforming the operations described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C).For these purposes, insurance income which is FORI means taxable incomeas defined in section 832(a). (3) <T3>Leases and licenses. </T3>A lease or license of related property isthe lease or license of assets used (or held for use) by the lessor, licensor,or another person (including the lessee or a sublessee) in the active conductof the activities described in section 907 (c)(1)(A) or (c)(2) (A) through(C). The leases or licenses described in this paragraph (g)(3) include,for example, a lease of a means of transportation under a bareboat charterhire, of drilling equipment used in extraction operations, or the licenseof a patent, know-how, or similar intangible property used in extracting,transporting, distributing or processing minerals or primary products.This paragraph (g)(3) applies without regard to whether the parties arerelated persons. (4) <T3>Related person. </T3>A person will be treated as a related person forpurposes of this paragraph (g) if (i) that person would be so treated withinthe meaning of section 954(d)(3) (as applied by substituting the word ``corporation''for the word ``controlled foreign corporation'') or (ii) that person isa partnership or partner described in section 707(b)(1). (5) <T3>Gross income. </T3>A foreign corporation shall be treated as a domesticcorporation for the purpose of applying the gross-income rules in paragraph(g)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.(h) <T3>Coordination with other provisions_</T3>(1) <T3>Certain adjustments. </T3>The character of income as FOGEI or FORIis determined before making any adjustment under section 482 or section907(d). For example, assume that X and Y are related parties, Y's onlyincome is from the sale of oil that Y purchased from X, and FOGEI fromX is diverted to Y through an arrangement described in paragraph (b)(3)of this section. Accordingly, Y has FOGEI. If under section 482 the Commissionerreallocates the FOGEI from Y to X, then Y's remaining income representsonly a profit from distributing the oil, and thus is FORI. If the foreigntaxes paid by Y on this income are otherwise creditable under section 901,the foreign taxes that are not refunded to Y retain their characterizationas FOGEI taxes. (2) <T3>Section 901(f). </T3>Section 901(f) (relating to certain payments withrespect to oil and gas not considered as taxes) applies before section907. Taxes disallowed by section 901(f) are added to the cost or inventoryamount of oil or gas. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.907(c)-2T Section 907(c)(3) items (for taxable years beginningafter December 31, 1982) (Temporary regulations). </ITAG>(a) <T3>Scope. </T3>This section provides rules relating to certain items listedin section 907(c)(3). The rules of this section are expressed in termsof FORI but apply for determining FOGEI by substituting ``FOGEI'' for ``FORI''whenever appropriate. FOGEI does not include interest described in section907(c)(3)(A) or dividends described in section 907(c)(3)(B). (b) <T3>Dividend</T3>_(1) <T3>Section 1248 dividend. </T3>A section 1248 dividend is a dividend describedin section 907(c)(3)(A). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph(b)(1) or in andSection; 1.907(c)-1T(e)(3), gain (or loss) from the dispositionof stock in any corporation is not FOGEI or FORI. (2) <T3>Section 78 dividend. </T3>A section 78 dividend is FORI to the extentit arises from a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A), or an amountdescribed in section 907(c)(3)(C). (c) <T3>Taxes deemed paid</T3>_(1) <T3>Voting stock test. </T3>Items described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or(C) are FORI only if a deemed-paid-tax test is met under the criteria ofsection 902 or 960. The purpose of this test is to require minimum director indirect ownership by a domestic corporation in the voting stock ofa foreign corporation as a prerequisite for the item to qualify as FORIin the hands of the domestic corporation. The test is whether a domesticcorporation would be deemed to pay any taxes of a foreign corporation whena dividend or an amount described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C), respectively,is included in the domestic corporation's gross income. In the case ofinterest described in section 907(c)(3)(A), the test is whether any taxeswould be deemed paid if there were a hypothetical dividend. (2) <T3>Dividends and interest. </T3>For purposes of section 907(c)(3)(A),a domestic corporation is deemed under section 902 to pay taxes in respectof dividends and interest received from a foreign corporation if the followingcondition is met: the domestic corporation would be deemed under section902 to pay taxes in respect of dividends received from the foreign corporationwhether or not the foreign corporation_ (i) Actually pays or is deemed to pay taxes, or (ii) In the case of interest, actually pays dividends.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This paragraph (c)(2) also applies to dividends received by a foreigncorporation from a second-tier or third-tier foreign corporation (as definedin andSection; 1.902-1(a) (3)(i) and (4), respectively). In the case of interestreceived by a foreign corporation from another foreign corporation, thisparagraph (c)(2) applies if the taxes of both foreign corporations wouldbe deemed paid under section 902 (a) or (b) for purposes of applying section902(a) to the same taxpayer which is a domestic corporation. In the caseof interest received by any corporation (whether foreign or domestic),all members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return will betreated as the same taxpayer under section 907(c)(3)(A) if the foreigntaxes of the payor and (if the recipient is a foreign corporation) theforeign taxes of the recipient would be deemed paid under section 902 byat least one member. The term ``member'' is defined in andSection; 1.1502-1(b).Thus, for example, assume that P owns all of the stock of D1 and D2 andP, D1, and D2 are members of an affiliated group filing a consolidatedreturn. Assume further that D1 owns all of the stock of F1 and D2 ownsall of the stock of F2, where F1 and F2 are foreign corporations. Interestpaid by F1 to P, D2, or F2 may be FORI. (3) <T3>Amounts included under section 951(a). </T3>For purposes of section907(c)(3)(C), a domestic corporation is deemed under section 960 to paytaxes in respect of a foreign corporation, whether or not the foreign corporationactually pays taxes on the amounts included in gross income under section951(a).

However, any deficit in earnings and profitswithin a separate category for the taxable year attributable either toFOGEI or FORI is to be allocated first to FORI or FOGEI (as the case maybe) earnings and profits within a separate category before the deficitis allocated in that taxable year to earnings and profits that are notattributable to FORI and FOGEI, within the same separate category. Anydeficit in FORI or FOGEI earnings and profits remaining after allocationwithin the first separate category will be allocated on a pro rata basisto other separate categories and will be allocated within those separatecategories, first, to earnings and profits attributable to FORI or FOGEIdepending on to which type of earnings and profits the deficit is attributable,second, to earnings and profits attributable to FORI and FOGEI, and, third,to other earnings and profits. For taxable years beginning before January1, 1987, any deficit in FORI or FOGEI earnings and profits remaining afterallocation within the first separate category will be allocated againstearnings and profits attributable to United States source income and thento other separate categories pursuant to the preceding sentence. FORI earningsand profits are the earnings and profits attributable to FORI as definedin section 907(c) (2) and (3). FOGEI earnings and profits are the earningsand profits attributable to FOGEI as defined in section 907(c)(1)(3).(8) <T3>Illustrations. </T3>The application of this paragraph (d) is illustratedby the following examples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stockof Y, a foreign corporation organized in country S.

Assume that Z paid no taxes to S and X must include $100 in itsgross income under section 951(a) with respect to Z. Under paragraph (d)(4)(i)of this section, $37.50 of the amount described in section 951(a) is FOGEI($100andmultiply;$150/$400).

Accordingly,under paragraph (d)(4)(i), $30 will be FOGEI and $60 will be FORI to X.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>(i) Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example</T3> (1). Assume further that, in 1983, Z distributes its entireearnings and profits ($400) to Y, which consists of a dividend of $300and a section 959(a)(1) distribution of $100. Y has no other earnings andprofits during 1983. Assume that the dividend and distribution are notforeign personal holding company income under section 954(c). Y pays notaxes to S. In 1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and profits to X.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Under paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, Y hasFOGEI of $112.50, <T3>i.e., </T3>the amount of the dividend received by Y ($300) multipliedby the fraction described in paragraph (d)(1)(i). The numerator of thefraction is Z's FOGEI accumulated profits in excess of the FOGEI taxespaid ($112.50) and the denominator is Z's total accumulated profits inexcess of total foreign taxes paid ($400) minus the amount excluded fromY's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($100). The rule of paragraph(d)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply since X does not include anyamount in its gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. If Ypaid taxes to S, this paragraph (9d) would apply to characterize thosetaxes as FOGEI taxes or other taxes.

Under paragraphs(d)(1)(i) and (6)(i) of this section, $112.50 of the dividend is FOGEI,<T3>i.e., </T3>the amount of the dividend ($300) multiplied by a fraction.The numerator of the fraction is $112.50, <T3>i.e., </T3>the FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxespaid ($150) minus the FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEItaxes paid excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($37.50).The denominator of the fraction is $300, <T3>i.e., </T3>the total accumulated profits of Y in excess of taxes paid($400) minus the amount excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1)($100).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example </T3>(1) with the following modifications: In 1983, Z's onlyearnings and profits are FORI earnings and profits which are included inX's gross income under section 951(a).

In 1983, Y has total earnings and profits of $100 withoutregard to the dividend from Z, $60 of which are FORI earnings and profits.Y also has $40 which is included in X's gross income under section 951(a).Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, the dividend from Z is disregardedfor purposes of applying paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to the $40included in X's gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. Accordingly,$24 of the amount described in section 951(a) is FORI ($40andmultiply;$60/$100).Had these circumstances existed in 1988, and if the $40 included in X'sgross income under section 951(a) was directly attributable to FORI activity,all of that income would be FORI to X.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Dividends, interest, and other amounts from sources within a possession.</T3>FORI includes the items listed in section 907(c)(3) (A) and (C) tothe extent attributable to FORI of a corporation that is created or organizedin or under the laws of a possession of the United States.(f) <T3>Income from partnerships, trusts, etc. </T3>FORI and FOGEI includea person's distributive share (determined under the principles of section704) of the income of any partnership and amounts included in income undersubchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the taxation of trusts,estates, and beneficiaries) to the extent the income and amounts are attributableto FORI and FOGEI. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.907(c)-3T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">FOGEI and FORI taxes (for taxable years beginning after December 31,1982) (Temporary regulations). </ITAG>(a) <T3>Tax characterization, allocation and apportionment_</T3>(1) <T3>Scope. </T3>Paragraphs (a) (2) through (6) of this section providesrules for the characterization, allocation, and apportionment of the incometaxes (other than withholding taxes) paid or accrued to a foreign countryamong FOGEI, FORI, and other income relevant for purposes of sections 907and 904. Some of the rules in this section are expressed in terms of FOGEItaxes but they apply to FORI taxes by substituting ``FORI taxes'' for ``FOGEItaxes'' whenever appropriate. For the treatment of withholding taxes, seeparagraph (a)(8) of this section. FOGEI taxes are determined without anyreduction under section 907(a). In addition, determination of FOGEI taxeswill not be affected by recharacterization of FOGEI by section 907(c)(4).See andSection; 1.907(c)-1T(c)(5).

More than one class of incomeis taxed under the same base, if, under a foreign country's law, deductionsfrom one class of income may reduce the income of any other class and theclasses are subject to foreign tax at the same rates.(4) <T3>Allocation of tax within a base. </T3>If more than one class of incomeis taxed under the same base under a foreign country's law, the pre-creditforeign tax for the base is apportioned to each class of income in proportionto the income of each class. Tax credits are then allocated (under paragraph(a)(6) of this section) to the apportioned pre-credit tax. Income of aclass is the excess of modified gross income for a class over the deductionsallowed under foreign law for, and which are attributable to, that class.(5) <T3>Modified gross income. </T3>Modified gross income is not necessarilythe same as gross income as defined for purposes of chapter 1 of the InternalRevenue Code. Modified gross income is determined with reference to theforeign tax base for gross income (or its equivalent). However, the characterizationof the base as a particular class of income is governed by general principlesof U.S. tax law. Thus, for example_ (i) Gross income from extraction is the fair market value of oil or gasin the immediate vicinity of the well (as determined under andSection; 1.907(c)-1T(b)(6)(without any deductions)). (ii) Whether cost of goods sold (or any other deduction) is a deductionfrom modified gross income and the amount of such a deduction is determinedunder foreign law. (iii) Modified gross income includes items that are part of the foreigntax base even though they are not gross income under U.S. law so long asthe foreign taxes paid on the base constitute creditable taxes under section901 (including taxes described in section 903). For example, if a foreigncountry imposes a tax (creditable under section 901) on a tax base thatincludes in small part a percentage of the value of a company's oil reservesin place, modified gross income from extraction includes such a percentageof value solely for purposes of making the tax allocation in paragraph(a)(4) of this section. (iv) Modified gross income from extraction is increased for purposes ofthis paragraph (a)(5) by the entire excess of the posted price over fairmarket value if the foreign country uses a posted price system or otherpricing arrangement described in section 907(d) in imposing its incometax.(v) Modified gross income from FORI is that income attributable to theactivities in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and (E). (vi) Modified gross income for any class may not include gross income thatis not subject to taxation by the foreign country. (6) <T3>Allocation of tax credits. </T3>The foreign taxes paid or accrued ona particular class of income equals the pre-credit tax on the class reduced(but not below zero) by the credits allowed under foreign law against theforeign tax on the particular class. Any tax credit attributable to a classthat is not allocated to that class is allocated to the other class inthe base or, if there are three classes in the base, is apportioned ratablyamong the taxes paid or accrued on the other two classes (as reduced inaccordance with the preceding sentence). (7) <T3>Withholding taxes. </T3>Paragraph (a) (2) through (6) of this sectiondoes not apply to withholding taxes imposed by a foreign country. FOGEItaxes may include withholding taxes imposed with respect to a distributionfrom a corporation. The portion of the total withholding taxes on a distributionthat constitutes FOGEI taxes is determined by the portion of the distributionthat is FOGEI. In addition, FOGEI taxes may include taxes imposed on adistribution described in section 959(a)(1) or on amounts described insection 959(b). The portion of the total withholding taxes imposed on adistribution described in section 959(a)(1) or on amounts described insection 959(b) is determined by reference to the portion of the amountincluded in gross income under section 951(a) that was FOGEI.

Y owns all of the stockof Z, a foreign corporation organized in country T. Each corporation usedthe calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, X includes in its grossincome an amount described in section 951(a) with respect to Z. Assumethat the taxes deemed paid under section 902(a) by X by reason of suchan inclusion is $70. Assume further that Z paid total taxes of $120, $80of which is FOGEI tax. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the FOGEI taxdeemed paid is $46.67 (<T3>i.e.,</T3> $70 x $80/$120). This $46.67 is also FOGEI under andSection;1.907(c)-2T(d)(5)because it must be included in X's gross income under section 78.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> (i) Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example</T3> (1). Assume further that in 1983, Z distributes its entireearnings and profits to Y. Y has no earnings and profits during 1983 otherthan this dividend. Y paid a tax of $50 to S. Assume that Y is deemed undersection 902(b)(1) to pay $50 of the tax paid by Z which was not deemedpaid by X under section 960(a)(1) in 1983. In 1983, Y distributes its entireearnings and profits to X. Assume that X is deemed under section 902(a)to pay $100 of the taxes actually paid, and deemed paid, by Y. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to characterize the$50 tax of Z that Y is deemed to pay under section 902(b)(1). Y is deemedto pay $33.33 of FOGEI tax, <T3>i.e., </T3> the amount of the tax deemed paid by Y ($50) multipliedby a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of Z's FOGEItax ($80) and the denominator is the total taxes paid by Z ($120).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Under paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a portion of the $50tax actually paid by Y on the earnings and profits received from Z is FOGEItax. The amount of tax actually paid by Y that is FOGEI tax depends onthe amount of the distribution from Z that is FOGEI (see andSection;1.907(c)-2T(d)(1)(i)and <T3>Example</T3> (2) (ii) under andSection;1.907(c)-2T(d)(8)). This resultdoes not depend upon whether a portion of the distribution from Z is describedin section 959(b) and it follows even though a portion of Y's earningsand profits will be excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1)when distributed by Y. Assume that $12.50 of the $50 tax actually paidby Y is FOGEI tax.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, X is deemed to pay $45.83of FOGEI tax by reason of the distribution from Y. This amount is determinedby multiplying the total taxes deemed paid by X by reason of such distribution($100) by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the FOGEI tax paid,and deemed paid, by Y ($45.83, <T3>i.e.,</T3> $33.33 under subdivision (ii) of this example plus $12.50under subdivision (iii) of this example). The denominator of the fractionis the total taxes paid, and deemed paid, by Y ($100). This $45.83 is FOGEIunder andSection;1.907(c)-2T(d)(5) because it is included in X's gross incomeas a section 78 dividend.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>(i) X, a domestic corporation, has a concession withforeign country Y that gives it the exclusive right to extract and exportthe crude oil and natural gas owned by Y. The concession agreement andlocation of the oil and gas wells mandate that X construct a system ofpipelines to transport the minerals that are extracted to a port wherethey are loaded onto tankers for export. X owns the transportation facilities.Y has an income tax system under which income from mineral operations issubject to a 50 percent tax rate. The taxation by Y of the mineral operationsis a separate tax base under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Under thissystem, Y imposes the tax at the port prior to export and it establishesa posted price of $12 per barrel. Y also collects royalties of $1.44 perbarrel (<T3>i.e., </T3>12 percent of this posted price) which is deductible incomputing the petroleum tax. Y also allows X deductible lifting costs of$.20 per barrel and deductible transporting costs of $.80 per barrel. Ydoes not allow any credits against the mineral tax. Assume that X doesnot have any income in Y other than the mineral income. (In 1983, X extracts,transports, and exports 10,000,000 barrels of crude oil, but for convenience,all computations are in terms of one barrel).
