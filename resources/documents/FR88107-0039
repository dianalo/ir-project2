ANR Pipeline Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP88-137-000]</ITAG>Take notice that on December 21, 1987, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243, filed in Docket No. CP88-137-000,an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificateof public convenience and necessity authorizing new storage services pursuantto two new rate schedules, Rate Schedules FSS (Firm Storage Service) andDDS (Deferred Delivery Service) to be incorporated in a new ANR OriginalVolume No. 1-B FERC Gas Tariff.ANR states that the proposed Rate Schedule FSS provides for a firm winterstorage service. It is stated that under such rate schedule, one optionis storage service only. It is further stated that the other option undersuch schedule is a combined storage and transportation service option,under which both storage and firm transportation to and from storage isincluded. ANR states that for the period November 1 through March 31 (winterperiod), the maximum daily withdrawal quantity cannot be greater than 1/50of the maximum storage quantity, nor less than 1/150 of the maximum storagequantity. The maximum daily withdrawal quantity and maximum storage quantity,it is indicated, would be specified in the FSS service agreement. ANR statesthat requests for withdrawals above the maximum daily withdrawal quantitywould be accepted on a best efforts basis. It is stated that for the periodApril 1 through October 31 (summer period), the maximum daily injectionquantity is 1/200 of the maximum storage quantity. ANR further states thatrequests for injection quantities above the maximum daily injection quantitywould be accepted on a best efforts basis.It is explained that on an annual basis, a FSS customer which is an existingsales customer of ANR may elect to purchase injection gas from ANR or others.ANR states that if a FSS customer purchases injection gas from ANR underresale Rate Schedules CD-1, MC-1 or SGS-1 of Original Volume No. 1 of ANR'sFERC Gas Tariff, the transportation components of the FSS rate would bewaived for such quantities that a FSS customer purchases under said resalerate schedules. To effectuate this provision, ANR requests such certificateauthority as is necessary to add to all of its existing CD-1, MC-1 andSGS-1 service agreements the Injection/Withdrawal Point as a point of deliveryunder such service agreements.ANR states that the charge for FSS service would consist of a FSS deliverabilityreservation charge of $2.05 per dth per month, a FSS capacity reservationcharge of $.2520 per dth, a FSS injection-withdrawal commodity charge of$.0011 per dth, plus applicable transportation reservation and commoditycharges if the combined storage and transportation service option is chosen.It is stated that such transportation charges are equal to the maximumand minimum FTS-1 rates under ANR's Original Volume No. 1-A FERC Gas Tariff.It is also stated that fuel shall consist of 1 percent for storage andup to 3 percent for transportation, which shipper, at its option, may providein kind or reimburse ANR for at ANR's cost of gas. It is explained thatif transportation from the point(s) of receipt to storage and from storageto the point(s) of delivery is provided under separate FTS-1, FTS-2 orITS agreements, the mainline area access reservation and mainline areaaccess commodity charges under Rate Schedules FTS-1, FTS-2 or ITS coveringtransportation to and from storage will be charged only on injection. Itis stated that Rate Schedule FSS would be available to all shippers ona first-come, first-served basis.It is stated that Rate Schedule DDS (Deferred Delivery Service) is an interruptiblestorage service that ANR would make available from time to time if it hasstorage capacity available after providing for firm resale, firm storageand firm transportation obligations.

Yukon Pacific Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP88-105-000]</ITAG>Take notice that on December 3, 1987, Yukon Pacific Corporation (YukonPacific, P. O. Box 101700, Anchorage, Alaska 99510) filed in Docket No.CP88-105-000 an application pursuant to Department of Energy DelegationOrder No. 0204-112 (49 FR 6684), as interpreted by the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission's (Commission) Declaratory Order issued May 27, 1987, <T3>(Yukon Pacific Corporation, </T3>39 FERC andpara;61,216 (1987)) for authorizationto utilize a site certain at Anderson Bay, Alaska located at the Port ofValdez, Alaska, for the exportation from the United States of liquefiednatural gas (LNG), all as more fully set forth in the application whichis on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.Yukon Pacific, an investor-corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Alaska, states that it was formed to, among other things, construct,operate and maintain the Trans-Alaska Gas System (TAGS) and to market naturalgas transported through TAGS in the Pacific Rim countries of the Republicof China (Taiwan), Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Currently, no facilitiesexist in the state of Alaska ot transport Alaskan North Slope natural gasto any market, either domestic or foreign, it is indicated.It is stated that the TAGS Project includes the construction of a whollyintrastate 796.5 mile, 36-inch diameter, buried and chilled natural gaspipeline originating at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska Bay, Alaska, Yukon Pacificavers that the pipeline is designed to transport up to 2.3 Bcf of naturalgas per day. It is explained that the TAGS Project also includes (1) Theconstruction of an LNG plant designed to remove any impurities from theincoming gas and to reduce the temperature of the transported gas to minus259anddegrees; F, thereby condensing the gas to a liquid state for storageand shipping; (2) the construction of four LNG storage tanks, each withan individual capacity of 800,000 barrels (bbls); (3) the constructionof a marine terminal designed to berth and load two LNG tankers; and (4)LNG ocean transport vessels having individual cargo capacities of a nominal125,000 cubic meters. The natural gas production wells and gathering systemsnecessary for, but apart from the TAGS project, are already in place toproduce and gather the gas from the North Slope reservoirs, it is stated.Yukon Pacific proposes to export up to 14 million metric tons of LNG annuallyfrom the proposed Anderson Bay export site, via LNG ocean transport vessels,for a term of at least 25 years, commencing some time in 1996.It is stated that on December 18, 1986, Yukon Pacific filed a Petitionfor Declaratory Order with the Commission in Docket No. GP87-16-000, requestingthe Commission to declare the extent of its jurisdiction over the construction,maintenance, and operation of Yukon Pacific's proposed intrastate naturalgas transportation and liquefaction facilities. Applicant states that onMay 27, 1987, the Commission issued a Declaratory Order in response toYukon Pacific's petition seeking a jurisdictional determination as to theapplicability, if any, of the Natural Gas Act to the TAGS Project. In thatOrder, states Yukon Pacific, the Commission (1) determined that the theconstruction and operation of the TAGS Project falls beyond the jurisdictionalpurview of section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, (2) declined ``to exerciseany discretionary authority it may have under section 3 of the NaturalGas Act to regulate the siting, construction and operation of the TAGSpipeline'' (39 FERC (CCH) at p. 61,759), but (3) determined that pursuantto the ``allocation of authority in the Secretary's delegation orders''it has limited jurisdiction to approve or disapprove (to the extent notpreviously disapproved by the Administrator) the place of export of thenatural gas'' (<T3>Id.</T3> at andpara;61,758). Yukon Pacific, therefore, states that itsfiling is being made in response to the Commission's own interpretationof the authority delegated to the Commission by the Secretary of Energy,as set fourth in Part (3) above. According to Yukon Pacific, the factualpredicates upon which the Commission's Declaratory Order is based havenot changed. Yukon Pacific states that its application is being submittedfor the sole purpose of obtaining authorization to utilize the place ofexport proposed by it.Yukon Pacific indicates that the Department of Interior and the Army Corpsof Engineers have prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS),issued in Septemer 1987, which includes a study of the entire project fromPrudhoe Bay to Anderson Bay. The FERC environmental staff participatedas a cooperating agency in preparation of the DEIS, it is stated. As acooperations agency, the FERC staff provided comments on the DEIS on November20, 1987, and is working with the Bureau of Land Management on completionof the Final Environmental Impact Statement, it is indicated.Yukon Pacific states that its filing is not in conformance with, nor isbeing submitted pursuant to, the Commission's import/export regulationsset forth at 18 CFR Part 153. It is stated that none of the Commission'sregulations directly contemplate Yukon Pacific's Application as requiredby the Commission's Declaratory Order. Therefore, it has prepared its applicationusing portions of the Part 153 regulations as a general guideline, it isexplained.The application incorporates by reference the TAGS Project EnvironmentalImpact Statement for primary consideration by the Commission in determiningthe place of export and, further, requests the Commission to act upon theapplication expeditiously. A delay in making the requested determinationwould possibly cause Yukon Pacific and the United States to forfeit an$80 billion LNG market to Indonesian and other competing foreign suppliers,it is indicated.<T3>Comment date:</T3> January 25, 1988, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Paragraphs </ITAG>F.
