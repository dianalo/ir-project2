The test, known as provocation-neutralization, is mostoften used by doctors known as clinical ecologists. Theybelieve a wide variety of ailments result from exposure tofood and chemicals in the environment.</LP><TEXT>   The challenge to the test, published in a study in today'sNew England Journal of Medicine, is a setback to clinicalecologists and underscores their differences with traditionalallergy doctors, who use a similar test in treating patients,but who generally eschew provocation-neutralization.   The study, combined with previous research, &quot;raises a verysevere question,&quot; says Don L. Jewett, professor of orthopedicsurgery at the University of California, San Francisco, andprincipal author of the report. &quot;Is this treatment doinganything?&quot;   Two years ago, federal health regulators withdrew coverageof the test for Medicare patients, saying available evidencedidn't indicate the test and associated treatment wereeffective.   Proponents of the test say the coverage decision is underchallenge. Aubrey Worrell, president of the American Academyof Environmental Medicine, said several other studies vouchfor its value. He said he continues to use the test onselected patients and finds it effective.   Under the technique, doctors inject patients with anallergen extract. If symptoms are provoked, they administeradditional doses until they find a level that relieves orneutralizes symptoms. The neutralized dose level serves as abasis for treatment.   But Dr. Jewett and his colleagues determined that patientsundergoing the tests couldn't tell the difference betweenactive allergens and a dummy or placebo solution used as acontrol. Indeed patients were just as likely to report areaction to an injection whether it was active or inert.   The researchers based their conclusions on 20 tests of 18different patients in seven doctors' offices. The doctorswere proponents of the sensitivity tests and well-versed intheir use, the researchers reported. Only patients whopreviously reacted to such tests were studied.   Each person was injected 12 times during the test, threetimes with an active allergen extract and nine times with aninert, control solution. The doctors, patients andtechnicians administering the tests didn't know whichsyringes contained active solutions.   Ten minutes after each injection, patients were asked todecide whether the substance was active or inert. Substancestested included chocolate, milk, yeast, and chicken.   The researchers said the patients accurately picked 16 of60, or 27%, of active injections and judged 44 of 180, or 24%of the inert injections to be positive. &quot;The symptoms thatwere provoked were generally unrelated to the contents of thesyringes,&quot; the researchers added. In addition, neutralizingdoses, when applied, were equally effective in treatingsymptoms &quot;provoked&quot; by both active and inert solutions.</TEXT></DOC>
