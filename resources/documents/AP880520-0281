He's no plane. And in the firstissue he makes the mistake of trying to rescue Superman.   He's ``The Tick,'' a clumsy, muscle-bound comic book superheroin a tick costume who has escaped from a Minnesota insane asylum tobecome the protector of Boston.   ``The Tick'' is also the first publishing venture of New EnglandComics, a bookstore chain anchored in Boston that is thriving on aresurgent national interest in comic books.   Comic books have come of age along with their readers. Oldfavorites are being remodeled, and a new generation of adult comicstakes chances with art, content and subtle humor. Vivid drawingsare richly detailed and often seem charged with an electric current.   ``It's exploded,'' said George Suarez, a 33-year-old accountantwho co-founded New England Comics five years ago. ``Comics arebeing read by more and more of the general population. It used tobe you didn't admit you read comics if you were over 13.''   Comic books are proliferating in a way not seen since the early1950s when readership was estimated at 4 million. But it's not allthe same old Superman and Lulu that generated $300 million inretail sales last year.   ``Wonder Woman,'' for instance, created in 1941 and published byDC Comics, recently relocated to intellectual Boston and took asher mentor an archaeologist at Harvard University.   Her new artist and writer, George Perez, is 33 and based in NewYork. He consulted with former Ms. magazine editor Gloria Steinembefore modernizing Wonder Woman.   ``I try to hold on to some fans, trying to `adultify' herwithout ignoring our younger reader,'' said Perez, who said WonderWoman has soared out of a slump to become one of DC's top fivesellers.   ``Wonder Woman is most definitely a feminist, or a humanist, inno uncertain terms,'' he said. ``Her prime goal in life is to teachpeaceful coexistence and equality.''   Other adult comics include Omaha Cat Dancer, which deals withmale-female relationships, and the Punisher, about a Vietnamveteran whose adventures address such contemporary issues as drugsand white-collar crime on Wall Street.   Comic books emerged in 1933 as an evolutionary offshoot of comicstrips, neatly reflecting the churnings of American popular culture.   In the mid-1950s, comic books were widely read for theirdetailed and energetic violence and often moralistic messagesrailing against war and racism. But their very popularityfrightened people, and in a McCarthy era backlash, comic books wereaccused of causing juvenile delinquency.   Senate hearings were held. The industry retreated and comic bookpublishers instituted self-censorship with the Comics CodeAuthority. With comic books tamed, their audience shrank.   Comic books began to recover, however, in the '60s when productsof the baby boom toddled off to college and found the superheroswaiting for them.   Like everything else, that revival of mainstream fare also hadits anti-establishment variety in underground ``comix,'' with theirstories about hippies, long-haired motorcyclists and loose sex. ZapComics and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers were among the starsof the underground comix market.   The future computer scientists, engineers, defense analysts andpsychologists who read those comic books still buy them. But theirtastes have aged.   ``Today's comics readers expect more, they expect depth ofcharacter,'' said Marc Dolan, who is earning a doctorate at HarvardUniversity in the history of American civilization and is a studentof comics. ``They want earthy realism, like the way Stephen Kingblends werewolves with Burger King.''   These grown-up comic books can be read on two levels, he said.``It's sort of like Huck Finn. You can have fun, or you can saythis thing is coming down the river and what does it mean?''   Comic books have eclipsed stamps, coins and wine as collectibleinvestments, according to Jerry Weist, a Boston comic bookcollector and dealer for 28 years.   However, while Weist estimated the number of collectors today ataround 250,000 million, he said few will make anywhere near the$60,000 fetched in the past year by a single mint-condition issueof the first Marvel Comics.   ``A lot of it has gotten out of hand,'' he said. ``Collecting isrisky. ... Stamps, coins and wines have been around for threecenturies and they will outlast comic books.'' Weist predicted thatthe cheap paper on which comics are printed will not allow them tolast, and in 50 or 75 years those precious early copies of Supermanand the others won't be worth holding on to.   The Boston area is thick with stores that specialize in thehigher-priced comic books than run from 75 cents to $15 andsupplement newsstand offerings.   That's the story around the country, said John Davis, aco-founder of Capital City Distribution in Madison, Wis., thecountry's biggest comic book distributor, carrying every one of theapproximately 400 titles available.   Davis said in a telephone interview that the average comic bookreader is a 20-year-old male, although about 20 percent of comicbook fans are older. He estimates there are just half a millionregular readers of comics, about 5 percent of them female.   ``These are an example of the growing sophistication of comicbooks as an art form in the past five to 10 years,'' Davis said.``In a way, that may be a result of the fact that the baby boom isgrowing older.   ``Comics today are better than they ever have been. Comics havegrown up.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
