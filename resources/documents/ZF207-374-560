(OMG).andP;  The OMG is aninternational organization devoted to making computer systems and softwarefrom different manufacturers communicate and work together more efficientlyusing object-oriented technology.andP;  &quot;Object management will be the nextsignificant breakthrough in application environments,&quot; claims Christopher M.andO;Stone, executive director of the consortium and group manager of software forData General Corp.andM;OMG will promote industry-wide adoption of a common application based on thatconcept.andP;  An object-oriented environment treats different types of data andapplications like building blocks that can be mixed across systems to createcomplex applications quickly and easily.andP;  &quot;Our goal is to achieve a common,worldwide, object-oriented applications-integration environment that willallow users to mix and match independently developed applications acrossvarious operating systems,&quot; Stone said.andP;  &quot;We shall adopt and support a coreof commercially available implementations, actively influence theiracceptance and development, and establish a mechanism for certifying thatthese implementations comply with the core technology.&quot;andM;Other members of the new group include Canon Inc., Philips InternationalB.V., Prime Computer Inc., Soft-Switch Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., UnisysCorp., and 3Com Corp.andP;  In joining, each company commits to researching ordeveloping products based on the common applications environment.andP;  Coretechnology adopted by the group as a working example is the Hewlett-PackardNewWave Object Management Facility (OMF), which allows users to integrateindependently developed software applications and different types of data.andM;Interested companies may join the OMG as either corporate or associatemembers.andP;  Corporate membership, which carries voting privileges, is open toany enterprise planning to research or create commercially available softwareproducts for the applications environment.andP;  Associate membership is open toany organization involved in promoting object-oriented environments orconducting research but not selling a product for the environment.andP;  Associatemembers can be on technical panels and attend all meetings but may not vote.andM;Fees for corporate membership range from $5,000-$50,000, depending upon thesize of the company.andP;  Associate fees are $500 for individuals and $1,000 fororganizations.andP;  Members will be kept up-to-date on the consortium's progresstoward an industry-standard, object-oriented environment and will also havean opportunity to influence the group's work through technical contributions.andM;Those interested in joining should write to the Object Management Group, P.O.andO;Box 395, Westboro, Mass.andP;  01580.andM;Commercial natural languageandM;Cognitive Systems Inc. (New Haven, Conn.) signed two new contracts withAmerican corporations for AI applications software.andP;  The company will provideReader's Digest (Pleasantville, N.Y.) with an intelligent personalizedletter-writing system.andP;  This IBM mainframe software will incorporate AItechniques for automating manual processing activities and help thepublisher's customer-service representatives generate correspondence moreaccurately, quickly, and informatively.andM;Another contract for Cognitive's automated message-processing software hasbeen signed with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. (New York, N.Y.).andP;  Thesoftware relies primarily on AI techniques to process financial transactionmessages, creating significant cost efficiencies, according to the vendor.andO;Manufacturers Hanover is the sixth bank worldwide to have installed thesystem.andM;Cognitive Systems specializes in developing knowledge-based natural-languagesoftware that automates human-language-based input and is best known forATRANS, ACLASS, and TestKey Extractor--software that reads, interprets andautomatically formats financial transaction messages between banks.andP;  Thecompany is one of the first ever to offer a value-added application for theIBM 370 MVS/TSO environment using IBM's new Common LISP software.andP;  Thecompany also recently announced a contract with the Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (DARPA) to investigate CASE-Based Reasoning as an alternativeto the current rule-based paradigm for building expert systems.andM;Contact Steve Mott, President, Cognitive Systems Inc., 234 Church St., NewHaven, Conn.andP;  06510, (203) 773-0726.andM;Smalltalk/V for schoolsandM;Digitalk Inc. has begun a broad site-license and discount program for itsline of Smalltalk/V object-oriented software for the IBM PC family and AppleMacintosh environments.andP;  Under the new program, schools registered as usersof Smalltalk/V 286 for 80286 or 80386 machines or Smalltalk/V Mac for theMacintosh receive rights to install copies of the software on site for a $500site-license fee.andP;  The cost of the older Smalltalk/V version site licenseremains at $250.andM;All Smalltalk/V Extension Kits, adding such features as EGA/VGA color,communication with UNIX systems, and application building blocks, are coveredby the basic license agreement.andP;  Digitalk's companion manuals and tutorialbooks are available at a discount.andP;  In addition, any school is eligible fordiscounts ranging from 30%-50% on all Smalltalk/V products.andM;Contact Digitalk Inc. at 9841 Airport Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif.andP;  90045,(213) 645-1082.andM;New microExplorer systemsandM;Texas Instruments Inc. has expanded its microExplorer line of personal AIworkstations with more powerful systems based on the Apple Macintosh IIxcomputer.andP;  The microExplorer combines TI's Explorer LISP microprocessor andAI software environment with conventional Mac hardware and software.andP;  The MacIIx is based on the Motorola 68030 32-bit chip with a 68882 math coprocessor.andO;The microExplorer machine based on Mac has 4MB RAM of its own in addition to4MB of Mac RAM.andP;  Both can be upgraded to a total of 20MB.andP;  Hard drives from40MB-330MB and four display options are offered.andM;The new microExplorer is available immediately, starting at $16,645; thehigh-end complete development system is $32,240.andP;  Upgrades from earliersystems are also available.andM;Contact Texas Instruments Inc., Data Systems Group, P.O.
