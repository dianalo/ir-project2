That obsession seems to havebeen overcome and the fate of the hostages no longer seems to be ofgreat concern to anybody in this administration,'' she said onNBC-TV's ``Today'' show.   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, is the longest-held of 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Hewas kidnapped on March 16, 1985, in Beirut as he was returning froma tennis game.   Services to mark the third anniversary of his abduction werescheduled in Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y., as well asBuffalo and Rochester, and in California and Florida, Mrs. Say said.   In Washington, Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jacksonwas taking part at an afternoon service at Holy Trinity RomanCatholic Church where prayers for Anderson and the other hostageswere to be offered by Christian and Islamic clergy.   Participants, including three former hostages _ the Rev.Lawrence Jenco, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and ABC News correspondentCharles Glass _ were to read passages from the Bible and the Koran.   Marilyn Langston, daughter of American hostage Frank HerbertReed, said today she hopes the service ``puts an awareness ineveryone's mind that this hostage situation is going on continuallyand until they're all out we can't forget it.''   Ms. Langston said, however, that she feared the captives havebeen forgotten by the U.S. government.   ``I feel they've been put on the backburner, that the concernfor the hostages _ I don't know if there is any any more,'' Ms.Langston said on the NBC program.   Reed, director of the Lebanon International School in Beirut,was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986. He is among the nine Americans heldcaptive in Lebanon, including Thomas Sutherland, Joseph JamesCicippio, Edward Austin Tracy, Jesse Turner, Robert Polhill, AlaanSteen, and Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.</TEXT></DOC>
