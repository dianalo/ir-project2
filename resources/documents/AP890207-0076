(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Guy Hunt says the Alabama pensionsystem's purchase of a Montgomery TV station raises troubling FirstAmendment questions, and he has asked the Federal CommunicationsCommission to block the deal.   Hunt filed a petition Monday opposing the $70 million purchaseagreement for WSFA.   ``We're glad the issue is before the FCC, where it ought to be,''said Bill Stephens, an attorney for Retirement Systems of Alabama.   Monday was the deadline for petitions to be filed concerningtransfer of the license of the station.   Hunt said the state-funded agency's purchase of the dominantbroadcast news operation in the capital ``raises clear and verytroubling First Amendment issues.''   David Bronner, who manages the retirement system's $8 billionportfolio, has defended his decision to buy WSFA from CosmosBroadcasting Inc. of Greenville, S.C. He said there would be notampering with the news.   Bronner has said that the purchase is a ``done deal,'' needingonly FCC approval, and that Alabama would lose $10 million inearnest money if the state backs out.   But the governor said the deal is not final, and he asked the FCCto delay any decision until Alabama courts resolve legal issuesraised by the agreement.   The petition said the purchase would violate Alabama law barringgovernment from private enterprise and violate FCC rules by givingstate government two broadcast outlets in Montgomery, counting thestate's educational TV operation.   William Walsh, deputy secretary-treasurer of the retirementsystem, said pension program officials feel there is no conflictwith state law.   Already, he said, ``the state is involved in the whisky business,the state is in the hotel and motel business, the state runs thestate docks.'' He was referring to Alabama's state-run liquor storesand state-owned resorts.   Hunt has suggested the purchase of WSFA was concocted by Bronnerand teacher lobbyist Paul Hubbert, a major critic of Hunt'sRepublican administration.</TEXT></DOC>
