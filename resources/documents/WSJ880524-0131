The New York city bar reiterated that the agencies must be paid a fixed fee -- rather than a percentage fee -- for their services. But it said that such a fee &quot;may consider the nature of the assignment, including the reasonably predictable length of time and number of hours it would take to perform.&quot;    The bar's ruling last month barred percentage fees, and agencies feared that it might force them out of business. In the past, legal temp agencies charged a client an hourly fee for a lawyer's work -- generally $40 to $80 an hour. Then the agency kept 25% to 35%.    Under the new ruling, agencies will have to estimate how much time a lawyer's assignments will take and charge a fixed fee based on that estimate.    &quot;We are pleased that the committee has reconsidered the matter,&quot; said Lesley Friedman, owner of Special Counsel Inc., a New York-based agency. &quot;But while we're making a good faith effort to comply, we continue to believe that (the previous fee structure) didn't violate the canons of ethics.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
