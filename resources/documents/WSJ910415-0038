Complaining that the program has become chronicallyunprofitable, dozens of insurers have curtailed their Texasexposure in recent months, including American InternationalGroup Inc., the state's fourth-largest underwriter. Organizedlabor has mounted a serious legal attack on the legislativechanges, arguing they deny workers due process.</LP><TEXT>   And growing numbers of employers are abandoning the systemaltogether, often leaving their employees unprotected if theysuffer a job-related injury.   &quot;The curve {of departing employers} has been anexponential curve since October,&quot; says George E. Chapman,executive director of the Texas Workers' CompensationCommission, who is resigning to avoid a political fight overwhether he should be renominated when his term expires May31. &quot;The numbers are really spiraling.&quot;   The disarray in Texas comes at a time when several statesare struggling to salvage their workers-compensationprograms, which pay medical expenses and wages of workers whoare injured or fall ill on the job. Workers-compensationinsurers nationwide estimate that they had underwritinglosses of $5.7 billion on workers-compensation lines lastyear, as state-regulated premiums failed to keep pace withskyrocketing medical costs and lawsuit awards. In severalstates with particularly sharp imbalances, both insurers andemployers are threatening to take their business elsewhere.   It was to avoid such problems that the Texas legislaturepassed a sweeping overhaul of the workers-compensation lawsin December 1989. Under the plan, Texas created a commissionto hear most workers' claims in administrative proceedingsand determine the amount of compensation from a rating systemdeveloped by the American Medical Association. The plandiscourages lawyers' involvement in the process by limitinglegal fees, curtailing lump-sum payments of compensation, andseverely restricting workers' rights to appeal their awardsin state courts.   Although business groups hailed the new system, it cameunder immediate attack from just about everybody else. TheAFL-CIO sued to have the law declared unconstitutional,arguing, among other things, that it violates due process andequal protection provisions of the Texas Constitution. Astate judge in Eagle Pass, Texas, agreed for now, issuing atemporary injunction against implementing the system. Thestate has appealed the decision to the Texas Supreme Court, amove that renders the injunction moot, but the state stillfaces a trial on the merits of the lawsuit beginning April22.   Insurers, meanwhile, have been livid. They argue thatcompensation awards continue to be onerous, particularlybecause they still pay high claims that predate the Jan. 1,1991, implementation of the system. The insurers areespecially concerned about their growing exposure to theTexas assigned-risk pool, which covers employers who can'tget conventional coverage.   By last year, the pool had ballooned to 21% of the totalworkers-compensation market, from just 3% in 1983. And thetotal deficit, which insurers have to make up by giving thestate a cut of their premium volume, had reached more than$500 million.   To help defray such costs -- and to sidestep a rate freezebegun this year by Texas insurance regulators -- manyinsurers have been padding their premiums through surchargesand other maneuvers. But the state insurance commissionerissued a warning last week that such unauthorized increaseswere illegal.   People in the industry said the dispute has caused severallarge insurers to stop issuing new policies. And AmericanInternational Group last week said it is withdrawing from theworkers-compensation market in Texas, save for &quot;certainrisk.&quot;   David Surles, technical services director of theIndependent Insurance Agents of Texas, said the announcement&quot;very well could have a domino effect&quot; on other companies,because &quot;nobody wants to be the last carrier left in Texas.&quot;   At the same time, an increasing number of employers havedecided to take advantage of their option to do withoutworkers-compensation coverage. By some estimates, fully halfof all Texas employers have opted out of coverage, a rightgranted in just two other states. Some companies are goingwithout any insurance on the gamble that they won't be hitwith severe claims, while others are buying supplementarypolicies that assume at least some of the risk.   Michael Dodge, a Dallas attorney who advises companies whowant to leave the program, says business is brisk. &quot;It'sunbelieveable how fast it's happening,&quot; he says, adding thatthe workers-compensation system is in a &quot;meltdown.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
