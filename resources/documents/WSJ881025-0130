He suggests a dose of nuclear capacity will assist the U.S. in dealing with impending electricity shortages. In fact, the U.S. electricity crisis is not quite as dire as his diagnosis and the available treatments are more diverse.    Mr. Sillin's forecasts of 4% to 5% trend growth in electricity consumption have not been borne out in the recent past. By carefully selecting historic periods, Mr. Sillin gives the impression that 4% to 5% growth is the norm. In fact, over the past decade (1977 to 1987), electric energy growth has averaged 2.2% per annum. Business cycles and weather variation have substantial influence on year-to-year electricity consumption patterns. In fact, this past August was an incredible 18% hotter than last year. It is unlikely that next year's weather will be as severe as this year's, and brownouts in 1989 are certainly not inevitable. If one tries to adjust for weather and business cycles it is clear that trend electricity growth is probably half of what Mr. Sillin suggests.    By the year 1992 more than one-fifth of U.S. electric generation is expected to come from nuclear resources. Oil is expected to generate only 5% of U.S. electricity output, down from 17% in 1973. Thus, over the next decade, the electric utility industry will have greater fuel diversity than in the past and also will have generating capability more in balance with demand requirements. Current nuclear capacity will continue to provide significant fuel diversity into the post-2010 era.    Surplus electric-generating capacity will disappear in only a few areas of the U.S. by the early 1990s. These areas are New England, Florida, Long Island and Southern California. Even with 2% to 3% growth, electricity shortages are expected in these areas of the country. With the reforms Mr. Sillin advocates, nuclear construction planning horizons are still in the 10-year range. In reality, the nuclear option is technically and politically precluded from meeting capacity needs over the next decade. As a matter of policy, the U.S. can certainly tolerate a dose of combined-cycle natural-gas units, oil-fired combustion turbines, refurbishment of existing units, nonutility generators, conservation programs and coal-gasification technologies.    Surely, our regulatory system is flawed by allowing $5 billion to be invested in a nuclear plant before local community veto power is exercised. However, nuclear policy need not be set in a crisis environment. A well-thought-out nuclear policy is needed to address the issues of nuclear-plant refurbishment and construction in the post-2010 period.    As a country, we can back off nuclear power in the next decade and concentrate on resolving the political conflict surrounding nuclear technology. Nuclear-policy reform needs time to evolve, and the real nuclear choice lies 20 years away. Near-term electricity shortages should not be confused with nuclear-policy reform. Current energy ills need short-term non-nuclear solutions.    Larry Makovich   Senior Economist   DRI/McGraw-Hill   Lexington, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
