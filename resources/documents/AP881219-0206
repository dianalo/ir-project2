Yesterday, the last day of 1988, flipped over to 1989 today andthe last march of the nines began. Next year, a nine will move over,be replaced by a zero and the total will read 1990.   And before we know it, in the steadily rising speed of subjectivetime, there will be three nines and then the days will roll up andout and the weeks will roll up and out and the months will roll upand out and finally, in a single moment of breathless magic, a zerowill come up for the year, another zero for the decade, a third zerofor the century and, with one to carry, to be carried oh socarefully, we will have a whole new millennium in the life ofhumankind.   There, in the big roll of nines and zeros, will come the ultimatefor lovers of symmetrical milestones: the first day of a new year, anew decade, a new century, a new millennium. It is a calendarcombination prophets and prognosticators can't resist. They arealready busy.   In their latest crystal balls, they see a century in which thedeaf will hear and the lame will walk; most Americans will bedescended from non-Europeans; more than four million new jobs willhave to be found for people replaced by robots that never tire, eat,get paid or join unions.   They see a time when the life span will be stretched to 150 yearsand the divorce rate will zoom because who can look at the samehusband for more than 100 years? A time when computer networks willmatch a liver donor in Duluth with a patient in Dusseldorf. Whenbusinessmen conferring by television continents apart will be ableto see each other, talk, sell, argue, exchange contracts and babypictures. When cars will be fully computerized and, after centuriesof frustration by horse, camel and raft, a man finally will be ableto answer the eternal question, ``Daddy, when will we be there?''   A time of scary scientific discovery, especially in geneticengineering, when society will have to deal with the questions ofwhether man is ready to play God and is God ready to let him.   Who will prevail among the soothsayers, the prophets of a brightnew world or the seers of doom and gloom? In that trade, historyindicates that the optimists and the pessimists run aboutneck-and-neck.   So far, the meek have not inherited the earth. But neither hasBig Brother. The year 1984 came and went without ``1984,'' the grimscenario of an ultra-totalitarian state by George Orwell. Freedomstirs in China. Mikhail Gorbachev sits in Stalin's office in Moscow.   The world has not exploded in a nuclear Armageddon, and theplanet is alive, if not well. The 20th century has improved thehealth of humans more than all the previous centuries combined, butit has not been kind to the planet. Unlike all the centuries thatpassed before, the 21st will inherit tons of man-made nuclear wasteswhich will remain dangerously radioactive for 280,000 years.   A hundred years ago, the prophets were predicting that technologywould cure most of society's ills. Now they're wondering how societywill survive technology.   In the hot summer of 1988, the experts warned that a severe``greenhouse effect'' may be awaiting us in the next century, thatcarbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere from the vast burning of oiland coal below could heat the earth, melt glaciers, raise sealevels, parch the middle of the globe and produce bumper crops inCanada and Siberia.   In the same hot summer of 1988, Ronald Reagan and MikhailGorbachev told us in Moscow that their two governments and otherswould try to plan cooperatively for changes in climate. Could itcome to pass that the Cold War may one day end because thesuperpowers will fear the changing earth more than each other?   No area of human prophecy has produced worse batting averagesthan the question of war or peace. The most recent to step up to theplate was Edward C. Aldridge, Air Force secretary. Unveiling the newstealth bomber, he predicted, ``We are ushering in a new age ofstrategic deterrence.''   About 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson thought that submarines,when invented, would prove so devastating they would prevent wars.Victor Hugo, in 1842, predicted balloons would end war. So, by turn,would the machine gun, the tank, the airplane and the atom bomb.   Humans will live very differently but human nature is likely toremain, as it has since the cave man, unchanged and ``unevolving,''notes Timothy Willard, editor of The Futurist Magazine. ``Humanability to solve problems has improved but human ingenuity willcontinue to embrace both the constructive and destructive.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
