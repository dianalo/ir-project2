The concentrations in plantsincreased considerably after the Chernobyl accident, mainly due to directabsorption of isotopes through the leaves. In milk the highest radiostrontiumconcentration of 29Bq/1 was observed in May. The activity of undergroundwaters was not changed noticeably. As for soil the increased activitywas ascribed mostly to Sr-89. (author) 5 refs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
