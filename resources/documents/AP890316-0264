(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shenanigans of television evangelists suchas Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker have spawned another player inAmerica's multimillion-dollar board game industry, named ``Fleecethe Flock.''   The game, scheduled to be in stores next month, is marketed byRegent Continental, a Philadelphia-based company that produces boardgames for some of the nation's largest toy makers, including``Monopoly,'' ``Clue,'' and ``Sorry'' for Parker Brothers.   ``I came up with the idea when Jimmy Swaggart was caught in themotel,'' said Elizabeth Fuller, author of ``My Search for the Ghostof Flight 401'' and other books. ``I thought, `These guys belong ona board game.'''   ``Fleece the Flock'' is based loosely on ``Monopoly,'' butinstead of real-estate tycoons, players assume the roles of greedyevangelists.   Armed with collection plates, players toss dice and seekownership of theme parks, television stations and record companieswhile trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their ownsexual escapades secret.   Fuller, who lives in Weston, Conn. collaborated on the game withinventor Stanley Mason of Weston, whose 30 patents include Masonwaremicrowave cookware, and Roy Doty of Norwalk, Conn., a humorillustrator whose work has appeared in Newsweek, Fortune and PopularScience magazines.   The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions for this venture andsold the rights to market the game to Regent.   The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at$25 retail, available by April 1, said Cindy Levinson, the Regentaccount executive who is marketing ``Fleece the Flock.''   The company will focus its sales campaign on the Northeast atfirst, but hopes to convince nationwide chains to carry the game,she said.   ``Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalizeon people in the news. Milton Bradley, maker of the some of thecountry's most popular games, last month unveiled ``Trump TheGame,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estatemogul Donald Trump.   Analysts say any new entry into the $760 million-a-yearboard-game industry faces an uphill battle.   ``More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do notmake it past that year's Christmas,'' said David S. Leibowitz, a toyindustry analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York. ``Thesuccess of any new toy item is pretty tough.   ``Board games tend to have a more difficult time than many otherproducts because there is a set of rules to be mastered, and thecompetition is far keener because many people believe they can infact create a board game.''   Board games face additional difficulties of requiring more thanone person and a considerable block of time to play, he said.   But Fuller and her collaborators say they are confident thatAmericans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles oftelevision evangelists will create a niche for their game.   ``The No. 1 one thing the American public is interested in rightnow are TV evangelists gone astray _ not movie stars, not rockstars,'' Fuller said.   The three spent five months testing the game on groups ofvolunteer players, who were observed at Mason's product developmentlaboratory in Weston.   They went through nine versions of the board and even morechanges in the rules, which come in the form of the TenCommandments, before settling on the final version.   The inventors were dumbfounded to discover one common trait amongthe test players: They all were cheating by the end of the game. Thephenomenon prompted the inclusion of one rule that is assumed inmost games: ``Thou shalt not cheat (unless thou canst get away withit).''   No real-life evangelist is named in the game and the inventorsinsist they are not attacking religion itself. Fuller is aUnitarian; Doty and Mason are Methodists.   ``It's a comment on humanity,'' Mason said. ``It's aimed at thehuman foibles we have, when we'll suppport people like this when weknow...they are evil.''
