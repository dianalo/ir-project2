Blaming 1982 federal deregulation that allowed thrifts to broadenactivities from home loans to real estate development and otherrisky ventures, the book says fraud and not economic problems suchas the Texas oil bust were at the root of the crisis.   ``Deregulation was the best thing to happen to the mob sinceProhibition,'' said book co-author Stephen Pizzo, a reporter forNational Thrift News. ``They were watching this right from thestart.''   He added: ``You take fraud out of the equation and there probablywould have been no savings and loan crisis.''   The book cites Sandamp;L frauds with links to the five big New York mobfamilies _Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese, Bonnano and Colombo _ as wellas the Civella family in Kansas City, Peter Milano gang in LosAngeles and Carlos Marcello in New Orleans.   Pizzo estimated that organized crime figures were involved inabout 20 percent of savings and loan frauds since 1982.   ``The thrift mess cannot be described as primarily related toorganized crime,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a House BankingCommittee member who has read the book. ``Yet the organized crimeelement is real and has to date been badly underestimated.''   The government has taken over close to 500 thrifts in the lasttwo years. The 10-year cost of bailing out ailing thrifts is $159billion under legislation signed last month by President Bush.   ``Inside Job'' also names Las Vegas casino owners, thrift depositbrokers and a former mob stockbroker who received a new name aftertestifying against other organized crime figures but re-emerged as amajor Sandamp;L swindler.   ``The evidence was overwhelming that the Mafia was activelylooting Sandamp;Ls _ in various widely disparate locations, at the sametime, in the same ways, often using the same people,'' the authorswrite.   The book, to be published by McGraw-Hill this month, was writtenby Pizzo, National Thrift News reporter Paul Muolo and Mary Fricker,an editorial writer for the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat.   Among its other charges:   _Federal Home Loan Bank Board regulators repeatedly failed tocontact the Justice Department about possibly starting criminalinvestigations of frauds and then refused to share information onSandamp;L frauds. It also says that federal officials repeatedly deniedknowing of any mob connections to Sandamp;L frauds.   _Top FHLBB officials delayed implementing supervision for somethrifts that eventually collapsed.   _Political intervention by several congressmen and senators whohad received donations from thrift executives ``significantly sloweddown regulatory response to this looting.''   William Fulwider, a spokesman for the Treasury Department'sOffice of Thrift Supervision, which replaced the bank board, said:``They're not the first and probably won't be the last to criticizewhat we've done here.''   ``The staff made what it felt were the best decisions for theindustry and (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) and theboard acted accordingly,'' he said. ``I think there's an awful lotof trying to find a simple answer to all the problems of the thriftindustry.''   The authors said their investigation began three years ago afterPizzo uncovered names of mob-related figures in the collapse ofCentennial Savings andamp; Loan of Santa Rosa. Officials there have beenindicted for money laundering.   ``This looting of savings and loans was done by a network ofpeople who knew each other,'' Fricker said. ``It's not justsomething that happened in individual towns around the country.''</TEXT></DOC>
