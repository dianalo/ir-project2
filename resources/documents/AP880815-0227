The over-calculation of the size of next year's deficit waspointed out to congressional aides in the last few days by theagency that committed it _ the White House's Office of Managementand Budget.   OMB officials confirmed this past week that the mistake had beenmade, and said they had told congressional staff members about it.   As the $1.1 trillion federal budget goes, $1.2 billion normallywould barely register a tick.   But the amount is significant because it means that Congresswill have to squeeze spending for anti-drug programs, the homeless,the hungry and other popular causes under a $1.8 billion ceiling,rather than what should be a $3 billion limit.</TEXT><DATELINE>PAHUTE MESA, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. and Soviet scientists, ignoring adiplomatic gaffe half a world away, are conducting rehearsals forthis week's historic nuclear experiment that will mark a milestonein the atomic age.   Wednesday's test blast comes nearly four years after PresidentReagan first proposed such a project during a speech to the UnitedNations.   The joint verification experiment is designed to measure eachcountry's ability to monitor the size of the other's test.Verification could lead to ratification of treaties limiting thesize of nuclear tests, which were signed in the 1974 and 1976 butnever ratified.   Scientists from the United States and the Soviet Union will bemeasuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device encased ina steel canister buried 2,050 feet beneath a picturesque mesa, 130miles northwest of Las Vegas.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citing the potential of terrorist attack,members of Congress are putting the Reagan administration on noticethat they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment ofplutonium from Europe to Japan.   ``Here you have an administration that is supposedly waging awar on terrorism, but promoting a policy that could make terrorismeasy,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., a member of the HouseForeign Affairs Committee.   The issue stems from a recently signed U.S.-Japan nuclearcooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutoniumfrom reprocessing plants in Europe back to Japan, where it will beused to fuel nuclear power plants.   The plutonium, which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons,is controlled by the U.S. government because the nuclear fueloriginated in the United States.   Proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upondevelopment of crash-proof shipping casks, which so far has provenunachievable.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   College students reduced their drinking more iftheir assumptions about alcohol's benefits were challenged than ifthey were warned about its dangers, psychologists say.   ``We're looking at this as an approach to prevention'' ofproblem drinking, said researcher Renelle Massey of the Universityof South Florida at Tampa.   Study results support a theory that one reason people drink isbecause they think it will make them funny, brave, more sociable,sexier, more assertive or better in some other way, she said.   Levels of such ``expectancies'' have been linked to alcoholconsumption in previous studies, she said in an interview Sunday atthe American Psychological Association's annual meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
