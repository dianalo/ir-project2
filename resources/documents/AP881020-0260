The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, jumped 79 cents Wednesday to close at $15.40 a42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Tuesday,the November contract plunged 60 cents.   The wide price swings reflected traders' alternating optimismand pessimism in advance of meetings of the OPEC strategy andpricing committees to begin today in Madrid, Spain.   Overproduction by the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries sent the price of oil skidding below the$12.30-a-barrel mark recently. Hopes of an agreement to rein inproduction brought prices back up in the past two weeks.   Prices surged Wednesday ``on the anticipation of somethingpositive coming out of this meeting,'' said Jim Colburn, a brokerat E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc.   Colburn said traders bought heavily Wednesday after the Kuwaitioil minister said his country would agree to abide by its OPECproduction quota if the cartel's other members also agreed torespect their individual ceilings.   Over the weekend, oil ministers of the six-nation GulfCooperation Council met and proposed an overall OPEC productionceiling of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day. The cartel'sdaily output is now estimated at more than 21 million barrels.   The GCC proposal was expected to be presented to the two OPECcommittees.   Colburn said oil trading was expected to remain volatile incoming weeks. OPEC has scheduled a full ministerial meeting on Nov.21.   Refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange also weresharply higher Wednesday. The November contract for wholesaleunleaded gasoline rose 2.14 cents to settle at 49.06 cents agallon, and the November contract for home heating oil picked up1.56 cents to close at 43.85 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
