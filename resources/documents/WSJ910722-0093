Butit's not clear whether buyers are willing yet to pay the tab.   Major steelmakers announced increases early this month,raising base prices 4% on steel sheet, which is used to makesuch mass-production items as automobiles and appliances.Aluminum makers soon followed with similar increases, and inrecent days some resin, chemical and paper companies alsohave posted higher prices.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The economy has begun to recover, volume is increasing ina number of markets, and that's being reflected in somepricing,&quot; says Reynolds Metals Co. corporate economist LloydT. O'Carroll.   Still, inflation foes needn't panic: Many manufacturers,particularly makers of automotive parts, say their pricescontinue to move lower. And it's not clear whether producersseeking price boosts can make them stick. Although orders inbasic industry have begun to pick up and inventories remainlean, prices remain at historic lows and many manufacturerscontinue to discount.   &quot;Several industries have been discounting like mad, sothey're trying to signal to customers and competitors thatthey ought to knock off the discounting,&quot; says Adrian T.Dillon, an economist who is vice president for planning atEaton Corp., a Cleveland-based automotive supplier. But hedismisses the price moves as a &quot;short-term blip&quot; due toisolated shortages and says, &quot;There's no incipient inflationin the manufacturing sector.&quot;   Such doubts didn't stop Barmet Aluminum Corp. In earlyApril, the Akron, Ohio, company found orders growing for itsgutters, spouts and siding used in construction. &quot;It justkept growing and growing until our backlog was up 30% or40%,&quot; says marketing manager Harry Graham. So this month,Barmet boosted prices 4% to 6%. A week later, Reynolds, oneof the big players in the industry, matched the increase.Major aluminum companies, including Aluminum Co. of Americaand Maxxam Inc.'s Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical unit, alsoraised extrusion prices by about 3% to 5% in recent days.   Barmet says it hasn't lost any business yet, though Mr.Graham says he doubts that all the company's rivals willadopt the higher prices. Aluminum ingot is trading at halfthe price level it reached last fall and its lowest level onan adjusted basis in two decades.   The outlook for steelmakers' attempted price increase iseven murkier. Just days after LTV Corp.'s LTV Steel Co. andUSX Corp. announced 5% price increases, Bethlehem Steel Corp.said it would only raise prices 4%. That forced competitorsto scale down their increase and sent a signal to customersthat discounting might continue.   Others may fare better. Mead Corp., a Dayton, Ohio, papermaker, raised prices about 5% July 1 for its coatedpaperboard used for folding boxes, even though pulp pricesremain depressed. It plans a similar increase on itsbeverage-container paper board. On July 8, Mead raised prices6% for its uncoated paper used by businesses -- a productthat has been selling at its lowest level in years. Mead saysrivals have done the same.   The same day Mead raised paper prices, Akron-based B.F.Goodrich Co. boosted prices 3% for its vinyl resins used tomanufacture plastics. But plastics makers haven't yetreflected the higher costs in their prices. Plastics makerM.A. Hanna Co. hasn't raised prices, though it says its pricecuts have leveled off. Ferro Corp. hasn't seen anyimprovement in plastics prices either. It has won modestincreases in its chemical prices, though it isn't confidentthe higher levels will hold. (Industry leader Du Pont Co.says basic chemical prices have been relatively stable overthe past year.)   A. Schulman Inc., another plastics maker, detects a changein mood in the industry after months of falling prices. &quot;Itappears inventories are very low, and ordering is on a day today basis,&quot; says Chairman Robert A. Stefanko.   Still, some industries are likely to be passed over inthis round of price increases. Automotive suppliers say theirprices are still falling, largely because of concessionsdemanded by automakers.   General Motors Corp., for example, has told its suppliersto cut prices by 3% this year and 2% in each of the next twoyears. GenCorp Inc., an automotive and aerospace supplier,says prices are still heading downward. Brush Wellman Inc.,which supplies beryllium metal and alloys to the automotive,defense and computer industries, sees no improvement inorders or pricing.   Tire makers, plagued by overcapacity and price wars, havenevertheless tried some price increases. Goodyear Tire andamp;Rubber Co. raised its prices 4% to 6% May 1. ButBridgestone/Firestone Inc., which has tried three increasesthis year, says some attempts have already fallen throughbecause of discounting.   Others say they have been thwarted by competition eventhough economic conditions might justify price increases.Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams Co., which makes paints andcoatings, says competition has prevented it from raisingprices even though sales have grown and material costs areclimbing. PPG Industries Inc., a big rival in paints andcoatings, declined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
