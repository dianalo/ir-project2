Translating can be an expensive and time-consuming task for manyJapanese companies, especially those whose products are primarilyaimed at foreign markets.   One answer, says Fujitsu, a major computer manufacturer, is itscomputer-aided translation system, first marketed in 1984 and nowbeing upgraded.   ``In every company, piles of documents are just waiting to betranslated,'' Shigeru Sato, a director at Fujitsu Laboratory, said.``A need is felt to speed up information exchanges on a globalbasis.''   Sato said Fujitsu's $30,000 Automatic Translation System, orAtlas, can translate Japanese documents into English about 30percent faster than average human translators.   ``We are hoping to increase the efficiency of translation up to50 percent in three years,'' said Hiroshi Uchida, a systemsengineer for Fujitsu.   If that improvement is achieved, said John Mackin, a manager atFujitsu's documentation department, which uses the Atlas system,``we can get rid of the bottom half of low-quality translators.That will increase the quality of translation drastically whilecutting costs.''   Sato said Fujitsu also has developed a verbal translation systemthat translates spoken Japanese into English and vice versa.   The system is a combination of Atlas and a voice recognitionsystem. If the latter recognizes a sentence in Japanese, itconverts the sentence into written Japanese and sends it to theAtlas, which translates it to English, and a voicing system readsthe sentence in a synthetic voice.   Sato acknowledged, however, that many difficulties lie aheadbefore a complete computer translation system is achieved.   ``The most difficult part was setting up a sufficientdictionary,'' he said. The dictionary requires not only word byword translation but also syntax, semantics, and contexttranslation, he said.   For example, he said, the dictionary has to be able todifferentiate such sentences as ``I saw a bird with a telescope''and ``I saw a bird with a ring.''   ``The two may have the same grammatical structure but adifferent usage,'' Sato said.   Structural differences between Japanese and English also pose avariety of problems, Sato said.   ``In Japanese,'' he said, ``sentences seldom have a subject andstill can be understood.'' However, English sentences must have asubject.''   Also, Japanese sentences are often vague about singularity andplurality of nouns, which must be stated clearly in English, hesaid.   The Atlas system at this stage of development does not helpreduce the number of translators companies need because ``it takeshighly trained translators to use Atlas correctly,'' said Mackin.   Under the guidance and sponsorship of the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry, eight Japanese computermanufacturers, including Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd. andToshiba Corp., are jointly developing a complete dictionary systemthat contains 200,000 words in both Japanese and English plus100,000 special words.   The ministry is investing $1.05 billion in the six-year project,Sato said.   Fujitsu's Sato said his company is the world's leader incomputer-aided translation and the only prospective rival at thispoint would be Hitachi.   He said Fujitsu has delivered to Japanese customers about 100units of its Atlas system while Hitachi, Toshiba and NEC have soldonly 10 units altogether.   He also said U.S. and European companies are behind Fujitsu inthis field because of less demand for Japanese-English translationof documents and instruction manuals in the United States andEurope.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions July 23-24</NOTE></DOC>
