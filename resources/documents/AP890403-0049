In the occupied territories, soldiers shot and killed a20-year-old Palestinian during a riot at the Amari refugee camp inthe West Bank.   Officials at Ramallah Hospital said Mohammed Ismail Baba sufferda gunshot wound in the chest and was dead on arrival at thehospital. The army confirmed the death and said it wasinvestigating.   Arab hospital sources said at least eight Palestinians werewounded by troops in scattered clashes in the Gaza Strip Nusseiratrefugee camp and in the West Bank towns of Hebron, El-Bireh andRamallah. The military confirmed one Palestinian was wounded andsaid it was checking further.   At least 419 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed inthe 16-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.   A children's advocacy group said a 10-year-old Gaza Strip boydetained for throwing stones was held for two weeks in March,although Israel's age of criminal responsibility is 12. Eitan Haberof the Defense Ministry said he was checking the report.   Judge Edna Bekenstein of the district court in Netanya gaveClaudio Nutkiewicz the suspended sentence and fined him 1,000shekels (about $555) for entering the Balata camp in West Bank inDecember 1987, the photographer said.   He said the judge told him he violated a 1970 law thatdesignates all refugee camps as closed military areas. He and otherjournalists said the decision could hamper coverage of the occupiedterritories, where a Palestinian uprising began 16 months ago.   An army spokesman said paragraph 90-A of the 1970 law allows themilitary to declare any refugee camp closed if the authorities deemit necessary for operational reasons, ``but it is certainly notautomatic.''   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, journalists have enteredrefugee camps freely unless the camps were under curfew or specificclosure orders.   Army officers are allowed to declare areas closed and ban newscoverage during times of violent unrest. The army requires officerswho do so to show journalists a paper defining the closed areas.   Robert Slater, chairman of the Foreign Press Association, saidhe was not aware of the law Nutkiewicz said the judge cited.   ``I hope this will not affect press coverage,'' he said, notingthat Nutkiewicz was the first journalist covering the uprising tobe convicted of violations connected with his work.   The Argentine-born Israeli, who works for the Images photoagency, said he and other journalists entered Balata to cover awomen's demonstration and no one told him it was a closed area. Hewas detained briefly that day.   In another press development Monday, Israeli journalists saidthey would boycott activities of Jewish settlers in the West Bankuntil the settlers stop placing fake ``Press'' signs in their carwindows.   Reporters said the phony signs make press identification uselessas a protection from Arab protesters, who usually let journalistspass unharmed.   ``Today, they impersonate the press; tomorrow they'll pose asambulance drivers,'' said Roni Shaked of the Israeli JournalistsUnion, who reports for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.   ``The settlers think (the signs) will help, but the result willbe that the Arabs will stone both of us and in the end democracywill suffer,'' Shaked said on Israel radio.   Yitzhak Kadman, director of the independent National Council forthe Child, said he sent a letter to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabinprotesting detention of the 10-year-old Palestinian. He said theparents were not told their son was in army custody in Gaza.   An army spokesman said the child was detained for throwingstones and told soldiers he was 12. Kadman said the boy told thetroopers repeatedly he was 10.   According to Kadman, the child was walking to his uncle's homein the Rafah refugee camp when soldiers in pursuit ofstone-throwing youths grabbed him. The boy was held in Gazadetention centers for two weeks and was released March 9, he said.   ``Even if he was over 12, it is inconceivable that they did notlet the parents know their son was being held,'' Kadman said.</TEXT></DOC>
