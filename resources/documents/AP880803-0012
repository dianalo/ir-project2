(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inmates who took five guards hostage at amaximum-security prison for more than 14 hours were angry ``kids''who really didn't know what they were getting into, according tothe state prisons chief.   The small group of prisoners who took control of the 32-inmatespecial disciplinary housing unit at Coxsackie CorrectionalFacility on Monday released the last four of the five injuredguards early Tuesday.   ``I think they got tired,'' said state Corrections CommissionerThomas Coughlin of the inmates's surrender.   ``I think they felt very strongly that they were in over theirheads after the initial assaults. ... We just sat back and waitedand kept talking to them and kept giving them their options.''   Coughlin said the ordeal was ``15 hours of terror'' for theguards, some of who were apparently beaten. Two were hospitalizedin good condition Tuesday; three others were treated and releasedfor minor injuries. One inmate received minor injuries in thetakeover.   Coughlin and Gov. Mario Cuomo told news conference they believedthe takeover was an unorganized chain of events that might havebeen triggered by the heat. Temperatures on Monday were in the 90s.   ``What we're dealing with is a mob,'' Coughlin said. ``It was abunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32. There was noplanning, there was no organization. They knocked an officer down,they took two other officers' nightsticks and they said, `Oh myGod! Look what we've done now!'''   The inmates were armed with nightsticks, but didn't havehomemade knives as some believed Monday, Coughlin said.   According to state Corrections Department records, the oldestinmate in the unit is 26 years old and most of the prisoners are intheir upper teens or early 20s.   Outside the prison Monday, guard Ralph Scott had said inmateshad been warning for weeks that there might be trouble. ButCoughlin said Tuesday that none of the usually reliable troublesigns were evident at the prison, which has 951 inmates and is 20miles south of Albany.   ``The indicators that I judge were not there,'' Coughlin said.``Sure, people were saying it was getting tense. Prisons are tensein hot weather.''   Corrections Department spokesman James Flateau said Monday thatsome inmates had been complaining about verbal harassment byguards, but Cuomo said Tuesday the uprising was not a response toany harassment.   Cuomo and Coughlin said there were no demands made during theday-long negotiations, which were mostly between two inmates andprison Superintendent John Twomey. Cuomo said the inmates had onlyrequested that they not be beaten up when they released theirhostages.   All the inmates remained locked in their cells Tuesday, Flateausaid. Investigators still haven't determined how many of the 32inmates were involved in the uprising and no charges have beenfiled yet, Coughlin said.   The uprising was the longest at a New York state prison sinceinmates at Sing Sing held 17 guards hostage for 2{ days in January1983.</TEXT></DOC>
