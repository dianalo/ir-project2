Hamilton Jr., former chief executive of ITT Corp., to headits emerging flat-panel display business.   Alpine, which had revenue of $5 million for the ninemonths ended Jan. 31, has been posting losses in recentyears. It recently sold its other main business, GeneralPlasma Inc., a coatings-system company, for $12 million, andplans to concentrate on flat-panel displays, used to producehigh resolution electronic displays on signs and computers.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hamilton, 65 years old, was named to the newly createdpositions of president and chief executive for thePoly-Vision unit, which is developing the flat-paneltechnology. Starting in late 1989, he served for a time asinterim president and chief executive officer of ImperialCorp. of America, a bank holding company that filed forbankruptcy-law protection when its principal unit was takeninto conservatorship.   Steven S. Elbaum, chairman and chief executive of AlpineGroup, said Mr. Hamilton's experience will help the companybring its technology to commercial status. &quot;He will provide alot of global experience helpful in our attempt to penetrateglobal markets.&quot; He added that Mr. Hamilton, whom he knowspersonally, would receive a &quot;substantial inducement&quot; incompany equity to join Alpine.   Mr. Hamilton, who spent 17 years at ITT, acknowledged themove is something of new venture for him, since he lacksexperience in flat-display technology. But he added, &quot;I'venever seen a technology which had as many possible uses,&quot; --declaring that some products will be ready to take to marketwithin months.   But on a larger scale, many believe the international racefor dominance in the flat-panel display market has alreadybeen won by Japan. &quot;We consider Alpine one of the playersthat is trying to bring the U.S. into flat-panel technology.But when we talk about force, there's no force outside of theJapanese,&quot; said Timothy Bajarin, executive vice president ofCreative Strategies Inc., a high-tech research firm in SantaClara, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
