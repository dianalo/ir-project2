As very often happens in this world, anew idea, a new approach, is tried somewhere, and in the process, all kindsof side effects begin taking place elsewhere in the world.andP;  That is certainlythe case with Europe 1992.andM;We in Europe started the movement toward 1992 and suddenly in the UnitedStates, there is talk about Fortress Europe.andP;  Moreover, we detect a certainemotional attitude towards foreign ownership.andP;  Now, obviously, thesedevelopments are related.andP;  That is why, instead of dedicating (this) lectureonly to Europe 1992, I think it is worthwhile to bring some of these otherelements into the picture as well because they have a strong bearing onglobal trade and other global issues.andM;With regard to the origins of Europe 1992 most of you know that in 1957 wesigned the Treaty of Rome, with six members.andP;  Briefly, the main reasons wererelated to agriculture and steel.andP;  There was a desire to cut throughagricultural arrangements and to do something about the steel and coalsituation which demanded that there be some kind of supra-national policy.andM;Europe, of course, is enormously complex.andP;  We have 12 countries that aremembers of the European Common Market, we have 10 cultures, we speak ninelanguages, and we have no fewer that 12 different currencies.andP;  You know theystory about the currencies.andP;  Suppose you go to Europe with $500 in yourpocket.andP;  As you go to each country you would change the money into thecurrency of the country, and when you leave, you change to the next country.andO;Finally, after not having spent a penny, you will have only $150 left.andP;  Inanother example, if you wanted to be a certified chartered accountant in eachEuropean country, you would have to study 50 years.andM;We have a dozen separate markets averaging some 25 million people each.andP;  Weare separated by borders, border controls, border taxes, border subsidies,nationlistic policies, and protected industries.andP;  By the end of the 1970s, wehad a pretty bad economic situation in Europe, with very high unemployment,and the Common Market was not making much progress.andP;  We were said to besuffering from &quot;eurosclerosis.&quot;andP;  It was a very negative attitude.andP;  Then, atthe beginning of the 1980s, private enterprise took the lead and said, &quot;Weneed a new initiative, we need a new way to work.&quot;andM;It was Dr. Dekker who said, &quot;Look, what should we do to get Europe going, toform a really homogeneous, barrier-free market out of Europe?&quot;andP;  And that ishow it started.andP;  At that time this plan was called Europe 1990.andP;  Brusselsthought it might take two more years, and that is why it became Europe 1992.andO;The Commission in Brussels, and many of the national governments, took thisas a stimulus--and they managed to excite the interest of the people in mostEuropean countries.andM;Why did the private sector welcome the 1992 initiative?andP;  European industry isvery much in favor of this development because it is going to save us a lotof money.andP;  We have calculated that our overall costs will be reduced by about10 percent.andP;  We have calculated the cost of non-Europe is somewhere in thearea of $75 billion a year, resulting from inefficient national procurementpolicies, lack of competitiveness, and the like, across all Europe.andM;Companies already established in Europe are going to benefit significantly.andO;Ford has announced an investment program of $17 billion for the next fiveyears.andP;  IBM, DEC, Westinghouse, and General Motors have been there for many,many years.andP;  They were required to compete in the same way as Europeancompanies such as Philips.andP;  Also, quite a few American companies have decidednow that this is becoming a less complex environment, they will set up shopand play a role in this very prosperous and steadily growing market.andP;  You mayknow that Philips and ATandamp;T entered into a joint venture four or five yearsago.andP;  ATandamp;T also wants to get into Europe because the only way to do businessin a major way is to be there, to play a role.andP;  So, that is what we believeis going to happen: companies will find a much more pleasant and efficientenvironment than before.andM;In the period 1975-1980, the two major foreign direct investors in the worldwere the U.S.andP;  and Europe.andP;  In the next five-year period, America'sinvestments declined, and European investments grew.andP;  The big period of U.S.andO;direct investment was the 1950s and the 1960s, especially in europe, in thecontext of The Marshall Plan program.andP;  Enormous progress was made by the U.S.andO;in Europe in those years.andP;  At the same time, Japan was playing only a minorrole in foreign direct investment in Europe and the rest of the world,largely in underdeveloped countries.andP;  The picture that emerges is awell-developed two-way street between Europe and the U.S., a well-developedinvestment balance.andP;  With Japan, the balance is not there--it is a lopsidedsituation.andM;In 1988, total U.S.andP;  investment abroad was something on the order of $330billion, while foreign investment in the U.S.andP;  was about $304 billion.andP;  Thus,although the U.S.andP;  still holds more investment outside the U.S.andP;  thanforeigners have in the U.S., the gap is closing.andP;  That has to do with theweak dollar, among other things, which invites more people to invest in theU.S.andM;Where did these U.S.andP;  investments go?andP;  Canada, of course, is a very bigresource for this country, as are the U.K., Latin America, and Holland.andO;Investing in Japan, on the other hand, is apparently difficult, but let's notrub it in!andM;Who is investing in the United States?andP;  As on 1988, the total cumulativeinvestment--$304 billion--the biggest is the U.K., with something like $88billion, and number 2--surprise, surprise--is Holland, a pretty smallcountry, yet for many reasons a country where some very big multinationalsare established.andP;  Notice, however, that in 1988 the sharpest growth offoreign investment in the U.S.andP;  comes from Japan.andP;  In fact, Japan's directinvestments in the U.S.andP;  more than doubled in 1988.andM;What about the balance of trade?andP;  Japan has an enormous surplus, while theU.S.andP;  has an enormous deficit.andP;  Europe has a minor surplus, but that mainlyconsists of a big deficit with Japan, and a surplus with the rest of theworld.andM;Now, to come back a moment to Europe, what do we have to do to achieve allthe things I have said from the beginning?andP;  It sounds easy.andP;  Should we go fora European Central Bank?andP;  That is an interesting issue.andP;  European currency?andO;quality?andP;  What do we do about reciprocity?andP;  What should we do about oursocial policy in Europe?andP;  You can imagine that in Holland, for instance,where social benefits are very good, that people are afraid that any changein the system may diminish benefits as they are today.andP;  A basic problem iswhat shall we do about fiscal policies?andP;  Added value tax?andP;  As it is beingused all over Europe?andP;  how much of your national sovereignty are you willingto give up to accept a homogenous and united Europe?andP;  A Central Bank is thebest example.andP;  If you accept a united Europe you have to give up some of yourown independence.andM;Another interesting subject is antitrust legislation which varies fromcountry to country.andP;  Three years ago, General Electric was not allowed to buyPlessy because of a business monopolies policy.andP;  One year later, Alcatel wasallowed to buy ITT.andP;  Why?andP;  Because of the differences in policy betweenEngland and Brussels.andP;  Now an effort is being made to come to one type oflegislation, one type of regulation, for these kinds of situations.andM;Obviously, the European Market today, taken country by country, representsenormous complexity, and, at the same time, tremendous capabilities.andP;  Alsoobviously, Europe has many obstacles to overcome.andP;  In the search forsolutions, there is agreement in principle, but as I mentioned there are someproblems that are really tricky.andP;  Of course, it can not be expected that onthe first of January 1993, all that must be done will be done.andM;The important (aspect) is that the spirit of the wholething--integration--will be sorted out.andP;  But the spirit is there, of course.andO;We will be seeing a lot of political compromise, but I believe that Europe atthe beginning of the 1990s will be a different place for business.andP;  There isno doubt about it.andM;One thing I have not mentioned is the issue of nationalism.andP;  There has alwaysbeen a lot of nationalism in the policies of the European countries.andP;  Eachcountry has its &quot;national champions.c  We call them that because outsidetheir country, they cannot compete all that well.andP;  This system of nationalchampions, along with nationalistic protection, will have toi be dismantled.andM;As a result of the changes now taking place in the European community, we arehearing all kinds of talk around the world...talk about fair trade...talkabout protectionism...talk about...a European Fortress.andP;  And, now I detectanother kind of talk--an emotional discussion about foreign ownership.andP;  Thatdiscussion has got to stop in the U.S.andP;  We, as a global company, believe thatis a dangerous development.andP;  I have shown to you that the investments ofEuropean countries in the U.S., of course, are major, but the moment youbegin to discriminate against foreign-owned companies, you have created adangerous development, because it leads to immediate retaliation, and I thinkthat is the last thing we want.andP;  Nowadays, we have all decided thatbusinesses are to be global, that the world is to be one big marketplace, andthat we want a high degree of free trade.andP;  Then, if a company establishesitself in another country, and has a role to play, we should expect not tosee discrimination.andP;  This brings me to a rather interesting and topicalsubject--High Definition Television (HDTV).andM;HDTV is the next step in the development of television, after black-and-whiteand color.andP;  The moment you talk about new developments, you must also discussa world standard.andP;  The same was true for the VCR and the compact disc.andO;Unfortunately, the U.S.andP;  did not play an important role in these developmentsbecause the consumer electronics industry in the U.S.andP;  had virtuallydisappeared.andP;  So, when there was a meeting in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia aboutthree years ago to define the new standards, the Americans thought theJapanese system was the best way to go.andP;  Fortunately for the Americans, theEuropeans knew it was not the best system and not the right way to go.andP;  Then,all of a sudden, HDTV became an interesting topic.andP;  At the same time--andthis is a point which we have been making for many years--consumerelectronics became a very important product.andP;  If you want to be a majorplayer in electronics, you cannot abandon consumer electronics.andM;Not only did the U.S.andP;  abandon the consumer electronics industry, but thevery company which invented color television, RCA, gave up, as did many othercompanies.andP;  It has to do with short-term bottom line management.andP;  I am nottrying to suggest that short-term bottom line management is always wrong, butyou have to have staying power in consumer electronics so that when somethingnew comes on the horizon, like HDTV, you are there and able to play a role.andM;While the U.S.andP;  was abandoning the consumer electronics industry, companieslike Philips were establishing themselves here and investing for the future.andO;As a result, today in the U.S.andP;  we have research centers, we have integratedmanufacturing, and we employ more people together than the top 10 Japaneseelectronics companies combined.andP;  So we are playing a responsible role in theU.S.andP;  economy.andP;  And now, in spite of the fact that Philips has enormousexperience in TV and HDTV, we are now hearing, &quot;Well, the U.S.andP;  may developsomething in the area, but foreign-owned companies are not allowed toparticipate.&quot;andP;  We believe that is wrong.andM;If we were a fly-by-night operation, then we would understand, but we are aresponsible corporate citizen making a major contribution to the economy ofthis country, and we do not think this kind of discrimination should exist.andO;Moreover--and here I come to my point of reciprocity--in Europe, IBM, ATandamp;T,DEC are participating in programs which are subsidized by European countries,by European taxpayers.andP;  If we Europeans continue to be excluded from Americanprograms, then, of course, you will get retaliation.andP;  For these reasons I saywe should not talk about Fortresses, we should talk about fraternity, weshould talk about reciprocity.andM;Now then you ask: 'How shall a global, international company behave?'andP;  It mayinterest you to know that Philips has existed nearly 100 years, we areestablished in 60 countries, and we have learned one thing in 100 years--ifyou want to play a role in a major market you have to bring something to thetable.andM;My next point is that it is absolutely impossible to have a philosophy thatsays: 'I'm going to make everything in my home market, and from there, I'llexport to the rest of the world.'andP;  You can do that for a certain length oftime, you can do that for certain products, but if you want to be a majorplayer, there is only one way to go--to establish yourself in the majormarket, and have manufacturing activities, have research activities, haveresources over there, because that is the only way you can become a respectedcorporate citizen and that is the only way you can really do business in aprofitable way; you must be part of the environment.andP;  When you see theprofits being made by companies like Ford and General Motors in the Europeanoperations, you know that they have established themselves in the Europeanoperations, and have done that in a very profitable way.andM;In closing, I would like to say that the major industrial regions of theworld--the U.S., Europe, and Japan--should have a level playing field.andP;  Thereshould be similar opportunities for companies of one country in the otherareas and vice versa.andP;  Moreover, if we are not careful in this respect, thenwe may indeed end up with a Fortress Europe, Fortress United States, and aFortress Japan.andP;  And I have a plea: Let us not make this a self-fulfillingprophecy.andM;Qandamp;A Session Reveals Audience ConcernsandM;Following the lecture, Jeelof lobbied questions from the audience regardingsuch issues as the state of European economies and industries.andP;  Here is asample of his responses:andM;The Japanese, in general, are worried about Europeans bashing Japan,politically and economically.andP;  I have two questions regarding this subject-1)Does your opinion reflect the general tendency of the leaders of Europeaneconomies, and 2) If so, is there any possibility that that kind of emotionmay lead to a specific EC policy targeted toward Japan?andM;The way I put some of these things may sound a bit critical, but I was onlygiving you the facts.andP;  Direct investments from foreign countries in Japan arevery small, while direct investments of Japan in the rest of the world aregrowing very, very fast.andP;  That's an imbalance that Japan will not get awaywith.andP;  It is the responsibility of a global worldwide company, wanting tooperate in a major market, to bring resources to that market.andP;  If a countryonly exports products in and takes away jobs, that is something it will notget away with long-term.andP;  You begin to make industrial enemies.andP;  We see ithappening now.andP;  All of a sudden we see Japanese industries opening upfactories in Europe, factories in the United States.andP;  Because that policy ofmaking everything in one place and exporting it from there, when you want tobe a major player, it just does not work that way.andP;  The world is not madethat way.andP;  And, if you want to be a successful factor in a major market, youhave to be a responsible corporate citizen.andM;Can you give a timetable for the development of a common European currency?andM;I think that is going to take quite a bit on time.andP;  There is a possibilitythat it may result in the devaluation of some European currencies, but forbusiness, a stable currency is a great asset.andP;  It is a fantastic advantage.andM;Who do you think the expression &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; is widely used in theAmerican press and in American business terminology?andM;We feel that the expression &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; describes something which isimpenetrable, and that is not what the European market is all about.andP;  We arecreating an environment in which everybody who wants to play a role can comein, and that is different from a fortress.andP;  That is why we are concernedabout this expression &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; being heard in business circles andthe news media.andP;  In terms of a bargaining position of the outside world, itwill now be much easier to deal with a united Europe rather than deal with 12independent countries, playing one against the other.andP;  Now, you have only oneentity to deal with, and that, of course, is one of the purposes of theexercise.andM;We hear a lot about how the big companies will be advantaged by Europeanintegration in 1992.andP;  What about small European companies?andP;  How will theybenefit from unification?andM;We believe that competition is very healthy.andP;  If some companies exist andcontinue to exist because of an artificial environment, we have always saidthat is wrong.andP;  I would say, in general, business in Europe will benefit, beit big or small, because Europe will be growing.andP;  The gross national productof Europe will be growing, and that is always good for business.andM;Aren't Spain and Portugal benefiting from the 1992 European unificationprocess because of their labor rates?andM;Spain and Portugal are cheap labor markets, but when their standard of livingcomes up to the level of other countries, their labor rates will rise.andP;  Don'tyou have the same thing in the United States?andP;  We must begin to look atEurope as one country.andM;Gerrit Jeelof is vice chairman, N.V.andP;  Philips of The Netherlands andchairman, North American Philips Corporation.andP;  For his contributions toindustry and commerce, Jeelof was made a Commander of the British Empire.andP;  Hehas also been honored by Italy and The Netherlands with their highestcivilian honors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
