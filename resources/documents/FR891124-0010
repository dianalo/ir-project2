Itprovides opportunity for individuals other than career astronauts to participateas onboard members of the flight crew under specified conditions. The purposeof such participation by these individuals is to ensure the achievementof the payload or mission-related objectives.(b) The STS will provide these additional crew members with a habitableworking environment and support services in such a way as to require aminimum of dedicated space flight training, allowing them to concentratetheir efforts on the accomplishment of their scientific, technical, ormission objectives.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1214.303</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General</T3>. (1) The Challenger accident marked a major change inthe U.S. outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other thanNASA astronauts. NASA and interested external parties, domestic and international,must re-examine previous understandings, expectations, and commitmentsregarding flight opportunities in light of the new policies now being enunciated.(2) NASA policies and their implementation recognize that:(i) Every flight of the Shuttle involves risks;(ii) Flight opportunities will now generally be limited to professionalNASA astronauts and payload specialists essential for mission requirements;and(iii) Top priority must be given to:(A) Establishing, proving, and maintaining the reliability and safety ofthe Shuttle system;(B) Timely and efficient reduction of the backlog of high priority scientificand national security missions; and maximum utilization of the Shuttlecapacity for primary and secondary payloads that require transportationto or from orbit by the Space Shuttle.(3) All Shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum NASA crew of fiveastronauts (commander, pilot, and three mission specialists). When payloador other mission requirements define a need and operational constraintspermit, the crew size can be increased to a maximum of seven. Any suchadditional crew members must be identified at least 12 months before flightand be available for crew integration at 6 months.(4) NASA policy and terminology are revised to recognize two categoriesof persons other than NASA astronauts, each of which requires separatepolicy treatment. They are:(i) ``Payload specialists,'' redefined to refer to persons other than NASAastronauts (commanders, pilots, and mission specialists), whose presenceis required onboard the Space Shuttle to perform specialized functionswith respect to operation of one or more payloads or other essential missionactivities.(ii) ``Space flight participants,'' defined to refer to persons whose presenceonboard the Space Shuttle is <T3>not</T3> required for operation of payloads or for other essentialmission activities, but is determined by the Administrator of NASA to contributeto other approved NASA objectives or to be in the national interest.(b) <T3>Payload specialists.</T3> Payload specialists may be added to Shuttlecrews when more than the minimum crew size of five is needed and uniquerequirements are involved. In the case of foreign-sponsored missions andpayloads, the need and requirements for payload specialists will be negotiatedand mutually agreed between the foreign sponsors and NASA. The selectionprocess for additional crew members to meet approved requirements willfirst give consideration to qualified NASA mission specialists. When payloadspecialists are required, they will be nominated by the appropriate NASA,foreign, or other designated payload sponsor. In the case of NASA or NASA-relatedpayloads, the nominations will be based on the recommendations of the appropriateInvestigator Working Group (IWG).(c) <T3>Space flight participants.</T3> NASA remains committed to the long-termgoal of providing space flight opportunities for persons outside the professionalcategories of NASA astronauts and payload specialists when this contributesto approved NASA objectives or is determined to be in the national interest.However, NASA is devoting its attention to proving the Shuttle system'scapablity for safe, reliable operation and to reducing the backlog of highpriority missions. Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participantsare not available at this time. NASA will assess Shuttle operations andmission and payload requirements on an annual basis to determine when itcan begin to allocate and assign space flight opportunities for futurespace flight participants, consistent with safety and mission considerations.When NASA determines that a flight opportunity is available for a spaceflight participant, first priority will be given to a ``teacher in space,''in fulfillment of space education plans.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1214.304 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Process.</ITAG>(a) Determining the need for additional crew members. The payload sponsorwill be responsible for recommending the number of addition crew membersand for establishing the technical or scientific need, the selection criteria,uniqueness of qualifications, the proposed training, and other requirementsfor the additional crew members. The payload sponsor's requirements foradditional crew members, their qualifications, and the proposed durationfor training will be reviewed with and concurred in by the Associate Administratorfor Space Flight.(b) Selection of additional crew members for NASA and NASA-related payloads.After the requirement for additional crew members has been established,the IWG will be tasked by the payload sponsor to commence the selectionprocess. The IWG review process will include the participation of a seniorastronaut from the Flight Crew Operations Directorate at the Johnson SpaceCenter who will provide operational and applicant suitability criteria.(1) Prior to the payload sponsor's recommendation for additional crew membersand at his/her direction, the IWG will have studied the requirements ofthe selected investigations, the number, qualifications, training requirementsand other requirements of payload specialists, and backups necessary tosupport the payload objectives, and made recommendations to the payloadsponsor.(2) Members of the mission specialist cadre will be considered first. Thepayload mission manager, on behalf of the IWG, will convey the selectioncriteria for the proposed additional crew members to the Chief, AstronautOffice. The IWG, the mission manager, and the Astronaut Office will coordinatethe review of the proposed candidates and the mission manager will forwardrecommendations to the payload sponsor. Recommendations from the payloadsponsor will be submitted to the Associate Administrator for Space Flightfor approval.(3) If mission specialists meeting the requirements cannot be providedbecause of the uniqueness of requirements or impracticability of the resultanttraining obligation, or if backup payload specialists are required, theIWG may then solicit candidate payload specialists from outside the careerastronaut corps. The solicitation will require, as a minimum, that a summaryof professional qualifications be submitted to the IWG. In addition, amedical history, and the results of the physical examination describedin paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section will be required. The IWG willbe responsible for:(i) Establishing professional and operational criteria for payload specialistsfor specific payloads. The criteria will include willingness on the partof the candidate to accept the applicable provisions of andSection; 1214.306and satisfactory completion of a background investigation conducted toNASA's standards, as determined by the Director, NASA Security Office.(ii) Evaluating all candidates using the criteria established.(iii) Determining which candidate payload specialists, who meet the NASAClass III Space Flight Medical Selection Standards, are deemed best professionallyqualified. (The preselection phases of the medical examination will beconducted at Johnson Space Center by certified examiners approved by theDirector, Life Sciences Division, NASA Headquarters).(iv) Submitting its recommendations for payload specialists through themission manager to the payload sponsor who in turn will determine finalrecommendations which will be reviewed with and concurred in by the AssociateAdministrator for Space Flight.(4) The payload sponsor and the Associate Administrator for Space Flightwill advise the Administrator of the payload specialist selections.(c) Selection of additional crew members for foreign payloads. The needand requirements for payload specialists will be negotiated and mutuallyagreed to between the foreign sponsor and NASA. This negotiating processwill include the participation of a senior astronaut from the Flight CrewOperations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center who will provide operationaland applicant suitability criteria. After agreement is reached, the payloadsponsor will initiate the selection process. Subject to the negotiatedagreement, subsequent steps in the process will be similar to those describedin andSection; 1214.304(b) modified as follows:(1) The IWG functions will be performed by a selection committee or otherprocedure designated by the payload sponsor.(2) The payload sponsor will designate an individual to perform the missionmanager functions.(3) The committee or procedure in paragraph (c)(1) of this section andthe person named in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be establishedduring the negotiations between the foreign sponsor and NASA, consistentwith the specific circumstances.(4) The payload sponsor will also be responsible for submission to NASAby an appropriate authority of written assurance that an inquiry has beenmade into the recommended payload specialist's background and suitabilityon the basis of standards similar to those applied to NASA payload specialistcandidates and a statement by the selected candidate asserting a willingnessto accept the applicable provisions of andSection; 1214.306. These writtenassurances must be received and accepted by NASA before selection and beforeany NASA training can begin.(d) Selection of additional crew members for other payloads. After therequest for additional crew members is approved, the payload sponsor willcommence the selection process. The payload sponsor review process willinclude the participation of a senior astronaut from the Flight Crew OperationsDirectorate at the Johnson Space Center who will provide operational andapplicant suitability criteria.(1) The payload sponsor will first consider members of the mission specialistcadre. A representative of the payload sponsor selection committee willconvey the selection criteria for the proposed payload specialists to theChief, Astronaut Office, and coordinate on the recommendations for missionspecialists to satisfy the requirements. The recommendations will be submittedto the Associate Administrator for Space Flight for approval who will thenadvise the Administrator of the selections.(2) If mission specialists meeting the requirements cannot be providedbecause of the uniqueness of qualifications or impracticability of theresultant training obligation, the payload sponsor selection committee,with concurrence from the payload sponsor and the Associate Administratorfor Space Flight, may then consider other candidate payload specialists.The payload sponsor will be responsible for:(i) Establishing professional and operational criteria for payload specialistsfor specific payloads. The criteria will include willingness on the partof the candidate to accept the applicable provisions of andSection; 1214.306and satisfactory completion of a background investigation conducted toNASA's standards, as determined by the Director, NASA Security Office.(ii) Evaluating all candidates using the criteria established.(iii) Determining which candidate payload specialists, who meet the NASAClass III Space Flight Medical Selection Standards, are deemed best professionallyqualified. (The preselection phases of the medical examination will beconducted at the Johnson Space Center by certified examiners approved bythe Director, Life Sciences Division, NASA Headquarters).(iv) Submitting its recommendations for payload specialist selection tothe Associate Administrator for Space Flight for approval.(e) Preflight activities for additional crew members. Mission specialistsserving as additional crew for the payload, once selected, will be primarilyresponsible to the mission manager who, together with the IWG (or comparablebody designated by the payload sponsor) and the Director, Flight Crew Operations,will determine the integrated training and work schedules as appropriateto the areas of responsibilities outlined in the following paragraphs.(1) The IWG for NASA and NASA-related payloads or the Payload Sponsor forall other payloads is responsible for defining the training necessary forpayload elements within its cognizance. The mission manager is responsiblefor the total integrated payload training and will assist the IWG as necessaryin carrying out the defined training activities.(2) The Director, Flight Crew Operations, is responsible for establishingthe training requirements for payload specialists on Orbiter, Spacelab,and STS-provided payload support systems as appropriate. In order to enhancethe crew integration process, the additional crew members (payload specialistsand additional mission specialists) will be based at the Johnson SpaceCenter 6 months prior to flight, unless otherwise agreed between the payloadsponsor and the Director, Flight Crew Operations, Johnson Space Center.(3) The payload specialists must be certified for flight by the Director,Flight Crew Operations, upon satisfactory completion of all required trainingand demonstrated performance of assigned tasks. Certification of the payloadspecialist's readiness for flight will be made to the payload mission managerand will include an assessment by the crew commander of the payload specialist'ssuitability for space flight.(4) The mission manager is responsible for verifying to the payload sponsorthat all crew members are properly trained for in-flight payload operations.(i) The medical program for payload specialists will be continued duringthe preflight period in accordance with the NASA Class III Space FlightMedical Selection Standards.(ii) If, during the preflight period, the number of additional crew membersis reduced to fewer than that agreed to, or an additional crew member doesnot meet the certification requirements, the necessary reprocessing maybe initiated to provide replacements consistent with the above describedselection process and the STS training requirements.(f) Designation of primary and backup payload specialists (when required).At an appropriate time designated by the mission manager (not later than9 months prior to flight), the IWG for NASA and NASA-related payloads orpayload sponsor for all other payloads will recommend which payload specialistsshould be designated as prime and which as backup. However, in cases wheremission specialists have been selected for the payload specialist position(s),they will be considered as primary at the time of selection. The recommendationswill be forwarded by the mission manager to the Program Office which willreview the recommendations and forward them to the Associate Administratorfor Space Flight for concurrence. The payload sponsor and the AssociateAdministrator for Space Flight will advise the Administrator of the selections.(g) Effective date. The described selection process will apply to all STSmissions for which selections have not been approved prior to December31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1214.305</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payload specialist responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) Relationship with flight crew. The crew commander has overall responsibilityfor crew integration and the safe and successful conduct of the mission.With respect to crew and vehicle safety, the commander has ultimate responsibilityand authority for all assigned crew duties. The payload specialist is responsibleto the authority of the commander and operates in compliance with missionrules and Payload Operation Control Center directives. Payload specialistsare expected to operate as an integral part of the crew and will participatein crew activities as specified by the crew commander.(b) Operation of payload elements. The payload specialist will be responsiblefor the operation of the assigned payload elements. Onboard decisions concerningassigned payload operations will be made by the payload specialist. A payloadspecialist may be designated to resolve conflicts between the payload elementsand approve such deviation from the flight plan as may arise from equipmentfailures or STS factors. In the instance of STS factors, the mission specialistwill present the available options for the payload-related decisions bythe payload specialist.(c) Operation of STS equipment. The payload specialist will be responsiblefor knowing how to operate certain Obiter systems, such as hatches, food,and hygiene systems, and for proficiency in those normal and emergencyprocedures which are required for safe crew operations, including emergencyegress and bail out. The responsibility for on-orbit management of Orbitersystems and attached payload support systems and for extravehicular activityand payload manipulation with the Remote Manipulator System will rest withthe NASA flight crew. The NASA flight crew will operate Orbiter systemsand standard payload support systems, such as Spacelab and Internal UpperStage systems. With approval of the commander, payload specialists mayoperate payload support systems which have an extensive interface withthe payload.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1214.306</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payload specialist relationship with sponsoring institutions.</ITAG>Specialists who are not U.S. Government employees must enter into a contractualor other arrangement establishing an obligatory relationship with an institutionparticipating in the payload as designated by the payload sponsor priorto selection and before entering into training at a NASA installation orNASA-designated location. Payload specialists who are not otherwise U.S.Government employees will not become U.S. Government employees by virtueof being selected as a payload specialist.
