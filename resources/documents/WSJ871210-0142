Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation, the French aircraft maker, said it is holding discussions with Iraq about the sale of several Mirage F-1 fighter planes. But the company and French government officials denied reports that a contract is about to be signed.    A Defense Ministry spokesman said that &quot;to my knowledge, there has been no administrative agreement&quot; by France to proceed with the sale, which, like all sales of military equipment, must have government approval. He said that such a sale was possible because of France's longstanding support for Iraq, but that there is &quot;no new element&quot; in France's relations with Baghdad. The spokesman suggested that what's holding up the sale is less a question of politics than whether Iraq can afford the planes. &quot;We don't like to sell to people who can't pay,&quot; he said.    Dassault officials wouldn't say how many planes the company hopes to sell or how large a contract might be.    A sale would be a boon to Dassault, which hasn't received an export order all year. In October, Dassault announced the closing of four work sites and 1,261 layoffs in the coming year.    In the first half, the company's pretax profit plummeted more than 90%, to 42.6 million French francs ($7.57 million) from 437.7 million francs a year earlier. That followed a 36% decline for all of 1986, to 293.4 million francs, on sales of 15.6 billion francs.    But a sale would come at an extremely delicate time for the government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, which has been attempting a balancing act between Iraq and Iran since coming to power 18 months ago.    France wants to normalize its strained ties with Iran in the hope of winning the release of the last three French hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalist groups. One of the conditions Iran has set is that France stop supporting Iraq's army -- which France refuses to do.    France broke its diplomatic ties with Iran this summer, leading to a five-month diplomatic crisis during which each country's embassy in the other nation was blockaded.    Ten days ago, two other French hostages were released. In exchange, France allowed the return to Tehran of an interpreter at the Iranian Embassy who the French believe was involved in a murderous wave of bomb attacks last year.    The French government denies it made a deal with Iran, but that charge was revived earlier this week, when the government abruptly expelled to Gabon 17 opponents of the Iranian regime. President Francois Mitterrand yesterday asked the government for explanations but received no answer, spokesmen said.    Some analysts said that a military sale to Iraq would allow France to reassure Baghdad that it isn't tilting toward Iran. But others said such a move isn't consistent with France's desire to repair relations with Iran. &quot;This sort of maneuver doesn't seem necessary to me at a crucial moment in negotiations,&quot; said Dominique Moisi, associate director of the French Institute for International Relations.    Mr. Moisi said he didn't think that such a sale was likely now, but that France was &quot;letting the rumor out to reassure moderate Arab nations that were destabilized by France's moves with Iran.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
