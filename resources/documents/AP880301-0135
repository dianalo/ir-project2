Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov suggested thatthe Sunday unrest in Sumgait, as well as demonstrations and otherviolence elsewhere in the Caucasus region in which at least twopeople died, were due to ``mistakes'' made 65 years ago when aterritory composed largely of Armenians was made part ofneighboring Azerbaidzhan.   He told a government news briefing that ``there were certaininjuries'' in Sumgait, an industrial city of more than 160,000people in Azerbaidzhan where hooligans were blamed for touching offthe Sunday riot.   ``The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,''Gerasimov said.   The official was peppered with questions about the civil unrestin the southern Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaidzhan at hisregular Tuesday news briefing, but he said he had few details aboutevents there.   Moscow-based foreign journalists have been barred from theregion, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and theofficial media have reached the Soviet capital.   ``When passions calm down and life starts to normalize, theappearance of some journalists in this region can lead tointensification of nationalistic feelings,'' Gerasimov said,explaining why restrictions have been imposed to keepcorrespondents from visiting the area.   Asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling the streetsof Sumgait, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians in thestreets, and that there have been at least two deaths in the city,Gerasimov said,``There is a curfew.''   He said he had not heard anything about tanks being sent to thecity.   Asked if troops remained in the city Tuesday, Gerasimov said,``I don't know, but I guess so. Presumably.''   The violence in Sumgait, reported Monday by the official newsagency Tass, followed earlier outbreaks 150 miles away inNagorno-Karabakh, the contested region in Azerbaidzhan, and massivebut apparently peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan, the capital ofArmenia.   The demonstrators demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh, which has beenpart of Azerbaidzhan since 1923, be made part of Armenia. Aboutthree-quarters of the region's population of 157,000 are ethnicArmenians.   Gerasimov said he did not have detailed reports from the entireregion but that what information he had indicated ``everything iscalm'' in Yerevan and surrounding areas.   ``The events that took place caused great concern to us,'' thespokesman said. ``We think it is not a proper way to settle theproblems that have accumulated.''   Gerasimov acknowledged, however, that the unrest apparentlystemmed from ``some mistakes made in national relations, and thesemistakes should be rectified.''   Soviet authorities have pledged to reconsider the issue ofwhether Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaidzhan.Gerasimov's remarks seemed to indicate the region would be turnedover to Armenia. He did not, however, say when that might occur.   Asked if he was indeed saying Nagorno-Karabakh should be madepart of Armenia, the spokesman said, ``I meant there were somemistakes in Nagorno-Karabakh.''   Gerasimov described the region as ``a kind of enclave'' inAzerbaidzhan with 49 nationalities represented among the populationthat is nonetheless mostly Armenian.   ``That is why we should be very tactful in handling thisquestion in order not to cause differences between brothers andnationalities. The previous policy had some mistakes in thisarea,'' he said.   On Saturday, a Soviet prosecutor reported that two people livingin a region of Azerbaidzhan that borders on Nagorno-Karabakh hadbeen slain in unrest caused by the territorial dispute.   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for``civic maturity and restraint'' in Azerbaidzhan and Armenia, andpromised that the Communist Party Central Committee would reviewrelations among the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.   That same day Gorbachev also met with two prominent Armenianwriters to help work out a solution to the problem overNagorno-Karabakh.   Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in theCaucasus. It is bordered on the west by largely Christian Armeniaand Georgia and on the north by the Russian Republic. The CaspianSea runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge.   The republic is mainly Shiite Moslem, except for ArmenianChristians living in the Nagorno-Karbakh region.</TEXT></DOC>
