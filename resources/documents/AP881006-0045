Emperor Hirohito received 0.4 pints of blood in a transfusionthis morning after discharging a small amount of blood, accordingto palace officials.   It was the 14th-straight day transfusions have been given to the87-year-old emperor, who has been bedridden since internalhemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood on Sept. 19.   Kenji Maeda, head of the general affairs department of theImperial Household Agency, told reporters the emperor's temperaturewas 100.58 degrees as of 9:00 a.m. Wednesday morning his fever was98.96 degrees.   ``We cannot rule out the possibility that the emperor's feverwas caused by internal inflammation in the upper digestive tract,or by (the series of) blood transfusions, or both'' Maeda quotedAkira Takagi, the emperor's chief physician, as saying.   Hirohito has so far received a total of 11.98 pints intransfusions, well above the normal amount of blood circulating inhis body, according to news reports.   Doctors halted a blood transfusion being given to the emperorWednesday afternoon before it was complete because of concern overhis high temperature and rising pulse rate.   Hirohito's temperature and pulse rate rose sharply Wednesday asdoctors administered the transfusion in an attempt to ``helpovercome anemia and improve his overall physical condition,'' Maedasaid.   The world's longest-reigning monarch has continued to dischargesmall amounts of blood intermittently since the onset of the crisis.   He has been unable to take solid food except for two smallfragments of ice and a few spoonfuls of porridge since fallingsick. He is being fed intravenously.   News reports have said Hirohito has cancer, but palace officialshave refused to confirm or deny them and have urged the media torefrain from making such speculation.</TEXT></DOC>
