(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Tuscarora Indians who were acquittedof federal charges stemming from the takeover of a Robeson Countynewspaper were indicted by a state grand jury Tuesday on 14 countsof second-degree kidnapping.   Superior Court Judge Robert Hobgood issued arrest orders forEddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs after the indictments werereturned. Hobgood set bond for the two men at $140,000 each.   Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs, 20, were acquitted by a federal juryOct. 14 on hostage-taking and firearms violations. The chargesstemmed from the Feb. 1 takeover of The Robesonian newspaper inLumberton, in which up to 20 people were held hostage.   Hatcher and Jacobs never denied taking over the newspaper, butsaid they were trying to save their lives by drawing attention toHatcher's claims that he had information linking public officials todrug trafficking.   State Bureau of Investigation agent James Bowman said he expectedmore indictments to come later against alleged co-conspirators andothers suspected of obstruction of justice. He would not elaborate.   The indictments named only 14 hostages as prosecution witnessesin the case. Bowman said investigators believed some of the hostagesdid not wish to prosecute the men.   The six hostages not listed in the indictments includedRobesonian editor Bob Horne and newspaper employees Ricky McKinnonand Raymond Godfrey, as well as three hostages who were notnewspaper employees.   The maximum sentence for second-degree kidnapping is 30 years oneach count. The presumptive sentence _ the sentence normally given _is nine years.</TEXT></DOC>
