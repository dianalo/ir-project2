In its order, the FCC concluded ``this is not an appropriatetime'' to levy interstate access charges on providers ofinformation services because the industry is in a ``uniquelycomplex period of transition.''   The commission, which voted last week on the action and releasedthe text of its order Wednesday, is considering plans by the localBell telephone companies to give equal access to informationproviders. These plans could change the way information servicesare provided over the local networks.   ``It would be prudent to defer consideration of our proposal ...until we are more certain of the effects'' of the Bell companies'interconnection plans, the FCC said.   The agency's plan would have added about $4.50 an hour to thecost for a computer user to link up electronically with aninformation provider. That cost would more than double the hourlyhookup price for some data bases.   The FCC proposal would have extended to computer users the sameaccess charges now paid by long-distance companies for access tothe local phone network. The long-distance companies pass thesecharges along to callers in their rates.   The agency, when it adopted the long-distance access charges in1982, exempted information service providers from the fees becauseof the fear that the new industry would not withstand the suddenincrease in costs.   The commission found virtually no support for its plan. Computerusers said the increased costs would drive many of them off thecomputer networks and crush a fledgling industry.   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Housetelecommunications subcommittee, said in a statement the FCC'saction ``will remove a serious threat to the health of the enhancedservices industry.''</TEXT></DOC>
