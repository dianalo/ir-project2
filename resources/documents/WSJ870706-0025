Thompson Co., including John P. Thompson and Jere W. Thompson, Southland's top two executives, said it will begin a tender offer today for as many as 31.5 million Southland shares, or two-thirds of the company's shares outstanding, for $77 a share. The company also will offer to buy all 2.5 million Southland convertible preferred shares for $90.27 each.    Southland shares closed Thursday at $68.50, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The nation's stock exchanges were closed Friday.    The move by Thompson, which is owned by Thompson family members, ends several weeks of takeover speculation that pushed Southland's stock from the $47-a-share range to near $70 a share in active trading. Rumors abounded that a potential acquirer was buying Southland shares, and the names of several possible buyers, including Dart Group Corp., were bandied about.    About two weeks ago, Southland acknowledged that it was considering restructuring alternatives, but wouldn't elaborate. The owner and operator of 8,200 7-Eleven stores repeatedly has said it didn't know of reasons for the heavy trading in its stock. But stock traders continued to expect Southland to take some action, even while several analysts and industry executives said they believed Southland wouldn't respond unless a hostile bidder emerged.    Yesterday, the Thompsons said they had lined up $2.73 billion in bank financing from Citicorp Industrial Credit Inc., Bankers Trust Co., Manufacturers Hanover Co., Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Security Pacific National Bank. They also have arranged $600 million in bridge financing from Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. And they said a special committee of Southland's outside directors had judged the offer to be fair.    The Thompsons also are proposing to refinance Southland's $950 million in long-term debt, which would require the family to raise a total of $5.1 billion to complete the transaction.    The family &quot;certainly wanted to retain control. That was the most important part,&quot; said Edward Gagnon of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., whose top estimate on the value of the company's stock is about $70 a share. Mr. Gagnon called the $77-a-share offer &quot;a very attractive price.&quot;    Terms of the transaction call for the tender offer to end July 31. Under the second step, shareholders who don't tender or whose shares aren't purchased under the tender offer would receive for each share they own $61.32 in cash and 0.6272 of a new $25 preferred share. The fraction of the new preferred would have a stated value of $15.68, and would pay a 15% dividend in additional stock. The preferred could be exchanged for subordinated debentures after two years, at Southland's option.    The company said when the two parts of the transaction are blended, it is offering $72 in cash and $5 in new preferred for each of Southland's 48.8 million common shares outstanding.    John Thompson, Southland's chairman; Jere Thompson, president and chief executive officer; and Joe C. &quot;Jodie&quot; Thompson, a former Southland executive who left the company in January to purchase a liquor-store chain, currently own about five million Southland shares, or about 10.3% of the company. All officers and directors combined owned about 15% of Southland's stock on March 31.    The three Thompsons are brothers. Thompson Co. is one of several Thompson entities that own real estate and other investments, including Southland stock.    In acquiring Southland, the Thompsons will be taking on a considerable debt load for a company that had $3.67 billion in assets and a debt-to-capital level of 36.7% on March 31. Southland's 1986 earnings fell about 6% to $200.4 million, on revenue of $8.62 billion, mostly because of losses in its Citgo Petroleum Corp. refining unit. The company last year sold half its interest in Citgo to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.    A Southland spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate on the transaction until the tender offer begins. But analysts have suggested that anyone acquiring Southland probably would have to sell off some of its assets, such as its real estate holdings or its food-processing and manufacturing operations, to reduce debt.    The Thompsons said the offer is contingent on 31.5 million common shares and 1.3 million preferred shares being tendered. It also is subject to the company receiving the necessary financing.    As part of the agreement, Southland said it will redeem its preferred stock purchase rights, or so-called &quot;poison pill,&quot; at five cents a share before shares are purchased under the tender offer. The company also said it amended its shareholder rights plan to prevent this offer or a more favorable one from triggering the rights and making an acquisition considerably more expensive. </TEXT></DOC>
