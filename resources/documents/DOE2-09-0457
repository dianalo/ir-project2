Radiographs of &quot;subtle&quot; cancers, &quot;obvious&quot; cancers,and normal tissue were shown to four observers for 0.25 sec, 1 sec, 4sec, and an unlimited time. Receiver operating characteristic analysisindicated deterioration in performance as viewing time decreased. Thetrue positive fraction for subtle and obvious cancers was 30% and 70%at 0.25 sec and 74% and 98% at unlimited viewing time, respectively,for a given false-positive fraction of 20%. The difference in detectabilitybetween subtle and obvious lung cancers was exaggerated at shorter viewingtimes.</TEXT></DOC>
