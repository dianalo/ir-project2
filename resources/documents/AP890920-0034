The Bush forces outmaneuvered environmental groups Tuesday in a12-10 House subcommittee vote defeating a bid to toughen theadministration's anti-smog requirements for cities, less populatedareas and small business.   The vote came as President Bush challenged the Democratic-runCongress to quicken its pace on the legislation. He commented at aSpokane, Wash., centennial tree-planting ceremony.   White House lobbyists, who were credited by their chief opponentwith making the difference Tuesday, must work even harder to savethe most controversial part of the legislation _ letting automakerscomply with anti-pollution requirements by averaging emissions ofengine families.   The administration Tuesday proposed a modification of theaveraging language, to make clear that pollution reduction goalsmust be met. The issue could face a vote in the House Energy andCommerce environment subcommittee today, with environmental groupsmaking an all-out attempt to halt the emission averaging proposal.   During the next several weeks, the administration must defendagainst challenges to other portions of the bill.   It will try to preserve language to prevent growth of sulfurdioxide once it is reduced by 10 million tons over the next decade.This provision could stunt the growth of electric utilities that usehigh-sulfur coal, the chief source of acid rain.   There also will be attempts to force the administration to acceptnationwide cost-sharing of acid rain reduction, a burden that mayotherwise fall chiefly on nine states with dirty, coal-burning powerplants. The administration opposes cost-sharing, believing thepolluters should pay the cost.   The attempt to toughen the administration's proposed requirementsfor reducing urban smog failed under a barrage of criticism. Bushbackers argued that jobs in small business would be lost, areasstatistically attached to cities in federal groupings would beforced to meet stiff pollution-cutting standards, and cities couldnot meet the proposal's deadlines.   ``We should never be in a posture where we legislate absurdity,''said Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who supported Bush. Rep.John D. Dingell, chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committeeand chief Democratic sponsor of the Bush bill, called thealternative ``harsh'' and ``punitive.''   Also working hard to defeat the plan was ranking committeeRepublican Norman F. Lent of New York.   The vote in the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee wasa defeat for the panel's chairman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.,champion of the environmental groups' positions and sponsor of theamendment.   ``The White House took it very seriously and was working hardagainst it,'' Waxman said after a loss that followed a long day ofpolitical maneuvering.   The Bush forces made the first major move of the day when Lent,backed by Dingell, introduced the administration's package thatwould modify auto emissions averaging.   While preserving the averaging concept, the package wouldexplicitly state that reductions in auto pollutants must equal theimprovement that would be achieved if each car were forced to meetthe emissions standards. Under current law, each car must pass thetest.   Even though the Bush plan would set tougher standards forautomakers to meet, environmentalists want to wipe out averagingaltogether because it would allow some cars to flunk anti-pollutiontests. Other cars would have to meet the standards with aconsiderable margin of safety.   Environmental organizations argue that the margin of safety wouldnot be enough to offset the cars failing to meet the requirements,and emissions would rise.   Other parts of the administration package would prevent aweakening of current law on pollution from tall smokestacks; setrequirements for planning and responding to toxic chemicalaccidents; strengthen motor vehicle inspection and maintenanceprograms; protect air quality in national parks, and requirediagnostic equipment on autos.</TEXT></DOC>
