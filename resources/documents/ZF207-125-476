(products).andO;Ticker:    HWP.andO;Product:   HP LaserJet (Computer printer) (usage).andO;Topic:     Laser PrintersProductivityTutorialPrintouts.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LaserJet Special: Pouring on the Power By the beginning of this year,Hewlett-Packard expected to sell its one millionth LaserJet laser printer.andO;That means a million laser printers with 300 dot-per-inch resolution, allequipped to produce great graphics work and near-typeset-quality printing.andM;And yet, in offices all over America, LaserJets are doing nothing morechallenging than plunking out 12-point Courier, imitating typewriters.andM;It doesn't have to be that way.andP;  The LaserJet is fully capable of printingtypography that rivals the most expensive PostScript-based lasers, from awide variety of applications.andP;  A new edition of a very complete book on theLaserJet, LaserJet Unlimited, Edition II, by Ted Nace and Michael Gardner,collects in its 512 pages a wealth of wisdom about getting the most out ofthis most widely used of laser printers.andP;  The book includes information onthe LaserJet, hardware accessories, using the LaserJet's Printer CommandLanguage, a flood of utilities to do everything from creating printer setupstrings via menus to creating sets of downloadable fonts, and using theLaserJet with a variety of applications.andM;This excerpt from LaserJet Unlimited concentrates on tips for making it eveneasier to use the LaserJet with programs that support it, such as WordPerfectand Microsoft Word, programs that offer enough fonts and formatting features(such as multiple columns) to do unlimited desktop publishing.andP;  Here also issome useful guidance on getting the LaserJet to work up to its potential ontough jobs like Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets, dBASE reports, and one of the biggestproblems for any printer, producing good-looking envelopes and labels.andM;Lotus PositionandM;With its ability to print wide spreadsheets sideways on a sheet of paper, itsselection of type styles and sizes, and its printing speed, the LaserJettheoretically makes an excellent companion to Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  We saytheoretically because translating that potential into reality can bedifficult.andM;Lotus 1-2-3 Releases 1A and 2.0 do not include commands for properlycontrolling the LaserJet.andP;  You have to take matters into your own hands,picking up where the program's designers left off.andP;  Knowing something aboutthe LaserJet's Printer Command Language (PCL) helps.andP;  1-2-3 offers two placesto put that knowledge to work--in setup strings and in PCL commands embeddedin the worksheet.andM;SURVEYING THE LANDSCAPEandM;To permanently set 1-2-3's defaults so that worksheets will print out on theLaserJet in landscape orientation (sideways down the length of the pagerather than across it), you must first build a new driver set using 1-2-3'sInstall program, then resent the default print parameters of the program andadd a setup string.andM;Run Install (if the necessary files aren't on your hard disk, put the LotusUtility disk in drive A: and run Install from there).andP;  Select Change SelectedEquipment and specify Text Printer.andP;  Scroll to Unlisted and press Enter.andO;(That's right, choose Unlisted rather than HP LaserJet.andP;  The LaserJet driversupplied by Lotus actually gets in the way more than it helps.)andP;  Also selectNo Backspace.andP;  Save your changes, name the setup file 123, and exit Install.andM;Run 1-2-3, load your worksheet, and then type /WGDP (for Worksheet GlobalDefault Printer).andP;  Enter P 45 to set the page length and R 106 to set theright margin.andP;  Enter S\027E\027andamp;l1O (this is the setup string that 1-2-3 willpass to the printer).andP;  Type QU (this makes the changes in the defaultparameters permanent).andP;  Then you can print your worksheet as usual.andM;BRIDGING THE GAPSandM;If your worksheet contains strange gaps when you print it out, there are twopossible causes.andM;Printing a new worksheet while the Form Feed light is on can cause a gap inthe middle of the page.andP;  Make sure that the Form Feed light is not on whenyou start printing a new page.andP;  If the light is on, it means that the lastpage of the previous spreadsheet is still in the printer.andP;  Eject that page bypressing the On Line button, the Form Feed button, then the On Line buttonagain, then print your worksheet.andM;Another cause of a gap is that 1-2-3 is trying to format the worksheet in away that the LaserJet cannot understand.andP;  To solve this, type /PPOOU, whichspecifies unformatted output to the printer.andM;HANDLING EJECTIONandM;When you print a worksheet that is less than a page, the Form Feed light onthe LaserJet control panel will light up but no page will emerge.andP;  To ejectthe page, press the LaserJet's On Line key and then Form Feed.andP;  If yourworksheet has multiple pages, you'll get all but the final page.andP;  To ejectit, press On Line and then press Form Feed.andM;Another way is to issue the Print Printer Page command from 1-2-3 when theWorksheet is printed: enter /PPP.andP;  (The third P, which instructs the printerto eject the current page and advance to the top of a new one, can be issuedwith a print command.andP;  You don't have to wait until the document is printed.)andM;A more automatic way to eject the last page from the printer, if you're usingRelease 2.0, is to embed a code in a worksheet.andP;  In the first cell of a blankrow at the bottom of your worksheet, type \012.andP;  (The vertical bar characteris on the same key as the backslash character.)andP;  When you type the twovertical bars into the worksheet, the first will be hidden, so what you seeon the screen will be \012.andP;  When you print the worksheet, include the linecontaining \012 as the last line in your selected range.andM;EMBED WITH A CODEandM;While 1-2-3 doesn't make it easy to do things such as change fonts on theLaserJet, there are a couple of ways to send the codes that control theLaserJet from within 1-2-3.andP;  One is to use a setup string from the printmenu.andP;  The other is to embed the codes in the worksheet.andP;  The \012 code toeject the final page of a worksheet is an embedded code.andP;  Their use ispossible only in Release 2.0 or later, not in Release 1A.andP;  The embedded codeto change to the LaserJet's internal Line Printer font, for instance, wouldbe \027(8U \027andamp;k2SandM;A setup string doesn't have to be put into the worksheet, but it does have tobe entered from the Print submenu's Setup function.andP;  A setup string to printa spreadsheet on legal-size paper, manually fed into the printer, inlandscape mode using the Line Printer font at 8 lines per inch, would be\027E \027andamp;l2h84p1o8D \027(8U \027andamp;k2SandM;Word PowerandM;Microsoft Word anticipated the increased typographic powers of laserprinters.andP;  Other word processors allow you to use multiple fonts in adocument, but Word makes it easy.andP;  There's no need to keep notes on whichfonts you have available--Word supplies you with a list, using the FormatCharacter command.andP;  Nor do you need to exit the program to install adifferent printer driver; pressing Print Options (F1) shows you the list ofoptions available and lets you select one.andM;START WITH THE DRIVERandM;It's easy to get Word to recognize any LaserJet font cartridge or soft font.andO;That's because Word comes with drivers for all the cartridges and soft fontsoffered by Hewlett-Packard, and companies selling soft fonts almostinvariably provide a Word driver generator.andM;One of the beauties of Word is that a new driver can be combined with anexisting driver.andP;  This lets you use fonts from two different cartridgessimultaneously, or combine soft fonts and cartridge fonts.andP;  Copy the MERGEPRDfile from Word's Utility disk to your hard disk.andP;  Then from the DOS prompttype MERGEPRD and follow the prompts to combine .PRD files or to add ordelete fonts.andM;In order to embed the escape character in a document (to send controlcommands to the printer), just hold down the Alt key and type 27 on thenumeric keypad.andM;DESIGNER SHEETSandM;Style-sheet formatting is one of the most labor-saving ways to use theLaserJet with Microsoft Word.andP;  Using style sheets may seem laborious atfirst, but with some practice it becomes second nature.andP;  You'll soon findthat creating documents is much easier when you separate the work of creatingtext from the work of formatting it.andP;  Most documents pass through severalstages.andP;  In the first few rounds, you're concerned with editing andproofreading.andP;  For this stage you can either use no style or create a verysimple style, such as double-spaced Courier for all text elements.andP;  When youfinally format the document, the formats established in the style sheet willstandardize elements within the document, producing a clean and professionalpiece.andP;  If you want to fine-tune certain elements, such as subheadindentation or table tabs, you can alter these details once in the stypesheet rather than labor over individual elements.andM;For example, if you set all your subheads in 12-point bold and want to changethem to 14-point bold, you don't have to go through the document changingeach one.andP;  Instead, you merely change the subhead style and watch all thesubheads automatically switch to the new point size.andM;dBASE dTailsandM;The same capabilities that make the LaserJet so useful with Lotus1-2-3--formatting output and printing in landscape mode--also make it astrong supporter for dBASE operations such a printing reports or labels.andO;dBASE IV, the newest version of dBASE, incorporates a printer driver thatmakes talking to a LaserJet a simpler matter, although this driver supportsonly basic formatting commands and still may not be entirely sufficient foryour needs.andM;If you're using dBASE II, III, or III Plus, or if you need to go beyond thecapabilities of the dBASE IV printer drivers, you need to send PCL codes toyour printer.andP;  These codes are also referred to as &quot;escape sequences&quot; becausethey always begin with the escape character, ASCII 27.andP;  Since it is possibleto use the CHR() function of dBASE to send any character to a printer, youcan send the escape character to the LaserJet with the function CHR(27).andM;MAKING YOUR ESCAPEandM;To send an entire escape sequence to the LaserJet, use an output command tosend output to the printer, followed by CHR(27) and whatever other charactersmust be sent, all in double or single quotes, since they form a characterstring.andP;  For example, if you want to send Escape-E, the sequence that resetsthe LaserJet to its default parameters, you would first Set Print On to makesure the sequence reached the printer, and then issue the command ?andP;  CHR(27)+ 'E'andM;MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THISandM;Once you have determined the escape sequences you need for various tasks,it's best to store them in memory variables.andP;  When you need to send a controlstring, you can use the ? command and the substitution function andamp; to retrievethe contents of the memory variable.andM;For example, the LaserJet escape sequence to select landscape mode isandless;ESCAPEandgt; andamp;l1O.andP;  The corresponding dBASE string is CHR(27) + 'andamp;l1O'.andP;  You canstore this sequence to a memory variable named LJETLAND with the commandSTORE &quot;CHR(27) + 'andamp;l1O'&quot; TO LJETLANDandM;After that, you can send the string whenever you need to merely by entering ?andO;andamp;LJEDLANDandM;TOTAL RECALLandM;Once you've taken the time to figure out the memory variables you need andhave created them, you can use the Save and Restore commands of dBASE to savememory variables to a .MEM file on disk and recall them whenever you needthem.andP;  Because of the syntax of the Save and Restore commands, you'll find ituseful to give your LaserJet memory variables similar names, so that you caneasily distinguish them from your other memory variables.andP;  For example, youmight want to name your variables LJET1, LJET2, LJET3, and on on.andP;  This willlet you use the All Like clause of the Save command, so you can savevariables whose names begin with LJET.andM;THE SHORT FORMandM;There are two ways that people use dBASE to obtain reports from a database.andO;Most commonly, people use the Create Report command to create a report formdescribing the data and its appearance on the printed page.andP;  Once a reportform exists, the Report Form ...andP;  To Print command runs the report and sendsit ot the printer.andM;The dBASE III Plus report form command lets you incorporate short&quot;expressions,&quot; or character strings, into your reports.andP;  In this way you canembed the escape character followed by whatever other characters you need.andO;But there are a couple of problems: the expressions you embed cannot be verylong and cannot contain memory variables.andP;  Also, the only places where anexpression may be entered are within a column, as a column heading, or as apage title.andM;PROGRAMMED LEARNINGandM;A second, much more flexible way of creating a report is to writeh a dBASEprogram to output the data.andP;  Such a program can also incorporate LaserJetformatting commands, including commands to switch between landscape andportrait mode, select fonts, and set margins.andM;It is also possible to save some effort by combining the report form approachwith the programming approach.andP;  Use the Create Report command to define howyou want your data to appear--and any necessary LaserJet formattingcodes--but don't use it to put in LaserJet setup instructions.andP;  Next, write asimple dBASE program that sends the necessary setup escape sequences to theLaserJet, then runs the report using the Report Form ...andP;  To Print command.andM;WordPerfectionandM;Before Release 5.0 of WordPerfect, Microsoft Word was unrivaled in itssupport of the LaserJet.andP;  But WordPerfect 5.0 is roughly equal to Word inmost regards and superior in others.andM;Before you can start printing with WordPerfect, you have to set up what'sknown as a printer file, or .PRS file.andP;  As you select fonts for your printerfile, notice that WordPerfect keeps track of how much memory they'll take upin the LaserJet.andP;  If your printer has 512KB of memory (the standardconfiguration for the LaserJet Plus or LaserJet II), you will be limited toabout 350KB for fonts.andP;  If you've added a 1MB memory board, you can increasethe amount of storage available to about 1MB.andM;GETTING THE LEAD OUT -- OR INandM;Leading is the amount of space between lines of type.andP;  Before the days oflaser printers, leading did not need to be adjused, because vertical linespacing was usually either six or eight lines to the inch.andP;  But with varioustype sizes in a document, the leading must change so letters on one linedon't overlap those on another.andM;WordPerfect automatically adjusts the leading allotted to a line to match thelargest font used in that line.andP;  to override the automatic setting, selectFormat/Line/Line Height, and enter the desired leading.andP;  If the measurementshown is in inches, you can still enter a new figure in points: if you type15p, for example, WordPerfect will convert the 15p to inches.andP;  (Points arethe standard unit of measure for typefonts--there are 72 points to an inch.andO;WordPerfect 5.0 measures leading from the baseline of one line of type to thebaseline of the next.)andM;For proper leading, you normally add two or three points to the size of thefont.andP;  However, the appearance of a document can frequently be improveddramatically by increasing the leading.andP;  For instance, 15 points of leadingfor a 12-point font can result in a more readable document than 13 points ofleading.andM;MERGERMANIAandM;WordPerfect 5.0's ability to merge graphics into text files compares quitefavorably even with the advanced graphics features of high-end desktoppublishing programs like PageMaker and Ventura Publisher.andP;  The Graphicscommand is the starting point for merging graphics into text, creating boxes,creating ruling lines, or creating tables.andP;  To merge a graphic into a page oftext, you select Graphics/Figure/Create, then specify the name of the filecontaining the graphic, the location of the graphic, the size, whether youwant text to wrap around, and whether you want a caption.andM;Once you have created the graphic using these steps, theGraphics/Figure/Options command lets you adjust spacing around the graphic,create a box around it, add shading, and more.andP;  The Graphics/Figure/Editcommand lets you rotate the graphic, shift its position within a box, orchange its size.andM;A MOTION TO TABLEandM;WordPerfect uses the same general approach for creating lines, boxes, andtables that it uses for creating graphics.andP;  Select the Graphics command, thenchoose Table, Box, or Line.andP;  If you're setting up a table, you'll be providedwith a special editing screen for typing in the contents.andP;  When you go backto working on your main document, you won't actually see the content of thetable you've created but you will be able to refer to it with preview mode.andO;Boxes can be freely positioned on the page, and ruling lines can be placedeither vertically or horizontally, along the left margin, between columns,along the right margin, or at another specified location.andM;BACKSEAT DRIVERandM;Older copies of WordPerfect 4.2 came without a driver for the new LaserJetII.andP;  If your copy of the program puts you in this situation, select theLaserJet Reg, +, 500+, A: PC Courier printer definition.andP;  This definition isthe closest to the LaserJet II internal fonts.andP;  And contact the WordPerfectCorporation for a free updated version of their LaserJet printer drivers.andO;(This is best done by mail: write to WordPerfect Corporatin, 1555 N.andO;Technology Way, Orem, Utah 84057.)andM;Sticky BusinessandM;Envelopes and labels present the LaserJet--and all laser printers--with somespecial problems.andP;  The heat and pressure that a laser printer applies toanything fed through it means that the thickness of envelopes and labelsheets and the adhesives used on them can cause printer jams.andM;Using lighter stock can help.andP;  Envelopes should be the commercial or officialtype, with diagonal seams and gummed flaps.andP;  Avoid envelopes with side seams,multiple flaps, transparent windows, or attachments such as strings or metalclasps.andM;Standard pin-feed labels don't work well in the LaserJet, which shouldn't benews.andP;  More surprising is the fact that the label sheets created forphotocopiers may not work well either.andM;You should use labels that have an acrylic-based adhesive, which is leastlikely to break down at the high temperatures the LaserJet uses to fuse toneronto paper.andP;  You should also use labels that do not let the adhesive comeinto direct contact with any part of the printer, such as the print drum orrollers.andP;  And the labels should cover the entire page, with no spaces betweenthem.andM;THE ENVELOPE, PLEASEandM;The simplest way to print envelopes is to create a plain-ASCII file with theaddress and the necessary escape codes, then copy the file to the printer.andO;You can create this file with any word processor (the command string has beenseparated into individual lines for clarity--it should include carriagereturns only after the data items): andless;ESCAPEandgt;E andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l1O andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l3Handless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l81A andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;a35L andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l12E Name Company AddressandM;This file will print the destination address on envelopes on the LaserJetII--just substitute the real mailing address for the lines labeled Name,Company, and Address.andP;  A file for envelopes that includes the return addresscould look something like this: andless;ESCAPEandgt;E andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l1O andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l3Handless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l14A andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;a5L andless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;l2E Name Street/PO Town, State, Zipandless;ESCAPEandgt;andamp;a35L [Insert six carriage returns here] Name Street/PO Town, State,ZipandM;If you want to use a font other than Courier, you'll need to insert thatescape sequence as a separate line above the name.andP;  Save this file asEnvelope (or whatever) on your hard disk.andP;  Each time you need to print anenvelope, type the new address over the previous one, save it, and use theDOS COPY/B command to copy the address to the printer.andM;OFF YOUR FEED?andM;However you set up your address file, when it's sent to the LaserJet theprinter will display a blinking PE on the control panel.andP;  Position theenvelope with the flap side underneath and the stamp end entering the printerfirst, against the left side of the manual-feed tray (the same side as theindicator panel and the power switch).andP;  Gently push the envelope into thefeed until you hear a click.andP;  The rollers will turn for five or six seconds,then the printer will pull the envelope into the feed.andP;  If you are printingmore than one envelope, you can feed another one in as soon as the last ispulled out of the printer.andP;  After the LaserJet prints the leter, the PEindictor on the control panel will turn itself off.andM;MARGIN OF DIFFERENCEandM;There are some significant and some insignificant differences betweenphotocopier labels and laser printer labels.andP;  One obvious difference is thatat the top of a sheet of laser printer labels is a row of half-height labels.andO;This row accounts for the LaserJet's unprintable area, a half-inch-widemargin at the top and bottom within which the LaserJet cannot print an image.andM;With either laser printer labels or photocopier labels you must adjust yoursoftware to account for this margin, but with photocopier labels you wastethe top and bottom rows of labels.andP;  Using laser printer labels, you wastejust two half-rows of labels, or one row in all.andM;TAILGATING ALLOWEDandM;Whether you're printing envelopes or labels, always make sure that you lowerthe rear output tray of the LaserJet II first, so that they are ejected flatout of the back of the LaserJet and donht have to negotiate the last hairpinbend as they normally would.andP;  This greatly increases the chances of yourlabel sheet making it through the process without losing a label and gummingup the printer.andM;Getting the Right Picture with Shift-PrtScandM;Taking a screenshot is the simplest way to transfer material directly fromthe monitor screen to the printer--just press the Shift-PrtSc combination.andM;Unfortunately, because the character set used by the IBM Monochrome Display(as well as monitors that emulate that display) doesn't contain the samecharacters as the Roman-8 character set used by the LaserJet's defaultCourier font, graphics characters such as the border lines around the screenused by many programs print on the LaserJet as odd alphabetic characters.andM;With older versions of the LaserJet, the only fixes are either laborious orexpensive.andP;  Happily, the newer LaserJet II model provides a built-in fontthat uses a chracter set that exactly matches the IBM-US character set.andM;To switch the printer to the new character set, take the printer off-line bypressing the On Line key, then press the Menu key for about five seconds,until the display panel reads SYM SET=.andP;  PRess the Plus key repeatedly untilthe display reads SYM SET=IBM-US.andP;  Then press the Enter/Reset Menu key sothat an asterisk appears next to IBM-US, and then press the On Line key.andM;If you attempt to use Shift-PrtSc at this point, you'll still get the oldcharacter set.andP;  Although the character set has been changed, the printerstill has to be reset.andP;  So, press the On Line key again, then press and holdContinue/Reset for about five seconds, until the panel reads 07 RESET.andP;  Whenyou release the key, the panel display will change to READY.andM;Now the printer is reconfigured so that the IBM-US set is the defaultcharacter set.andM;To capture a text screen, verify that the printer is online (the On Linelight is lit) then press Shift-PrtSc on the computer's keyboard.andP;  The FormFeed light should then go on, indicating that the printer has received thescreen, but the paper will not eject.andP;  To eject the page, take the printeroffline by pressing the On Line key, then press the Form Feed key and pressthe On Line key again.andM;PCL CommandsandM;The LaserJet is controlled by a set of commands called the Printer CommandLanguage (PCL).andP;  Each PCL command starts with an andless;EXCAPEandgt; character--ASCII27.andP;  Each time the LaserJet receive an andless;ESCAPEandgt; character, it examines thefollowing sequence of characters up to the next capital letter to see if thesequence is a PCL command.andP;  If so, the command is executed.andP;  If not, it isignored.andM;PCL commands can be passed to the printer either as &quot;setup strings,&quot; whichare commands that are sent to the printer and executed immediately, or as&quot;embedded commands,&quot; which are text strings placed in a file that have noeffect until the file is printed on the LaserJet.andM;Most programs provide a way of using PCL commands as either setup strings orembedded commands, or both, and examples for some applications are includedin this excerpt.andM;The most common cause of problems with PCL commands is that they have beenaccidentally entered incorrectly.andP;  It is particularly easy to confuse thelowercase letter l with the numeral 1 and the capital letter O with thenumeral 0.andP;  Because the Printer Command Language looks for capital letters,you should always type a letter in capitals if it is so indicated.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
