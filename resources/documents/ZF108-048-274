(semiconductor technology )</TITLE><AUTHOR>Clifford, Leon.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>As the number of transistors that can be packed on a chipcontinues to double every 18 months, software developers are goingto find it harder and harder to keep pace with the expandedcapabilities.andP;  Developments such as Intel's 586 processor will beof little use to microcomputers that do not even have any softwareto support the 486 processor.andP;  Until software is available, itwill be minicomputers, superminicomputers and workstations thatwill benefit from the increased memory.andP;  Computer makers will alsostart linking cheap microprocessors into multi-microprocessormachines that will have the capabilities of mainframes at afraction of the price.andP;  For their part, chip makers will push on,with 4M-bit DRAMs in production this year, and 16M-bit DRAMsavailable as samples.andP;  Intel will also introduce its Flashtechnology which could start to replace hard disks in somecomputers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MemoryDRAMFuture TechnologiesSoftware DesignMicroprocessors.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
