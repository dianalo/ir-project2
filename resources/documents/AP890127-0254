Glenn McLoughlin, a staff member with the Science Policy ResearchDivision of the library's Congressional Research Service, disclosedThursday that a virus was spotted and killed out of the main catalogcomputer system last fall before it could inflict any damage to datafiles.   ``It was identified before it could spread or permanently eraseany data,'' he told a delegation of Japanese computer specialiststouring this country to assess the virus problem.   The Library of Congress, with a staff of about 5,000 people,annually receives more than 1 million books, magazines, newspapersand other items from around the globe. It has a variety of computersystems to help handle the massive information base.   McLoughlin said the virus was found after personnel logging ontocomputers at the library noticed they had substantially lesscomputer memory space to work with than they had expected.   The virus apparently entered the system through a piece ofsoftware obtained from the University of Maryland, McLoughlin said.   ``We don't know whether it was a student at Maryland, or whetherMaryland had gotten it from somebody else,'' he said. ``That wassimply the latest point of departure for the software.''   Viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can bestealthily inserted into programs, causing various problemsincluding destruction of data and sudden clogging of a computer'smemory with thousands of copies of the virus.   Another computer security specialist addressing Thursday'sbriefing said the world may be heading toward a catastrophiccomputer failure unless more effective measures are taken to combatviruses.   Professor Lance J. Hoffman of George Washington Universitylikened the virus which struck the Pentagon's computer network lastNovember to a frightening nuclear accident, and said it ``could havehad very disastrous consequences for our society.''   ``It wasn't Chernobyl yet, it was the Three Mile Island _ it wokea lot of people up,'' Hoffman said.</TEXT></DOC>
