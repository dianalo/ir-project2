Where there are coinsurance provisions, they trackas much as possible provisions in the coinsurance programs now applicableto multifamily housing projects, i.e., 24 CFR Parts 251 and 255, with somemajor differences including changes in the Sound Capital Resources requirements,the creation of a dedicated account for coinsurance obligations, and otherchanges, all of which are discussed in detail below.

L. 93-383) amended the National Housing Actby adding a new section 244 entitled, ``Coinsurance.'' Section 244 authorizesthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to insure, under any provisionof Title II of the National Housing Act, any mortgage otherwise eligibleunder that title, pursuant to a Coinsurance Contract that provides thatthe lender (1) assume a percentage of any loss (and share in Mortgage InsurancePremium income) and (2) carry out (subject to audit and review requirements)such delegated processing functions as the Secretary approves.The Department has previously undertaken a number of coinsurance initiativesunder the section 244 authority and is currently operating three coinsuranceprograms. Regulations issued on February 12, 1976 (41 FR 6446) added anew Part 204 in Title 24 of the CFR that initiated a program of coinsurancefor one-to-four family dwellings insured under section 203 of the NationalHousing Act. Regulations originally issued on July 2, 1980 (45 FR 45117)added a new Part 255 that authorized a program of ``Coinsurance for thePurchase or Refinancing of Existing Multifamily Housing Projects.'' Part255 permits qualified lending institutions to coinsure and perform delegatedprocessing on mortgage loans on existing multifamily projects using sections207 and 223(f) of the National Housing Act as the insuring authorities.It was extensively amended on March 31, 1982 (47 FR 13519), May 25, 1983(48 FR 23399), and June 24, 1985 (50 FR 25924).A new Part 251 was added on August 9, 1984 (49 FR 32023) as a companionto Part 255. It authorizes a program of coinsurance for newly constructedor susbstantially rehabilitated multifamily projects insured under section221(d)(3) or section 221(d)(4) of the National Housing Act. Part 251, alongwith current Part 255, is available to HUD-approved private lenders andState Housing Agencies; both programs are in operation and very active.The Department has moved forward in implementing multifamily coinsurancebased on a general policy of delegating to participating FHA lenders thoseprocessing and underwriting functions that lenders are capable of performingin accordance with HUD criteria, but without HUD staff involvement. Basedon the Department's successful experience with Parts 251 and 255, it isnow extending the coinsurance concept to another currently active multifamilyfull insurance program_Section 232 for nursing homes, intermediate carefacilities and board and care homes.The addition of this new Part 252 will result in a comprehensive HUD policywith respect to delegated processing. For the lender groups now eligibleto coinsure section 223(f) and/or section 221(d) mortgages, it offers acoinsurance vehicle for also financing nursing homes and similar facilitiesnow eligible only under section 232 full insurance. For the most part,this new Part 252 does not differ in substance from 24 CFR Part 232 (fullinsurance nursing homes). It has, however, been reorganized and rewrittento follow the format and ``plain English'' style of Parts 251 and 255 inorder to emphasize the fact that all coinsurance programs share the samecoinsurance policy framework, one in which lenders agree to share the insurancerisk and in return are permitted to perform underwriting and servicingfunctions with minimal Federal involvement.In this Part 252, the requirements concerning property eligibility, mortgageterms and cost limits, eligibility and regulation of mortgagors, insuranceof advances, inspections and cost certification primarily track similarrequirements found in the section 232 full insurance program. With respectto lender eligibility and contract rights, Part 252 draws upon the existingParts 251 and 255 coinsurance provisions with some significant revisionswhich are discussed below. There are similar provisions with respect toauthorization of full or partial reinsurance at the lender's option; acquisitionand sale of properties by the lender (not HUD) after default_includingclaims settlement formula and risk share; restrictions on the assignmentof coinsured mortgages to other lenders; lender obligation to bear a deductibleof 5 percent of unpaid mortgage balance at default; and HUD guaranteesto GNMA providing protection against coinsurance losses. On December 31, 1987 a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> which would authorize under Part 232 the refinancingor purchase of existing presently HUD-insured nursing homes and relatedfacilities and which would establish a new Part 252 authorizing the coinsuranceof nursing homes and related facilities. This rule makes final_with significantmodifications described below_that proposed rule. A careful review of the public comments received on the December 31, 1987proposed rule, as well as internal HUD reassessment of that proposal, hasresulted in a number of significant revisions to the original proposedrule. Among the revisions reflected in this final rule are: (1) A requirement to establish a dedicated account, funded initially withat least $500,000 of the initial $1.5 million in liquid funds requiredfor Sound Capital Resources. The account will be increased by a depositat the time each case is closed in an amount of $1 for each $150 of principalindebtedness until the account reaches $3 million. Thereafter, a depositof $1 for each $300 in newly closed principal indebtedness will be required.In addition, an amount equivalent to four years of the lender's share ofannual MIP must be deposited in the dedicated account. (2) Individual mortgage limitations based on the lender's Sound CapitalResources will be imposed. A new andSection; 252.110 has been added providingthat mortgages may not exceed $10 million per case until Sound CapitalResources reach $2 million; $15 million per case until Sound Capital Resourcesreach $2.5 million; and $20 million per case until Sound Capital Resourcesreach $3 million. Once Sound Capital Resources reach $3 million, therewill be no specific limitations on mortgage amount. (3) Under the existing coinsurance provisions, when a lender disposes ofa project through a competitive bid procedure, the amount which may bededucted for purposes of calculating the insurance claims payment is thesales price of the property, even if this price is lower than the property'sappraised value. This was revised in the proposed rule to base the deductionon the higher of the sales price or the appraised value as is now donein negotiated sale situations. This final rule does not follow the proposedrule but rather tracks the existing coinsurance provisions. (4) Under the proposed rule, the current HUD claims settlement of 85 percentof loss (72.25 percent if the lender carries reinsurance at more than 50percent or the maximum permitted by State law) would have been revisedto provide HUD settlement at 75 percent of loss (or 62.25 percent for reinsurance).A corresponding change would have been made in the proposed rule to sharemortgage insurance premiums on a basis of 70 percent to HUD and 30 percentto the Lender. This final rule maintains the current HUD claims settlementof 85 (72.25) percent of loss as well as the 80:20 MIP share ratio. (5) The proposed rule would have allowed a mortgagor to refinance an existingproperty up to 70 percent of the lender's estimated value of the propertywithout cost justification. The final rule eliminates that criterion asa limiting factor. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comparison of This Final Rule to Earlier Proposed Rule </ITAG>This final rule consists of two parts. First, a new Subpart E is addedto 24 CFR Part 232_Mortgage Insurance for Nursing Homes, Intermediate CareFacilities, and Board and Care Homes_to implement HUD's authority to offerfull insurance of purchases or refinancings covering currently insuredprojects under that part. Second, the rule establishes a new program ofcoinsurance of mortgages covering newly constructed, substantially rehabilitatedor currently insured nursing homes, intermediate care facilities and boardand care homes. In addition, several conforming changes to Parts 251 and 255 have beenincluded in this rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">New Subpart E to 24 CFR Part 232 </ITAG>This subpart consists of six sections. Section 232.901 states that notwithstandingthe otherwise applicable requirement that mortgages insured under Part232 cover only newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated Projects,a mortgage insured under this subpart may be executed in connection withthe purchase or refinancing of presently insured Projects pursuant to section223(f) of the National Housing Act. Section 232.902 describes what is meantby an existing Project and distinguishes such projects from those whichare ``substantially rehabilitated.'' Section 232.903 sets forth maximuminsurable mortgage amounts. Section 232.904 sets a mortgage term of notless than 10 nor more than the lesser of 35 years or 75 percent of theestimated remaining economic life of the project. This requirement is similarto that in the existing multifamily coinsurance program (see andSection;255.205). Section 232.905 exempts mortgages insured under this new SubpartE from the otherwise applicable labor standards and prevailing wage requirementsfound in andSection;andSection; 232.70-74. A similar provision is containedin Part 255 (see andSection; 255.209). Section 232.906 sets forth processingand commitment procedures. It is based upon andSection; 207.32a(a) in title24 of the CFR, which authorizes full FHA insurance for the purchase orrefinancing of existing multifamily housing projects. The provisions of this new Subpart E in the final rule are the same asthose contained in the proposed rule with the significant exception thatthe final rule strikes the provision in andSection; 232.903(e)(1) authorizinga refinancing mortgage without cost justification of up to 70 percent ofthe Commissioner's estimate of the value of the project. <ITAG tagnum="84">New Part 252 to Title 24 of the CFR </ITAG>As was noted earlier in this Preamble, this new coinsurance program followsthe existing full insurance nursing homes program and tracks existing coinsuranceprovisions found in 24 CFR Parts 251 and 255 with some significant coinsurancerevisions. The revisions are limited to this new program. They relate mainlyto the coinsuring lender's financial requirements and are described indetail below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General Provisions </ITAG>Section 252.1 Purpose and Scope In the proposed rule, coinsurance provisions comparable to those in andSection;andSection;251.1 and 255.1 would apply under the new part. (No comparable Part 232section.) The final rule removes paragraph (c) referencing Section 244(c) of theNational Housing Act. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987repealed section 244(c), therefore this rule deletes the referencing paragraphin this new Part 252. Section 252.2 Coinsurance Contract In the final rule, as in the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection;251.2 and 255.2 would apply under the new part. (No comparable Part 232section.)Section 252.3 DefinitionsIn the final rule, as in the proposed rule, the definitions in Part 251of ``Builder's and Sponsor's Profit and Risk Allowance'', ``Builder-sellerMortgagor'', ``Cooperative Mortgagor'', ``General Mortgagor'', ``Investor-sponsorMortgagor'', ``Limited Distribution Mortgagor'', and ``Sponsor's Profitand Risk Allowance'', contained in Parts 251 and 255 would not be usedin this section.The definitions in Parts 251 and 255 of ``Coinsured Mortgage'', ``Distribution'',``Firm Commitment'', ``Sound Capital Resources'', and ``Substantial Rehabilitation''are adopted for use in this section except that the $6,500 per dwellingunit requirement for ``substantial rehabilitation'' is deleted as inapplicableto the types of projects covered in the new Part 252.Definitions of ``Nursing Home'', ``Intermediate Care Facility'', ``Boardand Care Home'', ``Project'', and ``State'' would be added in this section.They are essentially the same as the definitions used in the Part 232 fullinsurance program.The final rule also adds to this section definitions of ``Public mortgagor''and ``Residual receipts''. The latter had been omitted inadvertently fromthe proposed rule. ``Public mortgagor'' has been added to the final rulebased on statutory changes in mortgagor eligibility made in the Housingand Community Development Act of 1987.Section 252.4 Effect of AmendmentsIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection;251.4and 255.4 would apply under the new part. [The comparable Part 232 sectionis andSection;232.96.]Final rule makes no change in this provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Lender Requirements</ITAG>Section 252.101 Eligible LenderThe proposed rule contained outdated provisions from andSection;andSection;251.101and 255.101. (The comparable Part 232 section is 232.1(c).)The final rule has been corrected to include provisions from the currentandSection;andSection;251.101 and 255.101.Section 252.102 Review and Approval as Coinsuring LenderIn the proposed rule, except for the Sound Capital Resources Requirement,provisions comparable to andSection;andSection;251.102 and 255.102 would applyto mortgagees approved as coinsuring lenders under the new part. (No comparablePart 232 section.)Under the proposed rule, liquid assets of $1,500,000 (rather than $500,000as in the 221(d) and 223(f) coinsurance programs) would have been requiredto meet the Sound Capital Resources requirement. Also, an additional onedollar in liquid assets would have been required for each $200 (ratherthan $300) in outstanding principal indebtedness of a lender's coinsuredmortgages.Under the final rule, liquid assets of $1,500,000 will still be requiredto meet the Sound Capital Resources requirement. The lender must also establishand maintain a dedicated account for coinsurance obligations, funded initiallywith at least $500,000 of the liquid funds. The lender must make depositsto and maintain the dedicated account at a level of an additional $1 foreach $150 of newly closed principal indebtedness until the account reaches$3 million and $1 per $300 thereafter. An amount equivalent to four yearsof the lender's share of annual MIP must also be deposited in the dedicatedaccount. At the lender's option, the deposit may be made at closing orin increments within four years of closing. Potential sources for the additionaldeposit include the lender's share of annual MIP, the lender's premium,or letters of credit converted to cash at the end of the four-year period.The dedicated account will be credited toward the lender's Sound CapitalResources requirement.Withdrawals from the dedicated account will be restricted to purposes ofmeeting the lender's coinsurance obligations as specified in the programhandbook.Further, the final rule adds a paragraph similar to that contained in thecorresponding sections in Parts 251 and 255 requiring HUD approval beforeany transfer of lender assets which would affect Sound Capital Resources.Finally, the proposed rule would have required that <T3>technical</T3> staff experienced in the operation and management ofthe facilities covered under this Part 252, be in the direct employ ofthe lender. The final rule requires that the lender have in its own employstaff who have broad experience in the development/management/operationof residential healthcare facilities and who are able to analyze data onan individual project provided by technical experts (who may be under contractor in the employ of the lender).Section 252.103 Duration of ApprovalIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection;251.103and 255.103 would also apply to coinsuring lenders approved under the newpart. (No comparable Part 232 section.)No change in final rule.Section 252.104 Withdrawal of ApprovalIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection;251.104and 255.104 would apply to coinsuring lenders approved under the new part.No change in final rule. In addition, specific langauge regarding non-maintenanceof the dedicated account for coinsurance obligations (andSection;252.102(a)(3))has been added to the final rule. Failure to properly maintain this accountis added as a ground for withdrawal of lender approval, and increased depositrequirements as a potential condition of a lender's probation. (No comparablePart 232 section.)Section 252.105 Delegation of ServicingIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection;251.105and 255.105 would apply under the new rule. (No comparable Part 232 section.)Final rule makes no change in this provision.Section 252.106 Assignment of and Participation in Coinsured MortgagesThe proposed rule contained outdated provisions from andSection;andSection;251.106 and 255.106.Final rule reflects minor changes from proposed to track verbatim revisedandSection;andSection; 251.106 and 255.106.Section 252.107 ReinsuranceIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.107and 255.107 would apply to coinsuring lenders approved under the new part.(No comparable Part 232 section.)Final rule makes no change in this provision.Section 252.108 Pledging and Other Security ArrangementsIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.108and 255.108 would apply to coinsuring lenders approved under the new part.(No comparable Part 232 section but 232 does reference back to Part 207.See andSection;andSection; 232.251 and 207.261.)Final rule makes no change in this provision.Section 252.109 Minimum Principal Loan Amount.Section 419 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 prohibitsa mortgagee or lender from requiring, as a condition of providing a loaninsured under the NHA or secured by a mortgage insured under the NHA, thatthe principal amount of the loan exceed a minimum amount established bythe mortgagee or lender. The provision also prohibits a mortgagee fromrequiring a minimum principal amount to be outstanding on the loan securedby the existing mortgage. The final rule adds this section implementingthese statutory provisions.Section 252.110 Limitations on Individual Mortgage AmountsThe final rule adds a provision not found in the proposed rule providingthat mortgages may not exceed $10 million per case until Sound CapitalResources reach $2 million, $15 million per case until Sound Capital Resourcesreach $2.5 million, and $20 million per case until Sound Capital Resourcesreach $3 million. Once $3 million is reached, there will be no specificlimitations on the mortgage amount.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Program Requirements</ITAG>Section 252.201 Eligible ProjectIn the proposed rule, paragraph (a) of this section generally would havetracked the existing andSection;232.39. However, the Department sought publiccomment on alternative versions of subparagraph (a)(2) as it related tooccupancy density requirements for board and care homes. Alternative Aof the rule text would have provided for a maximum ratio of four personsper bedroom and per full bathroom in the facility. Alternative B wouldhave offered this four-person per bedroom and per bathroom standard asa suggested norm, but it would only be the rule in those States where specificstandards, as promulgated under section 1616(e) of the Social SecurityAct, did not exist. Where State standards were in place, Alternative Bwould defer to the State requirement.Alternative A is contained in the final rule. This alternative conformswith the provision in Part 232 which governs the full insurance program.The full insurance provision was adopted in 1985 after considerable publiccomment, and given the limited public comment to the alternatives presentedin the proposed rule (2 in support of Alternative B and 1 in support ofa more restrictive Alternative A), we do not feel it is appropriate tochange the outstanding policy as contained in Part 232. This will providea uniform underwriting base for all HUD-insured and coinsured board andcare homes.The occupancy density and facility-type standards established by Statesand localities, by a large, address health and safety concerns. They varywidely from State to State, and from locality to locality (each State maydesignate one <T3>or more</T3> State or local authorities which can establish and enforcestandards). The requirements tend to be more restrictive in many jurisdictionsthan those in Alternative A. While the Department equally shares the concernfor human safety, our standards must also address the property as securityfor a coinsured mortgage. Therefore, we have decided to retain the one-to-fourperson per bedroom occupancy and to set the maximum ratio of four personsto every full bath. The facility must also adhere to State and local occupancyrequirements if a stricter degree of regulation is required under Stateor local law.(b) Provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.201(b) and 255.201(b)would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (No comparable Part232 section.) The final rule makes no change in this paragraph.(c) Provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.201(c) and 255.201(c)would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (No comparable Part232 section.) The final rule makes no change in this paragraph.(d) Provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.201(d) and 255.201(d)would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (No comparable Part232 section.) The final rule makes no change in this paragraph.(e) Provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.201(e) and 255.201(e)would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (No comparable Part232 section.) The final rule makes no change in this paragraph.Section 252.202 Eligible MortgagorsIn the proposed rule, this section tracked the existing andSection;232.20.The word ``public'' is added to this section in the final rule based onstatutory changes imposed by the HCD Act of 1987 expanding mortgagor eligibilityunder the nursing home program to ``public mortgagors''.Section 252.203 Maximum Mortgage LimitationsIn the proposed rule, the mortgage is limited to a principal obligationnot in excess of 90 percent of the lender's estimate of the value of theproperty or project, including equipment to be used in its operation, whenthe proposed improvements are completed and the equipment is installed.(This section is based upon andSection;232.30.)The final rule retains the 90 percent of value wording and also includesthe specific provisions in andSection;255.203 (b) and (c) regarding Valueand Debt Service Limits. Additional limits imposed on rehabilitation projectstrack those in andSection;232.32 although the wording has been changed tothe plain English style of Parts 251 and 255.Section 252.204 Maximum Interest RateIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.204and 255.204 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (Thecomparable Part 232 section is 232.29.)The final rule makes no change in this section.Section 252.205 Term of the MortgageIn the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.205and 255.205 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (Thecomparable Part 232 section is 232.27.)The final rule makes no substantive change in this section. Section 252.206 Lenders Fees and Premiums In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.206and 255.206 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. (Thecomparable Part 232 sections are 232.10 and 232.12.) The final rule makes no change in this section. Section 252.207 Coinsurance of Mortgages in Lender's Portfolio In the proposed rule, generally, the provisions of andSection;andSection; 251.207and 255.207 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. Theonly difference is that mortgages in which no equity is removed would notbe subject to the one fourth limitation of paragraph (a)(2). The final rule makes no change in this section. Section 252.208 Nondiscrimination in Occupant Eligibility and EmploymentIn the proposed rule, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section wouldbe based upon andSection; 232.34. Paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) would be basedupon andSection;andSection; 251.208(c), (d) and (e) and 255.208 (c), (d) and(e). The final rule adds a paragraph requiring the mortgagor to certify it willnot sell the project as long as the mortgage is coinsured unless the purchaseragrees to comply with the requirements of this Part 252. (Based on andSection;andSection;251.208(g) and 255.208(g).) Section 252.209 Labor Standards and Prevailing Wage Requirements In the proposed rule, with the exception of mortgages coinsured under SubpartJ, the provisions of andSection; 251.209 would be applicable to mortgagescoinsured under the new part. (The comparable Part 232 sections are 232.70through 232.74.) The final rule makes no change in this section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Processing and Commitment </ITAG>Section 252.301 Processing and Development Responsibilities In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.301and 255.301 would be applicable to mortgages coinsured under the new part.(No comparable Part 232 section.) The final rule adds two provisions making the FHA Commissioner responsiblefor a market/submarket impact analysis of the proposed project and makingthe lender responsible for initiating the intergovernmental review processin certain cases. Section 252.302 Processing and Commitment In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.302and 255.302 would be applicable to mortgages coinsured under the new part.(No comparable Part 232 section.) The final rule makes no change in this section. Section 252.303 Required Certificates The proposed rule added a section to the basic Part 251 structure basedupon the current andSection; 232.6. It set forth the State certificationrequirements contained in Part 232. Section 410 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 revisedthe State certification requirements for nursing homes and related facilities.The final rule reflects these new statutory provisions. <ITAG tagnum="85">Subpart E_Insurance of Advances; Insurance Upon Completion; ConstructionPeriod </ITAG>Section 252.401 Insurance of Advances or Insurance Upon Completion;Applicability of Requirements In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.401and 255.401 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part.

The final rule makes a technical correction changing the word ``Commissioner''to ``lender'' regarding the determination of the application of net incomeprior to the beginning of amortization. Section 252.407 Endorsement by Commissioner In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.407and 255.407 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part.

Section 252.503 Mortgage Provisions In the proposed rule, except for paragraphs (i), (j) and (k), provisionscomparable to andSection;andSection; 251.503 and 255.503 would apply. The newparagraph 503(i) was based upon andSection; 232.37 and related to prepaymentprivileges and prepayment charges for the various categories of projectscovered in the new part, and allowed a prepayment lock-out and penaltyas agreed upon between the mortgagor and the coinsuring lender consistentwith HUD requirements. This differs from andSection; 232.37 where the mortgagormay prepay up to 15 percent in any calendar year without penalty. Paragraph(j) relating to late charges, was the same as andSection; 232.38a. Paragraph(k), on retaining property for residential purposes, was deleted. In the final rule, paragraph (j) relating to late charges was revised totrack the provisions found in andSection;andSection; 251.503(j) and 255.503(j).Also, paragraph (k) is inserted, similar to Parts 251 and 255, prohibitinguse of the project for any purpose other than as a residential care facilityeligible under this Part.

Section 252.701 General In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.701and 255.701 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part. The final rule makes no change in this section. Section 252.702 Reserve for Replacements and General Operating Reserve(a) In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to paragraph (a) of andSection;andSection;251.702 and 255.702 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part.The final rule inserts a requirement to include funds for the repair andreplacement of major movable equipment in the reserve for replacements,but is otherwise unchanged. (b) This paragraph remains reserved in the final rule. (c) In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to paragraph (c) of andSection;andSection;251.702 and 255.702 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part.(No comparable Part 232 provision.) The final rule makes no substantivechange in this paragraph. Section 252.703 Charges for Facilities and Services In the proposed rule, the mortgagor would determine charges taking intoaccount facilities and services offered by the Project. The final rule retains that provision and adds a new provision prohibitingthe collection of admission, founder, life-care or similar fees or payments.This prohibition has been a long-standing administrative policy and isconsistent with the similar prohibition at andSection; 251.703. Section 252.704 Use of Project Funds In the proposed rule, provisions comparable to andSection;andSection; 251.704and 255.704 would apply to mortgages coinsured under the new part.

The remaining paragraphs of that sectionwould not apply. The final rule makes no substantive change in this section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart I_Contract Rights and Obligations  </ITAG>In Part 232, the subject matter of Subpart I is covered by a referenceback to a similar subpart in Part 207. In developing the Part 251 and 255coinsurance programs, the Department considered what modifications in ``ContractRights and Obligations'' as found in Part 207, would be needed for coinsuranceand promulgated them as a Subpart I in both parts. In the proposed versionof this new Part 252, the Department incorporated the existing coinsuranceSubpart I with the following major exceptions.  (1) The coinsurance share ratios found in andSection;andSection;251.820 and255.820 (85 percent of loss_72.25 percent if the lender carries the maximumallowable reinsurance) were changed to a basic 75 percent of loss ratio.With reinsurance the new ratio would have been 62.25 percent (see new andSection;252.820). (2) The provisions in andSection;andSection;251.822(f) (1) and (2) and 255.822(f)(1) and (2), relating to amounts deductible where the lender must disposeof the project, were changed to require a deduction equal to the higherof the sales price or the appraised value of the property in every case(see new andSection;252.822(f)).  (3) Insurance benefits would be paid in cash unless the lender files awritten request for payment in debentures (see andSection;252.819).  In the final rule, items (1) and (2) above are changed. Instead of theproposed rule items, the analogous provisions found in Parts 251 and 255are adopted. The mortgage insurance premium split is also revised in thefinal rule to conform to Parts 251 and 255.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart J_Coinsurance of Mortgages Covering Existing Projects  </ITAG>In the proposed rule, this subpart consisted of six sections similar insequence and substance to those found in the new Subpart E to 24 CFR Part232 which was described above.  The final rule strikes the provision in andSection;252.903(c)(1) authorizinga refinancing mortgage without cost justification of up to 70 percent ofthe lender's estimate of value of the project.  Public Comments  A total of 18 public comments were received on this rule. Twelve were fromprivate businesses or corporations, five from national trade associationsor organizations, and one from a public entity. The comments raised thefollowing issues.  1. <T3>Coinsurance Risk Sharing Ratio_</T3>The proposed rule set forth a changein the risk sharing ratio from the 85:15 formula under the 221(d) and 223(f)Coinsurance programs to a 75:25 ratio under this Part. This was done notbecause the likelihood of default might be greater in this program, butrather that the relative loss on a healthcare facility might be greaterthan a housing project due to its limited reuse potential should a defaultoccur.  Six commenters strongly urged that the 75-25 percent coinsurance loss sharingratio contained in the proposed rule be changed to an 85-15 ratio_the sameas that which applies in the Part 251 and 255 multifamily rental coinsuranceprograms. They argued that the substantial financial exposure of the first5% of the outstanding mortgage balance plus 15% of any loss to the coinsureris sufficient to assure that coinsurers will properly underwrite the project.They feel the current risk-sharing formula is fair and any increase wouldbe unwarranted.  The commenters also pointed to the inconsistency among the coinsuranceprograms. It was felt also that this increase in liability on the partof the coinsurer would discourage participation by the larger, more highlycapitalized lenders based on a perceived increased likelihood of default. Many commenters cited historically lower rates of default in the fullyinsured nursing home program and the increasing elderly population as goodreasons for retaining the current 85:15 ratio which they consider incentiveenough for prudent underwriting.  Two commenters stated that their members have no experience to indicatethat healthcare facilities are more difficult to dispose of, or have alesser resale vale, in the event of default. In fact, one contends thatthere is a very strong market among nonprofit and proprietary healthcarechains for the acquisition of existing facilities.  The Department believes that with the addition of further mortgage limitations(andSection;252.903(c)(1)) and increased lender Sound Capital Resources requirements(andSection;252.102) in this final rule, the risk share can be maintainedat the 85:15 ratio urged by the commenters. This will, of course, resultin consistency with the Part 251 and 255 Coinsurance programs. The finalrule therefore provides for an 85:15 risk share ratio and the corresponding80:20 MIP split of Parts 251 and 255.  2. <T3>Section 233(f) Coinsurance and Full Insurance Should Not Be LimitedTo Previously Insured Projects._</T3>Nine commenters, while approving theprovisions in the proposed rule authorizing FHA insurance or coinsurancefor the purchase or refinancing of existing, HUD-insured nursing homesand similar facilities, strongly urged that this authority be expandedto also cover existing uninsured projects.  All of the commenters who provided comments on this issue indicated thatallowing purchase/refinancing of previously uninsured facilities underthis program would not increase the Department's risk.Most respondents indicated that uninsured existing facilities with proven``track records'' would provide a sound, low-risk portfolio for the lenderwhich would increase capitalization and improve the lender's ability tosustain projects in default.  The coinsurance programs under both Parts 251 and 255 were patterned onfull insurance programs which had been operating for some time. The Departmentdoes not have experience in the full insurance program with the purchaseand refinance of existing healthcare facilities. We feel that some experienceis necessary before we expand this program beyond the scope of previouslyinsured facilities. Therefore, the expansion of the program to uninsuredprojects shall not occur at this time.  In addition, we believe there is a need for more restrictive mortgage limitationson existing project refinancings to eliminate equity take-out.  One argument (reiterated by several commenters) for expansion of HUD'sresidential care programs into the purchase/refinancing of existing projectshas been that many facilities are substantially supported through Medicare/Medicaidpayments. By allowing refinancing of existing facilities to reduce interestrates (thereby lowering debt service), Federal dollars would be saved throughlowered Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement-based payments.  However, HUD's experience has been that, where equity take-out is allowed,HUD's share of the coinsurance risk will likely be greater than its currentexposure under full insurance on the same project as equity take-out createsa major upward force on mortgage amounts. So not only is the Department'sexposure actually increased, the Medicare/Medicaid payments which are basedin part on the pass-through of debt service are increased also.  By eliminating the mortgage criterion which allows for equity take-outin the refinancing of existing projects, as is done in this final rule,HUD will focus the coinsurance program on lowering financing costs (andFederal expenditures) while supporting needed repairs and rehabilitation.This is consistent with substantial rehabilitation mortgage limitationswhich do not allow equity take-out.  HUD, therefore, is revising the final rule so that only currently insuredexisting projects will be eligible for refinancing and purchase with themaximum mortgage amount limited to the lower of value (85%), debt service(85%), and cost to refinance (100%) or cost to acquire (85%).  3. <T3>Technical Staff Requirement. </T3>Thirteen commenters objected to theprovision in the rule requiring a lender to have in its own employ technicalstaff who are experienced in the operation/management and governmentalrequirements relating to nursing homes and similar facilities and urgedthat the lender be allowed to obtain such technical expertise on a contractbasis.    Of the thirteen, twelve strongly supported the position of contractingfor technical expertise in healthcare delivery, with in-house staff havingbroad experience in the field with the ability to review, analyze and evaluatedata provided by the technical experts.Several commenters indicated that there are a limited number of individualswith the technical skills and knowledge required, and that program implementationcould be delayed by lenders competing for these limited resources. In addition,the Mortgage Bankers Association commented that there may be some reluctanceamong these experts to go from the healthcare industry to the banking/realestate industry on a full-time basis. The Healthcare Financing Study Groupindicated that the non-FHA financiers typically rely on contract personnelfor technical input in this area.Many commenters pointed out that HUD does not have in-house technical expertiseto analyze fully insured facilities. Furthermore, the coinsurance programsallow for contract personnel in other areas requiring technical expertise(e.g., management analysis, architectual) and they could see no differencein principle here. Because certification, licensing and reimbursement practicesvary so widely among States, it is also unlikely that any one or two individualswould be familiar with all areas in which a lender may do business.The Department believes these comments have some validity. It also believes,however, that a coinsurer must have at lease one individual in its ownemploy who has a <T3>strong</T3> background in the development, management and operationof the various types of residential healthcare facilities and who can analyzeand evaluate various technical inputs such as certifications, reimbursementschedules, market analyses, operational reviews, etc. to determine projectfeasibility.Technical experts may be contracted on a retainer basis or for an individualproject, but must be familiar with certification and licensing requirements,reimbursement procedures, reasonable and customary charges and all otheraspects of healthcare delivery for the locality of the project. The finalrule reflects this policy.4. <T3>Mortgage Insurance Premium Split (andSection; 252.801)</T3>._Six commentersquestioned the validity of a change to a mortgage insurance premium splitof 70% to HUD and 30% to the coinsurer. They did not believe it to be adequateor equitable in light of the increased risk sharing ratio being imposedunder the proposed regulation. They urged the Department to maintain currentcoinsurance program requirements thereby lending consistency to, and asense of confidence in, the programs.As noted above, this final rule establishes a risk sharing ratio of 85:15,the same as that provided in the other coinsurance programs. In light ofthis change from the proposed rule, the mortgage insurance premium splitis also retained at an 80:20 ratio (which takes into account the lender'sresponsibility for the first 5 percent of the loss).5. <T3>Seventy percent loan to value ratio on refinancing</T3>._One commenterrecommended deletion of andSection; 232.903(c) of the proposed rule. Thecommenter states: ``there is no reason to maintain a 70% loan to valueon a refinance. The 85% loan to value should be kept for all situations.The 70% rule under section 223(f) was meant to be a test for three to fiveyears and then change to 85%. Keeping the 70% figure tends to encouragehigher appraisals so that the actual mortgage is closer to 85% of a morerealistic value. It would be better to mandate accurate appraisals andhave 85% of value for all transactions.''Item number 2, above, explains HUD's policy with respect to mortgage limitsto refinancings. The final rule eliminates the 70% of value test for refinancingexisting facilities under this part.6. <T3>Disposition of a Project.</T3>_Under the current coinsurance programs,when a lender disposes of a project through a competitive bid procedure,the amount which may be deducted for the claim payment computation is thesales price. Under the proposed nursing home regulation (andSection; 252.822),a deduction would be made from the claim payment consisting of the higherof the proceeds from the sale of the project <T3>or</T3> the appraised value of the project.Nine commenters took exception to this change from the current coinsuranceprograms. They argue that a competitive bid sales price is clearly themost accurate measure of the value of the property because it evidencesthe willingness of a buyer to acquire a property whereas use of an appraisalis much more ``subjective'' and likely to be out of date in a very shortperiod of time.In light of other changes made from the proposed rule in this final rule_<T3>i.e.</T3>, increased Sound Capital Resources requirements, mortgagelimitations_we believe the position of the commenters is reasonable. Asin the existing coinsurance programs, this final rule provides that theamount which may be deducted for a claim payment computation <T3>in a competitive bid situation </T3>is the sales price.7. <T3>Sound Capital Resources (andSection; 252.102)</T3>._Three commentersopposed the proposed rule's requirement that liquid assets of $1,500,000(rather than $500,000) would be needed to meet the Sound Capital Resourcesrequirement. They argue that this increase will have a negative impactin attracting highly qualified participants to the nursing home coinsuranceprogram.One commenter had no objection to the increased liquidity requirement forsound capital resources, but did find the logic stated in the Preamble's``Description of Proposed Rule'' to be faulty. ``Inasmuch as HUD permitsthe addition of loan loss reserves to stated net worth in the determinationof a coinsurer's sound capital resources, the establishment of loan lossreserves by the coinsurer does not necessarily indicate that the coinsurerbelieves that the loan risk is greater than HUD. It may reflect the coinsurer'sbusiness policy, tax considerations or other matters, particularly withthe new tax treatment of loss reserves.'' The commenter did believe, however,that coinsured nursing home lending is somewhat riskier than other coinsuranceprograms primarily because of the service business nature of eligible projectsand the regulatory oversight by agencies other than HUD.''The final rule retains the $1.5 million net worth requirement, all of whichmust be liquid. In addition, it requires that a dedicated account be established_initiallywith $500,000 of the liquidity requirement, and with additional depositsas cases are closed and based on the lender's share of annual MIP for fouryears of a project's mortgage term. Further, individual mortgage amountswill be limited by Sound Capital Resources level (toward which the dedicatedaccount will be credited) until a $3 million level is reached.Our goal regarding all financial requirements is to ensure that in theevent of a default, there are funds available to cover the lender's obligations;otherwise, the Department may be faced with being liable for the wholeloss through the GNMA mortgage-backed securities program. Only adequatelyfunded dedicated reserves can ensure this.Therefore, as mentioned above, the final rule will require that $500,000of the initial $1.5 million in liquid funds be placed in a dedicated account.Additions to the account will be funded from a deposit at the time eachcase is closed. The amount of the deposit at closing will slide from $1for each $150 of mortgage amount until the account reaches a balance of$3 million to $1 per $300 (the present 221(d)/223(f) ratio) thereafter.All funds in this dedicated account will be credited toward the lender'sSound Capital Resources requirement.Withdrawals from the dedicated account could only be made for the purposeof meeting the lender's coinsurance obligations, including claims, GNMApassthroughs and certain other expenditures (but not payment of MIP orsimilar full insurance charges), as specified by HUD in the program handbook.HUD may develop standards, based upon actuarial experience, for reducingdedicated account requirements. Such standards would be implemented bynotice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.We also concur with the concept of mortgage limitations based on SoundCapital Resources levels and include in the final rule the following scheduleproposed by the Healthcare Financing Study Group. (1) Mortgages may not exceed $10 million per case until $2.0 million inSound Capital Resources is established;(2) Mortgages may not exceed $15 million per case until $2. 5 million isattained;(3) Mortgages may not exceed $20 million per case until $3 million is attained;and(4) Limit mortgages only by prudent underwriting after $3 million in SoundCapital Resources is attained.These changes are intended to strengthen the financial ability of coinsuringlenders to meet their program responsibilities, particularly their shareof possible coinsurance losses.8. <T3>Labor Standard and Prevailing Wage Requirements. </T3>Three commentersnoted that the Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for the final determinationof a project's prevailing wage rates. They strongly urged HUD to discussat great length with DOL the nursing home program description, intent andeffect in order to ensure that DOL understands how nursing homes are intendedto facilitate the living accommodations of elderly and handicapped persons.<ITAG tagnum="21">We request the Department's consideration to utilize multifamily residentialrates rather than commercial prevailing wage rates for nursing homes andrelated facilities after negotiations with the Department of Labor. Thelower residential rate would greatly reduce the overall construction costsof a project. It would assist greatly in delivering these types of facilitiesto house the nation's increasing elderly population and, at the same time,reduce any risk to the insurance fund.</ITAG>The Department acknowledges the differences in prevailing wage rates andtheir significant impact on the economic feasibility of some projects.In those instances where it is possible to achieve a residential wage ratedetermination, this approach will be highlighted with the Department ofLabor.9. <T3>Substantial Rehabilitation of Nursing Homes_</T3>One commenter askedthat the maximum mortgage limitations relating to substantial rehabilitationin Part 252 parallel the 251 coinsurance program (andSection; 251.203(d))for refinancing of substantial rehabilitation projects. It argued thatthis revision to the regulation in determining the maximum mortgage amountwill facilitate the use of the substantial rehabilitation portion of theprogram and encourage existing projects to apply for the 232 coinsuranceprogram relieving FHA of existing nursing home projects in their portfolio.The Part 252 substantial rehabilitation mortgage limitations test is basedon the section 232 full insurance program. The terms and conditions forfull insurance and for coinsurance must remain substantially similar.10. <T3>Inclusion of the 1987 Housing Provisions_</T3>Five commenters requestedthat HUD include in the rule the provisions contained in section 410 ofthe Housing and Community Act of 1987 relating to the inclusion of publicmortgagors as eligible mortgage entities and new provisions regarding StateApproval requirements.Changes made in section 410 of the Housing and Community Development Actof 1987 are included in the final rule.11. <T3>Co-coinsurance_</T3>Two commenters noted that from the inception ofthe Housing coinsurance programs, there has been a concern with the inabilityof coinsurers to locate companies with an interest in reinsuring the lender'scoinsurance risk. They proposed that the Department consider a ``co-coinsurance''program by which an approved coinsurer could jointly participate with otherapproved coinsurers on a specific coinsured loan. Such participations wouldnot be considered ``reinsurance'' for purposes of changing the risk sharingratios. Coinsurance participation would be a function of the joint capitalizationof the participants. They argue that permitting joint coinsured loans wouldenhance program quality and reduce the likelihood of a financial defaultby coinsurers to GNMA or FHA.Co-insurance can be accomplished now through the approved sale of coinsuredservicing to another coinsurer, however the originating lender must meetall Sound Capital Resources requirements to close a loan.12. <T3>Reinsurance_</T3>One commenter noted that the reinsurance provisionsunder the regulations are generally ineffective because they do not matchthe economic incentives reflected elsewhere in the regulations. It arguedthat reasons to reinsure would be:(a) To substitute insurer reserves for cash reserves held by the lender;and(b) To increase the capital strength of the lender (the equivalent of SoundCapital Resources).The commenter went on to state that both of these purposes would benefitHUD. However, as the regulations now read, reinsurance is neither recognizedas an offset to the required reserves nor to Sound Capital Resources. Inaddition, the establishment of reinsurance has a direct and substantialimpact on the lender by <T3>increasing </T3>its loss exposure.The commenter believes it would be appropriate to consider economic incentiveswhich will encouage lenders to reinsure a portion of their risk. The alternativesare:(a) Provide a credit against the Sound Capital Resources and/or liquidassets provided that the reinsurer qualifies as to assets or claims payingcapacity in a manner similar to the definition of ``a supervised financialinstitution with assets of not less than $100,000,000''; and (b) Eliminate the reduction from HUD's portion of the loss or increasethe allocation of premium to the lender; <T3>if </T3>the reinsurer will make HUD, GNMA, and the holder of the HUDinsured mortgage, a direct beneficiary of the reinsurance.The final rule remains unchanged regarding reinsurance. The optional 25basis points remain available to the lender to purchase reinsurance shouldit so desire. Because of increasing the liquidity in Sound Capital Resources,as well as the establishment of the dedicated account, we do not feel thatadditional incentives to purchase reinsurance are necessary at this time.The final rule conforms to Parts 251 and 255 on reinsurance.13. <T3>Proposal for Interim Settlement of Insurance Benefits._</T3>Two commentersasserted that after default, but prior to receipt of insurance benefits,the coinsuring lender must continue to make payments on the GNMA or othersecurities issued to fund the coinsured loan and cover necessary expensesto maintain and preserve projects. They point out that this period maybe as long as several years and only at its conclusion is the coinsurerreimbursed for the Department's share of costs.This result, it is argued, creates a severe capital drain and jeopardizesthe coinsurer's economic survival. ``It would seem that as the FederalGovernment already guarantees the payment of the GNMA securities used tofinance the loan in the event of a lender default on such securities, andas it appears in no one's interest to drain the coinsurer's capital duringthe default period (only to reimburse it thereafter) that HUD should consideran interim settlement program. One basis for such settlement would be topay the coninsurer at the commencement of foreclosure proceedings, no lessthan quarterly, a sum which would provide the coinsurer with an estimatedportion of the insurance benefits that it will ultimately receive. Suchamounts would then be used to service the GNMA securites or otherwise beapplied to project preservation. To the extent that the Department is concernedwith an overpayment of benefits, the interim settlement can be limitedto a percentage of the debt service on the GNMA securities or other reasonablestandard. Nevertheless, any proposal that would reduce the stress on acoinsurer's capital during the default period would significantly reducethe likelihood of financial defaults by coinsurers.''In response to this concern the Department has prepared a coinsuring lenderletter that will announce an interim settlement procedure for claims ineach of the coinsurance programs.14. <T3>Three Year Requirement for Refinancing (andSection; 232.902). </T3>Onecommenter stated that the requirement that three years have elapsed fromthe date of completion of construction or substantial rehabilitation ofthe project to the date of refinancing is acceptable as a general rule,but there should be room for some exceptions.Reasons to include exceptions to the three year limit involve individualor unusual circumstances. For example, an insured facility may have beenrecently substantially rehabilitated and managed by a single owner whobecomes incapacitated or dies prior to the three year limit. In this case,the facility may be for sale but disadvantaged in the market because ofthe arbitrary prohibition on the HUD 232 insurance refinancing.Another reason to remove the three year period is the fluctuating interestrate. The three year restriction may impede a facility's ability to takeadvantage of the best and most timely opportunity to refinance and therebylower costs.The three-year rule should not prevent any project from refinancing ina declining interest rate market. The section 223(a)(7) program is availablewithout a three-year restriction.15. <T3>Integrate Board and Care and Nursing Beds. </T3>One commenter urgedHUD to allow facilities to integrate board and care beds with nursing beds.It argues that this allows couples to share rooms and receive the appropriatelevel of care. SNF and ICF beds should be allowed to be integrated forthe same reasons. The commenter notes that at least one state, New Jersey,requires new nursing homes to include board and care homes.The same commenter objects to the maximum ratio in the rule of four personsper full bathroom (andSection; 252.201(a)). It says many state regulationsdo not require ``residents to full bathroom'' ratios. In these states,some facilities have been constructed with a greater person to full bathratio. Other facilities have sink, toilet, and shower or tub facilitiesin separate locations and therefore do not have ``full baths''.The final rules does not preclude a combination of the various facilitieswithin the same project. It does, however, prohibit the integration ofboard and care with the nursing home or intermediate care facility beds.Nursing home and intermediate care beds may be integrated but must be clearlydesignated and identified.The major reason for requiring a separation in these facilities is thedifference in the services and level of care provided to and required bythe residents. Staffing and skill levels necessary to operate the facilitiescertainly vary widely between board and care and the other types. In addition,certification requirements differ among the various types of facilitiesand monitoring and inspection would be difficult, if not impossible, ifall levels of care were integrated.16. <T3>Liberalize Portfolio Coinsurance._</T3>One commenter objects to theprovision in andSection; 252.207 of the rule limiting the refinancing ofa lender's portfolio loans to no more than one fourth of the total numberof loans the lender presents for endorsement for coinsurance during any12-month period. It argues that the demand for refinancing increases asinterest rates fall. Limiting refinancing of loans to twenty five percentmay unnecessarily restrict the coinsurance available during low interesttimes.Portfolio coinsurance currently excepts cases insured by HUD under fullinsurance programs, where the lender's sole involvement is servicing andin which no equity is being removed. The Department feels that no additionalflexibility is needed at this time.17. <T3>Operating Loss Loans</T3>._Two commenters strongly urged that the ruleprovide for operating loss loans in connection with newly constructed orsubstantially rehabilitated projects.Operating loss loans are not being considered for coinsurance at this time.18. <T3>Permit Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure at Closing</T3>._One commenter notedthat andSection; 252.817(a) of the rule effectively prohibits the coinsurerfrom obtaining a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure at initial endorsement. Itstrongly suggests that this provision be modified. ``As the proposed rulewould seem to indicate, the Department is concerned with the difficultiesin operating and selling nursing home projects after foreclosure. In orderto reduce the time frame of the foreclosure period, particularly becauseof the difficulties anticipated in managing a defaulted Nursing Home occupiedby elderly and other chronically ill patients, it would be advisable toobtain deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure at closing where permitted by statelaw. At a minimum, HUD's required Regulatory Agreement should permit theinclusion of procedures by which a lender in the event of default can immediatelyobtain the facility operating license and obtain other rights necessaryto operate the project during this period. This will be an important rightin the event of default because of the unique operating features of nursinghomes.''The use of deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is now provided for in the regulations.The Department will encourage the prompt action by a coinsurer to acquireoperational control of a property in order to maintain a high standardof healthcare operations for the residents. The assignment of Lessee privilegeswill be permitted.19. <T3>Operating Deficit Fund (andSection; 252.902(b))</T3>._One commenter statedthat, in the case of the acquisition or refinancing of existing projectsunder the nursing home program, the coinsuring lender should establishthe amount of the initial operating deficit, if any, rather than this amountbeing established by the Commissioner. The commenter had no objection tothe Commissioner establishing criteria to be used by the coinsuring lenderin reaching its determination.A technical correction in the final rule provides that operating deficitcalculations will be performed by the coinsuring lender.20. <T3>Occupancy Density Requirements for Board and Care Homes (andSection;252.201(a))._</T3>In the proposed rule public comment was sought on alternativeoccupancy requirements for Board and Care Homes. Two options were listed.Due to the lack of substantive comments on this issue, the Department willcontinue to administer its current policy of providing for a maximum offour residents per bedroom and per bath, under Part 232.21. Numerous ``technical'' revisions are made in this final rule_many ofthem in response to the public comments. Among the more significant revisionsare:Section 252.203 Maximum Mortgage LimitationsThis section was reorganized to conform in structure with the other coinsuranceprograms. However, in the final rule, the mortgage amount, in connectionwith substantial rehabilitation, has been changed to conform with the additionallimits set forth in Part 232.Section 252.301 Processing and Development ResponsibilitiesThe final rule adds an additional provision making the Commissioner responsiblefor a market/submarket impact analysis of the proposed facility. Also,the responsibility for the intergovernmental review process pursuant to24 CFR Part 52 has been added to this section.Section 252.303 Required CertificatesThis section has been modified to reflect the requirements set forth insection 410 of the HCDA of 1987.Section 252.503 Mortgage and Note ProvisionsThe requirement for the mortgage to contain a covenant prohibiting theuse of the property for any purpose other than a residential care facilitywas inadvertently omitted in the proposed rule. It appears in the finalrule.Section 252.501 Mortgage Requirements_Real EstateThe proposed rule stated that if the mortgage is on real estate which isunder lease, the lease must have a term of not less than 55 years fromthe execution date of the mortgage.The final rule will extend that term to 75 years beyond the mortgage executiondate. This will conform this part to Parts 251 and 255.Section 252.703 Charges for Facilities and ServicesThe final rule has been amended to include a prohibition against the collectionof an admission fee, founder's fee, life care fee or any similar paymentby the mortgagor in exchange for accommodations or services to a currentor prospective resident.Section 252.705 Distributions and Residual ReceiptsThere are no substantive changes to this section in the final rule exceptto add ``public mortgagor'' where appropriate. However, the entire sectionhas been reorganized to more clearly describe the distributions to thevarious mortgagor types.Section 252.907 Payment of MIP by Mortgagor and LenderThis section was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. It has beenadded to the final rule based on language in andSection;255.801.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conforming Amendments to Parts 251 and 255</ITAG>In developing this new Part 252, we discovered two technical flaws in thecurrent coinsurance regulations which should be corrected in conjunctionwith the publication of this final rule. One flaw is the inadvertent omissionof the longstanding requirement (found in both full insurance and coinsuranceprograms) that the lender annually inspect the project and provide theCommissioner a report on its physical condition. (See andSection;207.260Protection of mortage security, paragraph (a), Annual inspection of propertyby mortgagee.)This requirement was originally included in the section 223(f) Coinsuranceregulations at andSection;255.216, Hazard insurance and physical condition.When the Section 221(d) Coinsurance regulations were drafted, there wasa major restructuring of the rule, the insurance requirements were foldedinto andSection;251.503, Mortgage provisions, and the annual physical inspectionrequirement fell by the wayside. Subsequently, when Part 255 was restructuredto conform to Part 251, the inspection requirement for section 223(f) coinsurancedisappeared. Similarly, when Part 252 was drafted following the order andcontent of Parts 251 and 255, the annual inspection requirement was notincluded.The final rule corrects this omission, under the heading ``Protection ofMortgage Security'', by adding a new section 806 to each of the Parts 251,252 and 255.The final rule also amends andSection;252.819, as well as the correspondingprovisions of Parts 251 and 255, in order to correct another technicalflaw concerning the computation of coinsurance benefits. Section 252.819of the proposed rule, as well as 24 CFR 251.819 and 255.819, incorporateby reference 24 CFR 207.259(e), which describes the characteristics ofdebentures issued in the settlement of insurance benefits under the insuranceprograms. Section 207.259(e)(1) and (6) states that debentures shall beissued as of the date of default and will collect interest from the dateof issue. Inadvertently, 24 CFR 251.819 and 255.819 did not exclude fromthe cross-reference the date of default provision. If debentures issuedunder the coinsurance programs were likewise issued as of the date of default,the mortgagee would receive two unintended windfalls. First, the mortgageewould receive both mortgage interest and debenture interest (``double interest'')covering the same period of time with respect to the principal amount includedin the debentures. Second, the mortgagee would earn debenture intereston the mortgage interest (``interest on interest'') included in the faceamount of the debenture. As a result, debenture settlements would havea considerably greater dollar value to the mortgagee than cash settlements.These consequences would be inconsistent with the basic principles of HUD'smultifamily mortage insurance programs. HUD does not pay double interestor interest on interest in either full insurance cash or debenture settlements.Moreover, in full insurance claims the benefits paid to the lender undera cash settlement are equivalent to the benefits paid under a debenturesettlement; it has always been HUD`s intent that this parity be maintainedin the coinsurance program. Finally, the payment of double interest andinterest on interest would violate the basic statutory principle in section244(a)(1) of the National Housing Act that the mortgagee will assume afixed percentage of the loss on the insured mortgage ``in direct proportionto the amount of the coinsurance * * *.'' The revisions included in thisfinal rule clarify the original intent that in debenture settlements, asin cash settlements, the mortgage is entitled to receive only mortage interestfor the period from the date of default until the date of settlement.To allow double interest and interest on interest would create a resultthat was never intended under the coinsurance program and that would beirrational. A court would not enforce a ``plain meaning'' interpretationof a regulation which produced an unreasonable result. <T3>See United States </T3>v. <T3>American Trucking Assn., </T3>310 U.S. 534, 543 (1940). This technicalcorrection to 24 CFR 251.819 and 255.819 will not interfere with the legitimateexpectations of coinsuring lenders on the amount of HUD's insurance claimsettlement. The purpose of the insurance is to guarantee to lenders reimbursementfor HUD's share of the loss. Computation of insurance benefits under 24CFR 251.820-251.822 and 255.820-251.823 fully compensates the lenders forHUD's share of the loss. In any event there is no basis for lenders toexpect that a debenture settlement should result in a substantially greaterpayment than a cash settlement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Requirements</ITAG>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theUndersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
