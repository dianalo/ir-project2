(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Summer heat waves are deadlier forNortherners and Midwesterners than for Southerners, where almost noone dies when the mercury soars, a researcher says.   The top six cities for weather-related deaths are St. Louis, NewYork, Philadelphia, Detroit, Kansas City, Mo., and Chicago, saidDr. Lawrence Kalkstein of the University of Delaware's Center forClimatic Research.   During an average summer, 183 people die in St. Louis because ofweather alone, Kalkstein said. In New York, it's 139 and inPhiladelphia, 118.   The cities with the lowest weather-related death rates aresouthern areas: Dallas, New Orleans and Oklahoma City.   ``In those three cities in an average summer season, almost noone dies'' from heat-related problems, Kalkstein said.   When the temperature in a city exceeds a certain threshold, suchas 92 degrees in New York, the number of people who die canincrease by up to 50 percent, Kalkstein said.   Kalkstein determined the threshold temperatures using a weatherstress index in work funded by the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration.   In a $225,000 study funded by the Environmental ProtectionAdministration, Kalkstein is looking at other aspects of weather'simpact on human health, such as pollution and the effect of worldtemperatures that are expected to continue rising into the year2060.   The EPA has given Kalkstein scenarios for determining what willhappen as temperatures go up.   Kalkstein said, however, that the future heat-related death rateis uncertain because it's unknown whether people will acclimatize,or adjust to increasingly warm weather.   ``We wonder if New Yorkers will react like they do today or likepeople in Jacksonville, (Fla.),'' Kalkstein said.   Assuming people do not adjust, if the temperature warms by 7degrees, New York would see an estimated 1,294 deaths instead ofthe current 139, said Kalkstein, who arrived at the figures bycombining weather and death-rate data. St. Louis would face 1,664deaths instead of 183.   In general, people adjust, so there is ``no real reason tobelieve they won't acclimatize in the future. But we're concernedthat conditions might get so much warmer that it might be too muchfor humans to tolerate,'' Kalkstein said.   As the Earth warms, Kalkstein said, there are other factors toconsider, such as housing.   ``St. Louis is the best example. Most inner-city people live inred brick houses with black roofs. Even if people acclimatize,those houses will be uninhabitable for humans'' because they willbe too hot, he explained.   People over age 65 were more stressed in hot weather thanothers, Kalkstein said. He determined that the elderly aregenerally more affected by hot, dry days, while younger people aremore affected by hot, humid weather.   The duration of hot weather appeared to have more effect ondeath rates than the intensity of the heat, Kalkstein said.   ``In the summer, the kind of day that killed most people was notnecessarily a day when it got very, very hot, but it got pretty hotand remained warm all day and all night,'' he said.   The research also showed that heat waves in the beginning of theseason had more impact on mortality than late-summer heat waves.   ``By the time August comes around, (people) are used to heat,''Kalkstein explained.</TEXT></DOC>
