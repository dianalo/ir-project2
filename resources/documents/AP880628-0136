Farmers who had been sizing up tractors and harvesting equipmenthave put off purchases while they wait to see if their crop will besaved by rain, said Bill Hassenfritz, an owner of Hassenfritz Inc.,a farm equipment dealer in the the southeastern Iowa town ofMediapolis.   ``The attitude of farmers was really quite high,'' he said. ``Ican't say (the drought) has completely blown that, but it has putit on hold.''   So far, Hassenfritz said, no orders have been canceled, althoughhe's heard that some dealers have lost sales to drought worries.   Duane Hawbaker, parts manager at Randamp;M Equipment Co. at Indianola,south of Des Moines, said farmers not only have held off newinvestments, but some also are putting off repairs on equipment forfall harvests.   ``It's a very critical year to have that uncertainty show up,''said Doug Patterson, market information manager for Massey FergusonInc., a manufacturer in Des Moines.   At Deere andamp; Co. in Moline, Ill., spokesman Bob Combs said themanufacturer is watching the situation closely, but it's prematureto gauge the drought's impact on the industry. ``A little bit ofrain soon could change things,'' Combs said.   Before the drought, the farm equipment industry was showingsignificant gains from a severe slump.   The farm debt crisis of the early 1980s and the ailingagricultural economy had dealt a hard blow to manufacturers of farmequipment, resulting in layoffs, retrenchments and consolidationsthroughout the industry.   But a recovery in farm fortunes in the past two years hasallowed farmers to reduce debts and make long-postponed purchasesof equipment.   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported conditions for farmequipment sales were brightening in the first quarter of 1988,extending gains made in the second half of 1987.   There were sharp gains in retail sales of farm equipment andeven indications that tight supplies may have hindered some sales.   Sales in the first quarter of farm tractors with 40 horsepoweror more jumped more than 60 percent from a year earlier, with salesmore than doubling of four-wheel drive tractors, according to thereport by Chicago Fed economist Peter Heffernan.   Patterson said that even with the gains, sales of big tractorsstill are 75 percent to 80 percent below peak levels.   Then the drought hit.   ``In the near term it will mean a significant slide backwardswith respect to farm equipment sales,'' said George Dahlman, ananalyst who follows the farm equipment industry for the Minneapolissecurities firm of Piper Jaffrey andamp; Hopwood Inc.   ``Farmers remembered they are only two years into the recoveryand not over liquid,'' he said. ``Those expenditures that don'thave to be made won't be made.''   Dahlman said he expects the cautious attitude to remain foranother six to eight months. But while the drought comes at a badtime for the industry, he said he does not believe it will pushmanufacturers into bankruptcy.   ``Farmers are keeping a stiff upper lip and we are too,'' saidRick James, a spokesman for manufacturer J I Case Co. at Racine,Wis. ``Some dealers say customers have delayed delivery on unitsthey have purchased. But this is spotty, we're not seeing iteverywhere.''   James said there could be a silver lining for manufacturers.   He said farmers who remain in good financial condition after thefarm downturn of the 1980s are survivors.   ``As they look toward next year and look to recoup their lossesfrom this year, they will put more acres under the plow and thatcould potentially create a demand for equipment,'' James said.   Spokesman Glen Christians at Massey Ferguson said, ``themanufacturer that reaps the rewards this fall will be the one whotargets those farmers who come out (of the drought) the best.''</TEXT></DOC>
