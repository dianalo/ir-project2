CNN spokesman Steve Haworth announced Tuesday the newscast willbe shown from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, possibly with CNN anchor BernardShaw. But Haworth said, ``We have no decision on talent yet.''   The program would be twice the length of the evening news on NBC,ABC and CBS.   CNN's newscasts are carried live in each time zone, meaning theprogram would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast. The new showwill begin Oct., 16, he said.   Haworth said the new program would be designed to ``gohead-to-head with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour ofnews at 6:30 p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.   ``Seventy percent of the people who watch the evening news watchthe 6:30 p.m. segment,'' Haworth said.   CNN now runs its continuous news format in the 6-6:30 time periodand shows the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30p.m. EDT.   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge CatherineCrier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchorthe new evening news program was premature.   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joinsus,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. Whenshe comes up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll startfiguring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''   CNN started in June 1980. It has sports, commentary, talk andspecialty shows, but the bulk of its 24-hour schedule is news.</TEXT></DOC>
