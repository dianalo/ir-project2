Z-248 micros, was awardedto Zenith more than a year ago.andP;  Zenith lost the contract in a bid protest,and Navy sources said the subsequent flurry of protests, interventions,motions and briefs has prevented them from naming a new contractor.andM;The Navy amended its request for proposals and called for a new round ofbest-and-final offers from the original bidders this month.andP;  The new RFPdefines commercial availability and technical merit scoring, key points inthe protests.andP;  Navy officials have said they now expect an award by April 1,1991, 20 months after the original target date.andM;&quot;The way the Navy is handling this, Z-248s are going to be doorstops by thetime Companion is awarded,&quot; said William E. Hummel, president of bidderFederal Computer Corp. of Falls Church, Va.andM;&quot;They are now saying commercially available products are those announcedbefore 1/8/91.andP;  If you think of all the new products that have come out inthe last two years that could be specced on Companion, it becomes obviousthat most of our work to date has been for nothing,&quot; Hummel added.andM;New comer Integrated Systems Group Inc. (ISG) of Vienna, Va., sparked thelatest round of filings with a protest to the General Services AdministrationBoard of Contract Appeals this month.andP;  ISG charged that the Navysubstantially changed the procurement with an amended RFP.andP;  It asked that thebidding be opened to all comers.andM;FCC and Government Technology Services Inc. of Chantilly, Va., filled briefssupporting ISG's argument but not its remedy.andP;  They asked instead that GSBCArevoke the Navy's procurement authority and cancel the entire procurement.andM;Capt.andP;  Thomas W. McQueen, head of the Navy's ADP Selection Office, said hewas disgusted at the latest round of filings.andP;  &quot;We kept it out of the courtsfor two whole weeks before they dragged it right back,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;What can they gain?andP;  Free and open competition?andP;  Another chance toparticipate?andP;  They already have that.andP;  All they do now is delay the process,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;We were just trying to get it back into the vendor's hands, but itlooks like it's still in the lawyers'.&quot;andM;McQueen said the bidders had no need to start over in preparing CompanionBAFOs.andP;  &quot;We will only evaluate changes from the original&quot; proposals, he said.andO;&quot;Everyone's proposals had gear out of production, but no one had more than 10percent, which is not exactly starting from scratch.andP;  If they choose to makea business decision and enhance their standing with more than that 10percent, that's their decision.&quot;andM;&quot;ISG?andP;  I don't know who they are or where they came from, but they're aboutthree years too late to get into the game.andP;  They're not even on the mailinglist.andP;  Of course we'll file a response to get it dismissed for the totallybaseless protest that it is,&quot; McQueen said.andM;Stephen L. Mills, ISG's vice president of marketing, said the company usuallyworks the mainframe marketplace but crosses into microcomputing when theopportunity arises.andP;  &quot;Our piece of the issue is pretty straightforward.andP;  Whenwe first looked at Companion two years ago we opted not to play because wedidn't have a good product fit, and the requirement that all vendors performan LTD [live test demonstration] before award was pretty punishing,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The federal acquisition regulations say that if the requirements change youmust either kill the procurement or open it to everybody.andP;  Moving the LTD wasa massive change.andP;  It's a different ball game, and we want in,&quot; he said.andM;Mills signed and filed the protest himself.andP;  Although not an attorney, hesaid, he has had &quot;a lot of practice&quot; in filing protests.andP;  Federal procurementexperts said Mills is known as shrewd and capable of &quot;ferreting out a realissue.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
