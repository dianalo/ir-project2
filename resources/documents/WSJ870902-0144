But such a view is a luxury not allowed those in public policy; action must sometimes precede total information.    Prof. Cohen says that there is too much uncertainty about fertility a generation ahead to justify any action. Well, he is partly correct; we do not know with precision what American fertility rates will be 20 years from now. But this is what we do know: that there will be relatively few mothers around to bear children (we know this because most of these potential mothers are already born and come from the current low-fertility cohorts); that fertility rates in America, with some notable blips, have trended downward for 200 years -- from seven children per woman in 1790 to 1.8 children per woman today; and that never have so many countries had such low fertility rates for so long.    Most demographers, for a variety of reasons, think that for the time being the rates will stay where they are or drift lower. Thus, in the two most likely of three possible scenarios, the trends I talk about in &quot;The Birth Dearth&quot; are valid and worthy of consideration regarding what, if anything, we should do about below-replacement fertility. If the third alternative should come about (higher fertility), then Prof. Cohen could say &quot;I told you so.&quot; But I will probably respond that rates turned around because people were told, by me and others, that a real problem -- personal, economic and geopolitical -- was brewing.    Prof. Cohen implies that I sound racist while trying not to sound racist. If there is to be a changing racial and ethnic composition in the United States, it will come about due to the changed racial and ethnic composition of immigrants coming to America. (Immigrants used to be 80% white Europeans; now 80% are not white Europeans.) In my book, I favor increased legal immigration.    He also doesn't seem to get the message about geopolitics. Geopolitical strength is relative, not absolute. If fertility rates remain at current levels from now to the year 2100, the population of the Western democracies will shrink by 20% while the Soviet bloc nations will go up by 33% (as the two blocs approach population parity.) That means that, relative to now, and insofar as population is an aspect of power, the Soviet bloc will be better off. If we just want to stay where we are in this equation, it will cost us.
