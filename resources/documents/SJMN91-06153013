Hook is the mother of one and a feature writer for the Columbia,S.C., State.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Then you come to the part where Dumbo's mommy gets put away for terrorizingthe little boy who makes fun of Dumbo's big ears.;    &quot;Dumbo Mommy cage?&quot; my 21/2-year-old asks every time.;    &quot;Yes, the animal keeper put Dumbo's Mommy ina cage.&quot;;    &quot;Why?&quot; he says, his little brow all wrinkled.;    Here's wheregenerations of parents offhandedly explain that Mrs. Jumbo is getting her justpunishment for being mean to that boy. Those of us in the current generation,meanwhile, can't answer the question until we analyze the scene for hiddenmessages. Just what has Dumbo been saying about animal rights?;    I used tolove &quot;Hansel and Gretel.&quot;;    The first time Christopher and I got to the partwhere Gretel kicks the witch in the oven and shuts the door, I was too stunnedto speak. I wasn't sure whether to subject my child to this kind of behavioror to that of Sleeping Beauty's Prince Charming when he k-i-l-l-s thewitch-turned-dragon or how to act when I get to the part where a littlered-suited girl's grandmother gets eaten by a wolf.;    I am equallynonplussed to see Cinderella finding nirvana in the arms of another PrinceCharming but delighted to say I've found a way around this tale. I simplyforgo the &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending and make up my own.;    &quot;They getmarried, and they hope to be happy, but they argue sometimes so everything'snot exactly perfect,&quot; I tell Christopher. Or, &quot;He rescues her, but she rescueshim, too, because he's very lonely and needs somebody to help him sort out hisfeelings.&quot; Or, &quot;They get married, but she probably gets a job, and that makesher happy, too.&quot;;    Inside children's books are women who are witches, womenwho let their hair down so some guy can climb up and stepmothers who act likedemons possessed. Little pigs put cauldrons of hot water in fireplaces forwolves to fall into. Apples and spindles (whatever those are) drip withpoison. And Bambi's mother dies inside children's books.;    These are thebooks we grew up reading. Now many of us are questioning them, abandoning themeven, in our fear they might brainwash our children.;    Indeed, a professorof education from Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., queried nursery schoolstudents and found Mother Goose in a swan song. Dr. Bette Goldstone sayschildren aren't being read the famous collection of nursery rhymes becausetheir parents don't understand words like Miss Muffet's &quot;tuffet&quot; and theydon't like Jack breaking his crown on an outing with Jill or Rock-A-Bye Baby'sthreat to send the baby in a free fall, &quot;cradle and all.&quot;;    Goldstone andothers say this is a shame.;    &quot;They're part of our common culture,&quot; said Dr.Jill Locke, outgoing chairwoman of the Caldecott Committee, which isresponsible for picking a best-illustrated children's book every year. &quot;Theseare things people mention all the time in common conversation.&quot;;    Culturalheritage or not, I've been thinking about ridding Christopher's room of thebooks that don't balance race, sex, peace, love and color schemes in thebathroom.;    But, of the 65 or 70 books Christopher owns, the ones heconsistently asks Mommy and Daddy to read are the few that house the difficultissues. They're the ones he questions. They're the ones that force us toconsider the lessons we want him to learn. Like &quot;Cinderella.&quot;;    &quot;Stepmothermean,&quot; he says every time he hears the story.;    &quot;The stepmother is mean,&quot; Isay, remembering, of course, to tell him all stepmothers aren't mean.;   &quot;Why?&quot;;    &quot;Some people are just mean. They shouldn't be mean, which remindsme if anybody is ever mean to you, you should come tell Mommy and Daddy.&quot;;   As a child, I read most of the classics, &quot;Dumbo,&quot; &quot;Cinderella&quot; &quot;Snow White,&quot;all of Grimms' fairy tales and &quot;Pinocchio&quot; with its intense message about badboys, difficult choices and wretched ramifications.;    And I wasn'tbrainwashed.;    And anyway, if I ever took those books away from Christopher,I'd have to tell him why. Or I'd have to lie. And then my nose would growlong.;    Pinocchio said so.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DEBRA-LYNN B.
