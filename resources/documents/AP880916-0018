Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater explained the surprisingswitch on the dues as based on a determination by Reagan that theUnited Nations had ``reformed its operation.''   That doesn't alter the fact, however, that one of the tenets ofthe political philosophy that nurtured Reagan and gave identity tohis pursuit of the presidency was severe skepticism of the UnitedNations.   Conservatives always have complained that the United States paida disproportionate share of the U.N. bills while serving as aconvenient target of the Soviet bloc and the so-called non-alignedcountries.   But Reagan told the State Department to ante up, and anothercorner was turned. In his twilight months in the White House onlyhis commitment to guerrillas trying to overthrow the Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua remains uncolored by the pragmatic factthat the Contras are not making much headway.   On arms control, after campaigning in 1980 against all majoraccords with the Soviet Union and putting negotiations on a backburner for months, Reagan gradually adopted a stance that evendiehard opponents grudgingly acknowledged was far friendlier toarms control than they had expected.   They still are worried he may try to unravel the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty before heading home to California,but the new 1987 accord to ban intermediate-range nuclear missilesis safely on the books.   It stands as the only U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate anentire category of nuclear weapons, and it was negotiated onReagan's watch.   Meanwhile, four summit meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev have produced a conciliatory stance in the White Housethat is in striking contrast to early Reagan rhetorical flourishesthat included castigating Moscow as an ``evil empire.''   Until November 1985, he was the first American president sinceHerbert Hoover not to have met with a Soviet leader. Now he hasheld more one-on-one superpower summits than any of them.   Ironically, Reagan has moderated his arms control policy to suchan extent that Michael Dukakis, who is a liberal Democrat,suggested this week in outlining a nuclear missile strategy agendathat his views were not that far from the president's.   The biggest difference is over Reagan's Strategic DefenseInitiative. Dukakis said he would ``stop pouring billions andbillions of dollars'' into the pursuit of a space-based defenseagainst Soviet ballistic missiles. But he said he would continue amodest research program into possible missile defenses.   The Republican candidate, Vice President George Bush, whoprojected himself in 1980 as a moderate alternative to Reagan'sdeep conservatism, is working overtime, meanwhile, to align himselfwith Reagan's foreign policy initiatives. His pitch essentially isthat he would continue along the same course if he is elected.   Having been part of the administration, Bush's job in lining upwith Reagan policies is hardly as difficult as the task confrontingDukakis.   But the Democratic candidate's agenda on weapons moved himcloser to Reagan.   Dukakis has voiced concerns about the costs of the B-1 bomberand the Midgetman missile, but he endorsed production of theTrident II submarine-launched missile and four other weapons.   More significant, perhaps, was his vow that ``We'll use forcewhen it's necessary to protect our territory, our citizens or ourvital interests; to meet our treaty commitments; and to deter or torespond to terrorist attacks.''   The words were Dukakis's but if you close your eyes and let yourmind drift back to 1980 they might just as well have been RonaldReagan's.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid has covered diplomacy for TheAssociated Press since 1973.</TEXT></DOC>
