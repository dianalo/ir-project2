 Customers now expect more value for their money than what theyobtain from proprietary networks which often have a life expectancy of threeto five years.andM;Today's purchasers evaluate networks in terms of life-cycle costs andstrategic advantages.andP;  Whereas data communication was virtually anafterthought when installing a new host computer 10 years ago, now purchasersfrequently inquire about how long a specific box might remain in a networkbefore it is likely to become a bottleneck.andM;Strategic considerations are even more evident.andP;  Communications which arebuilt on competing and incompatible technologies simply create networkingjungles and offer no strategic advantages.andP;  Many users realize thatproprietary networks typically facilitate participating users, or a corporatedivision, without necessarily benefiting the corporation.andM;Corporate information systems are now expected either to facilitate thedecision-making and management of the enterprise, or to offer new services tothe enterprise's customers.andP;  Thus &quot;enterprise networks&quot; are required togather information from a wider variety of sources (possibly includingcustomer or supplier databases); handle that information in an open,application-independent fashion; and, place it on the desktop of the rightperson quickly.andM;The networking activities of Canada's chartered banks in the past 20 yearsare a good example of an industry practicising enterprise networking topre-empt an entire market.andP;  The banks competed in the areas of marketingprograms and internal efficiencies while co-operatively building hugenational and international communications networks.andM;Banking's financial expertise is now centralized and accessed by the localbranches, which primarily serve to market an expanded variety of customerservices through human agents and automated machines.andP;  The result is that thechartered banks have profited from a revolution in purchasing patterns.andM;Woody Gundy experienceandM;Other financial institutions have established equally potent networks tocompete with the chartered banks for investors' dollars.andP;  One example is WoodGundy, investment brokers, which maintain networks of 800 devices withinToronto and another 500 devices at branches across the country.andP;  The companyrecently implemented an enterprise network when it was faced with arelocation to new headquarters plus the acquisition of Merrill Lynch(Canada); the latter will add another 500 terminals across the country.andM;Life-cycle costs and strategic advantages were paramount factors in WoodGundy's acceptance of Gandalf's proposal for a wired Ethernet-type local-areanetwork (LAN) service that could blend the expected 1,800 disparateattachments into one transparent corporate network.andM;Wood Gundy wired its new premises with quad cable before moving in.andP;  Thiscable plan allows the company to handle moves and changes without requiringskilled technicians; that will reduce costs considerably as Merrill Lynchoperations are assimilated over the coming months.andM;Life-cycle costs also are favorably impacted by the new network'scompatibility with whatever high-volume digital links are available.andP;  Forinstance, the new hedquarters will be T1-linked to the data processing centreat another Toronto location and branch offices will be linked within regionsor to head office by Datastream or Datapac, whichever is appropriate.andM;Full network controlandM;Financial savings and strategic considerations coalesce in Wood Gundy's needto assimilate its diverse equipment into one transparent, nation-widenetwork.andP;  The equipment list includes Data General and Digital minis, IBMSystem/38s, PCs and virtually every kind of data device known to modernbusiness -- yet transparency is rapidly being achieved.andP;  Network managementsoftware assures the customer of full network control with simplifiedtroubleshooting and computerized documentation capabilities.andM;A similar installation at Noranda's Technology Center (NTC) in Pointe Claire,Que., offers further examples of an enterprise network reducing life-cyclecosts and providing strategic advantages.andM;There are in excess of 200 workstations in the laboratory, but only 10 to 20percent of the staff use heavy data flows continuously.andP;  Tony Nathanson,manager, systems engineering program at Noranda, recognized that thealternative to a &quot;homogeneous&quot; Ethernt LAN would have required equalinvestment for each station sized by the most critical application.andP;  TheGandalf solution reduced the per-workstation investment by offering each usera choice between asynchronous 19.6 Kbaud LAN service and a direct 10 MbpsEthernet backbone with a bridge between the two through the GandalfStarmaster network processor.andM;Flexibility an advantageandM;Noranda has discovered many strategic advantages.andP;  A second buildingseparated by a city street from the main building is served transparently bya remote shelf linked by fibre optics to the main switch.andP;  When NTCrelinquishes the second building, it will retrieve the remote shelf andredeploy it in a new area of the expanded main building.andP;  The only investmentleft behind will be the comparatively inexpensive twisted pair cable.andM;Flexibility is a real strategic advantage as companies increasingly alterlayouts and move operations about in response to changing business plans.andM;Another advantage surfaced when the origianl NTC network mushroomed duringthe period between design and installation.andP;  The high processing demands of atechnology laboratory expanded the network from an expected 120 devices,mostly PCs, to more than 200 devices, mostly Unix workstations.andP;  Yet thegrowth was easily and cost-effectively supported by adding modules inresponse to demands for more capacity and functionality.andM;Clearly, enterprise networking is a domin of huge networks and very complextechnologies in which few vendors have the technology muscle, the marketingclout or the financial stamina to participate.andM;Current North American players are computer giants DEC, IBM and HP; ATandamp;T andNorthern Telecom in telecommunications; and, Gandalf as the only originaldata communications company to make a successful transition to higher-ordernetworking.andP;  The primary customers are companies who need quick response tomarket conditions and who rely on information systems which often containdiverse components.andP;  That describes almost any company from a small local toa large multinational.andM;An enterprise network increasingly will have to be &quot;multi-multi-multi&quot;:andM;* Multi-site, not only in terms of gathering and distributing informationsecurely to selected people at dispersed sites, but also in terms oftransparently overcoming communications barriers between competing carriersystems.andM;* Multi-transport, which refers to the network's ability to integrate wire,fibre, coax and satellite-media.andM;* Multi-vendor, as the terms &quot;connectivity&quot; and &quot;interoperability&quot; areincreasingly heard.andP;  They refer to the transparent use of informationtechnology software across both intracompany and intercompany communicationsnetworks.andM;Strategic networking players ultimately must develop architectures based onthe International Standards Organization (OSI) seven-layer model which willaccept all OSI-compatible equipent.andP;  User demand is already pushing vendorsto accept OSI guidelines, even those vendors who previously clung toproprietary solutions.andM;That demand will grow at the 1992 European trade unification approaches andas the new governmental procurement guidelines (GOSIP) take effect.andP;  The factthat more than 30 exhibitors showed multi-vendor, OSI-compatible products atthe Hanover Trade Fair last February reveals that the vendors are getting themessage.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
