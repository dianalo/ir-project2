Ryzhkov, who would losehis job in the government overhaul proposed by President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, set ambitious goals when he took the post in 1985.   One of his first and toughest tasks was to trim the bloatedbureacracy inherited from the ``era of stagnation'' under theleadership of Leonid I. Brezhnev.   Gorbachev initiated the political and economic restructuringknown as ``perestroika'' shortly after he became leader in 1985,and Ryzhkov was a key lieutenant in implementing reforms.   But the 61-year-old prime minister has not always agreed withhis boss. ``Sometimes I clashed with him on practical issues,'' hesaid in an interview last summer with the magazine Arguments andFacts.   During his five-year tenure, Ryzhkov eliminated 25 ministriesand dozens of other central officers were dismantled. In theinterview, he described efforts to pare down the entrenchedbureaucracy as ``a battle royal.''   Nevertheless, it was the same bureaucracy that he climbedthrough to reach the post considered the second most powerful inthe country.   Ryzhkov was born on Sept. 28, 1929, to a miner's family. Aftergraduating from the Urals Polytechnical Institute with a degree inengineering, he began working in 1950 at the giant Uralmashmachine-building complex in Sverdlovsk. Twenty years later hebecame its director-general.   He joined the Communist Party in 1956 and became active inpolitics with his appointment to the Supreme Soviet Commission onPlanning and Budget in 1974. In 1981, he became a full member ofthe party's Central Committee.   In 1985, six weeks after Gorbachev became general secretary,Ryzhkov was appointed a full member of the Communist PartyPolitburo. He was named chairman of the Council of Ministers inSeptember of that year.   During his first years as prime minister, Ryzhkov was largelyregarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of ahigh-profile Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts forvictims of the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia.   ``Thanks to his TV image, many thought Ryzhkov a soft andirresolute man,'' the Novosti news agency said in a 1989 profile.``That was so until the Armenian earthquake at the end of lastyear. The world then saw another man. The mask of reservation fellto reveal frankness and undisguised passionate pity.''   But his popularity proved short-lived.   Blame for the abysmal economic conditions sweeping the countrywas laid at his feet. For the past year, Supreme Soviet lawmakers,demonstrators and intellectuals have demanded the resignation ofRyzhkov and his government.   ``Almost each parliamentary session over the past year beganwith demands for the resignation of the government, and thissession hears the same demand,'' Ryzhkov told lawmakers Saturday.   ``All this prevents the normal functioning of the supremeexecutive power body,'' he said. ``The atmosphere created aroundthe government, in fact, dooms its decisions tonon-implementation.''   Ryzhkov appeared philosophical about the imminent demise of hisjob, saying he only learned of Gorbachev's proposals 20 minutesbefore they were presented to the Supreme Soviet.   ``I understood that the position of chairman of the Council ofMinisters won't exist. There will be presidential rule, apresidential Cabinet,'' he said. The job of vice president,included in the Gorbachev proposal, was not offered to him, Ryzhkovsaid.   Despite the uncertainty of his future, Ryzhkov said he supportedGorbachev's restructuring plans.   But, he said, things will be just as tough under the new setupas they were under his government.   ``It will be just as hard for them as us, because our life issuch,'' Ryzhkov said. ``We really are at a pivotal stage when theold structure is still being broken down and the new one is beingborn.''</TEXT></DOC>
