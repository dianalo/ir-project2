The ban in the nation's second largest city, which took effect atmidnight Tuesday, was driven by public outrage over street-gangwarfare waged with military arms and by the Jan. 17 slaying of fiveschoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.   The Stockton killer, Patrick Purdy, used an AKM-47 assault rifle,a semiautomatic version of the gun used around the world by Sovietbloc troops, to gun down the children. He then killed himself withanother weapon.   On Tuesday, Albert Edward Gulart Jr., 20, Purdy's half-brother,was arrested on weapons charges after his home was staked out byofficers who had questioned him following the schoolyard killings.   Police seized a semiautomatic 9mm Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol,an M-1 carbine, ammunition, artillery shells, blasting caps andother explosives from Gulart's home in Modesto, Calif., about 300miles north of Los Angeles.   Los Angeles police have said they will not actively look forowners of guns defined as illegal under the city's new law and bymidday Wednesday there had been no arrests reported as a result ofthe new misdemeanor offense.   Gun shop owners, aided by the National Rifle Association, havechallenged gun laws imposed in Los Angeles and Stockton.   Gun owners were left confused by the possibility that the lawthey might be violating could be overturned or displaced by a statelaw.   ``It puts the gun collector or owner in an awkward civic andeconomic position,'' said local gun owner Steve Levine. ``Therecould be a considerable investment involved. There has been nocompensation addressed in the law. They're just telling people youhave to get rid of them.''   Deputy City Attorney Byron Boeckman suggested owners of theillegal weapons ``not take them outside of their homes except totake them to the Los Angeles Police Department.'' He recommendedthat gun owners ask officers to keep custody of the weapons untilthe issue is decided in court.   The NRA challenge filed with the state Supreme Court contendsthat the state rather than local government has the right tolegislate gun ownership.   Boeckman said the state has failed to show a clear intent toregulate assault rifles, leaving it open for local legislation.   Even as those arguments were put forward, the Assembly PublicSafety Committee approved a ban on the sale of two dozen specifiedassault weapons, including the AK-47. Later, the Senate JudiciaryCommittee narrowly approved a broader bill.   Both bills would allow anyone who lawfully possesses assaultweapons before Oct. 1, 1989, to keep them by registering them withthe Department of Justice. Both bills went fiscal committees, thelast stop before the floors in each house.   Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the NRA, said theorganization was contacting lawmakers to lobby against thelegislation.   Gardiner said the Los Angeles ordinance probably has affected``hundreds of thousands'' of gun owners in the city.   The Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 Tuesday not toban semiautomatic weapons within the county's unincorporated areas.However, the board voted to support a statewide ban of such weapons.   The ban in the city of Los Angeles, approved by the City Councilin February, makes it a misdemeanor to own a semiautomatic gun.Sales of the guns within city limits became illegal immediatelyafter passage of the ordinance.   The measure bans semiautomatic rifles and carbines with acapacity of 20 rounds or more and short-barreled shotguns that holdsix rounds or more. Banned by name are the Uzi, AK-47, AKM-47,AR-15, Ingram MAC-10 and MAC-11.</TEXT></DOC>
