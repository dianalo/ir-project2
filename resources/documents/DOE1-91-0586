Two-dimensionalseismic reflection data re interpreted as follows: First, seismic dataare acquired by using an appropriate parameter, and are processed toproduce a time-section. A particular horizon to be traced on the time-sectionis extracted in consideration of geophysical logging of data on existingwells geology, fossils, and so on. The time values with respect to thehorizon on all the time-sections within the survey area are read, andare plotted to produce a contour map. In some case, the differences betweenthe time values of the horizons are read to form an isochronal map. (15figs)</TEXT></DOC>
