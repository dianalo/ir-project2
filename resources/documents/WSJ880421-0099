The order allows for a 60-day cooling-off period, during which both sides can continue negotiating and consider nonbinding recommendations that will be issued by the three-person board after 30 days.    Creation of such a board, which is permitted under the federal Railway Labor Act, is not an unusual action when interstate commerce is involved. The Chicago andamp; North Western hauls freight on 6,500 miles of track between Chicago and Omaha, Neb., and between Duluth, Minn., and Kansas City, Mo. It also serves commuters to Chicago.    Moreover, there was a possibility that the dispute between the railroad and the United Transportation Union could have turned into a national issue, because the union is allowed to extend picketing to other railroads.    CNW wants to cut the size of crews on its freight trains to two from four or five: It claims that technological advances have made the jobs of two brakemen obsolete. By eliminating the jobs of 1,150 brakemen, the company said it can save $53 million annually.    The dispute has far-reaching implications for the railroad industry, which seeks to eliminate thousands of jobs to lower its costs and become more competitive with the trucking industry. </TEXT></DOC>
