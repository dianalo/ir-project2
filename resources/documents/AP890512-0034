The decision puts the United States in line with all other majorWestern economies in supporting such an initiative.   And the reversal occurs the same week a government scientisttestified the White House made him alter his testimony on the``greenhouse effect'' to give the impression not everyone agreed onthe severity of the problem.   The change of course was revealed in a cable dispatched Thursdaynight to U.S. delegates at an environmental conference in Genevasponsored by the United Nations.   Declaring it was essential for the United States to exercise aleadership role, the cable said, ``We should seek to develop fullinternational consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formaltreaty-negotiating process.''   It proposed that U.S. delegates seek agreement for a ``globalwarming workshop'' hosted this fall by the United States.   The cable, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,was signed by White House chief of staff John Sununu, who only lastweek earlier had rejected efforts to put the United States in thelead in establishing an international convention on global warming.   The convention idea had been supported by Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III and Environmental Protection AgencyAdministrator William K. Reilly.   However, Sununu had argued that a convention was premature andthat more analysis was needed of economic and other effects of thepotentially dramatic actions needed against global warming,officials said.   Scientists believe that global temperatures could rise by 4degrees or as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of thenext century because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and othermanmade gases in the atmosphere will trap and retain heat from thesun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.   Such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and cause sealevels to rise, cause severe droughts and storms and severelydisrupt the earth's biological systems.   Scientists at a Senate hearing on Monday testified that theproblem might be worse than their own computer programs can predict.   The White House had ordered one of the scientists, James E.Hansen, director of National Aeronautics and Space Administration'sGoddard Institute for Space Studies, to change his testimony toavoid the impression ``that there is unanimity within thegovernment on this issue.''   The hearing had put a sharp focus on the fact that the UnitedStates was out of step with its allies on global warming.   In his cable, Sununu said, ``We consider the reported emergingagreement on an advanced preparatory program to address globalclimate response issues comprehensively to be extremely positive.   ``To further this process, please make every effort to obtainagreement on a global warming workshop this fall, hosted by theUnited States,'' Sununu said.   He said such a meeting ``should be designed to identify thescientific, legal, technical and economic issues critical tofurther progress on beginning negotiations on an internationalconvention on global climate change.''   While seeking consensus on steps for a treaty-negotiatingprocess, Sununu cautioned that ``because the size of the problem isso large, improper or ill-advised actions could have enormousunintended environmental, economic and social consequences.''   Moreover, he said that the interests of developing nations mustbe taken into account.   Sununu said the proposed workshop ``should be structured to helpidentify the elements that should be included in a frameworkconvention on global climate, as well as identifying key domesticand economic policies of all countries that must be included in anycomprehensive process.''</TEXT></DOC>
