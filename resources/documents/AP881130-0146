The Patent Office issued a ``notice of allowability'' last week,signaling it will award the patent within a few months, said John T.Preston, director of MIT's technology licensing office.   Preston said MIT has licensed exclusive rights to the patent to acompany founded last year by four of the institute's facultymembers. MIT officials refused to disclose the terms of thelicensing agreement with the company, American Superconductor Corp.of Cambridge.   Ever since two researchers at an International Business MachinesInc. laboratory in Switzerland discovered ceramic superconductors inJanuary 1986, scientists around the world have been racing todevelop and apply the new materials. The IBM researchers, GeorgBednorz and Alexander Mueller, won the 1987 Nobel Prize in physicsfor their discovery.   The advantage of ceramics is that they attain superconductivity,the ability to conduct electricity with virtually no resistance orenergy loss, when cooled with liquid nitrogen to about 300 degreesbelow zero Fahrenheit.   Previous superconductors had operated at no higher than 418degrees Fahrenheit, requiring cooling in liquid helium, which ismore expensive and difficult to handle than liquid nitrogen.   Eventually, scientists hope to develop superconductors that willwork at room temperature, which could revolutionize the computer,transportation and power transmission industries.   A major stumbling block is that the materials developed so farare brittle and tend to break when wrapped into coils or pressedinto sheets.   MIT's process combines the ceramic superconductors with a noblemetal, such as silver, gold, platinum or palladium, forming acomposite that is relatively flexible. In addition, MIT officialssaid, the composite is more resistant to oxidation and more easilyconnected to sources of electricity than previous materials.   The process was developed by MIT professors Gregory J. Yurek andJohn B. Vander Sande, two of the founders of American SuperconductorCorp. Yurek said in an interview that the company plans to enterjoint ventures with corporate partners in a wide range of industriesto explore commercial uses as soon as possible.   While the earliest practical applications are probably five yearsaway, Yurek said, ``there's no doubt these materials are going tohave a very large impact on society.''   He predicted that the first uses would be in computer shielding,small motors and satellite sensing devices, but that laterapplications would be more diverse.   ``We're talking about powerful desktop computers, medicalimaging, geological exploration, power transmission,transportation,'' he said. ``Even the popular idea of levitatingtrains is not unrealistic _ it will in fact happen.''</TEXT></DOC>
