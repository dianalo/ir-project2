Background</ITAG>These proposed regulations would implement the Program Fraud Civil RemediesAct (the Act), which was enacted on October 21, 1986 as sections 6103-6104of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-509, 100 Stat.1874), and codified at 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812. The Act establishes an administrativeremedy against anyone who makes a false claim or written statement to anyof certain Federal agencies, including the Department of Commerce (theDepartment). In brief, any person who submits a claim or written statementto an affected agency knowing or with reason to know that it is false,fictitious, or fraudulent, is liable for a penalty of up to $5,000 perclaim or statement and, in addition, with respect to claims, for an assessmentof up to double the amount falsely claimed.The Act requires each affected Federal agency to promulgate rules and regulationsnecessary to implement the provisions of the Act. 31 U.S.C. 3809. The SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee stated in its report on the Act that it``expects that the regulations would be substantially uniform throughoutgovernment.'' S. Rep. No. 99-212, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1985). In keepingwith that expression, in November, 1986 the President's Council on Integrityand Efficiency (PCIE) requested the Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) to form a task force to develop model regulations for implementationof the Act by all affected Federal agencies. HHS was asked to lead thetask force because it has since 1983 been administering a statute similarto the Act, the Civil Monetary Penalty Law, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a. (The CivilMonetary Penalty Law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to impose penaltiesand assessments against those who submit false claims to the Medicare,Medicaid, or the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Programs.) The taskforce completed a model set of regulations on March 6, 1987, and the PCIErecommended that all affected Federal agencies adopt them.The Department here proposes to adopt the final model regulations recommendedby the PCIE, incorporating, where appropriate, definitions and proceduresspecific to the Department's organization.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Description of the Statutory Scheme</ITAG>The Act provides for administrative adjudication of cases where a personmakes a claim or written statement to the Department that the person knows,or has reason to know, is false, fictitious, or fraudulent. Liability attachesunder the Act for any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for property,services, or money and for any written statement that is false, fictitious,or fraudulent with respect to any claim, contract, bid, proposal for contract,grant, loan or benefit.If a person making such a claim or statement to the Department does sowith actual knowledge or deliberate ignorance of its falsity, or acts withreckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the claim or statement,he or she can be held liable for a penalty of up to $5,000 per claim orstatement. In addition, with respect to claims, the person may be subjectto an assessment of up to double the amount falsely claimed.Role of Major Actors in Bringing CasesThe Act prescribes roles for four major actors within the Department inbringing cases under the Act: the investigating official, the reviewingofficial, the presiding official, and the authority head.The <T3>investigating official</T3> is vested with the authority to investigateall allegations of liability under the Act, including the power to subpoenadocuments and other information. If the investigating official concludesthat an action under the Act is warranted, he or she submits a report ofthe investigation to the reviewing official.The <T3>reviewing official</T3> must be someone with the Department independentof the investigating official. The reviewing official reviews the investigativereport to determine whether there is adequate evidence to believe thatthe person named in the report is liable under the Act. If so, the reviewingofficial sends to the Department of Justice a written notice of intentto issue a complaint. The Act then gives the Attorney General, or a designatedAssistant Attorney General, 90 days to approve or disapprove the issuanceof a complaint.If the appropriate Justice Department official approves a case, the reviewingofficial may serve a complaint on the respondent. The respondent may requesta hearing by filing an answer within 30 days of receiving the complaint.If the respondent does so, the reviewing official sends the complaint andanswer to a presiding officer.The <T3>presiding official</T3> serves a notice of hearing upon the respondent,supervises discovery, rules on motions, conducts the hearing, and issuesan initial decision. The initial decision will contain findings of fact,conclusions of law, and the amount of any penalties and assessments imposed.Any respondent who is determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessmentin an initial decision, may appeal that decision to the authority head.The <T3>authority head</T3> may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, remand,or settle any penalty or assessment. Should the authority head determinethat the respondent is liable for a penalty or assessment, the respondentmay obtain judicial review of such determination in an appropriate UnitedStates District Court.These proposed regulations name as the investigating official the InspectorGeneral of the Department, or a designee within the Office of InspectorGeneral (OIG) compensated at or above the basic rate of pay for grade GS-16under the General Schedule. The General Counsel or a designee within theOffice of General Counsel, also compensated at or above that rate, willact as the reviewing official. Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) will bepresiding officials, and the Secretary of the Department, or designee,will function as the authority head.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Major Issues</ITAG>1. DefinitionsMost of the proposed definitions set forth in 15 CFR 25.2 come directlyfrom the Act.2. Basic for Civil Penalties and AssessmentsFor the most part, proposed language contained in 15 CFR 25.3 comes directlyfrom the Act or the legislative history. However, the proposed regulationprovides that liability for assessments is joint and several among allrespondents; whereas, each respondent may be held liable separately fora penalty of up to $5,000 per claim or statement.3. InvestigationThe proposed regulations at 15 CFR 25.3 provide that the investigatingofficial must submit a report to the reviewing official only where he orshe concludes that action under the Act may be warranted. This sectionalso would prescribe basic procedures for the investigating official tofollow in issuing investigatory subpoenas under the Act for documents orother information. In addition, this section would make it clear that theAct does not prevent the investigating official from exercising the subpoenapowers that he or she may have under other authorities or from pursuingother remedies.4. Review by Reviewing Official Section 3809 of Title 31 requires the reviewing official to determine thatthere is a reasonable prospect of collecting the amount of penalties andassessments for which a person may be liable. The proposed regulationsat 15 CFR 25.5 would not interpret this to require the reviewing officialto determine that a respondent could pay the statutory maximum, but ratherthat the respondent could pay an ``appropriate amount.'' 5. Prerequisites for Issuing a Complaint Most of the proposed language contained in 15 CFR 25.6 is derived directlyfrom the Act. Under 31 U.S.C. 3803(c)(1), the remedies provided in theAct do not apply with respect to any claim if the amount of money (or valueof property or services) falsely demanded or requested in such claim orin a group of related claims submitted at the same time exceeds $150,000.This section interprets the term ``related group of claims submitted atthe same time'' narrowly to prevent attempts to evade liability under theAct. The proposed regulation also would make it clear that the reviewing officialmay join in a single complaint claims that are unrelated or that were notsubmitted at the same time, even if the total amount of money (or valueof property or services) falsely claimed exceeds $150,000. 6. Issuance of Complaints The proposed regulations would specify what must be included in a complaint(15 CFR 25.7) and an answer by which a respondent requests a hearing (15CFR 25.9). 15 CFR 25.8 would specify the means by which service of thecomplaint is made. 7. Default Upon Failure To File an Answer Regulations at 15 CFR 25.10 would require the ALJ (after another noticeto the respondent) to impose penalties and assessments at the statutorymaximum whenever the facts alleged in the complaint establish liabilityunder the Act and the respondent fails to file a timely answer. An initialdecision of the ALJ would become the final decision of the Department andwould not be subject to further challenge unless the respondent could demonstratethat extraordinary circumstances prevented the filing of a timely answer.8. Hearings The provisions at 15 CFR 25.14 through 25.16 are designed to ensure thefairness of a hearing by (a) providing for the separation of functionsamong those within the agency investigating, litigating, and deciding thesecases, (b) prohibiting ex parte contacts with the ALJ on any matters inissue, and (c) providing a mechanism for the disqualification of eithera reviewing official or an ALJ. 9. Rights of Parties; Authorities of the ALJ The provisions at 15 CFR 25.17 and 25.18 would list the rights of the partiesand the authorities of the ALJ not specifically provided in other sectionsof the regulations. 10. Prehearing Conferences The ALJ may order a prehearing conference at his or her discretion, butmust order at least one on the request of either party. Prehearing conferencesmay be held over the telephone at the ALJ's discretion. (15 CFR 25.19).11. Disclosure of Documents The Act requires the disclosure of certain types of materials to the respondent.31 U.S.C. 3803(e) (1) and (2). Generally speaking, these materials consistof any relevant and material documents and other materials that relateto the allegations in the complaint and upon which the findings and conclusionsof the investigating official under 15 CFR 25.4(b) are based, unless suchmaterials are subject to a privilege under Federal law. In addition, therespondent may also obtain a copy of all exculpatory information in thepossession of the reviewing official or investigating official relatingto the allegations in the complaint. (15 CFR 25.20). 12. Discovery Congress has provided for limited discovery in these proceedings. The Actprovides only for such discovery as the ALJ determines is ``necessary forthe expeditious, fair, and reasonable consideration of the issues * * *''31 U.S.C. 3803(g)(3)(B)(ii). In addition, the Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">In the ordinary case, the committee anticipates that the timely exchangeof proposed exhibits, witness lists and witness statements will constitutesufficient discovery. It is clearly the committee's hope that this alternativeadministrative mechanism will not become entangled in the unchecked ``discoverywars'' that render many court cases excessively costly and time-consuming.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">S. Rep. No. 99-212, <T3>supra</T3>, at 15.</ITAG>In order to ensure that discovery is reasonably controlled, the proposedregulation (15 CFR 25.21) provides that all discovery must be approvedby the ALJ, unless the parties agree otherwise. The burden of proof withrespect to a discovery request is on the proponent of that request. 13. Exchange of Witness Lists, Statements, and Exhibits Proposed regulations at 15 CFR 25.22 would provide for the exchange ofcertain documents before the hearing, including witness lists, copies ofprior statements of witnesses, and copies of hearing exhibits. The ALJwould be able to exclude witnesses and documents in instances where a partydid not receive such documents before the hearing. In addition, any documentsso exchanged would be deemed authentic for purposes of admissibility atthe hearing unless a party objected before the hearing. 14. Subpeonas 15 CFR 25.23 would prescribe procedures for the ALJ to issue, and for partiesand prospective witnesses to contest, subpoenas to appear at the hearing,as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3804(b). 15 CFR 25.24 would permit parties andprospective witnesses to seek protective orders to restrict discovery orto limit the disclosure of information at the hearing. 15. Sanctions The proposed regulations at 15 CFR 25.29 Would expressly recognize an ALJ'sauthority to sanction parties and their representatives for failing tocomply with regulations or orders of the ALJ. These sanction provisionsare modeled on those of the Merit Systems Protection Board at 5 CFR 1201.43.16. The Hearing and Burden of Proof15 CFR 25.30 would require that the Department has the burden of proofon the issues of liability and the existence of any factors that mightaggravate or increase the amount of penalties and assessments that maybe imposed. Conversely, the respondent has the burden of proof on any affirmativedefenses and any factors that might mitigate or reduce the amount of penaltiesand assessments.17. Determining the Amount of Penalties and AssessmentsThe Act authorizes the imposition of penalties ranging up to $5,000 foreach false claim or statement, and in addition, with respect to claims,an assessment ranging up to twice the amount falsely claimed. However,the Act is silent on how the appropriate amount of penalties or assessmentsshould be determined. The proposed regulation at 15 CFR 25.31 would provideguidance to the ALJ and the Secretary in exercising this discretion. Theproposed regulation notes that because of the intangible costs of fraud,the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others,a significant penalty and double damages ordinarily should be imposed.It then lists factors that should be considered, but notes that the listis not exhaustive. The ALJ and Secretary remain free to consider otherfactors that may aggravate or mitigate the amount of penalties and assessmentsas such factors are presented in particular cases.18. WitnessesUnder 15 CFR 25.33, the ALJ would allow testimony to be admitted in theform of a written statement or deposition so long as the opposing partieshave a sufficient opportunity to subpoena the person whose statement isbeing offered.Cross-examination may, at the discretion of the ALJ, exceed the scope ofdirect examination. The provisions in paragraphs (c) and (e) are derivedfrom Rule 611 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.19. EvidenceParagraphs (a) through (d) of 15 CFR 25.34 were included to comply withthe recommendations of the Administrative Conference of the United Statesin Recommendation 86-2, 1 CFR 305.86-2, 51 FR 25,641 (July 16, 1986). TheFederal Rules of Evidence are not, with some exceptions, generally bindingon the ALJ. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal Rules of Evidence toexclude unreliable evidence.20. Post-Hearing BriefsIt is within the ALJ's discretion to order post-hearing briefs, althoughparties are entitled to file one if they desire. (15 CFR 25.36).21. Initial DecisionThe proposed regulation at 15 CFR 25.37 would provide that within 90 daysof the filing of final post-hearing briefs, the ALJ shall serve on theparties an initial decision making specific findings of fact and conclusionsof law on whether the claims or statements alleged in the complaint violatethe Act and the appropriate amount of penalties and assessments consideringany aggravating or mitigating factors in the case. The initial decisionwould become final within 30 days unless stayed by the filing of an appealor a motion for reconsideration.22. Reconsideration of Initial Decision15 CFR 25.38 would permit any party to file with the ALJ a motion to theALJ for reconsideration of the initial decision, allowing the primary decision-makeran opportunity to correct any errors in the initial decision.23. Appeal to Authority HeadThe proposed regulations at 15 CFR 25.39 would prescribe procedures fora respondent who has been found liable for penalties and assessments inan initial decision to appeal that decision to the authority head, as guaranteedby 31 U.S.C. 3803(i)(2). The rule would provide that there is no appealof an ALJ's interlocutory orders.24. MiscellaneousThe proposed regulations 15 CFR 25.40 through 25.46 would largely reiteratestatutory provisions, except andSection; 25.41, which would provide thatthere will be no administrative stay of the authority head's final decision.25. LimitationsThe Act provides that the ALJ must serve a notice of hearing within sixyears of the date the claim or statement is made. The proposed regulation(15 CFR 25.47) would provide that service of a notice of intent to issuean initial decision in the event of default would be deemed to meet thisstatutory requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84"><T4>IV. Rulemaking Requirements  </T4></ITAG><T3>Executive Order 12291  </T3>Executive Order 12291 requires the Department to prepare and publish aninitial regulatory impact analysis for any proposed major rule. A majorrule is defined as any regulation that is likely to: (1) Have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies,or geographic regions; or (3) result in significant adverse effects oncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on theability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.  We have determined that these proposed regulations do not meet the criteriafor a major rule as defined by section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291. Ingeneral, the proposed rule would establish procedures governing the scopeand conduct of administrative adjudications to impose civil penalties andassessments upon persons who submit false claims or statements to the Department.As such, this proposed rule would have no direct effect on the economyor on Federal or State expenditures. Consequently, we have concluded thatan initial regulatory impact analysis is not required.  <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  </T3>Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354,5 U.S.C. 604(a)), we prepare and publish an initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis for proposed regulations unless the General Counsel certifiesthat the regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small business entities. The analysis is intended to explainwhat effect the regulatory action by the agency would have on small businessesand other small entities and to develop lower cost or burden alternatives.As indicated above, these proposed regulations would not have a significanteconomic impact. While some of the penalties and assessments the Departmentcould impose as a result of these regulations might have an impact on smallentities, we do not anticipate that a substantial number of these smallentities would be significantly affected by this rule-making. Therefore,the General Counsel certifies to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SmallBusiness Administration, that this proposed regulation would not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act  </T3>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewand approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirements contained in bothproposed and final rules. It has been determined that this proposed rule-makingdoes not contain specific information collection requirements and wouldnot increase the Federal paperwork burden on the public and private sector. <T3>Response to Comments  </T3>Because of the large number of comments we receive on proposed regulations,we cannot acknowledge or respond to these comments individually. However,in preparing the final rule, we shall consider all comments and shall respondto significant points in the preamble to that document.  <ITAG tagnum="84"><T4>List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 25  </T4></ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fraud, Investigations, Organizationsand functions (Government agencies) and Penalties.For the reasons stated in the preamble, it is proposed that Title 15 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations, Subtitle A, be amended by adding a newPart 25, to read as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 25_PROGRAM FRAUD CIVIL REMEDIES  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.1 Basis and purpose.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.2 Definitions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.3 Basis for civil penalties and assessments.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.4 Investigation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.5 Review by reviewing official.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.6 Prerequisites for issuing a complaint.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.7 Complaint.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.8 Service of complaint.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.9 Answer.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.10 Default upon failure to file an answer.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.11 Referral of complaint and answer to the ALJ.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.12 Notice of hearing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.13 Parties to the hearing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.14 Separation of functions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.15 Ex parte contacts.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.16 Disqualification of reviewing official or ALJ.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.17 Rights of parties.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.18 Authority of the ALJ.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.19 Prehearing conferences.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.20 Disclosure of documents.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.21 Discovery.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.22 Exchange of witness lists, statements, and exhibits.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.23 Subpoena for attendance at hearing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.24 Protective order.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.25 Fees.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.26 Form, filing and service of papers.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.27 Computation of time.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.28 Motions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.29 Sanctions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.30 The hearing and burden of proof.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.31 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.32 Location of hearing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.33 Witnesses.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.34 Evidence.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.35 The record.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.36 Post-hearing briefs.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.37 Initial decision.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.38 Reconsideration of initial decision.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.39 Appeal to authority head.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.40 Stays ordered by the Department of Justice.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.41 Stay pending appeal.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.42 Judicial review.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.43 Collection of civil penalties and assessments.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.44 Right to administrative offset.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.45 Deposit in Treasury of United States.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.46 Compromise or settlement.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">25.47 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Secs. 6101-6104, Pub.
