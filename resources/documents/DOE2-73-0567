This very heavy system is characterizedby a strong Coulomb interaction. Concerning the elastic scattering, thedata at 8.1 MeV/nucleon have shown that the elastic scattering angulardistribution is strongly altered by the strong Coulomb excitation ofthe first excited states in /sup 86/Kr and /sup 208/Pb, and that a coupledchannel analysis is necessary to get the correct ion-ion potential. Thepresent data allow to study how important the coupled channel effectsare in the determination of the ion-ion potential at high incident energy.At low incident energy, no peak corresponding to the excitation of giantresonances was observed. Actually, up to now, the study of giant resonanceswith heavy-ions in the energy range of a few tens of MeV/nucleon wasperformed only with relatively ''light'' projectiles. In such experimentsthe spectra show a selectivity similar to that observed with light-ionprobes: they are dominated by the excitation of the isoscalar giant quadrupoleand monopole resonances. Our data correspond to a much stronger Coulombinteraction and it is therefore expected that both isoscalar and isovectormodes will be excited.</TEXT></DOC>
