(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man was charged Friday with threateningtalk show host Johnny Carson, both through the mail and in personat NBC-TV studios.   Ken Orville Gause, 36, of Milwaukee, was charged with makingterrorist threats and sending threatening letters, both feloniesthat could result in a maximum seven years in prison.   Municipal Court arraignment was planned later in the day.   Gause was armed with a weapon _ a weighted sock _ when he wasarrested in the NBC lobby Wednesday afternoon, about two hoursprior to the taping of ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''Authorities said he never got close to Carson.   Carson was relieved to hear police captured Gause, police Sgt.Don Goldberg said. Authorities said Gause had Carson's Malibuaddress in his possession.   ``This situation has been going on for two years and, coming onthe heels of Rebecca Schaeffer and Kelly Lange, we viewed this as aserious threat to Mr. Carson,'' the sergeant said.   Earlier this week, jurors convicted a man who threatened to killKNBC-TV news anchor Kelly Lange at the same NBC studio, and ateen-ager charged with killing ``My Sister Sam'' actress RebeccaSchaeffer was ordered to stand trial.   Telephone calls placed to Carson's agent, Ed Hookstratten,seeking additional comment weren't returned.   Gause has been investigated for two years for letter and taperecorded threats allegedly made against Carson and otherunidentified celebrities.   ``He appears to have some emotional problems,'' Goldberg said.   Gause apparently rode a Greyhound bus from Milwaukee to LosAngeles, then took a taxi ride to Burbank, detectives said. He wascarrying a ``slug,'' a sock weighted with ``a heavy granularsubstance,'' Goldberg said.</TEXT></DOC>
