Humanitarian aid for the U.S.-backed rebels, which had beenprovided by the Agency for International Development, has been madethe responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees.   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., andCass Ballenger, R-N.C., said the recent effort has been a failureand that many of the rebels now face starvation. The leftistSandinista government which they had been fighting was replaced inelections this year by a U.S.-backed political coalition.   ``We put guns in their hands, but now we can't put food in theirmouths,'' Reid told a news conference.   The three lawmakers called for an investigation by the GeneralAccounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, into whyadequate aid is not being provided.   A State Department official, speaking only on condition ofanonymity, said the U.S. government believes that the rebels arebeing adequately cared for and denied that the United States hadbroken faith with the Contras.   An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 rebels and family members remainin the jungle camps, the lawmakers said, many of them with warinjuries. Infant mortality is high, they said.   A supplemental money bill passed earlier this year included $35million for continued humanitarian aid to the rebels as well as forrepatriation of the fighters. The lawmakers alleged that people arebeing starved in the camps to force them back into Nicaragua, butonly about 1,000 a month are being moved, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
