The National Academy of Sciences last August recommended that smoking be banned on domestic flights, saying that a ban would reduce possible health hazards caused by cabin smoke, ease passenger and crew discomfort, and eliminate the possibility of fires caused by cigarettes.    But the department, in a report to Congress, said it wants to further study the possible health hazards posed by cabin smoke. In addition, it said it wants to explore the cost and effectiveness of modifications to aircraft ventilation systems to reduce smoke.    The department's report won't be the last word on the issue. Rep. Norman Mineta (D., Calif.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, plans to hold hearings on the matter later this year. He has expressed some &quot;sympathy&quot; toward the proposed ban, aides said, although he hasn't endorsed it.    However, legislation banning smoking likely would face rough sledding in the Senate, where Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and aviation subcommittee Chairman Wendell Ford (D., Ky.) represent states with strong tobacco interests. </TEXT></DOC>
