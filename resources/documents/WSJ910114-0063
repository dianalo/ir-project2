The results of the survey of midsized insurers, releasedFriday by the Mortgage Bankers Association, offer a ray ofhope for the many developers and their lending banks that arein dire need of long-term financing.</LP><TEXT>   Many of the bank construction loans that fueled thebuilding boom of the 1980s are coming due at a time whencommercial real estate values in many areas are collapsing.Developers have traditionally turned to life insurers forlong-term financing, or &quot;take-outs.&quot;   More than half of the 36 midsized insurers surveyed saidthat they plan to lend more in 1991 than in 1990; 31%anticipated lending less. Only one respondent reported thatall lending would cease.   Midsized life insurers, defined as those who limit singleloans to about $12 million, hold roughly 35% of all permanentcommercial real estate loans held by the life insuranceindustry. The combined mortgage portfolio of the respondents,whose names were not disclosed, is $53 billion, the surveysaid.   Midsized insurers represent &quot;the bread and butter to a lotof developers out there,&quot; said Margaret Hathaway, MBA'sdirector of commercial real estate financing.   One reason that midsized companies do not seem as gun-shyas larger insurers is that fewer of their loans have gonebad. The responding insurers reported an average delinquencyrate of 1.91% on their real estate loans, compared with 3.36%for the life insurance industry as a whole.   MBA president James Nelson speculated that midsizedinsurers suffered smaller losses because they didn't financemany of the large office building deals that have gone sour.   Nevertheless, 25% of the midsized insurers reported thattheir 1990 delinquency rates were &quot;significantly higher&quot; thanin 1989, the survey found. As a result, insurers aretightening their underwriting requirements, appraisingbuildings more conservatively and using lower loan-to-valueratios.   Because of these tighter standards, developers are findingit difficult to borrow enough from insurers to cover theirintitial construction loans.   &quot;We're seeing a lot of that,&quot; says Richard Warner,investment vice president of Atlanta-based Confederation LifeInsurance Co., the U.S. arm of a Canadian insurer. Developersare closing the gap with second bank mortgages or with cashfrom other sources, he said.   The availability of long-term financing from insurers isunlikely to ease the extreme credit crunch for developers ofnew real estate. Banks, which fund construction, haveseverely restricted all new real estate lending.</TEXT></DOC>
