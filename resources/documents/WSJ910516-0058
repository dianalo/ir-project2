Closely held FMR Corp. said net income for 1990 fell 40%to $31.9 million from $53.2 million. A spokesman said thelower earnings reflect increased investments in computersystems, facilities, and emerging businesses such as a newinvestment-advice magazine, a fiber optic communicationscompany in Boston's financial district and a mobile radiocommunications firm.</LP><TEXT>   But Sy Jacobs, financial services analyst for MabonSecurities, said Fidelity is locked in a market-share warwith publicly held Dreyfus Corp. that has hurt both firms'profits. &quot;It's been a trend that when you introduce a newproduct, you hold down the management fees,&quot; he said. &quot;Shortterm, the more money that comes in the door, the more moneyyou lose.&quot;   Fidelity has been marketing heavily its Spartan funds,which include a money market fund with a management fee equalto 37 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, vs.50 or 60 basis points on other Fidelity money market funds.Spartan funds hold down costs by requiring large investmentsand limited transactions. Laurence Dwyer, a public relationsspecialist at Fidelity, said, &quot;The lower fees and subsidizedexpenses on some Spartan funds have had a minor impact on ourprofits.&quot; He said the Spartan money market fund wasprofitable last year.   Dean Eberling, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers,said, &quot;the long-term growth implied by this strategy ispretty good, but the cost near term is pretty heavy.&quot; Headded, &quot;because they're not a public company, what do theycare?&quot;   FMR's revenue for 1990 rose 17% to $1.27 billion from$1.08 billion. Assets under management rose 9.1% to $118.8billion at the end of 1990 from $108.9 billion a yearearlier. A spokesman said that because of the stock marketrun-up during the first quarter, assets under managementcurrently total about $134 billion.   FMR is about half-owned by Edward Johnson III, itschairman and chief executive officer, with the rest of thestock held by Fidelity employees who can sell it only to thecompany. As such, FMR isn't required to release financialresults.   Last year saw a slowdown in many areas of Fidelity'sperformance compared with the last half of the 1980s.Fidelity's assets under management had a compound annualgrowth rate of 16.2% for the five-year period, well above the9.1% rate for only last year. Mutual fund accounts fell 2.2%in 1990 to 4.4 million. Brokerage accounts fell 10% to 1.8million. However, the number of both mutual fund transactionsand brokerage account transactions rose sharply last year.   Fidelity said that at the end of 1990, it had 7,000employees, up 7.9% for the year but well below the 8,100employed at the end of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
