The NSF announced Monday that the centers will receive shares ofa total of $24.7 million during the first year and that futureawards in the five-year program will depend upon available funds andthe progress made by the science centers.   Each center is to concentrate on a special discipline or project,ranging from astrophysics to genetic engineering.   A total of 323 proposals were submitted for consideration. Thisnumber was narrowed to 48 finalists before the final 11 wereselected.   The program is part of a Reagan administration effort to useuniversity expertise to boost national technical innovation.   The winning proposals and their first-year budgets are:   _University of California at Berkeley, Center for ParticleAstrophysics, $1.82 million. Six universities will combine resourcesto search for dark matter that is thought to make up 90 percent ofthe mass of the universe detectableonly by gravitational effects.   _University of California at Santa Barbara, Center for QuantizedElectronic Structures, $2.1 million. Scientists will experiment withways to make very small structures in a new generation of electronicsemiconductors.   _California Institute of Technology, Center for the Developmentof an Integrated Protein and Nucleic Acid Biotechnology, $3.05million. Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory will combineefforts to explore new techniques in genetic engineering and proteinchemistry.   _University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, Center forHigh-Temperature Superconductivity, $4.25 million. Threeuniversities and the Argonne National Laboratory will collaborate onstudies of how to make and use high temperature superconductingmaterials.   _Michigan State University, Center in Microbial Ecology, $1.1million. Scientists will study the physiology and genetics ofmicrobes and relate them to environmental clean-up efforts.   _Northwestern University, Center for Advanced Cement-BasedMaterials, $1.75 million. Scientists at four universities and theNational Institute of Standards and Technology will combine effortsto study the properties and processes of cement, a commonly-used,but poorly-understood building material.   _University of Oklahoma, Center for Analysis and Prediction ofStorms, $900,000. Scientists at the University of Oklahoma and theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will combine effortsto develop mathematical models for predicting tornadoes, flashfloods and severe thunderstorms.   _Rice University, Center for Research on Parallel Computation,$4.1 million. Researchers at two universities and two nationallaboratories will collaborate to help develop advanced computingpower by using small computers processing in parallel to solveproblems.   _University of Rochester, Center for Photoinduced ChargeTransfer, $1.65 million. University scientists will team with thosefrom Eastman Kodak Co. and the Xerox Corp. to investigate how lightdrives some chemical reactions, such as photosynthesis.   _Rutgers University, Center for Discrete Mathematics andTheoretical Computer Science, $1.825 million. Researchers from twouniversities and two companies will combine efforts to advanceunderstanding of mathematics, computers, communications and computerdesign.   _Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Center forHigh-Performance Polymeric Adhesives and Composites, $2.124 million.Scientists will study lightweight composite materials and theirbehavior on a microscopic level. Such materials are now being usedin aircraft, automobiles and building construction.</TEXT></DOC>
