An estimated 300 club-wielding MacDonald supporters clashed withNavajo tribal police Thursday in Window Rock, the 200,000-membertribe's capital.   Two people were killed and nine wounded in the violence, thelatest episode in the struggle for power on the 125,000 square-mileNavajo Reservation, which extends over parts of Arizona, New Mexicoand Utah.   The tribal capital was quiet Sunday as many of the councilmembers and protesters left for the weekend because their homes areseveral hours from Window Rock, officials said.   On Saturday, interim Navajo Tribal Attorney General Herb Yazziecalled for the federal government to indict MacDonald on corruptioncharges and for the tribal prosecutor's office to charge MacDonaldwith violating tribal law.   Those killed in Thursday's violence were members of thePro-Dineh Voters organization, which exists to return MacDonald topower. Three police officers were among the nine wounded.   The tribal Department of Public Safety was a MacDonald ally formost of the three months during which he fought efforts of the newadministration to evict him from the tribe's administrationbuilding.   That changed near the end of April, as Interim Chairman LeonardHaskie pursued a policy of erosion _ leaving MacDonald on an islandof power while taking control of the tribe's purse strings andwinning federal and judicial recognition.   Haskie succeeded in replacing the police chief. Under newleadership, officers on May 24 cleared MacDonald loyalists out ofthe offices where they had slept to prevent just such a takeover.   Lt. Daniel Hawkins led the sweep, and observers said it was noaccident that an attack on Hawkins precipitated the fracas Thursdaywith tribal police coming to his defense.   The violence was not the first in the controversy. Early on, aMacDonald supporter attacked another man with a knife outside theTribal Council Building.   In early April, Haskie backers marched on successive weekends toWindow Rock, where MacDonald supporters were waiting. During thesecond demonstration, police threw tear gas to disperse the crowd.   Amid the larger confrontations, incidents of shouting,name-calling and bad feelings occurred almost daily.   In the council's Feb. 13 action against MacDonald, 49 of the 88council members voted to place the chairman on administrative leavefor investigation of claims that his fourth term was marred bycorruption.   Although MacDonald has not been charged with a crime, testimonydelivered at January hearings of the U.S. Senate Select Committeeon Indian Affairs swayed many Navajos against him. Witnessesdescribed a system of government in which contractors seekingon-reservation work were forced to pay thousands of dollars inkickbacks.   Others testified that MacDonald shared in the $7.2 millionprofit turned by two non-Indian businessmen who bought a ranch andsold it to the tribe less than 24 hours later.   But the council insurgents overlooked the Navajos' respect forMacDonald's leadership qualities, resolute nature and his charisma.Many traditionalists rallied behind MacDonald regardless of thelegal or ethical issues.   MacDonald knew how to play on the passions of his backers, saysDuane Beyal, Haskie's press aide.   ``He's got a silver tongue. There's no denying that,'' Beyalsaid in an interview in Window Rock last April. ``In that way, hefollows in the tradition of the great chiefs. But not in the otherways.''   John Chapela, a Window Rock lawyer, said MacDonald's magnetismwas so strong it could only be countered by videotapes of theSenate hearings.   Chapela said he taped the procedure and visited about one-fourthof the Navajo chapters, or political wards, to show voters whomight have missed the televised sessions.   MacDonald was marshaling his own support.   Within days of his suspension, he began visiting the chapters tooutline his contention that Indian leaders had accepted gifts sincethe dawn of tribal structure as a way to cement friendships for thetribe. His dealings were no different, MacDonald said.   MacDonald's fortunes waned as Haskie's brightened with a seriesof legal victories, including an order from a tribal judgerestraining MacDonald from acting in an official capacity.   MacDonald says it isn't over.   ``There will be more violence,'' he said Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
