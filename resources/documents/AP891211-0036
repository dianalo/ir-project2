(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Freddie Roberts could use a fewlessons from Santa.   Roberts, an inventor in the north-central Tennessee community ofClarksville, was piloting his gyrocopter-turned-Santa's sleigh onSaturday when it stalled at an altitude of about 600 feet. Heescaped injury when he made an emergency landing in a tobaccofield, but his aircraft was damaged.   ``I'm going to have to make new reindeer,'' said Roberts. ``Allthe reindeer got annihilated.''   The modified gyrocopter has a side panel shaped and painted toappear as Santa in his sleigh, being pulled by his reindeer. AtHalloween, he painted the craft to appear as a witch on a broom.   ``I'm hoping there is enough time between now and Christmas toget it back together,'' Roberts said. ``There are going to somedissappointed kids if they don't see Santa Claus flying.''   Roberts said he builds and flies the craft because of theenjoyment it gives children.   He said he learned a few things from Saturday's accident. Forone, he needs a better tail rudder to make a more airworthy sleigh.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President Dan Quayle, whose academicaccomplishments in college were less than stellar, says he likeswhat Albert Einstein once said about education.   ``Einstein once defined education as `that which remains whenone has forgotten everything he learned in school.' I confess thatI've always found this definition rather comforting,'' Quayle said.   ``After all, for some of us, forgetting what we learned inschool isn't all that difficult,'' Quayle said.   Quayle made his remarks after receiving an honorary Doctor ofLaws degree from Yeshiva University at a dinner in a Manhattanhotel.</TEXT><DATELINE>RAYMOND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Local officials have found a way to getresponses to a long survey on the town's rapid growth: a reward.   Officials in the southern Maine community of 3,500 people aregiving respondents a shot at a $250 lottery. So far, 26 percent oftownspeople have responded _ quite an improvement from anotherrecent survey to which less than 2 percent responded.   Raymond is required by state law to adopt a comprehensive growthplan by 1991. The population of the town in southern Maine hasincreased 66 percent since 1980.   ``At first we thought this was kind of tacky _ like an insult tohave a drawing for money, when out of the goodness of their heartsand civic duty people should respond,'' said Chairwoman JackieHewitt of the Raymond Planning Committee.   ``But we knew that in the past this hadn't worked. So we decidedto try a lottery,'' she said.   Questionnaires, with lottery tickets stapled on, were sent outin November. Residents have until January to respond.   Committee members chose the $250 figure because they figured itwould be large enough to attract attention, ``but small enough tonot lead to lying and cheating and stealing,'' said Town ManagerMartin Krauter.   Some want more money.   ``I'd say $250 doesn't do much for people these days,'' said JimPhoenix, owner of Tommy's Sandwich Shop. ``If they'd have made it$1,000, they'd have gotten a lot more responses.''</TEXT></DOC>
