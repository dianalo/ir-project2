Also indicted by the federal grand jury were Abe ``The Trigger''Chapman, a self-styled former Mafia hitman and longtime acquaintanceof Aguilar's, and Rudy Tham, a convicted embezzler for whom Aguilarallegedly interceded.   If convicted of all charges in the eight-count indictment,Aguilar, 58, could be sentenced to 55 years in prison and fined $2million.   The indictment obtained by the Justice Department accuses Aguilarof going to other federal judges and trying to get favorabletreatment for Tham and another felon, Ronald Cloud, a Nevada casinoowner who was convicted of bank fraud. Aguilar has disclosed infinancial statements that he accepted an interest-free, lifetime$12,000 loan from Cloud.   The judge is also accused of tipping off Chapman about a federalwiretap order; advising one of Chapman's lawyers to lie to the grandjury about Aguilar's activities; making false statements to the FBI;and helping his former secretary, attorney Vera Hoff, while she wasa fugitive in Mexico, where she fled after a tax conviction.   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Jimmy Carter, is the firstfederal judge charged with racketeering and the fourth to be accusedof crimes in the last decade.   Unlike most cases brought under the federal racketeering law,Aguilar is not accused of benefiting financially from hisactivities. Instead, the indictment contends the judge used his$89,500-a-year job as a racketeering ``enterprise'' in multiple actsof ``corruptly endeavoring to obstruct, impede, and influence thedue administration of justice.''   Aguilar declined to talk to reporters who went to his home inCampbell near San Jose after the indictment, and attempts by TheAssociated Press to obtain his telephone number were unsuccessful.   Talking to reporters before the long-expected indictment, PatrickHallinan, a lawyer for Aguilar, called the accusations ``hogwash''and contended the judge was being targeted as a minority liberal whohas issued several important rulings against the government.   Federal prosecutors sought the indictment because ``they don'tlike the viewpoint of one judge,'' Hallinan said.   The indictment was issued after Mrs. Hoff, who was arrested inMarch, agreed to testify against Aguilar in a plea bargain with thegovernment.   Aguilar's former secretary broke down in tears while testifyingTuesday afternoon, said her attorney, Randy Sue Pollack.   Mrs. Hoff was promised no additional time for absconding, and aparole hearing in September regarding her two-year prison sentence,her lawyer said.   Violations of a federal law called the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, are punishable by up to 20 yearsin prison.   Hallinan said Aguilar has arranged to turn himself in on July 12or 13. He said he has asked the judge to take a leave from his jobin the San Jose federal court while the charges are pending, thoughnot to resign from office; a federal judge can be removed onlythrough impeachment by Congress.   U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada became the firstjudge this century to be impeached in 1986, two years after he wasconvicted of income tax evasion.   Impeachment is pending against two other federal judges, AlceeHastings of Florida, over allegations stemming from his acquittal onbribery charges, and Walter Nixon of Mississippi, who was convictedof perjury.   The RICO law, passed in 1970, prohibits conducting an``enterprise'' in a pattern of criminal activity, consisting of atleast two specified crimes in a 10-year period. The crimes rangefrom murder and kidnapping to mail fraud, obstruction of justice andinterference with criminal investigations.   The law was aimed at fighting organized crime but has beeninterpreted broadly to apply to a variety of ongoing criminalactivity, including the misuse of a government position such aspolice officer or state judge for personal benefit.</TEXT></DOC>
