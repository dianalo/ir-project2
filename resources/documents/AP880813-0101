The Republican platform is heavy with specifics _ from theheifer tax to protecting ``the Pledge of Allegiance in allschools.''   The Democratic document is much slimmer and sticks to themes _from ``the American dream of opportunity'' to ``good jobs at goodwages.''   The Democratic platform is about 5,000 words; the GOP documentmore than 30,000.   ``What we have done is be overly specific. If there is anycomplaint you can make, it is going to be tough for someone to readthe whole thing. But we're not planning on people doing that,''said Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, a Republican PlatformCommittee co-chairman. ``We were rushing in order to emphasize thevagueness in the Democratic platform by becoming specific in ours.''   The Republicans bash Michael Dukakis over and over again _without ever mentioning his name, calling him only ``the Democraticpresidential nominee.'' The Democrats never mentioned George Bushor Ronald Reagan _ and included the word ``Republican'' only once.   Party platforms are not crucial documents that shape the courseof the presidential campaign. Few people outside the party faithfuleven read the rhetoric. And presidents don't usually feel bound byplatform promises when they take office.   But this year, the platforms do provide a reading on what thecandidates want to tell the voters.   And this year, each document is undoubtedly what each party'snominee wanted. While the candidates had to make some concessions _Bush to the hard-line conservatives and Dukakis to Jesse Jackson _those adjustments were really at the margins.   ``The vice president is comfortable with this platform,''declared aide Charlie Black on Friday as the GOP platform committeewrapped up its work.   Committee chairman Kay Orr, the Nebraska governor, said Bushcalled her Saturday morning to say he was proud of the document.   The GOP planks are resolutely conservative, stronglyanti-communist and anti-abortion with a leavening of stances onsuch non-traditional issues as day care.   The Democrats' is a mix of liberal touchstones such as a``full-employment economy,'' the Equal Rights Amendment andabortion availabilty, accompanied by conservative-soundingdeclarations such as ``a strong commitment to fiscalresponsibility.''   The Star Wars missile defense system, aid to the Contras andopposition to the creation of a Palestinian state highlight a GOPforeign policy plank that boasts of Reagan administration successesand promises more of the same.   The Democratic document says, ``We will cease dealing with drugsmugglers and seek to reconcile our differences with countries inCentral America.'' It also talks of ``clearheaded, tough-minded,decisive American foreign policy'' and ``a role of responsibleactive international leadership.''   The Republicans were quick to say that they had covered all themajor issues, while accusing the Democrats of ``ducking 125 majorissues'' ranging from tax increases to pornography.   The Democrats accused their opponents of retreading the 1980 and1984 platforms, ``talking about the future through a rear-viewmirror.''   Rhetoric aside, both platforms duck difficult issues. TheRepublicans talk about Bush's flexible budget freeze withoutexplaining how promised new programs _ and ``rapid and certaindeployment'' of the Strategic Defense Initiative _ could be paidfor.   The Democrats talk about finding the ``resources'' to pay forgovernment programs without ever mentioning the dreaded ``t'' word_ taxes.   Of course, there are many themes that are shared by theplatforms.   There are commitments to equal rights, a strong economy and astrong defense, a clean environment and drug-free schools.   One interesting similarity is that both talk about the need forchange.   Obviously, the Democrats focused on change because they want tochange control of the White House after eight years in Republicanhands.   ``We believe it is time for America to change and move forwardagain in the interest of all its families,'' says the Democraticplatform, ``to turn away from an era in which too many of America'schildren have been homeless or hungry and invest in a new era ofhope and progress, an era of secure families in a secure America ina secure world.''   But Bush and the Republicans, seeking to build on the Reaganlegacy, are also talking about change _ no doubt because the pollssay Americans want changes in the nation's direction.   ``An election is about the future, about change,'' says the GOPplatform preamble. ``Americans want leadership to direct the forcesof change, on America's terms, guided by American values.''   ``The election will bring change. The question is: Will it bechange and progress with the Republicans or change and chaos withthe Democrats?''   Change will come to the White House in 1989 no matter who iselected. And the 1988 party platforms are a decent navigational aidfor figuring out what changes in course may be coming.</TEXT><TEXT>   _   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Evans Witt is a Washington-based politicalwriter who covered the platform committee's deliberations.</TEXT></DOC>
