Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/24/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> SCOTT TOWNSHIP, Pa.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Most days, Carol Divens Rothbelieves God called her to the ministry. Other days, thatbelief is sorely tested.   The 37-year-old Presbyterian vividly remembers summer vacations at church camp and teen-age dreams of becoming a missionary. Then, in 1982, she left her career as a journalist and enrolled in theological school. At graduation, she won three awards, including one for preaching.    That was a year and a half ago. She has since applied to become a minister at 10 parishes -- and received 10 rejection letters. Churches told her, she says, that they were looking for a minister with more experience or that they had found someone who better met their needs. But Ms. Roth isn't convinced those were the real reasons.    &quot;Whenever a rejection came, I could never be sure if it was me and my qualifications or because I'm a woman,&quot; Ms. Roth says. &quot;I started to ask myself if maybe I didn't have a call after all.&quot; She finally found an associate-pastor position at Covenant Community Presbyterian Church here. It is only a part-time job, but she says she is delighted to have it.    A decade or so after most Protestant denominations began allowing women to be ordained as ministers, many still feel unwelcome in America's pulpits. Similar feelings are voiced by some of the nation's 130 or so female rabbis, who form a tiny minority of the more than 4,000 rabbis in the U.S. and aren't allowed at all in the Orthodox Jewish faith. (Women still can't become Roman Catholic priests, nor can they become ministers in branches of some Protestant denominations.)    Ordained women have trouble finding jobs leading congregations, are locked out of top spots and occasionally face open criticism and harassment. &quot;We're in a constant battle between finding a job, surviving and compromising in order to keep our jobs,&quot; says the Rev. Margaret Rose, the curate at the Church of St. John the Evangelist, an Episcopal church in Boston.    Churchgoers' objections to women ministers are varied. &quot;There is a tradition of the minister as being a male that is deeply ingrained {in society} and very difficult to change,&quot; says the Rev. David Smock, executive associate to the president of the United Church of Christ. &quot;Sexism exists in the church as it does in other institutions.&quot; In some cases, church members cite Bible passages as condemning the idea of women playing significant roles in the church. Others fear that women ministers will change traditional church practices for the worse.    The debate is intensifying because of the rising number of women in the ministry. Women constitute 8% to 10% of the American ministers in Protestant denominations that ordain women, double the percentage in 1977, estimates the National Council of Churches. What's more, women's enrollment in seminaries soared to 14,572 last year, or 26% of the total, from just 3,358, or 10%, in 1972 in the U.S. and Canada. In some seminaries -- including Harvard Divinity School -- women outnumber men.    Despite the growth in their numbers, women ministers remain second-class citizens in many ways. Male pastors earned a median salary of $20,000 to $22,000 a year, or some 30% more than women, according to a 1982 survey by the National Council of Churches, which still believes the disparities in treatment between the sexes are great. And women aren't moving up the ranks quickly, either. For example, while 8.5% of United Methodist ministers were women in 1984, the latest year for which figures are available, only two of the church's 45 bishops are women; and there aren't any female Episcopal bishops, though women make up 4.3% of the denomination's ministers.    Susan Hiatt, a theologian in Cambridge, Mass., fears that as more females join the ministry, it will be allowed to become a &quot;pink-collar ghetto&quot; like social work and nursing, where women make up the rank and file but not the leadership. Already, she says, waning prestige of the job related to its low pay and declining status in American society is causing male flight.    Women ministers say that antagonism against them isn't always subtle. When the Rev. Joan Hamlin became the pastor at two small United Methodist parishes in rural Michigan last year, she says, she was bluntly told by a member of the pastor-parish committee that officials who appointed her &quot;had scraped the bottom of the barrel and made a big mistake.&quot;    Other women ministers say small indignities are all too common. Ms. Rose, the curate in Boston, says that several months ago outside her church a male passerby who said he was a priest stared at her and shouted: &quot;What makes you think your orders are valid?&quot; And the Rev. Katie Cannon, a black theologian at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass., recalls strolling into a New York hotel -- donned in a clergy robe and collar -- for a ministers' meeting when a young man grabbed her shoulders, threw her against a wall and cried, &quot;How dare you defy the name of Jesus Christ?&quot; She attributes her reception to both her sex and her race.    Among those who oppose women ministers on biblical grounds, a favorite citation is 1 Corinthians 14:34, which states: &quot;As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.&quot;    Women theologians argue that the Bible was written at a time when females were expected to hold submissive roles and maintain that the passages aren't applicable today. Nonetheless, many members of the Southern Baptist Convention -- in which women make up just 2% of the church's nearly 17,000 ordained ministers -- are trying to stop ordaining women. &quot;The overwhelming majority of the convention feels that it's not appropriate to ordain women, based on biblical interpretations,&quot; says the Rev. Robert Sorrell, associate pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn., where he assists the convention's president.    But women face many obstacles even in those denominations where they have considerable support. Various studies have found that a lower percentage of women got pastor positions after graduation than did men. Out of Ms. Roth's graduating class at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in May 1985, for example, 15 of the 20 Presbyterian men who graduated are working as pastors; the other men have found jobs as associate ministers. But only five of the 14 women graduates are full-time pastors. (Of the remaining women, eight work either as associate or interim pastors or for social agencies; one is still looking for a church job.)    Ms. Roth, who is married and has two young daughters, hasn't given up hope of becoming a pastor. And she has received official encouragement. She was interviewed for a minister's position by five parishes and was among the three finalists for one job. &quot;She's a fine person, a great organizer and will make a fine minister,&quot; says the head of the church's nominating committee.    But the parish hired a man whom it deemed more &quot;assertive,&quot; the committee head adds. The parish official insists that Ms. Roth wasn't turned down because she is a woman, but Ms. Roth has her doubts. &quot;The church has to help women ministers and minority people get {more} jobs. It's not going to happen on its own,&quot; she says.    Among those women who do head congregations, leadership style can be an issue -- especially when the women do things differently from their male predecessors. Rabbi Shira Stern of Monroe Township (N.J.) Jewish Center began using non-sexist language three years ago. &quot;I try not to use any pronouns, male or female, because God reflects all of life,&quot; she explains. &quot;Instead of he, I use you; instead of king, I use ruler; instead of God of our fathers, I say God of our ancestors.&quot; But an older woman in the congregation told Ms. Stern that she couldn't pray during the service when the rabbi stopped using masculine references to God.    Beverly Gaska, a United Methodist minister in Michigan, was accused of being indecisive by members of a parish group when she sought their advice on Advent services; her male predecessors had dictated how the services would be run. &quot;I was into consulting on decisions they thought I should make,&quot; Ms. Gaska says. &quot;It's just my style to be participatory.&quot;    Some churchgoers leave for another parish after a woman pastor arrives. Three weeks after Mrs. Hamlin was named the pastor at the two United Methodist parishes in rural Burnips and Monterey, Mich., an extended family of 17 left the Monterey church; their departure cut the church's membership nearly in half. &quot;I approve of women for Sunday-school teachers and song leaders but not for ministers,&quot; says Weldon Wuiss, the head of that family, citing biblical passages. &quot;The man should be the head of the family and the head of the church.&quot;    Mrs. Hamlin's appointment as pastor to the two small parishes (the Monterey church now has 25 members, the Burnips church 70) was itself a reflection of problems women ministers face. A recent study found that women in the United Methodist Church are more likely than men to be appointed to less prestigious &quot;multiple-point charges,&quot; usually two, but sometimes as many as three, smaller churches often too poor to afford pastors of their own.    At the same time, her husband, Fred, with whom she graduated from a seminary in May 1985, was assigned to a larger, 164-member parish in Byron Center, Mich. Though Mr. Hamlin had some previous experience as a pastor at another church, his wife also had preached at the same church and helped plan services. &quot;I knew she worked just as hard as me. I hurt for her,&quot; says Mr. Hamlin.    Though disappointed by the reception from some parishioners, Mrs. Hamlin vows to persevere. Dorothy Oakes, a member of the Burnips church, is glad. She notes that Mrs. Hamlin, among other activities, has started a program to contact church members who don't show up on Sunday to make sure they aren't sick. &quot;Now people feel that someone cares,&quot; Ms. Oakes says.    Indeed, despite her problems, Joan Hamlin -- like many other women ministers -- finds the ministry gratifying and thus wouldn't change professions. As for those who haven't accepted her, she says: &quot;I never let rejection be the bottom line for me.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
