Cease-fire talks under a March 23 agreement with the Contrarebels remained snagged on security issues with deep mistrust onboth sides. A fragile temporary truce was generally holding, butthe future remained uncertain.   Seven weeks after historic meetings in the border town of Sapoabrought an unexpected hope of peace, deep differences still dividethe two sides. Two more rounds of talks in Managua have left themwithout even an agreement on where and when to continuenegotiations.   Meanwhile, internal problems grew for the leftist governmentlast week with a hunger strike by more than 30 workers demandinghigher wages. The workers ended their 10-day fast in Managua afterthe government agreed to begin salary negotiations on Monday, unionleaders said.   The construction workers and car mechanics held their hungerstrike at the Socialist General Workers Federation headquarters.While they were holed up inside, Sandinista special forces policebroke up demonstrations outside with rubber truncheons and detainedmore than 70 supporters.   The Sandinistas also barred civilian movement around the unionhall, detained Nicaraguans without charge, and suspended severalradio news shows accused of broadcasting false information aboutthe strike.   It was the most blatant show of government repression since aregional peace plan was signed Aug. 7 by the presidents ofNicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras. Theplan to end fighting in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala alsocalled for democratic reforms.   The government's handling of the hunger strike stood in sharpcontrast to its openly conciliatory statements toward the Contrasand prompted criticism from both rightists and far leftists.   ``Talk with the workers, not with Contras,'' said a poster fromthe Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement.   Erick Ramirez, president of the Social Christian Party, chargedthe government with restricting liberties without using the laws.   The hunger strikers joined workers, claiming to number 4,500,who walked off their jobs Feb. 25 to demand more pay and protesteconomic measures enacted Feb. 15.   The steps, designed to end the black market and cut inflation,included issuing a new currency and setting new wage scales andprice structures. Inflation is officially placed at an annual rateof 1,800 percent, unofficially at 7,000 percent.   The Sandinistas say the war with the rebels has caused more than$3 billion in damage.   Prices set by the government in February jumped in the openmarkets because state-run supermarket shelves were bare as usual.   Black marketeers also returned. The official rate of the cordobais 11 for $1, yet the illegal market puts the exchange at 85 to $1.   According to the Sandinistas, the price of a pound of rice is 4cordobas, but it sells for 25. Cooking oil, scarce for years, sellsfor 100 cordobas instead of the government-mandated 12.   The Soviet bloc continues to help with more than $500 million ineconomic aid yearly. The total of East bloc military aid is a statesecret.   The United States cut off all aid to Nicaragua in 1981.President Reagan recently renewed U.S. trade sanctions in effectsince 1985.   The U.S. Embassy said: ``The effect of the sanctions has been toincrease Nicaragua's costs of trade, although alternative marketshave been found for everything the country can produce and manyU.S.-made goods are still obtainable at higher prices.''   To further bolster the crippled economy, the government begancutbacks that will eliminate 20,000 state jobs, mostly among lowerlevel staunch Sandinista supporters.   ``The economic difficulties are of such a magnitude that wedon't have any alternative,'' Interior Minister Tomas Borge saidrecently. ``We have to put these people into the productionsector.''   Thousands of rural peasants who would otherwise be sowing cropshave fled to the capital, where a third of the country's populationof 3 million lives, to escape fighting.   The battles started in November 1981, less than a 1{ years afterthe Sandinistas came to power in a revolutionary war that overthrewthe distatorship of late President Anastasio Somoza.   ``The general mood is the government doesn't know what to do andthe economic situation doesn't have any way out until there ispeace and a new, acceptable government,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, vicepresident of the anti-government Private Enterprise Council.   The 60-day cease-fire signed in Sapoa and begun April 1 hadlargely held until this past week, when two violations werereported.   Sandinista army troops said rebels attacked government soldiers140 miles southeast of Managua on Thursday, wounding four. TheDefense Ministry also said Contras based at a Honduran naval basein the Gulf of Fonseca used speedboats to raid a governmentmilitary position on Wednesday.   A commander for the Indian rebel group Yatama, in the Caribbeancoast region, said government troops recently attacked rebelpositions 270 miles northeast of Managua.</TEXT></DOC>
