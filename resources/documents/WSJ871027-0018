But some corporate treasurers and other financial executives fear a weakening dollar could dampen the huge bond market rally and even drive interest rates back up.    The Fed, which has aggressively pumped reserves into the banking system the past week, could cut its discount rate half a percentage point to 5 1/2% as early as this week, some economists contend.    As the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 156.83 points yesterday -- its largest decline after a 508.00 point drop Oct. 19 -- a big rally swept through the credit markets. Prices of some 30-year government bonds rose 2 1/8 points, or almost $21.25 for each $1,000 face amount, in brisk trading. Rates on Treasury bills, top-grade bank certificates of deposit and other money market securities also declined as much as 0.2 percentage point as worried investors continued to seek a refuge from the battered equity market.    Since Oct. 16, prices of some long-term Treasury bonds have rallied 14 1/2 points, as yields fell from a high of 10.45% to about 8.9%.    &quot;The Fed will cut the discount rate half a percentage point anytime now,&quot; said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;Anybody who buys bonds is protected because the Fed isn't going to let interest rates rise while there's so much fear of recession.&quot;    A reduction in the discount rate, or the borrowing fee the Fed charges banks and other financial institutions, &quot;may be delayed because it's such a visible easing move,&quot; said David M. Jones, a senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. Whatever the case, &quot;the Fed is flooding the banking system with reserves and people will be surprised how effective easier money and lower interest rates will be towards cushioning the stock crash,&quot; he said.    Some financial executives, however, worry that the Fed's looser monetary policy could drive down the dollar against other major currencies and thereby force rates to rise again. &quot;We are much too dependent on foreign holders of our debt,&quot; said Wayland F. Blood, vice president and treasurer at Ford Motor Credit Co. &quot;I think the Fed is in a box and the risk is that interest rates go north as the economy goes south&quot; in the months ahead.    The bond market rally currently is being driven &quot;by money pouring in from the equity markets,&quot; said Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, a private investment bank. &quot;If you take a longer view, there's a pretty good chance the dollar will fall and interest rates will rise unless the president and Congress agree to a multi-year reduction in the budget deficit that goes far beyond the $23 billion now under negotiation.    &quot;Unfortunately, I don't see that happening right now in Washington,&quot; added Mr. Peterson, a former U.S. secretary of commerce. &quot;Every analysis of a financial crisis shows that the initial tendency of politicians was to take small steps and then delay.&quot;    David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., said he and other financial executives recently lobbied congressmen for &quot;a bipartisan national commission to reduce the deficit over several years&quot; in the wake of the stock market crash. But he wasn't encouraged by the response. &quot;The gap in perception between Wall Street and Congress right now is very wide,&quot; he said, noting that &quot;most legislators think we should all be happy with a $23 billion cut in the deficit.&quot;    Despite these problems, interest rates could fall another 0.9 percentage point in coming weeks as the Fed &quot;continues to operate in its fire-fighting mode,&quot; said Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. Yields of between 8 1/2% and 8% on 30-year benchmark government bonds &quot;are likely before the year is over,&quot; he predicts.    Banks' prime, or base lending, rates &quot;will fall to 8% or lower by the end of the year along with many mortgage rates as the Fed proves successful&quot; limiting the crisis to the financial community, said Mr. Jones of Aubrey Lanston.    In the wake of the stock market collapse last week, most banks cut their prime rates 0.25 percentage point to 9%, the first reduction since August last year. Since then, the prime had been increased five times.    &quot;There's been a knee-jerk reaction to the stock market plunge that assumes it will lead to a recession,&quot; said Mr. Jones. While the inflation-adjusted gross national product may average about 2% instead of 3% growth over the next three quarters, &quot;we may find nine months from now that the bear market in bonds only was postponed and that we're back in the soup again.&quot;    While the stock market debacle already has sparked the biggest bond market rally ever in a seven-day period, &quot;we still face the danger that our trade and budget deficits will cause foreign investors to drive down the dollar and push up interest rates,&quot; Mr. Jones said.    Mr. Capra of Shearson Lehman, who also expects Fed easing to prevent a recession, agrees. &quot;Sometime next year, we may begin to see 10% or higher yields on long-term government bonds as the trade and budget problems resurface.    Mark Tavel, a senior economist at Value Line Inc., said he expects confidence to return to the stock market in a month or so as &quot;the Fed helps push yields on (30-year) Treasury bonds down to 8%. I expect a cut in the discount rate anytime now.&quot;    In yesterday's activity, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 22.6 points to 1257.03. The index ranged from 1247.87 to 1258.70. On Friday, the index fell 0.68 point to 1234.43.    Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose to 99 3/4 from 97 5/8 Friday as the yield fell to 8.9%. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 rose to a price of 99 1/4 from 97 3/4 Friday, as the yield declined to 8.74% from 8.97%    The rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 5.17% bidfrom 5.30% bid Friday. The rate on six-month bills fell to5.90% bid from 6% bid Friday. At the Treasury's auction ofthree- and six-month bills yesterday, the average annualyields were 5.12% and 5.98%, respectively, down from 6.84%and 7.24% at last week's regularly scheduled auction. The newthree-month bill rate was the lowest since Oct. 6 last year,when it was 5.08%. The new six-month bill rate was the lowestsince last July, when it was 5.54%.   The rate on federal funds, which are reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7.22%, up from 7% Friday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.)A). Analysts said the rise was technical and didn't signal any change in the Fed's easier credit stance.    In the corporate new-issue market, activity was relatively light despite the large drop in Treasury bond yields. Among the largest offerings:    --A $300 million issue of Eastman Kodak Co. notes due November 1991. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the 8 5/8% notes at 99.588 to yield 8.749%, or 0.5 percentage point more than the Treasury four-year note. The notes are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $200 million issue of African Development Bank notes due November 1997. Underwriters led by Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. priced the notes at par to yield 10%, or 1.19 percentage point more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's and double-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of ITT Financial Corp. notes due November 1992. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the notes at par to yield 9 1/4%, or 0.875 percentage point less than the Treasury's five-year note. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, Ohio Water Development Authority and Ohio Air Quality Development Authorities jointly sold $111 million collaterized pollution control revenue bonds for the Toledo Edison and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. The bonds were priced by a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. group to yield 9.625% in 2022. The issue is rated Baa-2 by Moody's and triple-B-minus by Sandamp;P.    Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                               13-Week            26-Week Applications .......... $20,396,620,000    $20,201,090,000 Accepted bids .......... $6,406,720,000     $6,405,440,000 Accepted at low price ............. 39%                81% Accepted noncompet'ly .. $1,108,575,000       $857,520,000 Average price (Rate) .... 98.706(5.12%)      96.977(5.98%) High price (Rate) ....... 98.736(5.00%)      97.037(5.86%) Low price (Rate) ........ 98.698(5.15%)      96.967(6.00%) Coupon equivalent ............... 5.27%              6.27%   Both issues are dated Oct. 29.
