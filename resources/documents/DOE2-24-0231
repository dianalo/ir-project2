Hydrostaticpressures using argon as the pressurizing medium were obtained in a simpleMerrill-Bassett-type diamond anvil cell. Pressures were measured by theruby fluorescence method. The 160-mCi {sup 151}SmF{sub 3} source andthe absorbers were held at the same temperature. The small sample size(about 8 {mu}g) and rather large source diameter necessitated countingtimes of about one day per datum. Raw f-values of about 15% near 100K reflected the efficient collimation of the 90 Ta 10 W gasket used/1/.7 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
