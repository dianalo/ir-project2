In addition to the absence of a permanent appointee to the newpost of Commerce Department undersecretary for technology, theeffort also is being hampered by lack of money for a key program atthe department's National Institute of Standards and Technology.   ``I'm deeply concerned about it,'' said Rep. George E. Brown Jr.,D-Calif., who closely follows technology issues on Capitol Hill.   ``I would say that at this point the administration has not gottheir act together: first, in terms of making the key appointmentsthat would be involved in policy in this area; and, of course,establishing the policy framework necessary to be able to go ahead.''   Brown is a member of the House science, research and technologysubcommittee, which is set to hear testimony Tuesday by ErnestAmbler, who last December was named acting undersecretary fortechnology but is planning to retire at the end of March.   At his confirmation hearing in January, Commerce Secretary RobertA. Mosbacher said the role of the undersecretary for technology ``isan extremely high priority'' and that he was concerned about U.S.capability in high technology.   So far, however, Mosbacher has been unable find a willingcandidate for the undersecretary job, which pays $82,500 a year.   Brown said a number of people _ including Mary L. Good,chairwoman of the National Science Board, which oversees theNational Science Foundation _ had been offered the post but hadturned it down.   Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., said the failure to implement a pay raisefor Congress, the judiciary and top federal executives apparentlyfigured in the decisions by several people who would have had totake a substantial cut from their private-sector incomes.   Under a reorganization plan approved by Congress late last year,Commerce's new Technology Administration includes:   _The Office of Technology Policy, a policy analysis anddevelopment organization;   _The Office of Commercial Affairs, which promote cooperativejoint ventures with U.S. industry in areas of research andtechnology development;   _The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST,which works in areas ranging from automated manufacturing,electronics and materials research to computer science andtechnology, building and fire research, and biotechnology;   _The National Telecommunications and Information Administration,responsible for developing federal telecommunications technologypolicies;   _The National Technical Information Service, which disseminatesthe results of government-sponsored research.   Ambler said in a speech last month that the office of theundersecretary for technology ``is a catalyst, a friend, a forum, alistening post and a voice in Washington for technology-basedindustry.''   At the same time, he emphasized that ``it is the job of theprivate sector to develop and sell goods and services. Governmenthas never been successful in showing industry how to do its job, andthere is absolutely no reason to think that will change in thefuture.''   Legislation passed last fall also established within NIST anAdvanced Technology Program, intended to be a civilian counterpartof the Pentagon's highly touted Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency.   The program is designed to coordinate development ofemerging-technologies and manufacturing-research consortia; fosterindustry, government and university partnerships, and monitorcooperation between federal and regional agencies.   However, so far the program has no funding either for this fiscalyear or in the fiscal 1990 budget.   Brown said that in the absence of leadership by theadministration on issues related to civilian technology, ``we may goahead with proposed legislation which would compel them to startfocusing on this.''   ``What we also need are some short-term decisions having to dowith selecting targets of opportunity and providing some funding forcivilian advanced technology projects this fiscal year,'' theCalifornia Democrat said.   Ritter, who serves along with Brown on the science, research andtechnology subcommittee, said that after a meeting last Wednesdaywith Mosbacher, he is optimistic about the longer-range prospectsfor developing the Technology Administration into an effectiveagency.   ``I think that given the feelings of the secretary of commerce,it's going to be an important new feature on the landscape,'' thePennsylvania Republican said. ``I think he's committed to it. Hejust has to get people to work for him.''</TEXT></DOC>
