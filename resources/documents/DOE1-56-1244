The influence on the climateof the rising atmospheric content of carbon dioxide (CO/sub 2/) has becomean important problem, which constitutes the background to energy policy.This problem has become more and more topical and multi-faceted overthe past decade. Extreme climatic anomalies occur in various regionsof the earth, which had not previously been experienced in this intensityin our century. Even more extreme weather and climatic events must beexpected to occur in the future. From the most recent data climatologistsconclude that the development will be different than had initially beenassumed. For instance, the role of water vapor seems to have been underestimated.A change in climate, starting from the tropics, seems to be under way.The modeling results, which must be used as a starting point for specificpredictions in any field, are still highly contradictory and do not atpresent permit a forecast to be made for a region such as Central Europe.It can only be said with some reliability that the process of warmingup will continue, perhaps even at an increasing pace.</TEXT></DOC>
