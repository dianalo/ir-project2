Arch A.Moore Jr. was sentenced yesterday to five years and 10 monthsin prison and was fined $170,000 for a scheme to extort moneyfrom a coal operator and buy votes.   The 67-year-old Mr. Moore, a three-term Republicangovernor, pleaded guilty in April to charges of extortion,obstruction of justice, and tax and mail fraud. He faced amaximum penalty of 36 years in prison and fines of as much as$1.2 million.</LP><TEXT>   It's not clear whether Mr. Moore will appeal. He couldn'tbe reached for comment.   Attorneys for Mr. Moore had asked to withdraw the guiltyplea, saying the former governor was rushed into his plea.But federal Judge Walter Hoffman denied the request Monday.The former governor remains free on bond until July 31, whenhe is scheduled to report to a minimum-security prison inPetersburg, Va.   Michael W. Carey, a U.S. attorney in West Virginia, calledthe sentence significant and proof that even former WestVirginia governors go to jail if they &quot;violate the publictrust.&quot;   The judge sentenced Mr. Moore to concurrent terms of fiveyears for extortion, six months for mail fraud and two yearsfor each of two charges of tax fraud. In addition, he wassentenced to 10 months in prison on the obstruction ofjustice charge.   Prosecutors say Mr. Moore illegally diverted $100,000 instate funds to his 1984 election campaign, which hissupporters used to buy votes from residents in southern WestVirginia counties.   The extortion charge relates to a scheme in which heagreed to use his influence as governor to refund $2.3million from the state's black-lung fund to a coal operator.In return, the coal operator agreed to offer Mr. Moore 25% ofthe refund in kickbacks, according to the indictments by theCharleston grand jury.   The black-lung fund is a coal industry-funded pool ofmoney that provides payments to disabled miners who sufferfrom the disease.   The tax fraud counts allege that Mr. Moore filed falsecampaign finance statements and tax returns in 1984 and 1985.The obstruction of justice charge related to Mr. Moore'salleged attempt to influence the testimony of two witnessesduring the investigation.   Mr. Moore served as governor from 1969 to 1977 and from1985 to 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
