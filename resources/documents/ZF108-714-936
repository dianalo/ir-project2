 is on the verge of abandoning another vital industry to theJapanese.andP;  U.S.andP;  software suppliers are accomplishing this by a combinationof greed and shortsightedness.andM;Japan's economy is at a critical juncture.andP;  The country's growth andprosperity have been built on mass production.andP;  Japan now has the world'shighest quality and most advanced manufacturing facilities and technology.andO;And its wages are among the world's highest.andP;  Japan's prosperity cannotendure if its economy continues to depend on mass production.andM;Japan must convert itself to an information-intensive economy.andP;  To convertsuccessfully, Japan must modernize its offices.andP;  In this area, Japan lags farbehind every industrialized nation.andP;  Today, 36 million of the 61 millionpersons employed in Japan work at desks, and the productivity of office workis very low.andM;While Japan's factories, warehouses and transportation systems are the mostmodern in the world, its office workers use the same paper, pencils, erasers,scissors and paste that were popular in Charles Dickens' time.andP;  Per capitause of PCs in Japan's offices is one-half that of Western Europe andone-fourth that of the U.S.andM;Some leaders think the reason for this is that the computer industry is notserving the needs of Japan adequately.andP;  The computers need to be small,powerful, easy to use and inexpensive.andP;  Computer manufacturers are notproviding these products.andP;  So Japan's consumer electronics industry, theworld's best, is now turning its attention to Japan's desks and offices withstandards pioneered in the U.S.andM;Japanese electronics manufacturers have shrunk the size of PCs, runningMicrosoft's MS-DOS, to that of a notebook.andP;  They have reduced the weight ofthese PCs to about five pounds.andP;  Competition has driven the price of thesesystems to under $1,000.andM;As a result, companies can afford to buy them for all office workers.andP;  In myTokyo-based company, 575 of 625 employees have a book-size computer.andM;The Japanese are also supplying workstations for office workers who need morepower, and servers for groups of office workers.andP;  ATandamp;T's Unix is rapidlybecoming the standard for workstations and servers.andP;  All these machines arerevolutionizing Japan's desks and offices.andM;SEVERE SOFTWARE SHORTAGEandM;This has exposed another problem: a severe shortage of software.andP;  U.S.andO;companies buy 60% of their software off-the-shelf.andP;  In Western Europe, 40% ofthe software is off-the-shelf.andP;  In Japan, only 10% of the software isready-made; 90% is custom-made.andM;The reasons are easy to understand.andP;  Most of Japan's software companies wereestablished to smooth major corporations' fluctuating needs for computerengineers.andP;  The current demand for custom-made software is so great in Japanthat its software companies make a good living without taking the risk ofproducing packaged products.andM;Demand for custom software is much greater than it would be if more packagedproducts were available.andP;  Japan is in a vicious circle.andM;Solving this software shortage is a critical national problem for Japan, andJapan will solve the issue.andM;Japan needs software at much lower prices.andP;  Software products for mainframesare priced at least 50% higher in Japan than in the U.S.andP;  Lotus DevelopmentCorp.'s 1-2-3 sells for three times its U.S.andP;  price in Japan.andP;  Thus,spreadsheets, word processing packages and other products cost almost as muchas a book-type computer.andM;High software prices are inhibiting Japan's efforts to convert its economy.andO;Consequently, Japanese companies have begun creating software productscompetitive with the best software from the U.S.andP;  The products are built toaddress the needs of the Japanese market; they are high-quality, and fullydocumented in the Japanese language.andM;The Japanese software authors rely on publishers and distributors to setprices and terms of sale for their products, in terms that will maximizereturn for all.andM;The evidence of change is dramatic.andP;  In 1988, 99% of our revenues came fromimports, and 1% from selling Japanese products.andP;  In 1989, just under 95% ofour revenues came from imports, and 5% from Japanese products.andP;  This year, weare forecasting that less than 80% of our revenues will come from imports,and more than 20% from Japanese software.andM;Increasingly, we are finding the Japanese are supplying better products thatfit the market better, and we can distribute them on better terms.andP;  This isan ominous trend for the U.S.andP;  software industry.andM;Totten is the founder and president of K.K.andP;  Ashisuto, headquartered inTokyo, a software distributor and developer.andP;  His company has 625 employees,and sold $60 million of American software in Japan in 1989.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
