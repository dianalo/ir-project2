Some firefighters spent the weekend on standby because of theheightened fire danger caused by the drought, and some Indianacommunities put off their Fourth of July fireworks displays untillater in the summer in hope of rain.   In Minnesota, the Hare Krishna League of Devotees of Minneapolisoffered to do its part with what was billed as an emergency raindance and chanting session.   The chants will work because ``the real reason there is no rainis that there is not enough sacrifice to God, so things are beingrestricted by God,'' said group Krishna-Katha.   Sunday was declared ``a statewide day of prayer for rain'' inIllinois by Gov. James R. Thompson.   ``The people of this ... state need to come to their senses andtheir knees to seek an end to the drought,'' said Illinois'Assistant House Minority Leader Penny Pullen.   In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the forest fire mostly within theHiawatha National Forest was contained by fire lines Sunday morningand crew were using hand tools to extinguish lingering embers. Twofirefighters had been injured.   About 60 families returned early Saturday to their homes alongLake Michigan's Little Bay de Noc after being evacuated Fridaynight, a spokeswoman. Two outbuildings were destroyed Friday, shesaid.   Michigan state crews alone have battled at least 438 firesstatewide this year, compared with an average 352 fires in each ofthe previous five years.   Minnesota's Department of Natural Resource firefighting crewswere on standby over the holiday weekend to douse any flames causedby fireworks above tinder-dry fields. Five fires in the Cambridgearea of central Minnesota were started by illegal firecrackersFriday, said DNR spokesman Tom Baumann.   Franklin, Tenn., banned fireworks, including the city's ownscheduled Fourth of July display. But firefighters were on alertthrough Monday in the anticipation of blazes started by peopleusing fireworks despite the ban, Williamson County EmergencyManagement Director Mike Thompson said.   ``One-fourth of our manpower have to remain close to the mainstation'' for the holiday, Thompson said.   Some Indiana communities also called off fireworks displays, butrescheduled them for later in the summer in hopes of rain.   ``We are having as lot of postponements. You may be seeing showsfrom now until Halloween,'' said Ross Perri, vice president ofPrincess Fireworks Inc. of Mishawaka, Ind.   The danger of fireworks and the drought was obvious Saturday toJim Wagner, who operates a fireworks stand in Roseland, Ind. He hadto put out a grass fire less than 50 yards from his stand whensomeone threw a lit smoke bomb.   The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency has warned hunters thatgame animals may suffer long-range effects of the prolonged hot,dry weather.   ``We don't want to paint an entirely bleak picture, but peopleshould be prepared to face the harsh reality that some things willbe different,'' said Ged Petit, information officer for the stateagency.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has already instructedTennessee and Kentucky to cut duck hunting bag limits from fourducks to two. And the daily bag limit for squirrels has beenreduced from 10 to six.   ``I've been in the business 25 years and until the other day I'dnever seen a squirrel drinking water in my bird bath,'' Petit said.``That showed me it's bad.''</TEXT></DOC>
