The proposed regulation would constitute a new subpartA of 42 CFR Part 110_Vaccine Information Materials and would implementsection 2126 of the Public Health Service Act which requires developmentand dissemination of such materials.

Orenstein, M.D., Director,Division of Immunization, Center for Prevention Services, Centers for DiseaseControl, Atlanta, Georgia 30333.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This NPRM and the appended vaccineinformation materials implement Title XXI, section 2126 (42 U.S.C. 300aa-26).Title XXI was amended by Pub. L. 100-203, approved December 22, 1987. Section2126 requires the Secretary to develop and disseminate information materialson the vaccines included in the Vaccine Injury Table. These vaccines includethose which immunize against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; measles,mumps, and rubella; and poliomyelitis. Health care providers must distributethese materials to adults about to receive any of the covered vaccinesand to the legal representatives of any child about to receive a vaccine.This section requires that the materials be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and specifically requires that the materialsbe developed or revised by rule. During the past five months, CDC in consultationwith the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration,has developed the proposed draft materials. We invite comments on the proposalfrom health care providers, parent organizations, and other interestedparties. Section 2126 requires that information contained in the materials be presentedin understandable terms and must include:(1) The frequency, severity, and potential long-term effects of the diseaseto be prevented by the vaccine,(2) The symptoms or reactions to the vaccine which, if they occur, shouldbe brought to the immediate attention of the health care provider,(3) Precautionary measures legal representatives should take to reducethe risk of any major adverse reactions to the vaccine that may occur,(4) Early warning signs or symptoms to which legal representatives shouldbe alert as possible precursors to such major adverse reactions,(5) A description of the manner in which legal representatives should monitorsuch major adverse reactions, including a form on which reactions can berecorded to assist legal representatives in reporting information to appropriateauthorities,(6) A specification of when, how, and to whom legal representatives shouldreport any major adverse reaction,(7) The contraindications to (and bases for delay of) the administrationof the vaccine,(8) An identification of the groups, categories, or characteristics ofpotential recipients of the vaccine who may be at significantly higherrisk of major adverse reaction to the vaccine than the general population,(9) A summary of relevant State and Federal laws concerning the vaccine,including information on_(A) The number of vaccinations required for school attendance and the schedulerecommended for such vaccinations, and(B) The availability of the Program, and(10) such other relevant information as may be determined by the Secretary.The contents of the appended material meets these requirements. It shouldbe noted that numbers (6) and (9) above require input by each State onits (1) respective vaccine laws and regulation requirements, and (2) proceduresfor reporting of adverse reactions, both of which vary considerably fromState to State. Since CDC plans to furnish States with a camera-ready copyof the final materials, current plans are to leave space in appropriateareas of the materials for insertion of the required State information.After inserting State specific information, each State would then printand disseminate sufficient quantities of the materials to public healthclinics and other health care providers for distribution with each doseof vaccine purchased under a consolidated Federal contract. The cost ofprinting and disseminating these information materials would be paid forusing the funds appropriated specifically for patient/parent notificationactivities.Health care providers using privately purchased vaccine will be expectedto pay the printing costs for the vaccine information materials which theymust distribute in accordance with the Act. However, the States would distributesingle camera-ready copies of the materials to these providers to facilitatethe distribution of the information materials with the privately purchasedvaccine. This cost would also be paid for using the funds appropriatedspecifically for patient/parent notification activities.CDC anticipates that the information materials will be presented in printedbooklets to the legal representatives or those about to be immunized. Commentis invited on the format, comprehensibility, and length of materials, andparticularly on the amount of time required for vaccine recipients, ortheir legal representatives, to read the materials before the vaccine canbe administered. In addition, comment is invited on alternative means formeeting these requirements.Future revisions in the information materials would be published as anamendment to this subpart A. CDC proposes to publish technical amendmentsby notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, to be effective immediately. Substantive changeswould be published as a final rule subject to comment.The Secretary has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``major rule''under Executive Order 12291. Thus, a regulatory impact analysis is notrequired because it will not:(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) Impose a major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individualindustries; Federal, State or local government agencies; or geographicregions; or(3) Result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The proposed regulation does not contain information collection requirementswhich would have to be approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder the Paperwork Reduction Act.

The film can make it hard toswallow and breathe, and may cause suffocation.If diphtheria is not treated soon enough, the diphtheria germs make a poisonthat can cause serious problems such as a paralysis and heart failure.About 1 out of every 10 people who get diphtheria dies of it. People whoare sick with diphtheria or those with the diphtheria germ in the noseor throat pass the germ to others, by coughing and sneezing. Only a fewcases of diphtheria have occurred in the United States over the past fewyears. This is because people have been given shots to protect them againstthis terrible disease.What is Tetanus?Tetanus (lockjaw) is a serious disease caused by a poison from the tetanusgerm. It starts with a headache and having trouble opening the mouth andswallowing. Tetanus poison causes painful convulsions (fits, seizures).Tetanus germs can be found just about everywhere; in dirt, dust, and animaldroppings. Tetanus is not passed from one person to another. Tetanus germsget into the body through cuts or scratches, and, if these are not treated,the germs grow and make the poison.Doctors must use powerful drugs and medicines to treat the disease. Tetanuslasts for weeks and those sick with it must stay in a hospital. There areabout 70 cases of tetanus in the U.S. each year. Almost no cases occurin children or young adults. This is because most children and young adultsare protected by shots. Most tetanus occurs in older adults because manyolder adults have not gotten the shots that they need to protect them fromthe disease. In the U.S. tetanus kills 3 out of every 10 people who getthe disease.What is Pertussis?Pertussis (whooping cough) is a disease of the lungs. It is caused by agerm that is easily passed by those sick with the disease to others bycoughing or sneezing. Pertussis causes spells of coughing that make ithard to eat, drink, or breathe. Many children with pertussis get pneumonia(as many as 1 out of every 6 with pertussis). As many as 1 out of every50 children with pertussis may have convulsions (fits, seizures); and asmany as 1 out of every 200 may have brain problems (encephalopathy).In the U.S., 1,000 to 4,000 cases of pertussis are reported each year.Sixty percent of children 6 months to 4 years of age who catch pertussishave received fewer than 3 shots of pertussis vaccine that are recommended(see Pertussis Vaccine on page <T2>XX</T2>). Most cases of pertussis occur in children under 5 years old.This disease is most dangerous for young children, especially babies. Mostbabies with pertussis are so sick that they must go into the hospital.One out of every 100 babies with pertussis may die.Vaccines to Keep People from Getting Sick With Diphtheria, Tetanus, andPertussisThe best way to be protected against getting any of these 3 diseases isto get certain shots (vaccines).<T3>Diphtheria Vaccine </T3>(also called Diphtheria Toxoid)_Provides substances(antitoxins) in the blood that are considered to provide protection inat least 85 percent of people who get 3 or more vaccine shots. After childrenget the first 3 shots, experts believe that 1 or 2 more shots before the7th birthday will provide better and longer lasting protection. Adultsshould get a shot every 10 years after the first 3 shots.<T3>Tetanus Vaccine</T3> (also called Tetanus Toxoid)_As used in the childhoodvaccines, DTP (diphtheris, tetanus, and pertussia) and DT/Td (diphtheriaand tetanus) provides substances (antitoxins) in the blood that are consideredto provide protection in at least 95 percent of people who get 3 or morevaccine shots. Another type of tetanus vaccine (``fluid'') may protectfewer people. After children get the first 3 shots, experts believe that1 or 2 more shots before the 7th birthday will provide better and longerlasting protection. Adults should get a shot every 10 years after the first3 shots.<T3>Pertussis Vaccine_</T3>Protects 75 to 85 percent of children who getat least 3 shots. Because pertussis (whooping cough) is most common andmost serious in babies, the 3 shots are best given in the first 6 monthsof life. Some states require a total of more than 3 shots. Experts believethat 1 or 2 more shots given by the 7th birthday will provide better andlonger lasting protection. Children up to 7 years old should get the vaccine.People 7 years old and older should NOT get pertussis shots.These vaccines are usually mixed together as DTP (diphtheria, tetanus,and pertussis), or DT/Td (diphtheria and tetanus). The usual shots givento babies and children up to 7 years old is DTP. A series of DTP shotsprovides good protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.Some children should delay getting the DTP shots (see When Should a ShotBe Delayed on page <T2>XX</T2>) or should not get the pertussis part of DTP (see When Shoulda Shot Not be Given on page <T2>XX</T2>). Those children who should not get the pertussis part needto get shots known as DT (diphtheria and tetanus) to protect them againstdiphtheria and tetanus (lockjaw) disease.Children 7 years old and all older persons cannot get DTP or DT. Personsin these age groups who need protection against diphtheria and tetanusshould receive shots known as Td (tetanus and diphtheria). The diphtheria(d) part of Td is specially made for older children and adults. The combined(Td) shot is recommended by experts, but some doctors still use a shotwhich has only tetanus vaccine.Problems Caused by Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis VaccinesExperts agree that the benefits of shots against diphtheria, tetanus, andpertussis are much greater than the problems from the shots.andbullet; Diphtheria and Tetanus Vaccine(s) (DT, Td, Tetanus)DT, Td, or tetanus shots cause few problems. They may cause some soreness,swelling, and redness where the shot was given and a little fever.As with any drug or shot, there is a rare chance that a serious problem(serious allergic or nerve problem) or even death could occur. If a seriousproblem occurs, a doctor should be seen as soon as possible. andbullet; Pertussis Vaccine (DTP, PertussisMost children will have a little fever, soreness and redness at the shotsite, and will act cranky (upset) following a DTP or pertussis shot. Thisis usually caused by the pertussis part of the shot.Much less often, a child may have a serious problem following a DTP shot.Some children may have a fever with a temperature of 105 anddegrees;F orhigher (1 in every 330 DTP shots). Some children will cry without stoppingfor 3 hours or longer (1 in every 100 DTP shots). A child may have an oddhigh-sounding cry (1 in every 900 DTP shots). Even less often, a childmay have a convulsion (fit, seizure) (1 in every 1,750 DTP shots) or havean episode of shock-collapse (become blue, pale, limp and not responsive)(1 in every 1,750 DTP shots). Very rarely, a child may have brain damagethat lasts the rest of his or her life (1 in every 340,000 DTP shots).Anyone who has one of these serious problems after a DTP shot should NOTget another pertussis shot but may get the diphtheria and tetanus shots.As with any drug or shot there is a rare chance that other serious problems(serious allergic or nerve problem) or even death could occur. If a seriousproblem occurs, a doctor should be seen as soon as possible. Most of theinformation about the cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) showsthat DTP shots do not cause SIDS.When to Get Vaccine Shots and How Many a Child Should GetExperts recommend that children should get 5 shots of DTP by the time thechild first goes to school. Usually the 1st shot is given when the babyis about 2 months old, the 2nd shot at about 4 months, the 3rd at about6 months, the 4th when the baby is 15 to 18 months, and the 5th shot isgiven when the child is 4 to 6 years old. Those children who should notget DTP (see When Should a Shot Not Be Given on page__) should get DT instead.Children 7 years old and older who never had DTP or DT should get threeshots of Td.When Should a Shot be Delayed?Any of these vaccine shots_andbullet; <T3>Should </T3>be delayed for anyone who is sick with something more seriousthan a common cold, until that person is better or the doctor okays theshot.andbullet; <T3>Should </T3>be delayed for anyone who has ever had a convulsion (fit,seizure) or other problem of the brain or nervous system until fully examinedby a doctor. (see Other Things You Should Know or Do on page__)andbullet; <T3>May </T3>be delayed for anyone taking a special treatment for cancer(x-ray or cancer drugs) or special drugs that make it hard for the bodyto fight infection (prednisone or steroids). A doctor needs to decide whenand which shots to give.When Should a Shot Not Be Given?Children 7 years old and older and all adults should NOT get DTP, pertussis,or DT shots, but they may get Td or tetanus shots.Some shots (vaccines) may cause serious problems in certain people. <T3>If any of the problems listed below occurred after a shot, you shouldtell the person who is going to give the next vaccine shot. </T3>Usually,one of the other vaccine shots (one without the part that may have causedthe problem) can be given. These problems may occur especially after ashot with pertussis vaccine.andbullet; An allergy problem within 24 hours after getting the shot, wherethere was a problem with breathing; swelling in the mouth, throat, or face;or hives (a skin rash).andbullet; A temperature of 105anddegrees;F or higher within 48 hours aftergetting the shot.andbullet; An episode of shock-collapse (becoming blue or pale, limp andnot responsive) within 48 hours after getting the shot.andbullet; Crying for more than 3 hours without being able to stop the cryingby feeding or holding the child, occurring within 48 hours after gettingthe shot.andbullet; A high-sounding cry that is unusual for the child, within 48 hoursafter getting the shot.andbullet; A convulsion (fit, seizure) or other serious problem of the brainor nervous system within 7 days after getting the shot.Other Things You Should Know or Do1. For children who are to get DTP or pertussis shots_The doctor or otherperson who is going to give a shot should be told about a <T3>personal </T3>or <T3>family history </T3>of convulsions (fits, seizures). If the child whois to get a DTP or pertussis shot has ever had a convulsion (fit, seizure)or has a close family member (brother, sister, or parent) who has everhad a convulsion, the chance that this child might have a convulsion aftera DTP or pertussis shot goes up.A doctor should fully examine any child who has had a convulsion and thendecide which shot this child is to get. Because there is still some chanceof getting pertussis and because the chance of a convulsion is very low,ALMOST ALL children who have had a convulsion unrelated to receipt of DTPor pertussis shots and ALL children with a history of convulsion in closefamily members should get DTP or pertussis shots.You should talk with the doctor or other person who is going to give ashot about using medicines or other measures to stop fever from the shots.If a serious problem occurs, a doctor should be seen as soon as possible.2. What are your State laws for these shots? (See State Immunization Requirementson page__)3. Do you have any questions about the diseases and shots after readingor being told about the information in this booklet? You need to ask anyquestions you have! Ask these questions NOW, either of the doctor or ofthe person who is going to give the shot. Only after all questions areanswered to your satisfaction should you decide whether to get the shot.4. You should sign the form below (or a similar one) before receiving ashot. The people who give shots will keep the form that you sign or theywill write in your record or their office record what shot was given, whenthe shot was given, the name of the company that made the vaccine, andthe vaccine's special lot number.<ITAG tagnum="21">I have read or have had explained to me the information in this bookletabout diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough) diseaseand DTP, Pertussis, DT, Td, and Tetanus vaccine shots.

Usually itcauses a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes lasting 1to 2 weeks. Sometimes it is more serious. It causes an ear infection orpneumonia in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who catch it. About 1 outof every 1,000 children who catch measles will have an inflammation ofthe brain (encephalitis).This problem can cause convulsions (fits, seizures), loss of hearing, ormental retardation. About 1 out of every 10,000 children who catch measlesdies from it. Measles can also cause a pregnant woman to lose her babyor have it born too early.People catch measles by breathing in the measles germs. These germs arepassed on to others by people who have measles when they cough, sneeze,or just talk. Measles is so easy to catch that before measles vaccine wasavailable, almost all children caught this disease by the time they were15 years old.Before measles shots were available, there were hundreds of thousands ofmeasles cases and hundreds of deaths caused by measles in the United Statesevery year. Now, wide use of the measles vaccine has almost caused measlesto disappear from the United States. However, if children don't get themeasles vaccine, they have a good chance of catching measles when theyare still children or when they are older, when it might be even more serious.What is Mumps?Mumps is a common disease of children. Most of the time it causes a childwho catches it to have a fever and headaches. It also causes a swellingof the salivary glands in the jaw, which then makes the cheeks swell. Sometimesmumps can be more serious. About 1 out of every 10 persons who catch mumpshas a problem with the coverings of the brain and the spinal cord (meningitis).Even less often, persons with mumps can have a problem (inflammation) ofthe brain itself (encephalitis) which usually goes away without leavinga lifelong problem. Mumps can also cause people to lose their hearing.About 1 out of every 4 teenage boys or adult men who catch mumps gets aswelling of his testicles. Although this is painful, it rarely keeps themfrom being able to father a child.People catch mumps by breathing in the mumps germs. These germs are passedon to others by people who have mumps when they cough, sneeze, or justtalk.Before mumps shots were available, almost all children caught mumps beforethey were grown. Now, because of the wide use of mumps vaccine, there area lot fewer cases. However, if children don't get the mumps vaccine, theyhave a good chance of catching mumps when they are still children or whenthey are older. When teenagers and adults have mumps their illness is usuallymore serious and causes more complications than when children have it.What is Rubella?Rubella, also called German measles, is a common disease of children. But,it can also be caught by adults. Most of the time, rubella is a mild diseasethat causes a low fever, rash, and a swelling of glands in the neck. Thesickness lasts for about 3 days. Sometimes, mostly in adult women, rubellamay cause a swelling and soreness of the joints for a week or two. Veryrarely, rubella can cause a problem (inflammation) of the brain (encephalitis)or cause a problem of bleeding under the skin (purpura) which usually lastsfor only a few days.The worst problem with rubella is when women who are pregnant get thisdisease. As many as one half of these women may lose their babies or havebabies that are born crippled, blind, or with other serious health problems.The last big outbreak of rubella in the United States was in 1964. Thiswas before there was a shot against rubella. Because of that outbreak,about 20,000 babies were born with serious health problems. Many were borndeaf or blind, had heart damage, or had lifelong brain problems. Theseterrible health problems occurred because the mothers of these babies caughtrubella during their pregnancy.Rubella is very easy to catch. People catch rubella by breathing in therubella germs. These germs are passed on to others by people who have rubellawhen they cough, sneeze, or just talk.Before we had rubella shots, there was so much rubella around that mostchildren caught the disease by the time they were 15 years old. Now, becauseof the wide use of rubella vaccine, there are fewer cases of the disease.However, if children don't get the rubella vaccine, they have a very goodchance of catching rubella and maybe even passing it on to a pregnant women.Also, girls could catch it after they grow up and are pregnant themselves.Since rubella is a mild disease, many adult women don't remember if theyhad a case of rubella when they were younger. About 1 out of every 5 womenwho are at an age to have children are still not protected against rubella.Vaccines To Keep People From Getting Sick With Measles, Mumps, and RubellaThe best way to be protected against getting any of these 3 diseases isto get certain shots (vaccines).<T3>Measles Vaccine_</T3>Protects at least 90 out of every 100 people whoget the shot if they are at least 1 year old when they get the vaccine.This protection against measles is probably lifelong. Experts believe measlesvaccine will protect even better if it is given when a child is 15 monthsold or older.<T3>Mumps Vaccine_</T3>Protects at least 90 out of every 100 people whoget the shot if they are at least 1 year old when they get the vaccine.This protection against mumps is probably lifelong.<T3>Rubella Vaccine_</T3>Protects at least 90 out of every 100 people whoget the shot if they are at least 1 year old when they get the vaccine.This protection against rubella is probably lifelong.Only one shot of each of these vaccines is needed to give good protection.These vaccines are usually mixed together as MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella).But they also are available mixed as MR (measles and rubella) and RM (rubellaand mumps), or as separate shots of measles or mumps or rubella.Experts agree that these shots are safe for people who are already protectedagainst measles, mumps, or rubella but who do not know it. Blood teststo measure protection are not necessary before any of the shots are given.Problems Caused by Measles, Mumps, and Rubella VaccinesExperts agree that the benefits of shots against measles, mumps, and rubellaare much greater then the problems from the shots.<ITAG tagnum="81">Local or Mild Problems</ITAG>andbullet; <T3>Measles Vaccine(s) (Measles, MMR, MR). </T3>Measles vaccine, aloneor mixed with rubella or mumps vaccine, will cause about 1 in every 5 childrento have a rash or low fever. This usually begins 1 to 2 weeks after gettinga measles shot and lasts for just a few days.andbullet; <T3>Mumps Vaccine(s) (Mumps, MMR, RM). </T3>Sometimes there will be a littleswelling of the salivary glands. This may happen 1 to 2 weeks afer gettinga mumps shot.andbullet; <T3>Rubella Vaccine(s) (Rubella, MMR, MR, RM). </T3>About 1 in every 7children will have a rash or some swelling in the lymph glands 1 to 2 weeksafter getting a rubella shot. This minor problem usually lasts for a dayor two. About 1 in every 20 children and as many as 4 out of every 10 adultswho get a rubella shot will have some pain and stiffness in the joints.Painful swelling of the joints happens to fewer than 1 out of 50 adultswho get a rubella shot. Problems with joints occur from 1 to 3 weeks aftera rubella shot. They are usually mild and last for only 2 or 3 days andrarely return. Other temporary problems caused by the shot are pain, numbness,or tingling in the hands and feet, but they are uncommon.<ITAG tagnum="81">More Serious Problems</ITAG>andbullet; <T3>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine(s) (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, MMR,MR, RM). </T3>Experts are not sure why, but very rarely, children who getthese vaccines (measles, mumps, and rubella) may have a convulsion(s) (fit,seizure), loss of hearing, or other problem of the brain (encephalitis).As with any drug or shot, there is a rare chance that other serious problems(serious allergic or nerve problems) or even death could occur. If a seriousproblem occurs, a doctor should be seen as soon as possible.When To Get Vaccine Shots and How Many Are NeededExperts recommend that children should get the MMR shot when they are 15months old or older. Anyone who is not known to be protected against measles,mumps, or rubella should receive a shot. It is important that teenagersand adults_especially women who can have babies_who may not be protectedagainst rubella receive a rubella shot. They can get the MMR shot if theymight also not be protected against measles or mumps.When Should a Shot Not Be Given Until You Check With a Doctor?You should tell the person who is going to give the shot if the personwho is going to get the shot:andbullet; Is sick with something more serious than a common cold.andbullet; Has an allergy problem that occurred after eating eggs and wasso serious that it required medical treatment (does not apply to the rubellashot given alone).andbullet; Had an allergy problem that occured after using an antibioticcalled neomycin and was so serious that it required medical treatment.andbullet; Has cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma (cancer of the lymph glands).andbullet; Has any other disease that makes it hard for the body to fightinfection (for example AIDS or HIV infection).andbullet; Is taking special treatment for cancer (X-ray or cancer drugs)or special drugs that make it hard for the body to fight infection (prednisoneor steroids).andbullet; Is pregnant or thinks she may be pregnant.andbullet; Has received a shot of gamma globulin during the past 3 months.Finally, shots should be delayed for anyone who is sick with somethingmore serious than a cold until that person is better or a doctor okaysthe shot.Other Things You Should Know or Do1. For children who are to get the measles shot_If the child who is to get a shot for measles has ever had a convulsion(fit, seizure) or has a close family member (brother, sister, or parent)who has ever had a convulsion, the chance that this child might have aconvulsion after a measles shot is higher. Because there is still somechance of getting measles, and because the chance of a convulsion aftergetting a shot of measles vaccine is very low, all children who have hadconvulsions and all children with a history of convulsions in close familymembers should get a shot against measles.The doctor or other person who is going to give the shot should be toldabout a personal or family history of convulsions. You should talk withthem about using medicines or other measures to stop fever from shots.If a serious problem occurs, a doctor should be seen as soon as possible.2. Measles, mumps, and rubella shots are not known to cause special problemsfor pregnant women or their unborn babies. However, doctors usually donot like to give any drugs or shots to pregnant women unless they haveto. To be safe, pregnant women should not get these shots. Also, a womanwho gets any of these shots should not get pregnant for 3 months followingthe shot.3. If you cannot get these shots because you are pregnant, you should discussthis with the doctor who is caring for your pregnancy. It is very importantfor a pregnant woman to know for sure if she is protected against rubella.4. Giving a shot to a child whose mother is pregnant is not dangerous tothe unborn baby.5.

Most people who have the polio germin their body only have a mild fever, headache, sore throat, or upset stomach.The polio germ lives in the intestines and passes from one person to another,usually by hands dirty with feces, and, rarely, from mouth to mouth.Most people who get crippled by polio will have some weakness in an armor leg for the rest of their lives. Many of these people will be badlycrippled and unable to work.In the United States, thousands of people used to be crippled by polioevery year, and many died. Now, because people get polio vaccine whichgives protection against this terrible disease, polio is very rare in theU.S. But there are still many thousands of polio cases in other parts ofthe world. So we must make sure that our children get all the polio vaccinethey need to protect them if they travel outside the United States andto protect them in case polio germs get into the United States.Vaccines to Keep People From Getting Sick With PolioThe best way to be protected against getting polio is to get at least 3doses of polio vaccine as drops in the mouth (oral [live] polio vaccine-OPV)or as shots (inactivated [killed] polio vaccine-IPV). All healthy babies,children, and young people between the ages of 6 weeks and 18 years needto get at least 3 doses of polio vaccine (OPV drops or IPV shots) to protectthem. Adults who plan to travel to areas of the world where there is polioalso should have had polio vaccine.More than 90 out of every 100 people who get at least 3 doses of OPV dropsor IPV shots are protected against polio. Drops or shots should be givenearly in life. Some states require more than 3 doses of polio vaccine (dropsor shots). Experts believe that 1 more dose of polio vaccine (drops orshot) given by the 7th birthday will provide better protection againstpolio.Experts from government and doctors' groups recommend OPV drops ratherthan IPV shots as the preferred polio vaccine for healthy people up tothe 18th birthday (see When Should OPV Drops Not Be Given? on page <T2>XX</T2>).Although OPV drops and IPV shots are both very good in preventing polio,the OPV is the type of polio vaccine most doctors give to children in theUnited States. The OPV is easier to take, works in the intestines (wherethe polio germs first start to grow), and gives protection for a long time,probably for life.People 18 years old and older who are going to a country where there ispolio should get polio vaccine (see When To Get Vaccine Drops or Shotsand How Many are Needed on page <T2>XX</T2>).Problems Caused by Polio Vaccineandbullet; Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) DropsOPV drops cause few problems. But you should know that very rarely (onetime for every 8 million doses of drops) the drops can cause crippling(paralytic polio) in the person who gets the drops. The chance of paralysisis highest after the 1st dose of drops (one time for every 1 to 2 milliondoses of drops). There is also a very small risk of crippling among peoplewho have close contact with someone who got OPV drops within the previous60 days (one time for every 5 to 6 million doses of drops). Good personalhygiene (hand washing) will make the risk even smaller. Anyone who hasclose contact with a person seriously ill with diseases such as canceror leukemia, or with a person taking medicines (such as steroids or prednisone)that lower that person's resistance to infection should <T3>NOT </T3>get OPV drops.<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Shots</ITAG>Serious illnesses are very rare after IPV shots. IPV shots can cause alittle soreness and redness where the shot was given. As with any drugor shot, there is a rare chance that a serious allergic problem or evendeath could occur. If a serious problem occurs, a doctor should be seenas soon as possible.When To Get Vaccine Drops or Shots and How Many Are NeededEvery child should get 4 doses of polio vaccine (OPV drops or IPV shots)by the time he or she first goes to school. Usually, the 1st dose of OPVor shot of IPV is given when the baby is about 2 months old, the 2nd atabout 4 months, the 3rd when the baby is 15 to 18 months old, and the 4thdose of OPV drops or IPV shot when the child is 4 to 6 years old.Adults who have had some OPV drops before and are going to a country wherethere is polio need at least 1 dose of OPV drops or 1 IPV shot. If theseadults have never had OPV drops or IPV shots, they should get, if thereis enough time, 2 or 3 IPV shots before going. If there is less than onemonth before they leave, they should get at least 1 dose of either OPVor IPV. If they get only one dose of OPV or IPV, it should be given a minimumof 1 to 2 days before they leave.When Should Drops or Shot Be Delayed?<ITAG tagnum="81">Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) Drops</ITAG>Should be delayed for anyone who is sick with something more serious thana common cold, until that person is better or a doctor okays the dose ofOPV drops or a doctor decides the IPV shots should be used instead.<ITAG tagnum="81">Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Shots</ITAG>Should be delayed for anyone who is sick with something more serious thana common cold, until that person is better or the doctor okays the shotof IPV.When Should Polio Vaccine Not Be Given?<ITAG tagnum="81">Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) Drops</ITAG>OPV drops should not be given to anyone who:andbullet; Has cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma (cancer of the lymph glands),or has close contact with such a seriously ill person.andbullet; Has any other disease that makes it hard for the body to fightinfection (for example AIDS or HIV infection).andbullet; Is taking special treatment for cancer (X-ray or cancer drugs)or taking drugs that make it hard for the body to fight infection (prednisoneor steroids), or has close contact with such a person.You should talk to a doctor about <T3>which</T3> polio vaccine should be given.<ITAG tagnum="81">Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Shots</ITAG>IPV shots should not be given to a person who:andbullet; Has a serious allergy problem with certain antibiotics.
