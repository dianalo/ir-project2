Furniture, telephones, adding machines and even typewriters were pretty much standard. The toughest decision usually was whether to buy or lease the photocopier. And if the office of yesteryear was part of a large company that needed and could afford a computer system, experts speaking strange dialects of English handled its purchase, care and feeding.    It's not so simple anymore. Much of what we now call high technology is aimed directly at the workplace and, in particular, at the office. Thousands of vendors and consultants, all preaching the gospel of greater productivity, barrage managers daily with a mind-numbing array of devices that purportedly make work easier and more efficient.    To help office workers communicate better, they offer programmable telephones, fancy facsimile machines, voice mail systems and electronic mail networks. To improve the looks of paper work, they sell word-processing and desktop-publishing systems and laser printers, as well as photocopiers. Then there are the dozens of computer vendors selling everything from personal computers to multimillion-dollar mainframes and the hundreds of software vendors who sell the programs that make the computers useful.    But this variety causes a lot of uncertainty, making it tough for companies to decide what to buy and whom to buy it from.    &quot;It's more than a full-time job&quot; says Larry A. Fisher, manager of information center technology for RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Nabisco unit. He estimates that he and his three-member &quot;technology assessment staff&quot; deal with hundreds of vendors each year in purchasing equipment and software for more than 3,000 Nabisco employees.    Most large corporations have entire departments devoted to assessing new technology for offices and factory floors. Besides testing prospective systems or software packages, they also play detective, checking out the claims and references of vendors.    &quot;We try to be on the leading edge, not on the bleeding edge,&quot; says Roy P. Savage, manager of office and information center systems at Aluminum Co. of America in Pittsburgh. To that end, he says, Alcoa talks to references of a prospective vendor. &quot;And we talk to more than one because you can always count on a vendor to give you their happiest customer as a first reference.&quot;    Few workplace automation experts accuse vendors' representatives of intentionally misrepresenting the capabilities of their products. &quot;I've rarely run into a case where a product doesn't do what is advertised,&quot; says Mr. Fisher. &quot;If vendors misrepresent anything, it's the date that something will be available.&quot;    One criticism of vendors &quot;is that they understate the work and learning and understanding required to get new computers or systems to work the way they are supposed to,&quot; says John J. Connell, president of Office Technology Research Group of Pasadena, Calif., and formerly in charge of Atlantic Richfield Co.'s information systems.    Some contend that isn't necessarily the fault of the vendor. &quot;The problems (with selecting new office technology) aren't so much technological as organizational,&quot; says Roy Amara, president of Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park, Calif., think tank that studies how new technology affects the workplace. &quot;Any new technology itself has real limitations unless it is accompanied by a retraining of people and a restructuring of work flows.&quot; Still, Mr. Amara asserts, &quot;The vendor who doesn't address that part of the problem isn't living up to his responsibility.&quot;    Many office-technology consultants echo Mr. Amara. &quot;The biggest missing element, both in large and small companies, is planning,&quot; says Richard Dalton, founder and contributing editor of Open Systems, a newsletter that covers office technology innovations. &quot;In fact, even though large companies can do a great job of technology assessment, they can still do a lousy job of picking new systems because they don't have a clear view of what they do and need as a business.&quot;    Smaller companies have problems too, but for different reasons. They don't have the advantage of having an in-house technology assessment expert, but they still have to face the same armies of vendors and the same confounding equipment choices. Even so, they aren't necessarily at a disadvantage.    &quot;I think ultimately small businesses can be smarter customers because they don't have all the cash in the world and hence they have to make a good decision,&quot; says Linda O'Keeffe, an office automation analyst for Dataquest Inc., a high-technology market research firm in San Jose, Calif.    But lack of cash also can make small companies more price conscious, consultants say. A big mistake in buying, say, a new computer system could bring down the whole company. That caution often leads to patchwork systems pieced together from many low cost vendors.    &quot;That's a mistake,&quot; says Mr. Savage of Alcoa. &quot;The best thing to do is pick a vendor and drive a stake into the ground. Make what you choose work.&quot; That's what Alcoa is doing, Mr. Savage says, and for a very simple reason. &quot;If you don't limit your number of vendors, you can spend your whole life talking to them.&quot;    ---   Mr. Schlender covers technology from The Wall Street Journal's San Francisco bureau.    ---                Technology in the American Office                      1986 U.S. market data    Equipment                Dollar value     Units Shipped    Copiers                  $14.0 billion    1.1 million    Desktop publishing    (hardware and software)  $276 million     125,900    Electronic typewriters   $917 million     1.2 million    Facsimile                $489 million     187,000    Integrated office    systems                  $301 million     45,000    Laser printers           $1.7 billion     300,000    Personal computers    (includes home market)   $16.8 billion    7.1 million    Software    (sold to business)       $1.4 billion     2.4 million    Voice messaging          $174 million     22,000    Source: Dataquest Inc.    ---                     The Leading PC Vendors    1986 shipments to U.S. business and professional markets     Dollar Value    % Change        Units          %Chg.
