FU</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KAIFENG, China (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In this ancient center of Chinese Judaism,a Jewish-Chinese girl from New York City marked her passage intoadulthood today with a traditional bat mitzvah ceremony.   ``It is so unique for my heritages to be united in one place,''said YiLing Chen-Josephson, 13, the daughter of a Jewish father anda Chinese mother.   Cantor David Lefkowitz incorporated a Chinese folk song into theceremony, held in a hotel because Kaifeng's synogogue was destroyedin the 19th century.   Kaifeng, about 390 miles south of Beijing in Henan province, wasonce home to China's largest Jewish community.   About 40 friends and relatives attended the ceremony, includingthe U.S. ambassador to China, James Lilley, and John Kluge,chairman of Metromedia Co., who is listed by Forbes magazine as therichest man in America.   YiLing's father, Marvin Josephson, is chairman of JosephsonInternational, parent company of International Creative Management,one of the world's largest literary and talent agencies.   He said he thought of holding his daughter's bat mitzvah inKaifeng after reading about a boy whose parents took him to Krakow,Poland, for his bar mitzvah in memory of his grandparents who diedin the Holocaust.   Jewish boys traditionally have bar mitzvahs at age 13 to markreaching adulthood. In modern times, girls also have gone throughthe ceremony, called bat mitzvah.   Today's service originally was planned for last summer, but waspostponed after the army's bloody attack on pro-democracydemonstrators in Beijing. Instead, YiLing had a bat mitzvah in NewYork last November.   But the family did not give up the idea of holding the ceremonyin China, which YiLing's maternal grandparents left more than fourdecades ago. The grandparents returned for the first time for theceremony.   YiLing said last week that coming to China ``helped me torealize how special this is to have ... a combination of two sidesof a family like this.''   ``Before, I just took it for granted that this is what I am,''she said. ``Now, it's beginning to take some meaning.''   Kaifeng was China's capital from the 10th to the 13th centuries,at about the time Jewish traders began arriving by sea and acrossCentral Asia via the Silk Road.   In the early 18th century, several thousand Jews attended theKaifeng synagogue each week. But by the mid-19th century, China'sJews had become largely assimilated, speaking only Chinese andadopting Chinese names and customs.   A 1980 study found only 79 Jewish families totaling 166 membersstill living in Kaifeng, although other accounts say the figure isdouble that.   Through intermarriage, they are virtually indistinguishable fromother Chinese, and most have no knowledge of Judaism or only dimlyremember older generations practicing some Jewish customs.</TEXT></DOC>
