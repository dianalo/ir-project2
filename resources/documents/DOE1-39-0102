Using electrodynamic methods, we conclude here,through the structure of the polarization potential of induced polarizationpotential. The L.E.T. of this detector you can observe the close relationbetween the generalized expression of this L.E.T. in these polymers andone deduced in these papers.</TEXT></DOC>
