Thai border patrol police said more than 50 mortar and artilleryshells fell into Thailand, and Burmese machine-gun fire hit threehouses and a Buddhist temple in the border village of Mae Kone Kane.   Thai police returned the fire, the border patrol said.   Fierce fighting began before dawn as at least 800 governmenttroops attacked the Karen base of Pa Loo, about eight miles south ofthe Thai border town of Mae Sot, said the guerrilla sources oncondition of anonymity.   Burmese troops pounded Pa Loo and the nearby camp at Kaw Moo Rawith hundreds of mortar and artillery rounds, they said. Both campsare separated from Thailand by the Moei River.   No casualties were immediately reported.   With about 8,000 armed fighters, the Karens are the largest of adozen ethnic groups that have fought for more than four decades forgreater autonomy from Rangoon.   Since December, government forces have seized five key guerrillabases.   The guerrillas claim they have killed up to 2,000 Burmese andwounded another 4,000 in the government offensive.   Thai military sources said that up to June 15, about 185 Burmesetroops were killed and at least 470 wounded in attacks on Pa Loo andKaw Moo Ra that began in May. Karen casualties have been light, theysaid, with only six rebels reported dead and another 17 wounded.   In an interview on Sunday at the Karen headquarters of Manerplaw,rebel commmander Bo Mya said that his fighters would revert tobroader guerrilla actions against targets inside Burma following theloss of key border positions.   He dismissed suggestions that the rebels were near defeat, butother Karen officials based along the Thai border said theinsurgency was at its lowest point ever.   Bo Mya blamed recent Burmese successes on the economic boostRangoon received from its trade ties with Thailand. The Karens alsocharged that government forces have been permitted to enter Thailandto attack their positions from the rear.</TEXT></DOC>
