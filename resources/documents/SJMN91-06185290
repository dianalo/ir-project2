A grandconcrete and glass structure or an ugly earthquake trap?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Weekly  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  READERS REACT TO QUAKE-SUSCEPTIBLE CITY HALL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Comment  </MEMO><TEXT>     Here's a representation of how you responded:;  CHANGING WOULD BE WASTE OFTAX DOLLARS; What in the world is wrong with the governing body who we entrustto run the city of Fremont? Is our city so rich in tax or revenue dollars thatwe can afford to throw away $20 million-$30 million or more on moving the cityoffices, tearing down the old one and building a new Police Department? All ofthis is on the presumption that maybe we will have some damage if we have an8.0-plus earthquake. Since when do we allow people who are elected torepresent us base their decisions on maybes and ifs?;    This structure issound, very heavily reinforced and wasn't built 100 years ago. It was designedto withstand earthquakes! It has already been through the 1984 and 1989earthquakes without much damage. What, and who, is to say that it won'twithstand another one or more? Those who speculate that it won't don't knowfor sure.;    As a businessman, property owner, home owner, and heavilyburdened taxpayer in this city and county, I am upset! I see valuable dollarsput into the running of our city and county governments and their comfort,instead of into our educational and athletic programs in our schools. Somehowour city, and many others, has got into the real estate business, instead ofthe welfare of our citizens. I don't hear anyone talking about the possibilityof any business or school buildings that may collapse or have damage, do you?;   I, like many other tax paying and voting citizens, am tired of seeing ourtax dollars wasted.;    The average cost of homes in Fremont is up from the$50,000 range to the $300,000 range in the last 10 years. Plus, we have had atremendous growth in permanent residents and new housing. Where is all themoney going that is generated by this? When you look at the $12 million-$20million the school district wasted on new administrative offices and now ourcity government looking to spend another $20 million-$30 million, it makes youwonder, doesn't it?;    Personally, I think if the City Council votes to spendall this money on speculation, then it will probably be their last &quot;great&quot;decision. It will be time to recall all those who we have entrusted to run ourgovernment, from the mayor on down! Our elected officials need to get theirpriorities straight and do what is best for the majority, not just a few!Isn't that what we elected them for, to represent us, the people?;    --Weldon Birch;  Fremont; Get out before; it's too late; The ultimate dream ofthe original Fremont City Council was to establish a Civic Center on the moundcreated by the forks of the Hayward earthquake fault on the edge of what wasknown at &quot;Stiver's Lagoon&quot; surrounded by a park on the edge of a lake (nowLake Elizabeth) as its center.;    Fremont voters in 1958 defeated a bondissue to buy and build the City Hall on this well-documentedearthquake-shattered area and also changed the city council majority from arestricted growth to pro development. Within one year, the dreamers regainedcontrol of the council and built the first City Hall building on the edge ofStiver's Lagoon on the Hayward Fault. It is now the recreation building onPaseo Padre Parkway and you can see where the active fault line has separatedthe floor at the south end of the building.;    The dreamers flush with theirfirst success entered into an agreement for the current City Hall to be builton the original mound on the Hayward fault lines, thereby avoiding a bondissue.;    The design for the building was chosen by a group of architects whohad been frustrated many times by the Fremont Planning Department changingtheir plans. It has been locally referred to as the &quot;architects revenge.&quot; Ithas won the prize as the ugliest building in Fremont. For years the lightswere left burning at night because there weren't switches to turn them off.The exterior porches allowed the rain and weather to blow into the work area.Finally the porches were enclosed and some of the rough passageways were givena finish coat. At the dedication ceremony it was announced that the buildingwas built to withstand an earthquake of 7 on the Richter scale. A person inattendance said, &quot;shall we all pray for eight?&quot;;    The current city councilmust clean up after the dreamers by abandoning the buildings to stand like avacated castle of yore because of the liabilities therein. If they are stillunder lease each building should be returned to the owners as soon aspossible. It's too bad that the dreamers who built them knowing of the dangerscan't be made to pay the cost of abandon ment. Unfortunately you, thetaxpayers will.;    An earthquake fault is not a straight line, but like acracked windshield, shatters in many directions along the main break. Let'shope the library is not on the fault line.;    -- Rollin Cunningham;  Fremont; BUILD CITY HALL, NOT GOLF COURSE; I think it would be an appropriate andpractical compromise if a new and properly designed city hall is built inplace of that golf course.;    Let the mayors and city council members whoselected and developed the plans and site for the present block-monstrositypay the bill for a new one.;    -- B.
