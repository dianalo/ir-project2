(Editor's Notes)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hildebrand, J.D.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Straddling paradigms While this month's COMPUTER LANGUAGE is nominallydevoted to graphics, it is actually the midpoint of an object-oriented trioof issues.andP;  As I explained last month, we are so captivated by the promise ofobject-oriented programming, so committed to making the technology accessibleto readers, that we have vowed to cover objects and their implications inthree consecutive issues.andP;  Cynics say &quot;object-oriented&quot; is an empty phrase toattract venture capitalists and gullible programmers, but we think realbenefits can be gained via the absorption and adoption of the new paradigm.andM;The marriage of graphics and objects is a felicitous one, as Scott Laddillustrates in this month's cover story, &quot;Beach Blanket Polymorphism.&quot;andP;  I wassorely tempted to promote this as COMPUTER LANGUAGE's First Annual SwimsuitIssue, but in these enlightened final days of the 1980s, the implicit promiseof such a cover blurb transcends audacity to border on foolhardiness.andP;  Ihasten to point out that our sample program generates graphical garb forswimmers of both genders...shame on you for guessing otherwise!andM;Subscriber surveys reveal a predictable conservative streak among COMPUTERLANGUAGE's readers.andP;  While most subscribers evince interest inobject-oriented programming techniques, the language of choice is C++, aparadigm-straddling language that allows but does not require adoption ofobject-oriented programming principles.andP;  Because C++ is a superset of C (but,alas, not ANSI C), it is possible to write and compile old-style proceduralcode with nary a burp from the preprocessor.andM;A paradigm-straddling language like C++ (or either of the new object-extendedPascals, for that matter) is a good short-term choice that helps programmersget up to speed quickly in a new style of programming.andP;  But history shows usthat paradigm straddlers get left behind as serious software developersembrace a new paradigm wholeheartedly.andM;A case in point is professional programming's forgotten stepchild, BASIC.andO;Every time I boot up my copy of Quick-BASIC 4.5, I am impressed anew at thepower of the development environment and the structured-programmingextensions Microsoft has added to the syntax.andP;  Modern BASIC has a flexibleCASE statement, pointers (nearly), expanded support for subprograms anddefinable functions, multiple-line IF...THEN...ELSE...END IF, and a completeset of looping constructs: FOR...NEXT, WHILE...WEND, and DO...LOOP with abewildering variety of UNTIL and WHILE options.andP;  BASIC's performance specsare surprisingly impressive as well, and the immediacy of the QuickBASICdevelopment environment is without peer.andM;BASIC allows but does not require adoption of structured-programmingprinciples.andP;  Like C++, it straddles two generations of thinking about codestructure and design.andP;  C++ could be the BASIC of the 1990s.andM;Before you start the mailstorm of constructive criticism, consider: BASIC hasmade programming accessible to hundreds of thousands of PC programmers.andP;  Itis easily the most popular and prevalent language on PCs.andP;  This is not such abad fate to wish on C++!andP;  We knock BASIC because it is so easy to writeunstructured BASIC code.andP;  We may knock C++ because it is easy to writeprocedural C++ code.andM;BASIC is on my mind because I recently attended a day-long seminar sponsoredby BASIC Symposiums Inc. of Marietta, Ga.andP;  The symposium's keynote addresswas given by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who again made public referenceto &quot;object-oriented BASIC.&quot;andP;  Also known as Visual BASIC, Microsoft's latestbrainchild seems to be planned as a souped-up replacement for DOS'sbatch-file language and as a macro language suitable for user programming ofOS/2 applications -- a common way of manipulating spreadsheets andword-processing documents, for instance.andM;Microsoft does not appear to have plans for adding object-oriented extensionsto its BASIC compilers, but it's hard to say for sure.andP;  Gates did tell aroomful of professional BASIC programmers, &quot;I'm bold enough to say BASIC willoutlive all procedural languages.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, I'm more impressed than ever by Actor, Smalltalk, and Eiffel.andO;These languages bridge no paradigmatic chasms, but they provide advantagesfor developers in complex environments.andM;If I were designing a language from scratch for Windows or PresentationManager applications, I hope it would look a lot like Actor.andP;  The WhitewaterGroup's compiler combines a familiar, C-like syntax with pure object-orientedextensions.andP;  The result may not please theoretical purists (I am reminded,painfully, of a COMPUTER LANGUAGE review of 18 months ago), but it providesreal productivity benefits to Windows programmers, who stand among theneediest.andM;Today's Smalltalk doesn't deserve its reputation as a molasses-slow language.andO;People who haven't used it lately think Smalltalk is still better suited tothe university computer lab than commercial programming environments.andP;  Butthe latest releases from ParcPlace and Digitalk generate production-qualitycode in a seamless, powerful environment.andM;Eiffel is the purest of pure object-oriented languages.andP;  The language'selegance was demonstrated clearly in the sample code generated for WarrenKeuffel's Comparative Language Panel at Software Development '89 lastFebruary.andP;  Eiffel's theoretical grounding is set out explicitly in itsauthor's book, Object-oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall,Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1988).andP;  The sample code from the workshop isavailable on COMPUTER LANGUAGE's CompuServe forum and BBS network.andM;Meet me on the road and we can figure out if C++ is really destined to be theBASIC of the 90s.andP;  You can catch me the week of the Oct. 2 at OOPSLA, theACM's Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Architecturessymposium in New Orleans, La., or Sept. 26-29 in San Francisco, Calif., atthe Embedded Systems Conference (ROMDEX), sponsored by Embedded SystemsProgramming magazine.andM;See you there.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
