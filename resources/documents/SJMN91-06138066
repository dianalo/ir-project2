But it could mean more money for actual research.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LESS OVERHEAD, MORE BELOWLIMITING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS COULD MEANMORE FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR RESEARCH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     It's about time someone cleaned up a system that has been virtuallyunmonitored and rife with abuse. We have only one concern: Budget chiefRichard Darman says the $70 million that would be saved as a result oflimiting administrative costs would be funneled back into pure research,meaning more federal grants for campus scientists.;    That would be good newsfor Stanford researchers, who long have complained that the university's highreimbursement rate hurt their chances for federal grants. But we worry thatthe $70 million simply would be eliminated altogether. That would be badnews.;    With the exception of obvious excesses that have made headlines inrecent months, the bulk of money paid to universities goes toward legitimatecampus expenses. That money should be more carefully monitored, but it shouldnot be diverted.;    The nation's commitment to university research has notchanged. Reforming the reimbursement system should not be seen as anopportunity to weaken that commitment.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910517  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  212  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 17, 199100138066,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
