Our data provide convincing evidence that thelateral refractive index profile arising from junction heating playsa dominant role in determining the lateral emission modes in these devicesfor long-pulse and cw operation. Furthermore, we show that an externalfocused laser heat source can be used to modify the lateral index profilein a broad-area laser and thus control the lasing mode. In particular,we demonstrate that approx. andless;50 mW of absorbed heating power is sufficientto counteract the effects of internal junction heating and restore fundamentalmode operation at cw injection currents as high as 1.5 I/sub threshold/.Our results suggest that fundamental mode operation of broad-area devicesat high-power levels might be realized by incorporating a tailored lateralindex profile to compensate for internal junction heating.</TEXT></DOC>
