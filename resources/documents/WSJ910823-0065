Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, predicts that one result of the coup may be thewithering of the Soviet state -- but not exactly along thelines Marx and Lenin foresaw when they fashioned communism.</LP><TEXT>   What will wither, according to Rep. Aspin and others, willbe the machinery established by the Communists to hardentheir political grip on the nation after their successful1917 coup. They believe that process will begin with themuch-feared KGB internal-security and external-intelligenceforces.   Crowds of reformers in Moscow tore down the statue ofFelix Dzerzhinsky, Lenin's henchman who founded thesecret-police forerunner of the KGB. The Red Army and theparamilitary troops of the Soviet Ministry of Internalaffairs are also likely to fall under the budgetary knives ofSoviet reformers, who received a major injection of power asa result of the coup.   &quot;We will see a tremendous downsizing of the military,&quot;says Phillip Petersen, a former Soviet military analyst forthe Pentagon. He believes that much of the Red Armyeventually will be split into separate militias of the Sovietrepublics that choose to remain part of a looser Sovietconfederation or commonwealth.   The division of the Red Army actually may have begun threemonths ago, when Boris Yeltsin, making a 10-day stump swingin his bid for the presidency of the Russian republic,visited a paratroop base outside of Tula, 100 miles south ofMoscow.   While helicopter gunships, artillery and troops rainedfire down on a distant birch grove in a mock war exercise,Mr. Yeltsin made small talk with some of the juniorcommanders of the elite airborne unit. Evidently he madequite an impression: Some of them brought their troops,joined by parts of the Taman Guards Division, to Mr.Yeltsin's defense Monday. Similarly, troops posted 45 milesoutside Leningrad ignored orders to move against an enormouscrowd in the center of the city.   &quot;The first 10 tanks he {Mr. Yeltsin} got meant that therewas a fight and some hope,&quot; says Phillip Karber, a vicepresident for BDM Corp., which advises the Pentagon on Sovietmilitary matters. &quot;From that moment on, the initiative wasseeping away from the coup.&quot;   Mr. Karber expects much of the Soviet military apparatusto be divided among the republics. &quot;In the short run, that'sgood,&quot; he says. &quot;It will strengthen the republics.&quot; He adds,however, that U.S. planners will have to worry about the longrun and the possibility of chronic civil wars being wagedamong former units of the sprawling Russian empire.   Alexander Alexiev, an analyst of the Soviet military forRand Corp., believes that the Russian Republic will inherit asizable part of the military, including the navy, the armyand the nuclear forces. &quot;The interesting question is whatkind of military power will a democratic Russia be,&quot; he says.&quot;It may be more benign, but it is still going to be a majormilitary power because the Chinese factor is not going todisappear.&quot;   Mr. Petersen expects that the 27,000-warhead Sovietnuclear arsenal eventually will have to be consolidatedwithin the Russian republic, too. The shift, which he sees asthe only way to assure security and control over the weapons,would require the removal of warheads from depots and launchsites in the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Khazakhstan.   Many U.S. experts are troubled over who controlled theSoviet nuclear arsenal during the confusing moments of thecoup.   &quot;One of my worst nightmares was starting to play out,&quot;says Ted Taylor, a former nuclear-weapons designer at theU.S. National Laboratory at Los Alamos, recalling the momentwhen he heard news reports that the eight frustrated plotterswere boarding a plane to leave Moscow. Because theyapparently still had control of the national commandapparatus, Mr. Taylor imagined them heading to some remotebastion where they could threaten nuclear blackmail, orworse. &quot;I think that was a very, very dangerous time,&quot; hesays.   According to Mr. Aspin, the coup will give more impetus tothe move in the U.S. Congress to develop some form of defenseagainst accidental or isolated launching of ballisticmissiles aimed at the U.S. But otherwise, he says, the riseof the reformers in Moscow could accelerate the drive to trimU.S. defense budgets. Because the reformers agree with manyU.S. foreign-policy goals, he adds, they also could providemore cooperation in such trouble spots as the Middle East.The coup, according to Mr. Aspin, &quot;will be a big jumpstart tothe whole reform agenda.&quot;   A drastic reduction of the vast Soviet police-stateapparatus -- especially the KGB, which hasexternal-intelligence functions -- also could result incorresponding cuts in the Central Intelligence Agency'sbudget. But some critics have pointed to the failure ofWestern intelligence to predict the sudden Soviet coup, eventhough there were many hints it was coming.   &quot;There was a long preparatory period to this coup,&quot;believes John Erickson, a Soviet military analyst atScotland's University of Edinburgh. One preparatory run, hebelieves, was a mysterious alert that sent more than adivision of airborne troops rushing into Moscow last Sept. 9,as most of the rest of the world focused on the crisis in thePersian Gulf.   At the time, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov, one ofthe plotters, assured the public: &quot;No one is preparingparatroopers for actions against the people.&quot; He called it a&quot;routine&quot; exercise.   Mr. Erickson recalls a similar operation being carried outin Leningrad, where combined units of the Red Army, the KGBand the MVD -- or Ministry of Internal Affairs -- moved in,supposedly to secure a nuclear-power plant against imaginaryterrorists. Such exercises, he says, were &quot;maskirovka,&quot;deceptive tricks used to hide major military preparationsthat are part of the Red Army's doctrine.</TEXT></DOC>
