Presents procedures that have been used successfullyto design more than 1,200 columns within the last six years. These towershave diameters as large as 46 feet and develop as many as 128 theoreticalstages. Covers new types of packing shapes along with a description ofnew applications for packed towers, such as high-vacuum distillationand high-pressure fractionation.</TEXT></DOC>
