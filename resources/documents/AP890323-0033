The treaty, immediately signed by 34 countries after its approvalWednesday, requires signatories to provide detailed information onintended toxic shipments and to ensure that importing nations canhandle them in an ``environmentally sound'' way.   Signers of the convention also pledge to forbid the shipment ofhazardous wastes to countries that have banned their import.   Waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be keptto a minimum, and developing countries are promised technical aid.   Backers say the treaty is the first step toward restrictingshipments of dangerous waste to nations unequipped to deal with it.But environmentalists contend it would merely legalize the transportof such materials.   The treaty was adopted by delegates of 105 countries after athree-day U.N.-sponsored conference and 18 months of hardbargaining. It intends to confront growing international wastetraffic and fears about poor countries accepting shipments inexchange for lucrative payments.   Twenty countries must formally ratify it before it can go intoforce. U.N. officials have said this could take up to two years.   The United States, Britain and West Germany were among majorindustrialized countries not signing immediately. Delegates weretaking the text back for consideration by their governments.   Among the countries that signed on Wednesday were Canada, France,Italy and host Switzerland. Hungary was the only Soviet bloc countryto sign.   None of the 40 African delegations signed the convention.   Mostafa Tolba, chief of the sponsoring U.N. Environment Program,said African lands are committed to the treaty and he expects theirsignatures after a policy-setting summit meeting in June of theOrganization of African Unity.   Most waste traffic is between industrialized countries. But Tolbawarned that movements between developing countries were on the vergeof becoming a problem which ``God knows how we are going to control.   ``Our agreement has not halted commerce in poison,'' Tolba saidin prepared remarks. ``But it has signaled the international resolveto eliminate the menace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of ourshared environment and to the health of all the world's peoples.''   He urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly.   The Greenpeace environmental group said the text merely legalizesthe international waste trade and was weakened to pleaseindustrialized countries. It again called for a complete ban oncross-border dangerous shipments.   A total of 42 countries, more than half of them in Africa, havebanned waste imports, Greenpeace said.   The convention does not explicitly cover shipments through amember's territorial waters, a point demanded earlier by manycoastal states.   Another contentious issue, liability for damage from wastes, wasput off for further talks.U.S. delegate Philip Winn said Washingtonwould oppose such talks.   Under the treaty, individual nations can sign separate wastetrade treaties with non-signers but they must offer at least as muchenvironmental protection as the U.N. provisions.   Final approval became possible after negotiators compromisedTuesday over Third World demands for tougher language, includinggreater responsibilities for waste-exporting countries and tightercompliance provisions.   Among 16 Third World countries signing immediately wereAfghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Haiti, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico,Panama, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.   The problem was highlighted last year when tons of toxic wasteshipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in Africannations and when waste-laden ships traveled from port to portseeking permission to unload.</TEXT></DOC>
