Supporters of the initiative saythat would raise at least $1.7 million -- putting the property, part of whichis up for sale, within striking distance for the city.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  VOTE NEEDED TO BID FOR ROCKY SHORES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The property is not just another piece of land. It is 5.5 acres zoned forresidential development on a coastline that in parts makes the famous 17-MileDrive next door pale by comparison. Located next to the Point Pinos LighthouseReservation and a mile north of Asilomar Conference Center, Rocky Shoresincludes spectacular views, wild, rock-strewed shores and sandy coves.;    Butcity attempts to buy it for preservation as open space have been foiled by thecomplexities of ownership. The land was offered by its longtime owner twoyears ago, but the city failed to come up with the funds. So owner G. BayleyDorris Jr. sold the seven lots to three owners, some of whom have been playinghardball with the city over the fate of the property ever since.;    They havefiled for building permits, and one owner -- Dallas businessman Steven Page --says he'll build on his lot as soon as he can. Because the land is zoned forresidential development, the city is powerless to prevent building on theproperty, short of buying the land, city officials say. A house on theproperty dating to the 1940s is the only structure west of the winding roadthat goes along the Pacific Grove shoreline.;    The Monterey PeninsulaRegional Park District has pledged $2 million toward the purchase of the land,the Asilomar Operating Corp. donated $400,000, and the state CoastalConservancy authored a grant of $200,000. The result of those additional fundsand of months of haggling is that the agencies have an option to buy four ofthe lots, but are $400,000 short of doing so. The other lots are not forsale.;    &quot;It's a world-class environmental resource,&quot; said Bud Nunn, thePacific Grove councilman who authored the initiative. &quot;People come from allover the world to enjoy that shoreline. It would be unadulterated if itweren't for that one house, and preserved forever if it weren't for our fearabout any more building going on there.&quot;;    Nunn's initiative has the supportof four other members of the seven-member city council, who say the city hasan obligation to do all it can to prevent development on the land. ButCouncilwoman Susan Whitman argues that even if the money is raised, the cityhas no promises that the owners will sell the three lots that aren't forsale.;    &quot;I think the right way to do it is to find the money so that whenthey do come up for sale, we'll be right there,&quot; Nunn said. &quot;I just try tokeep my focus on the fact that if we don't have the money, we can't doanything.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ESTHER SCHRADER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911029  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  567  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 29, 199100303204,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
