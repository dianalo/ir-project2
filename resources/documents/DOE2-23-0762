Arterial segments were perfusedwith whole citrated blood. A stenosis was created by applying an externalplastic constrictor to the artery. Platelet accumulation within the stenosiswas assessed by scanning electron microscopy and by radioactive countsfrom Indium-111 labeled platelets. Utilizing this preparation, 30 carotidarterial segments from 10 mongrel dogs were perfused at 100 mmHg for15 min. In 10 arteries without a stenosis, scanning electron microscopyand radioactive counts demonstrated little platelet accumulation. Incontrast, extensive platelet aggregation was observed in 10 arterieswith stenoses. Moreover, in 10 stenotic arteries exposed to the thromboxanemimetic, U46619 (Upjohn Diagnostic Group), scanning electron microscopyand radioactive counts demonstrated a significant increase in plateletdeposition. Conversely, we demonstrated a dimunition of platelet accumulationin stenosed arterial segments exposed to the prostacyclin analogue plateletinhibitor, Iloprost. The in vitro preparation allows precise controlof hemodynamic variables and makes it possible to perform multiple testson segments of the same vessel from the same animal.</TEXT></DOC>
