This year, only one of seven top Afghan guerrilla leaders basedin Pakistan spoke at what may be the last such rally after a decadeof war.   The rally coincided with increased Soviet diplomatic efforts fora political settlement of the conflict.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the most radical rebel chief, addressed therally at a big refugee camp on the outskirts of Peshawar, 30 milesfrom the Afghan border. The anti-Marxist rebels have demonstratedeach year on Dec. 27, the date in 1979 that the Red Army marchedinto Afghanistan at the invitation of the communist government inKabul.   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in Pakistan and upto 2 million in Iran.   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party Afghan guerrillaalliance supported by Washington and based in Pakistan, met Tuesdayin the Iranian capital Tehran with government officials and Afghanrebels.   The guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, are splitinto two coalitions _ the Iran-based Shiite Moslem alliance andRabbani's larger Sunni Moslem alliance based in Pakistan.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted theEnglish-language newspaper Tehran Times on Tuesday as reporting thatSoviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov will fly to Tehransoon to meet Shiite resistance leaders. It will be the first directcontact between Moscow and the Iran-based mujahedeen since the 1979Soviet intervention.   Rabbani was in Iran to ensure that both coalitions present aunited front to Moscow.   Also Tuesday, Radio Kabul said in a broadcast monitored inPakistan that guerrilla rocket attacks on Afghan cities over theprevious two days killed at least 28 people. The state-run radiosaid Herat in western Afghanistan was hardest hit with 20 peoplekilled, four injured. There was no independent confirmation.   At the Pakistan rally, Hekmatyar directed his rhetoric at hisAmerican backers as well as the Soviet Union. Though Pakistani andWestern sources say he is one of the largest recipients of U.S.military aid to Afghan rebels, Hekmatyar refused to acknowledgemilitary assistance from Washington.   He said his weapons were captured in battle, a contention otherguerrilla leaders deny.   The hardliner also declared, ``It seems that Moscow is reachingan understanding with the West on one hand in a bid to prevent amujahedeen government in Afghanistan.''   His speech was punctuated with audience shouts of ``Death toRussia!'' and ``Death to America!''   Many demonstrators belonged to Hekmatyar's fundamentalistHezb-e-Islami group. A sprinkling of representatives from othermujahedeen groups attended.   In April, Moscow agreed to pull more than 100,000 soldiers fromAfghanistan by Feb. 15 next year. Half of them left by August. TheUnited Nations negotiated the agreement in Geneva and it was signedby Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates acting as co-guarantors.   The mujahedeen were not party to the accords, and the Sovietssuspended their withdrawal in the face of continuing rebel attacks.   At the beginning of December, Vorontsov met Rabbani in Taif,Saudi Arabia, for negotiations.   Rabbani said earlier that Vorontsov hinted that Afghanistan'sMarxist President Najib, who goes by one name only, and his People'sDemocratic Party would be sacrificed for a political settlement ofthe war.   Hekmatyar has greeted the talks with skepticism. He said Tuesday,``Although these talks are a great political victory for themujahedeen, great hopes should not be pinned on such talks.''   He assailed a Saturday meeting between Vorontsov and former KingZahir Shah of Afghanistan, who has lived in exile in Rome since hewas ousted in a 1973 coup.   Moderate Afghan rebel groups have supported the king's return tohead an interim government, to be replaced in time by an electedParliament.   Hekmatyar also dismissed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev'scall for an international conference on Afghanistan, a cease-fireand U.N. peacekeeping troops. The mujahedeen unanimously oppose theconference because it would include representation from Kabul.   Rabbani said Tuesday that no differences of opinion exist betweenthe two mujahedeen alliances, Tehran television said in a reportmonitored in Cyprus.   ``All the mujahedeen groups agree on a complete Soviet troopwithdrawal and the establishment of an Islamic government inKabul,'' the television quoted him as saying.   Afghan refugees demonstrated in several Iranian cities to markthe anniversary.   In London on Tuesday, Soviet Embassy officials met for the firsttime in Britain with representatives of two anti-communist Afghangroups.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe meanwhile called onthe Kabul regime to step down as soon as possible to avoid morebloodshed.</TEXT></DOC>
