Production is from the Permian-age Grayburg Formation, a thicksequence of anhydritic dolostones and siltstones. These sediments haveundergone a complex history of sedimentation and diagenesis that ultimatelycontrolled the relative productivity of the reservoir. The structureof the reservoir in McElroy Field is a north-south trending asymmetricalanticline with a steep east flank and a gently-dipping west flank. Astratigraphic permeability barrier defines the western boundary of thefield, whereas the eastern edge of the reservoir is limited by a gradualreduction of permeability coupled with an increase in water saturation.Wells in McElroy Field range in depth from 3,000 to 4,100 ft and producefrom a gross section that averages 275 ft in thickness. Discovery ofthe field in 1926 has been followed by continuous development that nowincludes more than 1800 wells. Secondary recovery processing of the reservoirbegan in 1960. Current plans include large-scale alteration of the water-floodingprogram as well as polymer and pilot CO/sub 2/-injection projects.</TEXT></DOC>
