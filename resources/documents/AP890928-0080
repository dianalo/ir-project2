ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the Democratic Party,describing President Bush as offering the nation timid leadership,called on the Republican president today to begin ``matching hisactions to his charming words.''   ``It would be wonderful to have an American president seize thistime of change and begin leading the world again,'' Ronald H. Browntold a meeting of the Democratic National Committee.   The party chairman's speech reflected his earlier statementsthat it was time to ``start taking on George Bush,'' and itreceived an enthusiastic response from his partisan audience.   ``Are we going to go forward with a public spirit, a commitmentto doing what it takes at every level of American society usingevery American political institution?'' asked Brown. ``Or are wegoing to continue the ethic of greed, humming the lemming-likemelody _ don't worry, be happy?''   Brown attacked the Bush anti-drug program as ``big wordsfollowed by limited action. ... They declared war and decidedsomebody else is going to have to find the bullets.''   The Democratic chairman said the first thing the president waswilling to fight for was a cut in the capital gains tax a``massive, needless tax break to the wealthiest one percent _ agiveaway that will cost working Americans billions.''   ``When it comes down to risking his polling numbers, when itcomes to leading America rather than timidly following theprevailing winds, George Bush hasn't come through,'' said Brown.``Let's be clear _ for our country which we love, for our people,and as a party, we hope President Bush changes his course andbegins matching his actions to his charming words.''   The nearly 400 members of the DNC also were ready to roll backpart of a party rules compromise reached at Atlanta in 1988. TheDNC members also were set to require that they have a voice whenany such deals are cut in the future.   As part of its attempt to become more aggressive, the DNC beganairing a 30-second advertisement on Cable News Network thatattacked Bush's proposal to cut taxes on capital gains.   The ad featured House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,saying, ``George Bush wants to raid the Treasury by reducingcapital gains taxes for the super-rich. And he wants you to pay forit.''   The House is debating the tax plan and some Democrats aresupporting the president.   The DNC members were poised to restore their status as automaticunpledged delegates to national conventions, a role they lost inthe compromise reached between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson atthe Atlanta convention in 1988.   Brown was the principal negotiator for Jackson at thatconvention, but supported negating that part of the compromise.   Remaining intact was the decision to drop the requirement thatcandidates in presidential primaries and caucuses must receive atleast 15 percent of the vote to be awarded delegates.   The so-called 15 percent threshold was dropped at the insistenceof Jackson. But party officials at the DNC meeting were freelypredicting it will be restored for the 1992 convention.   ``It can be done any time,'' said James Ruvolo, the OhioDemocratic Party chairman who is president of the Association ofState Democratic Chairs.   ``I think you'll find support (for restoring the threshold) froma lot of quarters,'' said Ruvolo.   In another look ahead to 1992, the Democrats were getting anearly start on choosing the site for their next nominatingconvention. The list already has been narrowed to eight cities _New York, Houston, Detroit, Cleveland-Brook Park, Seattle, NewOrleans, Miami Beach and Atlanta.   The Democrats met in Atlanta in 1988, while the Republicanconvention was in New Orleans.   Several major cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco,Dallas and Chicago, told the Democrats they wouldn't bid for the1992 convention. Most cited the requirement that the party haveunlimited access to the convention hall for three months prior tothe convention. The city of Dallas told the Democrats thatrequirement would force the city to cancel nine major trade shows.</TEXT></DOC>
