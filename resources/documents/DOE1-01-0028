Most ion stability studies have focused onshort-term chemical changes that occur in precipitation samples. Thetime scale involved in these studies has varied from hours to six weeksafter collection. The long-term stability of ions in solutions is anarea of interest that is important if archived samples are ever usedfor purposes other than their original intent. An example of this instancewould include the measurement of trace metals in archived wet depositionsamples that were originally collected only for major ion determinations.2 refs., 9 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
