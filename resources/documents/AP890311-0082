(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Discovery's cargo bayholds a $100 million satellite whose deployment will complete anorbiting communications network and enable NASA to shut six groundstations at a savings of $3 million a month.   The astronauts' release of the 2{-ton Tracking and Data RelaySatellite into its own orbit 22,300 miles up is the main goal of the28th space shuttle mission scheduled for liftoff here Monday morning.   The first TDRS was launched from Challenger in 1983, andChallenger was carrying a second one that was destroyed along withthe seven-person crew in the disaster of Jan. 28, 1986.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration considers theTDRS system so vital to space communications that TDRS satelliteswere assigned to two of the first three shuttle missions after theChallenger explosion.   On the first of those missions, Discovery's crew successfullylaunched a TDRS last September. If the third satellite issuccessfully launched Monday on the third post-Challenger flight,the system will be complete, with the two newest satellites in useand the oldest one serving as a spare.   Liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday for a five-day mission, withfive astronauts on board. Discovery's countdown was put on hold forseven hours Saturday morning because high winds on Friday had slowedlaunch preparations, but NASA said the delay should not affect thelaunch.   Under the current system, 14 ground stations are stationed aroundthe globe, and the shuttle communicates with Earth by beamingmessages down to whatever station is closest, which then relays theinformation to mission control. Because the stations are so widelyspaced, astronauts aboard the shuttle can't radio Earth at all for85 percent of the time.   With the TDRS system, the shuttle will be out of radio contactwith mission control just 15 percent of the time and it will be ableto transmit much more data. Instead of radioing down to a groundstation, the shuttle will send and receive its messages bytransmitting upward to the TDRS satellites, one high over theAtlantic and the other high above the Pacific.   Because the TDRS satellites are positioned much farther away fromEarth than the shuttle in orbit, they have the vantage points thatwill allow the shuttle to maintain radio contact with a singleground station on Earth almost all the time.   The TDRS also will improve communications with other satellites,including some military satellites.   With its seven antennas, a TDRS satellite can transmit to theground station at White Sands, N.M., the equivalent of a 20-volumeencyclopedia in one second.   Scheduled for closing are stations at Ascension Island in theSouth Atlantic; Santiago, Chile; Guam; Kauai, Hawaii; Dakar,Senegal; and Yarragadee, Australia. They employ a total of nearly400 people, and most stations date back to Mercury, America's firstman-in-space program, in the early 1960s.   Three of the stations, at Madrid, Spain; Canberra, Australia; andGoldstone, Calif., will not be closed but will be used by a spaceproject managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.   The other five stations will provide tracking data as a shuttleis launched or is landing. They are at Merritt Island and Ponce deLeon in Florida; Bermuda; Wallops Island, Va.; and Dryden FlightResearch Facility, Calif.   Charles Hunter, TDRS project manager for NASA's Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Maryland, said the closings will save NASA ``about$3 million a month, once we get operational.''   Astronauts Robert Springer and James Bagian are to release thesatellite from Discovery's cargo bay 6 hours 13 minutes after launchat an altitude of 184 miles.   An attached rocket stage is to ignite and boost the satellite toa stationary orbit 22,300 miles up. A series of ground-controlledmaneuvers over several weeks will shift it to its permanent outposthigh above the Pacific near South America.   TRW Space andamp; Technology Group builds the TDRS satellites forCONTEL, which leases them to NASA.</TEXT></DOC>
