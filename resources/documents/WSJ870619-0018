Allegis said it named Stephen E. Tallent, senior partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher, as its new labor counsel. It said Mr. Tallent, who worked in the firm's Washington office, will report directly to the company's new chairman and chief executive officer, Frank A. Olsen.    Mr. Tallent, who will begin his new job immediately, is being thrust into the center of Allegis's most vexing problem: how to restore labor peace at the company and resolve various proposals by employee groups who want to own part or all of the company.    Mr. Tallent succeeds David Pringle, the airline's chief labor negotiator, who resigned yesterday. Mr. Pringle was reassigned last week in a major management shake-up, which included the resignation of Allegis's chairman and chief executive officer, Richard J. Ferris.    Mr. Tallent, who has specialized in equal employment opportunity cases, said he will represent the company in contract negotiations, advise management on proposals for employee ownership, and generally attempt to curb labor unrest.    His appointment drew immediate criticism from officials at the airline's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists, who called Mr. Tallent's law firm &quot;anti-union.&quot;    Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher, based in Los Angeles, represented Western Airlines and Delta Air Lines in their attempt to void Western's contracts with its unions after the two airlines merged earlier this year. Mr. Tallent wasn't directly involved in that case, but he has represented management in several other labor cases.    &quot;Steve Tallent is a management lawyer, no ifs, ands or buts about it,&quot; said Los Angeles labor attorney Jay Roth, who represented one of the labor organizations in the Western case.    John Peterpaul, a vice president of the machinists union, said he feared a change in negotiators would impede the union's current contract talks. &quot;We've been negotiating for six months. This is a sorry state of affairs,&quot; Mr. Peterpaul said.    An officer of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association said the union wasn't familiar with Mr. Tallent or his firm and that it has received &quot;no information from the company on a direct basis about this matter.&quot;    Mr. Tallent, 49 years old, comes to the company at a time of when tension between labor and management is high and employee groups are at odds with each other.    A bitter monthlong strike by United's pilots in 1985 led their union to launch a takeover bid for the airline in April. Just two weeks ago, the machinists union threatened to strike over its contract negotiations and its concerns about a management-proposed restructuring plan that would have added significantly to the company's debt.    The resulting turmoil was partly responsible for the resignation last week of Mr. Ferris, Allegis's chairman and chief executive, and for the decision by its directors to sell the company's hotel and rental-car units and refocus on the airline.    Now, the employee groups are fighting with each other over various proposals that would give them an ownership stake in the airline. The pilots union says it still wants to own the airline, while the machinists union says it is opposed to majority ownership by any employee group. The machinists have proposed a 20% to 30% ownership stake for employees.    An anti-union group of pilots, meanwhile, told Allegis's new chairman Wednesday that they believe employees should have no more than a 50% interest in the company.    Mr. Tallent, who has represented management at such companies as Rockwell International Corp., United Parcel Service and United Technologies Corp., said he believes United, which has among the highest labor costs in the industry, &quot;clearly needs to become more competitive.&quot; But he said he didn't know whether he would be asked to seek work and salary concessions from the airline's unions.
