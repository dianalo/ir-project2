Forbeams of /sup 40/Ar and /sup 56/Fe altogether more than 33600 interactionsof beam nuclei and about 15600 interactions of fragments produced innuclear collisions were analyzed. Besides interactions with the lighttarget nuclei H, C and O of the plastic detectors, interactions withsilver target nuclei were also studied. For this purpose silver foilswere stacked between the plastic detector foils. Cross sections for theproduction of fragments with Z{ge}8 from nuclei with 9{le}Z{le}26 incharge changing nuclear collisions were determined.</TEXT></DOC>
