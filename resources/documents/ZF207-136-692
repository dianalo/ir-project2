(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>TWO SEPARATE WORLDS MOVING SLOWLY CLOSERandM;The headline read, &quot;It's Late, Costly, Incompetent--But Try Firing a ComputerSystem&quot; [Business Week 11/7/88].andM;The horror story told of numerous incidents of runaway software developmentprojects, which all but destroved the budgets, reputations and evencompetitive capabilities of the companies involved.andM;Among the examples was a project by Allstate Insurance, which would havetotally automated company activities.andP;  The project was initiated in 1982,with a targeted completion of 1987 and a budget of $8 million.andP;  Today theestimated completion is 1993 and estimated cost is $100 million.andM;The city of Richmond, Va., is another example.andP;  In 1984 it signed a $1.2million contract for the installation of a billing and information system.andO;Work was scheduled to end in March 1987.andM;In 1988, after paying close to $1 million, the city cancelled the contract,asserting the system was not delivered.andP;  The contractor, Arthur Young, is nowsuing the city for breach of contract.andM;Additional examples within the Business Week article described projectstaking twice as long as estimated and costs running up to eight times overprojections.andP;  Furthermore, in several cases, the ability of the affectedcompanies to execute their respective business strategies was significantlyhampered.andM;Most experts agree that missed schedules and budgets cannot be fully blamedon poor project control or system design.andP;  &quot;My view is that many projects arein trouble before they get off the ground,&quot; says Victor Riden, the Atlantaconsulting manager for Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.andP;  He finds fault in managementfor its process of approving projects.andM;Fred Forman, vice president at American Management Systems, Arlington, Va.,andO;agrees that lack of project control may contribute to schedule delays andcost overruns.andP;  But, he says, a poor estimate or the lack of a properdetailed plan or list of deliverables are the more likely causes for delays.andM;&quot;Let's be frank,&quot; says Forman, &quot;an overrun of 1,000% doesn't come as asurprise.andP;  Somebody made the decision to proceed in spite of the high costs,and it is ulikely that better precision in the estimates would have stoppedsuch as calamity.andP;  Somebody was afraid to admit the obvious.&quot;andM;These faults do not only occur in the software development industry--the samemaladies also occur in power generation, telecommunications, engineering, andresearch and development.andP;  Here, too, the projects are often doomed tofailure before they start because of a mandated an unrealistic schedule,budget limits and poorly defined end results.andM;We can add two more items to this list of causes of runaway softwaredevelopment projects: sponsorship and staffing.andP;  Every project has a sponsor.andO;Yet, the sponsor frequently does not participate in both the planning andcontrol phases of the project.andM;Inadequate staffing is a fact in most projects.andP;  Part of the problems is adirect result of inadequate funding and imposed personnel ceilings, butinadequate staffing is also caused by putting the wrong people on the job.andO;When time and work-hour estimates are developed, the estimator assumes thatthe best personnel will execute the work.andP;  But when the project isimplemented, people are often committed to other projects.andM;Resources managers are measured as much on their ability to maintain highapplied time standards as they are measured on technical and scheduleobjectives.andP;  And, certainly, the applied (or billable) time numbers areeasier to measure than the others.andP;  Therefore, projects are often staffedwith available people, rather than the right people.andM;It would be wrong to suggest that the application of project managementsoftware tools to software development projects would be a panacea.andP;  In fact,the application of project management software tools might not only be oflimited benefit, but can ever exacerbate an already bad situation byproviding a false sense of security.andM;Nevertheless, without disregarding the preceding caveat, the fact is the useof project management software can be a powerful aid in managing softwaredevelopment projects.andM;The application of project management techniques and software tools to theplanning phase of software development project reaps the greatest benefits incontrolling runaway projects.andM;Just a few years ago, if anyone suggested that project management softwaresystems be usd to help generate such plans, they would have been laughed outof the room.andP;  &quot;In those days,&quot; relates John Gioia, president, Robbins-Gioia,Inc., Alexandria, Va., &quot;software development was considered to be some kindof art form and not suitable for traditional management techniques.&quot;andM;Gioia tells of the time that he asked a developer, &quot;When will you finish?&quot;andO;and got the reply, &quot;How long does it takes to catch a fish?&quot;andM;Gioia reflects, &quot;During the past five years, management, in general, hasrejected the open environment concept, and more and more control is beingimposed on the software development function.&quot;andM;Some of this change is in the use of estimating and computer-aide softwareengineering (Case) tools by the developer.andP;  A major concern is that withoutimproved planning, the use of traditional project control systems will resultin the tracking and recording of problems, rather than their evasion.andP;  Gioianotes tht such efforts &quot;provide more damage assessment than risk avoidancesupport.&quot;andM;He also states that &quot;as the software development environment changes to allowprogram control functions to operate efficiently, there will be a directcorrelation between the use of the function and reduced calamities occurringto software programs.&quot;andM;Gioia offers the following list of attributes that program control providesto the software development process.andM;1.andP;  Risk reduction in planningandM;2.andP;  Management acceptanceandM;3.andP;  Early regression (performance) analysisandM;4.andP;  Controlling the developers activitiesandM;5.andP;  Configuration control of modulesandM;One essential element of change control is the ability to evaluate the effectof any proposed or mandated change on schedules, resources and costs.andP;  Forthis aspect of change control, there can be no argument against the benefitsof a good program control system in helping to analyze alternatives.andM;But how many of these changes are really necessary?andM;&quot;In software development, coding can always be better,&quot; says JohnBaumgartner, director, eastern region for Tandamp;B Computing, Ann Arbor, Mich.andO;&quot;Programmers love to see how much better they can do it, at a cost of nevergetting done.andP;  We must know when 'good is good enough.'andP;  It is up to theprogram manager to keep to the specification.andP;  If it works then it is OK.&quot;andM;RESOURCES PLAN NEEDEDandM;Aerospace software developer, Robert Sievert, of Ball Aerospace, SpaceSystems Division, Boulder, Colo., notes the importance of resource planningas opposed to critical-path scheduling in software development projects.andM;But he downplays the importance of resource leveling.andP;  &quot;Resource leveling isoverrated, or at least extensively misunderstood.andP;  Resource leveling makesgross level assumptions as to the use rates of individual activities.&quot;andO;Moreover, the results require too much analysis, he said.andM;Sievert also joined in the call for comprehensive export facilities ordatabase management capabilities so that users can design their own specialextensions.andP;  An example of such a capability would be adding a bill-backfeature to the system.andP;  User-defined chargeback accounting is one of thefeatures built into Multitrak, from Multitrak Software Development Corp.,andO;Boston.andM;Forman feels spreadsheets are most appropriate for tracking the costs of aproject.andP;  Programs should ideally support import and export, especially ifdirectly to .WK1 and .DBF formats (such as Primavera and Project Scheduler4).andM;Arthur Andersen's Riden emphasized the usefulness of 'what-if' analysis.andO;Managers need to be able to judge the alternatives created through resourcereassignment and prioritizing tasks.andP;  Good project managers understand thatsunk costs should not be considered in the equation.andM;A multiproject capability, with resource availabilities and assignment acrossprojects, is considered a must by virtually all software developers.andM;Resources must be able to be assigned as an amount per task, an amount pertime unit per task and as a percentage of an individual's availability.andP;  Thatis, on any given task, the assignment might be a) a total of 120 hours, b) ata rate of four hours per day over the task duration, or c) at a rate of 50%of that person's remaining availability, after blocking out time forholidays, vacation, baseload maintenance work or priority commitments.andM;This type of multiproject, discrete loading of individual resources isindicative of some of the special needs in software development projectmanagement.andM;SELECTING THE RIGHT SOFTWAREandM;Many commercial project management packages are available.andP;  Most of these arevery good and will exhibit a majority--but not all--of the characteristicsrecommended by software developers.andM;In the selection process, the operating platform is the initial criterion toconsider.andP;  Dozens of project management software packages, ranging in pricefrom $99 to $9,000, are offered for the IBM PC platform, and they all meet atleast some of the required criteria.andM;While the higher priced packages ($2,000 and up) tend to offer greaterfunctionatiliy and flexibility, there are many lower priced products thatrepresent an excellent value within the project management software market.andO;The cost of the software is likely to be but a small part of the total costs.andM;For the Applce Macintosh, there are two popular programs--MacProject, fromClaris Corp., Mountain View, Calif., and Micro Planner, from Micro PlanningSoftware, U.S.A., of San Francisco.andP;  The Mac has not been widely embraced asa business mangement platform, and has not received a great deal of attentionfrom project management software developers.andP;  Furthermore, a  major advantageof the Macintosh environment, the graphical interface, is now becomingavailable on the IBM PC machines.andM;In 1988, Micro Planning Software inttroducted a Windows version of MicroPlanner.andP;  Project scheduler 4, from Scitor Corp, Foster City, Calif.,andO;contains an independently developed graphical interface.andP;  Several vendors areworking on or considering Windows and Presentation Manager-based projectmanagement software products.andM;Systems for the Unix environment are limited, but this is changing.andO;Plantrac, from Computerline Inc., Pembroke, Mass., was an early supporter ofUnix as well as other platforms.andP;  Kandamp;H Professional Management Systems, Wayne,Pa.., is bringing its Prestige product out for the Unix market.andP;  Others arelikely to follow.andM;The mainframe has lost some ground to the microcomputer but remains apowerful force as a project management software platform.andP;  The IBM and DECVAX hardware are getting the most attention.andP;  Presently, there is littlesupport for minicomputer platforms, such as the HP-1000, HP-3000, Prime, DataGeneral and Wang systems.andM;AMong the better known vendors supporting the IBM and DEC VAX mainframeenvironment are: Metier Management Systems of Houston, (Artemis); ProjectSoftware andamp; Development Inc., Cambridge, Mass., (Project/2); AGS ManagementSystems, King of Prussia, Pa., (PAC-II, PAC-III, Wings); and Systonetics,Fullerton, Calif., (VISION).andM;Several other vendors support these two systems and other less popularplatforms, with additional vendors supporting either the IBM or DEC VAX, butnot both.andM;AIMED AT DEVELOPERSandM;Although most of the project management systems are addressed to projectmanagement applications, some are directed toward specific industries.andM;Two products designed particularly for managing MIS-type projects are:MicroMan II, from POC-IT Management, Santa Monica, Calif., and Multitrak,from Multitrak Software Development Corp., Boston.andM;MicroMan II runs on the IBM PC.andP;  Multitrak runs on IBM mainframes under MVSand CICS.andP;  A Multitrak/PC version is available to Multitrak users fordistributed processing.andP;  It requires a minimum 20Mb hard drive capacity.andM;Another MIS package, VAX Software Project Manager, was developed for in-houseuse by Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., and is now being soldexternally by DEC.andM;In general, the mainframe-type programs have extensive capabilities,especially if users are willing to create their own extension functions usingthe database tools available with many of these programs.andP;  Very few of theseproducts, despite their vast functionality, will support all of the user'sneeds without some customizing.andM;In the microcomputer department there is usually less customizing available.andO;But in many cases, packaged products have more functionality than mainframeproducts.andM;However, it is important to make sure these micro products will do the job.andO;No particular one is likely to meet every element of your selection criteria.andM;Many software developers need tools to help manage resources.andP;  Among thebetter known programs, one that emphasizes the resource management area isProject Workbench, from Applied Business Technology of New York City.andP;  AndTask Monitor, from Monitor Software, Los Altos, Calif., is versatile inassigning resource hours, including using &quot;all remaining unassigned hours&quot; asa resource loading rate.andM;Some programs have provisions to allow the resource application quantity andrate to determine the task duration.andP;  These include: Project Workbench; andViewPoint, from Computer Aided Management, Petaluma, Calif.; TimeLine 3.0,from Symantec, Novato, Calif.; and Harvard Total Project Manager II, fromSoftware Publishing, Mountain View, Calif.andM;A variation on this capability is offered by AMS Time Machine, fromDiversified Information Services, Studio City, Calif.andM;SuperProject Expert, from Computer Associates, San Jose, Calif., willrecalculate task duration if the resource application quantity and rate donot support the input duration.andM;Micro Planner and superProject Expert allow tasks to be interrupted to diverta scarce resource to more critical work.andM;The capability to manage project costs using earned value techniques may be arequirement for controlling software development projects.andP;  The framework forthese measurements is usually based on the configuration model, which isdescribed to the computer in either outline form or by means of a WBS (workbreakdown structure) coded hierarchy.andM;While the outline form is getting a lot of attention, user-coded WBS-typesystems offer much more versatility.andP;  The outline format was introduced byInstaPlan, from InstaPlan Corp, Mill Valley, Calif., and was quickly adoptedby TimeLine and SuperProject.andP;  Project Workbench also uses a form ofoutlining.andM;Primavera and Finest Hour, from Primavera Systems Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa., areprimary examples of the many programs that have extensive activity, resourceand cost account coding capabilities.andP;  Also, while the first three of theseprograms are capable of generating some type of earned value report, thesecapabilities are much more limited than those available in the two Primaveraproducts.andM;We are beginning to see more programs that have extensive cost managementcapabilities.andP;  These will appear both in separate modules and in modules thatcan interface with traditional critical path programs.andP;  Theseearned-value-based facilities are available at various levels.andM;At the most encompassing level are the programs that support theCost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria (S/SCSC) format.andP;  Designed to meet theformal requirements of certain government contracts, primarily in theaerospace and defense industry, the C/SCSC format has several attributes thatare useful for software development contracts that require a high degree ofcost control.andM;Previously supported only by mainframe and minicomputer systems (usuallyrequiring custom coding of the processes), C/SCSC programs are now emergingfor the microcomputer.andM;Examples of software specifically designed for C/SCSC applications are M*PM,from Microframe Technologies, Ontario, Calif., and Parade, from PrimaveraSystems.andP;  M*PM is the first full-function C/SCSC system for microcomputers.andO;Parade must be used with either Primavera or Finest Hour to obtain fullschedule, resource and cost management capabilities.andM;Integrated software with partial support for C/SCSC include Trakker Plus fromDekker Ltd., Redlands, Calif., and Task Monitor.andP;  Welcom Software, Houston,has announced a C/SCSC product (Cobra) and others are in the works.andP;  Oneproduct slated to provide C/SCSC capability across multiple platforms isI/CSCS, from Kandamp;H.andP;  Originally available for IBM mainframes, Kandamp;H will releaseVAX and PC versions of I/CSCS soon.andM;Additional products address the concepts of earned value measurement, butbudgets are assigned to the task as a whole, rather than to each period foreach task, as in C/SCSC.andP;  These products also tend not to address all of thespecial C/SCSC elements, such as burden rates, cost of money, etc.andP;  But theydo address items required for sophisticated cost management, such as multiplerollup codes (WBS, OBS, cost accounts), and C/SCSC measurement terms, likeBCWS, BCWP, ACWP, CV, SV, ETC and FAC.andM;These capabilities are found in most of the higher end micro programs, suchas Promis, from Strategic Software Planning Corp., Cambridge, Mass.;andO;Plantrac, Primavera and Artemis Project, from Metier Management Systems; OpenPlan, from Welcom; ViewPoint and Qwiknet Professional, from PSDI, Cambridge,Mass., and Prestige (next release).andM;REACHING THE MASS MARKETandM;The popularity of earned value measurements and reporting is reaching downinto mass market software.andP;  Popular products, such as SuperProject Expert andTimeLine, and even the tracker version of InstaPlan, are now offering atraditional C/SCSC-type report called the Cost Schedule Status Report (CSSR).andO;This is a very useful format for reporting earned value performance, butshould not be confused with a full C/SCSC capability.andM;Integration of work measurement (schedule progress) and cost measurementsystems, regardless of the mode, continues to be an elusive goal.andO;Impediments include: setting up matching measurement categories for bothprogress and cost, synchronization of the measurement timing and linking theproject mangement programs tothe accounting systems.andM;The topics of import/export and integration have a special meaning forsoftware development applications of project management software.andP;  Developersare almost certainly using some type of system development life cyclemethodology and one or more versions of Case tools.andM;Structured methodologies are a way of life in this environment, and Casetools, as they mature, will pay an ever increasing role in helping softwaredevelopers to reduce errors and development time.andM;Bill Pierpoint, system development division chief, San Bernardino County,Calif., would like to see project management software that has &quot;a knowledgeof the system development life cycle methodology used by the organization.andO;The system should present the project leader with a planning model based on aseries of questions concerning the size, complexity and type of projectderived from the organization's methodology.&quot;andM;Software developers for San Bernardino County are using MicroMan II forproject management.andM;Currently, there are few commercial systems available to integrate projectmanagement software, structured methodologies and Case tools.andP;  But it is aworthwhile objective that may eventually come to be, as the definition of theCase environment evolves.andM;Many of the major software development consulting services have developedtheir own in-house capabilities and have various levels of integration withinthese systems.andP;  American Management Systems has a five-component Case system,called Life-cycle Productivity System.andP;  One of these components (Life-cycleProject Manager) is integrated with ABT's Project Workbench.andM;Robbins-Gioia has developed its own set of program management softwareprojucts, called CAT.andP;  CAT handles many of the typical project managementfunctions and has application modules for configuration mangement, changecontrol, inventory control, earned value, problem reporting, documentationcontrol, order tracking and &quot;what-if&quot; analysis.andP;  It is not integrated withany external Case software.andM;The first comercial interface was actually announced last fall by AppliedBusiness Technology.andP;  It links ABT's Project Workbench (release 3.0) withIndex Technology's Case tool, Excelerator (release 1.8).andP;  The XL/PW interfacemay be obtained from either vendor at no charge.andM;ABT also announced it is developing an interface to AGS' PAC II.andP;  While bothare project management packages, they are frequently used for softwaredevelopment projects.andP;  PAC II is a mainframe product, while Project Workbenchoperates on the IBM personal computer.andM;Developers can write their own interface for any software with decentimport/export capabilities.andP;  One aerospace company is successfullytransferring data between VISION, Info, dBase III, Lotus 1-2-3 release 2,Wordstar Pro 4, TimeLine, Task Monitor and Harvard Total Project Manager.andO;The mainframe software (VISION and Info) is on a VAX system.andP;  The company hasa study under way on connecting its project management and computer-aidedsoftware engineering software.andM;FOCUSING ON MEASUREMENTandM;The link between the ABT Project Workbench and Excelerator may be the firstlink between two commercial products from the so-far separate worlds ofproject management and Case.andP;  But such linkages have been built internally byMIS departments for years, according to T. Capers Jones, chairman of SoftwareProductivity Research, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;At ITT, we were linking planning, tracking and estimation tools over fiveyears ago,&quot; said Jones.andM;The recently-announced Checkpoint product, Jones says, is among the first--ifnot the first--to integrate work measurement with cost measurement.andM;&quot;The hardest part is linking the measurement system with the accountingsystem,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Most non-government companes are almost incompetent inhow they account for software expenses.andP;  What's missing is unpaid overtime,which is invisible, and the cost of users' time given to MIS developmentefforts.andP;  This can account for 20% to 30% of the actual effort.&quot;andM;He asserted his measurement tool is actually more accurate than most softwaredevelopment accounting data, because it asks questions about unpaid overtime.andM;The integration of project management packages with Case Tools is likely tocontinue, Jones said.andP;  &quot;The industry is alert to the fact that this is thenext logical step.&quot;andM;The movement to integrate Case and project management is no stampede.andO;Although, a maturing of Case tools and project management software willgradually lead to more software that directly supports the softwaredevelopment processes, and to greater integration of the various softwarefunctions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
