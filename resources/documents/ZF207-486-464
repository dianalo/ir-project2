 Last month I described sole proprietorships andpartnerships.andP;  Both have their places.andP;  They're simple to establish andrelatively inexpensive to administer.andP;  Their basic units are individualpeople.andP;  A sole proprietorship has just one person, a partnership more thanone--simple.andP;  In contrast, a corporation exists apart from any individualhuman identity.andM;What is a &quot;corp.&quot;?andM;To some, the word &quot;corporation&quot; describes a massive, inhuman creature namedExxon or IBM.andP;  Actually, a corporation is nothing more than a legallyestablished &quot;person&quot;--separate and distinct from any actual human being.andP;  Acorporation is owned and populated by people, but it exists apart from thosewho created, own, manage, work for, or do business with it.andP;  Unlike the restof us, a corporation has perpetual life.andM;A corporation can do most of the legal and financial things you and I can do,like: enter into a contract, own property, incur liabilities, and pay taxes.andO;Obviously, people actually do these things--they act as representatives(&quot;agents&quot;) of the corporation.andM;A corporation is formed by applying to a state government.andP;  It's maintainedby following various laws, regulations, and required practices (which arevery important!).andP;  A corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect aboard of directors, which, in turn, is headed by a chairman.andP;  The boardappoints a group of officers (a president, secretary and treasurer areusually required) who are responsible for the business activities of thecorporation.andP;  Corporate officers are often employed by the firm as managers.andO;Managers may hire additional employees, and so on.andP;  In a small corporation,one person or a few people may fill all of these roles, but legally eachtitle carries its distinct authority and responsibility.andP;  (Most states alsoallow &quot;professional corporations&quot; with specialized requirements and limitedbenefits.)andM;A corporation (and no one else) is allowed to identify itself with the words&quot;incorporated,&quot; &quot;corporation,&quot; or &quot;limited.&quot;andP;  Limited describes one of themost valuable benefits of operating your business as a corporation.andP;  Let'ssay you make an innocent mistake that harms your client's business.andP;  It couldlead to you having to repay millions of dollars in damages.andP;  If you make thesame mistake as an employee of a corporation--even a corporation youown--you're somewhat isolated from the damages your client suffers.andP;  Yourcorporation might be asked to repay the millions lost when the client'sbusiness failed.andP;  But you won't personally be responsible for the amount yourcorporation can't come up with.andP;  There's a veil between you and thecorporation, the same veil that protects Exxon shareholders from beingcharged with the negligence of trashing Alaska.andP;  The value of their shares ofExxon stock may decline, but that's the &quot;limit&quot; to their businessresponsibility.andP;  Owning shares in a corporation that's unsuccessful, orliable for millions, or goes bankrupt, isn't a great investment.andP;  But that'sall it is--an investment.andP;  Win or lose, a shareholder has no more at stakethan the price originally paid for the stock.andM;For large corporations, this limited liability works well.andP;  For small firmswhere shareholders are also directors, officers and employees, the waters aremurkier.andP;  The theoretical protection is the same, but, if disaster strikesand it all hits the fan, the opposing lawyer will immediately try to &quot;piercethe corporate veil.&quot;andP;  This means trying to get the court to consider you, theindividual, as being the same as the corporation, with the same liability.andP;  Iemphasized the importance of following the rules of corporate procedure.andP;  Ifyou fail to operate your corporation correctly, at &quot;arms length,&quot; you givethe court grounds to decide that you shouldn't receive the corporate veil'sprotective benefits.andM;Tax advantagesandM;A second advantage of operating as a corporation is taxes.andP;  Don't get tooexcited; you'll still pay them--sometimes twice.andP;  A corporation pays taxes onprofits.andP;  Then, when profits are distributed as dividends, each shareholderdeclares the dividend payments as income and pays taxes on them.andP;  (A special&quot;S Corporation&quot; form can be used to avoid double taxation under certainlimited circumstances.)andP;  Double taxation is unavoidable when profits are paidout as dividends.andP;  But a corporation has other ways to pass out profits--taxfree.andP;  IRS regulation allow a corporation to provide &quot;fringe benefits&quot; toemployees.andP;  These benefits are deductible from the corporation's taxableincome, and not taxable to the individual.andP;  Medical insurance and retirementplans are two of the more popular benefits.andP;  Sole proprietorships andpartnerships can't provide as wide a range of tax-free benefits ascorporations can.andP;  Tax laws have been tightened to reduce the value of somecorporate benefits, but they're still worthwhile.andM;Because you're separate from your corporation, you can enter into variouskinds of mutual contracts and agreements.andP;  Depending upon the relative taxbrackets and financial condition of the parties, there can be tax benefits toloaning money to or borrowing from your corporation.andP;  Before incorporatingjust to receive the tax benefits, be sure you do &quot;what-if&quot; calculations.andP;  Thepotential for double taxation of dividends can wipe out any tax savings onbenefits.andM;Being incorporated can present a better image to clients and vendors.andP;  Imageis often the reason small business owners incorporate.andP;  You may impressclients, but vendors are wary of the limited liability aspect.andP;  Because manybusinesses fail in the first few years, vendors often refuse to grant creditto any corporation that hasn't been around for some time.andP;  Vendors know thatproprietors and partners are personally liable--they can come aftereverything you own.andP;  But a corporation may have a big name and little cash,so vendors often require a personal guarantee, making you individuallyresponsible as well.andM;If you're a vendor to a small and/or young corporation, you should takeprecautions too.andP;  A common scam is to start a corporation with very littlemoney and few assets, buy a bunch of merchandise on credit, sell it for cash,pay the cash to the employee/shareholders as salary or dividends, thendeclare that the corporation can't pay for the merchandise.andP;  The vendorsforce the corporation into bankruptcy, only to discover that there areassets.andP;  The vendors get zilch, and unless they can prove fraud, theswindlers walk away to start another corporation and run the scam again.andO;(Having bad business luck isn't illegal.andP;  Having bad luck intentionally isfraud.)andM;Corporation expensesandM;Operating as a corporation is more expensive than the other forms ofbusiness.andP;  The incorporation process costs money; fees must be paid eachyear; at least two tax returns must be filed (the corporation's and yours);and there's significantly more paperwork.andP;  If you're a proprietor or partner,your share of the company's profit is automatically personal income (be sureto pay self-employment tax).andP;  You'll only have to issue pay checks tonon-owner employees (if any).andP;  A corporation is different.andP;  Since you'reseparate from the corporation, profit remains within the corporation unlessit's paid to you as dividends and/or payroll.andP;  Growing companies rarely paydividends, since double taxation eats up cash that could be more productiveused by the business to grow.andP;  Instead, you'll pull money out as salary forwork performed.andP;  For a small firm, dealing with the complicated payrollprocess is a huge burden.andP;  The paper shuffling and additional taxesassociated with having employees (including yourself) create an expense youcan't avoid.andP;  Don't incorporate without considering the amount of additionaltime and money you'll need to spend.andM;Unless you go it alone, you'll have someone else involved in your business asa partner, shareholders, or even a spouse.andP;  Dealing with partners is easierwhen the business is incorporated, since the roles of shareholder/investorand officer/manager/employee are separate.andP;  Unlike a partner, corporateshareholders can't legally obligate the corporation.andP;  However, an officer canobligate the corporation, as can an employee under many circumstances.andM;Buy/Sell issuesandM;The big issue with partners of whatever legal business form, is what happenswhen you part company.andP;  A partnership seems like the obvious way to havepartner, but it exists only as long as all partners agree.andP;  As I discussedlast month, a partner who wants out can destroy the business.andP;  Let's saythree partners start a business and built it up to be worth $600,000.andP;  Then,one of the partners wants out.andP;  The departing partner has an absolute rightto one-third of the value of the business.andP;  If the remaining two partnerscan't come up with $100,000 each, they're left with two choices: They cansell the partner's share to a new person, who should be personally qualifiedand must come up with $200,000; or they can liquidate enough of the firm'sassets to free up $200,000.andP;  How many small businesses could do that andsurvive?andM;The same issue holds for shareholders in a corporation, except that thecorporate form is designed to transfer ownership shares without affecting thebusiness.andP;  A departing shareholder can't claim assets unless the corporationis bankrupt or being liquidated.andP;  The corporation has no responsibility tohelp a shareholder &quot;cash-out.&quot;andP;  The shareholder must sell the stock tosomeone else, or keep it.andP;  That's the theory.andP;  Life is predictably messier.andM;In most small and many medium-sized firms, shareholders are alsoofficers/managers, making the problem of a shareholder sellout almostidentical to a departing partner.andP;  Who'll buy the departing shareholder'sstock?andP;  Investing in a small corporation doesn't appeal to everyone.andO;Besides, an owner-operated business may not want a stranger to buy in, so theremaining shareholders, or the corporation, must purchase the stock.andP;  Eitherway, the money must be available.andP;  Coming up with it can be just as difficultand damaging as in a partnership.andM;You can't prevent the departure of a partner or shareholder, but you canminimize the potential for damage.andP;  The partnership agreement or corporationby-laws should establish a reasonable way for someone to get out whileprotecting the stability of the firm and the interests of the remainingparticipants.andP;  A time payment plan can be specified to protect assets andworking capital.andP;  It should also establish a way determine the firm's marketvalue.andP;  A firm's &quot;book&quot; value doesn't take into account its market positionand company image, growth rate, potential, appreciated assets, or otherintangibles.andP;  Setting a fair value can be difficult.andP;  The seller wants tomaximize its value while the remaining buyers want to maximize it.andP;  Onemethod is to define market value as some multiple of annual net income (cashflow) or net profit (taxable income).andM;Don't forget the silent partners.andP;  In most states, a married person has apartner, even if the partner isn't active in the business.andP;  Communityproperty laws give each spouse equal ownership in everything acquired aftermarriage (with a few exceptions, like an inheritance).andP;  The most commonproblem is divorce.andP;  A spouse may leave a marriage and retain an equalinterest in the firm (and perhaps seek to exercise unwanted control orparticipation).andP;  The only way to prevent this is with a buyout, with all ofthe problems described above.andP;  Entire companies can be shaken or damaged bythe repercussions of a divorce.andP;  If possible, have the spouse of eachpartner/shareholders sign the buy/sell agreement, agreeing to be bought outupon demand at fair market value.andM;Is &quot;inc.&quot; for you?andM;Incorporation is expensive to establish and maintain, but inexpensive if youwould otherwise face unlimited liability.andP;  You, your attorney, and your CPAmay (and generally should) spend a lot of time together.andP;  A corporation is acontinual burden--and an intimate partner with several government agencies.andO;If you aren't prepared to do it 100 percent, don't bother; you'll make thegovernment grumpy, and the corporate veil won't protect you when you need it.andM;One alternative for the individual developer or VAR is to form a cooperativerelationship with an established, incorporated VAR.andP;  You can benefit fromtheir experience, organization, and legal structure without having to investin it.andP;  Having talent, energy, desire, and prospects is only the beginning tobeing in the VAR business.andP;  Whenever opportunity knocks, consider the risksas well as the rewards.andM;John L.
