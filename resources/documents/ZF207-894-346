It'sa market that's been around not quite since the founding of Rome, butcertainly since the founding ofoptical character recognition (OCR) in andaround the 1960s.andP;  And surely it will be with us until the third millennium.andM;But for all the time it's been around, document scanning has always beenaperennial about-to-be, waiting like some overlooked maiden for some othermarket to give it the demand boost it needs to reach glory.andM;Scanner boost arrivesandM;The boost may finally have come.andP;  The advent of electronic publishing ingeneral and desktop publishing in particular has turned the requirement forscanned input from an arcane need associated with the limited use of OCR to ageneral need for compound document publishing.andP;  In addition, falling unitprices, the availability of desktop models, and increasing functionalitythrough better technology have added just the fillip the market needed totake off.andM;In its traditional form -- the high-end, host-based system -- the scannermarket is sleepy.andP;  From 1989 to 1993 it will show an average compound growthrate of 12%, according to figures from BIS CAP International, Norwell, MA.andO;But, thanks to desktop scanning, the entire market will show a growth rateclose to 40% for that period.andM;What's more, by then the market will have entered the big leagues -- bycracking $1 billion in U.S.andP;  revenues.andM;Unit growth way upandM;Unit growth is even more spectacular -- from 186,000 units shipped last year(60,000 of which were desktop units) to 877,000 to be shipped in 1993(428,000 desktop units).andP;  Whew.andP;  Were it not for costs that are falling, onaverage, from $3,400 for a desktop scanner last year to $1,200 by 1993, thosemarket revenues would be even higher.andM;As it is, the market has moved fast.andP;  From 1987 to 1988 the total U.S.andO;scanner market jumped 61% from $143 million to $230 million, and this year,according to BIS CAP, it will jump 66% again to $382 million.andM;Some of the reasons for the market growth are understandable -- fallingprices and the rise of desktop publishing ought to be enough to generateincreased demand.andP;  But there are some more subtle drivers as well.andM;Portability helpsandM;&quot;We've picked up two new influences recently,&quot; notes Cathy Dingman, managerof imaging systems research for BIS CAP International.andP;  &quot;The first is theresurgence of the OCR market resulting from an increase in software and theunbundling of the software from the systems.andP;  The second is the growingpopularity of low-priced portable scanners.andP;  These allow users to experimentwith scanning at a low pain threshold; those experiments should translate tomore demand for desktop scanners.&quot;andM;One of the reasons the scanner market is expected to grow so nicely is thatpeople are finding new ways to use the technology.andP;  Back in 1985, forinstance, according to BIS CAP, scanners were used for publishing aboutthree-quarters of the time and OCR the rest (by revenue).andM;New applications arrivingandM;By 1993, though, publishing will only account for 28% of scanner sales andOCR 20% (having reached a low point of 15% last year).andP;  Multi-use scanners,which barely existed in 1985 and 1986 will make up 25% of the market andproduction-use scanners will make up 16%.andP;  With electronic publishing stillgrowing and OCR on the upswing, these new applications bode especially wellfor the market's health.andM;Of course these forecasts are only numbers, not reality.andP;  The question ofwhether the market will fulfill the BIS CAP potential seems related to thequestion of how much falling prices will increase demand and how much theywill merely increase the speed of the manufacturers' margin treadmill?andP;  It'snot yet clear.andP;  There don't seem to be any scanner millionaires out thereyet.andM;What is clear is that there are forces on the market that work both for andagainst its blossoming.andP;  They include:andM;Unit price dropandM;* That unbundling of the OCR software and the resurgence of the OCR marketand, hence, scanners; the drop in unit prices that lower the barriers toexperimentation.andM;Desktop publishingandM;* The growing market for desktop publishing and the resultant need for inputof nontext documents.andM;Multifunction versatilityandM;* Many of the desktop scanners can be used for graphics, OCR, input toPC/fax, or teleconferencing.andP;  Heretofore, feature-rich high-end scanners wereoften dedicated to single functions.andM;Better accuracyandM;* Early desktop scanners lacked the accuracy and precision of today's units.andO;Since correcting scanned errors can be costly, early units often belied thecost justifications used to purchase them.andM;More featuresandM;* Wider feature and function range.andP;  The availability of all manner ofgray-scale and color capability and the availability of everything fromhand-held to high-end scanners for E-size drawings means the market is nolonger a spot product market.andP;  With more to choose from, users are morelikely to choose.andM;Text recognitionandM;* The ability of the new breed of scanners to recognize text and produce itas character output rather than bit-mapped graphics has made the scanning ofdocuments both more economical and of higher resolution.andM;Help with paperandM;* The availability of increasingly reliable sheet-fed scanners is taking someof the physical pain out of the scanner input process.andM;DistributionandM;* Computer dealers and distributors, one of the prime ways desktop scannersget to market, are generally in the dark when it comes to scannerapplications, functionality, and justifications.andP;  This limits missionaryselling on the behalf of scanning.andM;Need for standard interfacesandM;* Application software and scanners aren't yet as easily connected as laserprinters and computers -- i.e., activating and controlling the scanner fromthe application can be difficult, or at least scanner-specific.andP;  There's nosoftware that does for scanners what Adobe's Postscript has done for laserprinters.andP;  Although Apple has made its Applescanner software interfaceavailable, and a number of vendors are adopting it, that still leaves a lotof compatibility to go.andM;Rising memory needsandM;* Peripheral and memory demands.andP;  Gray scale and color scanners can producehuge data files associated with their images, which means users can easilyunderestimate the total cost of their scanning implementations.andP;  An 8-1/2 by11 image scanned at 300 dpi with 64 gray levels eats up more than 6 megabytesof memory.andM;Output degradation.andM;* In many cases the laser printers in desktop publishing applications can'treproduce the gray scales scanned in and captured electronically to thedegree of resolution of the scanner -- so what you see on the screen is morethan what you get.andM;User costs hiddenandM;* Scanning can be a more complex art than many users realize at first,requiring in some cases both professional -- or at least dedicated -- skillsand sometimes the use of service bureaus for backup and support.andM;From luxury, a toolandM;We tend to think the market enhancers outweigh the inhibitors -- since theinhibitors will continue to fall as time goes on and the enhancers pick up.andO;Memory and peripherals will keep getting cheaper, as will the scannersthemselves.andP;  Users will get more proficient at scanning -- and scanning willcease being a luxury and commence being a production tool.andM;Over time, more and more of the software issues will be solved.andP;  In addition,technology development in copiers, laser printing, and facsimile will allspill over into scanning.andP;  The outlook could definitely be worse.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
