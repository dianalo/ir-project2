Heil, charging that a recent filing he made with the Securities and Exchange Commission is &quot;materially false and misleading.&quot;    As previously reported, Mr. Heil, president of American Environmental Construction Co., Downers Grove, Ill., disclosed last week that he holds a 6.2% Morrison stake and may seek board representation. Morrison has subsequently expressed concern that Mr. Heil's investment may complicate its ability to pursue public construction projects in Illinois, because Mr. Heil is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Illinois authorities. The Illinois suit alleges fraud in connection with a construction project for which Mr. Heil's company was a contractor.    Morrison said its lawsuit, filed in federal district court here, alleges that Mr. Heil's recent SEC filing failed to disclose the &quot;direct threat&quot; his problems with Illinois authorities could represent for the company. The suit also alleges that Mr. Heil's filing failed to disclose that his purchases of Morrison common shares &quot;were made in apparent violation of the reporting requirements and waiting period&quot; imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.    Mr. Heil couldn't be reached for comment.    Separately, Morrison said a unit received a contract of about $130 million from the New York City Transit Authority, to rebuild 296 railroad transit cars. The work will begin later this year at the company's Hornell, N.Y., complex. </TEXT></DOC>
