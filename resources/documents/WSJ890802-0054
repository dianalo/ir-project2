In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group, which includes Zohar Ben-Dov of Middleburg, Va., and Allen S. Greene of New York, also said it's considering soliciting proxies in support of a slate of directors to oppose VSB's management nominees. The group said its members are &quot;not satisfied with {VSB's} performance and do not perceive that management is fully committed to enhancing shareholder values.&quot;    VSB, the Closter, N.J., holding company for Valley Savings Bank, said in a statement, &quot;Any speculation on selling our bank operations is premature.&quot;    Since VSB went public last October, its shares have risen about 20% above the offering price, &quot;providing an excellent return to shareholders,&quot; the company said.    The investor group holds 217,000 VSB common shares, including 18,000 bought May 16 and 17 for $12.35 to $12.435 each. In national over-the-counter trading, VSB closed unchanged at $12.50 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
