The Shawn Hughes hospice, named after the man hospice officialssay was the first employee of the nearby city of West Hollywood todie of AIDS, opened Monday in a leased, bungalow-stylethree-bedroom home.   Unhappy neighbors say they fear the hospice will bringambulances, hospital supply trucks, and, eventually, cars from thecounty coroner's office to their quiet residential street.   ``It's like living next to a hospital,'' said Tom Meleck, whosehome is directly behind the hospice.   But City Councilman Michael Woo said the hospice is not ahospital, but ``a place where AIDS patients can die with respectand dignity.''   Some residents had attempted to keep the facility from opening,saying it needed a zoning variance to operate in the neighborhood.But the city attorney's office said that hospices could operate inresidential zones as long as they were kept to a maximum of sixbeds, Woo said.   Alex Hensel, who leased the home to Hospice Los Angeles@LongBeach, said he was shocked by his neighbors' reaction.   ``What I found out is that except for the two closest neighbors... the rest were only concerned about property values _ `After somany years here, I'm going to lose...,''' Hensel said.   ``This isn't a hospital,'' he added. ``It's just a chance forpeople in their last few days to have some warm feelings in theirhearts,''   Hospice Los Angeles@Long Beach operates two other hospicefacilities in Long Beach. The newest hospice costs $7,000 a monthto run, and operators are hoping for a $200,000 county grant to paybills for the rest of the year.   ``Without it, we may have to close this place down,'' saidExecutive Director Ron Wolff.   More than 1,200 people in the Hollywood-Wilshire area werediagnosed between 1981 and 1987 as having AIDS, said Peter Kerndt,medical director of the Los Angeles County AIDS EpidemiologyDepartment. Sixty-two percent of them have died.   ``Until now, there has been no facility in the city that givesthe victims, who are our neighbors, a decent place to die inpeace,'' Woo said. ``This is long overdue.''</TEXT></DOC>
