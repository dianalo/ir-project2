That Power Allocation was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 19032) dated March 24, 1980. By letterdated January 24, 1984, President Reagan set forth a couse of action forFederal agencies to negotiate reasonable non-Federal funding prior to thestart of construction for new Federal hydroelectric power projects (newFederal projects). The 1980 SWPA Power Allocation does not address theallocation of new power from construction of new Federal projects withfunds advanced by non-Federal entities. As a result of these changing conditions,SWPA believed a policy was needed to address the allocation of new powerthat may become available for marketing from existing and new, Federallyand non-Federally funded, hydroelectric power projects. SWPA publishedthe Power Allocation Policy (Policy) in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>August 12, 1987, (52 FR 29881).Section I, Paragraph 3 of the Policy announced ``New customers shall beselected in accordance with SWPA's New Customer Selection Policy.'' ThePolicy provided ten percent of any power available for allocation, otherthan power to a non-Federal project sponsor, would be allocated to newcustomers. SWPA has received many formal and informal requests for allocationsof power and energy from the SWPA hydroelectric power system. Therefore,in accordance with the above, SWPA has developed a New Customer SelectionPolicy. The New Customer Selection Policy should not be confused with theselection procedure and criteria for non-Federal entities (sponsors willingto provide funding prior to the start of construction for new Federal hydroelectricpower projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>The policy for selection of new customers is hereby adopted,effective April 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Questions may be mailed to: Francis R.

Gajan, Director ofPower Marketing (918) 581-7529.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The New Customer Selection Policy addressesthe criteria and procedures SWPA will use in selecting new customers whenFederal hydroelectric power is available for allocation. This policy isa separate procedure from the selection of a non-Federal sponsor to participatefinancially in the development of a Federal hydroelectric power project.An entity applying to be a new customer of SWPA could also be a non-Federalsponsor for a project. Allocations will be made to new customers and non-Federalsponsors according to the SWPA Power Allocation Policy in effect a at thetime of the allocation.SWPA published a Notice of Intent to Develop Policy for New Customer Selectionin the Federal Register of February Register of February 10, 1987 (52 FR4186). In the notice SWPA requested that interested parties provide commentsand suggestions to SWPA by March 12, 1987, concerning the formulation ofthe policy. The comments and suggestions received were considered in thedevelopment of a proposed policy. A proposed policy was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27387) dated July 20, 1988. Nine letterswere received during the comment period for the proposed policy. Many ofthe comments pertain to SWPA's Power Allocation Policy and were addressedduring the public review period for that policy. Summaries of the commentsreceived on the proposed New Customer Selection Policy and SWPA's responsesfollow.1. Comment_We suggest that it would be necessary to update the informationprovided by each applicant regarding the applicant's ability to use andreceive that allocation at the time that the new allocation is being consideredin order to determine if the applicant continues to qualify for an allocationof hydroelectric power under the Customer Selection Policy in effect.SWPA Response_SWPA agrees. Before an allocation is made, each applicantwill be required to supplement its original application and demonstratethat it qualifies for an allocation of hydroelectric power under the CustomerSelection Policy then in effect.2. Comment_We suggest that consideration also be given to the ability ofSWPA to ``wheel'' the allocated hydroelectric power and energy in the mostefficient and business-like manner given existing transmission systemsavailable to SWPA.SWPA Response_SWPA does not believe ``wheeling'' should be part of theselection criteria. It is the responsibility of the applicant to show itsability to receive the power. If it is not economical for the applicantto receive the power, the applicant in most cases would not enter intoa pwer sales agreement.3. Comment_We suggest that priority be given to proposed new customerswho are geographically located in the vicinity of the source of the hydroelectricenergy to be allocated. While it may be argued that geographical considerationsare not consistent with the ``widespread use'' policy under the relevantsection of the Flood Control Act of 1944, it is also true that to the extentthat the new hydroelectric power to be allocated comes from a non-federallyfunded project, compliance with the 1944 act is not necessarily requiredby law.SWPA Response_SWPA does not agree. Although new hydroelectric power projectsmay be funded with non-Federal funds, SWPA must operate the program inaccordance with the terms of section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944,as amended. Accordingly, SWPA must comply with the ``widespread use'' sectionof the law.4. Comment_We are opposed to SWPA basing the amount of power and energyset aside for new customers in states without pending applications on the``fair share'' allocation approach. States without pending applicationsfor new customers on file with SWPA should not be considered for new customerallocations at all. If prospective customers for SWPA hydroelectric powerfail to apply for power, there is no reason to set aside any amount ofpower and energy to be allocated to that state.SWPA Response_The amount of power to be allocated to new customers is 10percent of the amount of power available for allocation, other than powerbeing allocated to a non-Federal sponsor of a project. SWPA believes eachState should receive a distribution of power for new customers. If thereare no applicants from a State, SWPA believes the distribution for newcustomers in that State should be allocated to new customers in the Statethat is most deficient in its fair share allocation.5. Comment_We concur with the previously received comment that existingpower allocation should remain in effect and existing power sales contractshould be satisfied before new preference customers are given an allocation.SWPA Response_The 1980 power allocations were made using known existingand future resources, and those allocations will remain in effect accordingto the 1980 Final Power Allocations. Power sale contracts related to the1980 power allocations will be satisifed when the existing and future resourcesreferred to therein are available. Any new allocations and related powersales agreements will be made in accordance with the allocation policyin effect at the time power becomes available for allocation.6. Comment_We do not concur with the ``first requested, first served''concept as the basis for new customer selection. An alternative would beto request application every time an allocation is to be made. Each applicantshould be considered for a pro rata share of capacity. Also, it does notappear proper that letters of application submitted 5, 10, or 20 yearsearlier should remain valid for projects conceived and constructed in morecurrent times without resubmittal of an application.    SWPA Response_While the suggestion that application be made each time anallocation is available has merit, SWPA believes that the ``first requested-firstserved'' procedure for new customer selection is the best procedure underthe circumstances. Administratively, this procedure avoids the duplicationof effort required by refiling. In addition, a workable chronological listhas been developed which can serve as a basis for the selection procedure.Since 1966, prospective customers have requested an allocation of federalhydroelectric power from SWPA. Because SWPA has not had additional hydroelectricpower to allocate to all of them, SWPA has developed a list of these potentialnew customers. Although no system will be entirely unbiased, SWPA believesthat the use of this chronological list will involve the minimum amountof problems for customer selection. SWPA believes that, for the sake ofconsistency, the allocation of any new power to new customers should bemade proportionately but on the same basis established under the PowerAllocation Policy published August 12, 1987 (52 FR 29881). The ratio usedin that Policy is the new customer's peak load to its state's peak loadtimes the amount of power to be allocated to new customers in that state.<ITAG tagnum="84">Southwestern Power Administration New Customer Selection Policy   </ITAG>The Administrator shall select new customers (applicants) based on thefollowing criteria:    1.
