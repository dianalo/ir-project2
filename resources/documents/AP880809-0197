On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Septemberdelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude oil, advanced 61 cents Monday to close at $15.87 a barrel.   Prices of refined oil products traded on theexchange alsosoared. Wholesale heating oil for September delivery jumped 1.46cents a gallon to finish at 44.50 cents, while wholesale unleadedgasoline for September rose 1.42 cents to 46.65 cents.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced thatIran and Iraq would begin a cease-fire in their Persian Gulf war onAug. 20. The news followed several days of intense diplomacy thatended a deadlock in nearly two weeks of U.N.-mediated truce talks.   ``The notice of a cease-fire was the primary positive,'' saidFred Demler, an economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Many oil traders believe the cease-fire will lead to morecohesion within the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, of which Iran and Iraq are members. That could lead to areduction of overproduction by they and other OPEC members.   But other traders are more skeptical. They warn that Iran andIraq will badly need oil revenues after the war to rebuild theirravaged economies, and will be tempted to continue to exceed theirofficial OPEC production quotas.   Demler said the advance in futures prices also was fueled bytechnical market factors.</TEXT></DOC>
