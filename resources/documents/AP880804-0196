Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., thesponsor of the bill and chairman of the finance subcommittee of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee.   Securities firms had been fighting the measure but dropped theirobjections after Markey agreed in talks late Tuesday to soften someof the bill's provisions.   The Securities Industry Association, at a hearing last month,objected to making companies liable when their employees usenon-public information to profit by trading securities.   The bill as passed requires companies to have systems designedto detect insider trading, but it limits their liability toviolations in which they either knew or ``recklessly disregarded''the facts.   Brokerage firms were also worried about the bounty provisions,arguing that they would give in-house compliance officers anincentive to withhold knowledge of wrongdoing from the firm inhopes of collecting a bounty later.   However, according to a Securities Industry Association officialwho spoke on condition of anonymity, Markey has agreed to limit thesituations in which a brokerage firm employee could collect thebounty, which would be capped at 10 percent of any penalty levied.   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo of New Jersey, the ranking Republican onthe committee, said the compromise ``provides a substantialdeterrent on insider trading ... without placing an undue burden onthe securities industry.''   In other provisions, the legislation would:   _Increase the maximum criminal insider trading fine from thecurrent $100,000 for individuals and $500,000 for corporations andpartnerships to $1 million for individuals and $2.5 million forfirms.   _Boost the maximum jail term from five years to 10 years.   _Create a legal basis for private investors to sue to recovermoney lost because of inside trading.   _Give the Securities and Exchange Commission power to issuesubpoenas and take sworn statements on behalf of foreign agenciespursuing securities violations. The SEC intends to ask foreigncountries to return the service.   The bill, adopted by the finance subcommittee on a voice vote,avoids a controversial question that has held up insider tradinglegislation for more than a year: how broadly or narrowly to defineinsider trading.   The offense is currently defined by court and regulatoryinterpretation. Securities firms had been seeking a better guidefor determining if a particular activity were illegal. Othersargued that a definition would simply provide ``a roadmap forevasion.''   The Senate Banking Committee last week passed a much narrowerinsider trading bill, including only the provisions oninternational cooperation.   Markey said he hoped the full Energy and Commerce Committeecould act as soon as next week. If the bill passes the full House,he said he would seek to include its provisions when the House andSenate versions are reconciled.   An aide to Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the SenateBanking Committee, said the senator is inclined to favor Markey'sbroader legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
