Aromatic and aliphaticytterbium derivatives undergo a reaction of cross combination with organiciodides and bromides under catalysis by NiCl/sub 2/(PPh/sub 3/)/sub 2/and Pd(PPh/sub 3/)/sub 4/ complexes. Therewith organo-ytterbium compoundsquantitatively react with alkyl (aryl) iodides, bromine substitutionfor iodine in arylhalogenides results in decrease of yield of cross-combinationproducts. Reactions of organo-ytterbium compounds with organic halogenidesare more effectively catalysed by nickel complexes than by palladiumones.</TEXT></DOC>
