(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration is ``greatlyconcerned'' that Israel may have provided South Africa with Americantechnology used in a South African missile test, a U.S. officialsaid Wednesday.   As a result, an Israeli request to buy six supercomputers fromthe United States will be given special scrutiny, the official saidat an arms control symposium on the Eastern shore of Maryland.   ``The request is being held because we are concerned,'' theofficial said. ``We are greatly concerned Israel could havetransferred U.S. technology.''   Questions have been raised over the years about Israel's militaryties with South Africa. The official, speaking under seminar rulesthat barred further identification, acknowledged that ``the UnitedStates does not know the extent of Israel's relationship with SouthAfrica.''   But, the official said, technology used by South Africa in lastsummer's missile test exceded the country's known capabilities.   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the cabinet lastmonth that Israel had not given South Africa any military technologydeveloped or funded by the United States.   The denial followed a statement by President Bush that transfersof forbidden technology were ``taboo'' and that ``it would notenhance relations'' if Israel defied the United States to help SouthAfrica develop a nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile.   NBC News had reported that Israel provided Pretoria with know-howfrom Israel's canceled Lavi jet plane program, financed largely bythe United States.   The U.S. official who spoke at the arms control symposium alsoraised questions about a South African fighter plane known as theCheetah, saying it was ``virtually a mirror image'' of an Israeliplane.   Also, the official raised questions about Israel's program, knownas Aarow, that is designed to defend against ballistic missiles thatare proliferating in the Arab world.   On a related subject, the official said the United States had notreached a conclusion whether South Africa conducted a nuclear test10 years ago with Israeli help.   Earlier, another U.S. official said Poland, in a strong show ofindependence, would disband four of its 13 military divisions.Polish authorities also have notified the Soviet Union that it wouldnot participate in an upgrading Warsaw Pact forces, the officialsaid.   Two other divisions are being placed on stand-by, which meansabout 10 percent of the division troops will remain on active dutywhile the remaining will be sent home. The four disbanded divisionshave about 40,000 troops.   Poland told the Soviet Union it was taking the steps because ofeconomic necessity, the U.S. official said at an arms controlsymposium at the Wye Plantation on the Eastern shore of Maryland.   The official, who could not be identified under the seminarrules, said the Soviets apparently raised no objections.   The Soviets also are in the midst of a partial withdrawal fromEastern Europe. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee, said last week that three tank divisions hadbeen pulled out in past 11 months although some new artillery hadbeen sent into the region.   Poland and Hungary are showing their independence in other waysas well, U.S. officials said. They are putting pressure on theSoviet Union for the Warsaw Pact to reach agreement with NATO inVienna on a reduction of troops and non-nuclear weapons acrossEurope.   Polish and Hungarian officials are speaking out and registeringtheir views in the negotiations for the first time, the officialsaid.   Reporting progress on a 1987 treaty to abolish U.S. and Sovietintermediate-range nuclear missiles, officials said the Soviets haddestroyed 297 of their arsenal of 654 SS-20s. The others are due tobe scrapped over the next two years.   The United States, keeping pace, has eliminated 486 of its 846intermediate-range rockets covered by the treaty.   The United States this week is installing a $38 million X-raydevice at Votkinsk, the factory where SS-20 missiles weremanufactured, to improve inspection of rail cars carrying otherstill-legal missiles from the factory.</TEXT></DOC>
