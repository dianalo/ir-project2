Expectations that strikers would continue to defy aback-to-work order from their union and the Norwegiangovernment faded as strike activity in the huge Ekofisk oilfield came to an end. Reports that there were still pocketsof resistance at other installations, however, prompted abrief rally shortly before trading ended.</LP><TEXT>   Crude oil for August delivery slipped 30 cents to $16.50 abarrel in light trading, with many market participants takingan extended holiday after Wednesday's Independence Dayclosing.   Heating oil and gasoline prices also were lower as weeklystatistics showed that refineries are beginning to increasetheir output of petroleum products.   If the Norwegian strikes end, it will be up to theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up theprice of oil. There are indications that Kuwait, which isdemanding a higher quota despite a global oil glut, mightrelax its stance until the price for the OPEC basket ofcrudes approaches the cartel's goal of $18 a barrel. Itcurrently stands at only slightly more than $14 a barrel.   There also were reports that OPEC leaders might be tryingto define a strategy that would accommodate Kuwait's desireto produce more than its current daily quota of 1.5 millionbarrels.   The oil ministers of Kuwait and Indonesia ended two daysof meetings with acting OPEC President Sadek Boussena inAlgiers yesterday. Mr. Boussena has been appealing to OPECleaders to put aside their individual needs until higherprices are re-established.   If he has persuaded the Kuwaitis to be more flexible, &quot;itwould be a surprising switch in policy possibly meaning moreharmony within the cartel and maybe higher oil prices,&quot; saidNauman Barakat, first vice president for international energyfutures at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   In one bearish development, however, the InternationalEnergy Agency reported that OPEC pumped 23.2 million barrelsa day in June. And there is little likelihood that productionwill decline much below 23 million barrels a day even if thecartel, at its July 25 meeting, reaffirms its dailyproduction quota of 22 million barrels.   However, demand for oil can be expected to rise in thethird and fourth quarters, which might make a productionlevel of 23 million barrels a day more acceptable, analystssay.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Forecasts of an end to a relativelybrief Midwest heat wave drove corn and soybean futures priceslower. Temperatures approached 100 degrees Fahrenheit earlythis week in Iowa and some surrounding states, but privatemeteorologists are predicting cooler temperatures and rainacross much of the region. Corn for December delivery settledat $2.805 a bushel, down its daily limit of 10 cents. Aninitial price plunge triggered heavy selling bytrend-following commodity funds and other speculators, allbut ensuring that futures prices would remain depressed forthe rest of the session, analysts said. Richard Dennis, oneof the most active speculators in grain futures contracts onthe Chicago Board of Trade, was widely rumored by analysts tohave been the largest single seller of December corn futures.As a matter of policy, the reclusive futures trader declinesto comment on his activity. Soybeans for July deliverysettled at $6.2850 a bushel, down 20 cents.                                                                                                          COTTON: Prices swung wildly. The July contract ended threecents a pound higher at 92.80 cents after trading as high as93.90 cents. The October contract, which reflects both thecurrent crop and the next crop year, finished at 80.74 centsa pound, up 0.69 cent, after reaching a high of 82.05 cents.The December contract, reflecting new-crop conditions, tradedas high as 77 cents a pound but ended at 75.62 cents, down0.16 cent. Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist at Merrill LynchFutures in New York, said the July contract, which expiresMonday and now has no limit on price moves, helped liftnew-crop prices to life-of-contract highs early in thesession. Just before the close, however, selling developed inthese contracts. &quot;I think profit-taking hit the market,&quot; Mr.Mueller said. The July open interest, or number of contractsremaining to be nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilledby delivery of cotton, is well above 1,000, an unusuallylarge number this close to expiration, Mr. Mueller said.However, he said, what little cotton there is around is goinginto the higher-priced cash market and isn't being certifiedfor delivery against open futures contracts.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices were driven higher by speculationabout a tightening of supplies. Copper for September deliveryreached a life-of-contract high of $1.1695 a pound beforesettling at $1.1605, up 2.95 cents from Tuesday. The mostsignificant news seemed to be a report of an explosion at oneof Chile's Codelco mines, El Teniente. Codelco is the world'sbiggest copper producer. There also were rumors of laborproblems in the copper mines in Chile. David Threlkeld,president of Threlkeld andamp; Co., a Vermont-based internationalmetals dealer, said copper companies might produce 350,000metric tons less this year than users will demand. &quot;And thereisn't 350,000 tons in stocks to be drawn down,&quot; he said. Ametric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. Mr. Threlkeld cautioned thatthe demand estimate assumes there won't be a recession in theU.S. He also said Codelco, which originally estimated itsproduction for the year at 1,290,000 metric tons, has reducedthat number by 100,000 tons. Mr. Threlkeld has estimated thatCodelco will produce only 1,050,000 metric tons. He alsoestimates that the world used 120,000 metric tons more copperin the first four months of the year than it produced.</TEXT></DOC>
