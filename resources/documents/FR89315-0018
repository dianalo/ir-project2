L. 100-17, theUniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987, and, to the extent feasible,with the interpretation of the 1987 amendments by the Federal Highway Administrationin its recently published final governmentwide rule. The 1987 amendmentsmade moderate increases in benefit levels, most of which were previouslyput into effect by the Postal Service in January 1988. In addition, theamendments changed the Uniform Relocation Act to cover virtually any organization,even private persons, if they displace persons or businesses pursuant toa Federal or Federally-assisted program or project. The amendments alsoprovide that the computation of certain relocation benefits be done inaccordance with the regulations of the Federal Highway Administration,which is the lead agency, rather than pursuant to a statutory formula.It is the latter amendments that this final rule is primarily implementing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Fred Underwood, (202) 268-3111.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On December 17, 1987, the Postal Servicepublished a final rule implementing those parts of the Uniform RelocationAct Amendments of 1987 (principally increases in benefit levels) concerningwhich the statute apparently intended little discretion or interpretationwould be available to agencies (52 FR 48029). It is the discretionary andinterpretive parts of the statute that this final rule is implementing,and the governmentwide rule of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)that is being generally followed. We are also making several minor, editorialchanges in our regulations.After notice and comment rulemaking, the FHWA's final rule was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 2, 1989 and became effective the samedate (54 FR 8912). That document contains a comprehensive explanation ofthe governmentwide rule, its regulatory background, and the intention ofCongress in enacting the Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987.Although exempt by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the provisions of the AdministrativeProcedure Act regarding rulemaking, 5 U.S.C. 553, the Postal Service ordinarilyseeks public comment on changes to its regulations perceived to have aneffect on the public. In this case, however, the FHWA has already receivedand considered voluminous public comment on the substance of the very changeswe are adopting. Accordingly, the Postal Service finds it unnecessary toseek further public comment. In addition, the Postal Service ordinarilydelays for 30 days the effective date of its final regulations, as alsoprovided by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d). In thiscase, however, we find that the purposes of the 30 day delayed effectivedate (notification of potential parties affected) are satisfied by thepublication of FHWA's final rule. Moreover, the Uniform Relocation ActAmendments of 1987 require that implementing regulations under it bearan effective date no later than two years after enactment, which is April2, 1989. Accordingly, the Postal Service finds good cause, consistent withthe action of the rest of the Federal government, to put these regulationsinto effect within the April 2 deadline, notwithstanding the provisionsof the Administrative Procedure Act. For the reasons explained above, the Postal Service hereby amends 39 CFRas follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 777</ITAG>Real property acquisition, Relocation assistance.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 777_RELOCATION ASSISTANCE AND REAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION POLICIES</ITAG>1.
