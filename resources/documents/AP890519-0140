Tehran's move came less than a year after the Iran Air jet washit by two American missiles and exploded thousands of feet abovethe Persian Gulf. All passengers and crew perished in the July 3,1988, incident.   Iran's fundamentalist government has asked the court to rulethat ``the government of the United States is responsible to paycompensation to the Islamic Republic, to the amount to bedetermined by the court, as measured by the injuries suffered bythe Islamic Republic and the bereaved families.''   A copy of Iran's request, which was filed Wednesday, wasobtained by The Associated Press.   Iran did not provide an estimate of the damage suffered,according to E. Safavi, a spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in TheHague.   At the time of the incident, President Reagan offeredcompensation to relatives of the victims, but he ruled out any rolefor the Iranian government in settling damage claims.   It was not immediately known whether the Bush Administration wasplanning to take part in the proceedings.   Thomas Hodges, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here, said, ``Acopy of the Iranian application was sent to the secretary of statein Washington where it is being studied.'' He declined furthercomment.   On Friday, the World Court was considering when to proceed withthe case. Hearings do not begin until arguments have been filed inwriting _ a process that usually takes months.   The World Court is the judicial branch of the United Nations.Officially known as the International Court of Justice, it has noenforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to itsrulings.   The crew of the Vincennes erroneously identified an Iranianpassenger Airbus plane as an Iranian air force F-14 fighter planeand shot it down.   Iran's application to the World Court charges the United Stateshas violated an international treaty on terrorism against airplanes_ the 1971 Geneva Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful ActsAgainst the Safety of Civil Aviation.   It is the second case in a decade pitting the United Statesagainst Iran at the World Court.   Ten years ago, the Carter administration filed suit against Iranover the fate of 55 American diplomats held hostage at the U.S.Embassy in Tehran _ the affair which made Washington breakrelations with Tehran.   Iran, which did not appear in court, was ordered to immediatelyrelease the hostages. Tehran ignored the ruling. The hostagesultimately were freed in January 1980 after an elaborate deal wasnegotiated with the help of Algeria.   The United States withdrew from proceedings in the other majorWorld Court case in which it was involved in 1984, when Nicaraguasought a halt to U.S. support for the rebels known as Contras.   Only days before the complaint was filed, the Reaganadministration canceled its acceptance of World Court jurisdictionin Central American affairs. The court sided with the Sandinistagovernment two years later.   Only 49 of the 159 U.N. member nations have accepted the court'sauthority as compulsory in settling conflicts between states. TheUnited States is one of them.</TEXT></DOC>
