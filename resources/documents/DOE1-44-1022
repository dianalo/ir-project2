Loading diagramsand the necessary calculation formulae are given. The method allows loadingfrom one storage bin while the other bins are being replenished. In thisway up to three coal sizes can be handled at a single railway track andthe size of the mine railway station can be reduced. In this case, however,the storage bins should be equipped with reliable level indicators, electronicweight indicators and strain gauge weighing sensors.</TEXT></DOC>
