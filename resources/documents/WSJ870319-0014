California state regulators closed the Santa Ana, Calif., thrift, and the Bank Board transferred its operations to Perpetual Savings Association, a newly chartered federal mutual association that will maintain the failed thrift's offices.    The Bank Board attributed the thrift's failure to losses resulting from speculative real estate investments. The thrift had assets of $61.9 million as of Jan. 31.    The new thrift will be run for the Bank Board under a management contract with Great American First Savings Bank, San Diego. </TEXT></DOC>
