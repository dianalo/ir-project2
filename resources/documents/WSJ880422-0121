Perry and David Rogers (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> PHILADELPHIA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson's extraordinary campaign, derailed in New York, faces a tough time getting back on track here in Pennsylvania.    Pennsylvania's primary next Tuesday won't be easy for either Gov. Michael Dukakis or Mr. Jackson, the two remaining players in this nomination drama, for this is a tough, hard-bitten place. But Mr. Dukakis, playing with cool and calm precision, is holding most of the cards. &quot;Pennsylvania is a hard place for Jesse Jackson,&quot; concedes Scott Nova, a Jackson campaign spokesman.    Mr. Jackson himself seems to realize how the campaign is shifting. &quot;Don't you be discouraged,&quot; he cries out to supporters at a rally here in JFK Plaza, in center city. &quot;Hold your heads high. Help is on the way. We've come a mighty long way. We will press forward.&quot;    Campaigning in Williamsport, he tells high-school students, &quot;Don't shrug your shoulders. Don't surrender.&quot; He sometimes seems to be talking as much to himself as to his audiences. As his fortunes sag, he sounds more and more like an echo of Martin Luther King, his mentor, offering reassurance during adversity.    With so many campaign days behind him, so many stirring speeches delivered at a full shout, Mr. Jackson is losing his voice -- and some of his swagger. Without conceding defeat, he and his people are quietly reverting to speaking of the campaign more as a movement to influence the Democratic Party than as a candidacy they think can succeed.    On the record, they still insist that Mr. Jackson can keep close to Mr. Dukakis here in Pennsylvania, and in succeeding contests in Ohio and Indiana, and fight on finally to a great victory in California in June. &quot;Jesse's been knocked out of the box so many times before,&quot; says City Councilman George Burrell, a Jackson supporter. &quot;He always comes back.&quot; But Mr. Burrell, a onetime defensive back for the Denver Broncos, seems to be bracing for a Dukakis triumph.    Mr. Burrell and other black voters nevertheless are enthusiastic about the Jackson candidacy. They will turn out in big numbers to vote for him in the meaningless &quot;beauty contest&quot; and for his delegates in those congressional districts where the Jackson forces have fielded slates.    But even the black voters at the Jackson rally at JFK Plaza seem a little subdued. They listen attentively, but show almost none of the raw emotion Mr. Jackson usually has ignited in his campaign appearances.    It was even less encouraging for Gov. Dukakis when he came here last Tuesday, hours before his decisive triumph in the New York primary, to address the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in a cavernous ballroom of a downtown hotel. Not many people in the audience listened to him. They kept right on drinking and talking, mostly about local and state contests that will also be on the ballot Tuesday.    Interest is high among the party faithful here in determining the nominees for auditor general and for two seats on the appellate courts -- far higher than in who will be the next president.    Mr. Dukakis, barring a major upset, will carry the day. He is the only candidate with full delegate slates in all of Pennsylvania's 23 congressional districts. He was a staggering 39 points ahead of Mr. Jackson in the Pennsylvania Poll conducted by the Philadelphia Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and taken the weekend before the New York primary.    Mr. Jackson is expected to carry Philadelphia, picking up the delegates in two out of its three congressional districts. He may also carry Pittsburgh. That leaves 19 more congressional districts, and the going gets tough.    There isn't much for Mr. Jackson in eastern Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia and pockets of support in places like Chester and Harrisburg. So Mr. Jackson will cross the mountains and campaign hard in western Pennsylvania to woo working-class white voters, many of whom lost their jobs in the steel mills and the coal mines years ago. Particularly inspired, the Jackson schedulers believe, is a boat trip tomorrow down the Monongahela River, passing mile after mile of abandoned steel mills. &quot;It will be a metaphor of what this campaign is all about,&quot; says spokeswoman Janice Fine.    But these Pennsylvania blue-collar workers are older than blue collars in most other places. They have been out of work longer, and they may be somewhat more hard-bitten. Many of them are wary of the Rev. Mr. Jackson's brand of liberalism, as well as his race. &quot;They are oriented to a much more conservative vision of America,&quot; says Michael Birkner, a political historian at Millersville University near Lancaster. Many of these workers were exposed to radical tactics employed by a few clergymen who came into their communities when the mills were closing -- and they didn't like it. &quot;These ministers came in and instead of focusing on the issues, they derailed the struggle,&quot; says Michael Stout, a former steelworker and a Jackson supporter. Winning them back to &quot;the struggle&quot; won't be easy.    A number of labor leaders have endorsed Mr. Jackson, and some of the rank and file are coming around. In Erie, Michael Rehberg, an ironworker, watches with approval as Mr. Jackson, dressed as usual now in his blue, bulletproof raincoat, addresses a crowd of about 3,000 in Perry Square. &quot;Jackson's been saying no to drugs,&quot; Mr. Rehberg says, &quot;before Nancy Reagan began picking the White House china.&quot;    The numbers, though, are tough. To stay even close to Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Jackson, by his campaign's own reckoning, needs more than 25% of the white vote. That seems far beyond his reach.    The Dukakis campaign is well-financed, well-organized -- and dull. The message for Pennsylvania is industrial revitalization. &quot;Gov. Dukakis,&quot; says Lanny Johnson, the state director, &quot;has demonstrated an ability in Massachusetts to restore jobs in old industries and find new jobs in new industries. Our candidate's record can be examined,&quot; a not-so-subtle suggestion that Mr. Jackson has no record in elective office.    Dull the campaign may be, but it is also efficient. &quot;Palm cards&quot; are Pennsylvania's traditional political weapon. They are small sheets of paper easily held in the palm of the voter's hand to carry into the voting booth, and they are especially important here because in some multi-county districts, a delegate may run on Lever No. 5 in one county, lever No. 61 in another. The Dukakis campaign has printed county-by-county palm cards for every congressional district in the state, complete with photographs of the Dukakis delegates next to the levers on the voting machines that must be pulled to elect them.    ---                    Pennsylvania Profile    Population (1985)                           11,863,672     White                                      90%     Non-White                                  10%    Median age* (in years)                      32.1    Urban population percentage*                69.3%    Unemployment rate (March 1988)              5.1%    Biggest cities     Philadelphia (1985)                        1,647,566     Pittsburgh (1984)                          403,000   *1980 census figures   Sources: Pennsylvania State Data Center, U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Dept. of Labor   (Revised WSJ April 25, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
