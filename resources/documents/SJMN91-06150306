Well, because children need to see how connected our modern culture is tocultures of long ago, and this single day contains three separate links thattie all of us to the people of ancient Rome.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Extra 4  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CALENDAR DATES TO DAYS OF DEITIES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Family LearningDr. William F.

The name &quot;Saturday&quot; comesto us from the Latin words meaning &quot;Saturn's day,&quot; and honors one of theearliest Roman gods.;    Saturn was a god of agriculture, a protector offarmers, and was later thought of as the father of Jupiter, the king of theRoman gods.;    The month of June is generally considered to be named afterthe goddess Juno, the wife of Jupiter. Juno's duties included being thegoddess of marriage and the protectress of women, and so June became a favoredmonth for marriages even in the time of the Romans.;    Let's go through theother months and days very quickly before I get back to that thirdconnection.;    January -- The Roman god Janus watched over the beginnings andendings of events, and so January was (eventually) placed at the beginning ofthe year.;    February -- An ancient Roman religious ceremony was held at thistime of year. Leather thongs called &quot;februa&quot; were used as whips.;    March --Named for Mars, the Roman god of war. Originally, March was the first month ofthe year. The winter was over and so war could begin again.;    April -- Comesfrom the Latin word &quot;aperio,&quot; meaning &quot;open,&quot; which is what the flowers did atthis time of year.;    May -- Maia was one of the daughters of Atlas.;    July-- The Roman calendar used to have only 10 months. Mark Antony proposed thatthe fifth month (called &quot;Quintilis&quot;) be renamed &quot;Julius&quot; to honor the birthmonth of Caius Julius Caesar.;    August -- Formerly the sixth month(&quot;Sextilis&quot;), Julius's nephew changed the name to &quot;Augustus&quot; to honorhimself.;    September, October, November, December -- Originally the 7th,8th, 9th, and 10th months were named for the corresponding Latin numbers:septem, octo, novem, and decem.;    The days of the week honor the sun (Sundayis literally the &quot;sun's day&quot;) and the moon (Monday is the &quot;moon's day&quot;), andthe deities from Norse and Germanic mythology.;    Tuesday -- The name of theNorse god Tyr became Tiw in Old English, and &quot;Tiwesdaeg&quot; meant &quot;the day ofTiw.&quot;;    Wednesday -- The Germanic god Woden was a counterpart to the Romangod Mercury. &quot;Woden's day&quot; corresponds to &quot;Mercury's day&quot; in French (Mercredi)and Spanish (miercoles).;    Thursday -- Thor, the Norse god of thunder, ishonored by &quot;Thor's day.&quot;;    Friday -- The Norse goddess Frigg was the wife ofWoden and the mother of Thor. This is &quot;Frigg's day.&quot;;    And what about thatthird link to Saturday, June 1?;    Well, the Roman months had three fixedpoints. The &quot;ides&quot; were the 15th day in the months of March, April, June, andOctober (the soothsayer warned Julius Caesar &quot;Beware the ides of March&quot;), andthe 13th day of the other months.;    The &quot;nones&quot; (rhymes with &quot;bones&quot;) werethe ninth day before the ides. And, here it is, the first day of every monthwas called the &quot;calends,&quot; which in Latin was spelled &quot;calendae.&quot; Not only isthis the source of our word &quot;calendar,&quot; but we can trace that often-misspelledsecond &quot;a&quot; right back to its Latin origin.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  William F.
