It aims at providing appropriatedesign criteria and proposing reasons for the implementation of morequalified gas detection systems technologies. Criteria generally adoptedfor manned platforms, associating an alarm to the detection of gas, cannotbe extrapolated to unmanned platforms, especially when the topside isnot realised on the basis of a completely 'open' layout. The paper discussesreliability design criteria for manned platforms based on operation designexperience and discusses design improvements and reasons for the greaterreliability required from gas detection systems when applied to unmannedplatforms.</TEXT></DOC>
