(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole saidTuesday he thinks President Bush is doing a better job than his twopredecessors of dealing with a Mideast hostage crisis.   But the Kansas Republican also warned that if terrorists carryout their threat to murder hostage Joseph Cicippio, the UnitedStates will use military retaliation.   If Cicippio is murdered, ``All bets are off,'' Dole said. ``Thenyou would see a military response.''   Dole, at a news conference, praised Bush for using intensivediplomatic pressures from at least 12 nations in an attempt toresolve the situation that led to the apparent murder of hostageMarine Lt. Col. William Higgins by Muslim extremists in Lebanon.   The president ``is using every channel,'' said Dole, who said hewas briefed last week by the CIA. Among nations applying diplomaticpressure are Algeria, the Soviet Union, Iran and Israel, he said.   ``I really believe there is some optimism,'' Dole said. ``I'vetalked to the president about this a number of times.''   He attributed his optimism to Bush's steady approach and themore moderate tone adopted by Iran's new president.   Dole earlier had criticized Israel for not notifying the UnitedStates that it planned to abduct a Shiite Muslim cleric from hishome in South Lebanon. He didn't repeat that criticism Tuesday,saying instead he thinks ``the Israelis are under some pressure.''</TEXT></DOC>
