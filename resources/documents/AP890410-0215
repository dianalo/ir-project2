(AP) _ A complete guide to state fishing records isnow available from an Athens publisher.   ``Henderson's Guide to Freshwater andamp; Saltwater State Game FishRecords,'' published by Outdoor Statistical Resources, lists staterecords for freshwater fish from all 50 states and saltwaterrecords from all coastal states except Hawaii, Maine and Oregon,which keep no such records.   Rankings are listed for each state by species of fish. The bookalso indicates which state records are world records. --_   One easy way to mess up a fishing trip is to get a hook caughtin an arm, leg or other part of your anatomy.   There's a relatively simple way to get the hook out without atrip to the doctor _ all you need is some ice, a bit of relativelystrong fishing line and some antiseptic.   It will hurt _ but not that badly _ and with after a quick patchjob, you'll be ready to continue fishing.   Here's how to do it, according to the people at Mercury Marine.   If the hook is attached to a lure, remove the lure. Then packsome ice over the wound to both numb the area and reduce bleeding.   Tie a loop in the fish line and place the loop around the backof your wrist. Run the loop out to your hand between the thumb andforefinger.   Put the other end of the loop over the hook and snug it againstthe inside bend. Then use your thumb to apply pressure on the eyeof the hook, down against the skin.   The pressure both steadies the hook and aligns the barb with theentry hole. Pushing down on the eye also spreads the wound open andthe barb will come out without tearing as much skin.   While keeping pressure on the hook, give the line a quick jerk.The hook should pop out.   Then rinse the cut in clean water, apply antiseptic and abandage, then go back after the big one. --_   Your casting will be in trouble if you put the line on your reelpoorly. The line could twist and tangle.   The American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association suggeststhe following steps to fill a reel.   Revolving spool, or level-wind, reels:   Insert a pencil or short stick through the hole in the supplyspool. Have another person hold both ends of the stick and keep alittle pressure on the spool.   The line should come off the top of the supply spool and in overthe top of the reel. Fill to within one-eighth inch of the lip onthe reel.   Spinning reels:   Attach the reel to a rod and string the line from the supplyspool down through the guides. Open the bail and tie the line tothe spool. Then flip the bail closed.   Have another person hold the rim of the supply spool so it willspiral off the supply spool in the same coil direction as you wantit to go onto the reel spool.   This prevents line twist as you wind on the line.   Holding the rod tip several feet from the supply spool, tensethe line between the thumb and forefinger of your rod-holding hand.Wind on several turns of line. If the line is coming from thecorrect side of the supply spool, it will spiral off in open, loosecoils.   If not, it soon will begin to twist. If this occurs, turn thesupply spool around. Fill the reel to slightly below the spool lip.   Closed-faced spincast reels:   Use the same methods as for open-face reels, except remove thenosecone and hold it slightly in front of the reel while winding onthe line. That way you can see when the spool is filled to theproper level, slightly before the spool lip.   Be sure to properly dispose of your old line. If you throw itinto the water, it can kill fish or other marine life. --_   Hardwick, Vt. (AP) _ A computer course has been added to theactivities for blind and visually impaired children at CampWapanacki, one of the country's oldest camps devoted to theirinterests.   Campers between the ages of 6 and 21 can learn computer skillsalong with swimming, sail boarding, canoeing, rowing, camping, artsand crafts and the performing arts at the Wapanacki, operated bythe New York Institute for Special Education. The camp also isoffering a special session for blind adults and their families.   Vicky Tripodi, the camp director, says many of the campers livein urban areas, so the summer program offers them a chance to getoutdoors and exercise.

Made by Porta-Bote International of Moutain View, Calif., a newseries of boats features models that fold to a thickness of 4''.One can be strapped to the top of your car like a surfboard.   The boats come in 8', 10' and 12' models and weigh about half asmuch as comparable aluminum boats. --=   Oxygen-based chemicals offer an alternative to chlorine fortreating swimming pool water, according to Du Pont, which makesoxidizers for use in new pool shocking systems.   The systems can be a boon to chlorine-sensitive swimmers, theirhair and their swimwear, Du Pont says. Water can be treated in 15minutes without danger of underuse or overuse. The company says theoxidizing systems also work in pools sanitized with bromine,destroy organic contaminants and help prevent formation of combinedchlorine, or chloramines. --=</TEXT></DOC>
