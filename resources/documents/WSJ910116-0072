By a 5-3 vote, the justices for the first time set a legalstandard to guide federal courts faced with a growing numberof requests by school boards to end court-ordered busing andother facets of desegregation plans. The justices said thecourts should end supervision if school boards have complied&quot;in good faith&quot; and eliminated the &quot;vestiges of pastdiscrimination . . . to the extent practicable.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the rulingdidn't openly retreat from the principle of the 1954 landmarkdecision, Brown vs. Board of Education, that school districtsmust eliminate the effects of segregation policies. But itsignaled that the era of continuous federal court scrutiny ofschool desegregation plans may be drawing to a close.   Civil rights lawyers viewed the ruling as sending &quot;mixedsignals,&quot; according to Janell Byrd, a lawyer with the NAACPLegal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. &quot;It's not a fullretreat from Brown,&quot; she said. But she complained that thecourt sent the case, an appeal by Oklahoma City schoolofficials, back to the federal district court for furtheraction. &quot;We think we already met the court's test in (this)case,&quot; she said.   Civil rights lawyers said that the ruling is likely toencourage those school districts that are bridling underfederal court supervision but that the precise effects won'tbe known until federal district and appeals courts begin toapply the new standard.   August Steinhilber, general counsel of the National SchoolBoards Association, said, &quot;Local school districts will stillhave to go to court and prove that they have met thestandard, which is not going to be an easy chore.&quot;   A major question that wasn't entirely resolved is howfederal courts should address so-called resegregation, when aschool system that was desegregated under a court orderbegins to have one-race schools again, a common development.School officials usually claim resegregation is the result ofchanging housing patterns over which they have no control.Civil rights lawyers generally argue that it is the result ofresidential segregation that was a side effect of the schoolboard's earlier segregation.   The high court said federal courts should consider there-emergence of one-race schools in deciding whether to endcourt-ordered busing. It emphasized that school districts areconstitutionally required to eliminate only the effects ofofficial segregation. That means districts aren't obliged toeliminate one-race schools that result from other causes,such as changing housing patterns, and may give a green lightto greater use of neighborhood school assignments.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall, joinedby Justices Harry Blackmun and John Stevens, warned that themajority didn't pay sufficient attention to the effects ofnew one-race schools. Justice Marshall, who as a lawyerargued the Brown case, said, &quot;Our cases have imposed . . . aduty to eliminate any condition that perpetuates the messageof racial inferiority inherent in the policy ofstate-sponsored segregation. The racial identifiability of adistrict's schools is such a condition.&quot;   But the chief justice's opinion emphasized other factors.&quot;Federal supervision of local school systems was intended asa temporary measure to remedy past discrimination,&quot; the chiefjustice wrote. &quot;Such decrees . . . are not intended tooperate in perpetuity.&quot; The majority decision alsohighlighted the importance of local school control, which&quot;allows citizens to participate in decision-making and allowsinnovation so that school programs can fit local needs.&quot;   Much of the effect may depend on the course that the Bushadministration pursues in the wake of the ruling. The JusticeDepartment is involved in an estimated 500 schooldesegregation cases. William Taylor, a civil rights lawyerhere, said, &quot;If the administration actively encourages schooldistricts to go back to court, or if the Justice Departmentitself goes back to court, then this decision will have amajor adverse impact on school desegregation. If they take amore moderate approach,&quot; he said, &quot;there are many schooldistricts that aren't anxious to reopen these cases.&quot;   Justice Department officials declined to comment on theschool desegregation decision, saying they were stillreviewing the opinion.   Justice David Souter didn't participate in the decisionbecause the case was argued before he joined the court.   The Oklahoma City case began in 1961 with a lawsuit byblack students and parents. In 1972, finding that schoolboard efforts in response to the lawsuit had failed, afederal court imposed a school desegregation plan. In 1977,the court concluded the plan was working and ended its closesupervision. In 1984, the school board proposed significantchanges to accommodate shifting housing patterns. That led tothe reopening of the case, and after much legal maneuvering,the court ruled in 1987 that the schools should be returnedentirely to local control, free of court supervision.   But in 1989, an appeals court in Denver ruled that thelegal standard for ending a court injunction required thatthe court order remain in effect unless the school boardproved a &quot;grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseenconditions.&quot; The appeals court blocked any changes in thefederal court order.   The high court reversed the appeals court's decision,saying the standard for ending an injunction was toostringent for school desegregation cases. The court sent thecase back to the district court to apply the new standard.   The court also is likely soon to send several other casesthat it has been holding for the Oklahoma City decision backto lower courts to apply the new standard. These casesinvolve desegregation plans in Topeka, Kan., site of theoriginal Brown case, as well as Denver and Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
