For the first time, Communist leaders have offered to negotiatewith an independent, popular opposition movement on the structure ofpolitical and social freedoms affecting the entire society.   Unlike 1980 talks with Solidarity, authorities now openly saythey want to discuss ways to legalize opposition to the governmentand to institutionalize a parliamentary opposition that wouldtransform the party-dominated system.   The talks would cover trade unions, Solidarity's first goal.   But the subjects of other independent associations and clubs,elections, freedom of the press and constitutional changes also areexpected at talks on Poland's future.   Even the normally skeptical Solidarity leader Lech Walesa seemedimpressed and said he was surprised by the document on trade unionand political freedoms issued after a tumultuous party CentralCommittee meeting last week.   ``It has never happened in the party before. It will meanbreaking the monopoly (on power),'' Walesa said of the document'sstrong endorsement of economic, political and social pluralism.   Solidarity's National Executive Committee on Sunday agreed thegovernment's expression of willingness to legalize the trade unionfederation removed the last obstacle to talks with authorities. ASolidarity spokesman said the talks should start ``very soon.''   But much skepticism remains in Solidarity ranks, based on pastexperience. The union had a signed agreement with the government inAugust 1980 guaranteeing its right to exist. But the accord provedmeaningless when Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski called outhis troops and interned thousands of Solidarity members in a Dec.13, 1981, crackdown.   Now there are suspicions the government wants a new accord onlyto calm a huge wave of public unrest that appears to be buildingafter yet another year of steep inflation and constant shortages.   Polish living standards dropped sharply in the early 1980s andstill have not climbed back to the level of a decade ago.   Walesa warned in a television debate in November that Poland isin danger of falling further and further behind the rest of Europe.   He argues for labor calm because widespread strikes would harmthe economy. At the same time, Walesa stresses that the union musthave the right to strike and says he will not sign any agreement atthe cost of Solidarity's independence.   A government source demanding anonymity said authorities arecounting on Solidarity to keep the peace and expressed confidencethat if the union and authorities form a partnership, they will keepfactories calm and give planned economic reforms a chance to work.   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity's national spokesman, said Sundaythe union ``will not be pushed into the role of the police or a firebrigade'' to put out strikes.   But he added, ``We want to discuss economic reform. ... If itworks then there will be no need to make a general strike.''   The dramatic change of course by Polish authorities can beexplained in several ways.   In addition to the specter of strikes larger than the two wavesof labor unrest that shocked authorities last year, there has been agrowing consensus _encouraged by Poland's powerful Roman CatholicChurch _ that the country will never move forward without compromisebetween the government and opposition.   Some credit must go to Walesa's performance on a nationwidetelevision debate in November. While coming out strongly forreinstating Solidarity, he convinced authorities he is a responsibleleader not seeking to plunge Poland into confrontation.   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said the government'spolling data after the debate showed a significant increase insupport for both the government and Solidarity.   This was not paradoxical, he said. Agreement could prove apopular and beneficial policy for both sides.   Among rank-and-file Solidarity activists, there is eagerness toget started again.   ``Everyone is ready for it,'' said Andrzej Durzynski, a unionmember from Solidarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk.   ``It won't be necessary to create Solidarity anew, simply toreactivate it.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John Daniszewski is the Warsaw-basedcorrespondent of The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
