Foreign investors' purchases of U.S. stocks, bonds,companies and real estate plummeted $121.4 billion in 1990 toa total of $48.9 billion, according to the SecuritiesIndustry Association, a trade group.</LP><TEXT>   This diminished amount of capital flowing into thecountry, plus rising interest rates abroad, kept U.S.interest rates at higher levels than they would have been&quot;during a period of economic weakness,&quot; said Nicholas P.Sargen, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.   This underpinning of rates worked against the FederalReserve's attempts to stimulate economic growth as therecession began in the fourth quarter of last year. The Fedcut interest rates repeatedly, and may do so again, butrecessionary conditions persist.   Mr. Sargen added that the reduced capital flows into theU.S. &quot;were a major factor behind the dollar's 17% fallagainst European currencies in 1990.&quot; A falling dollar hasmixed effects on the U.S., spurring exports of U.S. goods butadding to inflationary pressures.   Because the U.S. recession is expected to end sometimethis year and the dollar already is strengthening,foreigners' appetites for U.S. investments should pick upagain, analysts predict. But total capital inflows in 1991may not return to 1989 levels, they warn.   Foreigners sold a record net $15.3 billion of U.S. stockslast year, compared with net purchases of $9.9 billion in1989, according to the SIA. At the same time, foreign privateinvestors unloaded $4.3 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, notesand bills; in 1989, by contrast, they added $27.4 billion ofthem to their portfolios.   Foreign central banks bought $24.1 billion of U.S.government securities last year, primarily to park thedollars they bought to support the sinking currency, saidDavid G. Strongin, the SIA's director of internationalfinance.   Foreigners' net purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds(Treasury, agency and corporate), totaled only $23.2 billionin 1990, the lowest amount since 1983 and a more thanfour-fold decline from $98.1 billion in 1989.   Meanwhile, U.S. investors stepped up their buying offoreign securities to a net $30.8 billion from $19.1 billionin 1989. The increased American appetite for overseas stocksand bonds in addition to the diminished foreign taste forU.S. securities meant that the U.S. suffered a net portfoliooutflow for the first time since 1974, according to the SIA.   The factors that turned foreigners away from U.S. marketsand drew Americans overseas were similar: a slowing U.S.economy and falling U.S. interest rates, coupled with morevigorous economic growth and rising rates abroad; the largeU.S. budget deficit; and apprehension over the vulnerabilityof the U.S. financial system.   &quot;Overseas interest rates rose above those in the U.S. forthe first time in 15 years,&quot; said Mr. Sargen of SalomonBrothers. &quot;That was a key element in diminishing the allureof the U.S. bond market to foreign investors.&quot;   Lawrence A. Veit, an international economist at BrownBrothers Harriman andamp; Co., said that to many foreigners, &quot;theU.S. looked like a place where you ran the risk of assuminghigher risk with a lower rate of return&quot; as recessionapproached and corporate profits fell. In addition, he said,&quot;people were also worried about a recurrence of anotherVietnam in the {Persian} Gulf.&quot;   Last year, British investors sold the most U.S. stocks --$3.1 billion -- closely followed by the Japanese and Swiss($2.9 billion each) and oil exporting countries ($2.4billion). &quot;The sell-off was so complete that none of thecountries analyzed in the {SIA's report} made net purchases,&quot;said Mr. Strongin. &quot;Indeed, investors from France,Switzerland and the U.K. were net sellers in each quarter of1990.&quot;   The slowing economy and poor corporate profit outlook alsocontributed to a decline in foreign acquisitions of U.S.companies and real estate. Total direct investment fellnearly 65% to $25.7 billion from $72.2 billion.   In contrast to the gloomy outlook in the U.S., investorsworld-wide became enamored with German unification, higherGerman interest rates and a strengthening mark. Also,&quot;domestic financial instability in Japan requiredretrenchment on the part of Japanese institutional investors;some of them sold U.S. assets in order to have more yen tomeet their domestic needs,&quot; said Mr. Veit.   &quot;The era of huge Japanese capital outflows came to anend,&quot; said Mr. Sargen. Many &quot;Japanese institutional investorshad achieved what they considered an appropriately high levelof diversification into foreign assets.&quot; Japanese investorssold more than $17 billion of U.S. securities in 1990.   This year, analysts expect foreigners to be drawn to astrengthening dollar and a U.S. economic recovery, whileeconomies overseas slow and interest rates abroad decline.</TEXT></DOC>
