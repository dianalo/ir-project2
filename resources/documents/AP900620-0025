WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The future of the National Endowment for theArts, clouded by political furor over works of art deemedoffensive, will be fought out on the floor of the House.   A House committee voted Tuesday to kick the issue to the fullHouse in a move that acknowledged the panel was unable to resolvedeep divisions over whether and how to restructure the federal artsagency.   At issue is a bill continuing the NEA for another five years,without any restrictions on grants and controversial works of art.The bill was proposed by the Bush administration, but the WhiteHouse has been negotiating with Republicans in Congress to come upwith acceptable restrictions on the agency's grant-making authority.   Its House sponsor, Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said he opposesany restrictions but expects the House will add them. Even withoutthem, he said, the political furor has had a chilling effect on theNEA's grant process.   ``Chances are less than 50-50 that the bill will pass the Houseas it is now written, with regard to content restrictions,''Williams said.   ``Regardless of what happens on the bill, the NEA may never bethe same,'' he said.   The House Education and Labor Committee voted by voice toapprove the administration's bill, but leaders said the intent wassimply to postpone the debate.   The full House probably will consider the bill in mid-July, saidSpeaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. It will also consider severalproposed amendments that would restructure the arts agency orimpose restrictions against support for pornographic, sacrilegiousor other offensive art.   ``Every reasonable issue ought to be considered by the House,''Foley said.   The follows a year of political controversy inflamed by a seriesof disclosures of seemingly offensive art that received federalsubsidies.   In the latest, The Washington Times reported Tuesday that a$9,000 NEA grant went to a non-profit group in San Francisco thatis sponsoring a homoerotic movie festival.   Some advocates of restrictions warned that without them,political support for the NEA would evaporate and Congress couldkill the agency entirely.   ``There is a responsibility that comes with the expenditure offederal dollars,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``The issue isnot censorship but sponsorship.''   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, a former television actor, defendedthe NEA and said only a few grants out of thousands turned out bad.He said adding any restrictions could damage artistic excellence.   ``I'm far more concerned about mediocrity than I ampornography,'' Grandy said.   Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., distributed a proposed amendment hedrafted after negotiations with NEA officials and the White House.   It calls on the agency to ensure it supports art ``which issensitive to the nature of public sponsorship, and does notdeliberately denigrate the cultural heritage of the United States,its religious traditions or racial and ethnic groups.''   Money could not go to art that violates ``prevailing standardsagainst obscenity or indecency.''   Some conservatives have proposed more restrictive language onpornography. Another group of Republicans is proposing arestructuring of the NEA that would send more federal moneydirectly to state arts agencies for distribution.</TEXT></DOC>
