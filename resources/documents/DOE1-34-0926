The output was increased from 1 KW to 10 KW by 1986, andthe electrode area doubled from 800 cm{sup 2} to 1,600 cm{sup 2}. Problemin increasing the number of cells is the combination of series and parallelarrangement; aiming at a high efficiency cell, the number of serial laminationwas limited at 24 cells with 12 stack para connection, considering theshort circuit current loss. As a result, the efficiency attained (71.1%)was higher than the target value of 70% together with satisfactory resultsin other points. 50 KW class will be started to be developed in 1987with such targets as the enhancement of safety and reliability and energydensity, less frequent complete discharge, and the cost reduction.
