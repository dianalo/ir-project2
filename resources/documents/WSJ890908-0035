In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.9800 marks and 146.63 yen, up from 1.9755 marks and 146.15 yen Wednesday. The pound fell to $1.5512 from $1.5525.    In Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 146.20 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 146.65 yen.    In early European trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted as high as 1.9935 marks and 147.35 yen. A combination of central-bank intervention and profit-taking initially brought it off those highs.    Late in New York activity, the dollar fell further -- nearly a pfennig and almost half a yen -- on what some traders said were some large sell orders in relatively thin markets. That drop then snowballed as nervous traders scrambled to lock in profits.    Nonetheless, &quot;net, net, the dollar is still a buy,&quot; said Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan Bank's New York foreign-exchange operation.    The immediate explanation for the dollar's rise was an early belief that the West German central bank wouldn't raise key interest rates at its scheduled meeting yesterday and then the announcement that in fact it didn't.    Analysts said the dollar remains bolstered by a U.S. economy that is more robust than many had thought earlier and a growing belief that the Federal Reserve won't lower U.S. interest rates soon. Higher interest rates usually increase a currency's allure to international investors, traders and speculators.    If the dollar remains near its current levels -- many analysts at the start of the year predicted it would be as much as 25% lower than its current levels -- it could impede international efforts to reduce further the large U.S. trade deficit. That is because a resilient U.S. currency makes U.S. exports more expensive and reduces the cost of imports.    A stronger dollar, however, also helps retard the growth of U.S. inflation by keeping import costs down as well as those of U.S. products that compete with imports.    In many ways, yesterday's activity was a replay of Tuesday's: currency markets tried to push the dollar above two marks; central banks sold the dollar when it was trading near 1.99 marks; the market retreated a bit on the intervention and profit-taking, yet the U.S. currency finished relatively strong.    On Wednesday, the dollar declined amid apprehension that the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan might raise key interest rates, thus increasing the attraction of mark- and yen-denominated investments.    Despite the ability of the central banks to keep the dollar below the two mark level, &quot;by next week we'll surely see two marks,&quot; predicted Marcus Croonen, a dealer at DG Bank in Frankfurt, West Germany. &quot;The market is too bullish at the moment. Everyone wants to see two marks; they want to test it.&quot;    Even so, he and many other traders and analysts say the U.S. currency's potential to rise far above either that level or 150 yen is limited. &quot;The central banks have the strength {to hold the dollar down}, but not at the moment,&quot; said Mr. Croonen. &quot;They will let the market see two marks, and then they will put the buck down.&quot;    While major central banks are concerned about the dollar's recent strength, they also appear to be taking its rise in stride. Traders described the dollar sales during the past few days as rather modest. For instance, they estimated that the Bank of Japan has sold an average of $200 million to $300 million in Far Eastern trading during the past three days, with roughly $400 million spent yesterday.    Those sums are a far cry from the more than $1 billion a day that traders said Japanese authorities spent trying to wrestle the dollar down during its last run-up in May and June.    Central banks could also resort to interest-rate maneuvers to lower the dollar. For instance, rate boosts in West Germany and Japan coupled with lower rates in the U.S. would reduce the dollar's appeal relative to that of the mark and yen. But each country has its own motive for relying solely on intervention at the moment.    &quot;Young people in the Bank of Japan would like to see interest rates a bit higher because of the higher dollar, but the senior people are more concerned about internal political matters,&quot; said Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief trader for Sanwa Bank in New York.    After suffering big losses in recent parliamentary elections and facing more elections by next summer, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, contend analysts, is reluctant to tamper with Japanese economic growth or risk upsetting domestic stock and bond markets by raising interest rates. Moreover, as a matter of policy, Japan tends not to raise or lower official interest rates as often as several of its major Western counterparts.    Thus, Mr. Sakaguchi said, &quot;They won't change the discount rate, but will let the market take up short-term rates.&quot;    While the mark is weak both against the dollar and higher-yielding European currencies, the Bundesbank prefers not to be forced to raise rates, analysts said. In addition, they said reduced commodity prices have somewhat mitigated the inflationary effects of a weak mark.    What's more, &quot;the threat of higher interest rates if the dollar moves up {further} is always in the armament of the Bundesbank,&quot; said Kenneth De La Salle, manager of foreign exchange at National Westminster Bank in London.    Noting that as long as there was still solid demand for the dollar, he said: &quot;It's pretty much senseless trying to turn a market where sentiment is quite strong.&quot; Yet Mr. De La Salle added: &quot;You don't have that hyped feeling; {the dollar's rise} is a steady movement, not a panic.&quot;    Later this year, West German industry and labor unions are scheduled to hold major wage negotiations. If it felt it was necessary, the Bundesbank could raise interest rates then, &quot;particularly if the exchange-rate situation would favor such a move,&quot; said Gisela Kurtz, an economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.    For its part, the U.S. sees the stronger dollar as damping inflation, contended some analysts. In addition, &quot;with the going dollar rate, Americans are able to serve world markets to the extent they want to and to the degree they have the capacity utilization to do it,&quot; said Ms. Kurtz. But &quot;as long as domestic demand is very high, American companies -- small and medium-sized corporations in particular -- won't turn to exports,&quot; she said.    Ms. Kurtz and others don't read these differing central-bank concerns as a sign of disagreement within the Group of Seven major industrial countries: the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    &quot;I don't feel there is a rupture in as much as they are concentrating on domestic stability in keeping inflation down, are averse to an extremely high dollar and wouldn't want very erratic {currency} fluctuations,&quot; she said.    While many analysts say the G-7 has sought to keep the dollar within a secret trading range of 1.70-1.90 marks and 120-140 yen, &quot;they aren't obligated to maintain a rigid range against all forces,&quot; said Ms. Kurtz. &quot;They are flexible and well they should be.&quot;    Because of this cooperation, many traders don't see the dollar climbing much above two marks. &quot;The two-mark level will most certainly bring the central banks into the market,&quot; said Mr. De La Salle of National Westminster. Other traders also pointed out that European portfolio managers tended to lock in profits on their U.S. investments by selling dollars when the currency rose above two marks.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $360.20 an ounce, down $1.40. Estimated volume was a light 1.6 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $359.35 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
