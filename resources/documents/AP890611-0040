The sophisticated systems, both on the market for the first timethis spring, were created by two American companies. The companieswere invited by the Federal Aviation Administration to show the newtechnology during the 10-day gathering at Le Bourget airport northof Paris.   In recent years, searches, metal detectors and X-ray machineshave become routine at airports and the number of hijackings hasdeclined. But passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices.   It takes less than a pound of plastic explosive, the size of achocolate bar, to bring down a jumbo jet. The deadly material can bemolded into shapes that are easy to hide.   Such an explosive hidden in a casette tape player is believed tohave caused the death of 275 passengers aboard the Pan Am jet downedover the Scottish village of Lockerbee in December.   Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass., came up with a ``sniffer'' thatdetects chemical vapors. The $125,000 hand-held sniffer, calledEGIS, is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules,called algorithms.   ``If you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attemptedbombing, in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraftcabin,'' said Thermedics President John W. Wood Jr. ``Thisillustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags as well aschecked luggage.''   Thermedics has developed a second sniffer that is about a yearaway from the markeplace. It is called SecurScan and works on thesame principle as EGIS but is designed as a walk-through chambersimilar to the now common metal detector.   A second new device is being shown by Science InternationalApplications Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. Their apparatus is calleda thermal neutron activation, or TNA and sells for $900,000.   Baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it isshowered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen, thechemical emitted by virtually all explosives. The reaction producesa scattering of gamma rays, a sort of chemical fingerprint that isanalyzed by a computer.   Six units have been purchased by the FAA for installation at NewYork's Kennedy Airport and London's Gatwick and 12 others will beinstalled in high-risk airports in the United States and overseas.   Meanwhile, thousands of visitors to the airshow cast their eyesskyward over Le Bourget airport Sunday to watch the firstdemonstration flight by a Soviet MiG-29 since the crash of anidentical fighter last week.   The camouflage-green fighter, emblazoned with a red star flewloops and spins in the blue sky, its engines spitting pale fire.   The sister MiG-29 crashed just after the opening of the air showon Thursday, but pilot Anatoly Kvochur managed to eject from theplane at 500 feet.</TEXT></DOC>
