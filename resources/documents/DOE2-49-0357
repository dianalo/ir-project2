Approximately 800 vehicles were maintainedat the center each year with about 100 brake jobs being needed duringthat course of time. Exposure to asbestos may occur during cleaning,maintenance, and repair of brakes. Workers were encouraged to use goodwork practices including the complete water rinsing and wet-bristle brushingof all exposed parts prior to handling, gently removing and handlingall parts, consistently using all required personal protective equipment,and following instructions for use of asbestos-control devices. Annualphysical examinations were provided for workers performing vehicularbrake-repair services. The author concludes that the facility did notappear to have asbestos controls sufficient to protect the workers fromasbestos dust arising from service operations. The advisability of conductingan in depth evaluation of the controls at the facility will be made inthe future, after all the preliminary surveys and finalization of theprotocol for the project has been reached.</TEXT></DOC>
