Quite often, conditions resulting from driftmotions or auxiliary heating of the plasma given rise to a non-Maxwelliandistribution function. This circumstance strongly influences the heattransport by ions in the tokamak. The possibility arises of directlystudying the ions distribution function in a tokamak, rather than simplystudying properties averaged over the entire distribution, such as theion temperature. The capabilities of various diagnostic methods for studyingions in a tokamak are examined from this point of view. Among these diagnosticmethods are analyzing the flux of charge-exchange atoms, measuring theflux of neutrons, analyzing the neutron energy spectrum, and measuringthe Doppler broadening of the spectral lines of ion and atoms. Some experimentalresults which illustrate the possibilities of a study of the ion distributionfunction in space, in energy, and in velocity space are reported.</TEXT></DOC>
