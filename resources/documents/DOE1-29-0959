They consider thediscrete phase retrieval problem as a special case of a more generalproblem which consists of recovering a real-valued signal x from themagnitude of the output of a linear distortion: vertical bar Hx verticalbar (j), j=1,...,n. The problems of the existence of a solution for phaseretrieval, conditioning of the problem and stability of the (essentially)unique solution are addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
