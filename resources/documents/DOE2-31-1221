Thispaper is aimed at discussing the differential diagnosis, with a specialemphasis on the pathogenesis of the syndrome. The phenomenon of air trappingin absence of central bronchial lesions is a typical radiographic finding.Chest X-ray is performed in both inspiration and expiration. Posterioroblique tomography at 55 grade centigrade of the effected side is alsoperformed. Diffuse bronchiolitis obliterans in infancy or early childhoodia widely accepted pathogenetic pattern. Pulmonary hypoventilation causesvasoconstriction and underdevelopment of pulmonary vessels, that arereduced in caliber. Differential diagnosis includes all the diseasesresulting in pulmonary hyperlucency, i.e. pulmonary and pleural alterations,and skeletal anomalies. 28 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
