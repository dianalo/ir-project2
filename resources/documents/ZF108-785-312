 Only nowhave those plans come to fruition.andP;  Although Apple has released two previousversions of Unix, it is this version-A/UX 2.0-that finally sports thefamiliar, accessible Macintosh interface that users have come to know andlove.andM;However, AJUX's consistency with the Macintosh interface is only a singleissue.andP;  The very idea of bringing Mac and Unix together carries a number oframifications-from speculation about the timing and relevance of the currentproduct, to the integration of a proprietary and an open operating system, tothe implementation of standards, to architectural coexistence, to networkingstrategies, to X Window's dominance in the Unix market, right down to thebasic philosophic differences between Macintosh and Unix aficionados.andM;Fortunately, Apple hasn't ignored these issues, although we can't honestlysay that all of them have been fully addressed.andP;  The company's goal is tomake A/UX the Unix desktop platform of choice.andP;  A/UX supports almost 200existing Mac desktop applications, and Apple is riding that fact as amarketing vehicle.andP;  Rightly so.andP;  Mac applications tend to be the sort ofdesktop applications that users need (as opposed to the techie applicationsthat pervade Sun or Digital Ultrix workstations).andP;  Yet, the proprietarynature of the Mac Toolbox limits the product to a certain degree.andP;  In thisarticle, we'll examine both the limitations and the scope of Apple's Unix interms of its role in the marketplace, technical design, and usability.andM;A Rocky Road but Worth the Wait A/UX 2.0 is a solid implementation of Apple'sUnix strategy.andP;  It is a highly functional and seemingly stable system.andP;  It'salso more open than you might imagine-with support for X Window and Motif(yes, Motif, although only through a third party), Posix standards, BSD 4.3,NFS, and TCP/IP.andP;  Its familiar graphical interface makes the system an idealstandalone processor.andP;  Yet, it provides sufficient connections also to makeit ideal as a client in a distributed network environment as well.andM;Most of the challenges Apple faces with A/UX are in overcoming its tarnishedimage.andP;  A/UX has been plagued during its evolution, most notably by itshighly-publicized inferior first release.andP;  Of course, some of this wasself-induced by Apple.andP;  A/UX was first announced at UniForum during JohnSculley's keynote address-quite a splashy announcement, and one that mightbest have waited until the product was more mature.andM;As is the case with most first software releases, the original A/UX wasbuggy.andP;  Developers told us that the system was slow and prone to crashes.andP;  Inaddition, it was difficult for developers to design applications on A/UXbecause Apple had not yet integrated the Mac Toolbox, a set of developmentresources for programmers creating Mac-conformant applications.andP;  Furthermore,A/UX offered only the Unix system shell interface-not exactly accommodating.andO;Needless to say, enthusiasm about the product faded.andP;  Had Apple at leastfilled the public in on the product's timetable, A/UX's first release mayhave had a better reception.andM;THE MERITS OF 1.1.andP;  Version 1.andP;  1, announced in January 1989, answered manyof the complaints of the first version-at least from the developer'sperspective.andP;  Its biggest advantage was the integration of the MacintoshToolbox.andP;  With the Toolbox in place, developers could create applicationsthat ran both in the AIUX and the Mac OS environments.andP;  In addition, 1.1provided more refined file transfer between Macintosh and A/UX file systems.andO;The product also featured X Window and Posix compliancy, BSD extensions, andsupport for LocalTalk and HyperCard.andM;Thereafter, we noted several independent software vendors (ISVS) who portedapplications to A/UX and were pleased with its performance.andP;  And not justcommercial developers such as Claris, in whose best interest it is to port toApple platforms.andP;  Companies such as Informix and WordPerfect have alsoincluded A/UX as a target platform.andM;A QUESTION OF TIMING.andP;  Although A/UX was initially released when the industrywas ripe for a graphical interface to Unix, it wasn't until the currentrelease that it adopted the Mac interface.andP;  In the meantime, X Window's twomost popular flavors-Motif and OpenLook-have become the primary contenders inthe Unix graphical user interface market.andP;  A/UX does support the X Windowsystem, but Apple isn't focusing on it (see &quot;Support for X Window&quot; below).andO;The A/UX credo is one of choice: X is there, but so is the Mac Toolbox, andApple is obviously championing it.andP;  While the Toolbox may have no problemattracting traditional Macintosh ISVS, many Unix application developers mightbe skeptical about considering yet another graphical user interface.andP;  Portingto multiple interfaces is simply too expensive, and the Mac interface cannotbe leveraged to other platforms.andM;Apple in the News.andP;  Ibis year's first quarter was a remarkable financialsuccess for Apple.andP;  This is especially impressive when you consider thenegative publicity Apple received earlier in the year-a 3 percent stafflayoff, a shake-up in upper management resulting in the resignation of SeniorVice President and Chief Technical Officer Jean-Louis Gasee, and an A/UX AirForce contract dispute (see  Marketing Focus&quot; below).andM;More recently, however, delays were reported of the much-anticipated Version7.0 of the Mactintosh operating system, and the announcement of MS-Windows3.0 may prove to detour Apple's marketing efforts.andP;  Apple has already begunlowering prices.andP;  Although these troubles have nothing to do with the qualityof A/UX, industry perception that a company has problems can weigh heavily indetermining the success of its products.andP;  Maybe A/UX 2.0 will help reversethat perception.andP;  So, too, may new Chief Operating Officer Mike Spindler.andO;Apparently, Spindler has made product timeliness a primary concern and hasput into effect a more practical, efficient approach to product developmentthan Apple is used to.andM;DISSENSION AMONG THE RANKS? It has been rumored that Apple hasn't exactlyembraced A/UX wholeheartedly.andP;  Friction within the company is understandablewhen you consider that the fundamental premises of Apple and Unix don't mesh.andO;Apple has always preached the strength of a proprietary, tightly-integratedsystem architecture, where interface and application functionality are rootedright down to die hardware.andP;  Unix, on the other hand, is detached fromhardware architectures.andP;  The Unix industry, based as it is in engineering andRandamp;D communities, is marked by an enthusiasm for standards and the sharing ofideas and technology.andM;Apple still considers itself a proprietary system vendor.andP;  Although thisrelease of A/UX may prove that die company is indeed serious about its Unixplatform, the system could definitely use some opening up (see &quot;A LimitedRole&quot; below).andP;  There is still some heavy debate at Apple about the precisedefinition of open systems.andM;The Strategy Apple's A/UX strategy is threefold:andM;* Provide the quintessential graphical user interface (GUI) forandM;the Unix market.andP;  Not many users who have used the MacandM;interface would argue with it.andP;  Therefore, the Mac ToolboxandM;provides Mac conventions for A/UX applications.andP;  By theandM;same token, not many Unix users would sit still for a userandM;interface that only runs on a single platform.andP;  Therefore,andM;Apple provides MacX, a Mac version of the X WindowandM;system.andP;  Motif is also available (although not directly fromandM;Apple; see &quot;A Choice of Window Managers&quot; below).andM;Supply multitasking from the A/UX desktop and the abilityandM;to mix and match applications from a variety of systems fromandM;Unix, to Mac, to X, to DOS, and, potentially, to OS/2.andM;A/UX supports MultiFinder, which provides cooperativeandM;multitasking of all Mac applications-both Mac OS andandM;A/UX.andP;  For DOS integration, the Mac uses SoftPC, and MacX provides access toX. AAJX Macintoshes offer pointand-click access to the Unix, DOS, and Macfile systems.andP;  Offer complete Unix integration with the Mac environment.andO;This goes beyond just A/UX and Mac integration.andP;  We've already touched on afew of the Unix standards A/UX supports (e.g., BSD, NFS, and TCP/IP).andP;  At anytime, you can open a Unix shell window from the desktop or run a System V orX-based application.andP;  The Mac and A/UX environments, however, have been veryclosely integrated.andP;  In fact, any 32bit shrink-wrapped Mac application canrun on A/UX platforms without any reconfiguring.andM;MARKETING FOCUS.andP;  Apple is tailoring A/UX Macintoshes as machines for averageusers, as opposed to high-end engineering workstations.andP;  The company statesthat it's marketing to federal agencies, higher education, technicalorganizations, and large corporations.andP;  This seems a little broad.andP;  AlthoughA/UX has access to a Unix system shell for hackers and graphics capabilitiesfor scientific researchers, its most probable customer candidates areeveryday end users who need to participate in a Unix environment or want ahigher-powered desktop system than a personal computer.andM;Although it's still early to measure the success of Apple's attempts tomarket to typical Unix shops, A/UX has been getting some attention fromuniversities and government agencies.andP;  For instance, Brown University'sInstitute for Research in Information Scholarship (IRIS) has recentlydeveloped an interesting product called IRIS Intermedia, a networkedhypermedia development system based on A/UX.andP;  In a nutshell, Intermedia letsusers create and follow interconnected pieces of information across anetwork.andP;  The system uses a hypermedia design for incorporating all thesepieces of information-text, graphics, scanned images, and timelines (forchronological events).andP;  Since hypermedia was fundamental to the system, andgiven Apple's parental role in the development of hypermedia, Brown's choiceof A/UX was logical.andP;  But die users of die system were also a consideration.andO;Intermedia is used by both faculty and students to teach and learn in a broadrange of disciplines-not just computer science.andP;  For detailed informationabout Intermedia, see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  10.)andM;Apple also won a major Air Force contract last August, only to have itdisputed seven months later.andP;  Apple is still shipping on the contract Withthe release of 2.0, the protest may be a wash anyway, since it was based onthe fact that the workstations in question included A/UX 1.1, which didn'tallow you to reach Macintosh functionality without first leaving the Unixenvironment.andP;  Version 2.0 doesn't have this limitation and can replace A/UX1.1 on the contracted workstations.andP;  Now A/UX has Macintosh functionality,which is what Air Force users were after in the first place.andM;Whether or not A/UX seeps into mainstream Unix, A/UX may always have a homein distributed architectures.andP;  Given their ease of use, A/UX workstations,integrated into a chent/server distributed network architecture, may become apotent force in the market.andP;  Not that other Unix workstations couldn't play asimilar role.andP;  But A/UX has the added value of Macintosh applications and theMacintosh interface.andP;  Considering the many Mac applications that run on A/UX,the system already has more off-the-shelf applications than other Unixplatforms (see Illustration 2).andM;Pricing and Availability.andP;  A/UX started shipping in June.andP;  The software costsfrom $795 to $995.andP;  Considering the additional software A/UX provides (see&quot;Tools&quot; below), this is an aggressive price.andP;  You can purchase the systemeither preinstalled on a Mac II computer or 80MB Mac hard disk or on floppydisks, a CD-ROM disc, or tape.andP;  Update tapes, CD-ROM discs, and floppy disksare also available, as well as right-to-copy licenses.andM;For some customers, some of Apple's optional A/UX products may be necessities(see &quot;System Requirements&quot; below), which, of course, adds to the cost of thesystem.andP;  MacX for A/UX costs $350; the Apple EtherTalk card, $699; and pagedmemory management unit-PMMU-4needed for the basic Mac II), $499.andM;ArchitectureandM;A/UX is more than just an operating system.andP;  Apple has the same architecturaltheory for A/UX that it has always had for the Mac: No application shouldexist in a vacuum; desktop functionality should be tied intrinsically to thecore of the system.andP;  Thus, A/UX, following this theory, consists of fivelayers: application, user interface, Toolbox, system software, and hardware.andO;(See Illustration 3.)andM;Yet, Apple offers some flexibility within these layers.andP;  The operating systemcan be either Mac OS or A/UX, and the Mac Toolbox can be swapped for the XWindow System and an X toolkit.andP;  (No, you can't build an X application withthe Aft Toolbox.) Or you can bypass the graphical user interface issuealtogether and run a generic System V application from an A/UX window.andM;The advantage of using Toolbox-conformant applications lies in theirintegration with the Macintosh system.andP;  You can cut and paste from both Macenvironments.andP;  X applications, on the other hand, merely borrow the Macwindow manager for window manipulation and appearance.andP;  The disadvantage ofusing Toolbox-conformant applications is that their binaries won't run on anyother Unix systems.andM;SYSTEM SOFTWARE.andP;  A/UX is based on System V.2.andP;  We were surprised that Applehasn't at least upgraded to V.3.andP;  Apple explained that V.2 better suits itsMotorola architecture, and that it has implemented streams-is-the mostcritical component of V.3.andP;  Besides, the company is looking into alternativekernels for A/UX.andP;  (Apple wouldn't name names, but the Mach kernel springs tomind, mainly because of its affiliations with Steve Jobs and NEXT.) A/UX alsofeatures NFS 3.2, support for shared libraries, and a complete set of BSDextensions, including the file system and TCP/IP.andM;TOOLS.andP;  A big improvement of A/UX 2.0 is its support for Finder, theMacintosh graphical desktop shell (ak.a.andP;  desktop manager).andP;  A/UX also offersits own mouse-driven editor (which is more user oriented than, say,Berkeley's vi), a dialog-driven Unix command builder, AppleTalk, and tools(e.g., C compiler, debuggers, source code control system) to assistprogrammers in developing new applications or porting existing software toA/UX.andP;  A set of Unix libraries allows C programs to access the functionalityof the Macintosh Toolbox, including QuickDraw, which Mac systems use toperform all graphic operations.andM;For systems administration, A/UX automatically configures to a simple kernelthat includes only the necessary devices, rather than a full kernel thatoften includes more configuration than a system needs.andP;  It also featuresautomatic recovery and standard Unix scripts for administrative functions.andM;DOS INTEGRATION.andP;  A third-party vendor has filled the DOS/Mac gap.andP;  SoftPC byInsignia Solutions (Sunnyvale, California) integrates DOS in the Macenvironment.andP;  With it, you can open any number of windows, launch a DOSapplication, and cut and paste text between Mac, MacX, and DOS applications.andO;SoftPC is similar to other Unix/DOS integrators from companies such as Locusand Phoenix Technologies, though it's perhaps lesser known.andP;  It runs as a DOSterminal emulator and provides access from and file integration with dienative A/UX environment.andM;NETWORKING.andP;  Connections to the TCP/EP and X.25 worlds have been availablefrom Apple for quite some time.andP;  Furthermore, the Mac Communications Toolbox,an optional add-on, eliminates the need for an application to designate aparticular communications protocol.andP;  Instead, die application invokes one ofthe Communications Toolbox managers which provide interfaces for specificservices (e.g., terminal emulation, file transfer, and resource management).andO;Also, Apple has recently upscaled its AppleTalk services, which A/UX offersfor print and file-sharing (client-only-an AppleTalk server will be availableby the year's end).andP;  Systems can be integrated into NFS schemes, as well.andO;The user has transparent, point-and click access to both the local data onthe Mac and all die data on the network.andP;  Given its basic strength  userinterface and existing Mac applications) and Apple's orientation of providinga window into die corporation for individual users, playing the role of theclient in the client-server model is the obvious course for Mac.andM;To that end, Apple has recently developed board-level and softwareconnectivity solutions for client Macs into the IBM 3270, SLDC, Token-Ring,and APPC environments.andP;  It also has a very close relationship with Digital.andO;The two companies are codeveloping a variety of products and tools to enableMac applications to share information, computing power, and network resourceswith VMS systems.andM;A Limited Role.andP;  The other model of distributed computing peer-to-peernetworking-holds that the networking architecture should be flexible enoughto let workstations run as clients or servers.andP;  If you stick strictly withgeneric Unix, fine; die Mac is as accommodating a peer as the next Unix box.andO;But if you want to leverage the benefits of the Mac in a peer network, forgetit.andP;  Mac data cannot be accessed by other users on die network.andP;  The Mac caninitiate a process on another Unix server, but a Unix workstation can'tinitiate a Mac process.andM;Apple's vision, on the other hand, is to empower the individual and make theorganization more effective by making the individual more productive.andO;Therefore, Apple's implementation thrust is for the Mac predominantly as theclient, from which the user can access data anywhere across the network.andO;While we certainly agree that most Macs will act as clients, the architectureshould be flexible enough to support the best configuration for theorganization.andP;  For a complete analysis of Apple's overall networkingstrategy, see Network Monitor, Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  6.)andM;SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.andP;  A/UX doesn't demand any more system resources than domost Unix systems.andP;  It runs on all Macintosh II computers and the SE/30.andP;  Thesystem requires at least 4MB of memory (for MacX, add another 1MB), an 80MBhard disk, an Ethernet card for Ethernet communications, and a video card.andM;System Hardware.andP;  In March, Apple began shipping a new Mac II that betterexploits the power of A/UX than does the rest of the Mac II line.andP;  TheMacintosh IIfx is a fast machine-much faster than most 386-based PCs andalmost twice as fast as its nearest family member, the Mac IIci.andP;  It's a 40KM Motorola 68030/68882 combination with added cache, twin I/O processors,and a new SCSI/Direct Memory Access controller.andM;Judged by its marketing literature, Apple seems more concerned with theadvantages the Mac IIfx will bring to Mac OS than those it will bring toA/UX.andP;  Still, the computer should compete favorably with low-end Unixworkstations.andP;  The company is targeting scientific researchers as well asusers of financial, animation, and design and engineering applications.andO;Price ranges from $8,969 to $14,466.andP;  Upgrades for the Mac 11 and Mac IIxcost $2,999 (plus additional memory)-a very good price, considering the addedperformance.andM;Other than the basic II (with PNW and IIfx, Apple has four computers that runA/UX:andM;The Mac SE/30.andP;  The SE/30 is Apple's highest-performanceandM;(16 NW) compact computer with a 68030/68882 processor,andM;integrated monitor, internal expansion slot, and a 1.4MBandM;floppy disk drive.andM;The Mac IIcx.andP;  The cx is a 16 NM 68030/68882 processorandM;with three internal expansion slots for communications (EthernetandM;and Token-Ring cards) and video.andP;  The computer comesandM;with a 1.4MB floppy disk drive, a SCSI port, serial ports, andandM;sound ports.andM;The Mac IIx.andP;  The Mac IIx is another 16 MHz 68030/68882andM;machine.andP;  It offers die features of the cx, except that it has sixandM;NuBus expansion slots and can accommodate a 5.25-inchandM;hard disk drive (i.e., it has a higher storage capacity than theandM;cx or SE/30).andM;The Mac IIci.andP;  The advantage of the Mac IIci is performance.andM;It runs at 25 NM instead of 16 NW.andP;  It also has a built-inandM;video circuity and a built-in connector for an optional cacheandM;memory card, as well as the NuBus slots, SCSI port, andandM;serial ports featured in the other models.andM;ImplementationandM;DESKTOP MANAGEMENT.andP;  A/UX offers more desktop management capabilities thanmost of its conventional Unix counterparts.andP;  While either the Motif orOpenLook toolkit may be used to create graphical interfaces for X-basedapplications, neither addresses desktop management The A/UX interface, on theother hand, encompasses both the underlying window system and desktopmanagement.andM;It's probably a good idea to differentiate between the two desktopenvironments A/UX offers-the Finder environment and the CommandShellenvironment.andM;Finder, the traditional Macintosh desktop manager, provides graphical,point-and-click access to files, applications, and system utilities,andM;The Command Shell offers the traditional Unix command line interface fromwithin a Finder window.andP;  Finder.andP;  Navigating your way around A/UX Finder isbasically no different from navigating Mac OS Finder.andP;  It has five initialpull-down menus-Apple, File, Edit, View, and Special-and an iconic view ofthe file system.andP;  A/UX sports typical Mac dialog boxes and keyboardshortcuts, check marks that identify active menu item selections, and adrag-and-drop metaphor for moving files and directories.andM;Finder menus contain all the information most nontechnical users need:andM;* The Apple menu (which, for those unfamiliar with the Macintosh, is accessedby clicking on the apple in the upper left-hand comer of the screen) containsa list of available desk accessories-handy little applications shipped withevery Apple computer: alarm clock, calculator, chooser, control panel, findfile, key caps, and scrapbook.andP;  The File menu includes commands for filemanipulation (e.g., Open, Close, Print, Display Privileges, etc.).andM;* The Edit menu is used to edit or change text in windows.andP;  Options includeCut, Paste, Copy, Clear, Select All, and Show Clipboard.andM;* The View menu offers several options for viewing file and directories.andP;  Youcan view the file system by small icon, icon, name, date, size, or kind(i.e., type).andM;*  The Special menu contains a bunch of miscellaneous commands: Clean Up,Empty Trash, Erase Disk, Restart, Shut Down, and Logout.andM;As we mentioned, these menus cover most user-related tasks.andP;  However, a fewfunctions are missing from the main menus that a user might need.andP;  Forinstance, although you can view file information and privileges, you can'tchange diem from the menus.andP;  Furthermore, there is no system-level Helpfacility, which is especially crucial in an often esoteric environment likeUnix.andM;*  Customization.andP;  The Control Panel in Apple's Desk Accessories offers abroad range of dialog-driven customization options, from specifying the colorof icons, background patterns, and alert settings, right down to setting thespeed of cursor blinks.andP;  A MacTCP Control Panel toggles between networkconfigurations.andM;*  CommandShell.andP;  As its name implies, the A/UX CommandShell utility providesa menu-driven command shell environment CommandShell consists of six menus:andM;*  The File menu, which manages theandM;CommandShell window environmentandM;From the File menu, you can chooseandM;commands to create, open, close, save,andM;and print shell windows.andM;*  The Edit menu, which contains items for cutting, pasting, copying, andselecting text in a shell window as well as accessing the A/UX commandbuilder.andM;* The Windows menu, which is used to manipulate the presentation of shellwindows.andP;  Windows can be tiled (vertically and horizontally), enlarged,hidden, rotated, etc.andP;  You can also manipulate active jobs by accessing theA/UX system console from the Windows menu.andM;* The Fonts menu, which contains a fist of available fonts and point sizesthat you can use in the shell window.andP;  The Commands menu, which lets youredraw the screen and gives you a choice of either scrolling through windowsor letting die system erase any information that scrolls off the top of diewindow.andM;* The Preference menu, which lets you edit some of the properties of a shellwindow.andP;  You can configure system message notifications and set defaultwindow parameters (e.g., font and font size) for new and active windows.andM;Commando.andP;  There's been some debate over how much desktop functionality auser needs.andP;  Most users spend their time in applications and don't need torun Unix commands.andP;  Then again, others do.andP;  And users who do need to run Unixcommands are not going to find the Unix system shell an inviting environment.andO;Thus, Apple has developed a dialog-driven Unix command builder calledCommando.andM;There are three ways to invoke Commando.andP;  You can type &quot;cmdo&quot; followed by thename of the command or PM the name of the command and select Commando fromthe CommandShell Edit menu.andP;  However, from a user's perspective, it'sprobably most practical to take advantage of a folder (or directory)appropriately called &quot;Useful Commands.&quot; Useful Commands contains iconizedfrequently-used Unix commands, such as apropos, diff, find, grep, and Is.andO;The icon names also include the full name of the command, which is helpful.andO;For instance, &quot;chmod&quot; doesn't mean much to most users, but &quot;changepermission&quot; certainly does.andP;  The Useful Commands directory contains only afew of the over 500 A/UX commands, but you can add other commands to thefolder at will.andP;  All that it takes is filling out a simple A/UX dialog box.andM;When you execute the command by double-clicking on its icon, a Commandodialog box appears and leads you step-by-step through the command.andP;  It liststhe options associated with the command and bangs out the appropriate commandline code.andP;  A modest Help window is also available in the dialog box thatdescribes the command and its purpose.andP;  (See Illustration 4.)andM;TEXT EDITOR.andP;  We mentioned earlier that A/UX has its own editor forprogrammers.andP;  The A/UX TextEditor is similar to other Unix system editors,but Apple has added some Mac-like editing functionality.andP;  It even has menusand dialog boxes.andP;  Menus are available for file manipulation, searching andreplacing text creating markers, and window presentation.andP;  Dialog boxeshandle things like text formatting and saving a file under a different name.andM;While the TextEditor is probably suitable for those few end users who mightattempt to write Unix scripts, its graphical nature would annoy mostprogrammers.andP;  For instance, every time you create a new TextEditor file, uppops a dialog box to specify the name and location for the new file.andP;  Unixprogrammers can't be bothered with such mechanisms.andP;  They prefer to just bangon the keyboard.andP;  Keyboard bypass would be helpful.andM;X WINDOW SUPPORT.andP;  MacX, a Macintosh operating system implementation of XWindow (11.3) software, is an optional product that has been designed toallow the Mac to play in an X environment.andP;  Under A/UX, the Mac can becomeeither an X client or display server for an X-compliant application runningon a host.andP;  MacX for Mac OS, on the other hand, doesn't come with Xlibraries, so it can only be a server.) NUX will operate on top of AppleTalk,TCP/IP, and DECnet.andM;Under the Finder, die Mac can support a number of windows, mixed and matchedbetween Mac and X. The user can cut and paste text between local Mac and Xapplications via the Mac Clipboard.andP;  As with other X implementations, youcannot yet cut and paste graphics between Mac and X applications.andP;  X hasn'tyet standardized on a common way to represent graphics of multipleapplications.andM;A Choice of Window Managers.andP;  Keeping to its Mac model and avoiding the userinterface debates associated with X (or perhaps adding to them), Apple hasdesigned MacX windows to look and feel as much like a Mac window as possible.andO;In other words, it uses its own window manager to manipulate windows (e.g.,andO;move, size, minimize, close) and to provide window borders (see illustration5).andM;However, A/UX doesn't mandate that you use the Mac window manager.andP;  To attainwindow management flexibility, Apple makes a distinction between rooted androotless modes of MacX.andP;  (Well, technically, it's X that makes thedistinction.) In the rootless mode, the root X window is made invisible, sowhat you see in the background is the Macintosh desktop.andP;  In other words, theMacintosh window manager is in operation.andP;  In the rooted mode of operation, Xwindows appear inside a Macintosh window.andP;  These windows are plain X;conceivably, any X window manager can control them.andP;  The two modes areaccessible concurrently.andM;Recently, a third-party developer called Integrated Computer SystemsCarnbridge, Massachusetts) has ported Motif to A/UX.andP;  Although Apple doesn'tprovide Motif support itself, it is certainly enthusiastic about the factthat A/UX can indeed support Motif applications.andP;  We must admit, though,we're disappointed that Apple wasn't enthusiastic enough about Motif to dothe port itself X comes with a standard window manager called TWM.andP;  Motif isthe only commercial window manager currently available for the A/UXenvironment (other than the Macintosh window manager, that is).andP;  However,it's not unreasonable to assume that a third party might come along and portOpenLook to A/UX, as well.andM;Font Technology.andP;  MacX comes with the standard X library of fonts-includingCharter, Times, Helvetica, Courier, New Century Schoolbook, and Symbol-and afont manager to manipulate them.andP;  MacX can also access the Macintosh screenfonts located in the system file.andM;What's Left? Apple has actually enhanced its X Window support quite a bit,especially in its integration with the Finder and its flexibility in terms ofwindow management.andP;  However, Apple's X environment isn't on a par with theA/UX environment.andP;  Although it looks Mac-ish and uses the Mac window managerfor window manipulation, MacX doesn't have die performance or desktopmanagement that A/UX offers.andP;  Unlike other Unix platforms that havestandardized on X, A/UX merely offers X. MacX is a secondary solution.andO;Therefore, it hasn't been fully integrated with die Finder, and it doesn'thave access to QuickDraw graphics or to its graphics board accelerator.andP;  MacXis not even part of the bundled A/UX product.andP;  You have to purchase itseparately, as you must Motif.andM;Maybe its greatest disadvantage, though, is a symptom of a broaderproblem-Apple's limited role as a network peer.andP;  The Mac only makes sense asa server in an X environment.andP;  Although you can access any number of Xapplications, Mac applications cannot be X clients.andP;  In other words, other Xworkstations and terminals cannot reach Mac applications.andP;  Granted, Apple isnot alone with this problem; most applications cannot work in an Xenvironment.andP;  The difference is, however, that other vendors are making aneffort to X-ize their applications.andP;  For instance, Sun's XView, anOpenLook-based X toolkit, was developed to leverage existing SunViewapplications for an X environment.andM;FuturesandM;A/UX has come a long way since its much-maligned first release, but Appleisn't planning to rest on its laurels now that it has come out with a decentproduct.andP;  Without revealing details of future enhancements, the company hasprovided die directions A/UX will take in the next few releases.andP;  First andforemost, Apple wants to adhere to standards.andP;  The company has promised totake a more proactive approach by participating in standards organizations.andO;Until now, Apple always seemed to play a wait-and-see game with standards,and we're glad that it plans to be more aggressive.andM;Otherwise, Apple is intent on keeping A/UX on an even keel with Mac OS-interms of both system functionality and communications.andP;  Apple claims it needs12 months to incorporate System 7.0 into A/UX-12 months after 7.0 isreleased, that is.andP;  That's really not a bad turnaround when you consider thework that needs to be done.andP;  (See &quot;In Light of Mac OS&quot; below.) Apple alsoplans further Mac-inization of A/UX, especially in system and networkadministration.andP;  The company would also like to expand the networking side ofA/UX (good!) as well as broaden the spectrum of high- and low-end hardware.andO;This, undoubtedly, means a broader spectrum of workstations, sinceMacintoshes don't make appropriate servers, unless you have an all-Macnetwork in place.andM;IN LIGHT OF MAC OS.andP;  Mac OS is and ever shall be Apple's premier operatingsystem.andP;  Since Apple maintains that Mac OS will continue to shape the futureof A/UX, some characteristics of System 7.0 are worth noting:andM;* 32-bit addressing.andP;  Granted, 32-bit addressing is no big dealandM;to Unix users because Unix has had it for some time.andP;  However,andM;eventually, it may ensure greater application interoperabilityandM;between Mac and A/UX applications.andP;  Currently,andM;only 32-bit Mac applications will be able to run on eitherandM;operating system.andP;  In die meantime, AAJX includes an optionalandM;24-bit environment that runs Mac applications, butandM;they can't take advantage of virtual memory.andM;* Database Access Manager.andP;  The database access managerandM;provides remote database access through CL/1 communicationsandM;protocol.andP;  CL/1 lets Mac users reach SQL-based databasesandM;on Digital and IBM hosts.andP;  Such a connection would beandM;ideal for Unix hosts as well, but CL/I doesn't support UnixandM;machines.andP;  Thus, it doesn't seem appropriate for A/UX.andP;  TheandM;protocol either needs to be enhanced or replaced.andM;*  InterApplication Communication (IAC).andP;  Apple's architectureandM;for exchanging commands and data between local andandM;distributed Macintosh applications is a significant developmentandM;IAC will allow users to create live links to differentandM;applications and automate tasks over AppleTalk networks asandM;long as the applications have been modified to support dieandM;architecture.andP;  Ideally, this will become a cross-operating systemandM;facility (i.e., across Mac OS and A/UX).andP;  Fully integratingandM;IAC services into A/UX may be tricky.andP;  However, givenandM;that the Mac Toolbox supports both Apple operating systems,andM;Apple's IAC might lend itself easily to transparentandM;links between Mac and A/UX applications.andM;* Finder 7.0.andP;  Apple is expanding Finder to include additional functionalityfor desktop management (e.g.andP;  grouping desktop items, acessing the desktopdirectly from applications configuration (e.g., icon editing, setting systempreferences), and system administration (e.g., accessing the Help manager,Help development tools, and system management functions).andP;  Also, file sharingwill be integrated into Finder, so workstations can share files withoutrelying on a dedicated server.andM;ConclusionandM;We're satisfied that A/UX is now a complete operating system in its own rightIt doesn't seem to be just a quick-and-dirty solution to let Apple play in aUnix environment, which we feared when the product was first released.andP;  Notonly has Apple smoothly integrated A/UX into the Finder, it also has asurprisingly convincing story to tell about standards, with support for XWindow, TCP/IP, NFS, Posix, FEPS, and BSD extensions.andM;If only its interface were so open.andP;  How ironic that the most notableadvantage of A/UX is also its most notable disadvantage.andP;  We have fewcomplaints about A/UX other than Apple's decision to keep the interfaceproprietary.andP;  The notion of licensing that interface is intriguing.andP;  It couldoffer Apple huge potential as die de facto graphical user interface.andP;  Applecould easily capitalize on the current confusion that the OpenLook/Motif waris causing in the Unix marketplace.andP;  As it stands now, A/UX can support otherUnix and X-based applications, but other Unix and X-based platforms can'tsupport A/UX applications.andM;Frankly, we don't foresee Apple changing its stance any time soon.andP;  Thecompany doesn't consider opening up its Toolbox a practical businessdecision.andP;  Instead, it is trying to point out the advantages of sticking withthe Mac as a front-end machine.andP;  And the Mac does have its advantages.andP;  It'scertainly faster than third-party X-based desktop managers we've seen, and,with the aid of the Mac Toolbox, applications are tightly integrated with theNandamp; environment.andM;COMPETITION.andP;  A/UX would fare better had it been introduced two years agowith all its pieces in place.andP;  In the meantime, its strategic advantage isshrinking.andP;  Not only has Windows 3.0 put Apple on the defensive, but otherUnix vendors are reaching the desktop.andP;  For instance, Sun has recentlyannounced OpenWindows, which includes a DeskSet that has desktop managementfacilities similar to that of A/UX and that runs only on Sun workstations.andO;Likewise, Hewlett-Packard's VUE (Visual User Environment) fits the bill forBP Unix workstations.andP;  Many hardware vendors are licensing sophisticatedX-based desktop managers from third parties such as X.desktop from IXI(Cambridge, England) and Looking Glass from Visix Software (Reston,Virginia).andP;  Both these products already offer the interapplicationcommunication functionality that Apple intends to unleash with IAC.andP;  So doesHP's NewWave, which has recently been ported to Unix, with an X version onits way.andP;  (Apple claims that IAC will be a more user-oriented system thanNewWave.andP;  We haven't seen the product yet, but, if this is the case, we lookforward to its release.) SCO's OpenDesktop has also debuted as a possible defacto Unix desktop development platform.andP;  For a complete analysis of NewWaveOffice under Unix, see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  4; of OpenDesktop, see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  6.)andM;It's not that these systems actually provide a better interface than theMac-either in terms of look and feel or of performance.andP;  But most do have theadvantage of X compliancy.andP;  Although Apple is quick to point out thedoggedness of X-based desktop managers and interfaces, they are at leastnetwork-wise and hardware independent.andM;The Mac Heritage.andP;  A/UX may have an edge because of its Mac heritage.andP;  Sinceit supports the Mac Toolbox, it already supports a number of shrink-wrappedapplications.andP;  Users can leverage their library of Mac applications and stillgain the multitasking networking and communications capabilities of Unix.andO;Powerful stuff.andP;  As a client in distributed environments, A/UX is ideal.andM;The success of A/UX weighs heavily on ISVS.andP;  There may always be a place forA/UX in distributed environments that already contain MacIntoshes, but we'renot talking about that.andP;  We're talking about Apple's ability to lure new UnixISVs to write to A/UX.andP;  We suspect that Apple's reputation in the graphicaluser interface department will lend A/UX some distinction.andP;  Apple already hasbuilt a reputation on its graphical interface; it's already ironed out thewrinkles in implementing graphical interfaces; and users are alreadycomfortable with iL Apple has come out with a versatile, well-designed, andwellimplemented Unix system.andP;  We'd hate to see it reduced to a mere stopgaprole between the worlds of Unix and Macintosh.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
