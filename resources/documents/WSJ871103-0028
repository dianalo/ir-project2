The three-part Treasury financing operation begins today with the sale of $9.75 billion of three-year notes. Rates often climb prior to the government's quarterly refunding. Meanwhile, investor fear of a possible recession appears to be subsiding, many analysts say.    &quot;The terror has gone out of the Treasury bill market and we're back to reality in terms of rate levels,&quot; said F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Since the Oct. 19 crash in the stock market, both short-term and long-term rates declined as much as 1.5 percentage points as the Federal Reserve eased credit and worried equity investors sought refuge in Treasury securities.    But yesterday, as the stock market rallied again, the so-called flight to quality in the credit markets abated. For instance, the average rate on the Treasury's new 13-week bills sold yesterday, rose to 5.80% from 5.12% at last week's auction. In the bond market, prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds fell nearly a point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate and municipal bonds also tumbled.    In addition, traders said corporations and other big investors appeared more willing to lend bonds and notes to securities firms that had sold borrowed securities. That, they said, was another sign calm was returning to the financial markets.    &quot;The bond market is getting pulled in two directions,&quot; said Paul F. Jacobson, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;There are still fears of a recession. But right now the (bond) market is under pressure from a lower dollar and the large supply&quot; of government debt to be auctioned this week.    In addition to today's three-year government note sale and tomorrow's $9.25 billion of 10-year notes, the Treasury also will sell $4.75 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday. Yesterday, it said it will sell more of the current 8 7/8% bonds due 2017.    The auctions come as the Fed's credit policy committee meets in Washington today to review its recent strategy. Some analysts say the Federal Open Market Committee will ratify its easier credit stance since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse and that it may authorize further easing if the economy falters in the weeks or months ahead.    &quot;The Fed will approve its (recent) accommodative policy with an eye toward more accommodation if the economic data is warranted,&quot; said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura International Securities Inc. &quot;The monetary policies of the Bank of Japan and the Fed appear to be mutually consistent,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;the Bank of Japan is reversing its recent strategy by easing credit.&quot;    Mr. Resler, who visited Tokyo last week, said Japanese investors, who have purchased a growing share of U.S. debt in recent years, aren't likely to show much interest in this week's Treasury auctions. Nevertheless, he said Japanese securities firms likely will remain active participants in the auctions &quot;because the Ministry of Finance is encouraging&quot; them to do so.    Mr. Resler said he isn't convinced the West German Bundesbank is prepared to follow an easier credit policy despite the turbulence in financial markets around the world the past two weeks. Nevertheless, last night Bundesbank Chairman Karl Otto Poehl said he opposes higher interest rates either in West Germany or in the U.S. He also said the so-called Louvre accord earlier this year to stabilize exchange rates still is being followed by major industrial countries.    Mr. Poehl spoke here last night at a meeting of the American Council on Germany. Despite U.S. criticism of West German monetary policy last month, monetary policy in West Germany &quot;is anything but restrictive&quot; said Mr. Poehl.    &quot;We are not neurotic on inflation, but overshooting (the central bank's monetary targets) for a lengthy period of time increases the risk of adversely affecting credibility, and it is no exaggeration to say that credibility is the capital stock of any central bank,&quot; Mr. Poehl said in remarks prepared for delivery.    But after stock markets in Asia and Europe collapsed in the wake of the Oct. 19 plunge here, fear of inflation and rapid money supply growth almost disappeared as the bond market staged a record rally in the last two weeks of the month. For example, an investor who bought the Treasury's current 30-year bond on &quot;Black Monday&quot; and sold it last Friday, had a profit of $129.40 for each $1,000 face amount.    That 12.94% total annualized return is probably the biggest ever for a two-week period, according to data compiled by the Ryan Financial Strategy Group, a fixed-income strategy firm.    Despite the rise in most interest rates yesterday, Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C., lowered its prime lending rate to 8.75% from 9%, effective immediately. However, the nation's largest banks left their prime, or base, rates unchanged at 9%.    Among the major developments yesterday:    --The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 fell to 97 14/32 from 98 10/32 Friday. The yield rose to 9.12% from 9.04%.    --The government's 8 5/8% notes due in 1997 fell to 97 21/32 from 98 3/8 Friday, as the yield rose to 8.99% from 8.87%.    --Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 7.90 points to 1232.73. It ranged between 1227.66 and 1240.15.    --The federal funds rate averaged 6.71%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The rate on funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.62% Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said.    --Short-term Treasury bill rates rose sharply at the government's regular weekly auction yesterday. The average rate on new 13-week bills sold yesterday jumped to 5.80% from 5.12% at last week's auction. The average on new 26-week bills climbed to 6.24% from 5.98%.    --In the corporate sector, a $150 million issue of Texas Gas Transmission Corp. seven-year debentures was offered to investors through underwriters led by Goldman Sachs. Texas Gas is a pipeline company. The 10% debentures were priced at 99.75 to yield 10.05%, or 1.25 percentage points above the yield on comparable Treasury notes. The issue is rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --In the municipal bond arena, the volume of new issues continued to be light. A proposed $126.2 million bond issue by the DuPage County, Ill., Forest Preserve District was tentatively priced by a group of underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. Yields ranged from 6.40% on bonds due in 1992 to 8.20% on bonds due in 2007. The general obligation bonds are rated double-A by Moody's and double-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                              13-Week            26-Week Applications ......... $20,347,220,000     $22,217,075,000 Accepted bids ......... $6,400,220,000      $6,402,775,000 Accepted at low price ............ 23%                 70% Accepted noncompet'ly . $1,143,920,000        $833,210,000 Average price (Rate) ... 98.534(5.80%)       96.845(6.24%) High price (Rate) ...... 98.554(5.72%)       96.866(6.20%) Low price (Rate) ....... 98.521(5.85%)       96.840(6.25%) Coupon equivalent .............. 5.98%               6.55%   Both issues are dated Nov. 5.
