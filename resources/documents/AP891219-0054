(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A spectacular fire fed by oil-soakedwood floors burned a converted 126-year-old mill complex today inthe biggest blaze in Providence history, officials said. Threefirefighters suffered minor injuries.   Up to 150 firefighters _ every one in the city and some fromRhode Island and Massachusetts _ battled the blaze in 17-degreeweather. The fire gutted six of nine buildings in the complex,which had been converted to shops and other businesses.   Fire Chief Michael F. Moise said it was ``the most extensivearea of fire that we've ever seen in the city of Providence.''   The fire was declared under control about 1:30 a.m., eight hoursafter it began, but Moise said it could take three days to dousethe hot spots at the complex of two- and four-story brick buildingsspread over a quarter-mile.   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.   ``The floors were pretty well-oiled,'' said Fire Departmentspokesman Larry Donahue. ``They had machines that sat on thosefloors for years, and they were oiled every day over a period of100 years or so. That makes them more flammable.''</TEXT></DOC>
