Judge Thomas Jackson of Washington ruled that althoughcivil servants remained free under the law to write or speakwithout compensation, the financial burden of barring outsidepay amounted to an unconstitutional restraint of expression.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Jackson specifically limited his decision toexecutive-branch civil servants, leaving in place a ban onhonorariums for members of Congress and legislative staffmembers.   The restriction on lawmakers wasn't challenged in thiscase. The judge suggested that it was supported by a morecompelling purpose: preventing the appearance and actualityof politicians' being bought off by private interests.   The judge ordered that the law stay in place temporarilywhile the Bush administration decides whether to appeal. AJustice Department spokesman said the agency was &quot;stillreviewing the opinion&quot; and declined to comment on thelikelihood of an appeal.   There have been efforts in Congress to pass legislationthat would exempt executive-branch workers from thehonorarium ban, but those efforts stalled last year in theSenate, and the bill's future is uncertain.   The ban on outside speaking and writing fees for civilservants was part of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, whichimposed a similar prohibition on almost anyone in federalservice. The provision covering executive-branch workers waschallenged in court by numerous career civil servants actingindividually and by two national unions representing federalworkers. The challengers argued that the bar infringed ontheir free-speech rights and didn't serve a sufficientlyimportant government purpose to survive judicial scrutiny.   Judge Jackson vindicated the challengers, concluding thatthe restriction was unconstitutionally &quot;over-inclusive,&quot; inthat it limited expression that couldn't possibly suggesteven the appearance of impropriety. To illustrate this point,he noted in his 23-page opinion that the plaintiffs include aNuclear Regulatory Commission lawyer who writes on Russianhistory and a Food and Drug Administration microbiologist whoreviews dance performances for print and broadcast media.   Moreover, the judge said, the ban violated constitutionalprinciples of equality by banning some forms of expression --speeches, articles and appearances for profit -- but notothers, including works of fiction or films. In this sense,the prohibition was also &quot;under-inclusive,&quot; he asserted.   As a practical matter, the financial restriction hassilenced many civil servants who write or give speeches ontheir own time, said Greg O'Duden, director of litigation forthe National Treasury Employees Union, which had filed suitin the case. Before the ban, he said, union members hadrelied on the outside compensation &quot;to help sustain theirwriting -- to buy home computers, for example.&quot;   In his ruling, Judge Jackson invoked the Supreme Court'sdecision in December, invalidating a New York law thatconfiscated criminals' book and movie profits and made themoney available to a fund for victims.   He observed that the purpose of the so-called &quot;Son of Sam&quot;statute, named for the alias of serial killer DavidBerkowitz, was &quot;to compensate for harm done, not to suppressthe thought expressed.&quot; Similarly, the judge said, thehonorarium law was aimed at preventing actual or perceivedcorruption, not blocking speech itself. Nevertheless, henoted, &quot;the Supreme Court . . . found the financial burdenalone a sufficient inhibition of protected speech to offendthe Constitution although the speaker remained at liberty tospeak for free.&quot; (National Treasury Employees Union vs. U.S.,U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Nos.90-2922, -3027, 3044)   ---   FEDERAL AGENCIES MUST disclose worker addresses to unions,court rules.   Enforcing a federal statute designed to help unionscontact their members, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals ruled that giving workers' home addresses to unionsdoesn't violate their privacy.   The case arose when several U.S. agencies and departments,including the Department of Interior and the Navy, refused todisclose workers' addresses to union representatives whowanted to contact members at their homes. The Federal LaborRelations Authority, which reviews disputes between federalemployers and unions, charged that the nondisclosure was anunfair labor practice.   In the past, the issue seemed settled by the FederalService Labor-Management Relations Statute, which requireddisclosure. Various appellate courts had also held that theFreedom of Information Act created an exception to federalprivacy laws, which generally prohibit disclosing personalinformation about government workers.   But new legal questions arose in 1989, when the U.S.Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving news organizationsthat wanted information about crime suspects, that the FOIA'sreach was limited when the parties requesting informationweren't asking about &quot;what the government was up to.&quot; Somelower courts interpreted the 1989 case as barring disclosureof workers' home addresses.   In its recent decision, however, the Ninth Circuit ruledthat the privacy-based exception to FOIA didn't apply,because the information requested didn't constitute a&quot;clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.&quot;   The appellate court balanced the public's interest indisclosure against the degree of invasion of personal privacyand found that the &quot;interest in keeping one's home addressfrom the union bargaining on one's behalf is minimal.&quot;   The court concluded: &quot;(T)he unions' interest in carryingout their statutory duties, the public's interest infostering collective bargaining for federal employees, andthe difficulty in obtaining the information in other waysoutweigh the privacy interest of those employees who wish tokeep their home addresses secret from the unions.&quot;   A spokesman for the FLRA said the authority was &quot;pleased&quot;with the court's decision. A spokesman for the Department ofJustice, which represented the federal agencies, wasn'tavailable to comment on the case.
