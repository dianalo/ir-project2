Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after talkslast week in Washington that Reagan's tougher line was the finalobstacle to Kremlin acceptance of a U.N.-brokered deal to get theRed Army out of Afghanistan. But he said the Soviets might pull outeven without a U.N. agreement.   Last December, Reagan said publicly that military assistance tothe Afghan mujahedeen would continue until the Soviets werecompletely out of Afghanistan. But the Washington Post reportedSaturday that the administration already is ending the supply ofStinger anti-aircraft missiles to the resistance in anticipation ofa peace settlement.   At the same time, the Post reported, the administration isrushing at least $300 million worth of other U.S.-purchasedmilitary supplies, including 120mm Spanish heavy mortars, toAfghanistan in an effort to get the weaponry there before any pactbarring future aid takes effect.   The newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, said theStinger cutoff reflects a general nervousness by the administrationabout leaving a large number of the missiles in the hands of Afghanfactions that cannot be controlled after U.S. ties are cut. Iranalready has obtained some of the missiles, perhaps through force,from one guerrilla commander.   The apparent confusion over U.S. policy results from what formerand current White House, Pentagon, State Department andcongressional officials say has been a poorly coordinated ``endgame'' strategy for Afghanistan.   ``My phone rang one day, and it was someone asking what ourpolicy was on cutting off aid to the mujahedeen,'' said a formerWhite House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I saidthat our policy was to continue the aid until the Soviets werecompletely out. Then, I called over to the State Department, andfound out they had other ideas.''   Later that same day, Dec. 3, Reagan forced the State Departmentto scramble when a reporter asked if aid to the guerrillas wouldcease when the Soviets began to withdraw. Reagan said:   ``I don't think we could do anything of the kind, because thepuppet government that has been left there has a military ... Youcan't suddenly disarm them and leave them prey to the othergovernment.''   The State Department then formulated a new policy, still not ashard as the president's, telling Congress that U.S. aid would endonce the Soviet withdrawal began, but would be resumed if Moscowcontinued to supply its client regime in Afghanistan with wepons.   ``We will continue our assistance to the Afghan resistance untilit is no longer needed,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of StateRobert Peck told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asianand Pacific Affairs on Feb. 25.   And Peck denied assertions by two congressional backers of theAfghan resistance, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Rep. CharlesWilson, D-Tex., that the department cut a secret deal with theKremlin to stop aid to the guerrillas.   ``There have been no secret deals. No deals at all,'' said Peck.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., still found theState Department position too soft, and pushed through Congress aresolution calling for aid to continue until the last Sovietsoldier leaves Afghanistan.   Still unhappy with the State Department position, Byrd warnedReagan in a letter last Tuesday that ending U.S. and Soviet aid atthe same time would have a ``shocking result'' and ``telegraph theend of our commitment to the mujahedeen while the Soviets maintainthe major portion of leverage in Afghanistan.''   He urged Reagan to ``make a thorough review of any commitmentswhich may have been made without your full support or knowledge.''   Talk of a secret deal apparently stemmed from a letter fromDeputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cueller in December 1985describing U.S. ``willingness to play an appropriate guarantor'srole in the context of a comprehensive and balanced settlement...'' Whitehead's letter was little noticed at the time, althoughhe discussed it in a speech on Dec. 13, 1985.   One of the provisions of the still-secret U.N. plan would``require Pakistan to cease permitting the use of its territory asa conduit for military assistance to the mujahedeen'' within 60days after the pact was signed, according to a Senate ForeignRelations Committee report issued last week.   The Whitehead letter and the demand that Pakistan shut down thesupply pipeline apparently led the Kremlin to believe that Reaganwas ready to end aid to the guerrillas when the Red Army began topull out.   ``Back in 1985, no one really believed that the Soviets wouldpull out, so I guess no one really thought the policy through,''said a State Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity.``When we got closer to an agreement, to the end game, we began torethink the position.''</TEXT></DOC>
