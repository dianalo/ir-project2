As the House returns to its comprehensive anti-drug bill today,lawmakers face two opposing amendments that could affect anyconvicted drug offender's right to drive.   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., proposes withholding part of astate's federal highway money unless the state requires suspensionor revocation of drivers' licenses of anyone convicted of adrug-related crime.   A substitute amendment by Rep. Glen M. Anderson, D-Calif.,provides an incentive approach. Instead of penalties, states wouldreceive Transportation Department grants for imposing the licensepenalties. The grants would pay part of the license enforcementprogram.   The overall anti-drug bill would add some $2 billion to thenation's $3.9 billion effort against illegal drugs. While the Houseexpects to approve the legislation Thursday or Friday, the Senatestill must consider its own drug bill.   A conference will almost certainly be needed to iron outdifferences, but lawmakers appear eager to pass a popularget-tough-on-drugs bill so close to the election.   The House bill, as originally written, authorizes money andinnovative programs for drug law enforcement, rehabilitation,treatment and education. Each time the House has amended themeasure during the past two weeks, it's civil, administrative, orcriminal penalties have toughened.   Under McCollum's driver's license plan, states would have toimpose suspensions of at least six months for a first convictionand at least one year for repeat convictions within a five-yearperiod.   Five percent of a state's highway money would be withheld thefirst year if there was no compliance, and 10 percent would be heldback for every subsequent year of non-compliance.   The penalty for states would begin Oct. 1, 1991. Individualspenalized would have to have been convicted after the drug measurebecame law.   The Anderson alternative would require the same six-month andone-year penalties as required under the McCollum plan.   The incentive program would offer states additional moneytotaling $25 million in the 1989 fiscal year, $50 million in 1990and $50 million in 1991.   Anderson's proposal also would apply to those convicted afterthe drug bill became law.   Over the past two weeks, the House has inserted a number ofamendments to the drug bill that reflect an attitude of ``zerotolerance'' toward any drug use, and a feeling that harsh penaltiesare needed for those who deal in drugs or merely possess them.   Liberal lawmakers have complained that the House has ignored theConstitutional safeguards that protect civil liberties such as dueprocess of law.   Amendments already approved would:   _Permit the federal death penalty for anyone who intentionallykills a person during the course of committing a drug felony.   _Deny many federal benefits, including assistance to Veteransand student loans, to anyone convicted of two or more drug-relatedoffenses.   _Allow introduction of evidence in federal criminal cases thatwas obtained through a search that violated constitutionalprotections, but undertaken in good faith.   _Create civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation forpossession of small ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaineand other drugs.   The House also approved a requirement for a system that wouldallow gun dealers to identify convicted felons attempting to buyhandguns. This amendment replaced language for a seven-day waitingperiod for handgun purchases.</TEXT></DOC>
