The fear arose when some Prodigy members discovered ananomaly in their personal computers that seemed to indicateProdigy software had captured snippets of their personalfiles. Theoretically, Prodigy could have used its electronicconnections with the machines to peer at those snippets.</LP><TEXT>   It turned out that the anomaly occurred because of a flukein the operating system that IBM-compatible computers use,not because of anything Prodigy did. Prodigy, a joint ventureof International Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co., vehemently denied that it had ever looked into people'spersonal files or would consider doing so.   To reinforce its position, Prodigy said it's makingavailable to all its members a free software disk that willensure that no extraneous data, such as personal files, canwind up in the part of the PC that the Prodigy servicereserves for itself. The software would delete any files thatare already there.   Prodigy also had Coopers andamp; Lybrand audit its privacysafeguards.
