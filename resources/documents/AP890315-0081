The Bush administration order issued Tuesday suspends theimportation of more than 110,000 assault-type weapons for whichimport applications are pending, said national drug control directorWilliam J. Bennett.   Affected by the decision are imports of AK-47s, Uzi carbines,FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug semiautomaticweapons.   On Jan. 17, a disturbed drifter, Patrick Purdy, used an AK-47 tokill five children and wound 30 other people at a Stockton, Calif.,elementary school.   Using the weapon, which allows the shooter to fire single shotsas quickly as he can pull the trigger, Purdy was able to fire 106bullets in two minutes. He then shot and killed himself with ahandgun.   A rising death toll from the use of semiautomatic weapons in gangwarfare had already prompted an outcry against the guns. But theStockton tragedy crystallized opposition and led to a nationwidemovement to ban assault weapons.   The weapons have already been banned by ordinances in Los Angelesand Cleveland.   ``This is great news. Today's action is long overdue and I urgethe administration to make it permanent,'' California AttorneyGeneral John Van De Kamp said of the federal import ban. ``Istrongly encourage the president and the Congress to followCalifornia's lead and enact legislation to permanently ban assaultweapons.''   Van De Kamp said he thought the Stockton shootings and theLegislature's move to restrict assault weapons in California ``havehad a tremendous impact on the administration's thinking on thisissue.''   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates called the import ban ``astep in the right direction.''   The Bush administration's action Tuesday also brought praise fromRobert Strang, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administrationin New York.   ``Certainly, anything that's done is helpful to us,'' Strangsaid. ``In the last year, agents across the country have been issuedsubmachine guns because of the automatic weapons that we're upagainst on a daily basis. ... Certainly, anything we can do tolessen the firepower of the drug traffickers is going to bebeneficial to us.''   But in Dallas, some gun store owners predicted the ban onimported assault rifles will increase weapons sales.   ``I'll probably have 200 calls tomorrow,'' said Charles Zuber,owner of Guns Unlimited. ``Anytime you tell people they can't havesomething, they want to have it.''</TEXT></DOC>
