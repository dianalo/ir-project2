As the wineslowly matures, it becomes smoother, fuller, more developed. Harsh reds losetheir tannins and sweet whites become lush and honeylike.;   Unless you areprepared to pay premium prices for already-aged wine, the cellaring processhas to begin at home. And for most, that presents a problem. Where do youstore wine in a home that has no temperature-controlled cellar or storagespace? What is a condo or homeowner without a basement supposed to do?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE; HERE'S HOW TO CELLAR WINES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Wine; Chart attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     One favorite storage spot is a seldom-used closet, especially if centralair conditioning duct work passes it. If you have a closet with an exteriorwall, you might install a small air conditioner in it to maintain a cooltemperature. Another favorite storage area is under a stairway. Other peoplestore their wine under the bed.;   But avoid storing wine in the kitchen.Designers seem to like to put wine racks in the kitchen as a decorativeelement, but the temperatures in the kitchen are not appropriate for winestorage.;   Whatever the location you select for your home wine &quot;cellar,&quot; keepthese points in mind:;   (check) Choose a place that is usually dark. Exposureto light, over a period of time, can damage wine.;   (check) Select a localethat is subject to minimal vibration. Excessive shaking is unsettling to wineand can distort the maturation process.;   (check) Avoid a location that istoo dry. In an arid environment, the corks in wine bottles shrink and air getsinto the bottles, ultimately spoiling the wine.;   (check) Try to maintainconstant temperature. Temperature is the single most important factor toconsider when planning a storage area for wine. Ideally, wine should be storedbetween 50 and 57 degrees. If that ideal is impractical, the next best thingis to store the wine in an area where the temperature rarely varies and isneither too hot nor too cold. Heat (above 75 degrees) can coarsen wine,causing it to mature too rapidly, and destroy much of its flavor. Cold (below45 degrees) will stifle and dull the development of your wine.;   Once you'veselected the location for your &quot;cellar,&quot; remember to store your wine on itsside so that the cork in the bottle has contact with the wine inside. Withoutthat contact, the corks may dry out and contract, allowing air to enter thebottle and spoil the wine. Storage bins can be as simple as cardboard boxesfrom liquor stores or more elaborate wooden storage units.;   Red wines worthyof cellaring include most California cabernet sauvignons, zinfandels and pinotnoirs; virtually all French bordeaux and burgundies; some Spanish reds(notably Reservas and Gran Reservas from Rioja and premium reds from Penedes)and some Italian reds (namely Barolo, Amarone and a few other expensiveselections).;   White wines that will benefit from storage includehigher-priced California chardonnays and late-harvest johannisberg rieslings;French sauternes and barsacs; and German Ausleses, Beerenausleses, andTrockenbeerenausleses.;   Don't bother storing everyday, inexpensive wines;save your space for better wines that may need years to fully mature. Alsoremember that many wines, by their nature, are meant to be enjoyed while theyare young and should not be stored for more than six months to a year. Thislist includes roses, beaujolais, California chenin blancs, French Loire wines,Italian and Spanish whites and all champagnes.;   How long will the wine last?The longevity potential for any wine is anyone's guess. The only way todiscover if a wine is reaching its peak -- or has gone over it -- is to tasteit. See chart for guidelines on the aging potential for popular varietals.;  Remember that these are only guidelines and there will always be exceptions tothe rule. If the cellar temperature is 50 to 57 degrees, for example, greatbordeaux can maintain their qualities for 50 to 75 years; GermanTrockenbeerenausleses have been known to survive for more than 300 years.;  If the temperature is higher than the 70 degrees used for this chart, then thewine's lifespan will be reduced considerably. No matter what the temperatureor storage conditions, cellar owners should regularly sample their wine to seehow they are holding up. In the end, only a taste, not guesswork, will tell ifa wine is aging well.; Cellar potential; Here are potential aging times forpremium wines of very good vintage years, stored in a cellar with a fairlyconstant temperature of 70 degrees:; Varietal            Years; Cabernetsauvignon        15-20; Pinot noir                 8-10; Zinfandel (red)          10-15; Bordeaux (red)            20-25; Burgundy (red)            10-15;Premium Italian reds      15-25; Late-harvest rieslings    15-20; Sauternes andamp;barsacs       20-30; German ausleses           10-15; German beerenausleses andamp;Trockenbeerenausleses     20-40; Chardonnay                 5-10; Burgundy(white)           5-10; Source:   Bob Hosmon; Mercury News  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BOB HOSMON, Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910925  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  836  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 25, 199100269125,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
