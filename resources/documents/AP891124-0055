Pvts. Andrei Lopukh and Valery Prokapchuk, both 20, will be thefirst Soviet prisoners of war released since the Red Army endednine years of involvement in Afghanistan's civil war in February,officials said.   Soviet diplomats said both were captured in 1987, but Afghanrebels earlier claimed Lopukh had deserted to their side.   They will be released within days under arrangements nearlycompleted among Afghan rebels, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry and theInternational Committee of the Red Cross, the diplomats said.   Maria Lopukh of Byelorussia and Valentina Prokapchuk of theUkraine wept as they arrived by chartered Aeroflot jet with afive-member delegation including parents of other soldiers missingin Afghanistan.   They declined to speak with reporters.   ``These are two very simple, plain Russian women _ sufferingwomen who thought they had lost their sons,'' said Iona Andronov,spokesman of Nadezhka (Hope), a private group that works for therelease of Soviet POWs. ``But they soon will become the happiestwomen in the world.''   Soviet diplomats called the release a ``goodwill gesture'' bythe rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors, who for11 years have fought to topple successive, Soviet-backedgovernments in Kabul.   The diplomats refused to describe it as a prisoner exchange, buthinted that Moscow was prepared to help lobby for the release ofsome rebel prisoners held by Afghan Communists.   ``This is completely a humanitarian issue but if you are doingsomething good for the Russian people, something will happen,''Andronov said.   Moscow claims about 310 of its men are unaccounted for inAfghanistan. The rebels say they are holding no more than 75.   The insurgents, backed primarily by Pakistan and the UnitedStates, claim the Kabul government is holding as many as 35,000rebel prisoners, many in the notorious Pul-i-Charki prison complexoutside the Afghan capital.   The insurgents offered to release Lopukh when Andronov brought adelegation to the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar in June.   However, the former soldier told a news conference he wouldn'tgo home until Kabul freed all rebel prisoners. He said he hadbecome a Moslem, and was unsure if he wanted to go home.   Soviet forces fought to prop up Afghanistan's Marxists, whoseized power in a 1978 coup, between December 1979 and February1989. Moscow continues massive military aid to Kabul.   Government forces still control the country's major cities, butthe rebels have virtual free run of the countryside. The insurgentsrefuse to talk peace with Kabul officials, whom they blame forinviting the Soviet intervention.</TEXT></DOC>
