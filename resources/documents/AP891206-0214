The company said it was soliciting bids to build and install atension leg platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2,860 feet of water,which is more than half a mile deep. Shell said it would be a worldwater-depth record.   The tension leg platform, which employs a relatively new type oftechnology, will be in the Gulf about 255 miles southeast ofHouston.   Last month, a tension leg platform built by Conoco Inc. in theGulf in 1,760 feet of water was declared operational. It is theworld's deepest oil and natural gas production platform inoperation.   Houston-based Shell, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal DutchShell in The Netherlands, said the cost of the ``Auger'' project,estimated at $1.1 billion, will include fabrication andinstallation of the platform, development drilling, completeproduction facilities and pipelines.   ``The Auger TLP (tension leg platform) represents another giantstep toward narrowing the gap between the industry's ability toexplore and its ability to produce,'' said Frank H. Richardson,president of Shell Oil. ``This project exemplifies Shell'scontinuing commitment to develop the technology necessary toproduce our nation's frontier oil and gas reserves.''   Shell said the platform will be the first Gulf of Mexico tensionleg platform to support a drilling rig and complete productionfacilities.   Initial development will begin about mid-1990, and the drillingrig and production facilities will be installed in 1993. The rigwill have 32 well slots.   The facility will be able to drill 15,000 to 20,000 feetsub-sea, Shell officials said.   Production is expected to begin in 1993 and will increase to aprojected peak rate of 40,000 barrels of oil per day in 1995, and150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the year 2001.   A tension platform rig floats at the surface of the water and isconnected to a foundation template on the sea floor by tubularsteel tendons. The buoyancy of the platform creates an upward forcethat puts the tendons in tension, eliminating vertical motion andholding the platform in place.</TEXT></DOC>
