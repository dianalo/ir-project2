One worker was killed and 11 were injured in the July blaze atKelly Air Force Base.   The notice Tuesday from the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration includes 16 ``willful'' violations and two``serious'' ones. No fines were imposed because the Air Force is afederal agency.   OSHA did not pinpoint the the fire's cause but found severalhazards were present. Among the violations cited were cigarettebutts found within a 50-foot safety zone. However, OSHA did notallege that workers were smoking.   OSHA also said an ``integral tank tool kit'' was not availablefor testing one of the plane's fuel tanks. L. Nicholas, theagency's area director, refused to elaborate today on how the lackof proper tools related to the accident.   The Air Force has until Dec. 11 to correct some violations butmust correct others as soon as Monday.   Maj. Gen. Richard Smith, commander of the Air Logistics Center,said in a statement today that the OSHA citations parallel the AirForce's own findings and that ``corrective actions are already inprogress.''   The Air Force blamed the accident on an improperly constructed,unapproved fuel tank vent plug mistakenly left on a fuel tank afterthe tank was tested for leaks. That caused the tank to burst whenfilled, according to the military.   OSHA also charged that the fire guard had left the refuelingarea and was not present to detect leaking fuel and give a warning,and that supervisors didn't brief the refueling crew, discussescape routes or designate one person to direct refueling.</TEXT></DOC>
