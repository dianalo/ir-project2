(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An appeals court on Friday reversed a judge'sruling that a small town school district's ban on dancing violatedthe constitutional separation of church and state, paving the wayfor the Purdy school board to resume its ban.   The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in St. Louis is ``a victory for losers and hypocrites,''a plaintiff in the case said Friday, and her attorney vowed toappeal.   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled in August 1988 that thenearly century-old ban on dancing at the Purdy schoolunconstitutionally promoted the values of residents who opposeddancing for religious reasons. Clark said he did not believe theboard's claim that the ban was simply a policy matter.   The school board had said it supported the ban not because ofreligion, but because of possible drinking and discipline problemsand because it was an unnecessary expense.   Although the school board appealed Clark's ruling it allowedstudents to hold a homecoming dance last December.   The case drew wide attention in part because of the similaritiesto the hit motion picture ``Footloose.''   The 8th Circuit panel noted Friday that many of the 900 residentsof Purdy, a Ozarks mountain town in southwestern Missouri, werereligious conservatives. But the judges panel said there was nounconstitutional mingling of church and state just because the banadhered to the conservatives' religious views.   ``We simply do not believe elected government officials arerequired to check at the door whatever religious background ... theycarry with them before they act on rules that are otherwiseunobjectionable under the controlling ... standards,'' the panelsaid.   The appeals court said the plaintiffs should support school boardcandidates whose views mirror their own instead of going to thecourts.   ``Political divisiveness along religious lines ... is not aproper consideration except in cases involving financial aid toparochial schools,'' the appeals panel said.   Ransom Ellis, an attorney for the school district, said he waspleased with the new ruling. ``I know that the school board and thedefendants in the case were also very pleased,'' he said.   But William Fleischaker, an attorney representing students andparents who sued to have the near century-old ban revoked, said hewould ask the full nine-judge appeals court to consider the case andthat he would take it to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.   The appeals panel ``ignored in its finding the vast amount ofevidence that the school board, in retaining the (dance ban), actedwith specific intent to promote a religious view,'' Fleischaker said.   Joan Fox, one of the parents in Purdy who sued to have the banrevoked, was outraged at Friday's ruling.   ``I think it's a victory for losers and hypocrites in a communitywhere cowardice and bigotry sustains them,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
