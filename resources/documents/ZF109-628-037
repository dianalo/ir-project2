 Thefollow-on to IBM's 370 architecture has been the topic for speculation foryears.andP;  When it finally arrived in early September, the roll-out carried withit th largest product release in more than 25 years.andM;The S/390 brings with it a set of new operating systems, a new clusteringarchitecture, a set of new Enterprise System/9000 processors, enhancednetwork services (management, security, distributed data and timesynchronization), and enhancements to the Systems Application Architecture(SAA) APIs.andP;  It also signifies a new approach to system/network management,as well as a number of new and enhanced products in this area (see thisissue's feature article).andM;We'll leave the discussion of the processor family for another place.andO;Suffice it to say for now that the new ES/9000s deliver a 100-foldperformance range across the line with attractive increases in theprice/performance of the systems.andP;  Prices for the larger systems can be up to23 percent lower than comparable 3090 Model J processors.andP;  In the mmi and lowrange, prices for the ES/9000s can be up to 50 percent lower than those ofthe 4381s and 9370s.andM;IBM used a wealth of new technology to deliver the ES/9000 family.andP;  Thecurrent high end, the ES/9000 Model 900, delivers 1.7 to 1.9 times theprocessor performance of the 3090 Model 600 J in commercial applications; 2.0to 2.7 times its performance in scalar; and 2.0 to 2.8 times its performancein vector supercomputing.andM;ESCON ARCHITECTURE.andP;  The Enterprise System Connection (ESCON) architectureuses high-speed fiber optic channels to interconnect hosts and peripheraldevices up to 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) away at up to 10 MB per second.andP;  Thisis IBM's first major advance in channel architecture since the introductionof the parallel channel with the S/360 in 1964.andM;ESCON connectivity is dynamic--customers can switch channel-to-control unitand channel-to-channel connections among several paths using the ESCONDirector.andP;  The Director currently comes in two models: The Model 1 is adesktop device wtih 8 ports (upgradeable to 12 or 16 ports).andP;  Thefloor-standing Model 2 comes with 28 ports, upgradeable to 60 ports in 4-portincrements.andM;ESCON channels are available on the ES/9000s and on most 3090 Model Jprocessors as well.andP;  The 3990 Models 2 and 3 storage units, all models of the3490 mag tape subsystem, and two models of the 3174 have built-in ESCONcapability.andM;A converter translates parallel channel protocols into ESCON channelprotocols for accommodating customers with current control units.andM;IBM has announced a future field upgrade to deliver ESCON support for the3745 family.andP;  Until then, customers must use the converter.andM;CONTROLLERS.andP;  The announcements include new and enhanced controllers.andM;3172 Interconnect Controller Model 2.andP;  The new 3172 controller attachesmultiple LANs to multiple hosts.andP;  The Model 2 supports fiber distributed datainterface (FDDI)--IBM's first product to do so--and supports Open SystemsInterconnect (OSI) as well as Systems Network Architecture (SNA).andM;3174 Enhancements.andP;  The new and enhanced 3174 controllers and support for theESCON architecture, linking up to eight hosts through one fiber optic link.andO;They also have doubled the coax capability, supporting up to 64 directlyattached devices instead of theprevious 32.andM;A new 3299 terminal mux allows attachment of up to 32 devices to large 3174models.andP;  It linkds to the 3174 using fiber as well as copper coax and the IBMcabling system.andM;Token-Ring workstations can access up to three hosts concurrently through asingle 3174 gateway.andM;3745 Enhancements.andP;  IBM has enhanced the performance of the 3745 controllers.andO;All four channel-attached models will deliver a 25 percent improvement forbatch processing to customers.andP;  In the future, IBM will deliver ESCONsupport.andM;NEW RELEASE OF VTAM.andP;  Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM) Version3 Release 3 for the new VSE/ESA and VM/ESA operating systems enables largerprograms and bigger networks.andP;  VM users now have virtual storage of up to2GB, up from 16 MB.andP;  On VSE/ESA systems, VTAM occupies its own privateaddress space on the host, freeing up more space and accommodating largerapplications and more complex networks.andM;VTAM Version 3 Release 4 goes on to support direct communication between hostapplication and SNA devices on several types of LANs, including FDDI.andO;furthermore, customers can add new devices to networkds without disruptingnetwork operation.andM;LAN SOLUTIONS.andP;  Announcements in the LAN area include:andM;8230 Controlled Access Unit (CAU).andP;  The 8230 Controlled Access Unit (CAU) isa LAN device attachment unit that can identify and isolate a malfunctioningnode, and automatically recover or remove and bypass the failing component.andO;The 8230 will then notify NetView of the problem (via the LAN Networkmanager).andM;It supports up to 80 LAN-attached devices in increments of 20 attachments permodule, and supports greater cabling distances than the 8228.andM;LAN Network Manager.andP;  LAN Network Manager Versions 1.0 and 1.1 manage LANs atthe workstaion level and/or with NetView on a host computer.andP;  All LAN NetworkManager products can inventory, track, and control access to devices in eachLAN.andM;LAN Station Manager.andP;  LAN Station Manager collects device information fromeach customer workstation and forwards it to the LAN Network Manager.andM;8209 LAN Bridge Enhancements.andP;  The enhanced 8209 allows LAN Network Managerto manage Token-Ring LANS connected through an Ethernet LAN.andM;WAN Program.andP;  The new wide area network (WAN) program supports Token-Ring, PCNetwork Baseband and Broadband, and Ethernet LANs over an SNA backbone.andM;COMMON CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARCHITECTURE (CCA).andP;  Common Cryptographic Architecture(CCA) provides a consistent cryptographic application programming interfacefor MVS and DOS applications.andP;  Developers write applications that will workin supported systems environments with minimal change.andP;  CCA provides:andM;* Data Integrity services, via Message Authentication Code (MAC) andModification Detection Code (MDC) generationandM;* Data confidentiality services, supplying encryption, decryption, andciphertext translationandM;* PIN processing servicesandM;* Management servicesandM;New integrated cryptographic features (ICRF) in the host support the CCA.andM;NEW DISTRIBUTED DATABASE SOLUTIONS.andP;  IBM introduced new releases of DB2 andSQL/DS that implement the distributed Remote-Unit-of-Work (RTUOW) under thenewly introduced Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA).andP;  Userswill be able to request data that the system will retrieve automatically,regardless of storage site.andP;  Customers can distribute data among DB2 ssytemsunder MVS and SQL/DS relational systems under VM.andM;DRDA will provide the basis for RUOW support for OS/2 Extended Edition (EE)and OS/400.andM;A new SAA LanguageAccess natural-language query translates user requests intoSQL for Query Management Facility (QMF).andP;  QMF then retrieves the information.andM;SAA.andP;  IBM never claimed that SAA was static.andP;  This series of announcementsproves that with some major extensions and enhancements.andM;Extensions.andP;  IBM added a new Resource Recovery Interface (RRI) that definesservices that enable the use of two-phase commitment control protocols fordistributed database work.andM;The Communications Interface now has support for synch points, and there is anew level of database interface that includes protocols for distributedrelational data and enhanced support for ANSI, ISO and FIPS standards.andP;  Thenew CPI for the Database Interface includes Referential Integrity, common SQLreturn codes, and a PL/I interface.andM;New Architectures Implemented.andP;  Announced in June, these four SAAarchitectures are now implemented in the new database products:andM;* Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA), which allows accessand use of data in interconnected networks implementing DRDAandM;* Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDMA)andM;* Formatted Data Object Content Architecture (FD:OCA), an extension toInformation Interchange Architecture (IIA) that provides a consistent way todescribe and exchange field-formatted dataandM;* Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA), which ensures that allcharacters and symbols have the same representation across any pair of SAADBMSsandM;COMMENTS.andP;  IBM has said it before, but it selected this announcement toreinforce its commitments to distributed computing environments with a set ofproducts that put more pieces of the transparent network into place.andM;In addition to the raw performance enhancements of the new processors andcontrollers, IBM continues to increase the ability of customers to create andto support heterogeneity in their networks.andM;The new IBM products bring FDDI to the table for the first time, and augmentsupport for Ethernet and OSI.andP;  The new network and system administrationproducts are extremely significant, as are the enhancements to thedistributed data services and the new cryptographic architecture.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
