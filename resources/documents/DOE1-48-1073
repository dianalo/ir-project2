The model is basedon a perturbation solution of the adjoint problem to the Fokker--Planckequation and includes the effect of the continuous wave spectrum. Itindicates that the dependence of the current drive efficiency on thedc electric field is determined only by the wave accessibility condition.The model's results are found to agree with the ASDEX tokamak lower-hybridexperimental data [Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 27, 1399 (1985)] aswell as the newly developed two-dimensional Fokker--Planck code results.The predictions lie within an experimental scattering of about 20%.</TEXT></DOC>
