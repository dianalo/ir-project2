 In fact, the first Soviet high-speed computer, the BESM-6, whichwent into production more than 20 years ago, still is used because attemptsto replace it have met with limited success.andP;  This has hampered Sovietefforts in military and scientific areas where world-class research requiresintensive computing.andM;To date, most Eastern bloc computer development has been under the auspicesof the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, established in 1969.andO;Participating countries are assigned specific fields for research anddevelopment, such as production control in Czechoslovakia and computer-aideddesign in Bulgaria.andM;Not for ExportandM;At a recent meeting, Soviet technocrats spoke cautiously about their owndevelopments, such as 32-bit reduced-instruction-set computer chips.andO;Referring to Western nations' export controls, one said: &quot;When the technologyis banned to us, then we are forced to develop our own.&quot;andP;  He acknowledgedthat the Soviet Union had poor manufacturing capabilities and produced fewexport-quality goods.andM;The Soviet Union's Ryad or ES Series of mainframes is based on theinstruction set and I/O bus of the IBM 360 and 370 architectures, butdevelopment has been limited by the shortfall in very large-scale integratedchip design.andM;The central processing unit is based on Russia's KR-1800 series chip, whichis downwardly compatible with the K-500 microprocessors.andP;  The data transferrate of 2 megabytes per second is well above the embargo levl of 1.2megabytes per second.andP;  But the Western embargo has limited fixed, internalstorage at 256K, compared with the 1 megabyte generally available in theWest.andM;The Soviet Union's SM Series minicomputers have centered on chip-setimplementation of Digital Equipment Corp's PSP/11, later extended to'para-products' of the VAX range and machines from other vendors, notablyHoneywell-Bull.andM;The installed base of SM minis is about 75,000, of which about 40 percent areused to control production manufacturing.andP;  Real-time operating systems aresubject to total embargo.andM;Georgi Bukharov, director of the programming cooperative Takt, describedimport restrictions as ineffective and unnecessary.andP;  &quot;The embargo is foolishbecause it doesn't work,&quot; he said.andM;The Western embargo has encouraged software piracy on a massive scale, andthere are many Russian versions of pupolar PC packages.andP;  The American vendorAutodesk in Sausalito, Calif., claims that its autoCAD CAD/CAM package isused widely in the Soviet Union but that few copies are legal.andM;In the microcomputing arena, three Soviet ministres are involved in theproduction of PC compatibles: Minradioprom, the radio industry; Minpribor,instrument-making; and Minpromisvyazi, communications.andP;  Current estimatessuggest total output in the Soviet Union is only several thousand per month.andM;The nation also produces an 8-bit micro, the Agat, and non-compatible 16-bitmachines, the Elektronikas.andP;  Standardization on the KR1810 processor, ananalog of the Intel 8086 has been agreed to in the Eastern bloc, a move thatis expected to increase production.andM;200,000 PCsandM;Russia claims to have about 200,000 PCs, many of them domestically producedIBM PC clones, for its 280 million citizens.andP;  The United States has about 30million.andM;Apart from education, the market in the Soviet Union for PCs most likely isto be in newly established cooperatives.andP;  Officials here say they wouldprefer to establish technology exchanges and joint ventures with the West,rather than purchase large quantities of redundant technology.andM;The first such joint venture was announced in January 1988, between a groupof Soviet organizations and An American electronics firm, MPI, of Laurens,S.C., for a manufacturing facility in Naberezhniye Chelny.andM;American PC manufacturers Apple Computer Inc. and Televideo Systems Inc. alsomade deals with the Russians.andP;  Televideo of Sunnyvale, Calif., through itssubsidiary Advanced Transducer Devices, is forming a joint PC manufacturingventure with a Russian electronics giant.andM;This venture may becomes one of Europe's largest PC manufacturers, withannual sales exceeding $100 million in a few years.andM;More recently, MicroPro International Corp. of San Rafael, Calif., theAmerican developer of WordStar, agreed to develoed jointly with Russianprogrammers a Russian language version of the word processing program.andM;Another American vendor, Dataease Intrenational Inc., Trumbull, Conn.,andO;reported it had a deal with the Soviets to sell Russian-language versions ofits products.andM;Boris Naumov, director of the Soviet Union's Institute of InformaticsProblems, said the long-term in the Soviet economy will be for 28 millionPCs.andP;  &quot;Our aim is to achieve this installation level by the year 2000,&quot; hesaid.andM;This is calculated as an average requirement of about 2 million a year, butthe bulk of this requirement will be met by internal production, eitherexclusively using Soviet technology or production in partnership with Westerncompanies.andM;The Soviet Union's five-year plan calls for the installation of 1 million PCsby the end of 1990 in 65,000 secondary schools.andP;  Current domestic productionis able only to meet an estimated one-quarter of this target.andM;While the United States has blocked the export of many hardware and softwareproducts to the Soviets, PCs as powerful as the 12.5-MHz IBM PC AT now can besold legally in the Soviet Union.andP;  Even with the new relaxation in Westernnation's license rules, licenses still are required for 10-MHz 8086 XTcompatibles.andM;Early SuccessandM;At presents, no fewer than 73 brands of PCs are being marketed actively inthe Soviet Union.andP;  Many of the players are Far Eastern makers.andP;  The largestcontract to date, for 150,00 MSX machines, went to the Japanese makerSindjidaisha.andP;  However, Cyrillic versions of standard software packages forMS-DOS will accelerate the move toward IBM compatibles.andM;Obviously, makers of the cheaper clones might hope to sell in volume.andO;British maker Amstrad has met with some early success.andP;  But the currentleaders, the major American and European hardware manufacturers, continue todominate.andP;  The overall leader, in all hardware sectors, is reckoned to beBull, followed by Siemens, Britain's ICL, IBM, Nokia and DEC.andM;Russia remains one of the few places in the world where ICL outsells IBM.andO;DEC, number two in worldwide computer sales, pulled out of Moscow four yearsago.andM;As yet there are no computer systems dealers in the Soviet Union, so saleshave to be made direct to users.andP;  This situation forces a company to act asboth the distributor and dealer.andP;  The company supplies complete service inthe same way a systems dealer does in the West.andP;  Those companies that want tobuy from the Soviets have the best chance of selling to them.andM;Technology swaps are not as one-sided as one might think.andP;  The Soviet Unioncarries out more pure research and files more parents than is is widely knownor broadcast.andM;Unappreciated TechnologyandM;One company, whose main activity is researching Soviet technology for use inthe West, reports that the Soviets already have laboratory holographicdigital-storage systems.andM;Apparently, the potential storage capability of these 3-D systems could dwarfeven the largest optical disk.andM;John Baxter, marketing director of the American manufacturing and tradingcompany Satra, suggested that the Soviets' lack of market orientationeventually might result in the development of new products.andM;In fact, he suggested that pure research developments and inventions just maybe waiting for Western companies to pick them up and turn them intomarketable products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
