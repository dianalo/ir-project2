The measure, approved on a 62-28 vote, would revamp the government's program for enriching, or refining, uranium to help it compete with foreign uranium suppliers. If the enrichment program were back on its feet, it's hoped that private companies that mine and mill uranium also would enjoy a rebound. The uranium industry supplies fuel for nuclear power plants and radioactive materials for defense purposes.    Although there's a consensus that the uranium industry has big problems, prospects are dim that any rescue plan will become law this year. With legislative time running out, the House has taken no action on the issue; if Congress doesn't enact a bill by the end of the year, the process has to begin over again in both House and Senate. And the Reagan administration has threatened to veto the bill because it imposes import restrictions on foreign uranium.    Both the uranium and utility industries support the Senate bill.    The U.S. uranium industry has been damaged over the past decade by new foreign competitors offering lower prices and by decisions made by the Department of Energy in running the plants that turn U.S. uranium into nuclear fuel.    The bill would begin the process of taking the government's enrichment program private, in an effort to turn it back into a money-maker. The program would shed its two operating enrichment plants -- in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky. -- and move its uranium stockpiles into a separate, government-owned corporation.    Among the bill's most controversial provisions is one that would settle an accounting dispute over whether $8.8 billion invested in the enrichment plants is still owed to the U.S. Treasury. Taxpayer and environmental groups, claiming that writing off the debt would be a giant bailout for the nuclear industry, argued that nuclear plants should pay the disputed amount -- or at least $3 billion of it.    The Senate, however, decided that nuclear plants and their customers should pay only $364 million in back expenses. However, it accepted a compromise under which any profits generated by the new corporation would go to the Treasury to pay off another $3 billion of the unrepaid investment.    Another much disputed part of the bill, accepted by the Senate by a 47-45 margin, would impose charges on utilities that load their reactors with more than 37.5% foreign uranium. Supporters said the provision would help shore up the domestic uranium industry. Charges would be phased out by the year 2000.    But the administration opposes the import restrictions because they are protectionist and in conflict with the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement, according to Anson Franklin, an Energy Department assistant secretary. &quot;If that stayed in, I think it would be very difficult for the president to approve what otherwise is a good bill,&quot; he said.    Under the bill, the federal government would subsidize a $1 billion fund, also supported by industry, to clean up piles of uranium mill tailings at private plant sites in seven Western states. The tailings, which are wastes left over from processing uranium ore, are mildly radioactive and emit cancer-causing radon gas. </TEXT></DOC>
