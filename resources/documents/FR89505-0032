Section 133 ofthe NWPA states, in part, that ``the Commission shall, by rule, establishprocedures for the licensing of any technology approved by the Commissionunder section 218(a) for use at the site of any civilian nuclear powerreactor.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion  </ITAG>This proposed rule would allow power reactor licensees to store spent fuelat the reactor site without additional site-specific reviews. A generallicense would be issued to holders of power reactor licenses for the storageof spent fuel in dry casks approved by the NRC. The reactor licensee wouldhave to show that there are no changes required in the facility technicalspecifications or unreviewed safety questions related to activities involvingstorage of spent fuel under the general license. The licensee would alsohave to show conformance with conditions of the NRC Certificate of Complianceissued for the cask. The licensee would have to establish and maintainrecords showing compliance, which would have to be made available for inspectionby the Commission. This proposed rule would not limit storage of spent fuel to that whichis generated at the reactor site. Transfers of spent fuel from one reactorsite to another are authorized under the receiving site's facility operatinglicense pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50. The holder of a reactor operating licensewould apply for a license amendment, under andSection; 50.90 unless alreadyauthorized in the operating license, for the receipt and handling of thespent fuel from another reactor. If transfer of spent fuel is authorized,the reactor licensee would also have to make a request for amendment ofthe Price-Anderson indemnification agreement to provide for coverage ofthe transferred spent fuel. 10 CFR Part 72 is not germane to such transfersof spent fuel. If the spent fuel has been previously transferred and iscurrently stored in the reactor spent fuel pool, the only considerationunder the general license would be whether or not the spent fuel meetsconditions of the cask's Certificate of Compliance.  Although experience with storage of spent fuel under water is greater thanwith dry storage in casks, experience with storage of spent fuel in drycasks is extensive and widespread. The Canadians have been storing dryCANDU-type spent fuel at Whiteshell in vertical concrete casks called silossince 1975. Although the storage of spent fuel at Whiteshell does not involvelight-water-reactor (LWR) fuel, it has contributed to the knowledge andexperience of dry spent fuel storage in concrete casks. Dry cask storagehas been demonstrated in West Germany. There has also been experience withdry spent fuel storage in the United States. The Department of Energy (DOE)and its predecessors have kept non-LWR spent fuel in dry storage in vaultsand dry wells since the 1960s. An NRC survey of the dry storage of spentfuel, in the United States and elsewhere, was presented in NUREG/CR-1223,``Dry Storage of Spent Fuel A Preliminary Survey of Existing Technologyand Experience'' (April 1980). NUREG/CR-1223, at Section IV.C, containsa description of DOE demonstration of dry LWR spent fuel storage in sealedstorage casks (SSC) and dry wells. The storage of LWR spent fuel in SSC,which is an above ground, steel-lined, reinforced concrete cylinder orcask, started in 1979. The DOE demonstration program has continued andhas been expanded to include dry storage in metal casks and storage ofconsolidated fuel rods; and storage of spent fuel assemblies. Programshave been conducted by DOE in cooperation with Virginia Power at its Surryplant, with Carolina Power and Light at its H.B. Robinson 2 plant, andwith General Electric at its Morris plant for dry storage of LWR spentfuel. Also dry storage of LWR spent fuel assemblies continues at the IdahoNational Engineering Laboratory, along with demonstration of their disassemblyand storage of the consolidated fuel rods.The NRC staff has obtained a substantive amount of information from theDOE development programs. It has also gained experience from the issuanceof licenses for the onsite storage of spent fuel in nodular cast iron casksat the Surry site of Virginia Power and in stainless steel canisters storedinside concrete modules at the H.B. Robinson 2 site of Carolina Power andLight. The safety of dry storage of spent fuel was considered during developmentof the Commission's original regulations in 10 CFR Part 72, ``LicensingRequirements for the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Spent FuelStorage Installation (ISFSI),'' which was promulgated on November 12, 1980(45 FR 74693). A final rule entitled, ``Licensing Requirements for theIndependent Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste,''which replaced the regulations issued on November 12, 1980, was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 19, 1988 (53 FR 31651) and became effectiveSeptember 19, 1988. This final rule was issued mainly to provide for licensingthe storage of spent fuel and high-level waste at a monitored retrievablestorage (MRS) facility, and does not cover the mandates of sections 133and 218(a) of the NWPA. However, it did specifically address the safetyof dry storage of spent fuel. Activities related to loading and unloading spent fuel casks are routineprocedures at power reactors. The procedures for dry storage of spent fuelin casks would be an extension of these procedures. Over the last severalyears the staff has reviewed and approved four spent fuel storage caskdesigns. Requests for approval of cask designs are currently submittedin the form of topical safety analysis reports (TSARs). Four dry storagecask TSARs have been approved for referencing, which means that an ISFSIlicense applicant may reference appropriate parts of these reports in licensingproceedings for the storage of spent fuel. This greatly reduces an ISFSIlicense applicant's time, effort, and cost. The same reliance on an approvedsafety analysis is being made for on-site dry cask storage. Separate topical safety analysis reports have been received for designof casks fabricated using nodular cast iron, thick-walled ferritic steel,concrete, and stainless steel and lead. Four spent fuel storage cask topicalsafety analysis reports have been approved for referencing in specificlicense applications, as previously mentioned, and four are still underreview at the present time. In particular, the topical safety analysisreport (TSAR) for the Castor-V/21, entitled ``Topical Safety Analysis Reportfor the Castor Cask, Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (Dry Storage),''was submitted by General Nuclear Systems, Inc. on December 16, 1983. TheNRC staff approved the Castor-V/21 TSAR for reference in licensing proceedingson September 30, 1985. In a specific licensing proceeding under Part 72by Virginia Electric Power Company (VEPCo) in January of 1985, the useof the Castor-V/21 was approved on July 7, 1986 for storage of spent fuelat their Surry Power Station. Currently, there are seven of these casksfilled and stored on the ISFSI pad at the Surry site and an eighth caskis filled and ready to be moved to the storage pad. Although the Castor-V/21, is the only spent fuel storage cask currentlybeing used, the SARs for the Westinghouse MC-10, and the Nuclear AssuranceCorporation's NAC/ST and NAC-C28 S/T casks have been approved for reference.These casks are being proposed for approval under andSection; 72.214, ``Listof approved spent fuel storage casks.'' While the Certificate of Compliancefor each cask may differ in some specifics, e.g., certificate number; operatingprocedures; training exercises; spent fuel specifications, many of thesafety conditions are very similar. Copies of the Certificates of Complianceare being issued for comment, and are available for inspection and copyingfor a fee at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street NW.,Washington, DC, Lower Level. Single copies of the proposed certificatesmay be obtained from J.P. Roberts, Fuel Cycle Safety Branch, Division ofIndustrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, Office of Nuclear Materials Safetyand Safeguards; (Telephone: (301)492-0608). Storage casks certified in the future will be routinely added to the listingin andSection; 72.214 through rulemaking procedures. Since this type of rulemakingwould neither constitute a significant question of policy nor amend 10CFR Parts 0, 2, 7, 8, 9 Subpart C, or 110, the Commission concludes thatsuch additions to andSection; 72.214 may be made under the rulemaking authoritydelegated to the Executive Director for Operations. Certificates of Compliancewill be exhibited in a NUREG report issued by the NMSS staff, which willbe updated as appropriate. During review for the cask designs that are being proposed for certificationin this rulemaking, the NMSS staff considered compatibility with transportationto and disposal at DOE facilities and will continue to do so for futurecask approvals. The vendors of these casks have indicated that they willapply for approval of their casks for spent fuel transportation. Currentlythere is limited knowledge concerning specific design criteria by whichto design storage casks for minimizing the handling of spent fuel betweenthe time it is put into casks for storage at a reactor site and the timeit will be handled for storage at a monitored retrievable storage facility(MRS) or disposal at a geologic repository. However, the staff will remainin contact with DOE and will assure, to the extent practicable, that caskdesigns incorporate the latest design criteria available at the time thatthe cask design is approved or certified. The NRC experience in the review of cask design and fabrication, and licensingof spent fuel storage installations on the site of operating reactors,has been documented in part by publication of two draft regulatory guides.In April of 1986, two draft regulatory guides entitled ``Standard Formatand Content for the Safety Analysis Report for Onsite Storage of SpentFuel Storage Casks'' (Task number CE-301) and ``Standard Format and Contentfor a Topical Safety Analysis Report for a Dry Spent Fuel Storage Cask''(Task number CE-306) were issued for public comment. These draft guidesare being processed and the guide under task number CE-301 will becomeRegulatory Guide 3.62 and the one under task number CE-302 will becomeRegulatory Guide 3.61. Single copies of these draft guides may be obtainedfrom W.R. Pearson Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, Washington, DC 20555 (Telephone: (301) 492-3764).The passive nature of dry storage of spent fuel in casks provides operationalbenefits attractive to potential users. One benefit is that there is noneed to provide operating systems to purify and circulate cooling wateror other fluid. Another benefit is that the potential for corrosion ofthe fuel cladding and reaction with the fuel is reduced, because an inertatmosphere is expected to be maintained inside dry spent fuel storage casks.Because cooling of the spent fuel is a passive activity, active mechanisms,such as pumps and fans, are not required. Although Part 72 allows storageof any spent fuel over one year old, (i.e., one year since the fuel wasinvolved in a sustained nuclear chain reaction), it is anticipated thatmost spent fuel stored in casks will be five years old or more. Becauseof the passive nature of cask cooling, the storage capacity of a cask issignificantly increased as the spent fuel is aged, especially for fuelthat is five years old or more. It is probable that reactor licensees willremove the older fuel from their storage pools to take advantage of thisadditional cask storage capacity. As a result of the above discussion, the Commission believes that dry storageof spent fuel in casks approved by the Commission will provide adequateprotection to public health and safety and the environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule </ITAG>The General License Under this proposed rule, a general license would be issued to holdersof nuclear power reactor licenses to store spent fuel at reactor sitesin casks approved by the NRC. The Commission will rely on dry storage ofspent fuel in casks for confinement of radioactive material to provideadequate protection of public health and safety and the environment. Apower reactor license holder would have to notify the Commission beforestoring spent fuel under the general license for the first time and registeruse of each cask as the spent fuel is stored. A separate record would alsobe established for each cask by the cask vendor, which would be transferredto and be maintained by cask users. The reactor license holder would have to ensure that the storage of spentfuel will be in compliance with the conditions of the cask Certificateof Compliance, including assurance that site parameters and other designbases are within the envelope of the values analyzed in the cask safetyanalysis report. Evaluations would also have to be made to ensure thatthere will be no changes necessary to the facility technical specificationsand that there are no unresolved safety questions in activities involvingthe storage casks. Procedures and criteria in 10 CFR 50.59 would be usedfor these evaluations. These types of evaluation are currently done forspecific licenses issued under Part 72. Issues related to systems and componentsused both for reactor operations and spent fuel storage activities wouldbe included. Most concerns to date have been related to control of heavyloads and have been accommodated. If there is a safety problem or a changein technical specifications required, and the reactor license holder wishesto store spent fuel under the general license, the problem would have tobe resolved before storing spent fuel under the general license and couldinclude submittal of an application for license amendment under Part 50if necessary. Reactor licensees would have to review their quality assurance program,emergency plan, training program, and radiation control program using proceduresin andSection; 50.59 and modify them as may be necessary to cover the activitiesrelated to spent fuel storage under the general license. These plans andprograms are in effect for reactor operations and the appropriate existingplan or program could be modified or amended to cover activities relatedto the spent fuel storage. The reactor licensee would have to conform to conditions in the cask'sCertificate of Compliance, which includes conducting activities accordingto written operating procedures. These operating procedures could be developedusing the same or a similar system by which the operating procedures forthe reactor were developed. Instances in which significant reductions in the safety effectiveness ofor defects in casks are discovered must be reported to the NRC. Initialreports would be submitted under 10 CFR 50.72 ``Immediate notificationrequirements for operating nuclear power reactors.'' A new paragraph wouldbe added to andSection; 50.72(b)(2) for this purpose. A complete writtenreport would be submitted within 30 days. When the power reactor operating license expiration date approaches, theholder of the license must take some actions. Under 10 CFR 50.54(bb) thereactor license holder must submit a program in writing to the Commission,no later than five years prior to the license expiration date, showinghow the reactor licensee intends to manage and provide funding for themanagement of all irradiated fuel on the reactor site. This program wouldhave to include the spent fuel stored under the general license proposedin this rulemaking. The reactor licensee will also have to decide whetherto request termination of the reactor operating license under 10 CFR 50.82.If the reactor license holder decides to apply for termination of the license,the plan submitted with the application must show how the spent fuel storedunder this general license will be removed from the site. The plan wouldhave to include an explanation of when and how the spent fuel will be moved,unloaded, and shipped prior to starting decommissioning of the equipmentneeded for these activities. In part, the environmental assessment for this rulemaking relies on findingsfrom the Waste Confidence Decision (49 FR 34658, 8/31/84), in which theCommission concluded they had confidence that there would be no significantenvironmental impacts from the storage of spent fuel for a period of 30years beyond the expiration date of reactor licenses. Thus, an applicationfor reactor license termination that proposes a decommissioning periodbeyond this 30-year period would have to contain a discussion of the environmentalimpacts from storage of the spent fuel beyond the period analyzed by theCommission. The general license would terminate automatically when thespent fuel is removed from storage.  Cask Certification A spent fuel storage cask will be relied on to provide safe confinementof radioactive material independent of a nuclear power reactor's site,so long as conditions of the Certificate of Compliance are met. The storagecask approval program, in many respects, will be analogous to that nowconducted for spent fuel casks approved for transportation under 10 CFRPart 71. A cask vendor will submit a safety analysis report showing howthe cask design, fabrication, and testing will ensure adequate protectionof public health and safety. Certificates of Compliance will be exhibitedin a NUREG report, which will be made available to the public. Spent fuel is now temporarily stored at reactor sites, ISFSI, and elsewhereuntil a Department of Energy monitored retrievable storage facility orhigh-level radioactive waste repository is ready. The spent fuel will thenbe shipped to one of these facilities. Changes in the law could shift theCommission's policies or cause a change in its regulations. It appearsto be prudent that cask design approvals, i.e., approval of spent fuelcask topical safety analysis reports under current regulations; or issuanceof Certificates of Compliance under the proposed regulation, should befor a limited time period. Current regulations limit the storage of spentfuel in an ISFSI to 20 years, after which the license may be renewed. TheCommission believes that 20-year increments are appropriate for such caskdesign approvals, after which designs may be renewed. The holder of the cask Certificate of Compliance (cask vendor) should applyfor re-approval of a storage cask. Submittal of an application would bemade 17 years after the initial cask approval date, which is three yearsprior to the expiration date of the cask certificate, to allow time forthe NRC staff to reevaluate the cask safety and reissue the Cask certificate.If the holder of a cask certificate goes out of business or will not submitan application for reapproval in a timely manner for any reason, the Commissionshould be notified and it in turn would notify cask users. In any case,cask users would have to ensure that spent fuel is stored in casks approvedby the NRC. Several options would be available to licensees. If a caskdesign is reapproved under submittals by the vendor, the Commission wouldnotify all users and the only action necessary for the users would be toupdate the cask's records. If the cask vendor does not apply for reapproval,for whatever reason, the licensee would be notified by the Commission.The licensee would then have to arrange for reapproval or remove casksfrom service as their 20-year approved storage life expired. This couldmean removal of the spent fuel and storing it elsewhere.The Commission believes that a prudent concern for overall activities relatedto the back-end of the LWR fuel cycle dictates that consideration shouldbe given to the compatibility of spent fuel storage cask designs with thetransportation of the spent fuel to its ultimate disposition at a DOE facility.Cask designers should be aware of DOE developments and plans for transportationof spent fuel offsite and should design spent fuel storage casks, to theextent that is practicable given the information that is available at thetime that the cask is designed, for compatibility with future dispositionof the spent fuel. The cask designs that are included in this rulemakingcomply to the extent practicable at this time. The Commission notes thatthe vendors of these casks have indicated their intent to pursue certificationfor their cask as a shipping container for offsite transportation under10 CFR Part 71. However, spent fuel can be safely off-loaded from storagecasks at reactor sites, if necessary, at the end of the storage period.In the interest of minimizing overall fuel cycle impacts the Commissionencourages storage cask design developments that would reduce the handlingof spent fuel. The scope of this rule is to allow holders of nuclear power reactor licensesto store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites under a general license usingcertified dry storage casks, because use of these casks is essentiallyindependent of site characteristics. The Commission has evaluated and approved,in specific licenses issued under 10 CFR Part 72, other types of dry storagemodules. These methods may be approved in the future for use under a generallicense. NRC costs related to spent fuel storage cask Certificates of Compliance,cask fabrication inspections, and onsite inspections would be fully recovered.The schedule of fees in 10 CFR 170.31 would be revised to recover thesecosts. Safeguards Spent fuel removed from light water reactors contains low enriched uranium,fission products, plutonium, and other transuranium elements (transuranics).Owing to the special nuclear material in spent fuel, safeguards for anindependent spent fuel storage installation must protect against theftand radiological sabotage and must provide for material accountability.The requirements for physical protection are set forth in proposed andSection;72.212. No specific requirements for material control and accounting arebeing added because existing requirements in Parts 72 and 50 are adequate.The theft issue arises mainly from the plutonium component of the spentfuel. Plutonium, when separated from other substances, can be used in theconstruction of nuclear explosive devices and therefore must be providedwith a high level of physical protection. However, the plutonium containedin spent fuel is not readily separable from the highly radioactive fissionproducts and other transuranics and for that reason is not considered ahighly attractive material for theft. Moreover, the massive constructionof casks significantly complicates theft scenarios. For these reasons nospecific safeguards measures to protect against theft are proposed otherthan maintaining accounting records and conducting periodic inventoriesof the special nuclear material contained in the spent fuel. Safeguards measures should be consistent with existing site provisionsagainst potential radiological sabotage. The term ``radiological sabotage''is defined in 10 CFR Part 73 and means any deliberate act directed againsta plant or transport vehicle and cask in which an activity licensed underNRC regulations is conducted, or against a component of a plant or transportvehicle and cask which could directly or indirectly endanger the publichealth and safety by exposure to radiation. In assessing the probability and consequences of radiological sabotage,the NRC considers: (1) The threat to storage facilities; (2) the responseof typical storage casks or vaults and their contained spent fuel to postulatedacts of radiological sabotage; and (3) the public health consequences ofacts of radiological sabotage. The NRC has carried out studies to develop information about possible adversarygroups which might pose a threat to licensed nuclear facilities. The resultsof these studies are published in NUREG-0459, ``Generic Adversary Characteristics_SummaryReport'' (March 1979) and NUREG-0703, ``Potential Threat to Licensed NuclearActivities from Insiders'' (July 1980). Actions against facilities werefound to be limited to a number of low consequence activities and harassments,such as hoax bomb threats, vandalism, radiopharmaceutical thefts, and firearmsdischarges. The list of actions is updated annually in a NUREG-0525, ``SafeguardsSummary Event List'' (July 1987). None of the actions have affected spentfuel containment and, thus, have not caused any radiological health hazards.In addition, the NRC staff regularly consults with law enforcement agenciesand intelligence-gathering agencies to obtain their views concerning thepossible existence of adversary groups interested in radiological sabotageof commercial nuclear facilities. None of the information the staff hascollected confirms the presence of an identifiable domestic threat to drystorage facilities or to other components of nuclear facilities.Despite the absence of an identified domestic threat, the NRC has consideredit prudent to study the response of loaded casks to a range of sabotagescenarios. The study is classified. However, an overview of the study isprovided in the following paragraphs. Being highly radioactive, spent fuel requires heavy shielding for safestorage. Typical movable storage casks are of metal or concrete, weigh100 tons, and have wall thickness from 10 to 16 inches of metal or 30 inchesof concrete. The structural materials and dimensions enable the casks andvaults to withstand attack by small arms fire, pyrotechnics, mechanicalaids, high velocity objects, and most forms of explosives without releaseof spent fuel. After considering various technical approaches to radiologicalsabotage, the NRC concluded that radiological sabotage, to be successful,would have to be carried out with the aid of a large quantity of explosives.The consequences to the public health and safety would stem almost exclusivelyfrom the fraction of the release that is composed of respirable particles.In an NRC study, an experiment was carried out to evaluate the effectsof a very severe, perfectly executed explosive sabotage scenario againsta simulated storage cask containing spent fuel assemblies. The amount offuel disrupted was measured. The fraction of disrupted material of respirabledimensions (0.005%) had been determined in a previous experiment. Fromthis information, an estimate of the airborne, respirable release was made,and the dose as a function of range and other variables was calculated.In a typical situation, for an individual at the boundary of the reactorsite (taken as 100 meters from the location of the release) and in thecenter of the airborne plume, the whole-body dose was calculated to be1 rem and the 50-year dose commitment (to the lung, which is the most sensitiveorgan) was calculated to be 2 rem. Doses higher or lower can be obtaineddepending on the variables used in the calculation. Variables include themeteorological conditions, the age and burn-up of the fuel, the heat-inducedbuoyancy of the airborne release, the range to the affected individual,and the explosive scenario assumed.  Although the experiment and calculations carried out lead to a conclusionof low public health consequences, there are limitations that must be takeninto account. In particular, consequence modeling assumptions more severethan those in the foregoing calculation are possible if unconstrained sabotageresources or protracted loss of control of the storage site are allowed.For that reason, protection requirements are proposed to provide for (1)early detection of malevolent moves against the storage site, and (2) ameans to quickly summon response resources to assure against protractedloss of control of the site. The proposed requirements comprise a subset of the overall protection requirementscurrently in force at every operating nuclear power reactor. Inasmuch asthe security force at each reactor is thoroughly familiar with requirementssimilar to those proposed and has years of experience in carrying themout, the NRC concludes that the requirements can be successfully imposedthrough a general license for storage of spent fuel in NRC-approved caskswithout the need for advanced NRC review and approval of a physical securityplan or other site-specific documents before the reactor licensee implementsthe requirements. Material control and accounting (MCandamp;A) requirements are designed toprotect against the undetected loss of the special nuclear material inspent fuel by maintaining vigilance over the material, tracking its movementand location, monitoring its inventory status, maintaining records of transactionsand movements, and issuing reports of its status at the time of physicalinventory. Similar requirements for MCandamp;A have been applied to powerreactors, to spent fuel storage at independent spent fuel storage installations,and to operations at certain other classes of fuel cycle facilities withoutrequiring the licensee to submit a plan to document how compliance willbe achieved. In these situations the requirements have been found to besufficient. For these reasons, it is concluded that the MCandamp;A requirementsfor the dry storage of spent fuel at power reactors can be handled undera general license. A minor editorial change to andSection; 72.30(b) is also proposed to makeclear that a decommissioning funding plan is an integral part of an applicant'sproposed decommissioning plan.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability </ITAG>The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment and thereforean environmental impact statement is not required. The rule is mainly administrativein nature and would not change safety requirements, which could have significantenvironmental impacts. The proposed rule would provide for power reactorlicensees to store spent fuel in casks approved by NRC at reactor siteswithout additional site-specific approvals by the Commission. It wouldset forth conditions of a general license for the spent fuel storage andprocedures and criteria for obtaining storage cask approval. The environmentalassessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determinationis based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room,2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, Lower Level.

This rulemaking has been submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget for review and approval of the information collectionrequirements. The reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated toaverage 2,336 hours, which will be primarily for development and submittalof a safety analysis report (SAR) by spent fuel storage cask vendors. Reviewand approval of an SAR is necessary in order to obtain a Certificate ofCompliance for a cask design from NRC. A Certificate of Compliance is requiredfor each cask design before these casks can be used for spent fuel storageunder the general license in this rule. Responses required from power reactorlicensees under this rule would be initial notification for use of thegeneral license and submittal of a notice when each cask is stored. Thus,no significant reporting burden is anticipated for these licensees.
