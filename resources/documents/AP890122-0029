Farmers in the northern Po Valley said last week that rice, wheatand barley harvests would fail if rain did not fall this month.   Ski resorts in the Piedmont region in the northwest Italian Alpsannounced earlier this month they are seeking governmentreimbursement for $115 million in lost tourist revenue.   Pope John Paul II ended his noon prayers to a crowd in St.Peter's Square by adding: ``Let's greet this rain with gratitude.''   Meteorologists predicted skies would clear Monday.   Rain began Saturday night on the southern end of Sardinia. Therest of the island off central Italy barely got wet, and Sundaydawned sunny.   RAI state television reported that congregations prayed for rainin services Sunday around the island.   Sardinian reservoirs had a two-month supply of drinking waterleft. Cloud seeding to induce rain has been under consideration andseveral cities have limited water use.   The island wants Rome to declare it a natural disaster area andis seeking $692 million worth of aid.   Sheep have nibbled bare most of their grazing areas. Agriculturalofficials say the artichoke harvest was hurt by the drought and thattomato and beet crops could be too. Farmers say the drought rivalsthe disastrous dry spell on the island in 1812.   Snow fell in the Valle d'Aosta area for about four hours Sundaymorning, said Giulia Ianacone, of the Alpine ski area's informationoffice. ``The snow was not heavy and there was littleaccumulation,'' she said, speaking by telephone.   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that a few lifts on thevalley's slopes were reopened but they appeared likely to closeagain because the snowfall was melting rapidly under a strong noonsun.   State television reported two inches of snow fell Sunday onCourmayeur, a popular resort near the French and Swiss borders.Eastern Alpine areas reported no snow.   Before Sunday, the last snowfall in the Italian Alps occurred inearly December, when an average of eight inches fell. The snowlessholidays forced some resort owners to reimburse angry skiers who hadpaid in advance for vacations.   Mild temperatures made the use of artificial snow-makersimpractical, and some international cross-country races scheduledfor mid-January were canceled.</TEXT></DOC>
