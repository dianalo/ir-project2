At thefirst stage, data preparation, their organizing according to regime andgeometric parameters, data retrieval, in which determining parameterschange in small ranges, are carried out. At the second stage, the distributionof critical heat flux values is investigated to correspond to the normallaw. When rejection of anomalous values is carried out, the characteristicsof the empirical distribution are recalculated according to the reducedsample data. The system is realized as automated program complex forthe ES computer OS using the PL1 language. The system can be used forthe preliminary analysis of experimental data files in any subject direction.8 refs.; 2 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
