The Britishand Norwegian systems of industrial relations, viewed as typical casesof pluralism and neo-corporatism, are contrasted in terms of social rationality.The capacity for local restructuring when national traditions fail offshoreis different in the two systems: British unions are flexible as longas basic economic incentives and the right to organize locally are notchallenged. Legal-bureaucratic control presupposes state autonomy basedon independent resources and expertise. When the Norwegian union traditionfailed offshore, the political culture and network resources proved tobe a powerful basis for local action. Problems in safety and health regulationrevealed the implicit cooperation which is normally the basis for neo-corporatistcontrol relations. However, the success of independent militant unionswas regarded as a threat to existing unions and national economic policy-makingsystem. The institutional structures of pluralist and neo-corporatistsystems have implications which are often overlooked under normal conditions.Moreover, they go beyond and may even be incompatible with, ideologicalinterpretations.</TEXT></DOC>
