RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court said today it will try toclarify the issue of when a federal civil rights law may be used tosue states and their agencies.   The court agreed to consider a lawsuit that accuses Michiganofficials of denying a promotion to a state employee because hisbrother was a political activist.   The justices will review a ruling that threw out a suit againstthe state police and its director.   Ray Will sought promotion to a job as data systems analyst withthe state police in 1973. He had been ranked second on a promotionlist, and moved up to number one when the applicant above himwithdrew from consideration.   But Will said he learned years later that he didn't get the jobbecause a so-called Red Squad operated by the state police hadinvestigated his brother, Charles, a student political activist.   The Red Squad, which monitored campus radicals with subversiveideas, was held unconstitutional by a state judge in 1976.   Will then sued his employers in state court under a federalcivil rights law enacted after the Civil War. The suit named thestate police and its director as defendants.   A state judge in 1982 ruled that Will's rights were violated andawarded him more than $153,000 for lost wages, emotional distressand punitive damages.   But the Michigan Supreme Court overruled the judge last August.   The state's highest court said the civil rights law invoked byWill authorizes suits against ``persons,'' and that neither thestate, the state police nor the police director may becharacterized as a person for purposes of seeking back pay andmonetary damages.   Neither a state nor ``a state official sued in an officialcapacity for retroactive relief'' is a person under the law, thestate court said.   The state court cited a number of U.S. Supreme Court rulingsdealing with the issue of state immunity from lawsuits. The statecourt said the rulings are somewhat ambiguous but on the wholesupport its decision barring Will's suit.   In the appeal acted on today, Will said other state and federalcourts have held that states and state officials may be considered``persons'' who are subject to being sued under federal civilrights law.   The case is Will vs. Michigan Department of State Police,87-1207.</TEXT></DOC>
