International Management Group, which bills itself as the world's largest sports-promotion and management firm, signed agreements in Moscow last week forming joint-venture companies with the Soviet government.    The agreements cover just about everything in the sports field, according to Cleveland-based IMG, the company founded by famed sports agent Mark McCormack. The Soviets want IMG to develop golf courses, tennis centers and resort complexes. They want the firm to represent Soviet athletes and teams in gaining international endorsements, to manage international sporting events and to act as the go-between for deals with Western sports-equipment makers. They have even asked the firm to help them sell their thoroughbred horses internationally.    IMG isn't counting its rubles yet. &quot;They want so many things, it's a question of how they deliver,&quot; says Gerry Buckley, the London-based deputy chairman and chief executive of IMG Development Ltd., the IMG subsidiary that signed the deal.    Still, the agreement is but one of several indications that the Soviets are serious about capitalizing on their sports prowess. Among others: They are partners with cable television's Ted Turner in staging the Olympics-like Goodwill Games, and are marketing their budding tennis stars internationally through IMG's arch rival, Washington D.C.-based ProServ Inc.    IMG will begin by bringing in teams of architects to study the development of, among other things, two world-class golf courses. The Soviets also have asked IMG to develop resorts where foreign businessmen can frolic. &quot;There's a tremendous number of foreign businessmen showing up at the door these days trying to do deals,&quot; Mr. Buckley says. &quot;The Soviets are trying to get them to stay here as long as they can.&quot;    The representation of athletes could be significant. Mr. Buckley says several Soviet athletic teams could be included in the deal, including the world champion hockey team. How about tennis? Mr. Buckley would only say it's a &quot;gray area.&quot; But he notes that ProServ's contract was up for renegotiation next month. ProServ officials couldn't be reached for comment.    As owners of 51% of the ventures, the Soviets have promised to provide labor, building materials, land, utilities, machinery -- and the money to pay for them. Anything purchased outside the Soviet Union will be paid for by IMG. &quot;I wouldn't want them to provide some things,&quot; Mr. Buckley explains, &quot;like sophisticated air conditioning equipment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
