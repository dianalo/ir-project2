<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0105 </DOCNO><TEXT>A copiously illustrated report is presented on solar systems. It startsby informing on the set-up and mode of action of such systems with theircollectors (absorbers, heat-loss, vacuum-tube collectors, radiation balance,heat transfer). Further subjects are the thermal performance of collectors(efficiency, characteristic curve, collector equation, characteristicquantities, examples), systems to heat swimming-pools, and experiencegathered with solar systems used for heat generation in hotels and forwater heating. This is followed by advice on the dimensioning, execution,and operation of solar systems used to heat swimming-pools and to providehot water. It relates, inter alia, to collector circuiting, heat exchangers,storage units, fittings, corrosion, material choice, mode of operation,and economic efficiency. Finally legal and normative aspects are discussed(purchasing recommendations, promotion measures). (HWJ)</TEXT></DOC>
