LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. said it will sue the Federal Aviation Administration for canceling the unit's $79 million contract for microwave-landing systems.    A spokesman for the subsidiary, Hazeltine Corp., called the agency's action &quot;unsupportable&quot; and said the company hopes to have it overturned in federal claims court. It will also seek damages.    Hazeltine made the statement in response to an FAA letter, released yesterday, that said Hazeltine &quot;has failed to perform and deliver in accordance with the schedule&quot; of the contract. Engineering and production obstacles have delayed the delivery date three years, the FAA said.    Hazeltine alleges that problems were caused by both &quot;massive&quot; changes imposed by the FAA over several years and the agency's &quot;maladministration&quot; of the contract. An FAA spokesman last night said the agency had no comment on any possible legal action at this time.    Hazeltine said the dispute centers strictly on issues involving payments, timing of deliveries and the FAA's performance of its contractual obligations. The company stressed that performance of its systems isn't an issue.    &quot;The FAA has stated publicly that there are no microwave-landing-system performance issues in dispute and that Hazeltine's units have functioned as the company promised,&quot; a spokesman said.    The spokesman added that Emerson management believes that the outcome of the dispute matter won't have a &quot;material adverse effect&quot; on the company's operations. Last year, Hazeltine had revenue of approximately $158 million, representing about 2.4% of Emerson's total 1988 revenue of $6.7 billion.    An FAA spokesman last night said the agency had no comment on any possible legal action at this time.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Emerson Electric closed at $37, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
