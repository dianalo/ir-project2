Parliament burst into applause when Parliament's president,Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, announced the ``truly historic event.''   After an 11-hour Parliament session that lasted until Thursday'spredawn hours, lawmakers voted 294 to 62 to make Oct. 3 the day thenation becomes part of a single Germany. Seven lawmakers abstained.   The date was a compromise between the major factions inParliament after weeks of battling that tore apart the broadcoalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.   Earlier, lawmakers rejected a proposal by the small GermanSocial Union party to unify immediately.   Parliament also passed a treaty that will allow all-Germanelections on Dec. 2. The West German Parliament is to vote on thesame treaty Thursday. Easy passage is expected.   East Germany in effect has approved a clause, effective Oct. 3,in the West Germany constitution that allows former German lands toaccede to the Western nation.   It is a major psychological boost to a nation troubled byeconomic and political chaos.   De Maiziere urged lawmakers to accept Oct. 3 as the historic dayof German unity and end the seemingly pointless squabbling overwhether unity should take place in August, September or October.   ``Many people have gotten the impression discussions over a dateare more important to us than the solution of crucial problems,''he told Parliament.   ``A binding commitment and an end to the discussion are longoverdue,'' he said.   The weeks-long dispute was the result of a power strugglebetween the Christian Democrats of de Maiziere and West GermanChacellor Helmut Kohl and the left-leaning Social Democrats in bothnations.   The two parties are jockeying for the best political advantageheading into Dec. 2 elections for a united German government.   Many lawmakers acknowledged the convoluted wrangling in recentdays seemed to have lost relevance as average East Germans strugglewith rising joblessness and higher prices.   ``I ask you, who even understands our desires?'' asked GregorGysi, head of the reformed Communists, the third-largest party inParliament.   The lawmakers met in special session to try to resolvedifferences over the date of unity.   The Social Democrats insisted it occur Sept. 15. As EastGermany's second-largest party, their approval is needed to pass aunification proposal.   De Maiziere's Christian Democrats on Wednesday as a compromiseproposed Oct. 3 as the merger date.   Kohl's conservative government said earlier in the day thatunity could occur on East Germany's Oct. 7 birthday or one dayearlier.   Kohl has been able to orchestrate most of the unity process.   He and de Maiziere, his East German ally, previously backedmerging the two countries on Oct. 14, but the Social Democratsbalked.   The Social Democrats want unity quickly so West Germany can morequickly assume direct responsibility for East Germany's failingeconomy.   Joblessness has been climbing since East Germany converted to afree market on July 1.   The Social Democrats also want early unification so that Kohlwill be forced to admit the staggering costs of bailing out EastGermany and its 16 million residents. This could cost the ChristianDemocrats at the polls in December.   West Germany says it is crucial that unity not occur before theOct. 1-2 meeting in New York City of foreign ministers from the35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.   The meeting will cap a series of negotiations between the fourWorld War II Allies _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britainand France _ and the two Germanys on the global aspects of Germanunity.   West Germany has proposed that the results of talks oninternational aspects of German unity be presented at the thismeeting.   In those negotiations, the Soviet Union dropped its oppositionto NATO membership for a united Germany in exchange for a promiseits troops in what is now East Germany can remain there for up tofour years. Also reached was an agreement that a united Germanywould not try to claim lands forfeited to Poland after NaziGermany's defeat in 1945.   Unemployment has been climbing since East Germany converted to afree market on July 1. Factories have been unable to compete withan invasion of Western products.   The debate over the pace of unification and the problems withthe economy has led to the resignations or dismissals of sixministers in de Maiziere's Cabinet the past week and the decisionby the Social Democrats to leave his coalition.   In the end, the compromise was agreed to by the Social Democratsand another party that earlier had left de Maiziere's coalition inthe dispute, the Liberal faction.</TEXT></DOC>
