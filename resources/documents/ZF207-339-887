With egg?andP;  Withtomato paste?andP;  There may be no specific rules, but a model of the domain willsuggest the answers.andM;Tools to build models are likely to be the next big field for AI.andP;  Instead ofnew programming techniques applied to old applications, they will let usbuild new applications that are based on human knowledge rather than tangibledata.andP;  Engineers are already using such systems to design mechanical,electronic, and software systems; the change will be to apply the sametechniques (whether they are called AI or not) to more complex, commercialsituations such as pricing, customers behavior, and corporate structures.andM;The tools I'm talking about will enable you to visualize projects, toorganize ideas by connecting boxes and automating cross-references, to modelcause and effect with boxes and arrows.andP;  Such tools are what originally lureda lot of heavy thinkers to AI.andP;  Most have given up on dreams of replicatinghuman thinking and are now more interested in enabling and extending it.andM;The market for these tools is just beginning to open up.andP;  They are startingto show up on &quot;standard&quot; computers--PCs rather than Symbolics LISP machines.andO;And new kinds of people are starting to use computers--not just engineers,clerks, and analysts, but thinkers, managers, strategists.andP;  The concepts theywork with may be too complex for a computer to understand, but a computer canhold and organize the data they need to think with.andM;And finally, there's Steve Job's NeXT machine--a system specifically built toaccommodate the modeling approach to system-building.andP;  The NeXT computer'sdevelopment environment, NextStep, contains a set of system building blocks(or objects), and an object-oriented language called Objective-C.andO;Objective-C will allow developers to create their own building blocks, whichthe rest of us will be able to use to construct our models and make them run.andM;In the pure AI arena, IntelliCorp, a &quot;traditional&quot; AI vendor that has laggedin the embedded-AI market, may have something after all (if it can lower itsprices fast enough) in its KEE tool, a rich environment for building models.andO;(Existing applications include SimKit, for models of process control systems,and IntelliScope, for modeling data structures.)andM;IntelliCorp and many other vendors in the field owe a large debt to Xerox'sPalo Alto Research Center (PARC), which pioneered the idea of buildingcomputers for persons--as opposed to computers cheap enough for a singleperson to afford.andP;  (Note, however, that &quot;pure AI,&quot; in the form of LISP andProlog, comes not from the humanist traditions of PARC and its ilk, butmostly from university-based computer scientists.andP;  Overall, the new paradigmis reusable, manipulatable objects rather than rules.)andM;The &quot;new AI&quot; vendors include ParcPlace Systems with Smalltalk (originallyfrom Xerox PARC), Metaphor Computer Systems (with founders from Xerox PARCand a 10 percent equity investment from IBM), Lotus with Agenda (codevelopedby a founder of Teknowledge), and a variety of vendors of graphical,object-oriented tools that build on work done at Xerox PARC.andM;So is AI successful?andP;  The goal is to shift the traditional trade-offcurve--power versus flexibility--so that you can have both.andP;  Rule-based,embedded AI has certainly made many production applications and advisorytools more flexible.andP;  But nothing can match the creativity of the human mindwhen it is empowered by a flexible, powerful, model-building tool.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
