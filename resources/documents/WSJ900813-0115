Toyoichi Tanaka, professor of physics, is working withJell-O-like polymers that can be made to shrink and swellunder various conditions. Earlier this year, Mr. Tanaka andhis colleagues described a polymer gel that swelled up whenit was struck by ultraviolet light and then collapsed when itwas plunged into the dark. The reaction, however, was tooslow to be useful.   Now, the physicist and Atsushi Suzuki, a visitingcolleague from Yokohama National University in Japan, reporta new polymer gel that rapidly responds to visible light. Thesecret was incorporating chlorophyll, the molecule thatplants use to convert sunlight to chemical energy.   The new gel collapses to less than half its originalvolume in a few thousandths of a second wherever a beam ofvisible light strikes it. When the light is turned off, theshrunken portion of the gel almost instantly expands to itsoriginal volume, according the two scientists' report in arecent issue of the journal Nature. In tiny cylinders of thegel, each about the diameter of a muscle fiber, the degree ofshrinkage could be controlled by varying the intensity of thelight beam, the scientists report.   Gels that change size in response to an electric currenthave been proposed for making artificial sphincter musclesfor the bladders of paralyzed and incontinent people. But Mr.Tanaka suggests that gels that respond to light beams,delivered perhaps by optical fibers, might be safer forimplanting in the body.   Other possible uses include light-controlled switches anda solar engine in which cylinders of the gel shrink andexpand as they rotate in and out of the sunlight. Mr. Tanakais patenting the new gels and hints that he already has apossible licensee lined up.   Father Gets Back Marrow   That He Donated to Son                                                                                                          CANCER specialists in London report a medical variation ofthe Golden Rule.   Back in 1980, doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital inSurrey, England, cured a 12-year-old boy of leukemia bydestroying his cancer-ridden bone marrow with radiation. Thenthey gave the boy a transplant of bone marrow donated by hisfather. Because the father's marrow didn't exactly match theson's, the boy suffered repeated medical problems in themonths afterward. Finally, the father's donated marrow&quot;took,&quot; the boy recovered, returned to school and graduated,the British doctors report in the Lancet.   In late 1987, the 45-year-old father came down withanother type of leukemia that, by a rare coincidence, alsowas treatable by radiation and bone marrow transplant. Testsof the son showed that contrary to scientists' predictions,the boy's native marrow hadn't revived. Instead, the father'stransplanted marrow continued to thrive. In April 1988, thedoctors took some of the father's marrow from the son andretransplanted it to the father. A year later, the father wasfree of all signs of leukemia.                                                                                                          `Smart Glass' Could Trim   Bulk of Camera Lenses                                                                                                          SCIENTISTS at a small limited partnership in Arizona claimthey've developed &quot;smart glass&quot; for new kinds of eyeglasses,camera lenses and other optical devices.   Isotec in Tucson says it has discovered a way to make asingle glass lens that will bend light by several differentangles, a &quot;gradient refractive index&quot; (GRIN) lens. Most glasslenses refract light by only a single angle determined by thecurvature of the lens.   Currently, to bend light by different angles requireslining up several lenses. A standard wide-angle camera lens,for example, might require six successive lenses to takelight from angles ranging from the far left to the far rightand to focus it on film.   In one of Isotec's configurations, the center sections ofthe lens bend light at different angles from the outersections. This makes possible a wide-angle camera lensconsisting of only one or two GRIN lenses, says LeslieDanziger, Isotec's chief executive officer. For the samereason, GRIN binoculars could be more compact than ordinaryones.   In communications, a GRIN lens could be used to merge or&quot;multiplex&quot; several message-carrying light beams into asingle beam for long-distance transmission via a singleoptical fiber. The beam could then be &quot;demultiplexed&quot; by aGRIN lens at the receiving end, a trick that until now hasbeen used only in electronic communications.   Isotec says the university and company scientists it hasfunded can fuse glasses with different refractive indexes --light-bending properties -- into a single lens of almost anydesired size. Isotec wants to license the technology to othercompanies, Ms. Danziger says.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          BIOMECHANICS experts at the University of Cincinnaticonfirm that waiters who hold a tray of food high in the airare using the least stressful position for carrying the tray.. . .
