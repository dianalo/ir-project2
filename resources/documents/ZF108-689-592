Do I really want it?andP;  Will Appledrop some features in order to get the product out this year? Are third-partydevelopers holding up features of new products until System 7 is out? Andwhen I get it, will I begin waiting impatiently for System 8?andM;From down in the dugout, I'll try to answer them all, in order.andM;When will I get it?andM;May 7, 1990.andP;  But you probably meant, when will you get it? The best guess isJanuary 1991.andP;  As Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference approached,developers and Apple watchers were speculating that System 7 wouldn't see thelight of day this year and were pushing Apple to announce a firm deliverydate.andM;Apple has now promised third-party developers working on System 7-supportingproducts that most Mac users will have had a chance to upgrade to System 7 bythe first of the year.andP;  I think John Sculley will hold Apple to this promise.andO;There's an operating-system war on, with many people claiming that therecently released Microsoft Windows 3.0 is better than the Mac's currentsystem software.andP;  Sculley mentioned Windows 3.0 three times in his keynoteaddress at this year's Developers Conference, and you get the impression thathe feels that every day without System 7 is a day of lost market share.andM;Microsoft, which is good with names, has arranged it so that anybody whowants to be considered  knowledgeable about operating systems calls Windows3.0 Win Three.andM;Do I really want it?andM;Yes.andP;  Apple will make you want it.andP;  But you really should want System 7,because it will be a marked improvement over current System software.andP;  Theconsensus of those who have used it, even with all its alpha-version bugs,slugs, and gooey ughs (by which I mean that it is buggy and sluggish and thatthere are a few blemishes on the graphical user interface [GUI], all normalfor alpha software), is that they can't go back to System 6.andP;  The new Finder,in particular, pulls off the neat trick of making the user interface moreconsistent and unified while at the same time putting more control of theSystem into users' hands.andM;Eventually you'll have to use System 7, since it will be the only game beingdealt by the only dealer in town.andP;  (That's what Apple thinks anyway.andP;  I'vealtered the expression &quot;only game in town&quot; to hint at where Apple and I couldturn out to be wrong.andP;  Other hints appear toward the end of this piece.)andM;Between now and eventually, Apple is encouraging third-party developers tocreate &quot;smart binaries&quot;: single versions of their products that discern whichSystem the machine is running and perform appropriately under either System 6or System 7 so that, theoretically, even networks of System 7 and System 6machines with smart binaries on a server should work.andP;  Eventually is probablyabout two years f rom now.andM;That business of smart  binaries is important, since for many users,upgrading to System  7 is not free.andP;  First, System 7 requires a minimum of 2megabytes  of memory and a hard disk, so any machine not meeting these minimum requirements will have to be upgraded to run System 7.andP;  Second, manyusers will want to take advantage of the virtual-memory feature of System 7,which requires a 68030 machine or a PMMU (a memory-management chip).andP;  Andthird, it's better than a good guess that even machines with 2 megabytes ofmemory will need to add memory to avoid losing performance.andM;Will Apple drop some features in order to get the product out this year?andM;Yes, and every certified developer knows exactly which features, of thoseannounced at last year's Developers Conference as part of System 7, will notbe part of the first release.andM;At this year's Developers Conference, Apple handed out CDs containing alphaversions of System 7 and promised developers that all features in the productas it existed on the CD would be in the final release version.andP;  This, ofcourse, begged the question of what features were on the CD and what featureswere not.andP;  Among the components that Apple has committed to are TrueTypefonts, virtual memory, Finder 7.0, the new data-access methodology, andinterapplication communication.andP;  Among the nots was user scripting, whichwe'll see somewhat later.andM;Are third-party developers holding up features of new products until System 7is out?andM;A lot of people think so.andP;  At Macworld Expo in San Francisco last spring,there was a pervading sense of innovation on hold.andP;  One reporter saidMacworld &quot;lacked innovation&quot;; another could not find a single significantproduct.&quot; If this is so, Macworld Boston this summer will be even duller thanSan Francisco.andM;But ACIUS is not waiting, and its Macworld Expo introductions give a hint ofwhat to expect from what Apple so endearingly calls &quot;System 7-studly apps.&quot;andO;In fact, Apple used ACIUS' new applications in demonstrations ofinterapplication communication at the Developers Conference and also usedunreleased Claris software that employed Dave Winer's implementation ofinterapplication communication, which developers were told is compatible withSystem 7.andP;  Apple itself did not wait for System 7 to introduce the alreadylong-awaited new version of HyperCard.andP;  HyperCard 2.0 does not support System7, although the plan is to release what sounds to me like a System 7-wimpyVersion 2.1 along with System 7.andP;  Perhaps I expect too much.andP;  Oh, andAshton-Tate didn't wait to provide interapplication communication between itsFullWrite and dbMac products.andM;Reading between the lines in one of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' publicstatements, it appears that microsoft is delaying new features in itsMacintosh products for System 7.andP;  Right, that's the same Microsoft that sellsWin Three.andM;When I got it, will I begin waiting impatiently fop System 8?andM;Yes, but if you're a software developer you may do more than wait.andP;  Somefeatures that are important to some people won't be in System 7: Truemultitasking.andP;  Memory protection.andP;  Support for realtime processing.andP;  Userscripting won't be a part of the initial release.andP;  System 7 is a major stepforward, make no mistake, but it won't supply everything everyone might wantin an operating system, and some developers are likely to treat theshortcomings as development opportunities.andM;Apple claims that the PC world has a confusion of DOS, Windows, and OS/2while the Mac world will have only System 7.andP;  If third-party softwaredevelopers respond to System 7's omissions by creating their ownoperating-system utilities, shells, or even alternatives, it may not be thatsimple.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
