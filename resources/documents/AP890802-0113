Patients ranging from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs wereadmitted for treatment, most of them at hospitals in Durban andJohannesburg. Hospital officials, trying to avoid confrontations,did not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of medicalcare.   ``We see the campaign today as a major victory,'' said MurphyMorobe, a leader of the Mass Democratic Movement, a looselyorganzied coalition of anti-apartheid groups that arranged theprotests.   ``We proved that we did not intend to cause violence or disruptmedical services, but to help the government remove the albatrossof apartheid,'' he said at a news conference.   Morobe said the campaign will include other major protestsbefore next month's segregated parliamentary elections, but refusedto say what form they would take or when they would begin.   The government claims the campaign is part of an effort toviolently disrupt the Sept. 6 elections for the tricameralparliament which has separate chambers for whites, Asians andpeople of mixed race, but excludes the 28 million black majority.   The Mass Democratic Movement has accused authorities of a``hysterical response'' and has pledged that its actions will benon-violent.   The last sustained defiance campaigns were conducted in the1950s and ended in March 1960 when police shot and killed 69 blacksparticipating in a peaceful protest against the now-abolished passlaws that restricted blacks' freedom of movement.   Anti-apartheid groups have organized several one- and two-daynationwide general strikes in recent years, and a widespread hungerstrike earlier this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in therelease of virtually all of them.   Organizers said the new campaign would last indefinitely.   ``The defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and everysection of society until apartheid is unworkable,'' said JayNaidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African TradeUnions, the nation's largest labor federation.   Twelve white women supporting Wednesday's protest were arrestedbriefly in Johannesburg, but no violence was reported at any of theeight targeted hospitals.   In Durban, more than 1,000 protesters staged an illegaldemonstration near Addington Hospital, while about 140 blacks andIndians, under the direction of senior anti-apartheid leaders, wereadmitted for out-patient treatment. ``Apartheid Makes Us Sick,''said one poster carried at the rally.   The first protester to enter Addington was Mariam Jagga, anelderly Indian woman in a wheelchair.   At Johannesburg General Hospital, about 50 blacks were admittedfor treatment, and hundreds of supporters staged a rally at anadjoining medical school.   Like Addington, Johannesburg General regularly admits someblacks for emergency care and specialized treatment, but has apolicy of transferring them to less well-equipped black hospitalsas soon as feasible.   Dr. Reg Broekmann, superintendent of Johannesburg General, saidabout 11 percent of his 830 patients were black.   Johannesburg General's occupancy is about 50 percent, while theonly full-service hospital in the Soweto township outsideJohannesburg is so overcrowded that hundreds of patients sleep onthe floors.   ``As of today, the Mass Democratic Movement considers all healthfacilities in South Africa open (to all races),'' said Aslam Dasoo,a doctor who helped organize the protest.   The protests were smaller at the six targeted hospitals outsideJohannesburg and Durban. Activists said some would-be protesterswere stopped at police roadblocks.   In related developments:   _ Seventeen activists in Cape Town announced that on Sunday theywill begin defying restrictions imposed on them following theirrecent release from detention. Like many ex-detainees, they arerequired to remain in their homes at night and to report daily topolice.   _ The National Union of Mineworkers said its members areattempting to use facilities reserved for whites, includingbathrooms, cafeterias and buses.   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites control the country'spolitical system and the economy and maintain segregatedneighborhoods and schools.</TEXT></DOC>
