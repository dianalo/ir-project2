Acid rain has destroyed foliage and damaged ancient statues andstone tablets in the city of Hangzhou, the official China NewsService said in a report seen in Beijing today. Hangzhou is incoastal Zhejiang province.   In Nanking, capital of the Nationalist government until theCommunist takeover in 1949, acid rain is also causing seriousproblems, the report said. Nanking is in Jiangsu province.   In May 1986, leaves of 400 snow pines planted in Hangzhou'sparks and hotel grounds turned yellow and withered as a result ofacid rain.   Around Hangzhou's famous West Lake, stone statues and stonetablets bearing inscriptions by historical figures are being erodedby the rains, as are stone Buddha images at the Monastery of theSpirit's Retreat, the city's best-known monastery.   Experts say the problem is caused by pollution from industries,which burn low-quality coal that has a high sulphur content, and bythe city's thousands of boilers and tens of thousands of familycoal stoves that release sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, thereport said.   Earlier news reports said acid rain is a major problem inSichuan province in southwestern China and neighboring Guizhouprovince, in the southern provinces of Hunan and Guangxi, and inShanghai.   The problem is most serious in the south, where the soil isbasically acidic. In the north, the alkaline soil neutralizes theacid in the rain, experts said.   China started its research into acid rain in 1981 and lastSeptember passed the country's first air pollution prevention law.</TEXT></DOC>
