BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   AMR Corp. announced another airplane purchaseMonday, a deal for six Airbus Industries jets and options for sixmore, giving the parent of American Airlines firm orders for 248jets with options for 302 more as it continues to expand what isalready the largest fleet in the non-Communist world.   Neither company would reveal the cost of the deal, but previousestimates have placed it above $850 million.   The deal means that in the last 31 months, the Fort Worth-basedcompany has placed firm orders and options for more than $22billion worth of planes for American, which last year became thenation's largest carrier. In addition, its AMR Eagle commuterairline has placed orders and options for another 250 jets valuedat about $1.45 billion.   Meanwhile, AMR continued to be one of the most actively tradedissues on the New York Stock Exchange Monday as 1.6 million shareschanged hands and the price declined $1.12{ a share to close at$85. The activity has been attributed to speculation involving apossible takeover of the airline.   AMR said it would use the six widebody A300-600Rs ordered Mondayto expand its Caribbean service, and return to domestic servicesome of the DC-10s now flying those routes.   Five of the jets, valued at about $71 million each, will bedelivered in 1991, with one the following year. AMR also hasoptions for six more of the jets to be delivered in 1992 and 1993.The jets are powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2 engines.   The planes, which meet the strictest noise requirements, aredesigned to carry about 267 passengers, said David Venz, spokesmanfor the French manufacturer.   ``The point is that we are a growing and expanding airlinecompany with a great need for airplanes,'' AMR spokesman Al Beckersaid. ``We are always looking for aircraft.   Most of the planes purchased during the buying binge have beenintended for expansion and not replacement of older aircraft,Becker said.   American's fleet already numbers 485, and Becker said thecarrier plans to have 575 planes by 1994. That does not count theoptions the airline holds for an additional 302 jets.   ``Admittedly it's blue sky,'' Becker said, but American is inposition to have a 900-plane fleet by the end of the next decade.   With Monday's order, American now has firm orders for 85 MD-80sand eight MD-11s from McDonnell Douglas Corp.; 70 757-200s and 10767-399ERs from Boeing Co.; and 75 Fokker 100s from the Dutchmanufacture.   The airline also has options on 100 MD-80 and 42 MD-11s, 85options split between the two Boeing aircraft and 75 options on theFokker 100s.</TEXT></DOC>
