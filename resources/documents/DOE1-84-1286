At the Shell Canada bitumen production plantnear Peace River, Alberta, the use of traditional process cooling systems,such as air coolers, were replaced by the use of cold steam generatorfeed water and a glycol heat medium system. The success of the pilotplant led to an expansion to commercial size in 1986. Production capacityis now 1600 m/sup 3//day of bitumen. Currently the process design isbeing prepared for a second plant which could produce an additional 6400m/sup 3/day of bitumen. The subject of this paper is the effort madeby Shell Canada to minimize the energy costs by closely integrating theexisting plants' heating and cooling loads. Included in the discussionare: plant energy analysis, energy integration objectives, provisionsmade for plant operation, operating experience with the system, and suggestionsfor similar plant designs.</TEXT></DOC>
