ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Overall sales again were sluggish in October for the nation'slargest general retailers, but apparel lines continued the recoverythey began in September.   ``Sales for the month were good _ obviously it was led byapparel,'' said Monroe H. Greenstein, a retail industry analyst withthe investment firm Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Inc.   However, Greenstein said Thursday, October's results lookedbetter than they really were because they were being comparedagainst the very weak sales of October 1987.   Jeffrey Feiner, a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. analyst, said, ``We stillcharacterize the overall retail environment as somewhat sluggish anddon't expect any significant improvement going into this importantChristmas selling season.''   But Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., saw cause for optimism.   ``I don't see any reason to compare (the sales) with last year,''because most of the weakness in October 1987 came in the weekfollowing the stock market crash, he said.   ``I think Christmas will be quite substantial,'' Loeb said.   Analysts and retailers reported improvement in apparel sales,which have been in a slump since August of last year because ofcustomer reluctance to buy shorter skirts and clothes they felt wereboring. Clothing sales had shown some signs of life in September,boosting hopes that a recovery finally was under way.   Limited Inc., a leading specialty apparel retailer, reported itsoverall October sales rose 20 percent while sales at stores open atleast a year _ known as same-store sales _ rose 15 percent.   ``We're starting to see some pickup at the rest'' of the apparelretailers, said Fred Wintzer, an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; SonsInc. in Baltimore.   Beyond fashion troubles, retailers in general have sufferedthrough sluggish sales for more than a year and a half as consumerspaid more for necessities and services and tried to pay down theirhigh debt levels.   Several retailers again reported sales gains well under the rateof inflation, which has increased by 4.5 percent so far this year.   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., whichearlier this week announced a restructuring and overhaul of itsselling strategy, said its overall sales were up 7.5 percent lastmonth and 5.9 percent for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year.Sears' same-store sales rose 2.5 percent in October and 2 percentfor the year so far.   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are amore accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures thatinclude sales from new stores. But not all retailers report bothoverall and same-store results.   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 5.8 percent in Octoberand 5.7 percent for the first 39 weeks of the year. The company'ssame-store sales rose 1.8 for the month and 2 percent for the yearto date.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported its overall sales were up 24percent last month and 29 percent so far this year. Its same-storesales were up 9 percent for the month and 11 percent for the year todate.   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales rose 8.1 percent lastmonth, and 0.4 percent for the year so far. Its same-store saleswere up 6.9 percent in October, but fell 0.7 percent over the 39weeks.   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales rose 8.8 percent lastmonth, and 16 percent for the 39-week period. Same-store sales wereup 1 percent in October and 1.7 percent for the year to date.   May Department Stores Co. reported a 22.8 percent jump in overallsales in October and a 15.4 percent rise so far this year. May'ssame-store sales were up 3.7 percent last month and 1.8 percent forthe year to date.   Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. reported a 3.2 percent rise in Octobersales, and a 3.1 pickup during the 39-week period.   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its overall October sales rose 11.7percent, while year-to-date sales improved 12.1 percent. Woolworth'ssame-store sales were up 5.7 percent for the month, and 5.9 percentso far this year.   The results reported Thursday were from the biggest generalmerchandise and apparel retailers.
