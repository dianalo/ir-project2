 Drawing information from several existing FBI databases,the &quot;Drug Information System&quot; lists suspects' names and stores data on theircars, travel, phone calls, meetings, assets, and family connections.andP;  Itsmonitor can display fingerprints, mug shots and surveillence photos.andP;  Byyear-end, AI capabilities will be added to help agents detect suspiciousactions, suggest leads and forecast crimes.andP;  The system will be installed infour cities by the end of the month, and 18 cities by the end of the year.andM;BUG IN THE BUREAU...andP;  A strain of the Jerusalem-B computer virus attacked theCensus Bureau last month, apparently entering via software the agency boughtfrom an outside company.andP;  The virus was discovered on disks used to read thecomputerized version of the bureau's 1989 County and City Data Book.andO;Libraries who received the 350 infected disks were notified.andP;  Although bureauofficials expressed frustration over security flaws, they insist this bugwill not affect the 1990 national count set to get under way in April.andM;Randamp;D SPENDING DIPS...andP;  Results from an upcoming National Science Foundationsurvey indicate that U.S.andP;  spending on corporate research programs fell forthe first time since 1975.andP;  Although investment increased from $66.5 billionto $68.8 billion in 1989, adjustments for inflation show a real decrease ofjust under 1 percent.andM;DAVID AND GOLIATH...andP;  Stonehouse andamp; Company, a Dallas-based supplier oftelecommunications network software, has filed suit against IBM accusing BigBlue of engaging in unfair trade competition and deceptive advertising.andO;Amidst charges of commercial blackmail, Stonehouse President Marshall Robertsclaims &quot;IBM used its immense size and power to muscle us out of a groupbidding for a multimillion dollar contract.&quot;andP;  He is seeking an unspecifiedamount of damages and a declaration that IBM's new &quot;best solution&quot; ads arefalse and misleading.andM;SQUARE NEIGHBORS...andP;  ComputerLand, the largest U.S.andP;  computer store chain, isslated to open the first computer store in the U.S.S.R.andP;  this week.andP;  MicroAgewill follow shortly with one of five new stores they plan to establish in theSoviet Union by the end of 1990.andP;  Both new stores will be convenientlylocated near the recently heralded McDonald's on Pushkin Square.andM;OTA URGES ACTION...andP;  If Congress fails to act decisively, the opportunity tomake deliberate choices about new communication technologies will beovertaken by rapid technological advances, the hardening of stakeholderpositions and alliances, and the force of international developments, warnsthe Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in a new report.andP;  The OTA urgesCongress to define the role that communication and information play inAmerica.andP;  The report calls for a nation with market vision, wherecommunication is a commodity that can be bought and sold; economic vision,using communications as a springboard for economic growth; and social vision,considering communication as part of the social infrastructure.andM;CAPTIVE MARKET...andP;  House arrest is a growing trend in over 40 metropolitancities choked by overcrowded prisons.andP;  Today, more than 7,000 offenders areheld prisoner in their own homes by electronic monitoring devices usuallyworn around the ankle or wrist.andP;  The monitors send signals to a centralcomputer at the local law-enforcement agency if a detainee strays from a setschedule.andP;  In the last two years, the number of detention device vendors hastripled in size and its market is expected to soar.andP;  Ironically, theinspiration for this technology is said to have come from a Spiderman comicstrip.andM;TYPEFACE WIN...andP;  The first copyright registration issued by the U.S.andO;Copyright Office for a program that generates a style of type has been givento Adobe Systems, Mountain View, Calif.andP;  Although this decision is depictedas a victory for digitized type vendors, the action really protects onlythose computer programs that draw letters, not the designs of the lettersthemselves.andM;HDTV VENTURE...andP;  NBC and France's Thomson SA have announced a joint venturewith North American Philips Corp. to develop an enhanced TV system that mayeventually lead to a high-definition television system.andP;  NBC and Thomson havestarted work on a system called Advanced Compatible TV which would improvepicture clarity on sets developed by Thomson while allowing continued use ofconventional sets.andM;NEW LAWS OF GRAVITY...andP;  Princeton University scientists have produced theworld's largest computer simulation of the cosmos, and the result suggeststhat the universe might have evolved from gravity alone.andP;  The computer usedby the research team was able to follow the evolution of four millionparticles, some of which could have been galaxy size, in a simulated spacetwo billion light years across over a period of 13 billion years (theestimated age of the universe).andP;  Gravity, they found, could have been strongenough to move this matter about to form this richly textured cosmos.andM;WIRE LESS...andP;  First ATandamp;T introduces a prototype of an optical computer thatruns on pulses of light instead of electricity, and the next day IBM andMotorola announce the formation of an information service that will providethe first commercially available nationwide radio data.andP;  &quot;The 1990's will bean increasing wireless society,&quot; reasons Arthur Sundry, Motorola's presidentof communications.andP;  The service will be marketed by ARDIS, a new companyopening in early April.andM;PCs VS.andP;  LBs...andP;  An obesity expert at the University of Pennsylvania Schoolof Medicine figures the switch from typewriters to desktop computers can beresponsible for weight gains of as much as seven pounds per year per user.andO;Thomas A. Wadden, a psychologist in the university's Obesity Research Group,claims that computers eliminate a significant amount of daily exercisebecause files and business tools can be stored in one place and users nolonger need to run around the office to retrieve them.andP;  Calculating thecalories saved per employee, he finds an annual potential weight gain of fourto seven pounds.andP;  But PCs aren't the only culprits of convenience; Waddenalso blames extension phones, garage-door openers, and remote-controltelevision.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
