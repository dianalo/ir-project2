What a mess it is. Government purchasing rules are spread over 45,000 pages of regulations and 4,000 different laws. The Pentagon wars with the White House over control of defense acquisitions. Congress passes laws that encourage endless contractor protests. Federal purchasing agents are hopelessly overmatched by better-paid, better-trained industry negotiators.    David Packard, the chairman of computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. who headed a commission charged with overhauling defense management, says he's so exasperated with government buying habits that he would fire 20% of defense acquisition officials and congressional aides who oversee them. Fewer officials, he says, mean fewer meetings and fewer reviews, which &quot;slow things down and don't add an iota to the (purchasing) programs.&quot;    The federal government should be the nation's sharpest buyer. Federal agencies buy about $200 billion of equipment and services a year, far more than the biggest U.S. companies, giving the government the power -- theoretically, at least -- to extract concessions from any seller. But in the past year, huge government contracts for a $25 billion phone system, a $3.6 billion air-traffic control system and a myriad of weapons have been mired in protests and allegations that confidential bidding information was leaked and sometimes sold for profit.    &quot;The government isn't able to do business in an intelligent way,&quot; says Jacques Gansler, a former senior Pentagon acquisitions official and a Packard Commission consultant. He and other procurement critics say the government could get smarter by imitating the way big companies buy things: Contact a few qualified sellers, explain generally what's needed, evaluate bids on the basis of a company's ability as well as cost and renegotiate when necessary. &quot;Exercise management judgment,&quot; Mr. Gansler explains.    But the federal government can't manage that. Lawmakers bolster the rights of sellers, sometimes out of a sense of fairness, sometimes to aid businesses in their districts. Agencies must give preferences in awarding certain contracts to U.S. businesses, small businesses and companies owned by minorities or Vietnam veterans. Any company can bid, no matter how competent or incompetent. And any loser can protest, holding up a contract for months.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. is expert at using the system. Late last year, it successfully lobbied Congress to force the General Services Administration to pick two bidders, instead of one, for a $25 billion plan to replace the federal phone system -- nearly assuring that ATandamp;T will win part of the award. Then, it protested to the GSA's appeals board when it lost part of a $55 million phone-switch contract, alleging that a GSA employee leaked ATandamp;T bid information. ATandamp;T won that one, too, and now wants the GSA to pay it $1.8 million to cover the cost of the protest.    Federal agencies interpret congressional requirements to increase competition in weird ways. The Pentagon recently has been insisting sellers supply it with technical data for software, for example, so it can turn that information over to a competitor who can produce the same software, thereby ensuring competition. But computer companies that develop software with their own money -- not government funds -- refuse to go along. The result: fewer big commercial companies are willing to do business with the Pentagon, thereby diminishing competition.    Congress tried to resolve the procurement mess 14 years ago by creating the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, a White House agency charged with coordinating government purchasing programs. But the agency has been orphaned by the White House, which opposed its creation, and often leaves its top spot unfilled. Mr. Bedell, the office's most recent director, resigned in May and doesn't figure the White House will name a successor for the remainder of the Reagan administration.    The Defense Department has been particularly truculent in dealing with the procurement office, resisting the agency's efforts to coordinate regulations and to devise a statute that would combine 4,000 purchasing laws into one. &quot;At the time I left, Defense just wasn't responding&quot; to drafts of the purchasing law, Mr. Bedell says.    The office has had better luck with the Pentagon in devising a statute to prod agencies to buy more off-the-shelf products. But that bill, which the administration expects to announce shortly, has been watered down through negotiations with Rep. Jack Brooks, the powerful chairman of the House Government Operations Committee. Rep. Brooks, a Texas Democrat, objected to the procurement office's efforts to limit the number of companies that can bid on a project and their right of protest -- both important recommendations of critics who want to streamline purchasing.    Most recent congressional proposals to improve procurement policies, spurred by disclosures that defense consultants may have sold confidential information, try to reduce fraud, not overhaul the system. Rep. Brooks's committee approved a measure that would make contractors swear they haven't solicited inside information and procurement officials swear they haven't leaked any. Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.) pushed a provision through the Senate that would require defense consultants to register, like lobbyists, so the government can weigh possible conflicts of interest.    Procurement officials don't have much reason to push for more fundamental changes. Lawmakers helped create the current system, procurement officials owe their jobs to it, and contractors can use the system's quirks to tie up the government and competitors.    Recently, for instance, the Postal Service's plan to modernize went awry after it contracted with computer pioneer, H. Ross Perot, to improve service. Mr. Perot would have shared in any cost savings that resulted from his ideas -- a fairly common arrangement in the private sector. But lawmakers and Perot competitors accused the Postal Service of favoritism because it didn't seek other bidders, and they persuaded the GSA appeals board to throw out the contract.    In typical government fashion, the Postal Service dispute is bound to get more complex. The service is appealing the decision, although it says that even if it wins it will seek additional bidders.    ---                     Federal Purchasing   (Fiscal year 1987, most recent available, in billions of dollars)    Government-wide                   $197.3    Defense Department                 155.4    Department of Energy                13.9    NASA                                 7.8    Veterans Administration              3.2    Agriculture Department               2.2    General Services Admin.              2.1    Department of Transportation         1.6    Health and Human Services            1.5    Other                                9.6   Source: Office of Federal Procurement Policy</TEXT></DOC>
