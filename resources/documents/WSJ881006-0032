Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Danny Wall said publicly for the first time that the cost of rescuing ailing thrifts would be more than the thrift industry alone should be asked to bear.    Mr. Wall told the Senate Budget Committee that he had raised his cost estimate to between $45 billion and $50 billion from the $30.9 billion he had estimated last summer. This brought him close to the low range of estimates from private analysts, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the General Accounting Office.    Hours later, the House Banking Committee voted 28-23 to expand by $5 billion, to $15.8 billion, the Bank Board's authority to issue bonds, and to eliminate the annual limit -- currently $3.75 billion -- on its bond offerings. But the panel linked to that a host of restrictions that the board opposes. The agency's chief spokesman called the bill's restrictions unwarranted. &quot;We have to have latitude to make business decisions,&quot; he said.    Perhaps the restriction most onerous to the Bank Board would require that outside capital contributions to board-assisted mergers exceed what some consider a high threshold. The provision, written by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), would bar Bank Board financial assistance to any acquirer failing to contribute capital equal to at least 1% of tangible assets.    The capital requirement stems from widespread criticism that the Bank Board failed to attract much capital from acquirers for several Texas thrift mergers it assisted. About half of the Texas transactions to date wouldn't have complied with the capital requirement, according to Mr. Schumer.    The legislation also would direct the Bank Board to use cash from its bond offerings before using promissory notes or various guarantees to aid thrift mergers, even though the rate of interest on the bonds is about 2% higher than on the notes. The bill also would cap note issuance at $20 billion, about $7 billion more than is currently outstanding.    In his Senate testimony, Mr. Wall said the Bank Board's Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. could raise enough funds to complete its rescue of ailing thrifts by continuing extra insurance fees for the thrift industry for 30 years. He conceded that was an &quot;excessive&quot; burden for the industry to bear.    Thrift industry groups also decried the continuation of those fees. The U.S. League of Savings Institutions called them &quot;an intolerable burden.&quot; The smaller National Council of Savings Institutions said the fees would drive thrifts to leave the FSLIC insurance system, causing its collapse. Thrifts now are paying about 21 cents a year in regular and special assessments to the Bank Board to insure every $100 of deposits, nearly triple the assessment of eight cents per $100 normally paid by both thrifts and commercial banks.    Sen. Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.) suggested that it is already clear that taxpayers will have to shoulder directly some of the cost of the thrift crisis. &quot;The only question for us to resolve is when will we explicitly recognize that fact, appropriate the necessary funds and bring an end to this market crisis.&quot;    Mr. Wall disagreed, and listed some of the options he is considering recommending. These include:   --Raising insurance premiums for FSLIC and the FDIC, which insures commercial banks.    --Assessing all FSLIC-insured thrifts a one-time payment of 1% of their insured deposits. This would raise only about $8 billion.    --Having the Federal Reserve pay interest on reserves it holds for financial institutions, with the initial amounts going to FSLIC to deal with thrift insolvencies.    --Letting FSLIC borrow funds from the Federal Reserve or the Federal Home Loan Banks.    --Charging a fee on all new mortgages to raise money for FSLIC. Mr. Wall called this &quot;unpalatable&quot; because it &quot;could raise the cost of homes and discourage savings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
