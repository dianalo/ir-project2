The arrests came in connection with sales of 48 million yen ($381,000) of electronic-measuring equipment to China in 1985 and 1986 by the two trading houses, Kyokuto Shokai Co. and Shinsei Koeki Co. Police also charged, but didn't yet arrest, three more officials from the trading companies and three officials of Iwatsu Electric Co., which made the equipment. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced its investigation last month.    Japan increased scrutiny of technology exports to communist countries following disclosures of sales of militarily sensitive machine tools to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba Corp. unit in 1983 and 1984. The international outcry over those sales was deeply embarrassing to the Japanese government.    Yesterday's arrests may prove uncomfortable for Sino-Japanese relations. Senior Japanese officials recently assured Beijing of Tokyo's willingness to push for reduced Western restrictions on technology sales to China. The promises are aimed at mollifying China over a ban last year on the Toshiba unit's exports, and the export scrutiny that resulted in the arrests.    MITI officials said last month that Kyokuto illegally exported to China five digital memories, a sampling oscilloscope and a signal analyzer, while Shinsei Koeki shipped two digital memories. The equipment can be used in testing nuclear explosions, fine-tuning radar and detecting submarines, MITI said.    Arrested yesterday were Kyokuto's managing director, Yoshikazu Ono, and its trade-section chief, Teruko Takeuchi. Shinsei Koeki's managing director, Yasuhiko Kusabe, also was arrested. </TEXT></DOC>
