The Carter administration demanded a full accounting from theSoviets in 1980, saying it had ``disturbing indications'' that theepidemic was caused by ``some sort of lethal biological agent.''   But according to a lecture and slide show presented by Soviethealth officials over the last week in Washington, Baltimore andCambridge, Mass., the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminatedbone meal fed to livestock, whose meat, in turn, caused the deathsof 66 people in Sverdlovsk, a city of 1.2 million in the UralMountains.   The long-awaited Soviet explanation ``leaves many questionsunanswered,'' said Gary B. Crocker, a State Department analystspecializing in questions relating to Soviet military use ofbiological and chemical weapons. ``It does not fit with theevidence and facts we have collected on the issue,'' he said.   In 1986, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency released areport alleging that the anthrax came from the Microbiology andVirology Institute, a top-secret military research facility inSverdlovsk.   The Pentagon report said ``a pressurized system probablyexploded'' at the institute, spewing as much as 22 pounds ofanthrax spores into the air, and that ``hundreds'' of Sovietcitizens died.   Anthrax, an infectious disease which occurs naturally, isconsidered a deadly candidate for use in biological weapons. A 1975treaty signed by both superpowers bars possession of biologicalweapons and significant quantities of biological agents, but allowsresearch ostensibly aimed at biowarfare defenses.   James Oberg, author of the recent book ``Uncovering SovietDisasters,'' said he believes the Soviet health officials ``aretelling the truth'' in blaming the outbreak on a batch ofcontaminated meat rather than germ-warfare experiments.   ``But they are not telling the whole truth,'' said Oberg.   ``They should have said this eight or nine years ago,'' saidOberg, who urged the Soviets to open the Sverdlovsk researchfacility to Western observers. ``The damage has been done,'' hesaid. ``It will take a lot more of this kind of disclosure to undothe damage that Soviet paranoid secrecy has inflicted oninternational relations.''   The Soviets had long denied the U.S. allegations, but hadoffered little evidence to refute them. The more detailed rebuttallast week came from Dr. Pyotr N. Burgasov, former deputy Soviethealth minister, Dr. Vladimir N. Nikiforov, chief infectiousdisease specialist at the Moscow Institute for the AdvancedTraining of Physicians, and Dr. Vladimir P. Sergiyev, of the Soviethealth ministry.   The heart of their argument, bolstered by gory autopsy slides,was that the victims suffered severe damage to their intestines,indicating they ate rather than inhaled the anthrax.   The DIA report had said ``hundreds of Soviet citizens died frominhalation of anthrax,'' and that others suffered after eating themeat of animals who had inhaled the deadly spores.   The Soviet officials declined to answer questions about the workperformed at the Sverdlovsk research lab. But, in circumstantialrefutation of the U.S. allegations, they said no one at the labbecame ill during the outbreak.</TEXT></DOC>
