Withthe passage of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-418), and the replacement of the Tariff Schedules of the UnitedStates with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS),Customs is experiencing a far greater use of the administrative rulingsprogram than ever before.Accordingly, Customs published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 8208) on February 27, 1989, proposingchanges in its ruling program to accommodate its increased use by importers,to improve Customs responsiveness to the ruling requests received, andto promote greater uniformity in the decisions being issued. The amendmentsproposed to: (1) Create a new procedure to promote nationwide uniformityin Customs decisions; (2) allow commercial importers to receive bindingrulings on tariff classification under the HTSUS at Customs districts;(3) clarify the circumstances under which the effective date of a rulingcan be delayed in recognition of an importer's reliance on a previous,more favorable ruling; (4) clarify the obligations of a recipient of atariff classification ruling letter if entry of merchandise described inthe ruling letter is subsequently made; (5) remove the ``clearly wrong''test as the standard by which Customs determines whether certain establishedand uniform practices should be changed; and (6) clarify the extent towhich previously issued rulings can be the subject of a request for internaladvice.Fourteen comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking.A summary of each proposed change and a discussion of comments regardingthe proposed change follows.<ITAG tagnum="84">District Ruling Program</ITAG>SummaryCommercial importers may apply in writing for an advance binding tariffclassification under the HTSUS at the Customs district where the merchandisewill be imported or at any other district where the importer would havereason to do business. This program began January 1, 1989, on a trial basis.All rulings issued under this program are binding for the recipient atall ports of entry. The target turn-around time for a binding ruling underthis program is 30 days, or 120 days if Headquarters must be involved.Proposed changes to the Customs Regulations to implement this program involvedexpanding the authority to issue prospective tariff classification rulingsfrom Headquarters and the Regional Commissioner, New York, to all Customsdistricts and to limit each request to a district office for a ruling tofive merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind.The proposed rule also stated that in addition to the information prescribedin andSection; 177.2(b)(1), (2)(i) and (ii), and (5), Customs Regulations(19 CFR 177.2(b)(1), (2)(i) and (ii), and (5)), when submitting a rulingrequest, a request to the district must include the name of the manufacturerand seller (if available), the country of origin and the importer of recordnumber which will be used at entry.Discussion of CommentsComments were generally favorable regarding the institution of the districtrulings program. Some commenters recommended that the scope of the programbe broadened to cover Customs rulings in areas other than tariff classification.It was also recommended that we not limit each ruling request to a districtoffice to five merchandise items.With the enactment of the HTSUS, the resources of the district ruling programwere of necessity directed toward providing tariff classification adviceon an expedited basis. Customs now does not have the resources to expandthe program to other rulings.In order to afford the importing community equal access to expedited rulings,it is necessary to limit district rulings program ruling requests to fiveitems. It is Customs intent to issue all of its rulings as expeditiouslyas possible. With this goal in mind, we will periodically review the programto ascertain ways in which it can better serve the public. Also, Customs has recently established uniform procedures for providingpre-entry classification decisions to the importing public. These procedures_whichshift the emphasis of the classification function from transaction basedanalysis after importation to up-front advice regarding future importations_aredesigned to complement the district rulings program by expeditiously supplyingimporters with binding classification rulings. While participation in thepre-entry classification program is granted on a case-by-case basis, allmerchandise is eligible for consideration. It has been pointed out that in certain industries, importations routinelyoccur simultaneously with the filing of requests for binding rulings. Becausethe district rulings program is limited to ``prospective'' transactions,certain importers were concerned that they may not be able to avail themselvesof the program's expeditious procedures. While the district rulings program is limited to prospective transactions,this does not preclude the importing public from receiving district rulingsfor ``continuing transactions''_i.e., while a district ruling will notbe issued regarding transactions currently pending before a field office,an importer may still receive a binding ruling regarding prospective transactions(that is, later importations) involving merchandise which is identicalto that involved in a current transaction. Internal Advice procedures areavailable for current transactions. Some commenters took issue with the requirement that an importer providethe name of the manufacturer or seller when seeking a district ruling.They argue that the name of the manufacturer or seller is irrelevant toa classification decision. Further, an importer often will not have chosenhis sources until receipt of the ruling letter. Sourcing is frequentlychanged for various business reasons such as pricing, quota restraintsand production demands. Customs is well aware that when an importer submits a request for a bindingruling the manufacturer or seller is often unknown. This information isrequired only if known. While we agree that this information would haveno bearing on the classification issue, submission of the manufactureror seller's name would aid in the facilitation of quota requirements andstreamline processing at both release and summary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Uniformity of Customs Officers' Decisions </ITAG>Summary Section 7361(c) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Title VI, Pub. L. 100-690)_requiresthe Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to provide fornationwide uniformity of certain decisions made by Customs officers andto establish procedures by which certain parties affected by the lack ofsuch uniformity may have the alleged inconsistencies resolved. Accordingly,Customs proposed procedures to permit port authorities and any party entitledto either protest a decision of the Customs Service under the protest proceduresset forth in sections 514 and 515 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended(19 U.S.C. 1514,1515), or utilize the Domestic Interested Party petitionprocedures set forth in section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended(19 U.S.C. 1516) to petition the Customs Service for resolution of an inconsistencyor lack of uniformity alleged to exist in: (1) A decision of a Customsofficer permitted to be protested by section 514(a) of the Tariff Act of1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)), or (2) decisions to conduct intensifiedexaminations or inspections of merchandise at various ports of entry. It was proposed that the petitioning party be required to furnish informationsufficient to document the alleged inconsistency. For tariff classificationrulings, competing entries must be identified as to port of entry, dateand entry number, and the merchandise must be fully described. In the caseof alleged inconsistencies in the inspection or examination of merchandise,the petitioning party must furnish information sufficient to document thata pattern of inconsistency exists. A ``pattern of inconsistency'' was definedas three or more documented instances in which inspections or examinationswere conducted within a particular port that appear inconsistent with inspectionor examination decisions of another port or ports when substantially identicalshipments are involved. Upon receipt of a properly filed petition, Customswill immediately verify the facts alleged and upon verification will publisha notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that the petition has been received, describingthe alleged inconsistency, and permit 15 days for public comment. Afteranalysis of the public comment, Customs will issue a decision to the petitioner,transmit copies to the ports involved and publish a summary of the decisionin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and Customs Bulletin. The response to a petitionis not protestable. Discussion of Comments Commenters, although generally in favor of the uniformity procedures, hadthe following concerns. Some commenters suggested that we more clearlydefine what consititutes a ``pattern of inconsistency.'' In the preambleof the proposed regulations, it was stated that a pattern of inconsistencymust be shown regarding ``substantially identical shipments'' within aparticular port, while the proposed regulation stated the pattern of inconsistencymust be established where ``substantially similar'' merchandise is involved.Some commenters were also unclear as to whether the inconsistencies mustall occur in one port. Customs wishes to clarify. A ``pattern of inconsistency'' would exist wherethree or more instances are documented in which inspections or examinationsare conducted that appear inconsistent with other inspection and examinationdecisions when substantially similar merchandise is involved. The threeor more instances of inconsistency may occur in different ports. Whileinconsistencies involving shipments of the same importer, manufacturer,commodity and country of origin may clearly be the subject of this petitioningprocess, inconsistencies involving shipments that are not identical, butsubstantially similar, may also be the subject of a petition.Some commenters believe that Customs response to a petition for consistenttreatment should be protestable.Customs believes that this is unnecessary. Section 514 of the Tariff Actof 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514) provides when an action by Customsis protestable. A petitioner who alleges inconsistent treatment and isdissatisfied with Customs is not entitled to protest unless there is anactual liquidation or other action subject to protest under Part 174, CustomsRegulations (19 CFR Part 174) and sections 514 and 515 of the Tariff Actof 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514 and 1515).It was commented that steps should be taken that when a ``multiple petition''is returned to a sender, accompanied by a copy of the accepted petition,confidential information is not disclosed regarding the accepted petition.Customs agrees. A provision is added to the regulations requiring a petitionerto provide a ``sanitized'' copy of his petition.Other commenters stated that the applicable public comment period on apetition should be increased from 15 to at least 30 days.Customs believes that a 15 day comment period is appropriate. This timeframe is necessary in order for Customs to expidite the issuance of itsdecisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Delaying the Effective Date of Certain Rules</ITAG>SummaryCustoms proposed to amend andSection; 177.9, Customs Regualtions (19 CFR177.9) to specify that it may, from time to time, delay the effective dateof rulings which modify or reverse earlier written rulings, or which modifythe manner in which Customs has treated ``substantially identical'' transactionsin the past. Customs may provide for the delay on its own initiative orit may act upon a request for a delay made by the recipient of the ruling.Discussion of Comments It was recommended by a commenter that equitable relief should be grantednot only in cases of detrimental reliance, but also in cases where an importeris placed at a competitive disadvantage owing to inequality of treatment.By requiring a showing of detrimental reliance, it is argued that importersfor whom rulings are pending_and who thus cannot claim a lack of knowledgethat the rate of duty may increase on their merchandise_are disadvantagedvis-a-vis other importers of the same type merchandise who, because theyare not party to the ruling, are in a position to establish the requiredreliance for a grant of delay of an effective date of a ruling. Customs does not agree with this commenter's reading of the language inproposed 19 CFR 177.9(d)(3). The section states that ``a delay may be grantedwith respect to the party to whom the ruling letter was issued or to anyother party, provided such party can demonstrate * * * that they reasonablyrelied on the earlier ruling to their detriment.'' In effect, insofar ascoverage under the proposed rule is not limited to importers who lack knowledgeregarding the pendency of an issue before Customs which may result in ahigher rate of duty for their importations, the rule does not penalizeone importer vis-a-vis another importer of the same merchandise. Rather,the rule is specifically intended to afford importers an opportunity tomake whatever adjustments are necessary once they become aware of a possiblemodification of Customs treatment. Under the proposed rule, it is envisionedthat Customs will carefully examine all relevant factors in making a determinationof whether and for how long to grant a delay in an effective date of aruling. It was also recommended that we extend the period for granting delays inthe effective date of rulings from 90 days, to 180 days, or even to 360days. Customs disagrees. While our proposed amendment is intended to mitigatethe adverse impact of rulings modifying earlier rulings relied upon byimporters, sound public policy also requires that we give expeditious effectto the requirements of the law. We believe that limiting any delay to 90days properly balances these considerations. Another commenter suggested that we reduce from two years the period forwhich an affected party must demonstrate that Customs treatment was sufficientlycontinuous to establish that the party reasonably relied on receiving suchtreatment in arranging future transactions. Customs believes the importer is misreading the language of the amendment.The requirement that an affected party submit evidence covering a 2 yearperiod is not to be interpreted as requiring substantially identical transactionsspanning an entire 2 year period. Rather, an importer is required to listand otherwise provide whatever relevant evidence exists for the 2 yearperiod immediately prior to the date of the issuance of the modifying ruling.Finally, it has been suggested that we delete the language which wouldallow Customs, in analyzing past liquidations claimed to be inconsistentwith a subsequently issued ruling, to give ``diminished weight'' to liquidationsinvolving ``transactions of small quantities or values'' or merchandisewhich has been ``processed without examination and/or import specialistreview.'' Delaying the effective date of rulings constitutes an exercise of discretionaryauthority based on the equitable principle of reliance. In determiningwhether and for how long to delay the effective date of a ruling whichso qualifies, Customs should be able to consider all relevant factors.The extent to which Customs has physically examined previous importationsor carefully reviewed information on prior transactions are relevant factors.<ITAG tagnum="84">Obligation of Recipients of Letter Rulings </ITAG>Summary Customs proposed to amend andSection; 177.8(a)(2), Customs Regulations (19CFR 177.8(a)(2)) to expressly set forth the obligation of an importer toenter merchandise under a tariff classification consistent with that containedin any classification ruling received by the importer which is in effect.The amendment also requires that a copy of the ruling be attached to thedocuments filed with the appropriate Customs office in connection withthat transaction or shall otherwise indicate with the information filedfor that transaction that a ruling has been received. Discussion of Comments Some commenters stated that there is no justification for requiring eitherthat a copy of a ruling letter be submitted or that each transaction includea statement that a ruling has been issued. They believe that this wouldimpose an unnecessary burden and expense on importers. Customs expends considerable resources in providing tariff classificationsto the importing public. Insofar as Customs is bound by the classificationrulings it issues, it is only appropriate that the importing public bebound as well. Although Customs shares the aversion to requiring an additional piece ofpaper in the entry summary package, one of our major considerations isto ensure that Customs honors its commitment to uniformly apply rulingdecisions throughout the country. Without a method for the Import Specialistto know that a ruling exists, an importer risks having summaries rejectedor classifications changed due to different views.Customs is considering implementing a procedure where, under certain circumstances,a ruling could be filed once at each port of entry where the merchandiseis entered and reference made to the ruling number on each summary line.We are programming rulings indicators in the Automated Commercial Systems(ACS) on the summary line item screens. When this becomes operational,a copy of a ruling will not be required for Automated Broker Interface(ABI) filers for summary filing. We are also developing a rulings modulein ACS to ease field access to rulings. Until that time, however, we believeit is critical to uniformity and in the best interest of the importer torequire a paper copy.Some commenters state that they are entitled to enter merchandise at thetariff rate they feel is warranted.Customs believes that if a ruling is requested, it should be followed.Making entry consistent with a binding Customs ruling in no way diminishesthe available avenues of administrative appeal. Protests may still be filedunder Part 174, Customs Regulations, and section 514 of the Tariff Actof 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514).Some commenters suggested that we should clarify what constitutes a ``rulingletter'' and provide assurance that only the specific party to whom a rulingis issued is requested to submit that ruling to Customs.To the extent that the proposed amendment may be ambiguous regarding whatconstitutes a ruling letter, the amendment is revised to make it clearthat it contemplates coverage limited to binding classification rulings,including pre-entry classification decisions issued under Part 177 of theregulations to the party to be bound. It is Customs intent that this amendmentdoes not apply to parties other than those parties to whom the ruling letterin question is issued.Finally, it has been suggested that Customs should enumerate the specificpenalty proceedings which may be instituted against importers who entermerchandise contrary to the requirements set forth in the amendment.Customs disagrees. As with Customs penalty proceedings in general, penaltiesmay vary depending on a range of factors, such as the differential in therate of duties, the degree of negligence and the value of the merchandiseinvolved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Elimination of ``Clearly Wrong'' Test</ITAG>SummaryCustoms proposed to remove the ``clearly wrong'' standard from andSection;177.10(b) of the Customs Regulations.Discussion of CommentsIt has been suggested that our proposal to eliminate the ``clearly wrong''test is misguided. Specifically, it is argued that the test should be retainedbecause it promotes certainty and uniformity in the importing process.We do not believe that removal of this provision would adversely affectthe importing community. Under the relevant statutory and case law, Customsmay only disturb a practice if there exists a compelling reason to do so,and only then after full consideration of public comment. In short, webelieve the test has proven to be unrealistic, unnecessary and confusing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After careful consideration of all the comments received and further reviewof the matter, it has been determined that the amendments, with the modificationsdiscussed above, should be adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The document does not meet the criteria for a ``major rule'' as definedin section 1(b) of E.O. 12291.

Althoughsuch a ruling letter will generally be effective on the date it is issued,the Customs Service may, upon application by an affected party, delay theeffective date of the ruling letter, and continue the treatment previouslyaccorded the substantially identical transaction, for a period of up to90 days from the date the ruling letter is issued.(2) <T3>Applications by affected parties.</T3> In applying to the Customs Servicefor a delay in the effective date of a ruling letter described in paragraph(e)(1) of this section, an affected party must demonstrate to the satisfactionof the Customs Service that the treatment previously accorded by Customsto the substantially identical transactions was sufficiently consistentand continuous that such party reasonably relied thereon in arranging forfuture transactions. The evidence of past treatment by the Customs Serviceshall cover the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the rulingletter, listing all substantially identical transactions by entry number(or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandisecovered by each such transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry,and the dates of final action by the Customs Service. The evidence of relianceshall include contracts, purchase orders, or other materials tending toestablish that the future transactions were arranged based on the treatmentpreviously accorded by the Customs Service.(3) <T3>Decision by Customs to grant delay.</T3> The Customs Service will examineall factors relevant to the issue of reliance in determining whether, andfor what period, to delay the effective date of a ruling letter describedin paragraph (e)(1) of this section. In particular, the Customs Servicewill examine the past transactions on which reliance is claimed to determinewhether there was an examination of the merchandise (where applicable)by the Customs Service or the extent to which those transactions were otherwiseexamined and analyzed by the Customs Service to determine the proper applicationof the Customs laws and regulations. In general, transactions involvingsmall quantities or values, as well as informal entries and other entriesor transactions which the Customs Service, in the interest of commercialfacilitation and accommodation, processes expeditiously and without examinationand/or import specialist review, will be given diminished weight in establishingthe required history of consistent and continuous Customs treatment. Unlessa notice covering all affected parties is published in the <T3>Customs Bulletin</T3>, each affected party applying for a delay inthe effective date of the ruling letter will be advised in a separate rulingletter of the extent to which a delay in the effective date will be appliedto their transactions.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 177.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]</ITAG>11.
