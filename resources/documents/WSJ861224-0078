The FCC proposal &quot;should send a clear signal,&quot; said FCC Chairman Mark Fowler. &quot;We'd like to see progress made with regard to other countries opening their borders&quot; to U.S. telecommunications companies, he said.    But the proposal is certain to run into a host of legal and political problems. FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis expressed concern that the agency lacked authority to block U.S. sales because of trade concerns, and that the initiative would backfire. &quot;Actions appearing to be heavy-handed may cause (foreign countries) to retreat from liberalization,&quot; she said.    Nevertheless, Ms. Dennis joined a 4-0 vote to begin an inquiry on how the FCC should carry out its proposal and whether it had sufficient legal authority. An inquiry is a preliminary step in forming regulations, and final FCC action may be more than a year off.    The FCC also proposed to require foreign manufacturers to report how much equipment they sell in the U.S. and require U.S. telephone companies to provide information on foreign purchases. In addition, the agency proposed to license foreign companies that provide &quot;enhanced&quot; communications services, such as electronic mail.    The agency didn't single out any country or company as the target of its action. But Mr. Fowler has said his anger over the trade issue was sparked by the West German government's bid to block American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. from buying Cie. Generale des Constructions Telephoniques, a French state-owned concern that makes telephone switches.    Last month, Mr. Fowler threatened to retaliate if West German officials, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, succeed in convincing the French government to reject ATandamp;T's bid and instead sell the company to Siemens AG. The West Germans contend that an American beachhead in the European telecommunications market would hurt French-West German commercial relations.    Since November, both the French government and Siemens have sought to defuse the issue. France decided to limit foreign ownership of the French company to 20% and Siemens promised to make telephone switches in the U.S.    Thomas Casey, a Washington lawyer for Siemens, said the company was &quot;encouraged&quot; that the agency didn't name Siemens individually in its proposal.    But a Washington communications attorney said the FCC's continuing interest in trade issues could hurt Siemens, which had U.S. revenue of $2.2 billion in the year ended Sept. 30. &quot;Whether the agency is entitled to act is almost irrelevant,&quot; he said. &quot;If Fowler continues to make harsh pronouncements, he can have an effect on procurements&quot; of Siemens equipment in the U.S.    The FCC must answer some thorny questions before proceeding, including how to decide whether a company is foreign. Albert Halprin, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said the agency didn't know whether to consider stock ownership, location of assets, numbers of employees or other criteria in making that determination.    Philip Verveer, a former chief of the common carrier bureau, said the FCC &quot;isn't well equipped&quot; to make trade decisions. Partly in response to such criticisms, the FCC said it may block sales only after the executive branch determines that a foreign government discriminates against U.S. companies.    In addition, the agency proposed setting up a fair-trade model, which it would consult before taking action.    Officials at the State and Commerce departments said the FCC is coordinating its actions with them. Alfred Sikes, an assistant secretary of commerce, denied speculation that the FCC is acting provocatively to make the rest of the U.S. government seem moderate in comparison on trade issues. &quot;The seriousness of the U.S. government position is underscored by the FCC's step,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
