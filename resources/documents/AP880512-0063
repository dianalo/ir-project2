The Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star reported in a front-pagedispatch from its military correspondents at Soviet headquarters inKabul that there is great anxiety about the withdrawal that beginsSunday.   ``They are facing 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) of mountainous,war-torn roads,'' the newspaper said of Soviet soldiers who will beamong the first to pull out of the Soviet Union's southernneighbor. ``And we know very well that roads in Afghanistan are onthe forward edge of the undeclared war. It is necessary to beprepared for the possibility of armed provocations.''   The newspaper said rebel activity had been stepped up in Kabul,Kandahar, Ghazni, Paktia and other provinces.   ``Taking advantage of the pullback of Soviet and Afghan troopsfrom border areas of those regions in the depth of the country, theopposition and its foreign patrons have sharply increased thenumber of caravans with weapons, delivering them _ not only atnight now but also in the daytime,'' the paper claimed.   ``In the military formations there has been a noticeable growthin the number of foreign military advisers, who organize jointactions by groups from different Moslem parties,'' the newspapersaid.   The United States has been the insurgents' chief arms supplier.   Red Star said the preparations for withdrawal were nearlycomplete at the Kabul headquarters of the ``limited militarycontingent,'' as the 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan arereferred to in the state-run press.   The dispatch did not make clear, however, how many would leavein the first march north or when headquarters would be evacuated.   It said the first troops to leave would be motorized rifleregiments, paratroopers, scouts and pilots, but gave no otherdetails.   Afghanistan has been in the throes of civil war since April1978, when a Soviet-inspired revolution brought a Marxistgovernment to power.   Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to install BabrakKarmal as the Afghan leader and to help troops loyal to him putdown a widespread insurrection. Karmal was replaced by Najib in May1986 and has since taken refuge in the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
