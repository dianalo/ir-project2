Picka complimentary adjective to describe prototype NFL return- and third-downspecialists and the Bills used it Wednesday as they prepared for Sunday'sSuper Bowl against the New York Giants.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Special Section  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MEGGETT CAN STING LIKE A BEETHIS GIANT CAN FLY, AND BILLS ARE BUZZINGABOUT WAYS TO STOP HIM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV: A Viewer's Guide  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;When he has the ball, you have to make sure all the creases are pluggedand the lanes are filled,&quot; Buffalo defensive coordinator Walt Corey said. &quot;Heis a daylight runner. I don't know what kind of speed he has, but hisquickness seems to get him ahead of everyone. Once that happens, you're introuble.&quot;;    Meggett is the Giants' only offensive game-breaker, just like ayear ago. He can beat an opponent with a run, a pass or a return.;    He ledthe NFL in kickoff returns this season with a 23.4-yard average, and his 10.9punt-return average was second in the NFC.;    But the big difference inMeggett this season is that he is not breaking the big one. He has scored onlytwice, down three from a year ago, and he hasn't broken a big play since Dec.9 when the 5-foot-7 speedster had a 37-yard punt return and a 58-yard kickoffreturn against Minnesota.;    He has caught only five passes for 20 yards ormore -- no touchdowns -- and only five of his 22 rushes were for at least 10yards.;    &quot;As far as the numbers are concerned, the numbers were not there,&quot;Meggett said. &quot;I didn't have as many big returns or long runs from scrimmage.I was more confident this year and didn't make the stupid mistakes. But Iwould have loved better numbers.&quot;;    Bills special-teams coach Bruce DeHavencalled the second-year pro from Towson State the best return player in thegame.;    &quot;He is scary,&quot; DeHaven said. &quot;He makes good decisions, and he has aphenomenal change of direction. He has super leg drive, and he's tough totackle. Right now, he's my biggest nightmare.&quot;;    Meggett did little againstBuffalo in the Bills' 17-13 win over New York on Dec. 15. He returned twopunts for 13 yards, didn't handle any of the four kickoffs, carried the balltwice for 6 yards and caught two passes for 16 yards.;    Bills linebacker andspecial-teams player Hal Garner said the key to stopping Meggett on returns isdiscipline, having people staying in their lanes and not going for the legs,because he'll break those tackles. &quot;To prepare for him, you have to be awareof his capabilities and know he is back there,&quot; said Steve Tasker, the Bills'special-teams leader.;    Meggett had an outstanding season in 1989, catchingshort passes out of the backfield and turning them for big yards, includingtouchdowns of 62, 57, 53 and 33 yards. He had 34 receptions for 531 yards, or15.6 per catch.;    The receptions increased to 39 this season, but theaverage dipped to 10.5. His punt-return average also dropped from 12.7 to10.9.;    Meggett also ran into the problem of being a role player in abackfield that included Ottis Anderson and top draft pick Rodney Hampton, whobroke his left leg against Chicago in the opening round of the playoffs.;   The injury helped Meggett's playing time. He had 10 carries for 36 yards inthe win over the 49ers in the NFC championship game, equaling his total forthe previous nine weeks.;    Expect to see Meggett more Sunday, eitherspelling Anderson or trying to help New York spread the Buffalo defense.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tampa, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910125  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  611  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday January 25, 199100025170,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
