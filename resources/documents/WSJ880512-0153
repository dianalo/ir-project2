The West German chemicals company said pretax earnings increased to 795 million marks ($474.3 million) from 715 million marks in 1987's first quarter, as group sales rose 5.7%, to 9.99 billion marks ($5.96 billion) from 9.46 billion marks. An 8% rise in sales volume more than offset the impact of the weak dollar, Chairman Hermann Strenger said. Sales declined 3% in all of 1987 and 11% in 1986.    Bayer was the last of Germany's three major chemicals concerns to post first-quarter results. Its 11% pretax-profit increase was above the 7.5% gain reported by BASF AG but below the 20% rise reported by Hoechst AG.    &quot;All three chemicals (companies) had excellent figures,&quot; said Brian Wilkinson, an analyst at Scrimgeour andamp; Vickers in London. &quot;The first quarter is traditionally weak, but we see some exceptional strength here.&quot;    Barring an unexpected slowing in the world economy, Mr. Strenger said, Bayer's sales are likely to rise between 3% and 4% this year.    Bayer was unchanged at 253.50 marks ($151.23) in a weak Frankfurt stock market yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
