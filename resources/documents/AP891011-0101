The protesters demandedthe release of a dissident publisher.   Police and opposition leaders said the casualties included 14officers and 14 members of the opposition Democratic ProgressiveParty. A policeman and four other people were reported hospitalizedwith serious injuries.   Protest leaders said they believed many demonstrators did notreport their injuries, and estimated total casualties at about 50.It was one of the most violent encounters in Taiwan sincedemonstrations were legalized two years ago.   Demonstrations outside the Tucheng jail in a Taipei suburb beganTuesday, Taiwan's National Day, when 10,000 people gathered todemand the immediate release of publisher Hsu Hsin-liang, 48.   Chang Chun-hung, leader of the opposition party, said ofWednesday's violence: ``The police mercilessly launched the bloodyattack on the peaceful crowd under instruction of the rulingNationalist Party. The demonstration would have ended peacefully ifthe police did not disperse us with force.''   On a videotape shown at Chang's news conference, police wereseen firing water cannons and swinging clubs at protesters, some ofwhom shouted ``Peace! Peace!'' Chang said police also smashed a van.   Earlier Wednesday, police arrested 15 protesters who allegedlyattacked them, then released all the detainees on bail. Among themwas Hsu's wife, Lin Cheng-chien, who police said was hospitalizedwith serious bone fractures.   Nationalist Party spokesman James Chu said the opposition shouldbe held responsible for Wednesday's violence because severalprotesters threw stones and attacked police.   ``They apparently ignored the laws and barely understand thatmost people want a peaceful society,'' he said.   Protesters wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow flowersrallied outside the jail Tuesday and said they would sleep thereuntil they were allowed to meet with Hsu.   About 3,000 protesters remained past midnight and the two-hourbattle began when police moved in at 3 a.m.   Police contended the demonstration was illegal because protestleaders did not apply for permission. They said the protesters weredispersed to avoid violence and restore the free movement oftraffic.   Hsu was jailed after his return last month from 10 years in theUnited States. He made the last stage of trip on a fishing boatfrom mainland China.   The government accuses him of helping organize ananti-government demonstration in 1979 Kaohsiung port. Protestleaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at demanding morepolitical freedom.   The Nationalists fled the Chinese mainland when the communistswon the civil war in 1949 and have governed Taiwan since.</TEXT></DOC>
