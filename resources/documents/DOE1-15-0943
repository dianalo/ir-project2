The techniques requiredto use water infusion are presented in detail. A Bureau case study indicatedthat water infusion reduced dust levels by 68% along a longwall plowface, bringing this section into compliance with the 2.0-mg/cu m Federaldust standard. Similar studies conducted by Occidental Research Corp.under a Bureau contract show that water infusion at two longwall double-drumshearer operations produced dust reductions ranging from 38 to 50%. Waterinfusion was found to be cost effective, averaging 5 cents per ton.</TEXT></DOC>
