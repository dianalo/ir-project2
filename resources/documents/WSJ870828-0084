Elias Zinn, president of Entertainment Marketing, a distributor of electronic equipment, said the suit seeks to compel the Crazy Eddie board to disclose what steps the once-high-flying electronics retailer is taking to reverse recent losses.    &quot;As a leading shareholder of that company, we and all shareholders are entitled to some explanation,&quot; Mr. Zinn said. A spokeswoman for Crazy Eddie declined to comment on the suit.    Last month, Entertainment Marketing withdrew its offer of $8 a share, or about $239 million, to acquire the company, because Crazy Eddie wouldn't provide specific financial information.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Crazy Eddie closed at $4.25 a share, up 12.5 cents. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Entertainment Marketing closed at $9 a share, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
