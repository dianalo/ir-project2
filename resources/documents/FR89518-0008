Schroer, Systemsand Equipment Branch, ANM-130S; telephone (206) 431-1937. Mailing address:FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle,Washington 98168.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A Model 737-300 operator has reportedthe loss of both Inertial Reference Units (IRU) during one flight. Thisdual loss during flight resulted in loss of primary attitude indicationto the pilot, necessitating the use of the Standby Attitude Indicator.The dropout of both IRU's was caused by failure indications by the internaltest (BITE) of the IRU's.The FAA has also received a second report of an incident where anotherModel 737-300 series airplane experienced dual in-flight shutdown of theIRU's, apparently due to this same problem.The FAA has been advised that certain IRU's, P/N S242T101-103, were manufacturedwith a component which prevents proper operation of the BITE function tosignal a fault when a gyro approaches the end of its normal service life.This component is heat sensitive and, as the temperature of the IRU's increases,this component then allows activation of the delayed failure indication.Two IRU's with this condition could both fail on the same airplane whentemperature conditions are raised above a certain threshold.This condition, if not corrected, could result in in-flight loss of primaryattitude indication to both pilots. Loss of both primary attitude displaysduring the final phase of a landing or during an ETOPS flight could resultin unacceptable crew workload and a hazard under poor weather conditions.Airplanes equipped with the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS),have a different electronic equipment cooling system and are not subjectto the same IRU failures.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>Extended range operations with two-engine transport categoryairplanes is defined in FAA Advisory Circular 120-42A as an operation overa route that contains a point farther than one hour flying time at thenormal one-engine inoperative cruise speed (in still air) from an adequateairport, in deviation from andSection; 121.161 of the Federal Aviation Regulations;and is referred to as ``ETOP'' operations.</ITAG>The FAA has reviewed and approved Honeywell Service Bulletin HG1050AD-34-04,dated December 1, 1987, which describes modification of IRU P/N S242T101-103to incorporate Mod 6, which includes the correct component to allow properoperation of the BITE function; and Honeywell Service Bulletin HG1050AD-34-03,Revision A, dated February 15, 1989, which describes an in-service modificationto change IRU P/N S242T101-103 to P/N S242T101-105 ``User Friendly'' configurations.Modification in accordance with either of these bulletins will correctfor the condition described in this AD.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design, this AD requires an Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)revision that restricts approach operations to certain weather conditions;and prohibits Extended Range operation for those Model 737-300 airplanes,not equipped with an EFIS, with IRU P/N S242T101-103 installed, until theP/N S242T101-103 units have Mod 6 incorporated or have been updated tothe P/N S242T101-105 configuration, in accordance with the service bulletinspreviously mentioned.The FAA intends to revise this AD to require either the incorporation ofMod 6 in all IRU P/N's S242T101-3, or replacement of all IRU P/N's S242T101-103with P/N's S242T101-105. However, the proposed compliance time for theserequirements is sufficiently long so that notice and public comment willnot be impracticable.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this document involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this actionis subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation, afinal regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
