Although producing good video material requires artistic skills many business people don't have, the technology is becoming accessible, says Clay Gordon, a consultant with InterConsult, Cambridge, Mass. &quot;We'll find a large segment of the presentations community will move away from 35mm slides&quot; to video presentations, he says.    Joan D. Tierney, an independent television producer in Washington, D.C., says she is using a Macintosh II computer and a video recorder to produce a PBS documentary. The computer has a special video card made by Computer Friends Inc., Portland, Ore., that makes it possible to add computer graphics to videotape or superimpose them on big-screen TVs.    &quot;Desktop video is going to explode,&quot; she says, because it lets producers, advertising agencies and corporate trainers edit videos and add captions and graphics at a fraction of the cost of renting television studio equipment. At Boston's MacWorld trade show earlier this month, Ms. Tierney demonstrated an $80,000 Macintosh-based system that she says does work comparable to that of a $400,000 TV studio.    Computer Friends says its 1,500 customers for the $1,500 TV Producer board include makers of animated children's films, corporate training films and flight simulators. Even a limited system costs at least $12,000, including the computer with the card and video camcorder, Computer Friends says.    Truevision Inc. in Indianapolis, whose Targa boards lead the IBM-compatible market for combining video and computer images, will soon start selling a $4,250 board for the Macintosh, because &quot;most video people want to use a Mac,&quot; says Steve Kukla, Truevision's market development manager. -   Orders for Design Aid   Higher Than Expected   DESIGN ENGINEERS are snapping up a new device that converts designs created on a computer into three-dimensional plastic models.    About one order a week is coming in to 3D Systems Inc., Sylmar, Calif., for its $175,000 Fotoform machines, ahead of earlier projections. All five test users, including General Motors Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co., have decided to buy their test devices and ordered second machines, says Ralph Schubert, 3D's vice president of marketing and sales.    The desk-sized devices use a technique called stereolithography to make models, layer by layer. Fotoforms contain a bath of liquid plastic that hardens when exposed to an ultraviolet light beam. The beam is controlled by the computer design. After a thin layer of the model is hardened, the model is lowered slightly into the bath so that a new layer can be formed on top of it. The bath is somewhat smaller than a cubic foot, but parts can be combined outside the machine to form larger models.    Michael Seely, an analyst with Dataquest Corp., a market-research firm in San Jose, Calif., says, &quot;This is a forerunner of a very important manufacturing technology.&quot; Beyond helping in design, he says, &quot;it's reasonable to expect it in other applications -- maybe in full manufacturing.&quot;    Endowing Computers   With Visual Smarts   THIS COLUMN has lots of visual clues that let readers know, among other things, that technology is the subject, Bulkeley is the reporter and this item is separate from the next.    But computers that can read words haven't been able to understand the meaning of headline size, boldface type or extra spacing. Now, however, Data Conversion Laboratory has designed software to use such clues in organizing material.    One customer is publishing an index of 1,000 books on a topic. For them, &quot;we built a special-purpose version of the software to read and analyze indexes,&quot; says Mark Gross, president of Data Conversion, Fresh Meadows, N.Y. Among other things, the software -- which works with optical character recognition systems from Palantir Corp., Santa Clara, Calif. -- can recognize subtopics and recognize whether a number is a page or a date.    Another customer, R.R. Bowker, publishes an optical disk containing not only the 770,000 listings from its Books in Print reference work, but some 50,000 short book reviews as well. The book reviews come from six different magazines, each organized differently. To organize the information, the software had to figure out the book title, the author's name and the publisher by analyzing the way the reviews were presented. &quot;One of the hardest things was to figure out where each review ended,&quot; says a Bowker spokesman.    Scanning and indexing military manuals for conversion to optical disks is an emerging market, Mr. Gross says. The software can be taught to recognize highlighted warnings or boldface notices as well as other types of information. &quot;We can split it apart into pieces and build a data base out of the text,&quot; he says.    Odds and Ends   FIBRONICS International Inc., Hyannis, Mass., is in stalling a fiber-optic network on the Italian Autostrade that eventually will permit automatic toll collection. Drivers will be able to insert a cash card into a two-way car radio as they exit, and the charge will be debited to the driver's bank account. . . . Accutek Inc., Cranston, R.I., has developed a computerized dentists' probe for automatically measuring periodontal disease. The $3,000 device halves examination time and automatically generates patient records and insurance information. </TEXT></DOC>
