Standard andamp; Poor's, a credit rating service, said it was loweringRJR Nabisco's A rating to BB.   Preferred stock and convertible debentures to be issued inconnection with the buyout are expected to receive a B plus rating,Standard andamp; Poor's said.   Standard andamp; Poor's announced it was reassessing RJR Nabisco's debtrating last fall, after the company's managers said they wereconsidering a leveraged buyout of the firm. Management lost abidding war to Kohlberg Kravis, which is in the process of carryingout its own LBO.   A leveraged buyout _ which is accomplished with largely borrowedfunds _ sharply increases the debt load of a company and can raisequestions about its ability to repay its loans.   An A rating _ the third-highest in the Standard andamp; Poor's rankings_ is given to debt that ``has a strong capacity to pay interest andrepay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to theadverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditionsthan debt in higher rated categories.''   The highest Standard andamp; Poor rating is AAA.   A rating of BB is fifth on the Standard andamp; Poor's list, and is thehighest of five grades assigned to debt on which there isspeculation about the issuer's ability to pay interest and repayprincipal. It is followed by B.   ``While such debt will likely have some quality and protectivecharacteristics, these are outweighed by large uncertainties ormajor risk exposures to adverse conditions,'' Standard andamp; Poor's said.</TEXT></DOC>
