The 10 legislators _ five from each side _ ended the talks thatbegan Friday at this village inside the Demilitarized Zone, 35miles north of the South Korean capital of Seoul, withoutindicating there would be another meeting before the Olympics.   One top South Korean official said the talks probably would besuspended until after the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul.   The two Koreas, bitter neighbors since their land was divided atthe end of World War II, refused to budge from their past positionsand instead blamed each other for blocking progress.   The meeting at a North Korean pavilion in the northern sector ofthis truce site ended after two hours when both sides said thetalks were deadlocked. South Korean chief delegate Park Joon-kyuproposed a private meeting with his communist counterpart to try toresolve the problem.   North Korea's delegation withdrew to consider the proposal butdid not respond by the set deadline, and the South Koreandelegation returned to Seoul.   Park said he asked for the private meeting to see if North Koreawas sincere about making headway.   ``If there is no hope, we will postpone the next meeting untilafter the Olympics,'' Park said.   Chon Kum Chol, the chief North Korean delegate, said after themeeting that South Korea's ``attitude is anti-unification. Theirdirection and way of thinking is mistaken.''   Chon held out hope for another meeting but said, ``It alldepends on the southern side. It is the South that should makeconcessions.''   South Korea called for urgent talks to be held in the NorthKorean capital of Pyongyang beginning Aug. 29 to focus solely ontrying to resolve the issue of the Olympics.   ``I must say the Olympic issue is an urgent and importantquestion and both sides agree that the question should be resolvedbefore the end of August,'' Park said.   But Chon, in an opening statement before South Korean made itsproposal, said separate talks on the Olympics were unacceptable. Hesaid North Korea wanted joint discussion of the Olympics and thenon-aggression issue.   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the SouthKorean offer on the Olympics was contrary to the purpose of thetalks.   ``The publication of a joint declaration on non-aggression andthe 24th Olympic Games are important problems that should be solvedtogether at an early date as they are aimed to remove theconfrontation and tension, misunderstanding and distrust betweenthe North and the South,'' the news agency said in a reportmonitored in Tokyo.   Still at issue was a North Korean call for a joint meeting ofnearly 1,000 members of the two sides' legislatures to discuss itsbid to be a co-host of the Olympics and draft a joint declarationon non-aggression.   North Korea also said Monday a formal non-aggression treaty wasnot necessary because, it contends, the two sides are not separatenations. It called for both sides' parliaments to issue adeclaration of non-aggression, which seeks a pullout of 42,000 U.S.troops stationed in South Korea.   North Korea says it will boycott the Olympics if it is notallowed to be a co-host. South Korea fears North Korea could useterrorism to disrupt the Olympics.   Previous, sporadic talks between the two sides since the early1970s failed to make progress. The last talks collapsed in January1986 when North Korea pulled out to protest annual SouthKorean-U.S. military exercises.   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by Soviet and U.S.forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World WarII. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War,which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty beingsigned.</TEXT></DOC>
