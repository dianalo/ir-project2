Amstutz, a formerundersecretary of agriculture, told the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee. ``They are barriers to trade just as sure as importquotas are. ... They are a kind of marriage between industry andgovernment.''   He said the U.S. government is insisting on elimination ofJapanese quotas on beef imports.   ``I think we'll be successful,'' he added.   Amstutz agreed with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who urged U.S.negotiators to push international sales of cigarettes and othertobacco products.   ``This is not the place to make moral judgments,'' Amstutz saidafter the hearing.   The official U.S. campaign against smoking was not discussed atthe session itself. McConnell said moral judgments about practisesin other countries are ``not up to us.''   McConnell estimated that the U.S. share of Japan's cigarettemarket rose from 2 percent to 11 percent in two months after U.S.pressure succeeded in easing restrictions on Japanese imports. Heurged Amstutz to be aggressive in getting restrictions eased inSouth Korea too.   He said that despite the popularity of Turkish tobacco, manyTurkish workers acquired a taste for American tobacco as ``guestworkers'' in West Germany and created a demand for it when theyreturned home. Smoking in Turkey is on the increase and the UnitedStates should take advantage of the opportunity, he said.   Amstutz declined to say what priority he would give to pressingcigarette sales.   ``Everything is first,'' he said.   He explained that at the big international trade discussions inGeneva, Switzerland, known as the ``Uruguay round,'' an effort isbeing made to keep the negotiations away from particular products.   On farm products, the emphasis has been on reducing governmentsubsidies. The Reagan administration has proposed that allgovernment farm subsidies be phased out by the year 2000. Othergovernments have called the goal unrealistic.   The committee is expected to approve Amstutz's nomination nextweek.</TEXT></DOC>
