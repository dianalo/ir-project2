The incoming water is frozen and the liberated heat transferredto a medium used for feeding the heat into a heat pump installation.Freezing is obtained by leading the water into a cold vacuum chamberwhere the ice is continuously let out while the large quantity of developedwater vapour containing the heat, is lead to a condenser working as theevaporating part in the heat pump installation. The water vapour is addedslightly compressed so that it may be condensed at a temperature slightlyabove 0/sup o/ C thus making it possible to design the correspondingdevice in a simple and efficient way. The strong hypopressure may bekept by using a simple condenser of the centrifugal type at the sametime as the heat pump evaporation part may work at a temperature at orclose to 0/sup o/ C - that is a fairly high temperature and yet therewill be no problems with icing and water vapour condensation. Seawaterat 1 - 3/sup o/ C may be used with high efficiency. The claims concernspecifically the water treatment process by freezing it and the processdesign enabling a working temperature of about 0/sup o/ C or slightlyabove. 2 drawings.</TEXT></DOC>
