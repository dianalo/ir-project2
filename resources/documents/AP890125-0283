A Treasury Department spokesman said accounts in commercial banksand credit unions also would be subject to the fees.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, appearing on televisioninterview programs, said plans under review include such fees as 25cents for every $100 in deposits at a thrift and that the premiumswould be used by the federal government to insure the deposits.   At the White House, Bush said, ``That's one option,'' adding thatthe idea had not been presented as a formal recommendation. ``And soI'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but that is one option,''he said.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters,``What you're looking at today is a trial balloon'' that was leakedto see what the reaction would be. ``There will be other trialballoons.''   ``We think it has merit,'' Fitzwater said. ``Let's see how peoplereact.'' He said the idea was first proposed as part of formerPresident Reagan's budget but didn't draw much attention.   White House chief of staff John Sununu spoke warmly about theproposal but insisted that it was ``one of many alternatives stillbeing studied.'' He insisted it would be a ``premium'' and not a taxthat would violated Bush's no-new-taxes pledge.   ``That's just like any other insurance premium _ revenuegeneration for services rendered,'' Brady said on ABC's ``GoodMorning America.'' ``The important thing here is that the federalinsurance on deposits is going to be continued.''   Brady said administration officials have taken the plan to thechairmen of the congressional banking committees, Sen. DonaldRiegle, D-Mich., and Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas.   ``They know how big this program is,'' he said. ``They're givingus plenty of of time to look at the options. They've beenreceptive.''   Arthur Siddon, a spokesman for Brady, said the TreasuryDepartment has not clearly defined the option. He said the feementioned by Brady could be imposed on depositors, or it could bepaid by the institutions as an increase in the insurance premiumthey already pay.   The fee, or premium, would apply to all federally insuredfinancial institutions: banks, Sandamp;Ls and credit unions, he said.Previously, Siddon said the fee might apply only to Sandamp;Ls.   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures deposits in commercial banks, told TheWashington Post that the proposal was ``the reverse toaster theory.Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit,you give them one.''   Brady emphasized the plan has not been adopted by theadministration _ he said it hasn't even been presented to PresidentBush _ and rejected suggestions that it would represent a taxincrease for Sandamp;L customers.   ``What we're doing is to examine all manner of options to pay forthis savings and loan problem we have. It's a big problem. So we'rediscussing all kinds of things _ insurance based premiums, variousdifferent kind of options like that,'' he said on NBC's ``Today''program.   The Post, quoting unnamed sources, said the fee could raise $9billion a year, which would cover interest payments on the $20billion to $30 billion the government will have to raise for severalyears to close Sandamp;Ls and pay off depositors.   Another proposal, under which taxpayers would foot the bill forclosing insolvent institutions, is being offered by the savings andloan industry's largest trade group. The proposal, released Tuesdayby the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, would also cut the feethat thrifts pay for deposit insurance.   The proposal would give the Treasury responsibility for paying toresolve the cases of more than 350 insolvent, but still open, Sandamp;Ls.   Bush, in a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders, said hewould propose substantial revisions next month to Ronald Reagan'sbudget, including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis.   The League proposal called for tougher regulation, but said Sandamp;Lsshould be preserved as an industry separate from commercial banking.The recommendation, which the group plans to present at acongressional hearing Thursday, drew immediate criticism frommembers of the House Banking Committee.   ``It's called, `How to transfer the problems of the Sandamp;L industryto the taxpayers,''' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a member of theHouse Banking Committee.   Parris said the healthy portion of the Sandamp;L industry shouldn't bebled dry, but he said the lobby group ``is just trying to put asugar coating on a pretty bitter pill.''   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said, ``The League proposal represents arealistic recognition that tougher regulation is in order, but anunrealistic expectation that the taxpayers should be stuck with thebill.''   ``The more money the taxpayers are asked to eat, the tougher thereform package should be,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.   The U.S. League plan calls for the creation of a ResolutionCorporation, a new, independent federal agency that would beresponsible for liquidating or selling currently insolvent Sandamp;Ls aswell as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the nextthree years.   It also would take over all of the obligations the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. has acquired in rescuinginstitutions in the past.   The Resolution Corporation would raise money by issuing notes,which would be guaranteed by the Treasury. Any money the corporationgets from selling failed Sandamp;Ls to new investors or from selling theassets would go toward paying off the notes. However, the Treasurywould have to pay most of the bill.   In the meantime, a new, industry-funded FSLIC would be created toinsure the deposits of healthy Sandamp;Ls, which would pay an insurancepremium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks totheir fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
