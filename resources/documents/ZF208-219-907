(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Malpractice is IS?andM;In the eyes of the law, doctors, lawyers and accountants are professionalsand can be sued for malpractice--for failing to act as a professional should.andO;Until recently, IS managers and others who work in computing, such asconsultants, seemed safe from lawsuits alleging any kind of computermalpractice, or failure to follow appropriate computing standards.andM;Such safety may be in jeopardy, however, in the wake of a relatively obscureruling by a U.S.andP;  court in Missouri.andP;  The ruling recognized computermalpractice as the basis for holding third-party IS practitioners liable foracquiring an unworkable computer system for a client.andP;  In upholding theverdict that a St. Louis-based screen printer and apparel manufacturer couldsue a Big Eight accounting firm for faulty computer services on the groudsthat it acted unprofessionally, an appellate court may have opened the doorfor other computer professionals to be held to their similar standards.andM;In Diversified Graphics v. Groves, the jury held consultants from Ernst andamp;Whinney (now Ernst andamp; Young, having merged with Arthur Young andamp; Co.) liable forshirking the Management Advisory Services Practice Standards of the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in their procurement of aturnkey system for Diversified Graphics.andP;  In February, the U.S.andP;  Court ofAppeals for the Eight Circuit agreed, and it let the jury verdict stand.andM;&quot;Diversified is a significant precedent for [establishing] the propositionthat liability can be incurred by any professional performing the types ofservices Eandamp;W offered to perform,&quot; says Peter Sadowski, a partner in TheStolar Partnership of St. Louis, which represented Diversified Graphics.andP;  &quot;Itis equally likely to apply to people doing systems design or programming, notjust systems acquisition.&quot;andM;Someone suing a computer service provider over a minor system error, a majorcomputer crime or the delivery of a system inadequate to his or her needswould like to be able to argue that computer malpractice has occurred, sinceit is often easier to prove malpractice than to prove negligence.andM;Before the Diversified case, leading legal opinion opposed computermalpractice, based in part on the decision in Chatlos Systems, Inc. v.andO;National Cash Register Corp..andP;  In that case, a purchaser of a computer systemsued the vendor (now NCR Corp.) over the functioning of the system.andP;  Althoughthe plaintiff won the case on the basis of breach of contract, the courtrefused to adopt the concept of computer malpractice in its judgment.andM;Standards for ProfessionalismandM;As an accounting firm, Ernst andamp; Whinney, admittedly has officially recognizedprofessional standards to which it can easily be held liable.andP;  Theprofessional codes of ethics set up by the Data Processing ManagementAssociation (DPMA) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) are nottied to any government certification, as are those for the AICPA.andP;  However,the DPMA's membership application includes its code of ethics, whichprospective members must sign.andP;  Prospective ACM members just sign a statementsaying they &quot;subscribe to the purposes of ACM,&quot; which include an extensivecode of professional conduct.andP;  &quot;Our members are expected to practice theirprofession in accordance with the highest accepted standards,&quot; says ACMpresident Bryan Kocher.andM;Both sets of IS codes and the AICPA standards comprise general statementsadvocating principles of ethical professional behavior, such as acting withintegrity, objectivity and independence.andP;  Also, the ACM's code of ethicsspecifically states that its members shall &quot;design and develop systems thatadequately perform the intended functions and shall satisfy an employer's orclient's operational needs&quot; (see table, &quot;How Some of the Standards Compare&quot;).andM;J.T.andP;  Westermeier, a specialist in computer law and the DPMA's 1987Distinguished Information Scientist award winner, advises IS managers thatthe ruling in the Diversified case increases their need to keep up to datewith emerging system technologies and to uphold professional standards toavoid liability.andM;Furthermore, says Westermeier, a partner in the Washington, D.C., office ofFenwick, Davis andamp; West, an IS manager who lists membership in an associationsuch as DPMA or ACM on a resume implies that he or shee has accepted thatassociation's professional standards.andP;  Having done that, a computerprofessional should expect his or her work to be judged by those standards.andO;&quot;Prior to Diversified Graphics, most courts refused to extend professionalliability standards to computer specialists.andP;  Now we've got a federal courtof appeals doing just that,&quot; he says.andM;Some other lawyers who have analyzed the case, however, say it is unclearwhether professional standards for IS managers could be used as a similarbasis for computer malpractice as the AICPA standards were in Diversified.andM;John Hennelly, a partner at Bryan, Cave, McPheeters and McRoberts in St.andO;Louis, which represented Ernst andamp; Whinney, says the case might apply tononaccountants.andP;  But, because it is fact specific, the results in the casedon't necessarily lead to broader conclusions about the liability ofnonaccountants.andM;The Legal Wild CardandM;Another computer lawyer who has studied the case goes further.andP;  Eric Savage,with the Hackensack, N.J.-based law office of Michael Goodman, believes itwas easy for the court in Diversified to find Eandamp;W guilty of malpracticebecause of the accounting organization's highly visible professionalstandards.andP;  Thus, he says, it would be difficult to apply the decision to acase that is adjudicating the liability of a computer professional notemployed by an accounting firm.andM;The wild card in deciding which interpretation of Diversified is more likelyto be realized is the part of the court's ruling that says &quot;the degree ofskill and care that may be required of a professional is a question of factfor a jury.&quot;andP;  Unfortunately, the opinion in Diversified does not providespecific clues as to what measures a court would deem adequate.andM;An experienced litigator knows that once a case goes to a jury, anything mayhappen.andP;  It will be particuarly difficult for a jury to determine, in suitsinvolving charges of computer malpractice or inadequate computer security,what happened, why it happened and who should have kept it from happening.andO;To avoid learning the hard lessons of litigation, IS managers should checkthat their employees are upholding professional computing standards,w hichshould include a level of system security.andP;  The law is in flux now and willbe defined out of the unhappy experiences of future litigants.andM;Michael Scott, director of the independent Los angeles-based Center forComputer Law and author of the textbook Computer Law, says, &quot;Our legal systemhas just begun to deal with the complexities of computer operations, and thequestion of liability when something goes wrong is still far fromresolution.&quot;andM;J.J.andP;
