The Commerce Department wants to approve the computer sale, the Pentagon opposes it, and the State Department is still trying to make up its mind. A State Department spokesman said that the White House will have to intercede to resolve differing interpretations of the existing curbs and settle the dispute.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, testifying before a Senate Banking subcommittee, asserted that the U.S. has no strong reason under existing regulations to deny Digital Equipment Corp. the right to sell three low-level computers to the Iranian press agency and to a Tehran power company. &quot;These computers have technologies that are eight to 10 years old,&quot; he said, adding that they won't be used for &quot;military purposes.&quot;    Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, told the Senate panel that Iran conceivably could obtain similar computers from other countries. &quot;Iran can get them tomorrow morning without any trouble,&quot; he claimed. The Digital Equipment package is valued at $1.4 million.    The U.S. imposed the trade restrictions in 1984, saying they were designed to punish Iran for supporting international terrorism. They generally have been interpreted to forbid shipments of all weapons and munitions to Iran while barring exports of goods with both military and civilian uses -- such as the computers -- only if it can be shown that the ultimate users are the Iranian military.    The Pentagon is urging a harsher interpretation of the restrictions. &quot;It isn't in the best interest of the U.S. to sell computers or anything else to Iran,&quot; a Pentagon spokeswoman said. Stephen Bryen, under secretary of defense for trade security policy, has charged that the equipment could help Iran spread &quot;propaganda against the U.S. all over the Persian Gulf.&quot;    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger will ask the White House or the National Security Council to review the case, a Pentagon spokeswoman said. Besides affecting Iran, a White House endorsement of Mr. Weinberger's position might have an impact on similar anti-terrorism curbs that are being applied in varying degrees to Cuba, Libya, Syria and South Yemen.    Edward Derwinski, undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and technology, told the same Senate Banking subcommittee that the State Department so far hasn't objected to the Commerce Department's position in favor of the computer sale. But other State Department aides conceded that the agency is taking a &quot;second look&quot; at the case.    The State Department says it has no reason to suspect that the computers could be diverted to military uses. But the agency fears that publicity about the shipments -- coming on top of the disclosures that the administration secretly sold Iran arms to win release of American hostages in Lebanon -- would further undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts to persuade other countries to deny Iran weapons and other sensitive goods.    West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and South Korea are already cooperating with &quot;Operation Stanch,&quot; as the effort is called, a State Department spokesman reported. And Secretary of State George Shultz, during his recent visit to Beijing, asked Chinese authorities to refrain from selling arms to the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime. </TEXT></DOC>
