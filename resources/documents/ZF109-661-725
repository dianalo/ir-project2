 Once the basis of AI in the 1970s and 1980s and still theonly means of developing machine intelligence, &quot;research&quot; is now a word thatmost companies won't say out loud.andM;As the deployment of application (especially in expert-system areas) becamemore important than fiddling around with theoretical possibilities fordeveloping applications, research began to be associated with a &quot;playpen&quot;mentality.andP;  Organizations equated pure research with little kids content tohang out in the playpen with all their toys, as long as they get new onesregularly.andP;  They have no intention of outgrowing, the playpen, takingresponsibility for their actions, or producing anything more substantial thanthe occasional sandcastle.andM;This transformation from glory to gutter took about four years, roughlycoinciding with the end of the 1980s.andP;  But if research is abansoned due toconcern for tangible results, where will the next generation of AI technologyand technical improvements come from?andM;Any field continues to need research, even if that research moves to thesidelines, allowing time for the field and its related technology to becomeaccepted by the real world.andP;  Users and user organizations need time to getacclimated to technology, time to use it, and time to find viable areas forapplication.andP;  During this process, research goes into a corner and takes abreather from the public eye, but it still keeps working.andP;  So what isresearch doing that we haven't yet seen in the commercial sector?andP;  Read on.andM;Much research throughout the world is largely an extension of the conceptsand principles that have already been put into practice in commercialproducts such as Nexpert, KEE (and now Kappa), ART, KES, KBMS, ADS, and allthe other acronym-based tools on the market.andP;  These packages featuremethodologies such as inheritance, connectionism, knowledge representationand knowledge uncertainty, as well as more esoteric concerns such ascausality and expressiveness.andP;  Not surprisingly, work in these areas ispursued by commercial vendors (such as IntelliCorp, IBM, Bell Atlantic, andso on), as well as the established bastions of AI research such as StanfordUniversity, MIT, Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and the University ofEdinburgh.andP;  This fact also holds true for work in natural language and voicerecognition.andP;  (Interestingly, many of these organizations are not subscribesto neural-net technology.)andM;But the really different research, the work that hasn't yet made it to thecommercial sector, is taking place in three primary areas: machine learning,parallel or distributed processing of AI, and intelligent robots.andP;  The lattertechnology has always been a dream of AI researchers, and there seems to berenewed interest in the possibilities that such primeval R2D2s may hold.andP;  Butmore on this later.andM;THE LEARNING MACHINEandM;Machine learning has long been a bugaboo of all parties interested in AI.andO;Can a machine truly learn, or is its &quot;growth&quot; a function of programmingalone?andP;  This debate takes into consideration self-modifying or self-adaptingprograms, plus those that can accept input from sensor (not sensory) data tocreate new rules and paradigms.andP;  Two frequently used concepts that havearisen from this area of research are explanation- and situation-basedlearning, or EBL and SBL.andM;EBL is a form of machine intelligence that involves the ability to &quot;learn&quot;from specific examples and extrapolate them through domain-specificconstraints and paradigms.andP;  Thus, a few examples can be used as a basis forquicker learning curves.andP;  In SBL, more examples are needed from which tolearn, but the machine doesn't have to rely on specific domain constraintsand theories.andP;  SBL tends to focus on larger world views (almost anexperiential approach) while EBL stresses concentration on the particulars ofan environment (more of a full niche view).andM;Work in this area is dispersed throughout commercial and academis arenas,with agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSFe and NASA involved atall levels.andP;  The University of Southern Californi (USC) is active in machinelearning, employing a learning mechanism called &quot;chunking.&quot;andP;  So is GTELaboratories, which has presented papers on its CITRE decision-tree learningsystems.andM;The Microelectric and Computer Technology Corp. (MCC) is working on atechnique called complementary discrimination learning, which holds that bothdiscrimination and generalization can be achieved by exposing the machine toconcepts in training sessions.andP;  Depending on the goal to be achieved, thesystem can dissect the training sessions into the appropriate generalizationsand discriminations as necessary.andM;Carnegie-Mellon University is still a leader in this area of AI, whereHiroaki Kiatano is working on using genetic algorithms for learning, and OrenEtsioni (in conjunction with ATandamp;T) is investigating EBL systems.andP;  Much ofCMU's work is also supported by agencies such as DARPA, which is funding amachine problem-solving project called ALPINE, overseen by Craig Knoblock.andM;Of course, the arguments in this area of research are ongoing, and often itseems that a jihad on the order of the old LISP vs.andP;  PROLOG debates isimminent.andP;  Concerns over ideological areas such as feature construction,similarity-based classifications, generalization and discrimination, andsearch-control knowledge have the same importance now to the researchcommunity that forward and backward chaining had nearly a decade ago.andM;PARALLEL UNIVERSEandM;The idea of getting a machine to behave in a truly intelligent fashion hasalways raised the question of how to mimic the brain and the apparentlyparallel nature of our thinking processes.andP;  This goal is certainly the basisof much of the neural-network community's pursuits, and more and more of thetraditional AI researchers are beginning to look at the benefits of applyingmassively parallel architectures to expert systems and knowledge bases (andagain, to a smaller degree, voice and natural language).andM;A great deal of this new research was spawned by Thinking Machines, due toits close ties with MIT.andP;  Obviously, the creation of its 64,000 processorConnection Machine means that Thinking Machines' bread is buttered on theside of massive parallelism, but a number of organizations, including theNSF, are reseraching the benefits of expanding beyond the essentiallyworkstation-and PC-based limits of AI.andP;  (The machine's creator,  DannyHillis, is one of the foremost proponents of this approach.)andP;  The concernsare that as intelligent systems get larger and larger, not only will theamount of memory space they occupy increase, but the number of pertinentfacts, concepts, rules, and related flotsam that must be analyzed will aswell, perhaps to unmanageable proportions for existing serial machines.andM;If machines are to access and process data intelligently, the tasknecessitates near real-time speed (in many instances) and simultaneousprocessing of both related and disparate information; in other words, the waywe perceive the execution of human thought.andP;  And certainly, larger systemscould herald &quot;smarter&quot; applications.andM;However, this particular area of research is still at the mercy of economics,the great god of commerce.andP;  The purchase of a Connection Machine, iPSC,Butterfly, or similar machine can cost a user organization anywhere from$250,000 to just under $10 million.andP;  Clearly, a concern for dollars casts ashadow over the development of massively parallel AI applications thatobscures machine-intelligence benefits.andP;  As the cost for parallelism comesdown, though, you should expect to see parallel knowledge systems begin toenter the mainstream.andP;  For now, the field is relegated to a strictly researchendeavor, with the exception of a tiny handful of corporations that canjustify the expense (such as Dow Jones).andM;METALHEADSandM;Finally, that ever-elusive search to create the first intelligent robot notconfined to the cinema remains one of the most research-intensive areas ofAI, though none of its results have ever seen the light of day.andP;  Outside ofultra-high-tech companies with defense contracts such as Odetics and MartinMarietta, intelligent robot research is limited to the universities that havealways been crucial to basic AI research.andP;  Japan, too, is spending a greatdeal of its technology resources on this area, more so than on knowledgesystems or natural language.andP;  Godzilla-sized corporations such as NEC,Mistubishi, and members of ICOT are outspending the rest of the world onbasic robotic research.andM;Encompassing such diverse fields as computer vision, mobile navigation,decision-making, pattern recognition, and signal processing, these machineswill utilize several technology components that thus far have been mutuallyisolated.andP;  While everyone can envision how these things should all worktogether (six decades of science fiction have already laid that out for us),putting them into practice in a single cohesive unit poses problems ofcomputing power that initially appear insurmountable.andP;  Thus, differentresearchers are chipping away of different parts of the problem.andM;For example, Brown University--with funding from DARPA, the NSF, and IBM--isworking on a mobile robot named Huey.andP;  The primary area of research isdesigning a control system that can address the uncertainty arising in anunknown or partially unknown environment, specifically when relying on noisyor ambiguous sensor data to acquire knowledge about that environment.andP;  USCand the University of Michigan are working on robots that react tointerruptions in their environment based on Soar, an increasingly popularsystem designed a few years ago for machine-problem solving and execution(the Soar methodology also appears in machine learning).andP;  The University ofToronto, which is beginning to make substantial gains in AI research, boastsrobot investigation under the direction of Hector Levesque, a fellow of theCanadian Institute for Advanced Research.andM;While most robot tests of intelligence involve traditional block-stacking andobstacle-course maneuvers, one research project at the University ofRochester is notable for its sense of the unique.andP;  The Rochester Robot is amobile robot designed to select objects based primarily on color, with ade-emphasis on shape, which can change if packaging is damaged or altered.andO;The project is headed by Michael Swain, who created the color-recognitionsystem for the robot.andP;  The university is looking at applying such a robot inenvironments like grocery stores, where it could recognize the fruit orvegetable or other foodstuff placed in front of it, and then associate aprice with that object and ring it up automatically.andP;  The robot's first testis a formidable one: distinguishing between boxes of Frosted Flakes andCrunch Berries.andM;This research is in such limted-use environments that the first intelligentmobile machines will probably appear soon.andP;  Add machine learning to suchsystems, along with massively parallel processing, and this intelligent robotwill probably be smart enough to pass both the Frosted Flakes and CrunchBerries and head straight for the Cocoa Puffs.andM;FIRST THINGS FIRSTandM;According to Rochester's Randall Nelson, though, robots are still pretty lowon the food chain of intelligence: &quot;We say bugs aren't smart, but we're stilltrying to imitate their behavior.andP;  It's going to take a lot moreinvestigation of lower life forms to understand how higher ones undertaketheir endeavors.andP;  Until we understand simple animal behavior, we can't evenbegin to understand how a musician writes a symphony.&quot;andM;Hot On the Expert-SystemandM;TrailandM;It seemed so simple when we talked about it.andP;  &quot;Call up a bunch of places andfind out what kind of expert systems or neural networks they're using,&quot; AlanZeichick, our fearless editor, said.andP;  &quot;Look for science stuff--you know,aeronautics and those kinds of places.andP;  Let's run a companion piece withHarvey's.andP;  He'll do research, you'll do in practice.&quot;andP;  So, armed with thenames of various scientific and research organizations, I churned through theRolodex.andM;First I turned up a pipe and steel company that used a robotic arm to solderwelds.andP;  This was not just any old soldering robot, this robot could think, orso said my research from NASA Tech Briefs.andP;  I couldn't find the pipe andsteel company in the phone book, so I called the company that developed thesoftware.andP;  They were very helpful.andP;  I was transferred from one engineer toanother vice president to another program developer to another publicrelations specialist before we discovered that I had the wrong company.andP;  &quot;Oh,you don't want Technological Innovations Incorporated, you want TechnologicalInnovations Limited.&quot;andP;  Or something like that.andP;  It turned out that &quot;Limited&quot;had been sold to a Houston company.andP;  I called Houston.andM;Houston was very helpful.andP;  They had bought Limited five or six years ago butthey didn't make that software for the robot anymore.andP;  In fact, they didn'tdo anything with expert systems or neural networks any more.andP;  Of course, theyknew how, they just didn't want to.andP;  They thought the pipe and steel companyhad gone out of business.andP;  &quot;Have you read Ed Feigenbaum's book?&quot; they asked.andO;&quot;He talks a lot about expert systems.andP;  DuPont uses them.&quot;andM;Well, I had read Ed Feigenbaum's book, and he does talk about expert systems.andO;But Alan and I had thought we would cover smaller companies than DuPont andwhat they might be using in the way of artificial intelligence.andP;  I decided tohold off on calling DuPont.andM;Instead, I called Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, thinking that they mightknow of some real-world spinoffs of research they had done.andP;  They were veryhelpful.andP;  They have some nifty projects under way, including a telescope withcomputer chips that are modeled on the visual principles of a frog's retina.andO;But they couldn't steer me to any real-world applications.andM;Then I called several professors.andP;  They were very helpful.andP;  &quot;Lots ofcompanies use them,&quot; the man at Berkeley said.andP;  &quot;American Express, IBM.andO;DuPont uses a lot.andP;  Have you read Ed Feigenbaum's book?&quot;andM;Next on my list was an American aerospace company.andP;  The man there was veryhelpful.andP;  &quot;I see exactly what you need,&quot; he said, and I sighed with relief.andO;&quot;I'll talk to these guys and call you back in a few days.&quot;andP;  In a week when hehadn't called, I called him.andP;  He was out of town.andP;  I didn't want to think hewas job hunting because nobody in this company used expert systems.andP;  I calledagain.andP;  Still gone.andP;  Called again.andP;  Still gone.andM;So I called a Canadian aerospace company.andP;  They were very helpful.andP;  Thiscompany builds space stations.andP;  They have engineers, they have scientists,they have computer programmers.andP;  They have space platforms, they have roboticarms, they have gizmos galore.andP;  What they don't have is expert systems.andP;  Theyknow what they are, of course, but they aren't really applicable in thisparticular circumstance.andP;  Have I read Ed Feigenbaum's book?andM;I had one more trick up my sleeve.andP;  I called a former AI EXPERT author whom Ithought would have oodles of ideas.andP;  His first idea was DuPont.andP;  Ipersevered.andP;  He had two other ideas, good ones, but by then Alan and Ithought we'd get more mileage out of what there wasn't in practice than whatthere was.andM;With any luck, Ed Feigenbaum will write another book soon.andP;  Or maybe someoneat DuPont will.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
