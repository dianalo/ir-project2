The main purpose of this study is to make a good comparisonbetween these two modes of emplacement in this region. Homogeneous andnonhomogeneous strata under isothermal or transient temperature conditionscases were considered in the analyses. Furthermore, various pillar widthsfor the vertical mode emplacement were also taken into consideration.Only spent fuel (SF) waste was considered in this study. Finite elementmethod was used throughout the analyses. The thermal responses were evaluatedusing SPECTROM-41 while the thermomechanical responses were calculatedusing SPECTROM-32. Thermal and thermomechanical comparisons between thetwo modes of emplacement for various cases were presented in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
