Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX ECO </IN><TEXT>   &quot;Late-cycle economy.&quot;    Those warning words are cropping up more and more frequently in the hundreds of research reports that flow out of Wall Street each week. The phrase may be less scary than &quot;imminent recession,&quot; but many investors figure the terms are synonymous.    Yet, the last phase of an economic cycle can go on for a long time before the inevitable recession. So it's useful to try to judge just where we are in the cycle and what equity investors should expect next.    To do that, &quot;Just use common sense,&quot; advises Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. Among other things, he suggests investors simply consider how long the current expansion has lasted: At 70 months, it's the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history.    Beyond that, he says, there are classic symptoms of a late-cycle economy: increases in factory utilization, a declining unemployment rate, shortages of some raw materials and rising prices. Taken together those factors can create rising inflation, prompting a Federal Reserve response. The result? Higher interest rates that squeeze the overheating economy and may well push it into a cycle-ending recession.    While Mr. Johnson says a recession still isn't likely for at least two to four quarters, he's urging caution. &quot;It's extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly where you are in the cycle, and that's what makes it so hazardous to investors,&quot; he says. He suggests that investors start hunkering down now for the long haul. His recommended portfolio: 50% bonds, 35% stocks and 15% cash. The stock recommendations range toward the classic defensive hedges, such as drugs and utilities, but include small companies with good growth records and niches in their markets.    That's because exactly which stocks an investor holds can be crucial in a recession. &quot;It's hard to duck a recession if it's IBM or some other large-capitalization issue, but you can often find smaller companies, even in cyclical industries, that are less affected,&quot; he says.    Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, agrees that this is a particularly worrisome time for investors. He thinks the Fed's recent tightening moves will begin to show results soon, posing a dilemma for investors.    &quot;We're going to run into a period in the fall when there probably will be more visible patches of economic slowing,&quot; he says. &quot;The stock market dilemma will be whether the slowing will be a ratcheting down of the economy to a sustainable growth rate or a recession in the making.&quot;    Given the amounts of cash available, Mr. Miller expects evidence of a slowing economy to trigger a stock market rally. But he warns that the savvy investor had best keep on eye on what's happening in the world economy to get a feel for where the U.S. economy is heading.    &quot;To continue to grow at a slower rate we have to be able to sustain export strength,&quot; he says. &quot;That will depend in part on the health and vigor of economies abroad.&quot; Mr. Miller's own view is that any weakening in the U.S. economy will be a prelude to a recession. &quot;There's no question it's going to be a tricky, difficult time,&quot; he says.    Andrew Riley, portfolio strategist at Yamaichi International America, suggests that the Fed has room to boost interest rates without pushing the economy into recession. He believes memories of last October remain strong enough that, at the first sign of weakness in the economy, the Fed will ease rates.    Yet Mr. Riley is no bull. &quot;We're a year into a bear market and I don't see where the upside would be coming from,&quot; he says. Consequently, he's counseling clients to take a conservative stance. &quot;Stay away from late-cycle stocks&quot; such as steel, auto and chemical issues, he warns. &quot;Most of them are lousy companies anyway. Use weakness to go back to the companies you'd like to own forever.&quot;    Some of his picks? Digital Equipment, International Business Machines and Wal-Mart Stores.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Investors pushed stock prices lower in lethargic trading.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 11.03 points to close at 2016.00, following a drop of about 15 points during the final half hour that market observers tied to trading inspired by expiration of stock options. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was just 122.4 million shares. Advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 794-624. For the week the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 21.52.    The most active issues were two utilities that were the target of dividend capture strategies. Kansas City Power andamp; Light gained 5/8 to 29 5/8 on volume of 4.5 million shares, and Florida Power andamp; Light was up 1/4 to 30 on volume of 3.7 million shares.

Himont's chairman told Dow Jones that the company is &quot;having an incredible year&quot; and &quot;substantially&quot; exceeded analysts' expectations that it would earn $1.40 a share in the third quarter ended July 31. A year earlier the company earned $53 million, or 82 cents a share.    Technology stocks were the big losers.
