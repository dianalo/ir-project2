FBI Director William Sessions told a news conference that the &quot;preliminary phase&quot; of the investigation -- focusing on laws dealing with fraud, malicious mischief and unauthorized access to computer information -- is to be finished by Thanksgiving. &quot;Those statutes are intricate,&quot; Mr. Sessions said, and investigators &quot;need to be absolutely thorough&quot; in establishing federal jurisdiction and in deciding if prosecution is warranted.    After that, the bureau could expand its inquiry, recommend that the Justice Department seek criminal charges or move to close the case without further investigation.    Law-enforcement officials said they haven't interviewed Robert T. Morris, the 23-year-old Cornell University computer whiz who has admitted to friends that he created the virus but maintained that he didn't intend to cause any damage. Investigators must determine, among other things, whether federal laws cover such activities and what Mr. Morris's motivation was when he created the computer program that apparently went out of control. </TEXT></DOC>
