A one-day national strike to protest the economic policy wasplanned today by the Communist-run General Confederation ofPeruvian Workers, the nation's most powerful labor organization.   Violence surged on the eve of the strike. A student was shot andkilled at a campus protest and suspected leftist guerrillas burneda city bus.   The joint military command on Wednesday confirmed theresignation of Gen. Victor Raul Silva, commander of army operationsat Peru's disputed border with Ecuador, but did not comment further.   An army general, speaking on condition his name not be used,told The Associated Press that Silva was made to resign because hewarned support for a coup was growing within military circles. Thegeneral denied a coup was being planned and said Silva's chargesbrought dishonor to the armed forces.   La Republica, a Lima daily linked to Peru's moderate left,charged Wednesday in an unattributed report that Silva's discussionof a coup forced the military to abort a takeover Saturday.   Silva served for two years as military aide to Garcia, who begana five-year term in July 1985.   A growing economic crisis in Peru has produced widespread rumorsof a pending military takeover, but both government and militaryspokesmen have publicly dismissed those rumors.   The powerful military has toppled three democratically electedgovernments since 1948. It last ruled from 1968 to 1980.   Harsh austerity measures imposed by the center-left Garciagovernment in early September to slow inflation, growing at arecord annual rate of nearly 1,000 percent, have led to protests.   Police said an anthropology student was shot in the head at SanMarcos University in Lima during a clash Wednesday between riotpolice and about 150 students protesting the austerity measures.   The police denied charges by University Rector Jorge Campos Reythat officers fired the bullet, saying instead that the gunshotscame from inside the campus grounds.   About 35 students were arrested in the clash, police said.   In the other incident, four hooded young men armed withsubmachine guns and revolvers burned a bus after ordering itsdriver and 35 passengers off, police said.   Passengers said the assailants identified themselves as membersof the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, and warned theywould step up violence Thursday in support of the strike.   The incident occurred on the Pan American Highway on Lima'snorthern outskirts.</TEXT></DOC>
