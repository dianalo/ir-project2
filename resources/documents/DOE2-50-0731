Though aid previously authorized and in thepipeline will continue to flow for some time, new economic assistanceand military sales credits cannot be granted without further legislation,despite Pakistan's key role in supporting antigovernment Afghan guerrillas.The reason for the cutoff is that Pakistan has continued to be in violationof US restrictions on foreign aid to nations that are actively developingnuclear weapons. Congress had given the President the authority to waivesome of those restrictions on grounds of US national interest. The situationfacing Congress regarding aid to Pakistan and nuclear nonproliferationpresents an extraordinarily rich and fascinating illustration of thedilemmas involved in legislating in this field. The Pakistani case alsopresents, more than any other current case, the greatest near-term riskof actual proliferation. This article, therefore, discusses the Pakistanproliferation problem and how the US Congress has attempted to deal withit. It explains the existing US laws on this subject, comments on pendingnew legislation relating to Pakistan, and assesses prospects for progresstoward mutual restraint by India and Pakistan.</TEXT></DOC>
