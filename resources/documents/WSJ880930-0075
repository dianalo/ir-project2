The provision, however, will be offset partially by a $25 million, or 41-cent-a-share, gain from the disposition of assets. In the 1987 third quarter, Combustion earned $15.3 million, or 40 cents a share. Sales totaled $791.2 million.    The company has been developing a variety of alternative energy sources for several years, including municipal waste-to-energy plants. But costs for the first-time plants have exceeded estimates, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
