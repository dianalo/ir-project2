Officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and theColorado Department of Health said Wednesday that the closure wouldprompt them to take a closer look at the plant operator's plans toremove pollution there.   ``The question is one of the competence of the peopleinvolved,'' said Mike Sattler of the health department.   Rockwell International Corp. operates the plant for the U.S.Department of Energy.   ``The shutdown and ongoing cleanup operations are separateissues, but our visibility may increase as a result of it,'' saidEPA's Nat Miullo. ``We may have more frequent inspections of theplant. We have to be more visible.''   State officials and the EPA are studying 107 polluted sites atthe plant and designing plans to clean them. Rocky Flats officialsare providing most of the information about the sites andrecommending cleanup operations.   The area of most immediate concern is known as the 881 hillside,where chemical pollution has tainted groundwater and threatensWoman Creek.   DOE officials in Washington on Saturday stopped operations inBuilding 771, where Rockwell manufactures triggers for the nuclearweapons and recovers plutonium from contaminated materials and oldparts.   The shutdown resulted from an incident earlier this year whenthree men went into a restricted area without respirators. Theincident posed no health threat to the men, DOE officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
