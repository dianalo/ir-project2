the consultant said.andP;  Hisboss smiled.andP;  My boss smiled.andP;  We all smiled.andP;  &quot;I don't know exactly whatwe're going to do with this, but I know we can do something good.andP;  Bill,we've got 132 hours left over in these fellows' work assignment.andP;  You andMike (Mike Nelson, the consultant) take those hours and see what you can do.&quot;andO;Hypertext had just put its nose under the agency's tent.andP;  I was as happy as aHusky who's been appointed lead dog for the Iditarod sled race.andM;One floor below our building's underground parking garage the U.S.andO;Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) opened a small office to carry out theagency's Congressional mandate to protect our nation from LUST (leakingunderground storage tanks, not the other kind).andP;  Congress had charged the EPAto regulate about two million underground storage tanks in about 750,000different sites (gas stations, rental agencies, and so on) nationwide.andO;Prevent the tanks from leaking, remedy the harm already caused by currentleaks, and ensure that every underground tank owner can afford to compensatefor damages their leak cause.andP;  According to Congress, we would writeregulations to accomplish these goals.andM;Tank owners and operators would have to understand our regulations to complywith them, but gas pumping does not occur in a high-technology setting.andP;  Inour regulatory community, a business sector supplies, services, and advisestank owners and operators; state and local agencies also work with tankowners and operators.andP;  The EPA could get the word out to tank owners andoperators via the service businesses and local agencies.andP;  We could expectthem to have PCs, but not to be aware of a computer technology as esoteric ashypertext was two years ago.andP;  These potential users would have to seehypertext at work in the &quot;real world&quot; before considering it--they'dexperienced computer-consultant promises before.andM;Our decision to develop REg-In-A-Box was not the product of a formal needsasessment in which a clearly-identified cluster of users asked us to put ourregulations into hypertext.andP;  Instead, we acted on insight into our customers'needs, and the opportunity that hypertext's sudden appearance afforded us.andM;REGULATION DEVELOPMENTandM;How could we make regulations better understood?andP;  Three basic characteristicsmake most government regulations difficult to understand:andM;* Regulations are written in legal and technical language, a style notordinarily used by the people who are to comply with them.andM;* Regulations have no page-number index of key words or phrases to aid you infinding references to a particular topic.andM;* Regulations typically have many corss-references between different parts ofthe regulation or to other regulations, which must be understood tocomprehend the meaing of the sentence or paragrah you are reading.andM;Persistent institutional forces create these barriers to understanding.andP;  Thelegal and technical language is a product of compromises between technicaland legal players in the committee process when regulations are drafted.andO;Thus, our ability to clarify our regulation had very practical limits.andM;To prepare a good index you must understand both the substance of your textand the user's vocabulary and thought processes; then you must make thecorrect hypertext links for all the words or phrases in your index list.andO;This task is labor-intensive because regulations are sequentially publishedin at least two formats: the Federal Register and the Code of FederalRegulations.andM;The cross-references in regulatory language link the topic to otherregulations, weaving a web of meaning that is similar to unautomatedhypertext.andP;  Though they increase the difficulty of understanding regulations,cross-references add crucial substantive knowledge.andM;The problem of searching legal texts (regulations, statutes, and so on) hasbeen addressed by text search and retrieval services such as Lexis and Nexis.andO;These services collect text and give their subscribers logically powerfulsearch and retrieval tools.andP;  However, the users have to use their ownunderstanding in this process to judge what to search for and how to framethe search.andP;  When the text is found the users are left on their own tointerpret its meaning.andM;Our development of Reg-In-A-Box was necessarily paced to the formal procedureof developing and publishing a Federal regulation.andP;  My analysis of the EPAregulation-development process estimated our regulation would take about twoand a half years to develop if things went smoothly.andP;  As an insider in thisprocess I would have full access to the people and the text involved.andP;  But myopportunity to show software containing that text to outsiders would belimited after public comment on the rule closed.andP;  The final-rule text wouldchange until the very last minute the agency sent it to the Federal Register.andM;Between stages of this race we would develop Reg-In-A-Box's hypertexttechniques.andP;  When regulatory text was officially published we were off on along sprint to cram it into our hypertext formats.andP;  Although I could get theASCII text files our office produced, it still had to be checked to reflectexactly the punctuation and numbering of the actual Federal Registerpublication.andP;  We would annotate, not correct, any errors in the publishedtext with a hypertext window.andM;THE STARTING LINEandM;My first glance at the simple Guide for Macintosh demo the consultant showedus revealed potential solutions for these barriers to understanding.andP;  We setout to develop a proof-of-concept prototype of our regulations in hypertext.andO;If this prototype seemed promising, we would develop and beta-test anotherprototype using the text of the regulations ouroffice would propose forpublic comment in the Federal Register in Fall 1988.andP;  If the beta-testresults indicated our hypertext application was promising, we would produce ahypertext version of the final regulations as soon as possible after theirpublication in the Federal Register.andM;Using OWL's Guide for Macintosh we rapid-prototyped the basic features andfunctions of our application.andP;  We knew roughly what we wanted to do, but wedid not know exactly how the software would let us do it.andP;  Two of thebarriers--plain English and cross-references--were easy to solve in ourproof-of-concept prototype.andP;  Each subsection would have a hypertext &quot;button&quot;on it.andP;  When the reader pressed the button, the plain-English translation forthe subsection would pop-up on the screen.andP;  Cross-references were equallyeasy to implement: all we had to do was make the connections the lawyers hadinserted in the text of the regulation.andP;  (Though conceptually simple, thesetasks later posed daunting nontechnical difficulties as we worked on theproduct's final version.)andM;At this proof-of-concept stage the tough problem was how our users could findthe particular text in the regulation they wanted.andP;  The available shells hadno search command that would search across all the nodes of a hypertextnetwork in a single file.andP;  So I telephoned the vendors of the hypertextshells we were testing to find out when the required search function would bein their software.andM;I discovered that hypertext-shell developers have a mythical fear ofhypertext users getting lost and confused if left to browse text independentof the web of connections established by the hypertext author.andP;  Most vendorswanted to know why anyone would ever want to perform a general search of ahypertext application to begin with.andP;  &quot;Because there's no index at the backof the book,&quot; I said unpersuasively.andP;  They didn't think I really needed astring-search function; and if given one, they were convinced I would justget myself in trouble with it.andM;LESS THAN MEETS THE EYEandM;The eye-catching drawing of a tank with individual parts linked to regulatorytext the consultant presented in his pitch closed the sale.andP;  Ironically, welearned early in prototyping that this feature would not work as an accessmechanism because of its linkage limitations.andP;  We could make only onehypertext link from each active feature on the tank graphic to one section oftext in the regulation.andP;  We understood this limitation in the abstract, butdid not comprehend its practical importance until we linked draft-text of theregulation to a tank drawing.andP;  References to a single part of the tank are inmultiple parts of the regulation.andM;A tank is much simpler visually than words about the tank.andP;  For example, asacrificial anode is a chunk of zinc bolted to the end of the tank.andP;  Thedetail in the drawing of that chunk of zinc is limited, because you mightdestroy the graphic quality that makes it recognizable.andP;  At its most complex,the graphic is much simpler than the words related to it.andP;  In practicalhypertext, this difference significantly restricts the usefulness of graphics(which are wonderfully communicative) to access complex bodies of text.andM;Why not develop a list of key words and phrases similar to a book index?andP;  Wewould connect each listed word or phrase to a hypertext button linked to theparticular text where it would be found.andP;  Again we were limited to one linkper hypertext button, but we needed multiple links from each button to makethe idea workable.andP;  We could construct a conventional keyword list and placedifferently numbered hypertext buttons after each such entry, just like thepage numbers that trail the keyword in a hardcopy index.andM;As we drafted the keyword list we realized the complexity and massive effortthat would be required.andP;  How should &quot;cathodic protection&quot; be listed?andP;  As&quot;cathodic protection&quot; (which assumes the user knows it's a type of corrosionprotection); as &quot;corrosion protection&quot;; or both?andP;  And if we put all thereferences to different types of corrosion protection under the same heading,wouldn't the user be better off looking at the section headings in the tableof contents rather than using this index?andM;Assuming we could compile such a list, we would still have to make manyhypertext links, and they would have to be maintained later if the regulationchanged.andP;  This combination of substantive, organizational, and technicalconsiderations made the keyword approach too onerous to be acceptable.andM;Confident that we would be able to solve this problem somehow, I brought ourproof-of-concept prototype to my boss.andP;  I got the commitment and the money todevelop and beta-test a complete version, which would use a proposedregulation to be published in the Federal Register in several months.andP;  Ourdevelopment dogsled had completed the first stage of the race.andM;Technical and strategic needs determined software selection.andP;  As we developedour proof-of-concept prototype, our product distribution and support strategyalso emerged.andP;  Distribution and support considerations would play asimportant a role in selection of the software shell as our technicalrequirements.andM;Technically our development and delivery shell needed to:andM;* Be easy for developers to learn and useandM;* Have a run-time module and licensing terms enabling our users to copy theapplication legallyandM;* Have a string-search command that would function across different hypertextnodes in the same fileandM;* Run in a mouseless, monochrome, XT-level environmentandM;* Have capability to access external programs so third parties could enhanceour hypertext kernel with their own value-added proprietary software (makingthe application support itself fiscally).andM;We decided to design and position Reg-In-A-Box to encourage private-sectorvendors to add their own proprietary value-added features and remarket it atwhatever price they chose.andP;  We would create a small supply of ourReg-In-A-Box version scoped narrowly and made as open to third-partyenhancement as possible.andP;  We would send copies to EPA's 10 regional officesand to each state.andP;  And we would keep a list of interested people and sendthem a copy when the application was ready.andP;  The application's availabilitywould be publicized discreetly in our agency newsletters.andM;GIVE-AWAY LICENSEandM;Our strategy positioned Reg-In-A-Box as a noncopy-protected, give-away item.andO;We wanted to acquaint the maximum number of people with our regulations andthe hypertext version.andP;  &quot;If you like it, make copies for your friends.andP;  Ifyou don't like it, make copies for your enemies,&quot; I told callers who inquiredabout its cost and availability.andP;  However, to deliver a copyable, read-onlyversion of our application we needed a development and delivery shell thatprovided this legally, as well as technologically.andM;OWL International, whose Guide for the Macintosh was the vehicle for ourproof-of-concept prototype, announced a PC version of the shell and offeredto reproduce and distribute our application for us.andP;  After several months ofmeetings with OWL representatives, we had not reached an agreement.andP;  Idecided to turn the matter over to one of our consulting firms.andO;Unfortunately, the consultants did not solve the problem either.andP;  Meanwhile,the next stage of the race had begun: our proposed regulations had beenformally published in the Federal Register.andP;  Now published regulatory textwaited to be put into hypertext.andM;We didn't have a PC version of our application with the license termsReg-In-A-Box required.andP;  If we beta-tested a very tightly licensed product itwould signal a shift in our strategy.andP;  It appeared that few of our potentialusers had Macintoshes and most of those with PCs lacked the EGA board,monitor, and mouse that Guide for the PC requires.andP;  Although Guide had abeautiful Xerox/PARC-type developer interface ideal for our application'sdevelopment capability, I concluded that Guide was legally and technicallyunsuitable for our project.andM;To cover the possibility we might not find any PC-compatible deliverysoftware, I decided to continue developing a Macintosh version.andP;  However,Apple's HyperCard emerged and Mike Nelson was eager to try it out.andP;  HyperCardis a more powerful product than Guide for Macintosh, and Apple's licensingpolicy for HyperCard applications was stable and clear.andP;  (After Reg-In-A-Boxwas completed, I concluded that the Hypercard application environment'scomplexity makes it less cost-effective for this application than BlackMagic.)andM;BACK TO THE SOFTWARE SHELFandM;I dug out my copy of KnowledgePro and scrutinized the terms of theirlicensing agreement.andP;  Yes, the run-time module is bundled with the shell, andyes, you can make as many copies of your application as you want with noadditional licensing fees.andP;  It runs quite happily in a monochrome XT systemand can access external programs.andM;But it did not have an adequate string-search capability.andP;  Despite thisdeficiency, I secluded myself with KnowledgePro and quickly prototyped ourapplication's basic functions.andP;  It looked promising, so I loaned thehypertext contractor my KnowledgePro software and manual to try out forhimself.andP;  He spent several days with it and agreed that KnowledgePro was ourbest bet.andM;Developing expert systems in a setting where the knowledge base is changingand consensus hasn't been established can be hazardous.andP;  These conditions aremore often the case than not in regulation; my job is to bring applicationsto fruition in such unsettled conditions.andP;  Changes in the knowledge domainand the absence of a consensus enhance the importance and value of capturingand conveying knowledge in hypertext and expert-system applications.andP;  Thefaster and easier this can be done, the more valuable the application.andO;Anything associated with the software that may add development timejeopardizes the value of knowledge which has a relatively short shelf life.andM;When our time ran out on OWL talks I decided to beta-test in KnowledgePro.andO;Mike Nelson and I divided the regulation text, each taking a half of the textto develop the application using KnowledgePro.andP;  In one week we would put ourtwo halves together and see how close we were to being ready for betatesting.andP;  We emerged from our respective offices somewhat dazed a week later.andO;We had our first cut of two running modules, but we were in no shape to matethem.andM;While Nelson polished the software I drafted text for the pop-upplain-English translations, key features of Reg-In-A-Box.andP;  Testing a batch ofthese windows revealed an unexpected display problem.andP;  And drafting theplain-English window text led me to the development of five simple expertsystems that are embedded in Reg-In-A-Box.andM;The pop-up plain-English window explains the text that the user sees onscreen.andP;  By pressing a hypertext button displayed with the text on-screen,Reg-In-A-Box users pop up a concise explanation in a small, one-page window.andO;However, the main text window scrolls; an explain button for a previous textscreen could appear, apparently the explanation for the screenful of textbelow it.andP;  Our solutions to this problem were different in the PC andMacintosh versions of Reg-In-A-Box.andM;In the PC version the solution was primitive but effective: writeplain-English explanations for each subsection (typically each paragraph) ofthe regulation; give each explanation button a label containing the number ofthe paragraph; and place each button right above the subsection it explains.andO;Finally, the pop-up window would be sized and placed in the upper right partof the screen to leave clue-rich parts of the regulation text still visibleon the screen while the explanation window was open.andP;  This combination oflabeling, placement, and sizing of the hypertext window gives readersredundant cues to help them associate the pop-up explanation with the rightsubsection of the regulation.andM;SOLUTION TOO LABOR-INTENSIVEandM;But this solution was too labor-intensive to implement in the Macintoshversion.andP;  Instead, each major section of the regulation is a treated as ascrolling-window hypertext node that carries its own scrolling-window file ofsubsection (paragraph) explanations.andP;  An explain icon at the bottom of theMacintosh screen opens a scrolling-window containing numbered hypertextexplanations for all subsections.andP;  The explanation window is centered, coversmost of the regulation text, and contains its own independent scroll-bar.andO;Using the scroll-bar in the explanation window, readers can scroll to theexplanation number that corresponds to the paragraph number of concern tothem.andP;  The centrally placed explanation window covers most visual clues ofthe regulation text being explained.andP;  Explanations are not directly linked tothe specific text of the regulation; users must make that link in their ownminds.andM;Some subsections defied simple explanation, especially given space limits ofa one-page window ideally no more than 20 columns by 12 lines.andP;  For example,Congress' language provided that some tanks be exempt, other tanks beexcluded, and that regulation of yet other type tanks be deferred.andO;Reg-In-A-Box users would want simply to know which rule applies to them.andO;Directly answering that question is different than explaining theCongressional criteria for applicability of our regulations.andM;To rely on explanation windows alone would leave users with more inferenceresponsibilities than is desirable.andP;  Though the reasoning involved was simplecompared to most expert systems, it was just complicated enough tomisunderstand and cause major business mistakes in our regulatory community.andO;I tried two different ways of implementing this solution: linked strings ofhypertext and if-then rules in common expert-systems style.andM;We developed a prototype advisor module using KnowledgePro's if-then functionand inserted it linked to its own labelled hypertext button.andP;  However, theinterface for the expert-system function in KnowledgePro required the readerto use different keys to move the cursor and select items than when in thehypertext mode.andP;  To switch the operation of functions so basic as cursormovement and selection would generate a lot of help calls from our users.andP;  Wewanted to minimize our support costs.andM;Instead we would implement the expert-system reasoning using hypertext.andO;Hypertext screens would present a question with multiple answers the usercould choose.andP;  Each answer was a hypertext button leading down a differentthread of hypertext.andP;  This tactic kept the user interface the same, but thehypertext threads quickly became quite complex.andP;  Modules such as this onewould be time-consuming and complex to maintain.andP;  So I devised a differentmethod for developing these hypertext threads.andM;I set a colleague to work with our experts on staff for each of the topics.andO;Using the 1st-CLASS expert-system shell, he captured the implicit reasoningunderlying these sections of the regulation.andP;  Then each substantive expertinspected and confirmed or corrected the 1st-CLASS-produced decision tree.andO;Finally I used a print-out of the decision tree as a manual guide to make thehypertext threads that constitute the five advisor modules now inReg-In-A-Box.andP;  Each expert then went through the hypertext version of theirreasoning, confirming, correcting, and fine-tuning its wording in sessionsthat took approximately two hours for complex modules.andM;INDEPENDENT TESTINGandM;In accordance with agency policy, the beta-test of our product was performedby a different contractor than the one involved in development.andP;  Thebeta-test revealed no major performance problems with the software or itsdesign, aside from the search-function problem.andP;  Both the PC and theMacintosh versions functioned reliably.andP;  Testers were able to use thesoftware with a minimum of instructions, although its installation was aproblem for some.andP;  Our beta-test contractor reported no suggestions from thetesters for major additional functions to be added to the prototype.andP;  Testerswere optimistic that the software would indeed be helpful to persons whowould need to understand our final regulations.andM;Such positive findings from a beta-test are something to be thankful for.andO;Although the test outcome was optimistic, more direct developer involvementin beta-testing would have produced more knowledge about our users'preferences and ways of interacting with hypertext.andP;  Just a few stories ofpoor products can convince you not to let contractors evaluate the merits oftheir own products.andP;  However, beta-testing independent of a developer wastesan opportunity for the developer to learn directly from the user of theproduct.andM;While Nelson and I had developed and tested Reg-In-A-Box using the text ofthe agency's proposed regulation, our regulatory staff was busy crafting thefinal version of the regulation.andP;  To prepare our final version ofReg-In-A-Box we had to have the exact text of the final regulation exactly asit was published in the Federal Register.andP;  The lapse between completion ofthe Reg-In-A-Box beta-test and Federal Register publication of the regulationgave us time to work on solving the text-search problem.andM;SCOUTING FOR SEARCH FUNCTIONSandM;We still lacked an adequate text-search function as we prepared our beta-testprototype.andP;  We scanned the software horizon for a product with all thecapabilities we wanted.andP;  One day Mike Nelson discovered an obscure,one-paragraph description of a hypertext-development shell called BlackMagic.andP;  I ordered and tested it immediately.andP;  It provided most of thefunctions we needed for Reg-In-A-Box, and it had a developer interfacesimilar to WordPerfect's.andP;  I called Black Magic's vendor, Ntergaid Inc., andtold them we had an important application for their product but that weneeded a more powerful text-search function and the capability to accessexternal programs.andP;  Ntergaid was willing to make these changes if we werewilling to pay for them.andM;Within a relatively short time Ntergaid had finished the task and we had adelivery vehicle for our application.andP;  Now Black Magic had a search functionthat searched across all the nodes of a hypertext file and a method for usersto access an external program.andP;  As Ntergaid finished its work our regulatorystaff was finishing its final version of the regulation.andM;When the Federal Register published the first half of the final regulation inlate October the race to complete Reg-In-A-Box resumed.andP;  The features andfunctions of Reg-In-A-Box had been decided.andP;  We had prototyped the ways wewould implement them in the software we had selected to deliver the finalproduct.andM;THE MOVING FINISH LINEandM;Hypertext links for cross-references and plain-English explanations posedunexpected challenges in production of the final version of Reg-In-A-Box.andP;  Asthe contractor cycled developing copies of the application back for my reviewI found incorrect cross-reference links: the numbered paragraph cited in thecross-reference hypertext button was not linked to the corresponding sectionor subsection of the regulation.andP;  It cost us weeks to detect and correctthese mismatches (apparently the product of human error).andP;  Future hypertextapplication-development packages could use functions to support substantivedetection and correction of errors in hypertext links.andM;The producion of plain-English explanations also delayed completion.andP;  Ourbeta-test prototype carried plain-English explanations that duplicated thestyle and size we intended.andP;  But our contractor produced a set ofexplanations that were the contractor's private rewrite of our finalregulation, rather than explanations of what we meant.andP;  This change wouldalarm agency people who were concerned with particular legal or technicalnuances of the regulation's wording.andP;  I discarded the contractor'sexplanations and personally drafted a new set of explanations for review bythe agency's attorneys.andM;I devised a hard-copy workbook format to focus reviewers on the fidelity ofthe explanation compared to the regulatory language.andP;  The workbook presentedthe text of one individual subsection of the regulation language on the leftfacing page, the text of its explanation was on the right facing page.andP;  Thereviewer was instructed to compare the explanation to the text and to confirmor correct it.andP;  This format was fast and practical for agency attorneys touse once they got beyond the visual shock of seeing a several-inch thicknotebook appear on their desk for review.andM;We were nearly ready to ship our final version of the product when twoNtergaid representatives visited us to discuss how to improve Black Magic.andO;As we talked it became apparent that Ntergaid could tweak Black Magic ever soslightly and enable us to give PC Reg-In-A-Box users the capability to printout or export chunks of the regulatory text.andM;Becaue our regulation includes some lengthy fill-in-the-blank legaldocuments, capability to export them to a word processor would probably saveusers the cost (and errors) of retyping these documents.andP;  And a simple printcapability could save people trips to the copy machine when they wanted tocapture the exact wording of our regulation.andP;  The following week Ntergaidsent prototypes of the new print and export functions to us.andP;  Within a coupleof weeks we had the export and print functions working reliably.andM;Now that we were out of the vaporware stage I could fine-tune theinstructions and stalk shareware distributors for the product.andP;  Thecontractor and my office's communications staff collaborated to produce atri-fold brochure including simple instructions.andP;  The brochure answered allthe basic questions about the software and where to get it on one sheet ofpaper; it could easily be copied by users wanting to pass our software alongto their colleagues.andM;Me anwhile, I set out to find distributors.andP;  A shareware catalogue thatappeared in my mailbox fortuituously led me to a distributor for the PCversion (Public Brand Software).andP;  A conversation with a colleague turned up ashareware distributor for the Macintosh version (BudgetBytes).andP;  Ntergaidwould load the application onto their bulletin board.andP;  And a Sierra Clubstaffer referred me to an international telcom service for the environmentalcommunity, EcoNet, which agreed to make Reg-In-A-Box available to theirsubscribers.andM;END OF THE RACEandM;Finally, we crossed the finish line marked by those magic words to themailing contractor: &quot;Ship it!&quot;andP;  Developing Reg-In-A-Box took about two yearsand one person-year of contracor time over that period, in addition to partsof my own time.andP;  It cost approximately $100,000.andP;  These regula tions apply toabout two million tanks at about 750,000 sites.andP;  One gasoline leak from oneunderground storage tank can very easily cost its owner $100,000 to correct.andO;We shipped more than 600 copies of Re g-In-A-Box to people in this regulatorycommunity; two weeks afer release the shareware distributors had shippedabout another 700.andM;These disks have no copy protection.andP;  Although we gave a user-support phonenumber, hardly anyone has called.andP;  Support for this application will cost uslittle or nothing.andP;  We will never know the exac number of copies ofReg-In-A-Box that are out there in the underground storage tank community;there will likely be at least several thousand.andP;  I t also seems likely thatamong those several thousand Reg-In-A-Box users at least one, as a result ofusing Reg-In-A-Box, will prevent or detect a leak before it makes a $100,000problem.andM;If more than one person uses Reg-In-A-Box to this end more than one time, thenation's economy quickly recovers the cost of development.andP;  Reg-In-A-Box hasalso proved that hypertext is for real and that it's available for PCcompatibles and Macintoshes.andP;  With a concrete hypertext application that runsin an ordinary PC environment, many other opportunities to apply hypertextcan be exploited.andM;William H. Foskett manages the development of expert systems for the EPA'soffice of underground storage tanks.andP;  His opinions are his alone and do notnecessarily reflect the views of the depertment.andP;  Mike Nelson, a chemicalengineer with Versar Corp., a consulting engineering firm in Springfield,Va., was instrumental in the development of Reg-in-a-Box.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
