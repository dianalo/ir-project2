FAI's stake is valued at the equivalent of $30.2 million at Hill's current share price.    FAI's London financial adviser, James Capel andamp; Co., said FAI isn't acting &quot;in any way&quot; with NZI Corp., a New Zealand financial-services concern that has accumulated a 4.9% stake in Hill Samuel.    There has been growing speculation among London traders that NZI might launch a bid for Hill Samuel. New Zealand entrepreneur Ronald Brierley, who has mounted a number of takeover attempts in Britain and the U.S. recently, holds a 19% stake in NZI. </TEXT></DOC>
