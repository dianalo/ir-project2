The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents many small and medium-sized businesses, advised its members to make contingency plans for a disruption in postal services. Nova, An Alberta Corp. sent notices to its shareholders instructing them, in the event of a postal strike, to deposit proxy forms for the energy company's June 18 annual meeting with local branches of Toronto-based National Trust Co.    Meanwhile, a rail union negotiator said he is now more encouraged than he was earlier about the prospect for a contract settlement soon between major rail unions and the country's two major railroads, Canadian National Railway and CP Rail, a division of Canadian Pacific Ltd. The two sides are to resume their talks with a federal conciliator tomorrow. Negotiations broke off last Tuesday after the companies failed to respond to the unions' latest proposal, raising concerns about an early strike.    The agreement to resume the talks tomorrow is interpreted by both the unions and the railroads as an encouraging sign. The previous labor contracts expired last Dec. 31 and the unions have been working without contracts since then.    Robert McGarry, president of the Letter Carriers Union of Canada, which represents about 20,000 letter carriers, said government-owned Canada Post Corp., which operates the postal system, &quot;is setting everything in motion for a strike.&quot;    The union and the corporation, which have been in negotiations for a new collective agreement since September, have taken their differences to a federal conciliator. The conciliator is expected to report to the federal labor department early next month. Seven days after the report is submitted, the union will be in a legal position to strike.    Contract talks between the corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents about 23,000 mail sorters and other postal workers, also have been referred to a conciliator.    Donald Lander, Canada Post's president, denied that the corporation was looking for a strike as a way of forcing the unions to abandon restrictive work practices. But he warned that &quot;We at Canada Post are determined to do something about bringing the cost base of our postal operations into line with those of other businesses.&quot;    Mr. Lander told the National Association of Major Mail Users that &quot;Canadians have been held to ransom through postal strikes in the past.&quot; He said that if a strike occurs the corporation would try to maintain service to its customers. In the past, operations have been suspended during strikes.    Mr. McGarry said the letter carriers believe the government and Canada Post have &quot;a hidden agenda&quot; to turn over much of the postal operations to the private sector. He said the letter carriers don't want a strike. &quot;But if we are going to lose our jobs anyway because of privatization, we might as well get on with the battle now,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
