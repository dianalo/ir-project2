(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>After years stagnation, MultiMate leaps into the 20th century.andP;  Version 4.0of AshtonTate's $565 word processor boasts virtually all the functions thattoday's electronic office uses for Preparing documents, in a combination thatisn't matched by any other package.andP;  Multimate now comes with a grammarchecker, integrated graphics editing, print preview, automatic import fromother word processors, parallel and snaking columns, and electronic mailusing Action Technologies' familiar MHS system.andM;Because all of MultiMate,s functions can now be accessed from clear pull-downmenus, the battleship-size keyboard template of earlier versions has shrunkto a simple function-key chart.andP;  In place of the old flotilla of manuals,there's a single alPhabetical guide.andP;  But the program still works much likethe Multimate of old.andP;  That's good news if your office is an entrenchedMultimate bastion and values consistency.andP;  It's bad news if you hoped the newMultimate would STOP making you work your way through giant menus beforeaccomplishing anything or that it would shed enough of its clumsy editing andlimited formatting to justify a switch from something else.andM;multimate works best if you use it in an office where word processing needsare limited to letters, reports, and simple mail-merge, using fixed-pitchprinting with a daisy wheel or dot matrix printer.andP;  The program can handlemore-complex documents and can manage a LaserJet or Postscript printer, butat the price of excessive effort and frustration.andM;If your office uses multiple word processors, Multimate 4.andP;  0 can act astranslator.andP;  It automatically imports (and Optionally exports) over 30formats, including WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Wordstar, Lotus, Manuscript,OfficeWriter, and DCA; further conversion filters are available fromAshton-Tate.andP;  You can import but not export 1-2-3 and DBASE files.andP;  Isuccessfully imported and exported complex WordPerfect and Word files withfootnotes, foreign characters, and format changes, although margins and tabsneeded minor adjustments.andM;For graphics Multimate uses a custom version of Inset Systems' HiJaak.andP;  Youcan create drawings with a mouse and overlay text in a variety of fonts.andP;  Oryou can capture screens and import image files, then resize, rotate, or editthem.andP;  Powerful as these functions are, they are imPerfectly integrated.andO;When you insert an image into a file, you have to give it room to print bymanually adding blank lines.andP;  To locate an image horizontally, You type tabsor spaces to the left of a code that contains its filename.andM;While rival Programs edge into the desktop publishing field, Multimate offersonly Primitive support for laser printers-although it includes a copy ofBitstream's Fontware.andP;  ProPortional laser output is a separate item on theprint menu from ordinary printing.andP;  Once you choose it, You lose a  lot ofcontrol Over your file.andP;  The program automatically repaginates and hyphenatesyour text, and you can see the changes only on an uneditable Preview screen.andO;Hyphenation can't be turned off with proportional printing, and You'relimited to 60 footnotes per file.andM;Multimate doesn't know which line height to use with Proportional fonts, soyou have to enter the number of lines per inch by hand.andP;  Worse, you can useonly whole numbers, and the same number applies throughout the file.andP;  Themanual actually suggests using superscripts and subscripts to adjust linepositioning for headlines.andP;  The ordinary print menu lets you choose printersby name; the proportional output menu requires You to remember the obscurecode names of your printer files.andM;One advantage of proportional printing is that the program repaginatesautomatically.andP;  h normal printing, you have to give a repagination commandafter inserting text or footnotes-a requirement that doesn't belong in anymodem word processor.andP;  You can't directly delete a page break, ad you have togive a command in order to combine two pages.andP;  Multimate's screen is litteredwith obscure symbols and letters representing format changes-it's easy toconfuse format commands with text.andM;Multimate's thesaurus offers brief definitions, and the Program UsesReference Software's Grammatik IV as a built-in grammar checker.andP;  You cantell Grammatik to test your prose against different sets of rules forInformal, Technical, Fictional, and other kinds of writing.andP;  It can eithermark your file for later reference or display stylistic problems and give youa chance to edit them on-screen.andP;  For a full review of Grammatik IV, see page46 of this issue.)andM;For the legal market, MultiMate now offers line numbering, redlining, tablesof authority, and a special legal dictionary, but WordPerfect's legalfeatures are easier to use and more extensive.andP;  If you want to use otherprograms from within Multimate, you can build a menu Of applications.andO;Typical of the program as a whole, it can delete items from the menu, butthey can't be modified or rearranged.andM;Multimate 4.0 will gratify everyone who is too committed to the program toswitch to anything else.andP;  If You've already switched, it offers no temptationto switch back.andM;Multimate, Version 4.0 Ashton-Tate, 20101 Hamilton Ave., Torrance, CA905021319; (213) 329-=.andM;List Price: $565; upgrade; $75 Requires: 400K RAM, hard disk with 8MB free,DOS 3.1 or later.andM;In Short-  andamp; Mate's combination of advanced features is unique among currentword processors but its implementation is too awkward for Version 4.0 to beconsidered anything but an upgrade.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
