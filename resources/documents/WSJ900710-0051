On the one hand, he says he's still pushing for acut in the capital-gains rate. On the other hand, there's nowtalk of up to a 0.5% tax on transfers of stocks, bonds andfutures. This would obviously burden the growth effects of acut in the gains rate. We are tempted to dismiss thisproposal as patently absurd, except that with lip reading outof style we can take nothing for granted.   Loose lips sink shares. For starters, how about a fall inshare prices of between 9.3% and 14.6% and a drop in volumeof 12.7%? These are some of the unhappy estimates of theimpact of a 0.5% transfer tax made by the CongressionalResearch Service. The group studied the issue in March 1987,the last time anyone -- then-Speaker Jim Wright -- floatedthis possible tax.</LP><TEXT>   A transfer tax would be the worst kind of betrayal of taxreform. By its very nature, this tax would discourageeconomically sensible deals. Every possible trade would beaffected by the tax, which would raise the cost of capital bymaking it more expensive to move capital from one investmentto another.   &quot;The higher transaction costs and lower trading volumewould reduce the efficiency of the stock market in the sensethat some transactions which are justified on the basis ofthe underlying economics would no longer occur,&quot; thecongressional report said. &quot;The tax would make the cost ofsome investments prohibitive. For other investments it wouldcreate a `lock-in' effect; selling an existing investment andbuying another might increase the expected return, but thetransaction costs associated with the trade would exceed thepotential gain.&quot;   It is passing strange that the proposal should waft out ofthe Treasury, where Secretary Nicholas Brady has complainedabout volatility in the markets. The congressional report,which came before the 1987 crash, noted that &quot;reduced tradingvolume would also decrease the liquidity of the stock marketsomewhat and could possibly increase volatility, since largerprice changes may be required to match demand and supply in amarket with less volume.&quot;   The effects could be even more dramatic in the futuresmarkets. The Chicago Board of Trade estimates a soybeanfutures contract for $65,000 worth of soybeans that now costsabout $75 to transact would cost about $400. A 0.5% tax onthis contract explains the $325 difference. Farmers shouldask why the federal government would want them to choosebetween paying extortionate amounts in transaction taxes orforgetting about hedging their risks.   Even the estimated revenues of between $8 billion and $10billion a year are highly suspect products of 1970s-stylestatic analysis. If fewer trades are done, less revenue willcome in.   International competition would guarantee fewerU.S.-taxable trades. Any effort to tax Americans on foreignexchanges is doomed to fail. Modems, faxes and satellitesmake markets highly portable. Many trades will migrate tolowest-cost markets. Several countries have no taxes onsecurities transactions. Indeed, the major countries that dohave transfer taxes, including Japan, Britain and Canada, aremoving to abolish or lower them. Even the socialist mayor ofFrankfurt, accompanied by a representative of his Green Partygovernment coalition, not long ago told a group of Journaleditors that they hoped Bonn would abolish the Germanstock-transfer tax so that Frankfurt could compete with theCity of London.   Since there is no economic justification for this tax, andwith the administration seemingly content to let theseproposals wander around in public, we're left to speculatethat they must lie in someone's political constellation. DickDarman may figure this would be good soak-the-rich politics,perhaps to ease a capital-gains cut. Or maybe Secretary Bradyfigures he can punish his pet peeve of short-term investingby making it more expensive to trade as often as the marketdemands. The weak distinction between long- and short-terminvesting aside, someone should remind the White House thatpension plans and mutual funds do much of the risk-hedgingand other high-volume trading. Union officials worried aboutreturns on pensions are already lobbying against this tax.   As we say, it's hard to treat this as a serious proposal.Maybe the White House is tossing up trial tax balloons to seethem shot down. This kind of political game, though, worksbest only when there is clear, reliable leadership that willjust say no to bad ideas.   It is now clear that the price President Bush's opponents,and perhaps even some friends, will make him pay for droppinghis no-tax pledge will come in the dear coin of credibility.No one can know which of today's wacko tax proposals willbecome tomorrow's tax policies. There is a caldron brewing ofgreat uncertainty and risk. The last time a national leaderlost control of economic policy we suffered a malaise notsuffered in this country for more than a decade.</TEXT></DOC>
