After 14 hours of talks that ended about 3:30 a.m., chief Boeingnegotiator Larry McKean said the production workers could be backon the job as early as Wednesday at the world's No. 1 maker ofpassenger jets.   ``At this point we're looking forward to a favorable vote onthis contract and a return to normal operations,'' he said.   ``This proposal is a substantial improvement'' over previousoffers, said Tom Baker, president of Seattle-area District Lodge751, which represents nearly four-fifths of the Boeing workerscovered by the Machinists contract.   ``I feel it will be ratified overwhelmingly,'' he said. Despiterepeated assertions by Boeing officials that there would be noincrease in the company's pre-strike financial offer, Baker said,``There is more money on the table.''   He would give few specifics of the new offer, but said itimproved pay, medical coverage, overtime requirements and thepromotional system.   Negotiators for the union were divided, saying arguments for andagainst ratification would be presented when members meet to voteon the three-year pact Monday. But most negotiators arerecommending acceptance, Baker said.   ``I'm pretty sure everybody will go for it. We're tired ofstanding around in the rain,'' Elaine Campbell, one of thosepicketing in a steady rain outside a Boeing jet plant in theSeattle suburb of Renton, Wash.   ``There's a lot of people out there hurting,'' said anotherpicket, Steve Bogdun said. ``I don't think any of us are looking toget rich. We're just looking for the old fair share of the pie.''   The strike, which began Oct. 4, brought production at Boeing toa virtual halt, delaying deliveries to airlines worldwide amidrising concern over aging passenger jets.   Mediator Doug Hammond said he proposed the deal a few hoursafter talks resumed Saturday for the first time in two weeks. Hesaid submitting his own recommendation, rather than helping the twosides toward a settlement, was ``an unusual and for me a rarestep.''   He said he had used that tactic only once before in his 15 yearswith the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.   Baker and McKean praised Hammond's action.   ``The parties were far apart on the issues, and I guess what ittook was some bold steps on the part of the mediator to bring theparties together,'' Baker said.   ``I believe that because of the meetings that we've had _ wewere kind of at loggerheads, I would say _ it was good andprofessional for him to step in and give both parties a hand,''McKean said.   Justin Ostro, an international union vice president who is incharge of aerospace industry negotiations for the Machinists,attacked both the agreement and the mediator's role.   ``This was a 3-to-2 vote (by the union negotiating team) on theproposal tonight, and I would have to share _ since I am not avoting member _ the opinion of the two,'' Ostro said.   ``The mediator, I think, breached his responsibility forneutrality,'' he added. ``He proposed an offer at 4 p.m. today(Saturday) without the opportunity of negotiating or changing oramending that offer, and it failed to address the workers' majorissues, which were general wage increases.''   In contracts in 1983 and 1986, the Machinists accepted annualproductivity bonuses instead of wage increases. This year, withBoeing riding years of record profits and orders for jetsstretching into the late 1990s, wage gains were a top unionpriority.   The Machinists represent 43,300 workers in the Seattle area;12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundredothers at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming,Montana, North Dakota and other states. Kansas, however, is aright-to-work state, and 3,500 to 4,000 of the Boeing workers theredo not belong to the union.   Probably more than 50,000 workers were on strike, but theprecise number was not known because some union members crossedpicket lines and some non-members stayed out.   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in NewYork, said earlier that he thought both sides probably feltincreasing pressure to settle.   The pressure could have come from government agencies worriedabout the inflationary effects of high wage demands, the falloutfrom the strike on military contractors around the country, and theeffects on the nation's trade balance from a halt in production atsuch a major exporter, Nisbet said.</TEXT></DOC>
