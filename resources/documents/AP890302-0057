PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother who wanted to bring herterminally ill 3-year-old daughter home to die got a judge's ordergranting her custody and read it aloud in the child's hospital room.   But little Candice Dutchak never made it home. She died fiveminutes later.   ``It was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order toher parents,'' said Sara Rahdert, an attorney who helped CherylDutchak win back her daughter from state custody. ``I know thatsounds strange, but that was what it was like,''   Mrs. Dutchak spent nearly a year fighting to bring Candice hometo die. A judge signed the order Monday in Clearwater and Ms.Rahdert rushed it to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg,about 25 miles away.   Candice suffered health problems caused by a loss of amnioticfluid during her mother's pregnancy. Doctors had recommended anabortion.   Complications kept the newborn in the hospital for two months.She lost her right leg at the knee because of circulation problems.And later, her kidneys began to fail.   Last March, Candice suffered brain damage after a seizure, whichdoctors said occurred when Mrs. Dutchak withheld medication. Mrs.Dutchak said an emergency room doctor told her to withhold themedicine.   In April, the Florida Department of Health and RehabilitativeServices charged Mrs. Dutchak with child abuse and took the babyaway.   The charge was dropped, but the state retained custody and agreedto work out a compromise, stating that the mother could take thebaby home if she proved she was fit.   The baby's condition worsened and on Monday, doctors called Mrs.Dutchak and said Candice was close to death.   Ms. Rahdert sought an emergency custody order, and a hearing wasscheduled. But Department of Health and Rehabilitative SservicesDistrict Administrator Michael Becker agreed ``for humanitarianreasons'' to release the girl to her mother.   Circuit Judge Jack Page signed the order transferring custodyabout 12:45 p.m., the attorney said.   ``I dashed from the courthouse ... to the hospital ... Cherylread the order out loud stating that they did get custody back,''Ms. Rahdert said. `About five minutes after mom read this order outloud to everyone in the room, including the child, the child died....   ``It was a very hollow victory.''</TEXT></DOC>
