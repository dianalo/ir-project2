The airline, 39.4%-owned by the Dutch government, said revenue in the fiscal second quarter increased 11%, to 1.66 billion guilders ($831.5 million) from 1.49 billion guilders.    Analysts said reduced price competition on the North Atlantic routes that supply KLM with 40% of its annual revenue helped boost profit, as did the airline's effort to attract more business-class passengers and fewer discount-fare tourist flyers.    The results exceeded expectations, prompting a 1.20-guilder increase in KLM's share price, to 40.10 guilders ($20.09).    Earnings would have been even higher if not for a 53.9 million-guilder extraordinary charge for provisions against future tax liability. That charge was partially offset by a 28.3 million-guilder gain on the sale of three aircraft.    For the fiscal first half, KLM's net income rose 8%, to 285.8 million guilders from 264.9 million guilders a year earlier. Revenue increased 12%, to 2.65 billion guilders from 2.37 billion guilders. </TEXT></DOC>
