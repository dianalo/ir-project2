It's our naughty computer that keeps breaking the law.    The law tells the IRS to wait 90 days after issuing a deficiency notice before trying to collect. If a taxpayer takes the matter to Tax Court, the IRS must hold off until the case is resolved. Yet, soon after Paul and Gina Husby proceeded to Tax Court, the IRS billed the San Francisco couple $47,000. A computer error, an IRS attorney assured them; don't worry.    But more bills came, and the agency grabbed nearly $3,800 in Paul's credit union. Even after a federal court ordered a halt, the unlawful collection action went on. Finally, the IRS curbed itself, returned the credit union money, but argued the Husby's lawsuit for damages should be summarily dismissed. District Court Judge Weigel recently noted that the IRS &quot;position boils down to the contention that the whole unfortunate incident was really nobody's fault, but the computers'.&quot;    That won't let the agency off the hook, the judge said, ruling that the case should proceed to trial.    A GENEROUS IRS eyes debt swaps among U.S. banks, foreign governments.    Debtor governments are using swaps to settle billions of dollars past-due at U.S. banks. To see how one works assume the government of Outta Bucks owes $100 -- worth 1,000 O.B. pesos at current rates. A typical swap would call for the U.S. bank to sell the loan to a U.S. firm for $60. Outta Bucks pays off the debt for 900 pesos that the firm can use only in that country for business or charitable purposes.    The bank got a nonperforming loan off its books; the government, less debt; and the firm, funds at a 33 1/3% discount. In a revenue ruling, the IRS says the bank gets a $40 bad debt write-off, while the U.S. firm has a taxable gain only if the pesos are worth more than $60. &quot;The IRS could have taken a harder position,&quot; says Thomas B. Joyce, of Peat Marwick Main. A case can be made for reporting no gain as the pesos can't be used outside of Outta Bucks.    IT'S ENOUGH to make new S corporations wish they weren't.    Congress wants to change the rules on corporations that switched to S status this year, removing a limit on how much tax they must pay on gains from liquidating assets owned before they became S corporations. While their earnings normally are taxed to their shareholders, the gains tax is levied on the corporations themselves. Under current rules the gain that's taxed doesn't exceed the amount of taxable income the firm would have if it hadn't changed to S status.    &quot;The theory was that an S corporation shouldn't have to pay any more than if it were a C {regular} corporation,&quot; says J. Fred Kubik, a Wichita, Kan., tax expert. A proposed technical correction removes the limitation, and thus, a personal-service firm, for example, with $100,000 of receivables before S status would have a $100,000 taxable gain, if it collected the receivables this year, even though its taxable profit would be less as a regular corporation.    &quot;In our opinion this isn't a technical correction, but a substantive change in the law,&quot; says Samuel P. Starr, of Coopers andamp; Lybrand.    HERB ALPERT and his wife Lani Hall and other owners of a Hyatt Hotel near Los Angeles' airport renovated the hostelry more than 10 years ago. But only recently did the 9th Circuit declare they could deduct $270,268 of the work that the IRS wanted them to capitalize.    A DEBT-SADDLED farmer turned his farm and equipment over to the FMHA to settle a $122,623 loan. The IRS rules privately he can deduct some $3,600 of interest FMHA treated as paid by the assets.    A DIFFERENCE? Commissioner Gibbs says the IRS is creating its own experts in artificial intelligence, which he describes as &quot;making computers act like humans.&quot;    RELOCATE AND DEDUCT: Relocation costs reimbursed by a company are wages subject to payroll tax and withholding except for the amount the employee can deduct, the IRS rules privately.    COMPETENT AUTHORITY'S competency won't count if IRS acts as feared.    Practitioners fear proposed IRS rules on valuing imported goods will override competent authority procedures that resolve pricing disputes between the U.S. and other countries. U.S. firms importing goods from their foreign units count on competent authority to assure that prices mandated by tax agents in another country will be adjusted by the same amount here. Otherwise, millions more in tax would be paid in one country without a tax-saving adjustment in the other.    Intended to stop firms from diddling with values to cut taxes and customs duties, the proposed rules, based on the 1986 tax act, say a firm can't use an inventory cost larger than the customs value. The rules say nothing about inventory costs changed by competent authority, but IRS officials privately say the law overrides them.    &quot;One of the questions is whether this will deteriorate the competent authority relationship that the IRS has with various treaty partners,&quot; says Steven P. Hannes, of Touche Ross.    BRIEFS: Contact the IRS to get in on a test of filing employee benefit plans electronically in 1988. . . . OMB wants federal forms to state estimated time to complete them. . . . The IRS vehemently opposes time estimates for tax forms, fearing negative public reaction. </TEXT></DOC>
