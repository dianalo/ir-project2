The pilot, Lt. Frank Cavouti of Garden City, N.Y., was ending atraining mission and approaching for a landing at the Royal AirForce base in Alconbury, when the crash occurred, said an Air Forcespokesman.   It was the second crash of a twin-engine Thunderbolt jet inEurope in two weeks. A third A-10 crashed on Dec. 8 in Tracy, Ariz.   Cavouti was being held for observation at a military hospital.His jet crashed several miles west of this central English villageand about 60 miles north of London, said the spokesman, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Witnesses said it appeared the pilot was trying to miss thisvillage and hit the open field.   Tony Woolsenhomes, 53, of the nearby village of Earith, said hewatched Cavouti's jet circle for about 30 minutes and ``knew it wasin trouble. It seemed to me he was circling to look for somewhereaway from the village to put the plane down.''   The spokesman said a board of officers would investigate theincident.   He said Cavouti was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing atAlconbury. The aircraft was carrying ``dummy bombs and practice 33mmammunition,'' he added.   The A-10, a jet designed to support troops by hitting enemy tanksand other ground targets, is an older model plane designed to behighly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude and to carry alot of bombs and ammunition.   Thursday's crash came two weeks after an A-10 slammed into theWest German city of Remscheid, killing five and injuring dozens.   The Remscheid crash prompted the United States and its NATOallies to agree to suspend all A-10 flights over West Germany untilJan. 2. The suspension was ordered as West German political partiesand public interest groups increased their demands for an end tolow-level flight training in West Germany.   On the same day as the Remscheid crash, an A-10 crashed near theheart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, about 80 miles westof Tuscon. The pilot ejected safely.   The Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational withthe Air Force in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but theAir Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.   Statistically, the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter orattack plane now in the inventory.</TEXT></DOC>
