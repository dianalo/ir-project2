In 1983, the Supreme Court affirmed the IRS's power to deny exemption to Bob Jones University for race discrimination. Now the IRS has updated and expanded its manual for auditors who check compliance in &quot;a difficult and sensitive . . . area.&quot; &quot;The ultimate test . . . is equal availability to all racial and ethnic groups.&quot; Absent a large number of minority students, auditors must make &quot;thorough inquiries&quot; into a school's practices, not just its policies, to see if it is trying in good faith to comply.    Among many tests, auditors are to check correspondence soliciting funds and granting or denying admission or financial aid. Interviewing minority-group and other community leaders may help. So may reviews of student yearbooks. Auditors should see if a school relies on religious tenets to restrict student relationships or admissions from certain racial or ethnic groups. Tuition aid from outside the school may further or hinder nondiscrimination.    If a school doesn't get federal or state aid or use state textbooks, it may be important to learn why.    THE IRS HEATS UP leftover income reports to smoke out non-filers.    About 15.2 million reports by payers of dividends and other income in 1984 were late or lacked valid ID numbers and couldn't be checked against personal returns; nine million addresses were involved. Now the IRS will trace 20,000 addresses to see if the otherwise unusable Form 1099s and other reports lead to people who didn't file returns. For this pilot study, it chose reports of payments of $10,000 to $100,000.    The IRS will try correspondence first; unresolved cases in five categories will go to agents in five districts by July 1 for completion by Nov. 30. The districts: Jacksonville, Fla., medical and health-related income; Newark, N.J., brokers' gross-proceeds reports; Hartford, Conn., dividends; Austin, Texas, non-employee compensation, and Portland, Ore., other income.    TENACIOUS ABOUT TENURE, the prof won a settlement for losing her job.    Ana Maria Metzger, a naturalized American from Cuba, lost an associate professorship of Spanish at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., when it refused, in a late notice, to grant her tenure. She sued for breach of contract and also charged discrimination based on her sex and national origin. A federal board saw &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to find sex discrimination. The college settled her claims in 1975 for $75,000 without admitting liability.    &quot;For tax purposes only,&quot; the agreement allotted half the money to wage claims and half to all other claims; Metzger treated half as taxable and half as exempt damages for personal injury. But the IRS billed her for tax on all of it. Now Tax Court Judge Chabot has upheld Metzger's position -- yet not because of the agreement, which actually disavowed the split as a tax maneuver. Rather, the judge said, the school's intent clearly was to avoid litigation over discrimination claims as well as lost pay.    But Metzger may deduct legal fees only for her recovered pay.    REIMBURSEMENT by an employer for moving costs is taxable income. Yet the costs now are deductible only if itemized; reimbursed employees who don't itemize lose offsetting deductions. That makes the costs the only reimbursed employee expense that isn't automatically a &quot;wash&quot; on returns, says Prof. Israel Blumenfrucht of Queens College.    BAD CHECKS to the IRS in 1986's first half totaled 184,177; on 82%, it assessed $3.1 million in bad-check penalties ranging up to 1% of checks for $500 or more. The General Accounting Office says Congress may want to consider doubling the minimum penalty, which has been $5 since 1954.    INSTANT GRATIFICATION: Preparers in seven test areas filed 78,000 computer-ready returns by wire to claim refunds averaging $1,200. The IRS deposited 12,200 refunds directly in bank accounts. It plans to expand the program greatly in 1988.    HERE'S HOW ONE SON arranged for payments from his late mother's IRA.    The mother of a 28-year-old we'll call Dan died in 1986 at age 67 before drawing any funds from her individual retirement account. As named beneficiary, he wants to change the IRA's trustee and then take annual payouts over the 16.9 years that, actuarily speaking, were her life expectancy when she died. The IRS tells in private ruling 8716058 why it approved Dan's plans.    The IRS held previously that transfers of IRA funds from trustee to trustee, whether initiated by the first trustee or the IRA owner, aren't payouts and don't hurt an IRA's tax deferral. Now it says that holds true for transfers directed by Dan as named beneficiary -- if the IRA remains in his mother's name. Also, if an IRA owner dies before getting payments, all funds generally must be paid out in five years. But as named beneficiary, Dan gets an exception:    He can base payouts on his own life expectancy -- or a shorter period such as 16.9 years (payouts must start by a year after his mother's death).    BRIEFS: Warren L. and Gail I. Becher of Niagara Falls, N.Y., may not deduct organic foods as medical costs of coping with allergic reactions that included &quot;foggy thinking,&quot; the Tax Court held. . . . The &quot;blue book&quot; explanation of the 1986 tax act by the staff of Congress's joint tax committee is expected to be available Friday from the Government Printing Office. </TEXT></DOC>
