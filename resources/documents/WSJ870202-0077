Proponents say that privatization could improve America's competitive position in the international enrichment business, provide new tax receipts and actually strengthen U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear-weapons technology in the Third World. They could well be right.    From the beginning of civilian nuclear-power development until the early 1970s, the U.S. government supplied all of the free world's enriched uranium. This monopolistic position eventually resulted in repeated price rises and suspensions of new orders in the 1970s; the Department of Energy's prices rose more than 400% from 1970 to 1980. Europeans, who were already developing their own enrichment facilities, accelerated their efforts. As a result, the U.S. share of the free-world enrichment has fallen from 100% as late as 1974 to about 46% in 1986. Moreover, the slowdown in new nuclear-plant construction has created excess free-world enrichment capacity. (The Soviet Union also hopes to make inroads in the free-world enrichment market.)    The Atomic Industrial Forum, representing nuclear-power producers and plant builders, has recommended private-sector involvement. &quot;We believe a competitive enrichment business -- one consisting of multiple domestic suppliers of enrichment services -- would more efficiently respond to market pressures, thus contributing to lower costs,&quot; AIF President Carl Walske said in a recent letter to Energy Secretary John Herrington. &quot;Lower costs would, in turn, help to maintain a dominant U.S. market presence in this sensitive technology and contribute to the nation's non-proliferation goals.&quot;    With the growth of European enrichment services, the U.S. already is losing direct control over exports that might aid nuclear-weapons development. The French construction of an Iraqi reactor, which the Israelis later bombed, is a case in point. Even with private enrichment, exports would remain under federal control, recognizing that non-proliferation is a valid foreign-policy goal.    Federal monopolies usually prove costly and inefficient, and it seems uranium enrichment is no exception. Privatization could make the industry more competitive, alleviate many of the price and supply problems, and net a few dollars for the Treasury. With due respect for non-proliferation policy, it's an idea exploring. </TEXT></DOC>
