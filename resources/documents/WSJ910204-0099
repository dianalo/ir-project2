Resolution Trust Corp., the Sandamp;L cleanup agency, couldunload about $17 billion of its current $146 billion inassets taken over from failed thrifts by &quot;securitizing&quot; them.Junk bonds, mortgages and loans would be pooled together, andthe agency would sell securities backed by those assets.</LP><TEXT>   But on the verge of completing a multimillion-dollaroffering backed by high-yield junk bonds, the agency's boardexpressed reservations, and raised the possibility that theycould be held personally liable if investors were unhappywith the securities. &quot;If someone takes a trading loss,&quot; musedone employee, &quot;do I lose my house?&quot;   The agency has put on hold its plans to sell the assets assecurities until Congress passes legislation indemnifying theagency on the sales. &quot;The review of the law indicated thatthere were some areas of at least potential concern,&quot; saidWilliam Roelle, deputy director of the agency.   Aid from Capitol Hill, however, may not be quick incoming. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, saidhis committee's legal counsel advised him that thelegislation is unnecessary, and government officials aresubject to other legal protections under federal law. Mr.Gonzalez went so far, at a hearing last week, as to questionwhether the agency's board couldn't be charged withmalfeasance &quot;for refusing to fulfill its statutory mandate ofselling assets.&quot;   Mr. Roelle said the agency will continue to package theloans, mortgages and bonds as securities, to be sold when theliability issue is resolved. &quot;All this work isn't coming to acomplete halt,&quot; he said. Before the thrift cleanup isfinished, the agency may have to sell as much as $500 billionin Sandamp;L assets, with much of it in securitized form.   Securitizing also presents an avenue to shift someless-than-marketable assets back to the private sector. Thereis no market for much of the $5 billion in high-yield junkbond issues the RTC holds, but Wall Street firms expect theycould find buyers for securities backed by a variety of junkissues. &quot;If they have to sell these on an item-by-item basis,they will get skimmed, and left only with the worst of theworst,&quot; said Richard Dorfman, managing director of ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc., which has acquired more than $1 billionin loans from the agency.   Wall Street, he said, has become accustomed to the stopsand starts of the agency, which as he notes &quot;is notcustomcrafted to be an issuer of securities. I can't say thatI expect this to be settled any time soon.&quot;   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said last week that hefavored halting the sales until the question of liability foragency personnel is resolved. &quot;My only observation is thatwhen you've got assets in the billions of dollars, that's apretty big number for anybody having over his head,&quot; he toldthe House Banking Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
