However, Saturday's vote did not signal authorization for astrike. The 5,500-member union and the company are expected tostick with the existing contract that expires Aug. 14 and re-enternegotiations sometime this summer.   BIW had invited its unions to open contract talks early, inhopes of improving its competitiveness. It lost four of five Navycruiser contracts in February to rival Ingalls Shipbuilding ofMississippi.   The proposed contract, which offered three annual 2.5 percentwage increases and the phase-out of a two-tier pay system thatgives less to new employees, was rejected by a margin of roughly 3to 2, said Ray Ladd, president of Local 6 of the Industrial Unionof Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America.   About 2,500 of the union's approximately 5,500 membersparticipated in the voting.   ``I feel it should have gone through, because I don't feelthey're going to offer any more in August,'' Ladd said.   Duane D. Fitzgerald, BIW's executive vice president, issued astatement saying management officials were ``disappointed with theresult but believe the process was constructive and informative.''   ``We do not regret having made the effort,'' Fitzgerald said.   Ladd blamed the rejection in part on members' desire for biggerpay hikes and a swifter end to the two-tier wage system. He said heunderstood rank-and-file sentiments but added, ``the company hasn'tgot any money. They opened the books and proved it.''   Under the current contract, newer employees have been paid about$3 less an hour than veteran workers. The rejected company proposalwould have phased out the two-tier system in April 1990.   The proposed 2.5 percent wage increase would have amounted to 29cents an hour more for first-class mechanics in the first two yearsof the contract and 30 cents an hour more the final year.   Members of Local 7, a much smaller union representing 393clerical and technical workers, overwhelmingly approved a newthree-year contract a week ago.   The shipyard, Maine's largest private employer, reached itshighest peacetime employment level last month, reporting 8,900workers on its payroll.</TEXT></DOC>
