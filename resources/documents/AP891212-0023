SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A South American metals dealer was orderedheld without bail after pleading innocent to directing thelaundering of a half-billion dollars for a notorious Colombiancocaine cartel.   Raul Silvio Vivas of Argentina, who was extradited from Uruguaydespite escalating anti-extradition terrorism, is named in 26counts contained in two federal indictments.   The 39-year-old Vivas entered his pleas Monday before two judgesand listened through an interpreter as Assistant U.S. AttorneyRussell Hayman described the charges. Vivas is accused of being atop member of the Medellin cartel's money-laundering operations.   For at least two years beginning in 1985, he used hismoney-changing house in Montevideo to launder cocaine profits fromthe United States, disguising them by real or ``paper'' goldtransactions, Hayman told U.S. District Judge William D. Keller.   ``There was about $250 million laundered in this manner,''Hayman said. ``We have bank records supporting those figures.''   A second indictment, to which Vivas pleaded innocent beforeJudge Consuelo Marshall, alleges another $250 million waslaundered, Hayman said. He said he did not know why the FBI earlierhad said Vivas was involved in laundering $1 billion.   Vivas' attorney, Martin L. Schmukler, suggested he might askthat Vivas be tried separately from other defendants. All told, 32people, many from Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district, are namedin the indictments, along with one corporation.   But Keller said he was unlikely to sever Vivas' case and toldSchmukler to return to his court today to consult with otherdefense attorneys, who planned to ask that evidence from wiretapsbe thrown out. Keller tentatively set trial for Jan. 27.   Vivas was arrested in February and had fought extradition sinceMarch in a Uruguayan jail.   Asked if Vivas had done business with the other defendants,Schmukler said, ``If he did, they were professional dealings, notcriminal dealings.''   Uruguayan national police turned Vivas over to FBI agents at anaval base under heavy guard Friday and he was flown to Californiathat night.   Just two days earlier, a bombing blamed on cocaine traffickerskilled dozens and wounded hundreds outside Colombia's policeintelligence headquarters. A group of drug lords calling themselves``the Extraditables'' has been waging a campaign of bombings andassassinations to force the government to end its war on the cartel.   The U.S. indictment, issued in February, charges Vivas and theothers with carrying out the largest Colombian drug cartel moneylaundering operation ever uncovered by American law enforcementauthorities. Several defendants already have pleaded guilty.</TEXT></DOC>
