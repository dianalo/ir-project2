First is a description of the structureof the fuelwood industry, focussing on how people and businesses supplyfuelwood to end users, and on how wood combustion generates further economicactivity. Second, we describe how we combine input/output (I/O) analysiswith our understanding of the structure of the fuelwood industry to developincome and job impact estimates for the region.
