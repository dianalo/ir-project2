Wesuspect Mr. Ikle may have identified a key post-war fulcrumin his essay on this page last Friday, noting that GeorgeBush has determined to make the United Nations an instrumentof his developing world order. The implications of thiscommitment deserve further exploration.   The President's February 15 speech to the Raytheon factoryworkers has lately become famous for these words: &quot;Andthere's another way for the bloodshed to stop, and that isfor the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take mattersinto their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator,to step aside. . . .&quot; More attention should be paid to thePresident's words that immediately preceded that famous line:&quot;Until a credible withdrawal begins, with those Iraqi troopsvisibly leaving Kuwait, the Coalition forces, in compliancewith United Nations Resolution 678, will continue theirefforts to force compliance with all those resolutions, everysingle one of them.&quot;   By common agreement, Mr. Bush has made masterful use ofthe authority of the United Nations in prosecuting the waragainst Iraq. Those efforts culminated in Security CouncilResolution 678, which authorized the use of force againstIraq. The force that followed was overwhelming, devastatingand short. Mr. Bush's victory was also widely seen asachieving a long hoped-for purpose of the United Nations.However, the necessary point to understand about thisachievement is that the successful implementation ofResolution 678 and the many related resolutions that precededit depended entirely on American leadership, on Mr. Bush'swillingness to enforce the resolutions. More plainly, thePresident imposed them.   Now in the postwar period we have had two more U.N.resolutions. Resolution 687 on April 3 laid out the terms ofthe cease-fire agreement. Three days later, Resolution 688condemned Iraq's repression of its population.   These resolutions are worth noting. Their scope isambitious and often precise. And, as with the pre-warresolutions, they only have meaning if the United Statesguarantees their enforcement. Obviously that means bymilitary means if necessary.   The cease-fire resolution, 687, essentially makes Iraq award of the U.N. Citing Iraq's violation of most of thesignificant arms conventions of this century, the U.N.requires Iraq to unconditionally accept on-site inspection ofits war plants right now, and the &quot;ongoing monitoring andverification&quot; of its compliance with these requirements. Morepointedly, the resolution calls on all states &quot;to take suchactions . . . as may be necessary to ensure compliance.&quot;   The resolution condemning Iraq's slaughter of the Kurdsnotes &quot;a massive flow of refugees toward and acrossinternational frontiers and to cross-border incursions, whichthreaten international peace and security in the region.&quot;There is wide agreement that this resolution carries animplicit threat to use force to stop Iraq's destruction ofthe Kurds. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said asmuch over the weekend.   Mr. Bush and his representatives regularly cite the scopeof the U.N. resolutions as reason to believe that the effortto pacify Iraq will go forward and succeed. But in his speechat Maxwell Air Force Base Saturday, Mr. Bush said our&quot;objectives, sanctioned by international law, have beenachieved&quot; and our troops are coming home. Do our objectivesencompass the explicit aims of Resolution 687 regarding thedestruction and monitoring of Iraq's war-making machinery?Unless the Baath Party believes that the U.S. is willingultimately to impose Resolutions 687 and 688, just as itimposed the earlier resolutions, this effort will fail. Inthat case, the extraordinary exercise in collective actionled by George Bush -- first with his remarkable Coalition,then with this unprecedented United Nations effort atpacifying a pirate nation -- will turn hollow.   It is a good bet that George Bush does not mean for hisname to enter history as a naive blunderer or worse. Now withIraq, he is calling on the United Nations to become a primaryinstrument of his new world order. With muscular Americanleadership, as in the war, it may work. Without it, the U.N.,like the Kurds, will likely fail. The world is about to learnif Mr. Bush is serious about all this.</TEXT></DOC>
