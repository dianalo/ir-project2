Five minutes later, it was quiet.   Charles H. King, minister, civil rights activist and formerprofessor, had just told the whites they are the reason racismthrives in America.   They were clearly offended.   Before long, a furious black woman lunged at an argumentativewhite man two feet away. The air rang with teary curses from thewoman and shouts from King.   The races were separated, shaken blacks shuttled into anotherroom where some cried. Equally shaken whites discussed what they sawand why they did not intervene on the woman's behalf. Some werebeginning to believe King was right.   Then came illustrations of the Black Man's Raw Deal in slides,recordings and diagrams on a blackboard.   In the end, everybody came out smiling, agreeing with the Kingtheory: bigotry reigns because (1) white people let it, (2) theywant it that way and (3) black people are all but powerless againstit.   Companies are sending executives and office managers to racerelations seminars, hoping to create understanding that can beapplied in the workplace. The workshops also have found their wayinto courts: Ku Klux Klansmen agreed to a seminar as part of thesettlement of a lawsuit stemming from a 1979 clash between Klanmembers and black civil rights marchers in Alabama.   King has been at it for 20 years, and has instructed at least 28others on his technique to send it into companies across the country.   Generally, the workshop puts people on uncomfortable chairs inuncomfortable rooms for anywhere from four hours to two days,forcing frank, often heated discussion of what racism is and isn't.   ``I had no idea of what the black person experiences,'' saidRobert Miskimins, a white sales executive for Chicago-based InlandSteel. ``Now, I think more black, because I'm more aware of whatblacks feel.''   ``It reaffirmed my blackness. It made me feel good about me,''said Linda Eastman, one of Miskimins' co-workers. ``It made me feelbetter able to articulate my feelings in an intellectual way.''   Inland sent 19 employees, mostly from its sales department, toKing's workshop. One black sales executive, Oliver Copeland, said hehopes to learn King's technique in order to start an in-houseprogram by 1990.   The workshops aim to enlighten whites through oppression. Thereare no apologies from King, who pioneered the technique in 1968during an angry moment in a all-white class he taught at an Ohiocollege.   ``They were just arguing back with me. And I really gave them allthe feeling and anger I had. No matter what you say, if it's to ablack person's favor and a white person's detriment, they alwaysargue back.   ``When you directly approach a white person with emotion, theybegin feeling, for the first time in their lives, what blacks aresaying.''   The Rev. C.T. Vivian, a civil rights activist who learned hisworkshop technique from King, said demand for his 14-year-oldseminar rose meteorically after it was dramatized on ``The OprahWinfrey Show'' this year. ``They saw something that worked. Peopleare concerned about racism but they just don't want to talk about itbecause they feel it's useless to talk about it.''   Vivian's Black Action Strategies andamp; Information Center workshopbooked solid through January 1990 and already has March dates.   King, who has run seminars for federal agencies ranging from theDefense Department to the FBI, will do one for the Navy in Germanylater this year. His pace has been slowed by recent cancer surgerybut he's booked through the year.   ``They're vying for space,'' he said. ``I have to turn peopledown now.''   Both workshops teach that discrimination and prejudice toward oneblack affects all blacks; that blacks often undergo racial identitycrises when they are placed in a white environment; that whites areprejudiced because of what they were taught and blacks because ofthe way they've been treated; and that whites profess to be ignorantof racism in order to avoid it.   Participants arrive thinking they may not like what they hear.   They're often not wrong.   ``There is no reason for a white male to not succeed in thiscountry,'' King shouted during a recent workshop. ``What do you haveholding you back? You're not black; you're not women.''   ``We all can't be president,'' one white participant said.   King whirled in anger.   ``Don't get smart with me. Don't try to change the subject, moveit to that level. That ain't what we're talking about.''   Inland Steel's Edna West was arguing with a white co-worker whenshe branded ``all white people'' with an obscene description.Another man in the workshop intervened, and so did King.   ``Don't interrupt an angry black woman! Don't try to stop blackanger! What do you want to stop her for?''   Ms. West said afterward that the confrontation ``showed me Ishouldn't just sit back and silently condone what they continue todo.''   King asked blacks to describe what it is like to work in amajority white situation. They spoke of isolation, despair, dashedhopes for promotions.   King said ``any progressive-thinking businessman'' would want tocombat those feelings because ``that's a stick of dynamite in yourpersonnel file.''   For that exact reason, an Atlanta business forum, LeadershipAtlanta, has been sending participants to King's Urban Crisis Inc.workshops for 13 years, said spokeswoman Elaine Alexander. About 800of the 1,200 executives who have gone through Leadership Atlantaalso went through King's workshop.   ``Virtually everyone who participates in one of Dr. King'sseminars is changed by it,'' Alexander said. ``It's a very emotionalexperience. It enhances their sensitivity toward the totalcommunity.''   Eighty-six percent of business participants and 94 percent fromcolleges said in follow-up surveys by BASIC that the seminars hadchanged their outlooks on race, Vivian said.   ``It's a beautiful thing to see, man. Black people say, `Yeah,we've seen 'em change here, but how long is it going to last?' Butup to 94 percent effectiveness? On an issue as deeply emotional asthis?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Sept. 25</NOTE></DOC>
