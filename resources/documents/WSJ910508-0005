The expected buyer is Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, theFrench oil company, which has been shopping for North Seaproduction properties to pair with its already abundantexploration acreage in the region.</LP><TEXT>   Proceeds of about $1.2 billion are expected, althoughanalysts said the sale could bring as much as $1.5 billion toLos Angeles-based Occidental, which has said it will sell atleast $3 billion of company assets by the end of next year,using the proceeds to pay down a like amount of corporatedebt.   Analysts said speculation about a sale, which began aboutfour weeks ago, surged yesterday, pointing to an announcementsoon. Neither company would confirm the speculation. Peoplein investment circles speculated that the announcement couldcome as early as today or might be held until Occidental'sannual meeting tomorrow or a session with analysts on Friday.   The transaction, combined with the company's $691 millionsale of a half interest in its U.S. natural gas liquidsbusiness announced earlier this week, could in two strokesremove Occidental's direct ownership of about one-quarter ofits production capacity of crude oil and natural gas liquids,resulting in a far different company than the one left whenArmand Hammer, Occidental's nonagenarian chief executive diedin December.   &quot;A sale of the North Sea properties would be pretty muchselling the growth prospects for Occidental's oil and gasoperations,&quot; said Michael Young, an analyst at Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co. The North Sea, with its vast networks ofpipelines and reasonably well-understood geology, isconsidered one of the most attractive exploration regions inthe world. Tax changes also have made more attractive somepreviously uneconomic oil discoveries, boosting activity.   Occidental's slimmer petroleum operations would includeits still-large natural gas production in the U.S. andrelatively smaller output of crude in various places,including the U.S., Peru, Argentina, and Pakistan.   Since its January pledge to sell assets and trim its $8.8billion in debt, Occidental has sold about $750 million inoperations, resulting in net after-tax proceeds of about $500million. The North Sea holdings are expected to be the mostvaluable single asset up for sale.   Investors yesterday appeared to differ on Occidental'sprospects, with volume of about 1.5 million shares incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The pricewas little changed, rising 37.5 cents to close at $19 ashare.   A transaction of this type for Elf Aquitaine, in which theFrench government holds about a 56% stake, would addproduction operations that would help finance and offset thecompany's already-active exploration program in the NorthSea. Under president and chief executive officer Loik LeFloch Prigent, Elf Aquitaine has become an increasinglyaggressive company, boosting its presence in both theproduction and marketing sides of the business.   A sale would also remove one of the major operators fromthe British sector of the North Sea, where Occidental ownsabout 132 million barrels of known crude oil and gas-liquidsreserves. The company's production in the area has beensharply reduced since a July 1988 explosion that destroyed agiant production platform in the Piper field, killing dozensof workers. Occidental's share of production from its workingNorth Sea fields is averaging about 23,500 barrels a day.   If it proceeds with a purchase, Elf Aquitaine wouldpresumably have to make major outlays on its new properties.Occidental is planning to spend about $800 million toredevelop the Piper field. The company also has planned todevelop the smaller Saltire field. By 1994 production fromNorth Sea properties is expected to reach about 70,000barrels daily.   A sale of the North Sea properties would underscore theplans of Ray R. Irani, Occidental's chairman, president, andchief executive officer, to put his own imprint on thecompany.   Long before Dr. Hammer's death, as the heir apparent, Mr.Irani expanded the company's chemical operations andintroduced a doctrine that Occidental will focus oncommodities in which it would be a major player in themarket. The open question is just how much of the petroleumoperations Mr. Irani plans to retain.   While Mr. Irani hasn't said that he plans to sharplyreduce oil and gas operations, &quot;his actions speak louder thanwords,&quot; said Mr. Young of Smith Barney.   Since Dr. Hammer's death, Mr. Irani has shown awillingness to sell once-sacred cows, including Occidental's51% stake in IBP Inc., the giant meat processor thataccounted for about $9 billion of Occidental's $20.07 billionin revenue but only a tiny portion of its profit. That salemight fetch anywhere between $700 million and $1.2 billion,analysts have said, and is presumably the next big item onthe block. However, Occidental's efforts to sell its IBPinterests in Japan have apparently failed to date.   Occidental's giant Midcon Corp. natural gas pipelineoperation, acquired in 1986 for $2.6 billion in cash andstock, has produced a string of mediocre profits and isthought by some to be a candidate for disposition. However,Mr. Irani has hinted that he's inclined to keep theoperation.</TEXT></DOC>
