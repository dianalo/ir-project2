Some famous initial public offerings, like Microsoft Corp.in 1986, have soared more than twentyfold in value. But othernew issues have produced nearly total losses for investors.</LP><TEXT>   Veteran stock-pickers note that there is no perfect way toidentify winners. Nevertheless they cite several steps thatcan help investors improve their odds. Most involve a carefulreading and analysis of information in the roughly 60-pageprospectuses that companies must issue before going public.   &quot;The prospectus is a gold mine of information if you knowhow to read it,&quot; declares Richard Spillane, director ofequity research at Fidelity Investments, the big Boston-basedmutual-fund company.   A good starting point, money managers say, is to compare acompany -- and its prospective stock-market valuation -- withsimilar companies that already have publicly quoted stock. Inthe first few pages of a prospectus, companies must discloseper-share earnings for the most recent 12 months, as well asa likely price range for a stock offering, such as $13 to $16a share.   Preston Athey, a mutual-fund portfolio manager at T. RowePrice Associates Inc. in Baltimore, says he recently analyzedCareNetwork Inc., a health-maintenance organization that wasabout to go public. He found that its price-earnings ratio(the prospective stock price divided by the company'sper-share earnings) was going to be about 12.5. That was wellbelow comparable companies that were already publicly traded,such as HMO America Inc., which has a P-E of 17. So Mr. Atheybought the stock.   A P-E ratio isn't the only way to value a stock, however.Some money managers prefer to look at a company's operatingprofit, which consists of earnings before taxes and interest.Others -- especially when looking at a small technologycompany with lots of promise but puny earnings -- will lookat price-sales ratios. Still, Mr. Athey says, &quot;you want tolook at comparable companies to the extent that you can.&quot;   A common next step is to calculate longer-term historicalgrowth trends for sales, operating profits and profitmargins. All those figures are provided in a prospectus,going back as far as five years. Brisk sales growth andsteady or rising profitability, obviously, are encouragingsigns, says Thomas Mitchell, an analyst at Weiss Peck andamp;Greer. Declining profitability, or cyclical swings, suggeststhat a stock is less appealing. Those calculations can play abig role in how high a P-E multiple investors are willing toaccept.   The credentials of a company's top management also drawinvestor attention. New York money manager William Churchsays that when he reads a biotechnology prospectus, he likesto see the company run by, say, a former research chief at agiant pharmaceutical concern. Mr. Church says he turns waryif the top executives' backgrounds are in venture capital, orin totally unrelated businesses, such as sporting goods.   Next on investors' checklists is a category known as &quot;riskfactors,&quot; or problem areas. Anyone scrutinizing the MustangRanch Inc. prospectus in 1989, for example, would havenoticed the company was embroiled in a big tax disputeconcerning whether the brothel's prostitutes were&quot;independent contractors&quot; or employees. The offering failed,and the government ultimately seized the brothel's assets.While most companies' problems aren't so lurid, they caninclude big potential losses in lawsuits, environmentaldisputes or cancellations of orders.   &quot;We look at all the disclosures very carefully,&quot; saysJeffrey Diermeier, head of equity investments at BrinsonPartners. &quot;Individuals should, too.&quot;   New-issue specialists say investors should also look forissues being brought to market by underwriters with strongtrack records. A history of IPOs that have performed wellafter regular market trading began is a positive signal, theysay.   Finally, investors should ask how the proceeds of a stockoffering will be used. Generally, money managers like publicissues that raise cash for business expansion; they aretolerant but less excited about initial offerings that useproceeds to pay off debt.   &quot;What gets you nervous is if it looks like management iscashing out,&quot; says Mr. Diermeier. &quot;You don't want anentrepreneur who views an IPO as the end of the process andsays: `Now I don't have to work so hard.'&quot;   After all, investors buying the stock regard the IPO as abeginning, not an end.   ---         Five Questions IPO Investors Should Ask                                                                                                          HOW DOES THE P-E RATIO COMPARE?   Almost any new issue can be compared with stocks alreadytrading. A common gauge is the price of a stock divided byits per-share earnings for the past 12 months. Thisprice-earnings ratio shouldn't be out of line with P-E ratiosat comparable companies. For a young technology company withscanty earnings, check the ratio of the total offering priceto annual sales.                                                                                                          HOW STRONG ARE PROFIT MARGINS AND GROWTH PROSPECTS?   Veteran investors look at a company's profit marginsbefore tax and interest, as a percentage of sales. Stable orrising margins are welcome; falling or cyclical margins meanthe stock will be less attractive. Historic trends in salesgrowth are important, too, as is an estimate of the company'sfuture growth.                                                                                                          ARE THERE ANY &quot;TROUBLE SPOTS&quot; IN THE PROSPECTUS?   By law, prospectuses must disclose any potentially&quot;material&quot; problems at a company, such as large disputes withthe IRS about unpaid taxes, a toxic-waste liability or anantitrust suit. Such disclosures usually are couched inoblique, lawyerly language. But they are there to be found,sometimes in a section labeled &quot;risk factors.&quot;                                                                                                          WHAT IS THE UNDERWRITER'S TRACK RECORD?   No underwriter is perfect. But some have reasonably goodlong-term records in pricing their IPOs and supporting themin subsequent trading. Others have dumped a lot of duds onthe market. Looking at an underwriter's recent offerings canbe a clue as to how a new issue might fare.                                                                                                          WHAT WILL THE PROCEEDS BE USED FOR?   Most veteran investors prefer IPOs that will finance apromising company's expansion plans. Some highly leveragedcompanies instead use proceeds to pay down debt, a choicethat draws mixed reviews. What the pros don't like is asituation where the company's main owners are cashing out byreducing their stockholdings.</TEXT></DOC>
