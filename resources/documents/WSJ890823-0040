But two top insiders have sold most of their shares in the industrial-coatings and plastics maker.    Werner Bush, group vice president in charge of the Cleveland company's coatings and colors division, sold 66% of his stake in two separate transactions July 31, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Bush, who got a total of $372,417 for 8,007 shares, declined to comment.    John W. Slaton, senior vice president of corporate development, sold 12,000 shares for $60 each, or $720,000, on Aug. 11. He has 474 shares remaining. Mr. Slaton, age 65, said he will be retiring from the company at the end of the month, but declined to comment further.    Ferro stock closed at $61 a share yesterday, up $2.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock price has nearly doubled since mid-March, when the company became the subject of takeover speculation. Lately, there's been persistent talk that Centaur Group or a group of investors led by Oppenheimer andamp; Co. will seek control of the company. The rumors have made for big gains, boosting the stock as much as $3 in a single day.    Ferro has been seen as an attractive takeover target because of its large presence in Europe, and the company's dominant market share in several of its plastics and coatings businesses, said Karen Lane, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. But so far, all the takeover talk has been just that, she said.    Moreover, she said, there are reasons to be bearish on Ferro. &quot;In general, they've had several years of exceptional earnings growth,&quot; she said. But currency exchange rates are working against Ferro, she said, and the tile-coatings market, in which Ferro is a major player, is leveling off. Ms. Lane predicts a decline in earnings in the fiscal year ending in December and for the next fiscal year.    Said Hector R. Ortino, the company's chief financial officer, &quot;We don't comment either on rumors or on unusual stock activity.&quot;    ---   DIAMONDS ON THE SOLES OF HIS SHOES? Nike Inc. Chairman P.H. Knight sold 200,000 shares, or a third of his Class B common, between July 18 and 25, for $8.7 million. But Mr. Knight, who has been a frequent seller of Nike shares, is still the majority stockholder of this Beaverton, Ore., maker of athletic footwear. He retains 13.5 million shares of Class A common and 404,799 shares of Class B common, said a spokeswoman for the company.    &quot;He's still the guy that calls the shots,&quot; the spokeswoman said. Mr. Knight declined to comment on his use of proceeds from the sale.    In over-the-counter trading, Nike stock closed yesterday at $47.50, up 12.5 cents.    ---   M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-N-E-Y: The sale topping this week's insider chart was by Frank G. Wells, president and chief operating officer of Walt Disney Co. As previously reported, he sold 850,000 Disney shares July 18 and 19 at a market price of about $101.60, or a total of $86.4 million. A spokesman for the company said Mr. Wells chose to sell the shares &quot;for estate planning and tax purposes.&quot; Mr. Wells made a profit of $74.2 million.    Disney stock closed yesterday at $114.25, down 75 cents, in trading on the Big Board.    ---   G. Pascal Zachary in San Francisco contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
