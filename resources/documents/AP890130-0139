The 181-page book, compiled by the private American Council onEducation, is meant to help colleges and universities bolster theirminority student and faculty populations at a time when blackenrollment is stagnating.   ``This is the first time we've put together a comprehensiveapproach. Our role is trying to set an agenda,'' said the council'spresident, Robert Atwell. ``Many, many institutions around thecountry are addressing this problem... At the same time, others outthere are really looking for help.''   The hardcover book, called ``Minorities on Campus: A Handbook forEnhancing Diversity,'' says that the last several years ``havebrought a disturbing increase of racially and ethnically motivatedviolence and conflict on campuses across the country.''   Atwell said the absence of role models, instances of outrightracism and ``so much indifference'' among students too young to havelived through the civil rights movement combine to create majorproblems on some campuses.   A campus climate can be overtly hostile but the problems are morelikely to be subtle, the handbook says. ``Minority students oftenfeel marginal, conspicuous and isolated from the mainstream of theinstitution,'' it says.   The book says universities should demonstrate a commitment toethnic diversity through hiring practices, reward systems and theinclusion of minorities in all phases of campus life. And it warnsadministrators to ``pay attention to symbols,'' such as Confederateflags and fraternity slave auctions, that minority students may finddeeply offensive.   The book says institutions should examine the racial makeup oftheir governing boards, faculty, senior and mid-level administrationstaffs, department chairmen and unit heads, professional staff,support staff and undergraduates.   The book goes on to discuss how to recruit minority students andfaculty members and how to make campuses more hospitable to minoritygroups.   The book says college presidents must set the tone for theircampuses, and with actions as well as words.   ``I hope that this document is on the shelf of every universitypresident in America today,'' Cavazos said at a briefing on thebook. ``If the leadership doesn't come from the top, it's not goingto happen. So I would say to my colleagues, to college presidents,`Pay attention.'''   The council, a private group representing the nation's collegesand universities, released the handbook a week after issuing areport citing a substantial drop in black male enrollment andcontinued slim representation of other minority groups amongstudents, teachers and administrators.   The best way to assure minority students' success is to ``build acritical mass of minorities on campus'' of about 30 percentenrollment, the book says. It acknowledges that is not a realisticgoal for most institutions but offers suggestions to bolster theminority presence on campus. Among them:   _Develop a recruiting plan that reaches to the elementary schoollevel and views adults as prospective students as well.   _Consider grades, community service, leadership record, essaysand interviews in addition to test scores as part of the admissionsprocess.   _Help minority students apply for admission and financial aid.   _Provide more work-study programs and fewer loans to minoritystudents, and offer budget counseling and emergency loan services toneedy students.   In the past decade the balance of student financial aid hasshifted from mostly grants to mostly loans, with grants nowaccounting for about 40 percent of federally sponsored aid, asopposed to 83 percent 10 years ago, according to the organization.Cavazos has said he wants to reverse the trend but cautioned Mondaythat ``you're not going to turn around that issue overnight with thebudget restraints we face. We have to be realistic.''   Overall college enrollment increased from 11 million to 12.5million from 1976 to 1986. but black male enrollment dropped by34,000 students, from a 4.3 percent share to a 3.5 percent share.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS NOTE: Copies of the handbook are available for $17.50each from the American Council on Education, Publications-DepartmentM2, One Dupont Circle NW, Washington D.C. 20036.
