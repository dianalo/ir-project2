John T. Hanes, formerly the president and chief executiveof Doskocil's Wilson Brands division, succeeded LarryDoskocil, the founder of the Hutchinson, Kan., maker of pizzatoppings and the engineer of the 1988 Wilson takeover thateventually plunged his company into unserviceable debt andthe Chapter 11 filing.</LP><TEXT>   The emerging company may confuse the issue of who tookover whom in the $133 million leveraged buy-out. Now, withformer Wilson management in place, Doskocil, under any name,looks pretty much like the old Wilson. About $150 million to$200 million of the company's sales are from former Doskocilbusinesses while more than $600 million is attributable toWilson's former business.   Further, Mr. Hanes and much of the company's managementlive and work in Oklahoma City, the former headquarters ofWilson. Doskocil is based in Hutchinson. Even the name may bechanged back to Wilson, a move that would require shareholderapproval.   The decision by Doskocil's new board to stick with Wilsonmanagement reflected &quot;that we have a seasoned, hardenedmanagement team that has successfully experienced adversityand grown the business through that adversity,&quot; said Mr.Hanes.   Mr. Hanes said the company will hold its first strategicplanning meeting in two weeks. He expects the focus of thestrategy will be &quot;adding value&quot; and continuing growth in thecompany's current meat product categories, especiallydelicatessen meats and pizza toppings. The nation's deli meatbusiness is growing about 16% a year and the pizza toppingsmarket is growing about 10% annually.   Doskocil has decided to hold onto its retail meatbusiness, which includes its ham, sausage and luncheon meatsales, and its one remaining hog slaughtering plant, Mr.Hanes said. It was the company's inability to sell thatdivision that was blamed for its Chapter 11 filing in March1990. Doskocil had planned to use proceeds of the sale toreduce its debt.   Through the restructuring, Doskocil has increased itsmarket share in boneless hams and in retail sausage, whichincludes frankfurters, luncheon meats and smoked sausage.Doskocil also has retained its leading position as thenation's largest deli meats company, Mr. Hanes said.   Under the Doskocil plan, which was approved by a Topeka,Kan., bankruptcy judge in late September, holders of $125million in subordinated debt, which carried 14.5% coupons,received 92% of the stock of Doskocil. Interest payments onthe $150 million in bank debt was reduced to 1.5 points abovethe prime rate from three points above prime. The bank debtwas restructured into an $80 million seven-year term loan and$70 million in revolving credit. Mr. Doskocil retains about1.3% of the stock of the company.   The restructuring will reduce the company's annualinterest payments on debt to about $15 million, said chieffinancial officer Theodore A. Myers. Before the Chapter 11filing, the company's debt payments had exceeded $35 millionannually, he said.   The company is projecting earnings in the second half of1991 to be about $8.3 million on sales of $417 million. Inthe first six months of 1991, the company reported a net lossof $13.5 million, or $2.64 a share, on sales of $410.9million. For 1992, the company is projecting net income of$14 million on sales of $837.7 million.</TEXT></DOC>
