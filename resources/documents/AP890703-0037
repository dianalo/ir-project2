In announcing its platform on Sunday, the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization, known as SWAPO, also pledged to improve thelot of the impoverished black majority and to champion socialism.   ``SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority ofsocialism over capitalism,'' the group's campaign manifesto said.   With banners waving, about 25,000 people, almost all black,attended SWAPO's first official campaign event Sunday in thefour-month campaign for elections that are to lead to independence.   ``This is the beginning of victory,'' SWAPO spokesman DannyTjongarero told the crowd at a community center in Katutura, a blacktownship outside Windhoek, the capital.   SWAPO's platform is generally kind to opposition groups, such asthe 75,000 whites who make up just 6 percent of the population butown the majority of private land and businesses.   ``No wholesale nationalization of the mines, land and otherproductive sectors is envisaged in the foreseeable future,'' saidHage Geingob, the leader of SWAPO's election campaign.   In the election, SWAPO is widely favored to win the most votesand possibly the two-thirds majority needed to control the writingof a new constitution.   Sunday's crowd, dressed in the red, blue and green colors ofSWAPO, frequently broke into song and chants of ``SWAPO Must Win!''Many supporters wore T-shirts with the face of SWAPO leader SamNujoma, who has yet to return from more than 20 years in exile.   Despite the pledges against nationalization, SWAPO's platformalso advocates a strong government role in shaping and controllingthe economy.   Geingob said the organization's main objectives were to close thegap between wealthy whites and impoverished blacks and to upgradebasic services such as education, health care and housing.   He did not say where the money would come from.   South Africa, which has provided up to 25 percent of theterritory's $700 million budget in recent years, says it will ceaseits aid when the territory gains independence, probably early nextyear.   The South Africans, who have ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed togrant independence under a peace plan signed in December with Cubaand Angola.   The U.S.-brokered accord calls for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000soldiers from Angola, where they have been supporting the Marxistgovernment. The Cuban pullout has been proceeding on schedule, andlast month Angola and the U.S.-backed rebels there agreed to acease-fire in their 14-year civil war.   SWAPO said it did not want to create a one-party communist state.It called for a democratic state with a bill of rights that wouldguarantee freedom of religion in the mostly Christian territory of1.3 million people.   It did not say whether it would tolerate political opposition andpress freedom.   SWAPO's main political rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,says it fears SWAPO will crack down on opposition groups if it gainspower. The alliance is a multiracial coalition that favors amultiparty democracy and a market-oriented economy.   SWAPO draws its strongest support from the Ovambo people ofnorthern Namibia and also has a solid base in Windhoek.   Political parties have been campaigning for several weeks, butthe weekend marked the formal start of the campaign. More than 4,000U.N. personnel are in Namibia to supervise the independence process.   Voter registration begins Monday. An estimated 500,000 peoplewill be eligible to participate in the elections, according toofficials.</TEXT></DOC>
