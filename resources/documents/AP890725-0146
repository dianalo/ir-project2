David Goerlitz, who portrayed a member of a search-and-rescueteam in a long-running ad campaign, said he considers himself ``anaccessory to the systematic poisoning of our society.''   ``I have had children tell me that they smoked Winstons so thatthey could be just like me,'' Goerlitz told the House Energy andCommerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials.``For that I shall always feel guilty.''   Goerlitz described himself as a 25-year, three-pack-a-day smokerwho kicked the habit in November and now speaks out against smokingfor the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association andAmerican Heart Association.   The legislation he endorsed would strip billboards and printedads of everything but words and ban tobacco ads from all sportsfacilities. The bill sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, is sobroad that it would outlaw the names of cigarette brands painted onrace cars.   The advertising industry said Tuesday that the restrictions, ifenacted, could cost thousands of jobs.   The Freedom to Advertise Coalition released a study itcommissioned saying that 62,992 jobs _ mostly in printing,publishing, advertising and retail trade _ would be lost if theproposed restrictions become law.   Publishers, ad industry and tobacco industry groups also arguedthat imposing more restrictions would violate First Amendmentguarantees of free speech and wouldn't necessarily reduce thenumber of youngsters who take up smoking.   Charles Whitley, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said thelegislation ``rests on the false premise that cigarette advertisingis responsible for smoking by young people and that young peoplewould not begin smoking if cigarette advertising were banned.''   ``We are convinced that the measure would do nothing to reducesmoking among young people,'' Whitley testified. ``In the name ofprotecting children, (the bill) would eliminate from tobaccoproduct advertising everything that makes it noticeable to adults.''   Bruce Flye, chairman of the National Tobacco Council, saidgrowers believe their product should be accorded the samereasonable advertising and promotional rights accorded any otherlegal commodity.   ``While protecting America's freedoms too many tobacco farmfamily members have fought, bled and died in too many wars ... tostand idly by while the United States Constitution is turned on itshead,'' he said.   A tobacco-state lawmaker, Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said hisconstituents don't understand why Washington denies them prayer inpublic school, allows the burning of the U.S. flag and persists inattacking the tobacco industry with ``punitive legislation.''   He said people in his district complain ``it's not what you'redoing for them, it's what you're doing to them.''   Tallon also warned that the restrictions would set a badprecedent.   ``Censorship is contagious,'' he said.   Congress passed a law in 1965 requiring the U.S. SurgeonGeneral's warning about the hazards of smoking to be put oncigarette packages and ads. The warnings began appearing in 1972after the tobacco industry and the Federal Trade Commission reachedan agreement on the wording.   Luken said his bill is needed ``to eliminate hucksterism in theselling of a product that the Surgeon General says kills 390,000Americans each year and is addictive in a way similar to drugs suchas heroin and cocaine.''   Goerlitz said he was told young people were the intended marketfor the ads in which he was featured along with then-unknown actorCorbin Bernsen and other men.   ``When I modeled for Winston, I was told very clearly that youngpeople were the market we were after,'' he testified. ``The othermodels and I were depicted as young and daring buddies, and that'swhat young people relate to at 14 or 15 years old.''   ``Kids did not want to be construction workers any more. Theywanted to be heroes,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
