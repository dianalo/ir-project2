He told the 44th General Assembly he will formally propose thecease-fire at a meeting with the rebel Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front in San Jose, Costa Rica, on Oct. 16-17, ``becausethe suffering must be brought to an end once and for all.''   Cristiani invited all political factions in El Salvador to jointhe current government. He said his administration would discussguarantees of security for the FMLN.   After his speech, he told a news conference the rebels' interestin political negotiations is partly due to Moscow's reluctance tocontinued funding of guerrilla movements worldwide.   About 70,000 people have died in the civil war.   Cristiani's rightist ARENA party took office June 1 afterdefeating the incumbent, centrist Christian Democrats in elections.   The U.S.-backed government and the rebels held a first round ofpreliminary peace talks in Mexico City in September. They decidedthen to hold more meetings to seek a negotiated settlement of thewar.   The rebels announced on Sept. 22 that they would not extend an11-day truce that expired that day because the guerrillas felt thegovernment was not responding positively and was increasingrepression.   The rebels last week launched a nationwide offensive that killedor wounded 78 people.</TEXT></DOC>
