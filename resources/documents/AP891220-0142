Peru expressed outrageand recalled its Washington ambassador.   Venezeula summed up many reactions by saying it opposedNoriega's regime but condemned the U.S. military intervention.   The U.N. Security Council was considering Nicaragua's requestfor an emergency meeting to consider the U.S. intervention. At theU.N. meeting, Panama ``will demand that the United States withdrawits invading troops immediately,'' Rodriguez said.   The U.S. assault began about midnight Tuesday as forces attackedPanamanian military headquarters, which witnesses said wasdestroyed.   Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit aboutseven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at thePanamanian base Fort Cimarron, about 20 miles from the capital.   About 9,500 American troops from bases in the United States wereflown in to augment the 12,000 soldiers based in Panama.   Panama's Defense Forces has 15,000 men. Noriega also has armedcitizen ``Dignity Battalions.''   Noriega's main bodyguard, Lt. Asuncion Gaitan, spoke on nationalradio after dawn to say that Noriega was ``well and in a safeplace.''   ``Don't anyone give up your positions,'' he said. Gaitan thengave a series of messages using code names and instructions.   Fighting continued after dawn in Old Panama, just east of theMarriott, and in San Miguelito, a poor district northeast of thecity center.   The Panama Canal was closed at 1 a.m. because of the fighting,said Panama Canal Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon. He saidlandslides had caused the only previous closings in the waterway's75-year history.   Panamanian forces attacked the U.S. Embassy, causing lightdamage, and the area was secured by U.S. military personnel andvehicles about 4:30 a.m., said a U.S. Embassy spokesman speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The only TV channels operating were the U.S. military networkand a Panamanian station that displayed a Department of Defenseshield. Radio Nacional claimed that Defense Forces had shot down aU.S. helicopter.   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic andpolitical pressure since he was indicted on federal drugtrafficking charges in February 1988.   Bush was criticized for not ordering U.S. troops to help themutineers during the October coup attempt. American soldiersblocked some routes to Defense Forces headquarters, but not all,and Noriega loyalists rescued him.   On Friday, Noriega's rubber-stamp government declared thecountry was in a ``state of war'' with the United States and namedthe general head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, aU.S. Marine lieutenant was shot to death by Panamanians in whatAmerican officials called an unprovoked attack.   American troops in Panama had been on maximum alert andrestricted to base since the lieutenant was killed Saturday and anAmerican Navy couple was held and the woman threatened sexually.   On Monday, a U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanian policemanbecause he thought the man was about to draw a weapon, according tothe U.S. Southern Command.</TEXT></DOC>
