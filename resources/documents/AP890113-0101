Maj. Valeriano Martinho, an Angolan member of a commissionmonitoring the cease-fire between South Africa and Angola, toldjournalists visiting the area Thursday that monitoring posts had notbeen established in southeastern Angola.   He also said he believed South Africa was continuing to supplythe rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence ofAngola, through gaps in the border between Angola and the SouthAfrican-ruled territory of Namibia.   The rebels control the territory and their leader, Jonas Savimbi,said several months ago that he would attack any troops trying toenter the area.   Under a treaty signed Dec. 22, South Africa has agreed towithdraw from Namibia and allow it to become an independent nation,and Cuba has agreed to pull its troops out of Angola. South Africaand Angola also agreed to establish monitoring posts along theborder.   The negotiations did not include the Angolan rebels, who havereceived aid from South Africa and the United States in their13-year war with the Marxist Angolan government, which has beensupported by Cuban troops.   South Africa responded to Martinho with a statement that said themilitary had done ``everything and more that is required of it interms of all the agreements signed between South Africa, Angola andCuba.''   The statement said South Africa was prepared to establish themonitoring posts on its side of the border ``but is aware of thefact that the Angolan armed forces are experiencing difficulties''with the guerrillas.   ``The best possible solution to the problem'' would be for Angoloto negotiate with the rebels, the statement said.   Savimbi says his guerrillas are fighting for a government ofnational unity to be followed by free elections. The Angolangovernment has refused to negotiate with him.</TEXT></DOC>
