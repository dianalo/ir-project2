Gorbachev in Moscow.   ``The Soviets will not be persuaded by mere words,'' YuliEdelstein, a former Soviet labor camp inmate, said during a rallyfor Soviet Jews attended by about 200 people in Jerusalem.   Edelstein and other activists demanded that the United Stateslink trade agreements and scientific and cultural exchanges to thelevel of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union.   The activists also described Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,''or openness, as a public relations stunt that has not led to realimprovements for Soviet Jews.   ``More than 2 million Jews remain in one big labor camp _ theSoviet Union _and the door is still closed,'' said Moshe Arens, amember of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet and theright-wing Likud bloc.   Arens called on Reagan to use the level of Jewish emigration asa test for Soviet sincerity on other issues, such as arms control.   Shamir aide Avi Pazner said in a telephone interview that ``wehave seen very few (Soviet) changes,'' but added that Shamir wassatisfied with Reagan's efforts.   U.S. officials have said the plight of Soviet Jewry would be onthe summit agenda. Reagan was to meet Monday with a group ofprominent ``refuseniks,'' Soviet Jews denied permission to emigrate.   Refusenik Zeev Dashevsky told Israel army radio in a telephoneinterview from Moscow that he viewed his scheduled meeting withReagan as a sign that the president assigned importance to theissue.   ``We want to tell him that even though positive things have beendone in the past two years, basic problems remain and the situationis not good at all,'' said Dashevsky, who has been denied an exitvisa for the past 11 years.   Moscow has released several prominent Jewish activists fromprisons and labor camps in the past year. Last year, 8,011 Jewsleft the Soviet Union, the highest number since 1981.   The Soviet Union severed ties with Israel after the 1967 MiddleEast war during which Israel captured territory from Moscow's Araballies.   In the past year, the Soviets sent a consular delegation toJerusalem, and approved a reciprocal visit by Israeli diplomats.</TEXT></DOC>
