At news conferences in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban andGrahamstown, the men cited religious, moral and political reasonsfor their refusal to serve in the South African Defense Force. Mostof the men could face up to six years in prison if convicted ofavoiding military service.   ``The army is not defending South Africa as a whole, but isdefending the system of apartheid,'' said Etienne Marais, who wasin the army from 1980-2.   ``Thousands (of black South Africans) have been detained,tortured or died in what can only be called a civil war,'' saidMarais, 26, a psychology student at the University of theWitwatersrand in Johannesburg.   All white men in South Africa are required to perform two yearsof initial service, and after that, they are subject to annualcall-up camps that can last as long as three months.   More than 100 of the 143 men have not served any time in themilitary. The rest, including Marais, have served some of theirrequired service but vowed not do any more.   Several have served in Angola, where South Africa is fightingalongside rebels battling that country's Marxist government.   The men, who said they were not part of any organized movement,included doctors, lawyers, engineers, a nuclear physicist and ArmyCapt. Andre Zaaiman, who renounced his commission and said he wouldnot serve in the call-up camps if ordered to do so.   ``I'm not prepared to fight or die for apartheid,'' saidZaaiman, 28, a teaching assistant at the University of Cape Town.   ``I reconfirm my refusal to participate in any way in the SADFuntil the system of apartheid has been done away with completelyand until the SADF acts in the interest of all South Africans,'' hesaid.   The South African government no longer releases information onhow many men refuse orders to serve. In 1985, the last yeargovernment announced the figures, 7,589 men chose not to serve.   The End Conscription Campaign, which opposes mandatory militaryservice, has said the numbers are increasing due to the army'sinvolvement in Angola and in patrolling black townships in SouthAfrica.   The army sometimes arranges non-military government service formen who refuse to serve for religious reasons. However, themilitary refuses to provide alternative service for men objectingto service on moral or political grounds.   The group of military objectors called for non-military,non-government alternative service for men who did not want toserve in the SADF.   ``As loyal South Africans we wish to contribute to the buildingof a peaceful, non-racial and just society,'' the group said in astatement. ``We do not see serving in the SADF as a way ofcontributing to peace in our country.''   Last week, military objector David Bruce, a 25-year-olduniversity student, was sentenced to six years following a highlypublicized trial.   In March, Dr. Ivan Toms, who ran a health clinic in the blacksquatter camp of Crossroads outside Cape Town, was sentenced to 21months in prison for refusing to serve in a one-month call-up camp.   Military service by non-whites in South Africa is voluntary.</TEXT></DOC>
