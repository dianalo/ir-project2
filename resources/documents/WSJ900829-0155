The administration hasn't yet decided whether to endorsethis or other proposals on the list, which was produced bythe Energy Department and is circulating among otheragencies. A package could be unveiled as early as next week.</LP><TEXT>   The proposals are more substantive -- and controversial --than a set of steps the department announced earlier thismonth following the disruption of Mideast oil imports. Thatplan, which called for such measures as putting more air inautomobile tires and increasing car-pooling, was essentiallyignored by the White House and roundly dismissed asinadequate by conservation groups.   The latest proposals include renewing the administration'spush to persuade Congress to open up the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration and urgingconsumers to use gasoline with lower octane ratings. Theadministration also apparently plans to report progress inmediating a California environmental dispute that is blockingthe production of 200 million to 300 million barrels of oil.   In addition, the administration has said it will reproposevarious tax incentives for oil drilling that were included inits budget proposal last January. These include changes thatwould reduce the burden of the alternative minimum tax onproducers.   Such incentives, while strongly supported in the oilindustry, would face an uphill battle in this time ofswelling budget deficits. The tax changes aimed at theindustry in the budget were estimated to cost $300 million inthe fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   And while an alternative-energy tax credit could help makeany package more acceptable to environmental groups, it'scertain to draw fire from tax experts who contend that suchmeasures typically don't spur enough additional investment towarrant their steep budgetary cost.   Meanwhile, fears that the Mideast situation would lead toa renewed push on the Alaska wilderness have already touchedoff vigorous lobbying by environmental groups. The oilindustry, for its part, is likely to oppose steps to reducesales of its lucrative high-octane fuels, although EdRothschild, head of a Washington lobbying group on consumerand labor issues, contended that reducing the average octanelevel of all U.S. gasoline by a single point would save140,000 barrels of oil a day. Octane measures the anti-knockcapacity of gasoline.</TEXT></DOC>
