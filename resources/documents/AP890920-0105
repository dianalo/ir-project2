Sun-News on smoke-free flights:   The space in which the smokers of America can indulge theircraving keeps shrinking. Smoking is now banned in many publicbuildings. Private employers have banned it in office and workplace,or restricted it to certain areas.   Latest defeat for smokers, and the tobacco industry, came whenthe Senate approved a ban on smoking on all domestic airlineflights. The tide is clearly running against the tobacco habit.   America's propensity for proscribing bad habits doubtless tracesin part to the puritanism inherited from our early forefathers. Butpart is certainly attributable to the exceptional concern Americanshave with their health.   And, of course, we give a wide berth to anything that poses arisk of cancer. Tobaccos happens to be near the top of that list.That doesn't bode well for the tobacco industry.   Smokers are doubtless destined to become an ever-smaller minorityincreasingly subject to the displeasure of a vehement majority.Smokers may complain of the tyranny of the majority. But that's theAmerican way. The people impose the curbs on personal behavior. Thegovernment just ratifies them.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 16   Daily Tribune, Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., on smoke-free flights:   It was good to see the U.S. Senate stand up to the pressures ofthe tobacco interests and do something positive for Americans'health.   The Senate ... voted to ban smoking on all U.S. airline flights.The action is in the interest of health and safety.   Non-smoking sections on airplanes typically are in the same cabinas designated smoking areas, so the smoke can bother those who don'tcare to inhale it, and studies have pointed out the negative effectsof second-hand smoke.   There already is a temporary ban on cigarette smoking on alldomestic flights of two hours or less. That measure will expire inApril.   The House of Representatives last month passed a measure topermanently ban smoking on the flights of two hours or less.   Now, a Senate-House conference committee will attempt to work outa compromise. One would think that means the Senate should back downfrom the total ban. However, four-fifths of all domestic flights aretwo hours or less, so why not make the smoking ban easy to follow bysimply applying it to all flights?   Airline passengers can't step outside to get away from the smoke.They deserve to have clean air to breathe while they're locked up inthese aircraft.   In addition, banning all smoking would enhance fire safety on theplanes. One careless smoker can cause a lot of harm if a discardedcigarette starts a fire.   In an era when more Americans are trying to be health-conscious,it seems reasonable to make the skies smoke-free.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 13   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on TV commercials that offend:   Stroh Brewing Co. pledged $600,000 for National Audubon Societytelevision specials. But one show about harmful logging in thePacific Northwest _ ``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees'' _ causedNorthwest loggers to threaten a boycott of Stroh's beer.   The brewery announced it will ``review'' its funding of Audubonshows. A Stroh's spokesman said the decision wasn't related to theboycott threat _ that the company just wants to cut costs.   That's not credible. Stroh's ... is worried about offendingcustomers. The review is a sellout of the environmental movement. ...   Meanwhile, the other Audubon sponsor, maverick broadcaster TedTurner, still is paying his share for the controversial show,scheduled to air Sept. 24. Turner doesn't mind boycotts. In fact, heinvites them.   When anti-abortion groups protested a Turner Broadcasting Systemshow on a women's right to choose, he suggested that they watch adifferent channel.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 13   The State, Columbia, S.C., on the East German exodus:   The mass emigration of East German refugees to West Germany byway of Hungary is an extraordinary development that signals aradical shift in policy behind the Iron Curtain. Significantly, theexodus celebrates the free will of human nature and concedes thefallacy of authoritarianism and repression as effective tools ofgovernance. ...   Nobody really knows at this juncture how many East Germans willultimately cross over into West Germany. Some estimates go as highas 100,000 by the end of the year.   Taking note of that possibility, West German Chancellor HelmutKohl has urged East Germany's leaders to introduce the sort ofreforms that are being tried in Poland and Hungary. If life in EastGermany improved, he reasoned, more East Germans might stay at home.   Freedom-loving people everywhere watch and listen with cautiousapproval, mindful that in today's uncertain world of realpolitik andtrigger-happy turbulence, a populist celebration can change rapidlyinto a tragic hangover.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 15   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the defeat of EdwardKoch:   (New York City Mayor Edward) Koch's defeat at the hands of DavidDinkins ... has been treated in the press as something like thetriumph of good over evil.   That is not only unfair but untrue.   The man who began his political life as a Greenwich Villagereformer had scarcely lost sight of his Democratic orgins, orprogressive ideals; he had merely combined them with pragmatism andcommon sense that offended some observers.   So be it.   This interesting combination of liberal conservative policiespleased the voters of New York for three successive terms.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
