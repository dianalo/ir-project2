Of the three plant species, the rhizosphereof fourwing saltbush had significantly higher fungal populations thanthe rhizosphere of galleta or alkali sacaton 2.25 years after plant establishment.Although, the diversity of fungal groups in the rhizosphere and nonrhizospherezones of all three plant species generally increased with plant age,the diversity of fungal groups in the rhizosphere of all three plantspecies were still lower than in the nonrhizosphere soil. Higher fungalpopulations and lower fungal diversities were generally related to highernutrient contents in the rhizosphere, whereas lower fungal populationsand higher fungal diversities were generally related to lower nutrientcontents in the nonrhizosphere soil. Fungal groups changed between rhizosphereand nonrhizosphere zones, and among and within plant species as the ageof the plants increased Chrysosporium spp. dominated the rhizosphereand nonrhizosphere of all three plant species after 0.25 years. After2.25 years, Aspergillus spp. dominated the rhizosphere of both grassspecies, whereas Penicillium spp. dominated the rhizosphere of fourwingsaltbush.</TEXT></DOC>
