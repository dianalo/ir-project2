Bertrand, 46 years old, resigned as chief executive officer of its Greyhound Leasing andamp; Financial Corp. subsidiary.    The consumer products, food and financial services company named W. Carroll Bumpers, 65, group vice president for financial operations, to succeed Mr. Bertrand on an interim basis. Greyhound declined to disclose the reasons for Mr. Bertrand's resignation and didn't say when a permanent successor would be named. Mr. Bertrand couldn't be reached for comment.    Last month, Greyhound said it was restructuring its financial services unit to focus on real estate leasing instead of commercial equipment leasing. Greyhound dropped an earlier plan to sell the unit because changes in the tax law made it difficult to attract potential buyers. In addition, enhanced earnings prospects for the real estate segment of the leasing unit's operations triggered the decision to retain it.    The unit is the largest in Greyhound's financial services group, which contributed about 20% of the parent's $656.8 million in revenue last year. Greyhound took a write-off of $19 million against 1985 earnings for losses on loans made by the unit. Greyhound claims in a lawsuit that the loans were based on fraudulent collateral guarantees. </TEXT></DOC>
