The giant food and tobacco company, which is the biggestissuer in the junk bond market, filed a registrationstatement with the Securities and Exchange Commission tooffer 75 million shares of common stock. The company alsoplans to issue $750 million of senior notes on behalf of itsRJR Nabisco Capital Corp. unit. The proceeds from the twooffering will be used to repurchase and retire $1.5 billionof RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures that maturein 2007. Payment-in-kind securities pay interest in the formof additional securities, instead of cash.</LP><TEXT>   The news bolstered sentiment in the broader junk bondmarket because analysts expect other heavily indebtedcompanies to take similar steps. &quot;This gives the impressionthat companies will be less leveraged and more financiallyflexible,&quot; and better able to meet their debt payments in thefuture, said Robert Lupo, managing director of high yieldresearch at First Chicago Capital Markets.   RJR's 15% payment-in-kind subordinated debentures due in2001 jumped 3 1/8 points to 118 3/4 while the company'szero-coupon bonds added 1 3/8 points to 71 7/8.   But RJR's 17% bonds slipped 1/2 point to 107 3/4. Sincethe 17% debentures are callable at par plus accrued interest,traders said investors were reluctant to bid up the bondsbecause they are already trading slightly above theiraccreted value.   RJR Nabisco said that Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. will manage thecommon stock offering, along with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., MorganStanley andamp; Co., Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. and, in Europe, CreditSuisse First Boston. Merrill Lynch will manage the seniornote offering, along with Salomon Brothers Inc.   In reaction to the RJR news, prices of &quot;top-tier&quot; junkbonds jumped about 1 1/2 points higher, a gain of about $15for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Top-tier junk bonds ofcompanies like RJR are considered the healthiest and leastrisky within the junk bond market, although all junk bondsare defined as speculative-grade securities that have lowcredit ratings or no credit rating. Most middle-tier anddistressed-tier junk bonds rose just 1/2 point yesterday, inline with the broader bond market. The Treasury's benchmark30-year bond, for example, rose about 5/8 point.   Junk bonds have been the best-performing segment of thebond market all year, with an average total return of about17% since January 1, according to First Chicago CapitalMarkets. Total return measures price changes plus interestincome.   Among junk bond issues that were top performers yesterday,&quot;a lot of the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-related deals were upthe most,&quot; said Joseph Bencivenga, director and manager ofhigh-yield research at Salomon Brothers. Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co. is the investment firm that took RJR privatetwo years ago in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out. Mr.Bencivenga said that buyers of junk bonds are assuming that,like RJR, KKR will orchestrate similar financialrestructurings for other heavily indebted companies that ittook private through leveraged buy-outs.   That explains why the bonds of Owens-Illinois Inc. surged.The packaging company, which was taken private in an LBO byKKR in 1987, saw its split-coupon securities due in 2003 jumpsix points yesterday to a price of 69. The company's 14.5%payment-in-kind bond due in 2003 rose five points to 90.Earlier this week, Owens-Illinois reported strong financialresults.   RJR's debt retirement initiative is the latest piece ofgood news to hit the junk bond market. In the past twomonths, junk prices have been soaring due to announcementsand rumors of company debt restructurings, acquisitions andother events.   On Tuesday, for example, news that junk issuer DuracellInternational Inc. is planning to sell stock for the firsttime sparked gains in junk bond issues even as the U.S.Treasury and stock markets slumped.   Other big junk bond gainers yesterday were the zero-couponbonds of American Standard Inc., which makes plumbing andfixtures. The company's zero-coupon bonds rose 5 1/2 pointsto 58 on rumors that the company is raising money to buy backsome bonds, although a company official said that bank loanagreements and bond indentures currently preclude the companyfrom repurchasing its bonds in the open market.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          The Treasury market staged a moderate rebound fromTuesday's sharp drop as investors re-examined the latestconsumer price index and concluded that the report may haveoverstated inflationary pressures.   The Labor Department's report of a surprising 0.7%increase in the &quot;core&quot; inflation rate for February sparked asharp sell-off Tuesday. But Michael Strauss, chief economistat UBS Securities Inc., said some of the contributing factorsto that increase may have been spurious.   For example, the large increase reported in prices ofhotel lodging may have resulted from adjustments that failedto account for recent changes in the mix of propertiessurveyed, he said.   In trading yesterday, the benchmark 30year Treasury bondended at a price of 94 25/32 to yield 8.34%, compared with 945/32 to yield 8.40% Tuesday. The latest two-year notes endedat 99 8/32 to yield 7.15%, compared with 99 6/32 to yield7.18%. Rates on short-term bills were moderately lower.   Prices of short-term securities also were helped by theTreasury's announcement that it will cut the size of nextweek's two-year and five-year note auctions by $500 millioneach from the amounts sold last month.   The Treasury said it will sell $11.5 billion of two-yearnotes and $8.5 billion of five-year notes Tuesday andWednesday, respectively.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bonds bounced back after Tuesday's slide, withactively traded issues finishing 1/8 to 1/2 point higher.   Among actively traded bonds, the Salt River, Ariz., 6.5%securities of 2022 closed 1/8 higher at 91 7/8 as the yieldfell to 7.12% from 7.15% late Tuesday.   In relatively light primary market activity, Michigan's$500 million of general obligation notes, priced by aPrudential Securities Inc. group, saw good demand.   The notes, due Sept. 30, 1991, were repriced late in thesession as 5.25% securities to yield 4.60%. The yield wasdown 0.05 percentage point from the initial pricing.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-backed securities rebounded from recent declines,pulling prices of active issues as much as 9/32 higher.   The gains retraced a fraction of the losses of as much as1 3/8 point posted over the previous three days.   The 8.5% securities for April delivery from GovernmentNational Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. and Federal National Mortgage Association were all up9/32 on the day. Prices were 96 20/32, 96 15/32 and 96 9/32,respectively.   Primary market activity was again heated, with $1.2billion of real estate mortgage investment conduits in fourdeals. Freddie Mac issued a $390 million deal, Series Gold1069, backed by   Freddie Mac gold 9.5% securities and offered by Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. The agency's $300 millionSeries Gold 1071 was backed by Freddie Mac gold 8.5%securities and offered by Citicorp.   Fannie Mae's $200 million series FNMA G-9, backed byGinnie Mae 9.5% securities, was offered by Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. J.P.

Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          Despite widespread speculation that the Bank of Japan willsoon cut the discount rate, prices of Japanese governmentbonds slipped.   Japan's benchmark 10-year government bonds, the No. 1296.4% bond due in 2000, ended Tokyo Stock Exchange trading ata price of 98.78, down 0.20 point, to yield 6.615%. Whencalculated using the semiannual compound method, the yieldended at 6.58%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.   Traders attributed the decline to weakness in the yenagainst the dollar but said they expect the market to bounceback as interest rates decline. Yesterday's Nihon KeizaiShimbun, a daily newspaper, reported that senior leaders inthe ruling Liberal Democratic Party are &quot;requesting&quot; that theFinance Ministry and the Bank of Japan lower the discountrate. The rate last changed in August, when it was raised 3/4percentage point to 6%.   Bond prices were higher in most major European markets.German and French bonds were as much as 1/2 point higher.
