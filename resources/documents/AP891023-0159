(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker should repay up to $100million donated by his PTL followers as well as go to jail for hisfraud and conspiracy conviction, prosecutors said Monday.   ``Fraud in the name of a religious organization is conduct whichmust be deterred and punished,'' the prosecutors said in asentencing recommendation.   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 of 24 counts charging he defraudedfollowers of his television ministry, selling lodging guarantees athis Christian retreat when he knew rooms weren't available at hisinns. Followers sent more than $158 million for the lodging rights.   The jury found that Bakker used more than $3.7 million to buyluxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.   Bakker will be sentenced Tuesday at a hearing in U.S. DistrictCourt that is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. He faces 120 years inprison and a fine of more than $5.2 million.   Prosecutors filed the memorandum a day earlier with U.S.District Court Judge Robert Potter, whose penchant for stiffpenalties has earned him the nickname ``Maximum Bob.''   ``It appears unlikely the lifetime partners will recoup theirlosses through the bankruptcy proceeding,'' the memo said. ``As aresult the government urges that restitution be ordered by thecourt.''   A letter from lawyers representing the partners was attached tothe memo and said unsettled claims made on behalf of variouspartners would total between $90 million and $100 million.   In the sentencing memo, Justice Department fraud specialistDeborah Smith and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Potterthat Bakker be fined the maximum amount, which totals $5.23million, if restitution wasn't ordered.   Bakker couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney, HaroldBender, said the defrocked Assemblies of God minister was drivingfrom his Orlando, Fla., home to Charlotte.   Bender attached character references from Bakker supporters tohis three-page sentencing recommendation and urged the judge toconsider alternatives to prison.   Bender asked the court to ``consider reasonable alternatives andallow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion andmercy.''   The lawyer also said former PTL executive vice president RichardDortch, who was indicted with Bakker, received an eight year prisonsentence after pleading guilty.   ``It would appear the only difference between this defendant andthe co-defendant was that this defendant chose to exercise hisconstitutional right of trial by jury,'' Bender said.   Bender had no comment on the government's sentencingrecommendation and said he planned to meet Monday night with Bakker.</TEXT></DOC>
