He also brushed aside GOPstatements that the Democrats had effectively created a three-manticket that includes Jesse Jackson.   ``I don't think there's anything to it,'' he said.   Bentsen said he still might vote for new aid to the NicaraguanContras, despite Dukakis' opposition.   As for Dukakis opposing Bentsen's plan to impose an import oilfee, he joked, ``I haven't been able to convince George Busheither.''   Bentsen's comments came following a speech in Albuquerque to abusinesswomen's convention, in which he tied Bush to Reaganadministration policies opposed by feminists. Bentsen supports theEqual Rights Amendment and several other initiatives supported bythe women's group.   The campaign stop in Albuquerque was at the start of a four-daycross-country campaign swing, which continues with speeches todayin San Francisco and Reno, Nev. The campaign will then travel toLos Angeles; Amarillo, Texas; and a finale in either Lousiana orMississippi.   Events will be designed to highlight some of Bentsen'sdifferences with the GOP and not with Dukakis, such as thesenator's work on the trade and plant-closing notification bills,and of energy independence programs.   Bentsen's speech to the National Federation of Business andProfessional Women came just three days after Bush unveiled a $2.2billion child care plan before the same group.   ``It's interestng to me that it's taken eight years (for theRepublicans) to discover day care,'' said Bentsen. Just last year,he said, the White House fought ``every step of the way'' againstjust $50 million proposed for child care for poor women.   Bentsen himself has not endorsed a $2.5 billion Democratic daycare proposal, which won the approval Wednesday of the Senate Laborand Human Resources Committee.   But Bentsen told the group that the ``gender gap'' _ the patternof women supporting Democrats in greater proportions than men _ wasa direct result of the GOP record on issues including the equalrights amendment, equal pay and the law banning discrimination byinstitutions receiving federal money.   ``The Reagan-Bush administration opposes the ERA ... they rippedit out of the (Republican) platform,'' he said. ``They oppose thestudy that will provide the legal foundation for women who arediscriminated against to bring their case to court and win.''   Bentsen said Reagan's veto of the bill overriding the Grove Cityruling of the Supreme Court, which weakened federal anti-biasrules, showed ``this administration tried to compromise equality.... But we overrode that veto. And we scored a major victory forequality and opportunity in America.   ``The gender gap... wasn't created by accident,'' he said.   At the end of his speech, Bentsen was presented with a redpurse, the group's symbol of how women make less money forcomparable work.   ``By the end of the Dukakis-Bentsen administration,'' hepromised, ``this purse will be black.'' He received a standingovation from the 2,000 women in the convention hall, several ofwhom held up Dukakis-Bentsen campaign signs.   Bentsen supports pay equity legislation in Congress but not themore ambitious comparable worth legislation. He told reportersafter his speech he wanted to go one step at a time. He also saidhe had not yet endorsed maternal leave legislation and has not hadtime to study it.   The businesswomen's group, founded in 1919, has 125,000 membersnationwide, of which 51 percent list themselves as Republicans, 47percent Democrats and the rest independent, according to executivedirector Linda Dorian.   ``There was a lot of enthusiasm for Sen. Bentsen and what he hadto say,'' said Ms. Dorian. The group was conducting a straw polland planned to release the results today.</TEXT></DOC>
