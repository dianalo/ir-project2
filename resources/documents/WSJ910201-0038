The conference's 10-weekwinter session opened last week.   United Nations investigators say Iraq used poison gas inits eight-year war against Iran and against its ownpopulation. More recently, Baghdad has made thinly veiledthreats to use chemical weapons against Israel and theU.S.-led forces fighting Iraq over its Aug. 2 occupation ofKuwait.   Iran repeatedly used the Geneva conference to denounceIraqi use of poison gas.   The U.S. and the Soviet Union hold the biggest chemicalarms arsenals and are the only major countries admitting theyhave any.   The conference has been discussing a treaty banning theproduction, stockpiling and use of chemical weaponsworld-wide for 30 years.
