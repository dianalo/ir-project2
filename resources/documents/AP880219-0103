(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four infants in need of livers arebeing evaluated for transplant after a baby kept on life-supportsystems as a potential organ donor was declared brain dead, ahospital official said.   The brain-dead diagnosis for the 7-pound infant born Tuesday,was confirmed Thursday after examinations by three neurologists,said Joyce Peabody, chief of neonatology at Loma Linda UniversityMedical Center.   The boy's heart was beating, and a respirator supplied oxygen tohis organs, but he had no higher brain activity, she said. Thechild was born Tuesday.   The boy's condition, known as anencephaly, kills most babieswithin days after birth. Their healthy organs can be transplantedif organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants onlife-support.   The Southern California Organ Procurement Center would chooseorgan recipients, Ms. Peabody said. Liver and heart were the mostlikely organs for transplant, she said, adding that Loma Lindaofficials know of one baby in need of a heart but not of the rightblood type.   The names of the baby's parents were withheld to protect theirprivacy, but Ms. Peabody said the mother had expressed satisfactionwith the procedure.   The National Right to Life Committee, which accused Loma Lindaof going beyond prevailing medical ethics, denounced the procedure.Protesters said doctors at the hospital hadn't done enough toensure that organs weren't removed from live children.   However, Ms. Peabody said, the case may have answered severalmedical and ethical questions about the practice of maintaininganencephalics in order to use their organs.   It demonstrated that the baby didn't suffer discomfort ordistress, she said. It also indicated organs can be kept incondition suitable for transplant, and that the life-supportapparatus didn't artificially prolong the time until the babysuffered brain death.   One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year from adonor child in Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
