In interviews during the group's first international conference here, ANC officials said they planned to open a Washington office soon. The organization currently has one U.S. office, near the United Nations in New York.    Johnstone Makatini, director of the ANC's foreign department, said the organization wants anti-apartheid groups to push &quot;recognition of the ANC as the vanguard of the movement&quot; and the &quot;legitimate representative of the people of South Africa.&quot;    Mr. Makatini called for improving the diplomatic status of ANC representatives and for increased material support from friends around the world.    The ANC, which is banned in South Africa, hopes that such measures would work to diminish the Reagan administrations's view of the ANC as just one of several anti-apartheid groups. An international campaign for what Mr. Makatini called &quot;sole and exclusive recognition&quot; of the ANC as the leader of democratic forces seeking a new South Africa would aim to undercut support for other organizations like Inkhata, led by Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Chief Buthelezi has been received by President Reagan.    Raising the ANC's status also would weaken the Pan Africanist Congress. The PAC has little international support, but it enjoys status equal to the ANC at the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.    ANC officials insist that seeking to be the single representative of the South African people doesn't imply that a post-apartheid South Africa would be a one-party state. Alfred Nzo, the ANC's secretary-general, said his group is &quot;for everybody setting up a political organization,&quot; as long as it is not racially or ethnically based. The South African government doesn't allow mixed-race political parties.    The ANC's conference here was attended by about 500 people from 50 nations. The U.S. was represented by a first secretary from the American Embassy in Tanzania. </TEXT></DOC>
