(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Standing outside former Soviet leaderAndrei Gromyko's office while visiting the Kremlin last year,Randall Teague listened to a sound he hadn't heard in so long henearly couldn't recognize it.   It was the tap-tap-tapping of a manual typewriter.   ``I knew exactly what it was when I heard another old sound _ thesound someone makes when they're using six carbons in a typewriterand they make a mistake,'' said Teague, a Washington attorney forSmith Corona Corp., who specializes in international trade law.   ``If that's what one of the most powerful men in the country hadin his offices, I wondered what everyone else was doing,'' Teaguesaid in recalling the moment that spawned an idea for his client:peddling typewriters to Russia. In what company aides called anunusual deal, Smith Corona will sell a range of typewriters andportable word processors to Vneshtorgizdat, an official Soviet bookpublishing concern, to be paid for in U.S. dollars.   Vneshtorgizdat, also known as VTI, will then sell the machinesthroughout the Soviet Union, initially to universities, professionalwriters and for use in some offices, said Smith Corona President LeeThompson.   The arrangement exploits a new Soviet economic liberalizationpolicy, under which some Soviet companies that routinely earnforeign currency may keep part of the money to buy imports.   The policy went into effect in 1987, but is only starting to havesome impact because it was deferred for all of 1988 in most cases,said Ed Hewett, a Soviet economy expert at the Brookings Institutionin Washington.   ``These are not the kind of deals that make headlines, so it'shard to know how many there are,'' Hewett said. ``But I think we'llbe seeing a lot more of these deals in the first half of the year.''   On April 1, the policy will be expanded to include any Sovietcompany or even a region of the country that can earn foreigncurrency and wants to spend it.   ``Of course, the problem is most Russian companies don't haveproducts that they can sell to get foreign currency,'' said Hewett.   In VTI's case, it sells Soviet books around the world and earnsdollars, yen, marks, pounds and other foreign money.   In the past, Hewett said, companies like VTI would sell productsto an official Soviet foreign trade agency, which in turn would sellthe books and keep the foreign currency.   Under the old arrangement, if VTI wanted to import something, ithad to make a request and go through the foreign trade agency, whichgenerally would select where the product would come from and whatmodel or style it would be.   The Smith Corona deal was started when Teague, who specializes inrepresenting U.S. business interests in the Soviet Union, bumpedinto an old Soviet friend Vladimir Prokopov during a visit there inJanuary 1988.   In catching up on what was new in their lives, Prokopov toldTeague he headed VTI and wished to import typewriters and wordprocessors.   That discussion triggered a flurry of telexes, telephone callsand meetings over the course of the year, culminating with anagreement signed in January, Teague said.   ``It just happens to be one of those situations where twocompanies had a great fit and were able to work things out,'' saidThompson.   The deal is part of an an explosion in foreign demand for SmithCorona machines. Three months ago it signed an agreement with NVPhilips, a huge Netherlands-based electronics firm, to supplytypewriters throughout Europe.   Both developments indicate the continued rebound of Smith Corona,a subsidiary of the British conglomerate, Hanson Industries Ltd.   The company lost more than $100 million during the first half ofthe 1980s, consolidated from four plants to one and cut employmentfrom 5,000 to 850 at its low point in 1984.   Today, the company employs 2,150 people and has regaineddominance in the portable typewriter and word processor market. Thecompany does not disclose sales or profit figures.   The Soviet deal sent company engineers hurriedly to computers anddrawing boards to devise typewriters that use the Cyrillic alphabet,which contains 33 letters, almost all of them different from the26-letter Latin alphabet.   To Americans, the Cyrillic keyboard looks like a jumble ofunusual symbols and backward letters. It's arranged nothing like thestandard typewriter keyboard in the United States.   For instance, the Cyrllic ``A'' is located where the ``F'' wouldbe on a regular typewriter. The ``M'' is where the ``V'' is, and the``P'' is where the ``H'' is. Only the ``C'' is in the same place onboth keyboards.   ``That's just an extreme coincidence,'' said Ray Blanchard, SmithCorona's director of advanced products. He showed off the firstprototype Cyrillic model at the company's central New Yorkmanufacturing facility, noting the company's Smith Corona logotranslated into Russian in the upper lefthand corner.   It looked roughly like ``CMNT KOPOHA.''</TEXT><TEXT>   ``It's not a particularly difficult challenge from a keyboard andprint wheel standpoint,'' said Thompson in a telephone interviewfrom the company's headquarters in New Caanan, Conn. ``The difficultchallenge is the development of a Russain language spellchecker,dictionary and thesaurus.''   All Smith Corona's machines, except the basic model XL1500, havedictionary and spellchecker computerized memory devices built in,Blanchard said.   The company makes more than 200 models of typewriters and wordprocessors. Its most popular model is the XL1500, which costs about$140.   Thompson said the company expects to export Cyrillic typewritersto the Soviet Union by the end of this year.   Until then, however, the company will send typewriters and wordprocessors with Latin keyboards designed for use in Britain to VTI,which has said there's a substanial demand for the English-languagemachines.   The first shipment of three different models, nearly 1,000machines, is en route, said Blanchard, and the company is takingorders for the Cyrillic machines.   Thompson said there's a hodgepodge collection of old electric andmanual typewriters in the Soviet Union, including InternationalBusiness Machine Corp. models and some inexpensive East Germanmodels.   IBM created a Cyrillic typewriter ball for its Selectrictypewriters in the early 1970s, said company spokesman Tom Belz, butthe company does not conduct regular business in the Soviet Union.   Thompson said it's unclear how many typewriters Smith Corona mayeventually sell in the Soviet Union, partly because there's nomarket research about the country. The company is largely relying oninformation from VTI. He said that agency solicited interest from400 prospective Soviet customers last year.   ``In the United States, if you get 1 to 2 percent back, you'vedone a marvelous job. They got 50 percent back saying this is thetype of equipment they're interested in,'' Thompson said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 12</NOTE></DOC>
