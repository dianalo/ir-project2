ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Drought may have slowed a long-awaitedrebound in farm equipment sales, but manufacturers say they believedemand will rise in 1989, as farmers are expected to significantlystep up planting.   The size and condition of an aging fleet of farm equipment maynot be adequate to handle 25 million or more additional acres ofcrops anticipated next spring, said John Tye, president of the TyeCo. and newly elected chairman of the Farm and Industrial EquipmentInstitute.   ``This factor, combined with the fact that many farmers who willbe handling the increased production are more secure financiallythan a year ago, should stimulate demand,'' Tye said.   Tye said the government has agreed to allow farmers tosubstantially increase 1989 plantings without jeopardizing theirfederal subsidies. He said such increased activity would come at atime industry inventories are at the lowest levels in years, andthe fleet of machines in use has the highest average age in twodecades.   The comments came in assessments released at the annualconvention of the equipment manufacturers which ends today in BocaRaton, Fla., and distributed by the Chicago-based group.   Hans W. Becherer, president of Deere andamp; Co., said he believesfarmers deferred purchases this year and are awaiting signsthere'll be no repeat of this summer's drought.   He noted record levels of farm income in 1987 and 1988 and saidthat should boost sales in 1989.   ``Farmers, overall, are in a better financial situation thanthey have been for many years. The need for new equipment is there,if the weather cooperates, 1989 could be a very good year,'' saidBernard L. Nielsen, president of the Gehl Co.   The drought hit the farm equipment industry just as it wasmaking headway in a recovery from a severe slump.   After seven years of decline, spending on farm machinery rose to$5.77 billion in 1987 from $4.61 billion in 1986, according to theEconomic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.That still was below the record of nearly $12 billion in sales in1979.   The USDA is forecasting 1988 sales may range from $5.7 billionto $6.2 billion, spurred by a sales boom early in the year beforethe drought shriveled crops in the field.   ``In spite of the drought, the combination of high commodityprices and government drought payments mean the farmer will havesignificant net farm income available with which to purchase,''said John Annin, vice president of operations for Farmhand Inc.   James K. Askford, president of Case IH, predicted sales oftwo-wheel-drive tractors over 130 horsepower would rise from 15percent to 20 percent as drought-delayed purchases are made in1989. He also said his company expects sales of combines,implements, hay and forage equipment will increase.   ``We feel very positive about the agricultural outlook in1989,'' said William Templeton, vice president for marketing atDeutz-Allis Corp. ``We see very strong sales gains in largetwo-wheeled-drive farm tractors and self-propelled combines alongwith significant gains in tillage and hay tools.''   Robert F. Moglia, chairman of Ford New Holland Inc., said,``More favorable weather this fall and winter should help industrysales resume pre-drought recovery for tractors over 40 horsepowerand related equipment.''   He predicted the heaviest buying activity would occur early nextyear, with sales continuing at a more moderate rate for the rest of1989.   Richard Anderson, general manager of the agriculture productsgroup of Behlen Manufacturing Co., said he feels there is onlylimited demand for grain storage and handling equipment.   ``Lower than expected yields and greater exports of grain in1988 will definitely have a negative effect on the grain storagemarket,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
