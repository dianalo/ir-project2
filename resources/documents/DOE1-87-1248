<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-1248 </DOCNO><TEXT>NO/sub x/ emissions from different commercial gas burners for metal heattreatment applications were measured for a research project of the Gaswaerme-Institut.The burners, rated at up to 50 kW, were installed for the tests in alaboratory combustion chamber operated at temperatures of up to 1400/sup0/C. The air for combustion was preheated to a maximum temperature of600/sup 0/C. Following the tests, the potentials of different NO/subx/ control techniques were investigated. Methods explored included stagedcombustion air injection, staged fuel injection and fuel gas injectioninto the flue for NO/sub x/ reduction. The results showed that it isfeasible to reduce the NO/sub x/ content of flue gases by as much as90%.</TEXT></DOC>
