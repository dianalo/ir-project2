Boone Pickens Jr.    The Amarillo, Texas-based oil and gas master limited partnership disclosed the holdings in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which is required when an entity's marketable securities exceed $100 million. Mesa had $204.9 million in marketable securities at year's end.    Mesa said in the filing that its holdings at Dec. 31 included 1.8 million Burlington Northern shares, which then had a value of $95.9 million and represented about 2.4% of the Seattle-based railroad and energy concern's 74 million shares outstanding.    Mesa's investments at Dec. 31 also included 1.8 million Amerada Hess common shares, which then had a value of $43.3 million and represented about 2.1% of the energy concern's 84 million shares outstanding. In addition, the partnership owned call options representing 336,600 Amerada Hess common shares, then valued at $2.2 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Burlington Northern shares closed at $68.375, up $2.375, and Amerada Hess shares closed at $28.375, up 62.5 cents.    The filing indicated that Mesa shares its holdings in the two companies with another party, but it didn't elaborate. A Mesa spokesman declined to comment on the filing. Amerada Hess officials couldn't be reached for comment, and a Burlington Northern spokesman declined to comment.    Energy analysts and industry sources have speculated for several months that Mr. Pickens might be interested in acquiring New York-based Amerada Hess or the oil and gas properties of Burlington Northern.    Amerada Hess is considered a choice acquisition candidate for Mesa because it has a huge cash flow of about $700 million and its market value of about $2.13 billion is relatively small for an integrated domestic oil company.    Burlington Northern has extensive oil and gas holdings, including Meridian Petroleum Holding Inc., El Paso Natural Gas and Southland Royalty Co., a Fort Worth, Texas-based concern that Mr. Pickens tried to buy many years ago. Some analysts speculate that Mr. Pickens may prefer to encourage Burlington Northern to restructure, rather than try to take over the whole company.    As previously reported, Mesa and a partner, Harbert Corp., a Birmingham, Ala.-based real estate and construction concern, recently abandoned a bid to acquire Diamond Shamrock Corp. for about $2 billion after Diamond Shamrock launched an aggressive restructuring effort. Mesa and Harbert have since sold their five million Diamond Shamrock shares, netting about $5 million after expenses.    Mesa has conceded that it needs to increase its cash flow by at least $45 million to afford its $2-a-unit annual cash distribution. If it can't increase cash flow through acqusitions or investment gains, it has said it will dip into its cash reserves to continue the distribution.    In the filing, Mesa said it also was the sole owner at Dec. 31 of 154,500 shares of BankAmerica Corp., then valued at about $2.3 million.    The filing didn't disclose what prices Mesa paid for any of the holdings, nor did it indicate when or for what purpose the purchases were made. </TEXT></DOC>
