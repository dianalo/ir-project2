The project won't represent an acquisition of the Czechstate-owned concern's property but will establish a new,separate company, with ownership evenly split between thepartners. Plzenske Pivovary owns the mineral springs fromwhich the water will be produced but in the past has usedthem only as a source of high-quality water for making beer.</LP><TEXT>   New York-based DGL will contribute $10 million as initialseed money to complete construction of water bottlingfacilities at the brewery site. The water will be sold underthe trademark Bohemia Spa Waters and targeted at the premiumbottled-water market world-wide and particularly in the U.S.The venture will be the first to export water fromCzechoslovakia's abundant and underexploited mineral springs,which provide much of the country's drinking water becausemost municipal supplies lack adequate treatment facilities.   The three theme parks, to be called Pilsner UrquellEuroworld, will aim to capture the free time and money of thefive million annual visitors to the west Bohemian spas of theKarlovy Vary-Marianske Lazne and Frantiskove Lazne region.   &quot;These people come for average stays of two weeks. Butwhen their few hours of daily treatment are over, they havenothing to do,&quot; says Daniel Lang, chairman of DGL.   One park will center on cultural programs, such asconcerts, dance and conferences, one will be a hunting andfishing preserve, and the third a family entertainment park.   The venture will lease land for the parks from localauthorities and select a U.S. theme park group to develop thefacilities, which will include at least three hotels tosupplement the area's 6,000 beds, and sales points forPilsner Urquell beer and DGL's own food products. DGL'scustomers for distribution of institutional food productsworld-wide include the U.S. military.   Pavel Gregoric, Plzenske Pivovary's general director, saidthe venture would allow the breweries to generate income fromnon-brewing activities to finance an increase in beerproduction. The breweries, one of Czechoslovakia's mostsuccessful exporters, produce 92.5 million gallons yearly buthave orders for 2 1/2 times as much.   At the end of this month, Plzenske Pivovary will submit aprivatization project to government authorities, and hopes tobe privatized as early as December. Stanislav Svec, thecommercial director, said that they are studying dozens ofoffers from Germany, Japan and elsewhere, but that no foreigncooperation agreement had yet been reached.</TEXT></DOC>
