Singhboosted his chances of opposing Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi innational elections by taking a commanding lead today in aparliamentary election.   With 70.5 percent of the ballots counted from Thursday's specialelection in the Allahabad district, Singh had 54 percent to 24percent for his nearest challenger, singer and film writer SunilShastri.   Shastri, son of the late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, wasthe candidate of Gandhi's Congress Party. Singh ran as anindependent with the backing of several opposition parties.   By early evening today, the 56-year-old Singh had 163,058 of the300,000 votes counted. Shastri, 38, had 71,868. The rest weredivided among 66 other candidates.   Gandhi was quoted by Indian news agency reporters as saying thatthe election results were not unexpected.   ``The ruling party gets it in its neck'' in off-year elections,Gandhi was quoted as saying. ``The Congress is satisfied over theoutcome of the polls as it has come at a difficult time.''   About 850,000 people were eligible to vote, but election workersestimated only about 50 percent turned out.   The Allahabad contest was one of seven special parliamentaryelections conducted Thursday. By this morning, the Congress Partyhad captured one seat and opposition parties had two.   Votes were still being counted in three other constituencies,including Allahabad. In the seventh district, in Haryana state, thecount has not begun because of reports of ballot-stuffing.   In state legislative elections also conducted Thursday, theCongress Party took five seats and opposition parties won five.Vote-counting was stayed in an 11th contest in Haryana statebecause of the ballot-stuffing charges.   The contest in Allahabad, 360 miles southeast of New Delhi,provided the first voter test of Singh's ability to oppose PrimeMinister Gandhi for the leadership of the nation.   Under its constitution, India must conduct national elections nolater than January 1990.   Singh, who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, was amember of Gandhi's Congress Party until last summer when he brokewith the prime minister and quit the Cabinet over the government'shesitation to investigate corruption.   As defense minister, Singh wanted to look into allegations thatkickbacks were paid to purchase Bofors artillery guns from Swedenand submarines from West Germany.   According to Indian press reports, the kickbacks were paid togovernment officials and friends of Gandhi. Gandhi himself wasnever accused of wrongdoing, and a parliamentary report later saidit had uncovered no irregularities.</TEXT></DOC>
