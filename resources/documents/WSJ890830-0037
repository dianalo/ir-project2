Judge Barrington Parker gave the agency until Oct. 30 to issue a rule that establishes uniform terms for defining specific ranges of absorbency and requires manufacturers to display them on their products.    He faulted the FDA for &quot;unreasonable&quot; delays. Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Washington-based watchdog organization, petitioned the agency for such a rule in 1982 after several women died from toxic-shock syndrome, a disease linked to high-absorbency tampons.    &quot;Without this regulation, women cannot compare . . . the absorbency of a particular brand to another,&quot; the judge said, &quot;and women will continue to subject themselves needlessly to the risk of serious injury and even death from toxic-shock syndrome.&quot;    Currently, some manufacturers use vague terms such as &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;super&quot; and &quot;super plus&quot; to describe the varying absorbency of their products, while other manufacturers display a numerical absorbency rating of their various tampons. But Public Citizen argued that a uniform labeling standard must be set for the industry. </TEXT></DOC>
