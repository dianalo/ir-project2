Thiswas followed by second look laparotomy in 66 patients with no clinicalevidence of disease. Consolidation abdominal irradiation was administeredto 43 patients. Two techniques of irradiation were employed: between1980-1983 whole abdominal irradiation was used and patients were to receive3000 cGy in 4 weeks (Schedule I). Due to myelosuppression only 13 of26 patients (50%) completed the planned dose of radiation. Between 1983-1985the target volume was divided into upper and lower parts. First, thelower abdomen received 3000 cGy in 3 weeks, and then the upper abdomenreceived the same dose (Schedule II). Sixteen of seventeen patients (94%)thus treated, completed the planned dose of radiation. The actuarialsurvival for all 116 patients was 28% of 5 years. Irradiated patientswith negative second look laparotomy had a survival probability of 100%at 24 months. Irradiated patients with microscopic disease at secondlook operation had an actuarial 5-year survival of 66%. Patients withminimal residual disease at second look laparotomy, receiving consolidationabdominal irradiation, had an actuarial survival of 5% only at 36 months.It is concluded that consolidation radiotherapy is effective in patientswith negative or microscopic residual disease at second-look laparotomy.In regard to bone marrow tolerance, split field technique of irradiationis preferred.</TEXT></DOC>
