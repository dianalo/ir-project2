Background </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4> of August 10, 1979 (44 FR 47162), FDA announcedthe current action levels for lead that leaches from ceramic foodware.These action levels were based on the recommendations of the World HealthOrganization (WHO). FDA established different leachable lead action levelsfor ceramic foodware based on the capacity and probable use of the foodware.There are action levels for three different types of ceramic foodware incurrent Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7117.07 (Ref. 1): (1) Flatware: an article with an internal depth of not more than 25 millimeters_anaverage of not more than 7.0 micrograms of lead per milliliter of leachingsolution from six units examined; (2) Small Hollowware: an article with a capacity of less than 1.1 liters_5.0micrograms of lead per milliliter of leaching solution in any one unit;and (3) Large Hollowware: an article with a capacity of 1.1 liters or more_2.5micrograms of lead per milliliter of leaching solution in any one unit.At the time the action levels were established, FDA was using recommendedtolerable total lead intakes from all sources of not more than 100 microgramsper day (andCx.18;g/day) for infants from birth to 6 months of age and notmore than 150 andCx.18;g/day for children from 6 months to 2 years of age(44 FR 51233 at 51234; August 31, 1979). Recent toxicology and epidemiology studies on lead have shown adverse effectsin children, including deficits in intelligence and reduced stature atlead exposure levels that were once thought not to be associated with adverseeffects. Therefore, several national and international organizations havelowered their tolerable levels for lead exposure for children. FDA alsobelieves that a lower tolerable level is appropriate. Given these reductionsin the tolerable levels, the agency believes that it is necessary to reducethe exposure to lead as a contaminant of foods in situations in which currentlevels of exposure are high and it is practicable to reduce those levels.ln this document FDA is proposing to establish an enforcement limit forceramic pitchers, except creamers, that is 25 to 50 times lower than thecurrent action levels for these items. The agency has chosen to do so becausethese items are likely to store acidic beverages that are consumed by childrenin substantial amounts. The agency also believes that this proposed actionwill have a minimal impact on the affected industry. Because the agency believes that reductions in lead for other types ofceramicware may also be appropriate, this notice is soliciting informationon lead contamination limits for all other ceramic foodware. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Lead Toxicity </ITAG>The primary targets for lead toxicity are the nervous system (both centraland peripheral), the red blood cells and their stem cells, and the renalsystem. Recent information suggests significant lead toxicity at lead levelslower than those that had previously been associated with lead toxicity.For example, deficits in intelligence and behavioral dysfunction have beenreported in children who have blood lead levels as low as 10 microgramsper deciliter (andCx.18;g/dL) and who are otherwise asymptomatic. Severaleffects on heme synthesis (production of the iron-containing componentof hemoglobin) have also been found at low levels. For example, the enzymethat converts protoporphyrin to heme, ferrochelatase, has been reportedto be inhibited in children at blood lead levels as low as 15 andCx.18;g/dL.In addition, inhibition of another heme synthetic enzyme, gamma-aminolevulinicacid dehydrase, can occur in children and adults at blood lead levels aslow as 10 andCx.18;g/dL. Other studies have noted that blood lead levelsas low as 10 to 15 andCx.18;g/dL are associated with reduced stature andweight gain and diminished chest circumference in children, and that bloodlead levels as low as 25 andCx.18;g/dL are associated with a reduction incirculation levels of the active form of vitamin D (Refs. 2 and 3). Although some of the same adverse effects are found in adults at low bloodlead levels, children are a particularly vulnerable population becausethese adverse effects will occur in them at lower blood lead levels thanin adults. In addition, children are estimated to have blood lead levelsfour times higher than adults from ingesting equal amounts of lead. Inchildren, for every andCx.18;g/day increase in dietary lead, blood lead hasbeen estimated to increase 0.16 to 0.2 andCx.18;g/dL (Ref. 2). Thus, becauseof the potential seriousness of the adverse effects, the relatively lowblood lead level at which such effects occur, and the particular sensitivityof children to low ingestion levels, FDA is reviewing lead exposure fromfoods, with priority given to the exposure of children. This proposal isthe result of the agency's reevaluation of the toxicity of, and the exposureto, lead from food served or stored in ceramic pitchers.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Revised Lead Exposure Standards </ITAG>Four governmental and international health organizations have adopted revisedguidelines or standards for total lead exposure in the last 4 years (Ref.2). In 1985, the Office of Drinking Water of the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) put forth a health advisory for lead exposure based on a bloodlead level of 15 to 20 andCx.18;g/dL in infants. In 1988 (53 FR 31516; August18, 1988), EPA, based in part on its conclusion that blood lead levelsof 10 to 15 andCx.18;g/dL are of concern for health effects, proposed a revisedmaximum contaminant level for lead of 5 andCx.18;g/L for drinking water enteringthe distribution system. In January 1985, the Centers for Disease Controlpublished a revised guideline specifying that an excessive absorption oflead is that amount resulting in a blood lead level of 25 andCx.18;g/dL ormore (Ref. 2). In June 1986, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additivesof the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO)established a provisional tolerable weekly intake for lead of 25 microgramsper kilogram (andCx.18;g/kg) of body weight for infants and children (Ref.4). Finally, in 1986, WHO established a blood lead level of 20 andCx.18;g/dLas the ``exposure level of action'' (Ref. 2). FDA has converted these guidelines and standards into a common format ofandCx.18;g/day lead intake that is useful in considering lead intake fromfoods for children. In performing this conversion, FDA attributed 50 percentof the total lead intake for children to food, as the available data suggest(Ref. 2). In converting the guidelines/standards expressed as andCx.18;glead/dL blood to andCx.18;g/day lead intake, a factor of 0.16 andCx.18;g/dLper andCx.18;g dietary lead/day was used as well as an uncertainty factorof 5. The use of an uncertainty factor is consistent with the approachused by EPA in 1985 to arrive at exposure numbers. The range of tolerablelevels derived in this way is 6 to 18 andCx.18;g/day for lead intake fromfood for a 10-kilogram (kg) (22-pound) child (Ref. 2). Having reviewedthe adverse health effects information, along with recently adopted leadguidelines and standards of other health organizations, the agency hasdecided to use the 6 to 18 andCx.18;g/day range as a provisional tolerablerange for lead intake from food for a 10-kg child. The agency is using a range and considers it ``provisional'' because thereis presently a lack of consensus within the scientific community on thethreshold for lead toxicity in children. The agency believes that thisrange provides an appropriate guide for concern about the health effects,even though, at this time, it is not possible to establish a thresholdlevel for lead toxicity. Data (unpublished) from the FDA Total Diet Studies for the period Julyl986 to May l987 show that the average dietary intake of lead is 4.7 andCx.18;g/dayfor children 6 through 11 months old (9 kg) and 6.4 andCx.18;g/day for children2 years old (13 kg) (Ref. 5). Thus, the Total Diet Studies indicate thataverage dietary lead intake for children is at the low end of the provisionaltolerable range and provide a strong basis for concern about any significantadditional dietary intake of lead. Based on this information, the agencyfinds that it is important to establish regulatory limits for levels atwhich lead contamination may render food injurious to health whenever itis possible to do so. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Ceramic Pitchers </ITAG>Ceramic pitchers used as food storage vessels are one potential food sourceof significant lead contamination that may result in excessive dietarylead intake.\1\<NOTE/> The present action levels for leachable lead from large andsmall ceramic hollowware, including pitchers, are 2.5 andCx.18;g/mL and 5.0andCx.18;g/mL of leaching solution, respectively. Thus, for example, if avessel were to leach lead into a food at the 2.5 andCx.18;g/mL level, thefood stored in that vessel would be contaminated with 2.5 andCx.18;g of leadfor each mL of fluid. Consumption of as little as 10 mL (approximatelytwo teaspoonfuls) per day of food with this lead level would result iningestion of 25 andCx.18;g of lead per day, which is greater than the provisionaltolerable range (6 to 18 andCx.18;g/day) for children.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The agency is excluding ceramic creamers from the proposedregulatory limit because they are not normally used as storage vesselsfor acidic foods that are consumed by children. Ceramic pitchers, excluding creamers, may be used to store acidic foods,such as orange juice, that are consumed by children. Consequently, theagency has evaluated the consumption of juices by children using MarketResearch Corp. of America 14-day frequency of eating data (Menu CensusVI, 1977 to 1978) and the U.S Department of Agriculture data on portionsize (1977 to 1978). Of the various juices, frozen juices are consumedin the largest quantities. These surveys give mean and 90th percentiledaily consumption of frozen juices (eaters only) as 72 grams (g) and 154g, respectively, for children 6 through 23 months old, and 91 g and 165g, respectively, for children 2  through 5 years old. Children consumingmean quantities of these juices stored in ceramic pitchers from which leadleached at the current action level could consume 180 to 455 andCx.18;g perday of lead. This lead intake would be more than 10 times greater thanthe provisional tolerable range of 6 to 18 andCx.18;g/day (Ref. 6). Consequently,the agency tentatively concludes that the current action level is not adequateto protect the public from excessive intake of lead from food stored inceramic pitchers, excluding creamers. If the level at which lead leaches into juice from these ceramic pitcherswere limited to 0.1 andCx.18;g lead/mL of juice, however, the daily leadintake for children consuming juice at the mean consumption rate wouldbe 7 andCx.18;g/day for children 6 through 23 months old and 9 andCx.18;g/dayfor children 2 through 5 years old. At 90th percentile juice consumptionrates, the lead intake would be 15 andCx.18;g/day for children 6 through23 months old and 16 andCx.18;g/day for children 2 through 5 years old (Ref.6). The agency considers that these exposure levels, which are upper boundintake estimates, are within the provisional tolerable range for lead intakefor food for a 10-kg child. Lead levels that exceed this level exceed theprovisional tolerable range and may render the food injurious to health.Therefore, FDA is proposing to establish a binding regulatory limit of0.1 andCx.18;g lead/mL of test solution under sections 402(a)(1) and 701(a)of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)and 371(a)). If FDA decides to adopt this proposal, ceramic food-servicepitchers, excluding creamers, that leach lead at levels that exceed 0.1andCx.18;g/mL will be adulterated as a matter of law.The agency is proposing to use analytical method AOAC/ASTM, 14th Ed., sections25.024-25.027, (1984) to implement the proposed regulatory limit. Thismethod is the regulatory method used in the action levels for ceramicware(CPG 7117.07). This analytical method has a quantitation limit of 0.1 andCx.18;g/mLof leaching solution if the method's concentration step is used (Ref. 7).The agency will continue to use this analytical method (cited in CPG 7117.07as AOAC 12th Ed., 25.031-25.034) in enforcement actions related to thecurrent action level guidance for leachable lead from the other ceramicwarespecified in CPG 7117.07 (Ref. 1). FDA believes that a regulatory limit of 0.1 andCx.18;g lead/mL of test solutionis an appropriate limit, even though the upper bound intake is close tothe upper limit of the provisional tolerable range. To ensure that allpieces produced will be in compliance with the proposed limit, FDA expectsthat manufacturers will produce pieces that, on average, leach lead atlevels significantly below the limit. Further assurance of the adequacy of this limit derives from the fact thatthe leaching test exaggerates leaching by acidic foods, and that the actuallead intake from juice stored in ceramic pitchers will be less than thatpredicted based on leaching test results. The leaching test is conductedat room temperature (22 anddegrees;C) using 4 percent acetic acid, whereasproducts stored in ceramic pitchers, particularly acidic juices, are likelyto be less acidic than 4 percent acetic acid and refrigerated at temperaturesof around 5 anddegrees;C. Because the amount of lead that is leached froma ceramic storage vessel decreases with decreasing acidity of the foodand decreasing storage temperature, the agency expects any amount of leadleached from ceramic pitchers that comply with the proposed regulatorylimit into stored food products will be less than the amount leached duringtesting. Therefore, the agency believes that actual lead intakes of childrenfrom lead leached from ceramic pitchers that are in compliance with the0.1 andCx.18;g/mL regulatory limit generally will be below the upper boundintake estimates of 15 and 16 andCx.18;g lead/mL (Ref. 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Ceramic Foodware </ITAG>As described above, the agency has established leachable lead action levelsfor ceramic large hollowware, small hollowware and flatware. It has notestablished a leachable lead level for ceramic cookware. The agency isevaluating the leachable lead levels and the exposure resulting from common,everyday use of these articles. This review is being made in light of themost current lead toxicity information and the provisional tolerable rangeof 6 to 18 andCx.18;g/day for lead intake from food for a 10-kg child. The current leachable lead action levels for ceramic flatware, small hollowware,and large hollowware were established at three different levels based onthe expected level of hazard attributed to the type of ware. Because ofthe growing evidence of potential health hazards at much lower lead levelsthan those considered in the late 1970's when the current leachable leadlevels were established, however, the agency believes that the currentaction levels for leachable lead from ceramicware (other than the pitchersaddressed by this proposal) for food use may need to be reduced substantially,and that a comparable low action level may need to be established for leachablelead from ceramic cookware. Presently, FDA has only limited data concerning the concentration of leachablelead in food, particularly hot food, stored or served in these other typesof ceramic foodware. The agency is therefore requesting submission of informationand data concerning the relationship between the levels of lead extractedin tests of ceramicware using the AOAC method cited above and actual food-usecontamination. This correlation data should be submitted for considerationwith respect to this proposal and to the review of possible hazardous leadlevels from all types of ceramic foodware, including cookware. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Decorative Ceramicware </ITAG>Current CPG 7117.07, dated October 2, 1980 (Ref. 1), provides that ceramicwaremay be considered unsuitable for food use if:<ITAG tagnum="25">(1) [it is] made or rendered unsuitable for such purpose by some artificesuch as holes bored through the potential food contact surface</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20"/><T3>   or</T3>,<ITAG tagnum="25">(2) [it bears] a label, incapable of obliteration, permanently affixedto the article's potential food contact surface; and if such label statesthat the article  is `not for food use' along with a statement of the hazardassociated with the article if used for food purposes.</ITAG>During the past few years, the agency has encountered decorative ceramicwarearticles that appeared to be suitable for food use and that leached excessivelevels of heavy metals, particularly lead and cadmium. In addition to regulatoryand administrative actions to remove the violative ceramicware from commercialchannels, FDA reviewed the criteria for determining whether ceramicwareis suitable for food use. As a result of this review, the agency has determinedthat the criteria as stated in CPG 7117.07 are too general and vague and,therefore, are subject to misinterpretation.The agency is particularly concerned about those decorative and ornamentalarticles of ceramicware with lead glazes or decorations on potential food-contactsurfaces that, because of their shape or design, may mistakenly be usedto hold food. It also is concerned that statements that identify a productas not for food use, if not permanently affixed, will fall off. The agencyreiterated these concerns in a letter issued June 24, 1988, to all knownceramicware decorators, decal producers, and trade associations. This letteremphasized that decorative and ornamental ceramicware should bear conspicuousand legible permanent labeling fired into the item stating ``Not for FoodUse_May Poison Food'' or, as an alternative, be rendered unsuitable forholding liquid foods by some means, such as drilled holes (Ref. 8). Because of repeated incidents involving decorative ceramicware that wasmistakenly used to store food and that was found to have no permanentlyaffixed statement advising against such use, the agency has tentativelyconcluded that the policy established in CPG 7117.07 concerning decorativeceramicware is not sufficient to assure that decorative articles will bedistinguishable from food-service articles. Therefore, the agency is proposing to adopt a regulation that states thatall decorative or ornamental ceramicware that appears to be suitable forfood use (i.e., is capable of holding food and may be assumed by a consumerto be for food use) will be deemed to be intended for food use, and thussubject to the standards of adulteration for food-contact articles, unlessthe fact that they are not intended for food use is established in at leastone of the following ways: (1) They bear on the external surface of the base of the article the statement``Not for Food Use_May Poison Food.'' The statement must be permanent,conspicuous, legible, and in a type size of not less than one eighth inchin height. The statement may be molded into the base as a part of the ceramicwareor may be a decal type label fired into the surface, or; (2) A hole is bored through the potential food-contact surface of the decorativeceramicware to make it unsuitable for food use. While the agency believes that an effective method must be adopted to clearlymake decorative ceramicware that appears to be suitable for food use andthat leaches excessive amounts of lead unsuitable for food use, the agencywill consider alternative effective approaches. Therefore, FDA is interestedin obtaining information concerning the most effective method, if not thoseproposed, of clearly and permanently distinguishing between ceramic foodwareand decorative ceramicware. In evaluating the effectiveness of any approach,the agency intends to put substantial weight on the permanence of the noticethat the ceramicware is not suitable for food use. This factor is particularlyimportant because decorative ceramicware frequently is passed from generationto generation. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Request for Comments and Information </ITAG>By means of this proposal, the agency is requesting comment on the followingspecific matters as well as any other matters that may be of particularconcern to the industry or consumers: (1) Lead toxicity and the provisional tolerable intake range; (2) Lead exposure from use of the various kinds of ceramicware for foodservice; (3) Leachability of lead from ceramicware under the normal range of actualconditions of use as compared to the leachable lead recovered by the currentregulatory test method; (4) Lowest leachable lead levels routinely attainable for ceramicware,particularly fine china, that employs leadcontatning materials in the food-contactsurface; (5) The impact, including costs, of achieving these low levels; (6) The impact, including costs, number of articles affected, and environmentaleffects, of the proposed regulatory limit for ceramic pitchers, excludingcreamers; (7) Availability of alternative glazes and decorations that do not containlead, their composition, and leachability of potentially toxic substancesinto food or approprlate test solutions from these glazes and decorations;and (8) The impact of the proposed requirements for decorative ceramicwarethat resembles foodware and contains leachable lead. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Economic Impact </ITAG>In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, theagency has considered the effect that this proposed rule would have onsmall entities including large and small businesses and has determinedthat the proposed action will not result in a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Furthermore, in accordance with Executive Order12291, the agency has analyzed the economic effects of this regulationand has determined that the rule, if promulgated, will not be a major ruleas defined by that Order. The economic threshold assessment may be seenin the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Environmental Imapct </ITAG>The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. Based on the available information, FDA has concluded thatthe action will not have a significant impact on the human environment,and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency'sfinding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding,contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Managementbranch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.The agency will reevaluate its environmental decision if new informationis received suggesting that the action would have significant environmentaleffects. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Effective Date </ITAG>The agency is proposing that all new ceramic food-service pitchers, excludingcreamers, and all new decorative or ornamental ceramicware initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce 6 monthsafter publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of any final rulemaking in this action shallcomply with the regulation. The agency is also specifically requestingcomment on the appropriateness of the proposed effective date for thisaction. All comments concerning the effective date should be accompaniedby data to support or justify any change in the proposed effective date.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI.
