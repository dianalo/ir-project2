The results show that the dielectric properties weregreatly affected by the radiation at low frequencies, and less affectedat the higher frequencies. Also the radiation reduced the peak valuesof the dielectric properties at low frequencies, at 123{sup 0}C, butlittle effect was detected at the higher frequencies and the other temperatures.(U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
