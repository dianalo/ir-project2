Most ofthese agents are used only for diagnostic purposes, implying that theamount of drug that must be administered to provide useful informationwill produce no effects from chemical toxicity, and that the resultantdose will be much smaller than the levels producing demonstrable somaticradiation damage. For therapeutic applications, on the other hand, thequantities of radioactivity required for the desired result may producesecondary radiation effects from which the body will recover. &quot;Radiopharmaceuticals&quot;differ from &quot;radiochemicals&quot; in that they are medicinals subject to biologiccontrol testing to avoid any type of adverse reaction following administrationto patients. The agents of value for external imaging discussed in thischapter constitute only a small segment of a large group of radioactivetracers employed in medical diagnosis and biologic research. As willbe seen, the physical and biologic properties of this special group ofagents are significantly different from those of nonradioactive drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
