Delegates to a special council chanted ``Death to the Russians!''and ``God is great!'' as their leaders declared that the Kremlin hadsuffered a devastating and humiliating defeat.   The last Red Army soldiers left Afghanistan on Wednesday afternine years of involvement in the civil war that cost the Sovietsabout 15,000 dead and 35,000 wounded.   ``It was the power of the faith, the steadfastness anddetermination of the Afghan Moslem nation that forced the Russiansto leave our nation,'' guerrilla leader Rasul Sayyaf told a newsconference.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in 1978and, before the withdrawal began last May under a U.N.-mediatedagreement, faced an estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers as well as theAfghan army.   Sayyaf said a plan for an interim government was presented to thecouncil, or shura, of about 400 delegates and would be debated forseveral days before a vote was taken.   It calls for approval of a provisional government the guerrillascreated last summer with Ahmed Shah as prime minister, but somecabinet appointments announced previously are expected to be changed.   Leaders of the seven parties in the insurgent alliance based inPakistan have been deeply divided for years, competing for power andinfluence. Ahmed Shah leads one of the parties.   Wednesday's session was the first full one since the shuraassembled Friday. It became deadlocked almost immediately and partyleaders wrangled over key issues in private.   The council is seen as the best chance for the guerrillas to forma united government that could take control and restore peace andstability to Afghanistan after 11 years of war.   Even with an interim government, top party leaders are expectedto retain ultimate control. Sayyaf said the seven leaders wouldserve as an executive body for the temporary administration.   Afghanistan's Marxist government said Wednesday the council'sdecisions were meaningless. ``The decision of the so-called shura isnot important to the Afghan nation,'' said Kabul radio, monitored inIslamabad.   Guerrilla officials, speaking privately, said some councildelegates expressed opposition Wednesday to Ahmed Shah or said anindividual should be head of state rather than the collectiveleadership.   One of the seven parties, the Afghan National Liberation Front,boycotted the council. Officials of the party said they would notreturn until Shiite Moslem guerrillas based in Iran were included inthe council or shura.   Front leader Sibghatullah Mojaddidi had offered the Shiites 100seats in the council and seven cabinet posts. Leaders of the othersix parties rejected the plan.   Most of the guerrillas based in Pakistan are Sunni Moslems, asare 80 percent of Afghanistan's people. Shiites make up about 15percent of the population.   Sayyaf said the council had appointed a committee to deal withthe Shiite issue. He also said all parties would attend the councilThursday, but aides to Mojaddidi said their party would stay outuntil the question was resolved.   Shiite representatives have said they will accept nothing lessthan Mojaddidi's proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
