Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN </IN><TEXT>   Few people would disagree that Americans have gone lawsuit-crazy. Even former U.S. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger has called the phenomenon a &quot;litigation explosion during this generation.&quot;    Common to such laments is the contention that a marked increase in product-liability suits has led to what the National Association of Manufacturers recently called &quot;a blood bath for U.S. businesses.&quot;    But Marc Galanter, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin, is challenging the conventional wisdom. In the latest of a series of studies on U.S. litigation, he maintains that increased filings in federal courts have been sparked more by businesses suing one another over contract disputes than by citizens attacking corporate defendants.    Mr. Galanter says that his preliminary results &quot;cast a lot of doubt on the widely held assumption that it's primarily the ordinary guy suing the big company that has caused a litigation explosion.&quot;    Some colleagues say Mr. Galanter's study could affect the continuing debate over so-called tort-reform statutes, which do such things as set caps on jury awards for injuries. Lately, plaintiffs' lawyers have stepped up court challenges to such statutes, arguing that the restrictions aren't based on accurate information about the state of the civil justice system.    Jerry J. Phillips, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, asserts that Mr. Galanter's research &quot;raises questions that legislators ought to consider about whether the insurers and manufacturers have been so honest&quot; in portraying a litigation landscape dominated by tort suits.    The statistics seem to support Mr. Galanter's arguments. He found that between 1960 and 1986 the number of contract disputes filed annually in federal trial courts increased 258%, to 47,443 cases from 13,268. That rise far outstripped the growth in tort cases, in which plaintiffs seek civil remedies for physical injuries and other kinds of harm. In the same period, tort filings increased 114%, to 41,979 cases from 19,584.    Yet the rise in corporate contract disputes &quot;has not only escaped condemnation, but has rarely if ever been mentioned as the scene of burgeoning caseloads,&quot; Mr. Galanter argues in the study, which was published last month by the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Legal Studies.    In an interview, the 57-year-old professor attributes the lack of attention paid to contract filings to the success of corporations and their lawyers in shaping popular perceptions of what goes on in the courts. He also blames the press for sensationalizing arguably trivial cases in which individuals win unusually large injury awards.    Mr. Galanter, who based his work on statistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, admits that he, too, had been &quot;blind&quot; to the contract filings because &quot;we are conditioned not to think of businesses contributing to the so-called litigation explosion.&quot; He says he noticed the trend only when his son arranged the data on a computer spreadsheet. &quot;Suddenly, it jumped out,&quot; he recalls.    He concedes that the study is limited because it focuses exclusively on the federal courts, where only a small fraction of all litigation in the country takes place. But reliable comparative data on the state courts are relatively rare, he explains. In any case, most of the warnings about runaway litigiousness also rely on federal-court figures.    Those figures show that total civil filings rose 398% between 1960 and 1986, to 254,000 from 51,000. By 1986, contract cases made up 18.7% of the total, surpassing tort cases (at 16.5%) as the largest category.    Critics of Mr. Galanter's research say his statistics distract attention from simple realities. James W. Morris III, president of the Defense Research Institute, an association of corporate and insurance defense lawyers, contends that the rash of huge product-liability jury awards, not aggregate numbers of cases, is what concerns his clients most.    Moreover, he says that Mr. Galanter's research doesn't account for thousands of settlements reluctantly agreed to each year by corporate defendants afraid of risking an unpredictable jury trial. &quot;What he doesn't explain is that expectations have been greatly raised and that, these days, potentially any case can blow up on you,&quot; says Mr. Morris.    Mr. Galanter agrees that a huge share of civil filings -- more than 90%, by most estimates -- end in settlement rather than in courtroom confrontation. But he interprets the situation as illustrating that lawsuits are frequently part of a more complicated negotiation process, and that the legal system isn't collapsing amid all-out combat.    Mr. Galanter also says that Mr. Morris's comments about product-liability suits ignore important distinctions. He argues that while the overall number of such suits in federal courts has skyrocketed, along with the upper limit of jury awards in some regions, certain products have distorted the situation.    In 1986, for example, suits over asbestos accounted for 43% of all federal product-liability cases. That discrete &quot;subpopulation&quot; of cases has grown as the insulation material's disease-causing properties became known, says Mr. Galanter, but will eventually dwindle because asbestos products aren't made anymore.    As for the causes of the surge in contract fights, those remain unclear. Mr. Galanter speculates that relevant factors include increased franchising, the rise in mergers and acquisitions, and the trend toward internationalization of the economy. However, he adds, &quot;more study needs to be done.&quot;    Mr. Galanter's interpretation of his findings builds on his earlier research, which has stirred considerable controversy. Mr. Galanter is well known in legal circles for espousing unorthodox views and backing them with empirical research. He frequently criticizes traditional legal scholarship as being dominated by theoretical parsing of rules and appellate-court opinions.    Mr. Galanter has written that, according to available data, Americans aren't markedly more litigious today than in Colonial times and in the early 1800s. He has also argued that, while the Japanese seem more restrained about suing one another, Americans go to court at a rate roughly comparable to people in England, Australia, Denmark and New Zealand.    Says David B. Rottman, director of statistics for the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., &quot;No academic is as widely read by people in the courts, even if he hasn't persuaded a lot of people.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
