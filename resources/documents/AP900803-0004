The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflectedthe brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home sincecoming to power in 1979.   The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the presidentconsidered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall inthe price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.   ``Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is betterthan cutting means of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that wehave warned them,'' he said last month after prices tumbled below$14 per barrel.   He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq$14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assignedby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oilfrom a disputed field that straddled their border, and demandedthat Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraqduring the Persian Gulf war.   Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demandingrepayment for the wartime loans. Saddam said he fought the war toprotect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented bythe late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly ShiiteMoslem Iran.   Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iranafter a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arabwaterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf.   Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, thelong conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eightyears. It has still not formally ended.   The war bills kept the government from delivering materialbenefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to bracefor another year of austerity. Private investment has failed totake hold.   Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt. Its maingulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructuredamaged. Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish inIranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed orwounded.   Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's100 billion barrels.   By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financialhangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstandingwish for more gulf coastline.   Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weekswere believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulateto Iraq's demands.   But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas andSaddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he wouldnot invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over.   Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in MiddleEast politics since postwar independence from colonial powers.   Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian andSaudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state hasever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member.   Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal oppositionliberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate.   The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britainlanded troops in Kuwait.   The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf. It provedthe decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia,Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait wastoothless. The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implementits mutual defense treaty.   While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use theprecedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policyissues. Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of whathappened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands.   Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fallof one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable.   In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam hassought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq.   In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq'schemical weapons _ banned under international law _ if Iraq wasattacked. It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with thelack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in theArab-Israeli conflict.   Then Britain arrested several people on charges they weresmuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad. Weeks later, police inEurope impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable offiring chemical or nuclear shells into Israel.   Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck thescientific progress of the Arabs.   Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late EgyptianPresident Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world.   His relentless personality cult has dubbed him ``The Knight ofthe Arabs.'' For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight.   Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador toWashington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference:``Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There is not anyreason for it.''</TEXT></DOC>
