The statement, issued late last night, indicates that theSt. Louis aerospace company may be close to finding equitypartners for its jetliner operations. The company, whichneeds cash to help it launch its new MD-12 wide-body aircraftline, has been openly searching for investors andrisk-sharing subcontractors, mainly in Asia, since lastspring. If a foreign buyer is announced, it will certainlyraise questions about the U.S. sharing too much technologywith overseas concerns.</LP><TEXT>   The company's statement came in response to a report byGoldman Sachs andamp; Co., which yesterday recommended the purchaseof McDonnell Douglas stock. In response, the company's sharessoared in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,closing at $77, up $4.625.   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman declined to identify thethird parties involved in the discussions. But analysts andindustry observers have focused on manufacturers in a numberof countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan andSingapore.   An investment by one of those nations into McDonnellDouglas, which currently produces the MD-80 and MD-11airliners, could conceivably ally the company with a low-costsupplier and give it a foothold in the lucrative Pacific Rimmarket.   It also would produce the first major foreign equity stakeallowed by an American commercial-aircraft industry that longhas led the world. World-wide, the jetliner business isdominated by only three companies, Seattle-based Boeing Co.,the European Airbus Industrie consortium and McDonnellDouglas, which builds its airliners at the Long Beach,Calif., operations of its Douglas Aircraft unit.   Judith Bollinger, Goldman Sachs's aerospace analyst, saidthat a $2 billion cash infusion would increase McDonnellDouglas's earnings $1 a share and reduce debt to $700 million(17% of capital) from $2.7 billion (45% of capital). Sheseparately raised her 1992 earnings estimate for the companyto $9 a share from $8 because of &quot;more optimism on MD-80profitability.&quot;   McDonnell Douglas, while confirming the possibleinvestment level cited by Ms. Bollinger, emphasized that &quot;nounderstanding has yet been reached&quot; with any equity partner.It added that even if a deal is struck &quot;there is no assurancethat any transaction will be completed in accordance with&quot;the terms outlined.   The company, which is also the nation's biggest militarycontractor, is on pace this year to derive about 40% of its$19.5 billion in corporate revenue from the sale ofcommercial airliners. By 1993, backlog figures indicate,jetliner sales should account for more than 50% of totalrevenue.   Sale of a significant portion of McDonnell Douglas'scommercial business would be sure to spark politicalopposition from those who fear giving away the U.S.'stechnological edge in aerospace.   There are also questions about whether Exon-Florioprovisions, which prevent foreign acquisitions on nationalsecurity grounds, could come into play.   Last week, McDonnell Douglas announced that it would splitits transport aircraft unit, based in Long Beach, Calif.,into two segments -- commercial and military. Analystsinterpreted the move as an effort to pave the way for a saleof a chunk of the commercial division. But the company saidlast night that &quot;regardless of any equity investment,&quot; itwould divide the transport unit &quot;to better meet the uniquerequirements&quot; of its different customers.   Separately, the House Government Operations Committee isexpected to hold a hearing tomorrow that will look intoallegations of accounting and manufacturing problems onMcDonnell Douglas's C-17 military cargo-plane project.</TEXT></DOC>
