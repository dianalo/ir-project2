The presidential press secretary, Teodoro Benigno, said the resignation offers from the 25-member cabinet and three members of the anti-corruption Presidential Commission on Good Government were &quot;spontaneous.&quot;    This is the second mass upheaval in Mrs. Aquino's cabinet since she took office 18 months ago. However, unlike last November, when she dismissed her cabinet, Mrs. Aquino apparently didn't seek the resignation offers this time. But now, as then, the move follows an aborted coup attempt. In November, she reappointed all but three of her ministers, pointedly leaving out then-Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile, who had led a rear-guard action against her.    How Mrs. Aquino reacts to the resignation offers is a matter of intense speculation here. She is under pressure to show stronger leadership, and the move by the cabinet at least provides an opportunity to do so. Attention is focused especially on Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo, who is considered Mrs. Aquino's closest adviser and the second most-powerful member of the government.    Many analysts and even some government officials believe Mr. Arroyo will be replaced and the more-conservative faction in the cabinet will gain strength. But few believe Mrs. Aquino will opt for a major overhaul of her cabinet.    A reshuffle would &quot;give her a chance to better align policy,&quot; said Amando Doronila, editorial board chairman of the Manila Chronicle, a daily newspaper. Whether she uses that opportunity remains to be seen. It isn't even known who will help Mrs. Aquino decide. In other such crises, she first turned to Mr. Arroyo, a friend of her late husband, Benigno Aquino.    In Washington, the White House yesterday expressed support for Mrs. Aquino in any restructuring of her government.    The mass resignation offers came amid growing and more-open division within the faction-ridden cabinet. In the latest indication of how serious that split is, Mr. Arroyo openly criticized Vice President Salvador Laurel and Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin in a speech before the House of Representatives Tuesday. Although Mr. Laurel submitted his resignation as foreign affairs secretary, he would remain vice president.    &quot;The conflict is getting bigger and deeper,&quot; said a businessman with links to both groups. &quot;Something has to be done.&quot;    Although some cabinet ministers had been expected to step down, the mass action took many by surprise. Mr. Benigno said talk of resigning started during a cabinet meeting. Asked what caused the resignation offers, Mr. Benigno said: &quot;You'd have to include the entire panorama of events since the Aug. 28 coup.&quot;    First word of the resignation offers came from Trade Secretary Jose Concepcion, the Associated Press reported. His twin brother, Raul, was among three prominent business leaders whom Mr. Arroyo accused Tuesday of mounting a campaign to oust him because of their inability to gain unspecified economic favors from the president's office.    Mr. Arroyo, a former human-rights lawyer, is a highly controversial figure who has alienated not only fellow cabinet members but also the government's once-supportive business community and large sections of the military. He is widely seen as obstructive. He is accused by his opponents of blocking measures he doesn't agree with personally, of supporting or being soft on communist insurgents and of attempting to shield the president.    Pressure on Mr. Arroyo and on Special Presidential Counsel Teodoro Locsin to resign increased sharply after last month's unsuccessful coup attempt, during which Messrs. Arroyo and Locsin publicly criticized military operations. Both were widely accused of meddling in efforts by pro-government forces to beat back the rebel soldiers.    During meetings held in various military camps this week and last, Mr. Laurel found rank-and-file soldiers, as well as officers, openly calling for the resignation of Mr. Arroyo.    The executive secretary attempted Tuesday to defend himself when he spoke in the House of Representatives. During the coup attempt, he said, he was merely following orders of Mrs. Aquino in her role as commander-in-chief. But Mr. Arroyo's efforts in the House &quot;damaged Cory more than it helped her,&quot; said Mr. Doronila of the Manila Chronicle.    One Philippine cabinet member said he expects a decision on any cabinet reshuffle to be made this week. Mrs. Aquino, asked when she will announce changes, was reported by the Associated Press to have snapped: &quot;You will know.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
