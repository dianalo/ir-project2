A case in point involves U.S. manufacturing.For all the exorbitant executive pay packages and worry overcorporate competitiveness, U.S. manufacturers by and largehave recently managed far better than their foreigncounterparts to hold down costs.   This heartening evidence turns up, among other places, inLabor Department studies of global cost trends. Examined aresuch crucial factors as productivity and hourly compensation.To make them meaningful, the comparisons are based on dataexpressed in terms of the U.S. dollar's value against thevarious other currencies.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   The superior U.S. showing is most striking in comparinglabor costs per unit of output. In the years 1979-85, suchcosts in U.S. factories rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, whilethey fell in 11 of 13 other nations surveyed. The sharpestdecline, 9.6% annually, was in Belgium; only Taiwan showed afaster increase than the U.S. But in 1985-90, in a stunningturnabout, the U.S. alone showed a decline in unit costs,while most other countries experienced double-digitincreases.                                                                                                          More recent comparisons aren't available, but Arthur Neef,chief of foreign labor data at the Bureau of LaborStatistics, suspects that the U.S. has continued to excel.   The U.S. performance partly reflects improvedproductivity. In 1979-85, hourly output in U.S. factoriesrose 2.8% annually, while in 1985-90 the gain accelerated to3.5%. In all but three of the other 13 nations, in contrast,productivity gains slowed in the latter years. Moreover, theU.S. advance in 1985-90 was sharper than in all but three ofthe other countries. In 1979-85, eight countries outpaced theU.S. gain.   The U.S. showing also reflects relatively modest increasesin hourly compensation. This is evident whether the estimatesare made in terms of each particular currency or in U.S.dollar terms.                                                                                                          Hourly pay in U.S. manufacturing rose at an annual rate of3.5% in 1985-90, down sharply from 6.8% in 1979-85. Inlocal-currency terms, only the Netherlands registered aslower increase in 1985-90. And in terms of the U.S. dollar,whose global worth fell sharply after 1985, pay in all theother nations rose far faster than in the U.S. The yearlyincreases ranged from a low of 8.2% in Canada to a high of18.2% in Germany; the Japanese rise was 15%.                                                                                                          The upshot is a startling five-year change in relativecompensation costs. In 1985, the hourly average for U.S.production workers was $13.01. This dwarfed comparablereadings for 32 other countries surveyed in a broader LaborDepartment report. The comparable hourly pay level, forexample, was $6.19 in Britain, $6.43 in Japan, $7.41 inItaly, $7.52 in France, $9.57 in West Germany and $10.80 inCanada.   By 1990, the U.S. hourly rate was $14.77, a modest risefrom five years earlier. Even so, comparable pay levels wereappreciably higher in a dozen countries. The 1990 rate, forinstance, was $15.23 in France, $16.02 in Canada, $16.41 inItaly and $21.53 in Germany. Higher even than the German ratewas Norway's $21.86, up from a 1985 level of $10.60. At$12.43 and $12.64, respectively, the British and Japanese paylevels remained slightly below the U.S. figure.   Looking ahead, U.S. manufacturers seem likely to keepimproving their competitive position. Most analysts expectthe U.S. dollar to remain relatively weak while the economyrecovers steadily, if slowly, from its latest recession. Thiswould help spur productivity and further reduce unit laborcosts generally, as well as in manufacturing. Such costs,it's noteworthy, fell for nearly a year after the 1981-82recession.                                                                                                          Further improvement in U.S. competitiveness would provideadditional muscle for the economy's already strengtheningexport sector. In the process, the nation's deficit-riddenforeign-trade balance would continue to mend, helping theeconomy in general.                                                                                                          In fact, marked progress has already occurred on the tradefront. In the past five years, U.S. merchandise trade withthe European Community, for example, has moved from a deficitof nearly $30 billion to a surplus of nearly $20 billion.Overall, U.S. merchandise trade remains in deficit, to besure. Since 1987, however, the shortfall has narrowed frommore than $150 billion to about $70 billion.   Against such a background, recent calls in Washington,Detroit and elsewhere for stricter protective measures forU.S. industry seem, to say the least, unwarranted. Indeed, ifsuch steps are taken, they may come just when U.S.manufacturers are at last regaining much of their formercompetitive vigor and would stand to reap benefits if tradeflows freely.</TEXT></DOC>
