(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for35 years killed a man who sued a cigarette maker, but he sharesresponsibility for his death and his family doesn't deserve moneyas compensation, a jury decided.   The family of Nathan Henry Horton, who died of lung cancer in1987 at age 50, sought $17 million in the suit against the makerand a regional distributor of Pall Mall cigarettes.   Jurors, half of whom smoke, agreed 9-3 Monday that AmericanTobacco Co. and Greenwood distributor New Deal Tobacco and CandyCo. were partly to blame for Horton's death. Horton's decision tocontinue smoking despite the risk kept them from awarding thefamily a penny.   ``It is possible we could have let down both sides, but thealternatives were this or a hung jury,'' jury foreman David Roachof Oxford said in a telephone interview.   ``This was the only agreement we could come up with. Whether ornot that is better than a hung jury is for other people todecide,'' he said.   The suit sought $2 million in actual damages and $15 million inpunitive damages. The trial, the second in the case, was moved toLafayette County from Holmes County. The first ended in January1988 when the jury deadlocked.   Attorney Don Barrett, who represents Horton's relatives, said hehas filed motions asking Holmes County Circuit Court Judge EugeneBogen to award oome money for actual damages. He also asked for anew trial on the issue of punitive damages.   ``They set out to see justice done, and they are determined tosee it through,'' Barrett said by telephone.   Horton, a Durant homebuilder, began the suit and his familypursued it after his death. His widow, Ella Mae Horton, declined tocomment on the case Tuesday.   Roger Baker, director of communications for Connecticut-basedAmerican Brands Inc., of which American Tobacco Co. is asubsidiary, said Tuesday that the company planned further motionsin the case, but refused to say what they were.   Baker said since the matter is pending in court, the companywouldn't comment further.   In a similar case, a New Jersey jury awarded a widower $400,000in 1988 after deciding a cigarette company was partly responsiblefor his wife's lung cancer death. An appeals court this yearoverturned the award and ordered a new trial.   Defense lawyers argued during the latest trial that Horton knewthe risks of smoking, but chose to continue. Barrett claimed PallMall cigarettes are defective and dangerous.   ``We decided both parties were at fault,'' Roach said Monday,adding that he and eight other jurors ``thought the AmericanTobacco Co. acted in an irresponsible way. It was a very closedecision. We were fairly near a hung jury, frankly.''   Mary Aronson, a Washington analyst who was at the three-weektrial on behalf of tobacco investment clients, said Monday: ``Aslong as damages are not awarded, I believe Wall Street will viewthis as a win for the industry. This was considered the best case(against tobacco companies), yet no award was made.''   Barrett said that the jury verdict should have led to a damageaward.   ``We proved overwhelmingly that he suffered horrible damages,but the jury punted on that,'' Barrett said.</TEXT></DOC>
