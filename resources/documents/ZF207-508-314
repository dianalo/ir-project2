Faurer, president of the Corporation for Open Systems (COS), said.andM;Faurer spoke at the recent national forum on dealing with computer systemssecurity in the information age.andM;OSI security has been delayed by a lack of standards, and only one standard,a general document acting as a foundation to develop OSI standards, exists.andO;Standards work is &quot;progressing very slowly and in an uneven fashion,&quot; Faurersaid.andM;Security work has been fragmented among many groups involved in the sevenlayers and applications for the OSI model, former National Security Agencyhead Faurer said.andP;  COS has formed an OSI Security Task Force, which willexplore security issues and make recommendations on how COS could help speedthe availability of OSI security products.andM;However, participation in other industry and standards groups has been&quot;practically nil,&quot; Faurer said.andP;  &quot;It is unlikely that a coherent set of OSIstandards will be complete enough to satisfy users' needs by the time theyare truly needed,&quot; Faurer said.andM;The Open Systems Interconnection model, with its emphasis on easily allowingusers to communicate across different systems, &quot;is fundamentally at odds withtraditional security objectives,&quot; Faurer said.andM;Security for an open system has to protect the system, yet allow the networkto be a flexible, distributed processing system, Faurer said.andP;  A distributednetwork is &quot;riddled with vulnerabilites,&quot; such as threats from hackers,eavesdroppers and people tampering with the network.andM;&quot;Protective security must be incorporated directly into the open systemhardware and software,&quot; he said.andM;The goal of OSI security is to ensure data on the network is not altered,lost or accessed by unauthorized users, Faurer said.andP;  The sender or theintended receiver would be notified if there was a problem with the data.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
