However, it is anticipatedthat as the cost of these units decreases and their efficiency increases,both technologies will find more commercial applications on earth aswell as in space. The current level of interest in both thermionics andthermoelectrics is very high. While resources shrink and the worldwidedemand for energy grows--along with the cost of conventional fuel supplies--theneed to find alternative sources of power becomes more pressing. Meanwhile,improved conversion efficiencies and lower costs promise to increasethe number of terrestrial commercial applications for both technologies.</TEXT></DOC>
