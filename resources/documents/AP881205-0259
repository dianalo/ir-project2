As it turns out five years later, those fears were unfounded.   The seven Baby Bells, which carved up American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s local operating networks, are among the nation'scorporate giants with assets ranging from $19 billion to $27 billionand investments in a variety of domestic and internationalbusinesses.   In fact, directory publishing has become such a good money-makerthat many of the Bells have removed Yellow Pages from the regulatedside of their businesses and now use those profits to support othercompetitive ventures.   ``They came out of the blocks faster than anyone anticipated,''said Robert Morris III, a San Francisco-based telecommunicationsanalyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   Some say the Baby Bells learned to run before they learned towalk.   Many of their investments in the early years went sour and manyhundreds of millions of dollars were lost. Some analysts said thoseinvestments were a sign that the companies were still acting andthinking like regulated businesses and hadn't yet learned how tocompete in the open market.   ``It's still too early to say the Baby Bells have outgrown thelegacy of what some people say is a bell-shaped head,'' said MichaelDortch, an independent market analyst based in San Francisco.   At Englewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc., Chairman Jack A.MacAllister said his company's failed attempt at expanding itscustomer equipment business beyond its 14-state region taught thecompany something about competition.   ``We didn't understand the market sufficiently and as we got intothe business, the margins disappeared,'' so the company pulled outof the business and took a $100 million writedown in the fourthquarter of 1986, he said.   ``That was hard for us to take, but the good part about it was itset a tenor for our business,'' he said. ``We made up our mind thatas we get into competition there are going to be some times we winand some times we fail, and when we see that we made a mistake,instead of trying to wish it would be better we try to face up tothe mistake.''
