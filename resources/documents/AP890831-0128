(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildlife officials will split the only captivecolony of endangered whooping cranes to reduce the chances ofdisease or disaster wiping out the flock.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said this week that 22 of the54 birds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center will be sent inNovember to the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggsin one basket, literally,'' David Trauger, the Patuxent center'sdeputy director.   ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to separatethe breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do that.''   The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds, known fortheir elaborate courtship dance, under a joint program with Canadianwildlife officials.   A wild flock of the cranes migrates to Texas for the winter fromCanada, 2,400 miles away. This year, 138 made the migration. Beforeconservation efforts began, there were only 21 whooping cranes inTexas in the winter.   Scientists hope that by breeding whooping cranes in captivity,they will be able to establish another flock in the wild.</TEXT></DOC>
