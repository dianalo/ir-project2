Iran also began mobilizing its forces toconfront the United States and Iraq.   Iran took a drubbing this week, losing the peninsula and havingsix vessels sunk or crippled in clashes with the U.S. Navy in thePersian Gulf.   Iraq fired missiles at four Iranian cities on Wednesday, thenoffered to stop its missile attacks at midnight if Iran did thesame. The unofficial truce apparently held on both sides throughthe early morning hours today.   Before the truce began, Iran fired a missile at Kuwait thatreportedly exploded near a U.S.-run oilfield.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inNicosia, said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis andcaptured more than 250 others in the Shemiran mountain region ofKurdistan in northern Iraq on Wednesday.   ``All bases and resistance centers throughout the country are ina complete state of alert,'' Tehran radio said Wednesday.   ``Today our revolution and our heroic nation is faced with theonslaught of the evil triangle of America, Iraq and thereactionaries,'' it added.   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, instructed volunteers to reportto bases throughout the country ``and get ready for departure'' tothe battlefront.   It did not mention numbers, but Iranian leaders have claimed upto 5 million people were trained in the last six months.   At United Nations headquarters in New York, Iran on Wednesdaytold the U.N. Security Council that Iraq used ``cyanide, nerve andmustard gases'' on a ``large scale'' during the battle in the Fawpeninsula.   In a letter to the council released Wednesday, Iran's U.N.envoy, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, said the gases affected ``areasas far as Abadan,'' an Iranian city 40 miles north of the refineryoil town of Faw at the peninsula's southern tip. There was noimmediate comment from Iraq.   Iraqi officials on Wednesday took reporters on a tour of the35-square-mile triangle of the peninsula that Iran captured inFebruary 1986.   Associated Press reporter Salah Nasrawi said he saw Iranianstorage depots containing ammunition and rations left intact,suggesting a speedy Iranian retreat in the 36-hour battle thatended Monday.   It was Iraq's biggest offensive in its 7{-year-old war with Iran.   Iraq claimed its forces were attacking Iranian pockets ofresistance after most Iranian forces were driven back across theShatt-al-Arab waterway to Iran. Iraq said thousands of Iranianswere killed or wounded in the battle.   In the southern gulf, the USS Jack Williams went on alert onWednesday after an Iranian C-130 aircraft ignored a warning as itapproached the missile frigate. ``We are an Iranian warplane, doingour duty,'' the pilot responded.   Minutes after the plane landed at Iran's nearby Abu Musa Island,the frigate went to ``general quarters,'' the Navy's highest alert.   Officers said the alert was a precaution against the possibilitythat the aircraft could have dropped a canister of CS riot controlgas in the area. There was no indication the plane had taken anysuch action.   Previously, the ship received brief reports of Iranianspeedboats attacking merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, thenarrow entry to the gulf at its southern end, and the discovery oftwo mines further north.   The Iraqi News Agency said Iraq would stop bombarding Iraniancities beginning at midnight (4 p.m. EDT Wednesday) as long as Irandid the same.   There was no immediate response from Iran. Hundreds have beenkilled since Feb. 29, when Iran and Iran resumed firing missiles ateach other's cities.   After the announcement but before midnight, Iraq said it firedmissiles into Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and Iran's holy city of Qom.Tehran radio reported a strike on Tehran and said civilians werekilled.   The Lloyd's of London insurers doubled their rates on shipstraveling to the gulf after Monday's U.S.-Iran clashes.   The premium for a two-week voyage to Kuwait doubled on Tuesdayto 2 percent, or about $200,000 on a $10 million hull, said aLloyd's spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The U.S. Navy destroyed two Iranian oil platforms, sank anIranian patrol boat, crippled two frigates and damaged three otherattack boats on Monday. It was the worst U.S.-Iran clash since theNavy buildup last July to curb Iranian attacks on shipping in thegulf.   Iranian TV showed a ceremony in the gulf port of Bushehr, wheremilitary officials lauded the bravery of the crew of the patrolboat Joshan, which the Navy sank. Iran has said 15 of the Joshan'screw were killed and 29 wounded.   ``We are always prepared to deliver strong blows to the enemiesof Islam,'' said the vessel's skipper, identified only as Capt.Maleki.   Kuwait, which Iran accuses of aiding Iraq's war effort, reportedan Iranian missile crashed in its territory on Wednesday butmentioned no casualties.   A source in the gulf, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe missile fell in the desert area of Wafra near an oilfieldoperated by Getty Oil, a U.S. company.
