Baker III says Israel still needs the acquiescence of thePLO to find a partner for peace talks.   Baker, whose recommendation for a suspension of the 18-monthdialogue was approved and announced by President Bush on apolitical trip to Alabama, defended the decision even whileadmitting it would hurt moderate Arabs.   ``We really could not let our pursuit of peace stand in the wayof our commitment to fight terrorism,'' Baker said late Wednesdayen route to East Berlin for talks on German unification.   ``A resort to terrorism would undermine any peace process thatwas unfolding,'' Baker said before a refueling stop here.   And yet, he said the 18-month dialogue that Bush suspended overan aborted attack on Tel Aviv three weeks ago contributed the toU.S. effort to get Israelis to talk to Palestinian Arabs.   And, Baker said, the suspension ordered by Bush because PLOChairman Yasser Arafat did not disavow the attack or punish theperpetrators ``could have an adverse impact'' on Egypt and othermoderates, including some Palestinians.   Baker stressed they will keep trying to persuade Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's government to approve U.S. terms fortalks with Palestinians.   ``We were not seeking a dialogue between Israel and the PLO,''Baker said.   But, he said, ``everybody recognizes that without PLOacquiescence there won't be a dialogue for Israel. They have beenseeking to develop one for 22 years (since the 1967 Mideast war)and none has come forward. That points up the way in which thisdialogue could contribute toward progress toward a peace process.''   The last Israeli government, also headed by Shamir, refused toaccept Baker's formula for talks in March and then collapsed. Thenew government formed by Shamir has laid down even stiffer termsfor talking to Palestinians.   But senior U.S. officials on Baker's plane said the formulawould not be changed. ``We're not prepared to embrace ideas thatare non-starters,'' said one official who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The U.S. break with the PLO, long sought by Israel, could putpressure on Shamir to go along with Baker's formula, which includesparticipation in the talks of Palestinians deported from the WestBank.   ``We've not got a formal answer to our question,'' a U.S.official said. ``Now if we get a no, what is the reason for it?OK?''</TEXT></DOC>
