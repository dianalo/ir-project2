 Shneiderman [8] described five primary interactionstyles available to a software designer: (1) form fill-in, where the usermoves from field to field on the screen to enter the necessary or requesteddata; (2) menu selection, where the user chooses from among a set of optionsdisplayed on the screen; (3) command language, where commands are entereddirectly into the system; (4) direct manipulation, where the user moves thecursor around the screen with a pointing device in order to manipulate arepresentation of some action or object; and (5) natural language, which ismuch like a command language except that it uses a spoken language such asEnglish.andP;  Natural languages have a much less structured syntax than docommand languages.andM;Although each of these styles has advantages and disadvantages, the idea of arestricted natural language interface is very appealing because naturallanguage is the way in which humans communicate with each other, Moreover, itconforms more closely with a user's prior knowledge and human intuition.andO;Despite the intuitive appeal of a natural language interface, it has beenargued that a language like English has too many ambiguities to be useful forcommunicating with computers [3] .Indeed, there is little experimental datasupporting the efficacy of a restricted natural language interface.andP;  Studiesthat have compared restricted natural language interfaces to other styles ofinterface have been generally negative.andP;  For example, Small and Weldon [9]compared a restricted natural language interface with a command language,SQL, in a database task and found that the command language interface led tobetter performance.andP;  Similarly, Hauptmann and Green [2] compared a restrictednatural language interface, a command language interface, and a menu driveninterface using a business graphics package and found no significantdifferences on any of several criteria.andP;  Although these findings should betaken as a warning against the uncritical acceptance of a restricted naturallanguage interface, there is clearly a need for more data on this importanttopic.andM;The optimal interface style may differ depending on the experience of theuser [8].andP;  For example, command language interfaces can be very intimidatingto novice users yet very powerful and efficient for experienced users.andP;  Itseems likely that if there are advantages to restricted natural languageinterfaces, they are most likely to be found with novice users.andP;  The presentresearch compared the performance of novices using a restricted naturallanguage interface (Lotus HAL) with the performance of novices using a moretraditional interface (Lotus 1-2-3).andP;  Lotus 1-2-3, the most widely usedspreadsheet package, uses a combination of the command language, menuselection, and direct manipulation interface styles.andP;  Users have the choiceof selecting commands from a hierarchy of menus or by issuing them from thekeyboard.andP;  As each choice is made, the user descends through a hierarchy ofmenus until either an action occurs or the system requires the user to enterfurther information necessary to the completion of the task.andP;  For example, toerase a worksheet one could choose the following options from a hierarchy ofandM;menu choices:andM;/andM;WorksheetandM;EraseandM;YesandM;or one could type the command sequence /WEY.andP;  Each character (with theexception of the slash) represents the first character of a command.andO;Immediately after a character is entered, the set of commands that becomeavailable is displayed.andP;  Cell ranges can be specified by pointing andselecting, which is a form of direct manip ulation.andM;The experienced user of 1-2-3 knows how to move quickly through the commandhierarchy to achieve a goal, but the novice user may get lost before the goalis ever reached.andP;  This complexity seems to be in violation of what Maass [5]has termed system transparency, which requires that the actions necessary tosolve a problem do not interfere with the mental processes of that solution.andM;Lotus HAL, a program that works with Lotus 1-2-3, allows commands thatroughly approximate English sentences or phrases.andP;  For example, to erase theentire worksheet, the user could enter the phrase &quot;Erase all&quot; and thenconfirm the command by typing &quot;Y&quot; for Yes.andP;  Thus the commands in Lotus HALtend to be familiar everyday words.andM;One characteristic of restricted natural languages is that they provide morethan one way to accomplish the same thing.andP;  In many cases Lotus HAL providesthis capability.andP;  For example, &quot;erase this worksheet&quot; and &quot;erase worksheet&quot;have the same effect as &quot;erase all.&quot; Similarly, &quot;enter 1000 then grow at 5%across&quot; works the same as &quot;enter 1000 and then project at 5% across.&quot;andO;However, &quot;enter 1000 and then increase at 5% across&quot; will not be accepted.andM;In addition to allowing more than one way to say the same thing, restrictednatural languages use context to determine the meaning of a phrase orcommand.andP;  Lotus HAL can do this also, albeit to a limited extent.andP;  The maincontext used by Lotus HAL is provided by row and column labels, For example,the range of cells affected by the command &quot;Enter 1000 then project at 10%across&quot; is determined by the placement of the column labels (such as themonths of the year).andM;As discussed by Ogden and Brooks [7], formal and natural languages vary alonga continuum.andP;  Since Lotus HAL has a much more limited vocabulary and a muchmore restrictive syntax than languages such as English, it should beconsidered to lie somewhere along the continuum of naturalness rather than asa true natural language.andM;METHODandM;Forty-two subjects recruited by an employment agency participated.andP;  One groupof 22 subjects used Lotus 1-2-3 and the other group used Lotus HAL.andP;  Thesubjects had little or no experience working with microcomputers orspreadsheets and none of the subjects had any experience with either Lotus1-2-3 or Lotus HAL.andM;Twenty Sperry and two Compaq computers were used.andP;  Each was connected to oneof several brands of dot-matrix printers.andP;  The instructor used a Toshibaportable.andP;  The screen from this computer was projected onto a large whitescreen with a Sony projector.andM;The experimental sessions took three days.andP;  The first day and a half was usedfor training and the remaining day and a half for testing.andP;  The Lotus 1-2-3sessions were held on three successive days of one week; the Lotus HALsessions were held on the same days of the following week.andP;  Subjectsparticipated from 8:00 AM until 5:00 PM with an hour break for lunch andfifteen-minute breaks in the morning and afternoon.andM;The training sessions were conducted by the first author who had hadconsiderable experience training people on Lotus 1-2-3 and on Lotus HAL at aLotus Authorized Training Company.andP;  The training consisted of combinations oflectures and practice on problems.andP;  Each subject was given an instructionmanual that consisted of step-by-step instructions on the topics covered.andO;Numerous illustrations of what the subject's screen should look like wereincluded.andM;During lectures, the instructor's computer screen was projected at the frontof the room with subjects following along by typing into computers at theirseats.andP;  The other three authors assisted during lectures by helping peopleindividually who were falling behind.andP;  During the practice problem-solvingsessions all four authors gave assistance as it was needed.andM;The first day consisted entirely of lectures.andP;  The basics of usingspreadsheets were covered (see the accompanying box for a summary of thetopics covered).andP;  At the beginning of the second day, subjects were given 45minutes to work (without assistance) the last problem that they worked alongwith the instructor the day before.andP;  This problem is called the budgetproblem and is shown in Appendix 1.andP;  Appendix I also shows the specifickeystrokes needed to create this spreadsheet for both Lotus 1-2-3 and LotusHAL.andM;In the afternoon session of the second day and in the morning and afternoonsessions of the third day, subjects were asked to solve problem setsconsisting of 13 problems.andP;  The first 12 problems of each problem set wereidentical and were ordered according to difficulty.andP;  The last problem in eachof the sets was unique and relatively difficult to solve.andP;  For all threeproblem sets subjects could use their instruction manuals.andP;  Subjects weregiven 2 hours and 45 minutes to work on the problems and had a 15-minutebreak in the middle.andP;  After finishing each problem, subjects did a &quot;printscreen&quot; and then saved the file to disk.andP;  Three examples of the problems usedare shown in Appendix 11.andM;After the subjects completed their work on the first problem set (worked inthe afternoon of the second day), the instructor spent one hour showing howto solve the last problem in this problem set (which was not repeated).andP;  Thisproblem provided a review of the various topics covered in the trainingsessions.andP;  Questions about other specific problems in Problem Set 1 were notanswered.andM;In the first hour of the third day, the Wonderlic Personnel Test [10] wasadministered.andP;  The Wonderlic is a test of general intelligence.andP;  In the lasthour of the third day demographic information and information about subjects'subjective impressions of the spreadsheet software they used were gatheredthrough the use of a questionnaire.andM;RESULTSandM;For personal reasons, three of the subjects in the Lotus HAL group did notreturn on the third day.andP;  Two of these people agreed to take the WonderlicPersonnel Test and to fill out the questionnaire at a later time.andP;  Therefore,data on the budget problem were available for all 20 Lotus HAL subjects; dataon the problem sets were available for 17 subjects, and data on thequestionnaires were available for 19 subjects.andM;The disk containing the data for one of the subjects in the Lotus 1-2-3 groupcould not be read and therefore this subject's data could not be used in theanalysis of the problem sets.andP;  There were thus 22 Lotus 1-2-3 subjectsworking on the budget problem and filling out the questionnaires, but only 21for the problem sets.andM;Demographic InformationandM;As can be seen in Table 1, the demographics of the Lotus 1-2-3 and Lotus HALgroups were quite similar.andP;  The typical subject was college educated andabout 36 years old.andP;  The Lotus 1-2-3 group scored somewhat higher than didthe Lotus HAL group on the Wonderlic although the difference was notsignificant, t(39) = 1.68, p = .10.andM;User AcceptanceandM;Figure 1 shows the mean response to each of the user acceptance questions;Table 11 shows the exact wording of each question, the upper and lower verbalanchors, and a two-tailed significance test of the group difference.andM;It is apparent from Figure 1 that user acceptance was higher for Lotus HALthan for Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  The difference was pronounced and significant for howmuch subjects &quot;liked the product&quot; and how &quot;suitable they thought the productwas for their needs.&quot; As shown in Table II the differences on the otherquestions did not reach conventional levels of significance.andM;Budget ProblemandM;On the first day of training all subjects worked the budget problem with helpas needed.andP;  At the beginning of the second day, subjects were given 45minutes to work the same budget problem without help.andP;  Problems were scoredin terms of whether or not they were completed correctly.andM;In the Lotus HAL group 14 of 20 (70 percent) completed the problem correctlywhereas only 8 of 22 (36 percent) of the subjects in the Lotus 1-2-3 groupcompleted the problem correctly (see Figure 2).andP;  The difference inproportions is significant, z = 2.18, p = .029 (two-tailed).andM;Performance on Problem SetsandM;Each problem completed was scored on a three-point scale in terms of twocriteria: correctness of the answers and correctness of the formatting.andP;  Ascore of 1 was given if the problem was correct or correct except for a veryminor error such as a misspelling of a label.andP;  A score of 2 was given if theproblem had a minor error but was otherwise correct, A score of 3 was givenif any serious error or two or more minor errors were made.andP;  Three judgesindependently scored each problem and a fourth judge checked the disk filesto verify that formulas were used where required.andP;  For each session thenumber of problems completed and meeting a strict criterion of a mean score(across the three judges) of 1.5 or less and the number of problems completedand meeting a loose criterion of 2.0 or less were computed.andP;  The agreementacross judges on these measures was extremely high as can be seen by anexamination of Table Ill that shows Chronbach's alpha for the format scoresand the answer scores as a function of problem set and criterion strictness.andM;Figure 3 shows the mean scores across problem sets for the answers andformats, respectively, for the loose criterion.andP;  Considering the answersfirst, an examination of Figure 3 shows that overall the Lotus HAL groupoutperformed the Lotus 1-2-3 group.andP;  An analysis of covariance (withWonderlic scores as covariates) revealed a significant main effect ofInterface (Lotus HAL versus Lotus 1-2-3), F(1, 35) = 4.57, p = .040.andP;  Thus,summing across all problem sets, performance was better with Lotus HAL thanwith Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  The interface x problem set interaction was marginallysignificant, F (2, 7 2) = 2.62, p = .080.andP;  Separate analyses of covariancewere done for each problem set and the effect of interface was significantfor problem set 2, F (1, 35) = 5.03, p = .031 and for problem set 3, F (1,35) = 5.73, p = .022, but not for problem set 1, F (1, 35) = 1.39, p = .247.andM;Figure 3 also shows that the same pattern of performance was obtained forformat although the effects were not as pronounced.andP;  The main effect ofinterface was not significant, F (1, 35) = 1.35, p = .253, but the interfacex problem set interaction was significant, F (2, 72) = 3.73, p = .029.andP;  Theeffect of interface was not significant for any of the problem sets, however,F (1, 35) = 0.01, p = .962, F (1, 35) = 1.62, p = .211, and F(1, 35) = 2.84,p = .101 for problem sets 1-3, respectively.andM;Figure 4 shows the mean scores across problem sets for the answers andformats, respectively, for the strict criterion.andP;  An inspection of thisfigure reveals that the effects of interface and problem set when performancewas evaluated in terms of the strict criterion were similar to when they wereevaluated in terms of the loose criterion.andP;  Although the main effect ofinterface only approached conventional levels of significance, F (1, 35) =3.91, p = .056, the interface x problem set interaction was significant, F(2,72) = 3.37, p = .040.andP;  The analysis of covariance done separately for eachproblem set revealed a significant effect for the third problem set, F(1, 35)= 6.77, p = .014 but not for either the first problem set, F (1, 35) = .68, p= .414 or the second problem set, F (1, 35) = 3.55, p = .068.andM;Figure 4 also shows that when scored according to the strict criterion, thenumber of problems formatted correctly was slightly higher for the Lotus HALgroup than for the Lotus 1-2-3 group.andP;  Neither the main effect of interface,F (1, 35) = .59, p = .448, nor the interface X problem set interaction, F (2,72) = 2.38, p = .100 were significant.andP;  The effect of interface did notapproach significance for any of the problem sets, F (1, 35) = .05, p = .832; F (1, 3 5) = .12, p = .7 31; and F (1, 35) = 1.82, p = .186 for problemsets 1-3, respectively.andM;DISCUSSIONandM;The results show a clear and consistent advantage in favor of Lotus HAL'srestricted natural language interface.andP;  Statistically significant advantagesrelative to Lotus 1-2-3 were obtained in both user acceptance andperformance.andM;The differences in performance were substantial on many of the measuresemployed.andP;  For example, the probability of solving the budget problem wasalmost twice as high for the Lotus HAL group as it was for the Lotus 1-2-3group.andP;  Performance on the problem sets was also much higher for Lotus HAL.andO;Overall this group obtained the correct answer on 20 percent more problemswhen problems were scored according to a loose criterion and 25 percent moreproblems when problems were scored according to a strict criterion.andM;The difference between the Lotus HAL group and the Lotus 1-2-3 group wasnegligible on the first problem set, yet quite large on the second and thirdproblem sets.andP;  One explanation for this pattern of results is that as thetime spent in solution formulation decreases (which happens as subjectsrework the same problem they solved or attempted to solve in an earliersession), the ease and/or speed with which subjects can use the interfacebecomes relatively more important.andP;  Thus any advantage in Lotus HAL'sinterface would become more important for the later problem sets as subjectsbecome familiar with the problems.andP;  A second possible explanation is that theshape of the learning curve for Lotus HAL and Lotus 1-2-3 is simplydifferent.andP;  When left to solve problems on their own, neither user's of LotusHAL nor users of Lotus 1-2-3 proceed very quickly at first.andP;  The presentresults suggest that after a few hours of unassisted practice, users of LotusHAL become much more proficient whereas most of the users of Lotus 1-2-3 makeprogress at a slower rate.andM;An interesting question for future research is whether the asymptotic levelof the Lotus 1-2-3 performance is as high as the asymptotic level for LotusHAL.andP;  In other words, does Lotus 1-2-3 performance ever catch back up withthe Lotus HAL performance? One way to approach this issue is to apply thekeystroke level model of Card et al.andP;  [1].andP;  A more definitive answer could beobtained empirically by extending the length of training in an experimentsuch as the present one.andM;Given that our results show that the performance of novice users with LotusHAL is superior to the performance of novice users with Lotus 1-2-3, animportant next step is to determine exactly what it is about the Lotus HALinterface that led to superior performance.andP;  One possibility is that LotusHAL's commands are more like English and thus more familiar.andP;  Supporting thispossibility, Ledgard et al.andP;  14] found that changing a text editor's commandsto become more like English led to a substantial increase in performance.andO;These investigators changed the wording of the commands by, for example,substitutingandM;FORWARD TO &quot;TOOTH&quot;andM;forandM;FIND:/TOOTH/andM;but otherwise made no changes in the operation of the program.andM;Perhaps more important than the actual names of commands is the fact thatLotus HAL uses context to interpret a command.andP;  This allows the user to giveinstructions at a relatively high level rather than as a series of detailedcommands.andP;  For example, suppose a user wishes to specify that a row ofnumbers is to start at 1000 and increase at a constant rate of 12 percentacross columns.andP;  In Lotus 1-2-3 the user must specify a formula and then withwhat to the novice is a complicated series of actions, indicate the range ofcells to which the formula applies and copy it from one cell to the range ofcells.andP;  In Lotus HAL the user moves the cell pointer to the first cell of therow in which the results are to be placed and types:andM;ENTER 1000 THEN PROJECT AT 12% ACROSSandM;Lotus HAL determines where the formula begins and how far it is to extend bythe context provided by the column labels.andP;  Similarly, in Lotus HALexpressions such asandM;PROFITS = REVENUES - EXPENSESandM;can be used without going through the numerous steps required in Lotus 1-2-3to specify cell ranges since the range of cells to which the variables referare determined from context.andM;It is not clear whether Lotus HAL was better because it is more like Englishor because it takes advantage of context, but we suspect the latter is moreimportant.andP;  First, the command names used in Lotus 1-2-3 are themselves notmuch more different from English than are Lotus HAL's and are not nearly asarcane as the text editor studied by Ledgard et al.andP;  [4].andP;  Second, thehierarchical menu system used by Lotus 1-2-3 is welldesigned in that it showsthe names of all possible commands at each point in the sequence.andP;  Finally,studies failing to find an advantage for a restricted natural languageinterface [2, 9] have used interfaces that are like English but not strong ontheir ability to take advantage of context.andP;  This may account for thedifference between their results and ours.andM;It should be emphasized that the present results should not be generalizeduncritically to more advanced users, more complex problems, or applicationsother than spreadsheets.andP;  The major criticism of a restricted naturallanguage interface is that it is too ambiguous [3].andP;  A natural languageinterface will be successful to the extent that ambiguity can be resolved bycontext.andP;  For problems of easy-to-intermediate levels of difficulty, LotusHAL appears to be able to determine successfully the meaning of user'scommands.andP;  Perhaps with more difficult problems the potential ambiguity wouldbe more serious, for example, situations in which the operation of a macrocan be greatly affected by the presence of one cell label.andM;To some, it may seem obvious that the Lotus HAL interface would result inbetter performance than would the Lotus 1-2-3 interface.andP;  However, what seemsobvious to one observer may seem improbable to another.andP;  In fact, the use ofa restricted natural language interface has on occasion been met withskepticism [6].andM;Our research indicates that there are circumstances in which a restrictednatural language interface can be beneficial.andP;  It specifically shows that theinterface to HAL makes it easier to learn; it does not address whether it iseasier to use for people with considerable experience with spreadsheets.andO;Further, the present research does not shed light on exactly why theperformance with the restricted natural language interface was superior.andP;  Twoavenues for future research seem the most promising.andP;  First, under whatconditions does a restricted natural language interface allow superiorperformance? Of particular importance is whether it is useful outside thedomain of spreadsheets.andP;  For example, it would be valuable to know whetherprograms such as Intelligent Assistant, which contain a restricted naturallanguage interface for the database program Qandamp;A, provide the same advantagethat Lotus HAL does.andP;  Second, when a restricted natural language is superior,what is it about the interface that allows it to be so? Is it that arestricted natural language takes context into account, that it allows manyways of requesting the same thing, that it seems natural and nonthreatening,or is it something else  altogether?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
