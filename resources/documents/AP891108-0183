(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican J. Marshall Coleman saidWednesday he would demand a recount of the closest governor's racein Virginia history, but Democrat L. Douglas Wilder was alreadyrelishing the historical dimensions of his apparent victory.   ``It starts coming home to you, something happened last night,''Wilder said at a news conference the morning after he claimedvictory as the nation's first black elected governor.   Just what happened was not absolutely certain, although Wilderstill clung to a lead of 5,500 votes out of more than 1.7 millioncast. With all 1,967 precincts reporting, unofficial results showedWilder with 896,283 votes to Coleman's 890,750 votes.   Because the margin was within one-half of 1 percent, Coleman hadthe right under state law to demand a recount. At a news conferencein McLean, Va., he said he would do so.   ``The outcome, although still in doubt, has given me aresponsibility, for plainly I am the trustee of the votes of morethan 880,000 Virginians who supported me in this contest. I have aresponsibility to them and to all Virginians to ensure the personwith the most votes is declared the winner,'' Coleman said.   ``I congratulate Doug Wilder on a hard-fought campaign and if heis certified the winner, he will have my full support,'' he added.   But, he continued, ``For the good of the next governor, whoeverhe may be, and for the good of the commonwealth, it is essentialthat there be complete confidence in the integrity and accuracy ofthe results.''   The State Board of Elections will meet Nov. 27 to certify theresults of Tuesday's vote, which board Secretary Susan Fitz-Hughsaid was the closest contest for governor ever in Virginia.   Coleman will have until Dec. 7 to request a recount. Mrs.Fitz-Hugh said as far as she knew, no such recount had ever beenconducted in a statewide election. She had no estimate of how longit would take to tally the votes a second time.   Wilder's white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorneygeneral, Donald S. Beyer Jr. and Mary Sue Terry, both won bysubstantial margins, prompting questions about the role that raceplayed in the campaign.   But Wilder dismissed such speculation, saying the electionanswered ``the subliminal question'' about the importance of race.   ``I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the resultsbecause I was elected,'' he said. ``I said if I won by 50.1 percentof the vote, I'd be happy. That's why you see me happy.''   Wilder also dismissed questions about whether people were sayingone thing in pre-election polls and exit polls, all of which showedhim leading by a comfortable margin, and then voting a different way.   The same polls showed Beyer well behind his Republican opponent,Edwina P. ``Eddy'' Dalton, Wilder said. Beyer won 54 percent to 46percent.   Wilder also said he intended to serve as a full-time governorrather than get involved in national Democratic politics as apotential black rival to Jesse Jackson.   ``I don't think you're going to see me being in confrontationwith anybody,'' he said. However, he added that if he were asked andhad the time, he would campaign for Democrats in other states. Healso would not rule out a bid for federal office in the future.   He said his victory showed national party leaders that``Democrats don't need to make special appeals to special groups''because mainstream candidates can win.   ``The mandate is that in Virginia, we are prepared to move and wedon't care what that person looks like,'' he said.   Wilder, who used Coleman's opposition to abortion in televisionadvertising, said it would be wrong to say that his candidacy wasbased on that single issue.   But he said the vote showed that Virginians want to move forwardrather than ``turn the clock back'' to when abortions were illegal.And he criticized President Bush's decision to veto Medicaid fundingfor abortions.</TEXT></DOC>
