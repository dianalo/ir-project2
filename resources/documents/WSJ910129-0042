Bruce G. Sundlun.   The move comes as the governor and state legislatorscontinue to debate the form of a proposed bailout bill forthe 14 banks and credit unions that remain closed in the wakeof the failure of the Rhode Island Share andamp; Indemnity Corp., aprivate deposit insurer. Deposits of about $1.3 billion in359,000 accounts remain frozen.</LP><TEXT>   Under the interim payment plan, depositors at four banksand five credit unions will get as much as $10,000 fromchecking accounts, and half of all savings accounts up to$2,500, totaling about $35 million. But officials cautionedthat not all depositors would receive as much as theguidelines set by the state. &quot;How much money each depositorreceives will be determined by how much liquid cash eachinstitution has on hand,&quot; Gov. Sundlun said.   The participating banks are Pier, Savers and UnionDeposit. The credit unions are Central, Brown University,Davisville, Rhode Island Central and Marquette. Banner Loan andamp;Investment, a Marquette unit, also will make partialpayments.   Gov. Sundlun has proposed creating a state agency to mergeand liquidate the closed credit unions and banks and wouldguarantee depositors return of as much as $100,000. Analternative proposed by some legislators would convert afraction of deposits into equity to reopen some institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
