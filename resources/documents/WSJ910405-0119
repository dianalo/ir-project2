After all, as banks and insurers and government agenciesforeclose on the nation's buildings, they have to hiresomebody to cut the grass, collect the rent and fix theplumbing. Seems like a great way to make a buck in realestate, now that ownership has gone out of style.</LP><TEXT>   Not quite.   &quot;I've been in the business for 20 years, and this is themost viciously competitive marketplace I've ever operatedin,&quot; says Edward Ducoff, owner of Pace Realty Inc., whichmanages about 6,000 apartment units in North Texas forthird-party owners. &quot;It's as common as rain for people to getsqueezed out.&quot;   Indeed, a little-recognized side effect of the real estatebust has been a severe shakeup of the property-managementbusiness. Once a tidy little cottage industry that thrived onthe crumbs tossed out by real estate moguls, propertymanagement has become treacherous. Some companies havealready folded, while others are seeking merger partners andcinching their belts to survive. Unable to crack thebureaucratic code at government agencies, many are trying tocarve out a niche serving only private-sector owners.   Mostly, it's a problem of supply and demand. So many newplayers are flocking to the field -- including cash-strappedbehemoths such as Trammell Crow Co. -- that they areoverwhelming even the vast supplies of new properties comingup for bid. Membership in the Institute of Real EstateManagement, a nationwide trade group, has grown 70% since1981, to over 9,000.   The new property owners, such as the government'sResolution Trust Corp., are taking advantage of the imbalanceto demand a higher degree of service for lower fees. And eventhose companies that obtain a contract often find themselvesout on the street again as soon as the building is sold.   &quot;It seems as if at the drop of a hat and a third of a dimeowners will switch management companies,&quot; says Nena Gang,executive vice president of the Bay Area ApartmentAssociation in Tampa, Fla.   Typical of the current property-management situation isthe story of Melanie Morrison. Her seven-year-old company,Eagle Property Management Inc. of Mesa, Arizona, nearlydoubled to 110 employees in 1989, when it won contracts tomanage 13 apartment complexes owned by three insolvent localthrifts.   Eagle immediately set to work refurbishing the neglectedbuildings to ready them for sale, repainting common areas andrestoring boilers, among other things. It also dealt withproblem tenants who were dragging down property values.   The moves worked -- too well. The apartments filled up,and the thrifts were able to sell them, in some cases for theentire amount of the mortgage. Unfortunately, the new ownersalready had in-house management personnel, and Eagle was outof a job. Now, the company has shrunk back to 70 employeesand is trying to limit its reliance on bank and Sandamp;L property.   &quot;When you take bank properties, if you do too good a jobyou put yourself out of business,&quot; says Ms. Morrison.   The big players have their problems, too. In the past yearor so, nearly a dozen large developers and insurancecompanies have announced forays into property management forthird parties -- so-called fee management. But results havebeen generally discouraging. For example, Dallas real estatesyndicator Craig Hall has stopped bidding on third-partycontracts altogether, saying that &quot;the industry has becomevery competitive and very mediocre in terms of quality.&quot;   It is for the little operators, however, that life hasbecome particularly precarious -- operators like RichardRackley, who owns Kent Properties Ltd. in Colorado Springs,Colo.   Mr. Rackley formed his property-management concern threeyears ago to take up the slack from his faltering real estatebrokerage business. He manages about 275,000 square feet ofcommercial space, mostly industrial parks. But some of thecontracts came from Sandamp;Ls that have since been taken over byResolution Trust, and he wonders if he'll be kept on. &quot;I canbe fired any minute of any day,&quot; he says. &quot;It's anything buta gold mine.&quot;   Even those who win coveted Resolution Trust contracts maywish they hadn't. Most fee arrangements call for managers tobe paid a percentage of gross rent receipts, with bonuses forbringing in new tenants. Low occupancy levels make the basepay paltry to begin with. And cutthroat competition amongmanagement firms shaves fees even further. This means thatmany Resolution Trust contractors can't even break even,according to industry executives.   One manager in the Southwest tells of losing a contractfor a government project to a competitor who requested a feeof just 1.5% of gross receipts, or half his own bid. &quot;Ipersonally don't think they can make money&quot; at 1.5%, he says.Others in the industry refuse even to bid on government jobs,focusing instead on private-sector owners who are willing topay a bit more for quality work.   Lee Fischer, a former Trammell Crow executive who fouryears ago formed his own management company, has carved out aniche catering mostly to a big Seattle savings bank with alot of Texas real estate. Mr. Fischer says he more thandoubled occupancy at one atrium-style office building to 76%and installed a state-of-the-art air-conditioning system thatcools the building with ice made at night. Because nightelectrical rates are lower, the system produces at least a20% return on the investment -- and kudos from the client.   Still, even Mr. Fischer isn't relaxing. Worried about theday when his projects are sold, he is spending much of histime on &quot;strategic planning&quot; -- for example, exploringmergers with other companies. He figures that within 18months, most property-management companies will beunprofitable because of losses in revenue, and that as few asone in 15 recent entries to the market will survive. Hisprediction: &quot;There will be a classic shakeout, just like inthe airline industry.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
