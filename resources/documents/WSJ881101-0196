In more than half a dozen rulings over the past three years, the appellate judges have hammered lawyers who dared violate the court's 50-page limit on briefs. Though the rule applies throughout the federal appeals court system, the Chicago bench may be its toughest defender.    Attorneys have been downright tricky in trying to get around the rule. One tried numbering a portion of his brief in Roman numerals. The appeals court painstakingly explained that 50 &quot;means total pages after the table of contents, not just pages with Arabic numerals.&quot;    Another lawyer slipped part of his argument into a separately numbered appendix. &quot;Litigants should not attempt to hide excess text in either an appendix or in footnotes,&quot; the court admonished.    Nor does the appeals court tolerate whining. &quot;Litigants frequently assert the necessity of additional pages to represent their clients adequately. Overly long briefs, however, may actually hurt a party's case, making it 'far more likely that meritorious arguments will be lost amid the mass of detail,'&quot; the judges wrote, quoting one of the court's previous rulings on the matter.    In rare cases, lawyers are allowed to write more than 50 pages, but they must obtain the court's permission. &quot;Litigants who file briefs of more than 50 pages without seeking leave of court should beware,&quot; the judges caution. &quot;It is more difficult to obtain forgiveness than permission.&quot;    Consider the case of lawyers for Westinghouse Electric Corp., who were denied permission to file more than 50 pages. Undeterred, the lawyers disregarded spacing, margin and typeface requirements -- set forth in a separate appeals-court rule -- &quot;to stuff a 70-page brief into 50 pages,&quot; the judges wrote. &quot;When we required Westinghouse to file a brief complying with the rules, counsel responded by moving gobs of text into single-spaced footnotes, thereby leaving essentially the same number of words in the brief.    &quot;The lawyers, caught with their hands in the cookie jar, have apologized and promised not to play the same trick on us again,&quot; the court wrote.    Just to be sure, the judges fined the lawyers $1,000. </TEXT></DOC>
