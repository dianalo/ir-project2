Threeprimary color/thermal units are discernible: (1) bright red dust stormdeposits; (2) brown materials, which may be indurated; and (3) dark,but less red materials which may be composed of medium sand size-rangelithic fragments. The surficial units exposed over the study area arejudged to represent mixed eolian deposits, largely decoupled from thebedrock underneath. 44 references.</TEXT></DOC>
