The official Xinhua news agency said Sun Enterprises Ltd. ofJapan beat out five other firms to win rights to use a12,900-square-meter (139,320-square-foot) plot in Shanghai'sHongqiao economic development zone for 50 years.   The report said the company will pay 104.16 million yuan ($28million) for the land. It plans to construct apartment and officebuildings, restaurants, stores and recreational facilities there.   The selling of land-use rights is the latest, and one of themore controversial, measures taken by the Beijing government toraise badly needed capital for economic development.   Last month the city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone acrossthe border from Hong Kong, held China's first land auction, withtwo Chinese companies winning the bidding for property developmentsites.   Land in socialist China technically all belongs to the state,but economists are now arguing that a market in land-use rightswill bring in needed capital, bring about a more efficient use ofland and speed up urban development.   In the countryside, family farms that were rehabilitated withthe start of agricultural reforms in 1979 usually have 10- to15-year contracts for farming a plot of land, but normally do notpay rent to the state.   In the cities, most Chinese factories and buildings occupy landwithout charge for unlimited periods.   The National People's Congress, China's legislature, paved theway for land-use sales last April when it amended the constitutionto eliminate a prohibition against leasing land and added thesentence ``land-use rights according to legal regulation can betransferred.''   Some rural areas now allow residents not using their land tolease it to more ambitious farmers needing larger tracts. Thegovernment at the end of last year also named seven urban areasthat may experiment with land-use sales: Shenzhen, Shanghai,Canton, Tianjin, Hainan, Fuzhou and Xiamen.   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, however, stressedrecently that public ownership will remain dominant in China. Hisstatement appeared to be meant to assuage other party leadersworried that China was losing its socialist character with theemergence of thriving private enterprises and the selling of stateland.</TEXT></DOC>
