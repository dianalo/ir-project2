Gen. Charles Horner, says the war taught him two mainlessons -- the importance of stealth technology, and the needto defend against ballistic missiles, such as Scuds. So guesswhat the U.S. House of Representatives is trying to gut inthis year's defense budget? Stealth and missile defenses.   We'd have thought the Gulf War also taught that the worldremains a dangerous place, even with a declining Sovietthreat; that high-tech weapons are an important Americanstrategic advantage; that the Pentagon's war-fightingstrategy has some basis in reality after all. But the Houseis acting as if nothing much happened in Iraq, as if Scudsnever flew and all future threats have vanished. For all therethinking in Congress, the Pentagon might as well have lostthe war.</LP><TEXT>   This is no mere caricature; the Members are only too happyto say it themselves. &quot;The Persian Gulf War hasn't reallyentered into this year's debate over the fate of majorweapons,&quot; says Ron Dellums, the Berkeley Democrat. AddsRepublican William Dickinson of Alabama: &quot;Desert Storm isbehind us, and the defense drawdown train has left thestation.&quot;   The four-star general driving this train is Les Aspin,chairman of the traveling circus known as the House ArmedServices Committee. General Aspin knows that defense spendingin the House is less about war than about ideology andpork-barrel politics. The chairman has one staff member,Larry Smith, devoted mainly to the task of &quot;Member services.&quot;His job is to keep the chairman informed of the Members' wishlists, which Mr. Aspin then dutifully tries to meet to keephis troops happy. This year Mr. Smith has been workingovertime.   Ron Dellums, for example, has long been on a crusadeagainst the B-2 Stealth bomber, and General Aspin now agrees.He rallied his committee to slash B-2 spending by two-thirdsto $1.6 billion and a future total of only 15 bombers, thoughthe Pentagon wants 75. Mr. Aspin apparently isn't impressedthat the Stealth fighter, the F-117, flew just about everysensitive mission over Baghdad without a single loss.   The B-2 is more expensive than it should have been, butmost of its research costs are already paid for. It's astealthy craft that can carry a huge payload as far as 10,000miles on a single refueling -- but projecting U.S. power isnot a House priority.   Nor it would seem is anti-missile defense. General Aspin'scommittee slashed the Pentagon's SDI request to $2.7 billion(from $4.5 billion) and refused any money for space-basedinterceptors known as Brilliant Pebbles. General Aspin claimsto still support &quot;theater&quot; defenses such as the Patriot, butas Scuds proliferate and grow more sophisticated, defensesmust do the same. A defense based in space can protectagainst missiles launched from anywhere, while a &quot;theater&quot;defense is by definition confined to a specific location.   Stealing from SDI and the B-2 means General Aspin has moremoney to buy his committee's votes. Mississippi DemocratSonny Montgomery grabbed more than $1 billion for thereserves, including $280 million for National Guard armories(in some 100 congressional districts) that the Pentagondoesn't want. The Pentagon has to deactivate four armydivisions through 1993, but the reserves supposedly assignedto those divisions will live on. Behold the reserves' newLost Brigades.   The Ohio and Michigan delegations won $270 million for 60more M-1 tanks, as if tank battles are the wave of thefuture. Pennsylvania Republican Curt Weldon happily sold hisvote for more money for the V-22 Osprey, which the Pentagonhas tried to kill for three straight years.   Some Members go especially cheap. Richard Ray, a GeorgiaDemocrat, backed Mr. Aspin after he squeezed projects worth$4.2 million for Robins Air Force Base in his district.Virginia Democrat Norman Sisisky went along with the chairmanafter Fort Lee, in his Virginia district, lined up for $11.3million for a finance office and training facility thePentagon didn't want. &quot;I could give you hundreds of theseexamples,&quot; says one Pentagon source.   Some log-rolling is inevitable, but a fast-decliningdefense budget has a smaller margin for waste. DefenseSecretary Cheney's budget already proposes to shrink themilitary by 25% through 1995, to the lowest level as a shareof the economy since 1939. Anything less and the U.S. mightnot be able to repeat Desert Storm, which apparently doesn'tworry the pork-barrel generals of Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
