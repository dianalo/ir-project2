Gets Broad Patent On Factor VIII Drug for Hemophiliacs </HL><AUTHOR> David Stipp (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GENI ROR </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Genetics Institute Inc. won a broad U.S. patent on an experimental drug for hemophiliacs that promises to become a major biotechnology product during the next few years.    The biotechnology concern said the patent covers genetically engineered Factor VIII, a blood-clotting agent that is mostly missing from hemophiliacs' blood. The patent also covers genetic material, cells and a genetic-engineering process used in making Factor VIII, the company said.    Genetics Institute has licensed its version of the drug to Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter International Inc., which began clinical trials with it in March 1987.    The patent apparently gives Genetics Institute a major advantage over competitors in the race to bring genetically engineered Factor VIII to market. Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, is considered Genetics Institute's closest rival in developing genetically engineered Factor VIII. A spokesman for Genentech noted that it has a patent application pending.    A potential conflict may exist, however, between Genetics Institute's patent and another one issued earlier to Rorer Group Inc., Fort Washington, Pa., on Factor VIII. Rorer's patent, which covers purified Factor VIII derived from human blood, was issued in a narrow version in 1982 and broadened in 1985, said Robert Kupor, an analyst with Seattle-based Cable, Howse andamp; Ragen. But Genetics Institute applied for its patent on genetically engineered Factor VIII before Rorer's patent was broadened, which may give Genetics Institute an advantage in a patent dispute between the companies, he added.    In any case, the potentially conflicting claims on Factor VIII may be resolved by a cross-licensing agreement between the companies involved, analysts said.    Hemophiliacs now use Factor VIII derived from human blood. But fears of blood contamination by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus caused world-wide sales of Factor VIII to fall to about $200 million in 1987 from $250 million a year earlier, Mr. Kupor said. A genetically engineered version of the drug could quickly grab a significant share of the market, he added.    Genetics Institute's version of Factor VIII is expected to get Food and Drug Administration approval and reach the market by early 1990. While analysts estimate that the world-wide market for Factor VIII will be more than $300 million by the early 1990s, a genetically engineered version of the drug might significantly expand the market for Factor VIII. If hemophiliacs use it as a preventive drug that is continually injected, rather than as a drug to stop occasional bleeding, the market for Factor VIII could grow to more than $1 billion, according to some estimates.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genetics Institute closed at $18, unchanged. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Baxter closed at $19.75, down 12.5 cents; Genentech fell 87.5 cents to close at $24.625; and Rorer closed at $35.50, down 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
