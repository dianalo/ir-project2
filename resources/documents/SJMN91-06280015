As I disembark at JanSmuts Airport in Johannesburg, a host of black laborers toil furiously amongstthe busy construction project adjacent to customs. Above the blacks, two orthree white supervisors, at least one of them barely more than a teen-ager,stand gazing into space. That hierarchical relationship was an article offaith in the John Vorster and P.W. Botha regimes that preceded President F.W.de Klerk, both in and outside of employment, and remains much more than avestigial remnant of apartheid.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AMID ASTONISHING CHANGE, S. AFRICA FUTURE ISTROUBLING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  William B. Gould IV, a professor of law at Stanford University, recently madehis fourth visit to South Africa. He wrote this article for Perspective.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The 'new' South Africa; But there are profound changes sweeping the &quot;new&quot;South Africa, the buzzword used by both blacks and whites to describe thecurrent transition, and they are far more dramatic than the continuity stillin place. In the first place, there are black supervisors who haveresponsibility for all races -- I saw one of them at the East London MercedesBenz plant -- but it is still a relatively rare occurrence. The de Klerkgovernment has eliminated job reservation, through which higher echelon jobswere lawfully the exclusive preserve of whites, thus promoting the blackadvance into skilled positions, a phenomenon that had commended in advance ofstatutory repeal.;   Gone are the &quot;whites only&quot; signs that one found on buses,taxis, bathrooms and restaurants, though sometimes corporate facilities thatwere previously reserved for whites only are now set aside for salariedemployees, thus providing for the practical equivalent of racial segregation.;  One cannot travel the roads of any part of South Africa without observingthe numerous black operated and driven taxis or vans that ferry blacks in andout of the townships, the major example of black enterprise -- and,regrettably, the major road hazard because of their willingness to top in themiddle of busy thoroughfares to pick up or discharge passengers. They are farmore successful than the swelling band of black hawkers that now appear on allcity streets. There were fewer hawkers in the '70s and no black taxis at all.;  In 1991 one observes far more social contact between the races. In the '70s,if a black and white were in a car together, one assumed that they wereplainsclothed police. Indeed, interracial couples, once the object of thelaw's scrutiny and hostility, are seen in all of the major cities.;   Farswifter than the change in employment is the shifting racial composition ofthe &quot;white&quot; universities. Due to affirmative action in student recruitment --a concept still embryonic and widely resisted in both the South Africancorporate world and in the universities' own employment practices --universities that had a few token blacks enrolled through special governmentalpermission procedures a decade ago are now truly multi-racial. For example,some of the departments at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand areapproximately 30 percent black.;   There are other developments of equalsignificance. The black labor movement, harassed and without state legalprotection, had a mere 60,000 workers affiliated with it in the late '70s. Nowit boasts nearly 2 million members, most of them part of the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions (COSATU), which has a tripartite alliance with both theAfrican National Congress and the South African Communist Party.;   No shiftin South Africa is more stunning than the fresh winds of free speech anddiscussion in a country where bannings, security prosecutions and detentionswithout trial were once the order of the day. Now, even the government's SouthAfrican Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) airs programs that are contentious andpose challenges to governmental policy. New radio stations, such as theirreverent &quot;702,&quot; vigorously investigate and air a wide range of views throughtalk shows.;   Of course, the most astonishing aspect of all of this is theend of the ban of the African National Congress, which languished in relativeobscurity in the '70s, a memory of the middle aged and elderly. The upheavalsof the '80s and the swelling of young black activists turned the newgeneration to the ANC and its armed wing, Umkonto we Sizwe. In early July ofthis year, the ANC conference (the first one held inside South Africa in 30years) featured the once imprisoned and exiled, whose words of excoriationcould not be printed or uttered before last year.;   But there is another sideto the new South Africa, a more ominous and troublesome development. Themovement of desperate rural black dwellers into urban areas and even smallaffluent towns in the southern Cape, has produced the most primitive andsqualid camps along all major roads. There are now estimated to be more than 7million black squatters, more than the entire white population of SouthAfrica. The repeal of &quot;influx control&quot; and pass legislation means that theimpoverished have nothing to lose through movement.;   Soaring crime rate; Thegovernment's recent decision to release thousands of common criminals has bothsent the crime rate soaring upward and exacerbated black township tensions --tensions that have again erupted in violence, shootings, hackings andstabbings. For those without means of support, crime is now a way of life.;  A related concern is the random killing of black people in the townships byseemingly professional hit men whose prime objective appears to be the erosionof the peace accord signed Sept. 14 by the government, the ANC and ChiefMangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-dominated, Inkatha-led party. Some of thisviolence seems to have been triggered by bad feeling between the Inkatha-ledmigrants who occupy single sex hostels and township residents who have had arelatively stable family life.;   The theme that cuts through any discussionof crime is economics. The sobering reality is that South Africa can nowemploy only about one tenth of the blacks coming into the labor market everyyear. This means that growth and investment (most of it necessarily foreign)will be vital. And that means that a political accommodation between black andwhite in the form of constitutional negotiations that may begin this year -- amere distant dream of the '70s --) must be found soon.
