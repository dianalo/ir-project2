Jesse Jackson, not the nomination of Gov. Michael Dukakis, threatening to dominate the week's proceedings.    The negotiations between the two camps have involved not only the politics of the convention but also have spilled over into how much representation Jackson forces would have on the Democratic National Committee, in a presidential transition and in the new administration if Mr. Dukakis prevails in the fall election.    &quot;We want to be involved at all levels,&quot; said Ronald Brown, Mr. Jackson's convention chairman.    The Jackson forces have suggested that their candidate be designated an administration &quot;crisis negotiator&quot; to step into foreign-policy emergencies. Mr. Jackson once even advanced the term &quot;co-presidency&quot; but quickly dropped it, according to a prominent Democrat and former high officeholder. However, the Jackson forces have drawn comparisons with the roles that Washington lawyers Robert Strauss and Sol Linowitz have played in previous administrations.    The Dukakis dilemma is to make enough concessions to win the convention peace that will permit the party to present a unified image to television viewers without appearing weak and permitting critics to charge that a Dukakis administration would be hostage to Mr. Jackson's demands.    &quot;You can't have two quarterbacks,&quot; the Massachusetts governor said before leaving Boston for Atlanta. &quot;Every team has to have a quarterback. That's the nominee.&quot;    The two men, who spoke by telephone yesterday, are scheduled to meet over breakfast here today, perhaps to move the dispute to a conclusion.    Mr. Jackson, who has made it clear that he doesn't desire a cabinet post, is using as leverage the threat that he might challenge the vice-presidential nomination of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas on the convention floor. On the CBS News program &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; Mr. Jackson said yesterday that previous vice-presidential floor fights &quot;didn't destroy the party&quot; and were &quot;within the best tradition&quot; of the party.    The vice-presidential challenge is unlikely, but the Jackson forces are expected to fight for some platform planks on the floor tomorrow, including proposals to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and to freeze military spending -- both opposed by the Dukakis camp. The Jackson forces also are expected to bring to the floor a minority plank calling for increased funding for anti-poverty and child-care programs, which the Dukakis forces may find palatable.    Mr. Jackson warned his supporters against responding angrily, as some have threatened to do, if they feel he is mistreated by Gov. Dukakis and the party leadership. &quot;This is a one-day-at-a-time, indeed, a one-hour-at-a-time, indeed, one-big-decision-at-a-time proposition. You are now in the big leagues of politics,&quot; he told labor delegates. &quot;Don't come up in here with amateurish reaction to professional judgments.&quot;    Both sides say progress is being made in the negotiations. The discussion of platform planks, which is considered separate from the larger issue of the general role the Jackson forces will have after the Atlanta convention, remains suspended until the relationship between the two camps &quot;is better defined,&quot; Mr. Brown said.    The Dukakis camp is holding out hope that the disputes will be resolved swiftly. &quot;I think the people we're talking to are very reasonable,&quot; said Paul Brountas, the Dukakis campaign chairman.    But the Dukakis forces are loathe to make any promises on the transition or the administration. They fear such concessions would constrict their mobility after the election and would invite Republican charges that they have pandered to Mr. Jackson and his supporters.    Before leaving for Atlanta, Mr. Dukakis signed a state budget of nearly $12 billion for the fiscal year that began July 1. The budget was held up as Mr. Dukakis and his aides labored to address an unexpected revenue shortfall that threatened his image as an efficient manager with frugal impulses.    As the governor struggled with the state fiscal crisis in Boston, negotiators from both camps were involved in marathon negotiations touching on what Mr. Brown said was the &quot;degree and level of involvement&quot; of the Jackson forces in the Dukakis campaign.    Mr. Jackson preceded Mr. Dukakis here by a full day, arriving late Saturday afternoon when his caravan of buses and cars completed its steamy journey from Chicago. At rallies and church meetings along the way, Mr. Jackson stressed his view that the &quot;progressive wing&quot; of the Democratic Party hasn't any influence and that the &quot;partnership&quot; between his supporters and those of Mr. Dukakis had yet to be defined.    The dispute flared over the vice-presidential issue. At their July 4th dinner, Mr. Dukakis specifically asked Mr. Jackson about the vice-presidential nomination and Mr. Jackson pointedly said he wanted it. Mr. Jackson learned of the selection of Mr. Bentsen from a reporter, not from Mr. Dukakis himself. Since then, Mr. Jackson has repeatedly indicated his dissatisfaction with the Dukakis camp and what he describes as its failure to find a role for him and his supporters while the Dukakis campaign has rushed to reassure their rivals. </TEXT></DOC>
