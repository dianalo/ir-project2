He appeared to refer to Iranians kidnapped by the LebaneseForces militia in north Lebanon in 1982, along with their Lebanesedriver, a Shiite Moslem. All four are believed dead.   Speaking to a news conference attended by mostly foreignreporters, Rafsanjani also ruled out any participation by U.S.corporations in Iran's post-war reconstruction.   ``I don't think American companies can play any role in Iran,''he said.   Sitting behind a small table in the high-ceilinged hall of thepresidential office in downtown Tehran, Rafsanjani spoke in a softvoice, smiling frequently as he played with a string of worrybeads. His remarks were translated by an interpreter.   ``If the conditions are right we might be able to do something''about the abducted Westerners, he said.   It was not the first time Iran has linked its help in releasingWestern hostages to the unfreezing of the assets or the release ofthe Iranians kidnapped seven years ago.   The hostages, who include eight Americans, are believed to beheld by pro-Iranian groups. Rafsanjani said hostage-taking is an``inhuman action'' that can produce no positive political results.   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid, ``Our position has not changed. We do not link the Iranianassets to the hostages and we do not make deals for hostages.''   As for Iran's influence over the hostages, Fitzwater said, ``Wehave always said we believe that they have an influence on thehostages, that they have considerable knowledge, but we can't gaugehow specific that is.''   He said the United States has provided Iran with all theinformation it has on Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon.   Responding to a question from an American reporter, Rafsanjanisaid he had proposed ``two methods'' that the United States coulduse to facilitate release of the hostages, adding:   ``The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release ourassets. This is something that you will have to do, and sooner orlater you will be forced to do it. So do it now.''   ``Secondly, if you do not want to give us our money, at leastyou can get your agents, your lackeys in Lebanon to release ourhostages. If you say they are not alive, at least you can give usback their bodies or show us their graves.''   The assets, estimated at more than $1 billion, have been frozensince students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979. Fifty-twoAmericans were held hostage there for 444 days.   The Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 are AhmadMotevaselian, commander of the contingent of Iranian RevolutionaryGuards based in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon; Iranian Charged'Affaires Hussein Musavi; and Kazem Akhavan, a correspondent forIRNA; along with Rastegar Moqadam, their driver.   All were kidnapped at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint 25 milesnorth of Beirut.   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea said in August 1988 thatafter he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of themissing men and blamed his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, for theirdisappearance and apparent murder.   Geagea's disclosure was the first formal comment by the LebaneseForces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missingIranians. All four men are believed dead.   Eighteen Westerners are held in Lebanon: eight Americans, fourBritons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.   The longest held is American journalist Terry A. Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
