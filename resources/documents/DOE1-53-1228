For this purpose, a method isdeveloped of a group expansion of the evolution operator of a many-particlesystem. It is shown that only irreducible pair collisions make a contributionto the high-frequency asymptotic behavior. As an illustration, calculationsare performed for interatomic potentials modeled by a power function.Application of the developed methods to the case of classical high-temperatureplasma leads to the well-known Ginzburg formula for the high frequencyconductivity.</TEXT></DOC>
