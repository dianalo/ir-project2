The new procedures will officially end the traditional written examination for such jobs. Director of the Office of Personnel Management, Constance Horner, said the new system, expected to be in place by next April, will permit the government to compete more effectively with the private sector for &quot;high quality&quot; college graduates seeking entry-level professional or administrative positions.    It will also permit the government to attract a more racially and ethnically diverse work force, she said. Ms. Horner described the civil-service plan yesterday at a gathering of federal recruiters here.    &quot;There is no doubt that we will get better people, which is what the merit system is supposed to do,&quot; she said.    The government hasn't had any entrance test for more than 100 types of jobs since 1982, when the Professional and Administrative Career Examination, known as PACE, was discarded as racially discriminatory after a lawsuit. Hiring since then has been based on what was to be a temporary process of interviews, recommendations and college grades. A federal judge here also threw out that process last year, calling it &quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; but the government has continued using it while appealing the case.    Ms. Horner said she has also become increasingly concerned that the federal government can't compete for applicants because testing procedures are so slow that the best-qualified accept other jobs. She also said the old exam, with its sole emphasis on cognitive skills, &quot;did not measure other qualities that common sense tells us are important to job performance, such as persistence, cooperation with others, ambition and drive.&quot;    Under the new system, college graduates attaining a grade-point average of 3.0 to 3.25 on a 4.0 scale will be eligible for consideration. Ms. Horner said that such grades are a &quot;reasonably rigorous indicator of a candidate's competence,&quot; as well as a measure of hard work and motivation. She said direct college recruiting will also allow interviewers to assess the less tangible aspects of &quot;human character.&quot;    For candidates who haven't attended college, lack a high grade-point average, or are applying for specialized jobs, the government will offer a series of job-related exams in combination with a new test designed to offer clues to such character attributes as self-discipline and leadership ability. Ms. Horner said the so-called Individual Achievement Record is widely used in the private sector and its results show fewer race-based discrepancies than the old PACE exam.    The proposal must still be reviewed by the courts. Congressional overseers of the civil service planned to review it, aides to the House civil service subcommittee said. </TEXT></DOC>
