The appeal, which was set to be argued in the high court next month, was dismissed at the request of Solicitor General Charles Fried. On Tuesday, he had dropped his constitutional challenge to giving such authority to the comptroller general, who answers to the legislature. In a letter to the high court, Mr. Fried said a recent congressional amendment made the dispute &quot;no longer of sufficient importance&quot; to merit decision.    The case involves a 1984 law intended by Congress to promote competition for federal contracts, including defense contracts. Under the law, an unsuccessful bidder for a contract has the right to protest, and the comptroller general may delay the contract award for 90 days while investigating.    The law also allowed the comptroller general to extend the delay beyond 90 days if he gave written reasons. But Congress, in a defense appropriations bill President Reagan signed Oct. 1, limited the comptroller general's authority to hold up contracts to 90 days. In his letter, Mr. Fried said the amendment would &quot;lessen the degree to which the comptroller general is permitted to interfere with executive branch functions.&quot;    The case arose in a protest by Ameron Inc., which was the low bidder on a contract for sewer repairs at the West Point military academy. The contract was awarded to another bidder and Ameron went to court. Along the way, the Justice Department challenged the constitutionality of the law, but a federal appeals court in Philadelphia upheld it in May 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
