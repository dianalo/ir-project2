By itself, Texas is still the seventh largest producer in theworld, but its oil, real estate and banking industries have beendevastated since a 1986 oil price collapse.   Texans ``cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and hopeeverything is going to be OK,'' says Kent Hance, one of the threemembers of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oilproduction in the state.   Hance met earlier this month with Rilwanu Lukman, the presidentof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and discussedthe possibility that his state and the cartel would cooperate. Morecontacts are planned.   Hance told Harte-Hanks newspapers on Tuesday that cutting Texasproduction to hold up prices ``is one of the things that has to beconsidered. It would be one of the items we would discuss'' atOPEC's April 23 meeting in Vienna.   ``We can do it to prevent waste,'' he said in an interviewThursday from Austin.   From the 1930s to the early 1970s, Texas played the role thatSaudi Arabia can play today _ acting as the world's swing producer,whose production stabilizes the price of oil. The commission, bycontrolling the amount of Texas oil produced, thus had asignificant degree of control over prices.   That influence dissipated with the rise of the OPEC cartel andsince 1972, the Texas commission has allowed wells in the state toproduce at 100 percent of capacity.   OPEC demonstrated its clout in 1973, when 11 Arab membernations, angered over the Arab-Israeli conflict, slapped the UnitedStates with an oil embargo that produced gasoline lines all overthe country.   Hance said that in the discussions with OPEC, ``we are nottrying to seek an alliance or cartel. We just want input. ... Ourgoal is one of stability.''   But OPEC head Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, told AP-DowJones in Vienna last week after meeting with Hance in London,``Exchanging information isn't going to do the trick, is it?''   Last week, Hance said he had discussed a more effective outputmonitoring system for OPEC, which has been plagued for severalyears by member cheating.   That point struck John Lamont, oil specialist in the Washingtonlaw firm of Lobel, Novins, Lamont andamp; Flug.   Noting that the commission for four decades had effectivecontrol over oil prices, Lamont said, ``I don't want Texas goingover there and showing them how it's done.''   Lamont said cooperation with the cartel by the commission wouldbe ``probably illegal'' under antitrust laws, but that was disputedby William Baxter, a former head of the Justice Department'santitrust division who is now a professor at Stanford UniversityLaw School.   The economic harm resulting from higher prices and reducedoutput ``is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are aimedagainst,'' said Baxter, but he added that it is ``fairly standarddoctrine'' that the laws apply only to private action, not actionby states.   States also can file antitrust suits, and eight did so recentlyagainst insurance companies. One of the attorneys general involved,Robert Abrams of New York, was asked about the chances of a suitagainst Texas should it cut production in concert with OPEC.   His spokeswoman, Nancy Connell, replied, ``OPEC price-fixing hascost U.S. consumers billions, maybe trillions of dollars, and wewouldn't want to see a state of the United States participating.''But she said Abrams' office ``would want to know more about Texaslaw'' before commenting on any legal challenges.   Mark Sheehan, spokesman for the Justice Department antitrustdivision, declined to comment.   But a State Department official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said: ``You can imagine what the Reagan administrationthinks about it. It's a cartel that does not operate in U.S.interests.''   On the record, Doug Elmets, press aide to Energy Secretary JohnHerrington, said, ``It's the department's belief and thegovernment's policy that assistance to OPEC in its effort tomanipulate the price of oil is not the correct approach.''   Texas had 201,000 oil wells, a third of the national total, atthe end of 1986 _ down 8,000 wells from the year before. Thestate's 2.3 million barrels a day in 1986, the most recent year forwhich state-by-state statistics are available, was more than aquarter of U.S. crude production totaling 8.6 million barrels.   Current U.S. production is about 8.2 million barrels, and mostanalysts believe Texas' production is more than 2 million barrels.   Several analysts pooh-poohed Texas' chances of achievinganything by talking with OPEC.   ``It's a joke,'' said Ed Rothschild, assistant director of theCitizen-Labor Energy Coalition, a group which advocates``pro-consumer'' positions. He noted that OPEC has had troublecontrolling prices in recent years.   ``Since 1981, this organization has been a crumbling,disorganized, battling group of countries,'' he said. ``When theyagree on action, it never works out. Within a month it's back tonormal _ price discounting.''   Arnold Safer, president of Energy Futures Group Inc., aWashington consulting firm, said a plausible Texas production cutto help OPEC might be 70,000 barrels a day. But he said another70,000 barrels a day ``would show up pretty quick on world oilmarkets, I guarantee it'' _ perhaps even provided by other U.S.producing states.</TEXT></DOC>
