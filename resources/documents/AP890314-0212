Meanwhile, the national Air Line Pilots Association threw a crimpinto any Eastern effort to sell aircraft or routes by refusing tofly them for different carriers unless strike-supporting Easternpilots are hired for the work.   In Atlanta, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused toorder Eastern pilots to return to work, but set a hearing on March23 before a three-judge panel to hear full arguments on theairline's appeal in Tallahassee, Fla.   And in a labor rally at dusk in Miami, Mary Jane Barry, presidentof the Transport Workers Union local representing flight attendants,told a crowd of 750 that an anti-Continental campaign would belaunched Thursday in Denver, one of the carrier's hubs. She wouldnot elaborate.   Eastern launched 94 flights Monday and expected the same numberTuesday and Wednesday. The airline had been projecting up to 140flights per day by now, but spokesman Jim Ashlock said, ``We're justdoing what we're doing.''   ``We don't even think it was that many,'' said pilots associationspokesman J.B. Stokes. ``I think they're being generous tothemselves.''   The airline had run more than 1,000 flights daily before thestrike by its machinists in a contract dispute over wage concessions.   The Eastern ticket plan submitted and approved Tuesday under theairline's Chapter 11 financial reorganization filing in U.S.Bankruptcy Court in New York offered a first-class upgrade foranyone with Eastern tickets and reservations on routes still beingflown.   Consumers also could hold their tickets until Eastern resumesflights and get a half-price fare for a companion or obtain couponsfrom other airlines, hotels, rental car companies good for thepurchase of their services at discounted prices.   Sister-carrier Continental Airlines will continue to honorEastern tickets, and ``Eastern continues to work with other airlinesto help establish policies for acceptance of Eastern tickets,'' thecompany said in a news release.   Eastern also is seeking permission to pay commissions to travelagents for the fourth quarter of 1988 _ money that was tied up alongwith salaries when the nation's seventh-largest carrier filed forbankruptcy protection Thursday.   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., expected a vote on the House floorWednesday on his legislation that would require President Bush tointervene by appointing an emergency panel, as recommended by theNational Mediation Board after 17 months of fruitless talks betweenEastern and the Machinists.   The measure by Oberstar, chairman of the aviation subcommittee ofthe House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would orderEastern employees back to work at pre-strike salaries and requirethe panel to recommend a settlement in 21 days, with the presidenthaving the discretion to add five days.   But the legislation, even if passed, isn't given much chance ofsurviving a presidential veto, and its standing in Bankruptcy Courtis uncertain.   ``If the government asks us to go back under the imposed rules,we'll do that,'' Machinists leader Wally Haber said, referring towage cuts imposed by Eastern after the strike began. ``We have tostart generating new revenue, and we'll only generate revenue whenwe get back to work.''   Machinists charged that the new wage scales imposed by Easternwhen the strike began are now the lowest in the airline industry.   Eastern did not address the statement directly, but spokesmanAshlock said: ``Our work rules are also predicated on what we lookon as industry standards. The union wants to look at comparisonsbetween airlines. We have to look at the overall marketplace andsay, `For this particular job what are qualified people willing totake this job for?'''   The pilots' union is trying to protect its 3,600 Eastern membersby requiring other carriers who buy Eastern assets to hire Easternpilots and preserve their seniority. The ALPA also announced a $9million package of strike benefits ranging from $2,400 a month instrike benefits to interest-free loans to cover withheld paychecks.   In bankruptcy court the ALPA asked to transfer Eastern managementfrom its parent Texas Air Corp. to a trustee, accusing Texas AirChairman Frank Lorenzo of stripping Eastern's assets. And the8,500-member Machinists union asked for $8 million in paychecks duelast Friday and $1 million in insurance premiums due for Februarycoverage.   Also Tuesday:   _The Communications Workers of America board approved a $100,000contribution to support Eastern strikers. The union also urged its700,000 members to donate $2 a month through local unions for thestrikers.   _The American Association of Travel Agents urged TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner to set up a plan for refunds to Easternticket holders and said he should order other airlines to accept thetickets.   _U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan refused to let theEastern strike spread to a Philadelphia-area commuter railroad thatcarries 90,000 passengers a day.   _Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis threw his support to strikersat a rally in Boston Tuesday night by 1,000 Eastern machinists andsympathizers. ``You've got a governor who's a union member and proudof it,'' said Dukakis.   Also attending the rally were National Organization for WomenPresident Molly Yard, Mayor Raymond Flynn and Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy.</TEXT></DOC>
