Answering questions during a visit to a U.S. air base in easternEngland, Cheney said it was necessary to maintain the COCOM regime_ the organization of industrial democracies that regulates tradein items to Soviet bloc nations. COCOM stands for CoordinatingCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls.   Cheney arrived here Wednesday from a NATO meeting in Portugaland had talks with British Defense Secretary Tom King. His nextstop was West Germany.   The export committee's 17 member states _ the United States, 14of its NATO allies, Australia and Japan _ are meeting at a secretvenue in Paris.   Cheney welcomed the changes in the Soviet Union and EasternEurope but said the West needs to remain ``very cautious about thekinds of technology we allow to be transferred to the easternbloc.''   He said the Soviet Union still has ``a huge arsenal ofintercontinental ballistic weapons and other strategic systems''targeted against the United States and other NATO members.   ``They are the only nation in the world capable of destroyingus. I think it is in our interests, under those circumstances, tocontinue the COCOM regime,'' Cheney said.   The United States' COCOM allies are pressing for an easing oftrade restrictions, leaving Washington all but isolated, accordingto a U.S. source who spoke on condition of anonymity before themeeting began Wednesday.   European members accuse the United States of failing to adapt tothe changes in the East bloc and of using COCOM to protect U.S.manufacturers from foreign competition.   At the NATO meeting in Portugal, Cheney expressed concern abouta Kremlin push to upgrade its strategic, or long-range, nuclearweapons.   ``The Soviet Union still possesses enormous militarycapability,'' he said. ``The Soviets continue with an aggressivemodernization program of their own strategic (nuclear) systems.''   He said their ``strategic capability is more robust today thanit was when Mr. Gorbachev came to power.''   In their final statement, Cheney and the other NATO officialscalled on the Soviet Union to make unilateral cuts in itsshort-range nuclear missile systems to current NATO levels.   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450short-range nuclear missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lancelaunchers, most based in West Germany.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to pull out500 short-range nuclear weapons from Europe this year.</TEXT></DOC>
