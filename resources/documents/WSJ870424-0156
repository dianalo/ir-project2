In a proxy for its annual meeting to be held May 20, Texas Air asked shareholders to approve an amendment that would double the voting power of a special class of common shares owned by Jet Capital Corp., a holding company 50.7%-owned by Mr. Lorenzo. Texas Air said that after taking account of recent stock sales that diluted Jet Capital's voting power to 21% this year, the new amendment would increase Jet Capital's level of control to 34.1%. Jet Capital's voting power had been at 45% as recently as 1985.    Texas Air, which through acquisitions has become the nation's largest airline operator, said a committee of independent directors approved the amendment to help fend off unwanted takeover attempts and to ensure the stability of Texas Air's management.    &quot;Jet Capital will be in a better position to exert influence over corporate decisions and the company and its stockholders will be better protected against unfair takeover bids,&quot; the proxy stated. Texas Air also said that by strengthening Jet Capital's voting power it can ensure that &quot;management is able to continue its focus on long-term objectives without being distracted by short-term speculation in the company's securities.&quot;    As previously reported, Jet Capital recently hired a new president for purposes that Texas Air declines to discuss. In the proxy statement, Texas Air said it has $17.3 million in cash invested in joint investments held by Jet Capital and Texas Air.    Jet Capital was formed as an investment vehicle by Mr. Lorenzo and a partner in the late 1960s. It later acquired control of Texas Air's predecessor, Texas International Airlines. The relationship between Jet Capital and Texas Air has been restructured several times in recent years, allowing Mr. Lorenzo to maintain his effective control of Texas Air through Jet Capital. Other Jet Capital shares are owned by officers and directors of Texas Air.    Texas Air shareholders are also being asked to approve a proposal to increase the number of authorized common shares to 200 million from 75 million, and to increase the number of authorized preferred shares to 50 million from 15 million. </TEXT></DOC>
