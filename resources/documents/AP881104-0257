(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Sen. James Sasser was heavilyfavored to win a third term Tuesday, but his popularity appearedunlikely to help Michael Dukakis deny the state's 11 electoral votesto Republican George Bush.   Sasser was opposed by Republican Bill Andersen, a law partner offormer White House chief of staff and Sen. Howard Baker.   In the presidential race, a poll in early October, before thesecond debate, showed Bush and Dukakis running neck-and-neck. ButDemocratic Gov. Ned McWherter later publicly predicted what otherDemocrats said privately: Bush will be the eighth Republicanpresidential candidate to carry Tennessee in 10 elections.   Democrats now control the U.S. House delegation 6-3.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance</NOTE></DOC>
