The band is belting out fight songs, the cheerleaders are bouncing up and down the floor, and Coach Bud McCrea's complexion is deepening to a disturbing shade of purple.    Mr. McCrea, 50, leaps off the bench, finger jabbing, offering unsolicited advice to one of the referees. Ten seconds later he is up again, bellowing instructions to his players. His hair is mussed, his shirttail peeks out, and the powder-blue sports jacket on his back is a rumpled mess.    All this, mind you, with the Panora-Linden Hawkettes ahead by 18 points and pulling away. If the game were any closer, someone might have to call the paramedics.    Tonight's thumping of neighboring Stuart-Menlo High boosts the Hawkettes' record to 13-0. Panora has only 179 students, drawing on a town of only 1,200 population. But it has the No. 1-ranked girls basketball team in a state that turns out as many as 90,000 fans to watch the girls' playoffs during five days in March. &quot;I don't have losing seasons,&quot; Mr. McCrea says, without a trace of modesty. &quot;It's got to be the other guy who loses.&quot;    In the complex sociology of small-town life, coaches like Bud McCrea are very important people. If successful sports teams give small-towners a sense of community identity and pride they might otherwise lack, if they are the social cement that holds a place together, then the high school coach is by necessity a pivotal figure. Bud McCrea knows that, and knows what his responsibility is -- to win, win, win, lest that pride crumble.    And he has. When he came here four years ago Panora hadn't had a winning girls basketball team in a dozen seasons. It hasn't had a losing one since, piling up an overall record of 79-14. &quot;If Bud came up and asked for $10,000, this crowd would give it to him,&quot; says retired farmer Richard Smith, a regular at the Hawkettes games.    &quot;People now seem to live for basketball nights,&quot; says Rilla Mills, a cashier at Panora Oil whose daughter is on the team. Local admirers call the coach at night with play suggestions and press packages of steaks on him, telling him, &quot;Just keep those girls winning.&quot;    Even if Panora didn't care about winning, the coach would. He is a driven man. &quot;He wants to be the best,&quot; says his wife, Clarice, &quot;and he wants recognition for being the best.&quot; He eats compulsively and sleeps fitfully during basketball season. By his own estimate some 85% of his time between games is spent thinking about basketball. &quot;I have a terrible fear of losing,&quot; Coach McCrea admits. &quot;When I lose, I feel like I've let everybody down.&quot;    There are a lot of similarities between his story and the 1986 film &quot;Hoosiers,&quot; in which actor Gene Hackman played a rumpled, hard-driving basketball coach who turns up at mythical Hickory High in a small Indiana town. There are shadows in his past and he meets some initial opposition, but he becomes a hero by taking the tiny school's team all the way to the state championship.    When Mr. McCrea arrived here to take over as the high school principal and girls basketball coach, there was murmuring about his two divorces and his reputation as a harsh disciplinarian. But he also brought with him a record of turning around losing basketball programs at several other Iowa schools.    He chose Panora, Mr. McCrea says, because it was small enough to let him hold both the administrative and coaching jobs at once and because the school presented a challenge. &quot;There were drug and alcohol problems with the students,&quot; he says, and the girls team had been a perennial loser.    Mr. McCrea immediately cracked down on drugs, drinking and smoking on school property. Students were told they couldn't even wear T-shirts with beer company logos to class. And the Hawkettes? &quot;I told the school board those kids were mine, 24 hours a day, 12 months a year,&quot; says the coach.    Since then Mr. McCrea has bounced an all-state candidate off the team for a year for missing his summer basketball camp. On the first fall day of practice he always warns his girls that getting involved with &quot;the wrong kind&quot; of boyfriends will interfere with their basketball play. He is not soft-spoken. &quot;Coach McCrea is fair,&quot; says Hawkette forward Lisa Hesseltine. &quot;He yells at everybody.&quot;    School officials say discipline problems have declined and academic scores have climbed since Mr. McCrea took over. The Hawkettes' record after his first two years inspired the Des Moines Register to pronounce him the top women's basketball coach in the state.    In the game against Stuart-Menlo, Mr. McCrea's rigorous drilling shows as the Hawkettes methodically take apart their opponents, finishing with a 67-43 win. The gym, which carries a vague scent of perfume over sweat, resounds with cheers of &quot;We're No. 1.&quot; Despite the one-sidedness of the game, Mr. McCrea remains tightrope-tense right to the final buzzer; some fans worry about the condition of his heart.    Told of this, the coach laughs. &quot;When I die,&quot; he says, &quot;I want to be out on the floor chewing on a ref. That way he'll feel bad and we'll get a break.&quot;    ---   Mr. Richards is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Chicago bureau.    (See related story: &quot;Teams Make Towns Winners...
