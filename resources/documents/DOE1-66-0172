<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0172 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experiments were conducted to study the performance of a heat pump systemusing ordinary cover-less, fin-tube flat plate type solar collectorswhich are solar collectors (radiation evaporators) characterized by badconvection heat transfer characteristics and by an ability to collectsolar energy at relatively high temperatures. Also, the performance ofa heat pump using two solar collectors (convection and radiator evaporators)in parallel was studied. The results are as follows: (1) The heat pumpusing radiation evaporators gives a high coefficient of performance (COP)when solar radiation is available; however, the COP reduction causedby reduced solar radiation is greater. (2) The evaporation temperaturecan be raised if both types of solar collector are used in parallel.If solar radiation is high, the heat pump using both types of solar collectoris likely to give a worse COP than the heat pump using radiation evaporatorsalone, however, this was not demonstrated in the experiments.
