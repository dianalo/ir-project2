Beginning next week, Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration inspectors will start ``walking through''high-hazard areas of every factory they enter instead of justlooking at plant office records of job illnesses and injuries, theagency said Tuesday.   The change will take effect Monday, a day before the Senatebegins hearings on a two-year congressional investigation into whatcritics maintain has been OSHA's excessive reliance on employerrecords in ferreting out job hazards.   ``Now when we go into a plant, the inspector is going to seewhat it looks like beyond the office,'' said Assistant LaborSecretary John A. Pendergrass, who ordered the new policy. ``Ourcompliance officers will see the conditions as they exist in thework areas.''   Pendergrass and other OSHA officials denied that the hearings,ordered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the SenateLabor and Human Resources Committee, were the impetus behind thenew policy.   ``We've been discussing a change like this for two years, andit's just now coming to fruition,'' said Frank White, the agency'sdeputy administrator.   In 1982 _ a year after Reagan took office _ OSHA began exemptingplants in high-hazard industries from inspections if their logsshowed injury rates that were below the nationwide average formanufacturing.   Ever since, unions and officials in some other federal agencieshave complained that the exemptions encouraged employers tounder-report injuries and illnesses in OSHA-required ``lost workday'' reports in order to avoid more comprehensive plantinspections.   Their case was bolstered by the death of a worker from cyanidepoisoning at a film processing plant in Chicago in 1983, just sixmonths after OSHA had pronounced the company in compliance withregulations based on an examination of its injury and illness logs.   A later inspection of the plant itself showed widespread healthand safety hazards in violation of the law, resulting in arecommendation for criminal prosecution of some of the company'sofficials.   ``That case has been in everybody's mind,'' Pendergrass saidTuesday. ``It's something we don't want to happen again.''   He said the walk-through examinations in addition to thedocument inspections at some 2,000 plants each year will give theagency ``better confidence on what the conditions are on the shopfloor.''   OSHA officials tried to downplay the significance of the change,describing it as a logical next step in a crackdown on job safetyviolators that began two years ago when William E. Brock becamelabor secretary.   Soon after taking office, Brock ordered a 10-fold increase inthe fines levied for OSHA violations, including those classified as``willful'' discrepancies in employer records. Brock said thehigher fines would act as a deterrent, keeping more companieshonest.   Instead of levying fines in the thousands of dollars, OSHA beganseeking penalties in the hundreds of thousands and, in a few cases,millions of dollars. It also began treating each instance of analleged violation as a separate charge, instead of lumping themtogether.   Margaret Seminario, assistant director of the AFL-CIO'soccupational health and safety division, said Tuesday that theagency began losing ``the Reagan ideology'' two years ago.   ``But until this, they really hadn't put in anything else,'' shesaid of the inspection order.   OSHA officials disagreed, saying they have done a lot more inthe past two years in reducing their dependence solely on employerrecords.   For example, they said, the agency two years ago began expandingthe records checks to include some random inspections of jobfloors. Inspectors two years ago also were required to startvalidating employer injury and illness reports by comparing themwith other records such as first aid logs and workers' compensationclaims.</TEXT></DOC>
