Depth, coal seam thickness and dip angles, dimensionsof a coal block being mined, stratification of coal bearing strata, etc.are evaluated. A mathematical model that describes ground subsidenceand formation of a subsidence trough is presented. Using the model forforecasting ground subsidence is analyzed. Forecasting accuracy is discussedon the example of 5 black coal mines in Upper Silesia (coal seams withdip angles from 12 to 36 degrees). 21 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
