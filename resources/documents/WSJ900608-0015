But Tiger is proving tough to tame.   Tiger, a landmark project in demography, is a minutelydetailed computerized map of the entire U.S. When combinedwith a data base such as the results of the 1990 census or acompany's own customer files, Tiger gives desktop computerusers for the first time the cartographic equivalent of thecomputerized spread sheet.</LP><TEXT>   Software companies, some run by Census Bureau veterans,are writing Tiger-based programs that allow small companiesto create &quot;smart maps&quot; on their own computers. Users can askvarious &quot;what if . . .&quot; questions and print out the answersin map form. Only mainframe computer customers could performthis trick before, and never with the geographic precisionprovided by Tiger.   Retailers, banks, franchisers, vehicle fleet operators,marketers, and direct mail houses are excited about thecombined Tiger-census file. So are political consultants andspecial interest groups, who see it as a revolutionary way toapproach political redistricting.   Package delivery companies can use Tiger technology tofigure out the fastest and most efficient routes for theirtruck fleets. By juggling population, age and income figureswith geography, retailers can pinpoint on a computer-screenmap the best location for a new store.   The Census Bureau's computer map is &quot;an amazing product .. . that has immediate uses,&quot; says Stephen Poizner, presidentof Strategic Mapping Inc., San Jose, Calif. His company's newprogram for PCs, Atlas*Gis, incorporates Tiger.   But training users in Tiger talk may be more difficultthan originally thought. The Census Bureau provides Tigerfiles on magnetic tapes for mainframes and on compact discs(CD-ROM) for PCs at bargain prices -- $250 for a disc thatmaps an entire state -- but the data is tough for thenon-computer professional to digest.   Viewed by itself, Tiger resembles uncooked spaghetti, ajumble of random lines and address numbers. &quot;Tiger is 16billion lines,&quot; says Ed Spar, president of New York-basedMarket Statistics. &quot;Until you turn those things intocoordinates, and blend them with a mapping software package,you haven't got much.&quot;   Some purchasers of the first Tiger tapes say they've foundan uncomfortable level of errors in the geographicinformation, including erroneous addresses and missing postalZIP code numbers.   The Tiger tapes &quot;are significantly different from what waspromised,&quot; grumbles Skip Hunt, general manager of DonnelleyMarketing Information Services, Stamford, Conn. JeanneSavage, a manager in the geographic information systemsdivision of International Business Machines Corp., says Tigertapes that IBM has seen vary from &quot;very accurate&quot; to &quot;OK.&quot;   Census enumerators are using Tiger maps in checkinghouseholds that didn't send in census forms and are pencilingin corrections. &quot;No map is completely up to date,&quot; saysRobert LaMacchia, a Census Bureau assistant division chieffor planning. &quot;Through use, the {Tiger} data will becomecurrent and represent what's actually on the ground.&quot;   &quot;There's going to be a whole industry that's going to takeTiger, improve it, and resell it at a premium,&quot; addsDonnelley's Mr. Hunt. Mr. Poizner says he expects &quot;a ton ofcompetitors,&quot; as the concept of desktop mapping becomesbetter known.   Tiger's formal name is the Topologically IntegratedGeographic Encoding and Reference file. It's an ambitious,seven-year, $200 million project that lists in digital formevery highway, street, bridge and tunnel in the 50 states.Each city block or stretch of country road carries its ownrange of addresses. In scope and level of detail, Tiger andits associated computer programs stand alone in the desktopmapping arena.   Software companies are scrambling to take advantage ofthis statistical mother lode. &quot;It looks like the governmentopened up a big oil field,&quot; says Don Cooke, president ofGeographic Data Technology, Lyme, N.H., who helped compileTiger when he worked at the Census Bureau. Mr. Cooke says theDetroit-based data firm R.L. Polk is paying his company $3million &quot;to clean up Tiger and make it work for direct mail.&quot;   Mr. Cooke thinks there's also a payoff in programs thathelp delivery services get better productivity from theirvehicles. &quot;Everybody running a big truck fleet is looking atthis technology,&quot; he says.   Routing Technology Software Inc., Vienna, Va., marketssoftware called Roadshow. It ponders the number and locationof orders received by a company, then divides the day'sdeliveries between vans, laying out the sequence of stops andthe most efficient route to drive. Tiger, &quot;in its presentform, is probably too tough to use so there's an opportunityfor companies like ours to predigest it,&quot; says Donald Soults,Routing Technology's president.   Even the watered-down version can be intimidating. &quot;Ican't even explain it to you, and I've seen it three times,&quot;says Richard Orloff, marketing manager for the Asbury ParkPress, an afternoon newspaper in central New Jersey. Thenewspaper uses Roadshow to deploy its circulation trucks.   Fred Barber, research demographer in the Washingtonconsulting firm Matthew Greenwald andamp; Associates, warns thatTiger is untested in the marketplace and complex for theaverage PC user. &quot;Small businesses, retailers anddistributors who can get on top of this are going to have acompetitive advantage. But I think the learning curve isgoing to be a bit steep.&quot;   Computer hardware may be a problem. Tiger programs requiremore computer capacity than some small businesses possess.And the price of software that can be linked to Tiger couldcome as a shock to the entrepreneur who is used to paying$400 for a sophisticated spread sheet. &quot;You're talking about$2,500 for a piece of software that doesn't even includeTiger data,&quot; says Joe Francica, commercial applicationsmanager for Tydac Technologies Corp. of Ottawa.   But Strategic Mapping's Mr. Poizner says: &quot;I'm shocked ifanyone thinks price is an issue. If you're building a newstore, you're talking $1 million in real estate andconstruction costs.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
