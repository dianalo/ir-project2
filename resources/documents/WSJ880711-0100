(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Syracuse chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People agreed to drop plans for a suit against a mall after settling a racial dispute that began with the eviction of hundreds of black youths from the center last March.    In return for the NAACP officials' agreement to drop the threatened civil rights lawsuit, Shoppingtown Mall officials pledged to meet five goals intended to help prevent similar racial flare-ups, NAACP Chapter President Van Robinson said.    About 500 youths, who were taking advantage of a St. Patrick's Day free bus ride promotion, were evicted from the mall March 12 after a brawl and an incident in which a 16-year-old youth was charged with disorderly conduct. NAACP officials said security guards evicted only black youths.    During discussions about the fracas, NAACP officials also criticized the mall for its alleged poor treatment of black customers and a lack of black employees and minority-owned businesses.    Under the agreement reached Thursday, Shoppingtown will ensure at least 20% of its employees are black or other minorities, Mr. Robinson said. Mall officials also will post rules of conduct and meet with merchants to institute cultural awareness programs. In addition, the mall agreed to help more black-owned businesses get established there.    Mr. Robinson said the agreement does not represent an admission of any wrongdoing on Shoppingtown's part. </TEXT></DOC>
