The moderates, who have emerged as the overwhelming majority inthe 102-member movement, resolutely resisted throughout the four-daymeeting attempts by a group of radical countries to introduce ColdWar rhetoric into the proceedings.   However, some of the language in the summit's final declarationreflected compromise among moderates and hard-liners, who insistedon inclusion of references to ``the struggle against imperialism,colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism apartheid and all forms ofdomination.''   An effort by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine LiberationOrganization, to add a condemnation of ``Zionism'' to the documentwas thwarted by moderates after a heated debate. The referenceeventually was relegated to one of 30 political and economicresolutions.   Conference documents, drafts of which had earlier been preparedby the Yugoslav hosts with the aim of revitalizing the non-alignedmovement, dealt with topics ranging from Afghanistan and the MiddleEast to terrorism and drug trafficking.   One document ``resolutely demanded that all hostages and allkidnapped persons be immediately released ... irrespective of theperpetrators and the place of the crime.''   The document on ``international terrorism'' said the summitparticipants condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated byindividuals, states and groups of states.   The movement also said growing links existed between terrorists,rightist paramilitary groups and drugs smugglers.   Economic issues, particularly the need to alleviate the burden ofthe $1.32 trillion foreign debt of Third World countries, receivedunprecedented attention at the summit.   The meeting adopted a package of resolutions calling for thecancellation of the debts for the least developed countries andlower interest rates to help the debtor countries revive theireconomic growth.   The summit brought together about 50 heads of state and a dozenpremiers, the largest number to attend since the non-alignedmovement was founded in 1961.   The movement once prided itself on its opposition to thesuperpowers and on its efforts to secure international peace, butsince the 1970s member nations have fought a series of bloody warsagainst each other.   However, attempts by the summit's Yugoslav hosts to tone downacrimonious debates between countries engaged in bitter conflicts,such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, proved largely unsuccessful.   U.N. Secretary General Peres de Cuellar also was successful inreviving stalled peace talks between Iran and Iraq, after the twocountries exchanged accusations over who was to blame forobstructing the negotiations.   Today's closing ceremony was marked by a sudden and impassionedappeal from the Lebanese delegate for all foreign forces to withdrawfrom that country.   A lighter touch was provided by Libyan leader Moammer Gadhafiwho, claiming he had come to ``save the movement,'' brought along asmall herd of camels and a full-sized bedouin tent that he pitchedin the yard of a guesthouse put at his disposal.   A last-minute attempt by Nicaragua to host the next summit in1992 foundered in the face of determined opposition from moderatenations that felt the country should be selected at a ministerialconference, to be held in Ghana in two years.</TEXT></DOC>
