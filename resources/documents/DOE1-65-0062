Thisheat storage element permits effective reduction of air in the heat storageelement, and therefore, heat is smoothly transferred from outside tothe latent heat storage material through the wall of the container. Accordingly,a heat storage element which has a very high heat storage element, havingalmost no air sealed in, has a large heat storage density. When thisheat storage element is used in combination with an electric heater element,heat will be uniformly transferred from the electric heater element tothe latent heat storage material, involving a very small risk of partof the electric heater element being overheated. 5 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
