Since the market for energyand heat together accounts for about 70% of end user energy, this iswhere the greatest potential lies of saving non-renewable resources.High-temperature processes for energy generation have considerable developmentpotential due to using combined gas-steam turbine processes and to raisingthe upper cycle temperature. In the case of coal fired power stationsthis requires the inclusion of coal gasification plant. For low temperatureprocesses, utilization of waste heat from power plant and industrialprocesses not only leads to conservation of fossil fuel reserves butalso protects the environment from the ill-effects of waste heat. Thestate of the art and future prospects are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
