These quotas, a so-called VoluntaryRestraint Agreement, are deserving of fame as America's mostharebrained trade barrier. In the name of preserving adomestic industry, the U.S. government has hurt some of themost progressive companies and given a windfall to some oftheir foreign competitors.   In May 1986, the U.S. announced plans to impose quotas onmachine tools from Japan and Taiwan. Machine tools areautomatic power-driven tools that are used to cut, drill andstamp the metal that becomes cars, airplanes, missiles, etc.Though the machine-tool industry employs roughly 70,000American workers, while industries relying on machine toolsemploy millions of workers, Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige promised listeners that the trade restrictions &quot;willcertainly increase employment.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Some American machine-tool makers are world-classcompetitors, but many have lagged far behind thetechnological breakthroughs of the past 15 years. The importquotas effectively created a quality bottleneck, holdingAmerican industry hostage to one lagging group of politicallyconnected companies. The Institute for InternationalEconomics estimated that the import quotas boosted theprofits of foreign machine-tool exporters by $320 million, bymaking machine tools more expensive than they otherwise wouldhave been.   In 1989, Caterpillar Inc. needed advanced Japanese machinetools to produce parts in the U.S. that it was then buying inJapan. But Caterpillar was stymied because that year's quotashad been allocated. It eventually persuaded Japan's Ministryof International Trade and Industry to reallocate part of thequota to Caterpillar's Japanese supplier.   Bill Lane of Caterpillar observes: &quot;The quotas let MITIdetermine which American companies would be winners andlosers. In our case it worked out OK -- but, as a result,some other American company faced delays in getting the typesof machine tools that it needed.&quot; One congressional staffersuggests other U.S. manufacturers may not have openlycriticized the quotas for fear of retaliation by U.S.machine-tool makers.   The quotas on Japan's producers were set at much higherlevels than on Taiwan's, and are currently not impedingJapanese exports. (Insiders suggest that Japanese officialswere much more savvy, using 1981 Japanese exports as abaseline -- a year in which a weak yen and surging U.S.demand resulted in very high exports.)   Many U.S. companies are concentrating on developingadvanced software and computer numerical controls to drivemachine tools, rather than on building the frames, which theyneed to import. The quotas have made it harder for U.S.companies to devote their resources to the area where theyhave a comparative advantage.   By disrupting the supply of Taiwanese low-priced, low-techinputs for high-tech U.S. machines, the quotas helpedbankrupt at least two American machine-tool makers -- BayerIndustries Inc. of Phoenix and MHP Machines Inc. of Buffalo,N.Y. And, by boosting the production costs of U.S.machine-tool makers, the quotas have undercut U.S. companies'efforts to maximize exports. Brian McLaughlin, chiefexecutive of Hurco Companies Inc. of Indianapolis, one ofAmerica's premier machine-tool exporters, estimates thequotas have cost his company $5 million a year.   Machine-tool import quotas control &quot;the building blocks ofindustry,&quot; as Secretary Baldrige observed in 1986. Yet, a1990 General Accounting Office report noted that Commerce&quot;does not have written policies or procedures for monitoringthe agreements and does not maintain complete records of themonitoring it does.&quot; U.S. businesses, desperately trying toget advanced equipment to enter the computer era ofmanufacturing, are at its mercy.   Commerce even has flouted U.S. trade law in its crusade toslash imports. In 1988, Taiwan began shipping somemachine-tool parts to Israel, where an Israeli companycombined the parts with Israeli products, built the finishedproduct, and exported it to the U.S. The Customs Serviceruled in 1988 that, since more than 35% of the value of thefinished product originated in Israel, the machine tools wereIsraeli products.   But Commerce designed its own 12-point test to determinemachine tools' national origin and then decreed that it wouldpenalize Taiwan for Israel's exports. Inside U.S. Trade, anewsletter, reported on Feb. 16, 1990: &quot;Commerce hasapparently decided to count the Israeli machine tools againstthe {Voluntary Restraint Agreement} retroactively from 1989.. . . As a result, Taiwan has stopped shipping themachine-tool parts to Israel, and the Israeli company thatmade the machine tools has gone out of business.&quot; A recentU.S.-Israeli panel concluded that Commerce's action violatedthe U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement, but the U.S. haseffectively refused to abide by the panel's decision.   Though the quotas were supposed to be a one-time dose ofprotection, the National Machine Tool Builders Association(ignoring dissent in its own ranks) and 120 representativesand senators are lobbying to extend the quota beyond its Dec.31 expiration date. The association warns: &quot;The machine-toolindustry is the belt that holds up the pants of America'sdefense capabilities. A slip of one notch could be enough tohave the United States find itself in a compromisingsituation.&quot; But the U.S. government cannot protect the toolbuilders without economically exposing all industries thatrely on machine tools.   Several leading machine-tool producers are urgingPresident Bush not to extend import quotas, in part becausethey believe the quotas make it harder for them to competewith Japanese companies in the U.S. market. Hurco's Mr.McLaughlin believes Japan's MITI is actively lobbying theWhite House to extend the quotas.   After years of staunchly pro-free-trade speeches emanatingfrom the White House speechwriters' offices, Americanbusinesses will learn whether it is once again safe to readGeorge Bush's lips.   ---   Mr. Bovard is the author of &quot;The Fair Trade Fraud&quot; (St.Martin's Press).</TEXT></DOC>
