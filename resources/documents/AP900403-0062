Water had to be trucked into one community where intake valveswere closed Monday because of the spill of up to 300,000 gallons ofdiesel, gasoline and kerosene that leaked after a landslide Fridayruptured a 10-inch-wide pipeline near Freeport, 35 miles north ofPittsburgh.   But water service to Pittsburgh residents continued normallytoday. The slick hugged the south bank of the river when it reacheddowntown Pittsburgh during the night and missed main water intakepipes operated by the Pittsburgh Water Authority, which servesabout 450,000 customers, authority spokeswoman Donna Sagmeistersaid.   A number of communities near Pittsburgh reopened their intakepipes as the fuel passed, but still asked customers to use watersparingly. Pittsburgh and suburban water authority officials todaysaid they were treating river water with increased amounts ofchemicals for safety.   ``We've been able to treat the spill as it has been passing usfor now,'' Ms. Sagmeister said today. ``There are still pockets ofoil floating, and if one of those pockets should park itself infront of our intake valves, we could be in trouble. But right nowit's moving slowly and in a fashion that we can treat it and notshut down.''   ``There's a slight sheen on the river right now, but a lot ofthe fuel has evaporated,'' Environmental Protection Agencyspokeswoman Carrie Deitzel said late Monday.   The spill had threatened the water supplies of up to 1 millionpeople.   At least 2,500 workers in the industrial valley were told tostay home Monday, although the Coast Guard by nightfall reopened a10-mile stretch of the river to barges and other vessels after atwo-day hiatus.   Later Monday, Harrison Township, the only suburban community tolose water service because of the accident, was able to resumepumping because petroleum concentrations had dropped. Townshipcustomers nevertheless should boil their water for drinking andcooking, the Allegheny County Health Department said.   The National Guard had sent 100 water trailers and a brewerytook bottled water to Harrison Township, where 20,000 people werewithout water Monday.   Factories, offices and about 400,000 people were advised toconserve water as the 20-mile spill, a mass 5 to 21 feet deep,oozed into Pittsburgh at half a mile an hour or less, forcingcommunities to shut their intakes one one by one.   Birds carried fuel to at least two nests, where eggs were coatedand ``can be considered dead,'' said Environmental ProtectionAgency spokeswoman Carrie Deitzel. Dead fish are expected to riseto the surface later, she said.   Daily Juice Products Inc. in Verona suspended production ofpasteurized juice. The plant uses 100,000 gallons of water a day,said plant manager Bob Rivett. Five tanker trucks delivered waterto make non-pasteurized drinks, he said.   Steelmaker Allegheny Ludlum Inc. trucked in water for thetoilets and other uses at its 2,600-employee plant in Brackenridge.PPG Industries Inc. halted production of automotive glass at itsCreighton plant, which employs 360 people.   Plants making made cough syrup, steel office furniture andelectronic circuit boards also either cut production or were closed.   Emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a45,000-gallon reservoir at Allegheny Valley Hospital, which drawsits water from the river. The hospital used paper plates and cupsto serve meals to its 225 patients, closed its laundry and sentdirty linens to another hospital.   At least nine school districts closed Monday, idling more than21,000 students.   Buckeye Pipeline Co. estimated 75,000 gallons of the mixed fuelflowed into the river. But John Kaus of the Allegheny CountyEmergency Management Authority and others said the amount wascloser to 200,000 to 300,000 gallons.   Buckeye permit manager Roy Haase Jr. said the company and itscontractors had recovered 50,000 gallons of a fuel-and-watermixture.   About 100 people worked to collect oil and build a dam below thespill site, where fuel continued to leach from a quagmire coveringthe pipe.   ``They are trying to stabilize that soil,'' Ms. Deitzel said.``It's a precarious situation because it's saturated with fuel. ...They're out there working with lifelines.''   Two years ago, an Ashland Oil tank ruptured, sending 713,000gallons of diesel fuel into the nearby Monongahela River andaffecting water supplies downtstream on the Ohio River as far awayas Sistersville, W.Va.</TEXT></DOC>
