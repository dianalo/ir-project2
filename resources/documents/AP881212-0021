John Isaacs, director of the liberal Council for a Livable World,agreed. ``I think that to the extent there's any disagreementbetween the two, it will be Quayle making the accommodation, notBush,'' he said.   Quayle, a Republican from Indiana, was one of the Senate's mostconservative members on national security issues during his eightyears in the chamber.   For example, Quayle voiced a series of questions and criticismsearlier this year about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treatynegotiated by President Reagan. Vice President George Bush stronglysupported the pact, which was ratified by the Senate.   Quayle, who eventually voted for the pact, said in a 1987interview that ``I have a lot of questions (about the INF treaty),and I don't believe in the long run, quite frankly, contrary to thepopular perception, that this is going to be a big political plusfor this administration.''   Quayle also has voiced skepticism about Reagan administrationefforts to negotiate a U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Talktreaty providing deep reductions in the long-range arsenals of eachnation. Bush has supported those efforts and pledged to work towarda START pact after he replaces Reagan on Jan. 20.   In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last Feb. 3 on theINF pact, Quayle said, ``If in fact we do not get a START agreement,it is not going to be the end of the world. As a matter of fact, itmight give us some time to see how the INF agreement is going to beimplemented.''   Bush, in his first debate with Democratic presidential candidateMichael Dukakis, said, ``We've achieved an arms control agreement(INF) that our critics thought was never possible. And I want tobuild on it _ I want to see us finalize the START agreement.''   Both Quayle and Bush have said the United States should benegotiating to reduce conventional weapons in Europe, where theSoviets have a large numerical advantage.   John Steinbrunner, director of foreign policy studies for theliberal Brookings Institution, said Quayle's influence is likely tobe limited when the Bush administration begins drafting arms controlpositions.   ``Quayle has been a classic hardliner on arms control, but Idon't think many people imagine that he's going to have a very greatweight in deliberations,'' Steinbrunner said. ``The speculationreally focuses on how Bush's own plans evolve.''   ``Quayle and other members of the right wing would have slowed upor strung out the INF treaty if they had the votes, but they showedthey didn't have the votes,'' Steinbrunner said. ``The right winghas limited appeal. It's very vociferous, it's very intense, but infact it's not in line with most people in the United States.''   Raymond Garthoff, who helped negotiate the SALT I andAnti-Ballistic Missile treaties, agreed that Quayle is likely tohave only limited influence.   ``Quayle won't differ publicly, but he may be a voice for theconservatives within the inner councils of the administration. Idon't expect that he'll have a large influence, but his opinion maybe sought by Bush to understand what the conservatives arethinking,'' Garthoff said.   Hackett concurred that Quayle is likely to seek to influenceadministration positions. ``Certainly Quayle will support theadministration in public, despite what it does, but I presume hewill have some influence in the in-house meetings that lead up tothe public positions,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
