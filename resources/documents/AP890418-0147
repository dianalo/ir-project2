The Commerce Department report said construction of new homesand apartments dropped 5.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 1.4 million units in March after plunging 12 percent inFebruary.   Construction of single-family homes slowed to an annual pace of994,000 units, the slowest rate since January 1985, while starts ofmulti-family dwellings fell 8.8 percent to an annual rate of403,000 units.   Applications for building permits, meanwhile, fell 13.7 percentin March after dropping 6.1 percent in the preceding month. Thatwas the biggest monthly drop since a 14 percent decline in October1981, in the early stages of the last recession.   Tuesday's report contained ``nothing but negatives'' for thenation's housing industry, said David Seiders, chief economist forthe National Association of Home Builders.   But that was seen as good news by those worried aboutaccelerating inflation, who hope that slower economic growth willhelp restrain price increases.   Analysts said the March report showed that housing is feelingthe pinch of interest rates pushed upward by the Federal ReserveBoard as part of its campaign to restrain the economy and checkinflation.   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages are now averaging 11.11 percent,up almost one full percentage point from a year ago, according to anational survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   ``Housing is always something that gets hit hard by higherinterest rates,'' said economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group inBala Cynwyd, Pa. ``The interest-sensitive sectors of the economywill bear the brunt of any downturn.''   Thomas Holloway, senior economist for the Mortgage BankersAssociation, said further weakness in housing is likely to show upin the next few months, but ``if we're lucky, the housing sectorwill probably emerge a little stronger than it is right now.''   Nevertheless, a growing number of analysts are worried that theFederal Reserve is unlikely to complete its anti-inflation campaignwithout pushing the country into a recession, with housing leadingthe way downward.   Housing is likely to ``lead us into a significant slowdown andultimately, probably, a mild recession,'' said Allen Sinai, chiefeconomist for the Boston Co. ``That probably will be the price paidto get inflation down.''   Economist Michael Sumichrast, publisher of a housing newsletter,said the Federal Reserve's tight money policy was ``killing housingvery successfully.''   ``It's clearly a housing recession,'' Sumichrast said. ``I thinkit's fair to say we are in the forefront of a recession. I don'tthink you can really turn it around any more.''   The weakness in March was led by a steep 34.1 percent drop inconstruction activity in the Northeast, where housing starts fellto an annual rate of 149,000 units, the slowest pace in the regionsince September 1983.   Seiders said that decline represented an ``inventorycorrection'' after heavy overbuilding in the region earlier in the1980s, when demand was strong and prices were rising.   Starts of new homes and apartments were off 5.2 percent in theSouth, dropping to an annual rate of 546,000 units, while starts inthe West dropped by 1 percent to a rate of 395,000 units.   The Midwest was the only region to enjoy an increase inactivity, with new construction climbing 10.4 percent to an annualrate of 307,000 units.   The 13.7 percent decline in building permits in March leftpermits at an annual rate of 1.22 million units, the slowest pacesince October 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
