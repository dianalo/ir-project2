Adam Zimmerman, chairman and chief executive officer of Noranda Forest, said at the annual meeting that Noranda would cover half the cost of the venture, including an expected cash outlay of about 200 million dollars during the next three years.    Noranda Inc., which also has mining and manufacturing interests, owns about 81.6% of Noranda Forest. Noranda Inc.'s forest-products assets were used to form Noranda Forest in May 1987.    Noranda Forest also reported first-quarter earnings of 62.9 million dollars, or 60 cents a share, up 49% from 42.2 million dollars, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to 1.09 billion dollars from 1.01 billion dollars.    Mr. Zimmerman said he expects Noranda Forest's 1988 earnings to be &quot;10% to 20% better than last year,&quot; when the company earned 203.2 million dollars, or 2.13 dollars a share, on revenue of 4.3 billion dollars.    Mr. Zimmerman said the Tasmanian mill would be able to produce about 440,000 tons of eucalyptus-based bleached hardwood kraft pulp annually. Production is expected to begin by 1991 or 1992.    Eucalyptus pulp is used to produce fine paper and tissue and is commonly used in Europe. He said more than 75% of the mill's output would be exported to North America, Europe and the Far East. Eucalyptus pulp can't be produced in North America, he said.    Melbourne-based North Broken Hill, through a subsidiary, is Australia's sole producer of high-quality fine and coated papers and has been seeking additional capacity in Tasmania where its operations have been running at peak output.    Separately, Noranda Forest said it also agreed to acquire for 30 million dollars Highland Forest Products, a waferboard maker in Scotland. The acquisition would give Noranda its first British production base and access to a product with high profit margins, Mr. Zimmerman said. </TEXT></DOC>
