WinterStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> COLUMBUS, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Douglas E. Olesen helps run an international concern with 8,100 employees and annual revenue of nearly $600 million -- and no shareholders. He says he likes it that way.    &quot;Pressure from Wall Street is something we don't have,&quot; says the former engineer.    Mr. Olesen, 48 years old, is executive vice president and chief operating officer of Battelle Memorial Institute, an engineering and research organization with research centers in the U.S., Switzerland and West Germany. Next month, he is expected to become president and chief executive officer, succeeding Ronald S. Paul, who turns 65 in January.    He will take charge of a strange hybrid. While Battelle operates like a business, it was founded as a charitable trust. The will of Gordon Battelle, heir to a modest steel fortune, established the concern &quot;for the encouragement of creative research . . . and the making of discoveries and inventions.&quot;    For nearly 60 years it has done just that. Battelle researchers originated many of the concepts behind the office copier, developed the &quot;sandwich&quot; of copper and nickel alloys that replaced silver U.S. coins in the late 1960s, devised the universal product code used in grocery checkouts and invented a holographic identification that appears on credit cards.    Like any other business executive, Mr. Olesen's major task is maximizing return on assets. He notes that Battelle's assets are mainly &quot;intellectual property&quot; -- patents and concepts arising from research, rather than plants and working capital. That's a plus, he contends, because &quot;technology is the driving force of industry,&quot; replacing natural resources and merchant fleets.    The slim 6-footer is determined to get Battelle a better return on its technology. He thinks that's possible by insisting that Battelle participate in marketing its technology, rather than simply accept a fee from a client to find solutions to a problem.    Battelle is at the forefront in a wide range of fields, including superconductivity, artificial intelligence, ceramic materials, biotechnology and the marriage of optics and electronics. It is also developing new methods for making steel, energy-saving materials for melting aluminum and more effective manufacturing automation. Much of the work seeks to better apply computers to business and scientific activities, an activity Mr. Olesen says is &quot;still in its infancy.&quot;    &quot;There isn't any fixed model&quot; as to how Battelle will try to market its own technology, he says. For instance, it set up separate companies to exploit some of its computer expertise, and it formed an optoelectronics joint venture with two Japanese concerns.    Battelle's marketing effort will benefit because Battelle is both a major government contractor and a supplier of research to hundreds of industrial concerns -- from International Business Machines Corp. to tiny companies that can't afford their own labs. Battelle's biggest commercial success came in the early 1960s, when it sold patents on xerography to Xerox Corp. -- for stock that soon soared in value.    Yet even if Mr. Olesen succeeds in expanding marketing, Battelle won't report a profit. While it paid $6.6 million of federal income taxes last year, Battelle's annual report doesn't even have a net income line. The bottom line -- $8.3 million last year -- is merely labeled &quot;excess of revenues over expenses.&quot;    Battelle's charitable contributions, which totaled about $1 million last year, roughly equate to the dividends publicly held companies pay, Mr. Olesen says. But Battelle's driving force is technology, not charity.    &quot;There's a premium on getting technology from development through commercialization faster than before,&quot; he says. In industry, &quot;intellectual property that leads to products for niche markets is more and more the name of the game.&quot;    At the same time, technology is more complex and comes from more sources. &quot;It is more difficult for a single organization or company to be self-sufficient,&quot; he maintains, giving Battelle an opportunity to become an important player in the entire process of developing and marketing technology rapidly.    For years, Battelle has had close relationships with businesses, but usually at the technician level. Mr. Olesen wants to move contacts up to the executive suite.    &quot;Doug is much more aggressive in the marketplace,&quot; says James E. Sorenson, Battelle's senior vice president for manufacturing. &quot;He gets out and has one-on-one meetings with chief executives of companies and learns where the market is going.&quot; Battelle must anticipate commercial demand five to eight years ahead, Mr. Sorenson adds.    Yet Mr. Olesen has little commercial business experience. He has worked at Battelle nearly all his adult life, signing on as an engineer at Battelle's Richland, Wash., unit in 1967.    His parents' small grocery store in Wenatchee, Wash., in the heart of the state's apple country, provides his only personal involvement with textbook private enterprise.    To fully exploit Battelle's marketing opportunities, Mr. Olesen will have to keep it from becoming a bureaucracy that rewards the status quo.    &quot;Doug is a merchant of change,&quot; says Merwyn R. VanderLind, senior vice president for electronics and defense systems. &quot;He tells us that if we can't be a part of, deal with and manage change, we might want to find someplace else to work.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
