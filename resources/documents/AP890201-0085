Greenpeace spokesman Paul Bogart said the Japanese ships hadstopped harpooning whales in a ``a major victory'' for theenvironmental organization, whose ship Gondwana has been trailingthe fleet for a week.   ``It looks like they are trying to sit us out,'' Bogart said byradio telephone from the Gondwana.   ``They spotted a pod of 12 Minke whales but sailed right throughthem. Maybe they are just tired of the hassles and are waiting forus to leave.''   Bogart said the Gondwana today sent up a helicopter to harass theJapanese whaling boats when the whales were spotted. On Tuesday, theGreenpeace ship collided with a Japanese whaling vessel. No injurieswere reported.   In Tokyo, a whaling official said he had no reports the fleet hadstopped working but said the ships may be forced to do so ``when andif it encounters harassment'' from Greenpeace ``in a way that wouldendanger ... lives.''   ``Any such suspension would not mean that the fleet has stoppedresearch whaling,'' said Hisashi Hiroyama of the Fisheries Agency.``The fleet will not return home until it accomplishes its researchmission in April.'' He said tactics used by the Greenpeace vesselwere ``tantamount to terrorism.''   Japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of itsscientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despitea moratorium imposed by the International Whaling Commission.Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushirestaurants in Japan.   The Greenpeace ship, carrying a crew of 19, is visitingAntarctica as part of its campaign to have the frozen continentdeclared a world park.   Another Greenpeace spokesman, Peter Wilkinson, said the Gondwanawill continue to shadow the Japanese fleet for another ``day ortwo,'' then journey to the U.S. base at McMurdo Sound, which thegroup claims is heavily polluted.   ``Then it will be fireworks,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
