Gelb, who took over the New York Timesforeign-affairs column this month. It's &quot;pure baloney&quot; thatwe have the Patriot anti-missile because President Reaganpushed his strategic defense initiative. And there's only &quot;agrain of very misleading truth&quot; in the argument that theReagan buildup provided the means to win in the Gulf. Mr.Gelb decides that real credit for high-tech success should goto the Carter administration, in the person of defensesecretary Harold Brown.   There's not much danger that anyone will actually believethis, of course, except perhaps in the little world whereCarter defense policies were mainstream and Reagan policies&quot;right-wing.&quot; And while the uncivil tone will give some kindof warning to Times readers, we wonder how many of them willrecall that Mr. Gelb held a high foreign-policy post in theCarter adminstration. An op-ed writer would have to disclosethis, but in prevailing journalistic ethics regularcolumnists are absolved, even rookies.</LP><TEXT>   Still, much can be learned from the history of the weaponsthat have just succeeded so spectacularly -- the Patriot, theTomahawk cruise missile, Stealth aircraft and the like. Thelesson is not strictly partisan. The Pentagon did not closeup during the Carter years. Mr. Brown indeed deserves creditfor helping along some programs, Stealth in particular,though research was started before Carter and full-scaleprocurement came after. And not all of the obstacles wereDemocrats, or even civilians.   With the Bush-Gorbachev summit now postponed, we hope thatthe Bush administration attends these lessons. For theyinvolve the curious philosophy embedded in arms-controlagreements like that contemplated for the next summit. Theidea is that war can be prevented by making sure that if itcomes everyone is destroyed; this is called mutual assureddestruction, or MAD. Under MAD logic, the best weapons arethose too terrible ever to use -- &quot;deterrent&quot; weapons. Andthe worst kind of weapons are those that actually might work-- &quot;war-fighting&quot; weapons. This had been the big obstacle forgood weapons to overcome.   Take the Patriot. Mr. Gelb finds an Army officer to quotethat the Patriot and SDI were &quot;absolutely&quot; separate programs.The SDI office, operating out of the normal chain of command,draws interservice rivalry from the Army, Navy and Air Force.And it is quite true that the anti-tactical missile program(ATM), upgrading the air-defense Patriot to give itcapability against Scuds and other intermediate-rangemissiles, was under the Army and not the SDI office.   The implications of ATM for SDI, however, were alwaysclear. The opposition to ATM came from SDI opponents,objecting that it would undercut the ABM treaty, whichseverely limits defenses against intercontinental ballisticmissiles. They argued that the ability to shoot down anyballistic missile would make the treaty's provisions hard topolice. An ATM, Brookings Institution author Raymond Garthoffargued, would provoke a &quot;highly negative&quot; response in Europebecause it would be a war-fighting capability.   Such objections, indeed, were a big reason the twoprograms were kept separate. Giving the Army part of theaction of course kept it happier, and the political problemwas eased by upgrading an air-defense weapon instead ofdeveloping a missile with a new name. Proponents of SDI sawthe ATM as the best bet for actually deploying hardware andkeeping the idea of missile defense moving forward. Theacknowledged point man on Capitol Hill was Senator DanQuayle, and the political strategy clicked. As we have seenon TV, the weapon was ready when it counted.   The Tomahawk had to overcome similar obstacles. MAD logicworks against highly accurate weapons, for fear they might beused in a &quot;first strike&quot; taking out an opponent's&quot;deterrent.&quot; As we have already recounted (&quot;Bad forCivilians,&quot; January 21), the Tomahawk had several harrowingescapes from the arms-control process. But when war came, itproved quite comforting to have a war-fighting capability.   The momentum of the Reagan buildup let the Patriot and theTomahawk breach the MAD line. Given the political dynamics,it probably could have been done no other way. Yes, the scaleof the push probably resulted in more waste than usual evenin a vast socialistic enterprise like the Pentagon. But then,the preconception that high-tech weapons never work, the mythof the $600 toilet seat, were basically publicity weapons.They were wielded by Congressmen and others not so much tocombat waste, fraud and abuse; the real purpose was to stopthe buildup.   It may drive Mr. Gelb totally over the brink, but the waywe look at it is this: Those Scuds over Tel Aviv and Riyadhare being knocked down by $600 toilet seats.</TEXT></DOC>
