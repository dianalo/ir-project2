Consideration is alsogiven to gender differences in light of evidence of an emerging gendergap in these two countries. The study investigates the common forcescited in two sets of literature - post-industrialism and anti-nuclearweapons movements - which provide a framework for analysis. Survey researchdata is employed to assess cross-national similarities and differences.The findings obtained indicate that while American and British activistsexhibit common social and value characteristics, British activists appearmore integrated in their political opposition to nuclear weapons comparedwith their American counterparts. Survey results indicate that the political-actionrepertoire of these activists is quite diverse, suggesting a new styleof politics in advanced industrial democracies. Gender-based analysisreveals two important findings. First, activist American men differ significantlyfrom the other three social groups in their attitudes towards nuclearweapons. Second, activist women in both national settings participateat a level equal to or exceeding that of activist men.</TEXT></DOC>
