Share prices were higher in thin trading in London, reached record levels again in Sydney and rose in Hong Kong but fell in Frankfurt and Singapore.    The Nikkei stock average fell 296.72 points to 25649.88, making a total drop of nearly 470 points, or 1.8%, in two days. Volume was 900 million shares, compared with 1.2 billion Wednesday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index slumped 29.09, or 1.36%, to 2110.38.    Traders cited the disclosure late Wednesday that Tateho Chemical Industries had paper losses of 20 billion yen ($142.2 million) in Japanese government bond trading, which was more than the company's net assets. They said this touched off fears of similar losses at other companies that have been using the financial markets to try to offset the impact of the Japanese yen's high value.    One broker said various groups of investors were making up lists of companies they believed also had bond market losses, leading to speculative selling.    Some traders said the market reaction to the Tateho incident probably will be brief. They said that investor sentiment and liquidity remain strong and that troubled companies could sell long-term securities investments to offset bond losses.    In the export-led electrical and computer shares sector, Alps Electric skidded 120 to 2,230 yen ($15.86) a share on rumors that it had suffered bond market losses. There was no confirmation of the reports.    Mitsubishi Metal fell 40 to 855, and Mitsubishi Rayon dropped 33 to 582. Both of them also were hit by bond-loss rumors.    &quot;Everybody has a different list&quot; of suspected bond-market losers, one trader complained.    Securities shares also were affected. Nikko Securities, Tateho's lead underwriter, fell 170 to 2,300 amid rumors of losses and possible irregularities in the case. Nomura Securities lost 120 to 4,670.    Tateho itself closed at 1,220 on an offers-only basis, down 300 for the day and 600 since Tuesday's close.    Aisin Seiki, a maker of car parts that sends 70% of its output to Toyota Motor, rose 40 to 1,080. The rise was credited to a Toyota denial that it plans to import parts from a manufacturing subsidiary in Kentucky. Toyota was unchanged at 1,920.    London shares ended higher in thin trading, bolstered by hopes that interest rates won't rise in the near future and by earnings reports.    The 100-share index closed 18.6 points higher at 2268.1. The Financial Times 30-share index rose 11.3 to 1774.5. The gold mines index rose 7.9 to 452.8. Volume was 500 million shares, compared with 448.1 million Wednesday.    Dealers cited further reaction to a statement Wednesday by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that last month's one-point rise in bank base lending rates was &quot;sufficient&quot; to ease inflationary pressures. Interest-sensitive stocks, including breweries, stores and building materials, posted gains as a result.    The market was also helped by several strong earnings reports. Cadbury Schweppes rose 4 pence to 274 pence ($4.53) a share after reporting pretax profit of #63.6 million ($105.2 million) for the 24 weeks ended June 20, above most market forecasts.    British Printing andamp; Communication said its first-half pretax profit more than doubled to #70.5 million from #27.5 million a year earlier. Its shares rose 19 to 395. Consolidated Gold Fields rose 37 to 1,440 pence in continued reaction to Monday's takeover offer in the U.S. for New York-based Newmont Mining, which is 26%-owned by Consolidated Gold.    Dealers said a &quot;bear squeeze&quot; lifted Reed International shares 24 to 543. They said market makers holding short positions had to scramble for more shares to meet demand spurred by the rising market.    In the Frankfurt market, a weaker dollar and lower West German bond prices forced stock prices down across the board in moderate trading.    Auto makers and banks led the decline, with Daimler-Benz falling 31 to 1,098 marks ($611.87) and Deutsche Bank slipping 12 to 695.    In the chemical sector, Henkel fell 11 to 572 despite posting higher first-half profit, BASF fell 3.30 to 335.80, and Bayer slid 5.30 to 353.20.    In Sydney, the Australian market's broadest index closed at a record for the second day in a row as surging prices for gold and silver in New York Wednesday boosted mining shares. Industrial issues climbed again on good earnings reports and takeover news.    The gold shares index rose 130 to 3990, giving it a gain of 219 points in three days. The Sydney All-Ordinaries Index rose 24.1 to a record 2203.7.    Hong Kong shares rose modestly in active trading as early profit-taking gave way to good buying interest from local traders and large program purchases. Utility shares posted sharp gains, and the property group made modest advances.    Singapore share prices fell in light trading as local investors decided the correction of the past week will continue and hurried to liquidate their holdings.    Shares rose in Stockholm, Brussels, Zurich and Paris but fell in Amsterdam and Milan. Paris saw active trading on foreign demand and a planned cut in the tax on automobile sales, dealers said. Analysts said the French government is likely to promote a firm stock market in the months leading up to next spring's presidential election.
