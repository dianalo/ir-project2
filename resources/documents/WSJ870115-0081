Claiborne deBorda Pell's colleagues say the new Foreign Relations chairman is absent-minded, and he agrees his memory sometimes fails him. They say his legislative interests -- such as oceanic law and converting to the metric system -- have been esoteric, and he takes no issue with that. They say he lacks dynamism, and he concurs.    &quot;The problem I'll have is I have the uncanny facility for making the most exciting matters gray,&quot; Princeton-educated Sen. Pell drones in his aristocratic accent. &quot;I'm a fairly modest fellow,&quot; the millionaire Rhode Island Democrat says, &quot;and time will have to show what sort of Foreign Relations Committee chairman I will be. I am less dynamic than many, but I have my own course which I set and try to follow.&quot;    As a traditional liberal Democrat, Sen. Pell's course now is to set legislative actions that will silence his critics and put Senate Democrats on the foreign-policy map ahead of the presidential-campaign season. He has scheduled a flurry of hearings that are engineered to take on a recalcitrant president over ratification of two long-forgotten U.S.-Soviet nuclear testing treaties. Other hearings will question the Reagan administration's manner of making foreign policy toward Iran and the Nicaraguan Contras, whom he calls &quot;our terrorists.&quot;    But in an institution where force of personality is often a key to influence, skeptics wonder whether Sen. Pell is up to his new post. Many Capitol Hill insiders fear that the 66-year-old senator is too much the kindly patrician to master the nitty-gritty of consensus building, managing floor battles and overriding or avoiding presidential vetoes. He has already had his first clash with the White House over verification language that could essentially kill treaties that Mr. Pell hoped would start momentum in the area he says he'll fight for hardest -- arms control.    At best, congressional insiders say, he will come under the thumb of Majority Leader Robert Byrd, (D., W.Va.), who expanded the size of the committee to 20 from 17 against Sen. Pell's wishes.    At worst, they say Sen. Pell will preside over the sinking of the committee into old divisions that could again make it more of a debating group than a policy leader. Its influence had been on a decadelong decline until reversed by the chairmanship of Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.).    &quot;Sen. Pell has a lot of eager horses chomping at the bit who are going to be difficult to control,&quot; Sen. Lugar says. &quot;Pell will have to think through whether legislation will pass or is doable. Is it something the president will sign? Or will the committee simply become a ginger group, a font of ideas without any assurance they are going anywhere.&quot;    Sen. Byrd argues that Sen. Pell, a former foreign service officer who has spent more than two decades on the committee, could surprise people. He once chose Mr. Pell to lead a group of Democratic senators who met with the late Soviet leader Yuri Andropov because of the senator's cool head. &quot;There are show horses and workhorses, and Pell is a workhorse,&quot; says Sen. Byrd. &quot;The same things have been said about me -- low key, no charisma. That doesn't bother me. I always think I've got a little more on the ball than the others knew about.&quot;    Sen. Pell's record is indeed more impressive than his Washington image, not a difficult feat, considering that congressional staff members of both parties refer to the eccentric legislator as &quot;the senator from outer space&quot; and &quot;Senator Magoo.&quot; He has initiated two treaties, one banning nuclear weapons on the ocean floor and another banning environmental alteration as a weapon of war. And his &quot;Pell grants&quot; have provided federal aid to millions of college students. &quot;That's more than I have done,&quot; says Sen. Byrd.    Part of Sen. Pell's image problem is that he is an anachronism in the media age.    He wears oversized, ill-cut suits -- some of which once belonged to his father -- that fit the 1930s far better than they do his bony frame. His jargon is as dated as his dress: He will admit to being &quot;at sixes and sevens&quot; over an issue, and he will speak of education as the &quot;warp and woof&quot; of our society. He sometimes greets journalists with the phrase, &quot;formal greetings,&quot; and he apologizes for sounding &quot;too peachy&quot; when speaking of the high calling of public service.    His hideaway office in the Capitol is decorated from carpet to vaulted ceiling with an array of ancestral mementos. There is the late 19th Century drawing of the jockey on the first American horse to win the English Derby, a steed owned by a great, great granduncle. There are pictures of five forebears who were members of Congress, the portrait of the relative who was vice president and another of the 18th Century French cousin named deBorda who invented the division sign and who is the source of Sen. Pell's middle name.    The room is littered with memories of his father, who was Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy to Portugal and a New York congressman from the city's silk-stocking district. He wears his father's belt with his dark suit, a clashing tan with a bronze buckle.    Sen. Pell has been faulted by some Rhode Islanders for ignoring bread-and-butter issues and pursuing his personal interests -- such as oceanography and railroads.    &quot;I've been vastly criticized in Rhode Island for my interest in seaweed and choo-choo trains,&quot; he says. He defends himself by noting that his passion for trains resulted in the modernization of the Northeast rail corridor. Rhode Island also gets $1.5 million in federal funding each year for a &quot;Sea Grant&quot; ocean research college.    Despite the criticism of the senator's legislative interests, Rhode Island's ethnic, predominantly Catholic blue-collar voters have continued to support this WASP millionaire, and they elected him the last two times with more than 70% of the vote.    &quot;They look on him favorably because there is no question about his honesty and integrity or having a hand in the cash register,&quot; says Elmer Cornwell, a Brown University political scientist and member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives.    But what Pell watchers like talking about more than his past or his legislative history are the anecdotes that follow the senator like a shadow.    Last year, for example, Sen. Pell grew confused by the rigors of speaking before three different committee hearings -- Foreign Relations on Jordanian arms sales, Labor on requiring manufacturers to list salt content on food labels, and before the education subcommittee on financing federal scholarships for poor students.    Mr. Pell rushed into the salt-labeling hearing, announced he was expected momentarily at the Foreign Relations Committee and began reading a statement on the urgent need for Pell grants. After a minute or two, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) mercifully whispered in his ear. &quot;I apologize deeply,&quot; Mr. Pell said, smiling sheepishly, then waving his hand and fleeing.    Everyone's favorite story, though, is about the pair of rubber boots an aide bought for Sen. Pell's shoes when a rainstorm began as the senator was campaigning on the streets of Providence some years ago. The senator asked the aide in his formal manner, &quot;To whom am I indebted for these fine rubbers?&quot;    &quot;I got them at Thom McAn's, senator,&quot; the aide answered.    &quot;Well, do tell Mr. McAn,&quot; replied the senator, &quot;that I'm much obliged to him.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
