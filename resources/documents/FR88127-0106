The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit commentson the proposed rule change from interested persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the ``Board'') is filing herewithan amendment to Board rule A-3 on the nomination and election of Boardmembers. The proposed rule change would delegate more authority to theBoard's Nominating Committee and would delete the ability of 20 percentof municipal securities dealers to nominate an additional candidate foreach industry position to be filled. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule Change (a) Board rule A-3(c) contains procedures for the nomination and electionof Board members. The Board has adopted revisions to these procedures whichdelegate more authority to the Nominating Committee. The Board believesthat these revisions will retain the Board's primary goals in its selectionof new Board members: providing equal representation on the Board by bankdealers, securities firms, and public members within the framework of staggeredterms of office; assuring broad diversity in the background of Board members;establishing a workable democratic procedure for the nomination and electionof Board members; and tailoring a suitably deliberative framework for theelection process. <ITAG tagnum="81">Membership of the Nominating Committee </ITAG>Under rule A-3(c) (ii), the Nominating Committee currently consists offive senior class members of the Board and six persons who are not membersof the Board consisting of two representatives each of securities firms,bank dealers and the public. The proposed rule change provides that theNominating Committee will consist of six Board members and three personswho are not members of the Board. Of the six Board members, two each willrepresent securities firms, bank dealers and the public. The Board hasconcluded that it is appropriate to provide some continuity from year-to-yearof Board member representatives on the Nominating Committee. Therefore,the six Board members may be chosen from any of the three member classes.Of the three non-Board members, one each will represent securities firms,bank dealers and the public, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="81">Nominations Procedure </ITAG>Under current rule A-3(c) (iv), the Nominating Committee nominates threepersons for each of the Board positions to be filled. The Board electsone of the three nominees. The proposed rule change provides that the NominatingCommittee will submit only one nominee for each available Board position.Under this approach, the Board will communicate with the Nominating Committeethe qualifications of individuals the Committee should consider and latermay review the list of all possible nominees. When the Committee determinesits slate of nominees, it will contact these individuals and ask them ifthey wish to serve on the Board, subject to the Board's approval. If theyagree, their names will be presented to the Board. The Board will acceptor reject the slate of nominees. It is anticipated that the Board willvote to accept the nominees. In the event a nominee is rejected, however,the Nominating Committee must hold a meeting to choose another nominee.The Board believes that this non-competitive election process will ensurethat highly qualified individuals are nominated to become members of theBoard. <ITAG tagnum="81">Industry Nomination Process </ITAG>Under current rule A-3(c) (vi), (vii) and (viii), 20 percent of municipalsecurities dealers may nominate an additional candidate for each of theindustry positions to be filled. When the Board adopted this procedureit indicated that it was intended as a ``safety valve'' in the event therewas substantial industry disagreement with the candidates nominated bythe Board. In the ten years the rule has been in effect, there have beenno industry candidates nominated in this fashion. Moreover, as a practicalmatter, it appears that this procedure would be difficult to implement.The Board believes that its nomination and election process has resultedin industry candidates that are able and representative of municipal securitiesdealers and, as a result, this alternative nomination procedure shouldbe deleted from the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Miscellaneous </ITAG>The proposed rule change deletes from rule A-3 references to specific datesin the rule. The Board anticipates that its revised nominations processwill require frequent meetings of its Nominating Committee and it doesnot appear practical to confine Committee action by imposing the time framescurrently provided for in the rule.(b) The Board has adopted the proposed rule change pursuant to section15B(b)(I) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ``Act'').Section 15B(b)(2)(I) authorizes and directs the Board to adopt rules providingfor the operation and administration of the Board.B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe proposed rule change does not affect the conduct of business by anybroker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer. The Board therefore believesthat the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on competition.C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants, or othersThe Board neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rulechange.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action</ITAG>The Board requests the Commission to find good cause for approving theproposed rule change prior to the 35th day after its publication in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>under section 19(b)(2) of the Act if the approvaldate would not occur prior to February 12, 1988. The Board wishes to approvethe members of the Nominating Committee at its February 17-19, 1988 meeting.The Nominating Committee, under the proposed rule change, will be constituteddifferently than under the current rule. In addition, the Committee willbe required to meet more frequently in order to ensure that the nominationsprocedure is completed in time for a Board vote on the nominee slate totake place prior to the expiration of the term of the current senior classon September 30, 1988. If the proposed rule change is not effective byFebruary 12, 1988, it will be difficult for the Board to discuss a listof possible committee members at the February 17-19 meeting and to beginthe nominations process. Therefore, the Board believes that good causeexists to accelerate the effectiveness of the proposed rule change undersection 19(b)(2) of the Act if such acceleration is necessary to obtaineffectiveness of the proposed rule change on or prior of February 12, 1988.The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto the Board.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
