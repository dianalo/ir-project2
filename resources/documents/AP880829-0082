Dan Quayle, readying for this week'sSouthern campaign swing, says he ``will eventually be an asset'' tothe Republican ticket and overcome the controversies that havestalked his candidacy.   In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press as he flew homefrom his first solo campaign trip as the GOP vice presidentialnominee, Quayle acknowledged that he was still getting used to hisnew situation.   ``It's a little bit new, but what I will continue to do is justproject my vision of America, talk about why George Bush will offerthe best hope for continued prosperity.''   Quayle says he talks ``periodically, but not daily'' to Bush,and that the two men will probably spend more time campaigningseparately than together in order to better cover the country.   Quayle, 41, comes from a wealthy Indiana publishing family andhis candidacy has been dogged by suggestions that strings werepulled to get him into the National Guard during the Vietnam Warand law school after a mediocre college performance. Quayle hasdenied those charges, but the issues have threatened at times tooverwhelm his campaign.   Some major newspapers in editorials this week suggested that heremove himself from the ticket, and even some Republicans haveadmitted being uncomfortable with the senator, who was largely anunknown quantity when he was picked. In the interview, Quayle saidhe has had no second thoughts about running and was not hurt bysuggestions he step down.   ``I will eventually be an asset to the ticket,'' Quayle said.``I feel that I have a lot to offer in leadership. I feel I have alot to offer in the area of national defense. I feel that I haveworked very hard in the area of arms control.''   Meanwhile, The Boston Globe reported Monday that Quayle, whowould head the federal fight against drugs if Bush won in November,said he did not know that the vice president heads a key anti-drugprogram.   Quayle told the newspaper he was familiar ``in a general sense''with the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System but did notknow who led it. Bush has headed the system since it was created in1983.   In his remarks to The AP, Quayle said he was proud of his workwith Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., on a 1982 jobs training actwhich is ``very important to millions of people that have gottenjobs around America.''   Quayle also said he hoped to release his income tax returns soonbecause they would dispel notions that he is fabulously wealthy.   ``I keep telling them to get it out as soon as possible so wecan get rid of another untruth out there about how wealthy I reallyam,'' Quayle said. ``You're going to be shocked ... when you seethose tax returns.''   Quayle traveled to the Midwest and West last week, and willleave again Wednesday for a swing through the Southeast that willtake him through to Labor Day.   In last week's seven-state trip, Quayle spent little timetalking about his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,except to praise Bentsen for his views on defense spending andother issues. Most of his speeches outline a view that a victory byDemocratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis would be a disasterfor the country.   ``I've served with Sen. Bentsen for almost eight years. He isnot the issue,'' Quayle said. ``The issue is Michael Dukakis.Michael Dukakis' view of America is a much different view thanGeorge Bush's. Michael Dukakis' approach to national defense, hisapproach to the economy, his approach to child care _ all of thoseapproaches are much different than George Bush's.''   Quayle said he is not disturbed by polls that show much of thepublic views Bentsen as more qualified for the vice presidentialspot, and to be president if it comes to that.   ``The American people are just beginning to see Dan Quayle,'' hesaid. ``I'm going to continue to talk about the issues. When wehave the debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle, the Americanpeople will have a lot better picture of who will be the bestqualified vice presidential candidate.''</TEXT></DOC>
