Allan McArtor told the House aviation subcommittee Tuesday thata yearlong inspection of the nation's commuter carriers will resultin better crew training standards. The first draft is expected bythe fall, he said.   ``I feel strongly that the most important steps we can take toimprove safety are to enhance air crew performance,'' McArtor said.``That will provide the largest safety benefits in the long run.''   At the same hearing, McArtor's agency came in for criticism by amember of the National Transportation Safety Board, the federalagency that oversees accidents.   ``A sufficient margin of safety in air carrier operations canonly be achieved through effective surveillance by FAAinspectors,'' John K. Lauber said. ``However, we continue to findevidence in our accident investigations of spotty and ineffectiveFAA surveillance of commuter airlines.''   Commuter airlines, which primarily rely upon small,propeller-driven planes to serve small communities, have grownrapidly in recent years. The number of passengers they fly annuallyhas grown from 12.9 million in 1980 to 27.2 million last year.   But after a record-low accident rate in 1986, the commuterssuffered 33 accidents and 58 fatalities last year, the highesttotals in the 1980s, according to FAA figures. Six commuteraccidents and 22 deaths have occurred so far this year.   Lauber said the growth of air travel has increased demand forpilots, causing the major airlines to hire fliers away from thesmaller commuter carriers. This forces the commuters to fill theirown jobs with pilots who have less experience than in the past, hesaid.   ``In the current era of rapid pilot turnover and the hiring ofless-experienced pilots in the commuter industry, this question ofpilot experience is becoming even more critical,'' Lauber said.   McArtor, however, said an examination of the pilots involved inlast year's commuter airline accidents doesn't support theconclusion that inexperience has been a factor in the recentcrashes.   He said statistics gathered by the FAA covering most of thepilots indicated that on average, they had sufficient experience.   Lauber said other problems commuter airlines face include a lackof simulators to train pilots, instruments that vary widely and canconfuse fliers and excessive cockpit noise that inhibitscommunication between crew members.</TEXT></DOC>
