Jose E. Menendez, 45 years old, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were found shot to death in their Beverly Hills home late Sunday evening. Yesterday, the Beverly Hills Police Department declined to provide any additional information on their investigation.    Roger R. Smith, acting president of Live Entertainment, said, &quot;I regard any suggestion of {organized crime involvement} as bizarre and offensive.&quot; Live Entertainment is a major distributor and retailer of video and recorded entertainment.    Questions regarding possible organized crime involvement in the killings have been raised because of Live's recent purchase of BeckZack Corp., which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailing chain in the Northeast. Live purchased the company from Morris Levy, who was convicted in May 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler. He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction.    An FBI affidavit filed in federal court in New York in connection with an investigation of Mr. Levy quoted an unnamed federal informant as saying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interest in the Strawberries chain.    It isn't clear whether federal investigators ever followed up on the informant's statement, and the matter wasn't mentioned at Mr. Levy's trial. The assistant U.S. attorney who handled the Levy prosecution said he couldn't comment beyond the affidavit. The affidavit called Mr. Levy &quot;a lucrative source of cash and property for leaders of the Genovese&quot; crime family.    Mr. Smith said Live Entertainment spent six months in an exhaustive process of due diligence before completing the purchase of BeckZack in June for $40.5 million. &quot;We engaged lawyers who specialized in white-collar criminal areas. We found the operation of Strawberries to be whistle clean,&quot; Mr. Smith said.    Mr. Smith said Mr. Levy had owned a 90% stake in the company. He declined to identify the other owners but insisted none of them had any organized crime ties. &quot;There was no reason for any suspicion about any&quot; of the other owners, he said.    In Hollywood yesterday, rumors circulated that a neighbor had spotted two gunmen entering the Menendez home after the family's two sons went out Sunday evening. But the police department declined to confirm the rumors. An investigator for the Los Angeles County Coroner said earlier that the murder appeared to be &quot;a {professional} hit.&quot;    Yesterday Live Entertainment's stock continued to slide, falling $1.50 to $17 a share in national over-the-counter trading, though industry analysts and company officials expect Live to continue on a steady course of growth.    In the short-term, &quot;There's a cloud over the stock,&quot; said Keith E. Benjamin, an entertainment analyst at Silberg Rosenthal andamp; Co. who has recommended the stock. &quot;But the value he {Menendez} built didn't go away when he did.&quot;    Live Entertainment, which is 49%-owned by Carolco Pictures Inc., was formed in February 1988 by the combination of International Video Entertainment Inc., an ailing home entertainment software concern, and Lieberman Enterprises Inc., a Minneapolis-based distributor of recorded music, videocassettes and computer software. Mr. Menendez was credited with being responsible for the sharp gains in revenue and earnings at the company.    Such was Mr. Menendez's value that Live Entertainment took out a $15 million key-man life insurance policy on the executive. In 1988, the company had net income of $17.5 million, or $3.22 a share, on sales of $352.1 million.    &quot;The stock became known in the investment community. There were three analysts really tracking the stock, and all of us were positive,&quot; said Mr. Benjamin.    Analysts noted that Mr. Menendez has sharply cut costs at Live Entertainment, aggressively pursued new business and hired new executives to head the International Video Entertainment and Lieberman Entertainment divisions. &quot;Basically there are people there who are capable of handling the operations,&quot; said Lisbeth Barron, an analyst at McKinley Allsopp Inc. &quot;Essentially, there isn't anything to indicate yet that the company won't be right on track.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
