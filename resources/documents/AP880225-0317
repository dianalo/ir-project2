Gold prices edged up in New York after falling sharply in Europe.   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price forgold of $433 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Wednesday's late bid.   The dollar rose in Europe on expectations that the U.S.government would revise its estimate of growth in the grossnational product for the fourth quarter of 1987 to 5 percent from4.2 percent.   But the report, released in the middle of the European tradingday, put the latest estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth at4.5 percent.   As a result, the dollar turned lower, finishing the day in NewYork at lower levels than it traded at late Wednesday.   Dan Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp. in New York,said some traders bought dollars before the trade report wasreleased because they interpreted President Reagan's comments onthe economy at a news conference Wednesday night as indicatinggrowth had been stronger than expected.   But, he said, once the report was released and the revision wasonly modest, some dollar traders sold the U.S. currency.   Jack Barbanel, senior vice president at Gruntal andamp; Co., said thedollar took its cues from the bond market where a rally faltered atmidday.   ``There is a considerable amount of confusion in the financialmarkets'' about the strength of the econonmy, he said.
