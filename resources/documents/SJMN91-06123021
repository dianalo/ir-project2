Things arehappening so fast that the mood of investors can change from euphoric topessimistic during lunch. As my barber reminded me recently, the world managedto squeeze in a full-fledged war between haircuts.;    Investor confidence isdriven by a daily stream of current events, and the investing public is doingflip-flops trying to figure out which news is pertinent. But the past sixmonths have provided us with a rare opportunity for a crash course in prudentinvesting, says H. Bradlee Perry, chairman of David L. Babson andamp; Co. inCambridge, Mass.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  8 TIPS TO IMPROVE YOUR INVESTING -- AND YOURSLEEP  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Although the headlines change every day, Perry has come up with eightinvesting tips that he feels are as good in 1991 as they were in 1952, when hegraduated from Harvard Business School.;    In a recent speech, Perry offeredthese timely tips for those who may feel that their emotions cannot stand theconstant barrage of good and bad news:;    (check) Market timing fails moreoften than it succeeds.;    (check) Unexpected events occur frequently.;   (check) Investors' mood swings are often extreme.;    (check) Interest ratesare a powerful and often misleading influence on equity investors.;    (check)Severe industry problems push down the price of a strong company's stock aswell as a weak one's.;    (check) When strong companies encounter specificproblems, usually they overcome them.;    (check) Any sensible investmentstrategy works well if you are patient.;    (check) Long-term investors notonly do well, but they also sleep well.;    Although Perry thinks that thosebasic principals have remained true since he has been involved with the stockmarket, he is also quick to admit that there are some dangers to moderninvestors that have not always been there.;    Modern technology, rapidcommunications, program trading and the ability to instantaneously jump fromequities to money-market funds and back again in the same week, said Perry,may be exciting, but they actually may be working against the best interest ofsome investors. In an action-oriented era, he explained, &quot;those who want to besophisticated and up-to-date feel that they have to follow those practices.&quot;;   At 64, Perry said he has not strayed from his belief that &quot;market timing wasa delusion&quot; and that sticking to sound, long-term investments is still the wayto go.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DICK MARLOWE, Orlando Sentinel  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910502  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  393  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 2, 199100123021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
