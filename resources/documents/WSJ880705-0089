This is causing some concern in the world's most crowded corner.    China greeted the prospect with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep practicing birth control. In Tokyo, a group of experts gathered to debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people.    Takashi Sato, Japan's minister of agriculture, said Friday that &quot;excessive population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and energy . . . and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries.    &quot;Without global-level responses to the issues of population, food, environment and development,&quot; he said, &quot;it would be difficult for the world to welcome a peaceful 21st century.&quot; Mr. Sato is chairman of the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, which sponsored the conference.    In July 1987, the world's population passed five billion, double the population in 1950.    According to United Nations estimates, Asia's population will reach three billion on Aug. 10. Asia experts, however, predict the milestone will be reached within days.    Prof. Gayl D. Ness of the University of Michigan, a sociologist and researcher on Asian population, estimated that Asia's population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of the century -- and to 4.5 billion by the year 2025 while the world population reaches 8.2 billion.    Rice production will have to increase 50% by 2025 to feed the continent, Prof. Ness said, but great gains already have been registered by farmers in China, Japan and Southeast Asia.    The 21st century targets, he said, &quot;are well within the realm of possibility if the agricultural transformation continues; this, of course, requires sensitive government policies.&quot;    Asia, said Prof. Ness, has made &quot;substantial progress&quot; in lowering fertility rates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies to limit population growth.    But he noted disparities between regions of Asia. East Asian countries such as China, which has 1.08 billion people, and Japan, which has 122 million, have rapidly declining fertility rates. But in South Asia, India is still experiencing 2.08% annual growth in its current population of 818 million; Pakistan has 3.45% growth with 115 million people; and Bangladesh has a 2.67% growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according to U.N. figures.    &quot;The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the death rates,&quot; Prof. Ness said.    He and other panelists were critical of the United States for withdrawing money from the U.N. Fund for Population Activities because of the fund's support for abortion.    The population growth also has caused some social changes.    Prof. Toshio Kuroda, director emeritus of Tokyo's Institute of Population at Nihon University, noted that China &quot;expects the family to care for the aged . . . but the family is undergoing tremendous change in China with the one-child family.&quot;    China, the world's most populous country, has since the early 1980s limited most families to one child. But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years.    In Beijing, Chinese officials heralded the Day of Three Billion in Asia with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People. They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers, doctors and others for &quot;outstanding performance in implementing our population policy.&quot; Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to economic development. Said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman:   &quot;We cannot think that we can have more children because of economic development . . . nor can we relax our efforts because of progress in family planning.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
