She gave the property, estimatedto be worth at least $500,000, to the city on condition that the propertybecome a park or cultural center and that it not be sold or turned into aparking lot.;    Although the city had anticipated taking control of theproperty last December, it was not until March that probate was completed. Ashort time later, staff members inspecting the house found the old fuel tankand decided an investigation was needed before the city accepted the house.;   Once that is completed, the city council will choose a non-profitorganization that will make the best use of the property. Already, groups suchas the Peninsula Conservation Center Foundation have been lobbying for along-term lease on the building, which the city probably will award for anominal amount in exchange for the tenant's commitment to refurbish thehouse.;    Other groups expected to vie for the property include the Palo AltoUrban Ministry, the Palo Alto Centennial Committee, backers of a lace museum,Neighbors Abroad and the Creighton Health Institute.;    City officials areunsure how long it will be before an organization is chosen. But if nocontamination is found, a decision could be made in three months, Fellmansaid.;    The 1,800-square-foot house built on two-thirds of an acre is one ofonly two Palo Alto homes designed by Ernest Coxhead, an important Bay Areaarchitect of the period.;    The Williams house is the first major piece ofproperty the city has inherited since the Gamble estate in 1981.;    ThomasWilliams, a graduate of Stanford University, became a health officer as wellas one of the city's first physicians. He served on the city council from 1923to 1926.;    He also was active in the Stanford athletics program and iscredited with suggesting that Stanford build the football stadium that standstoday.;    &quot;It's a very important house, architecturally,&quot; Councilwoman GailWoolley said. &quot;I'm concerned we do a good job with it. The Gamble house tooksome time, too, and that turned out to be a valuable asset for the city.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROLYN JUNG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910703  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  524  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 3, 199100185295,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
