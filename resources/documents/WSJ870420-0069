With great fanfare, the superpowers are edging toward an agreement that could rid Europe of more than a thousand medium-range and short-range nuclear missiles. But that would be only a modest step in the right direction.    Without an accompanying strategic arms-reduction agreement, the Soviets will still have some 10,000 nuclear weapons, enough to aim two apiece at all of the 300-odd strategic targets in Western Europe, with more than enough left over to destroy the 2,000 major military targets in the U.S. America, likewise, will retain enough nuclear firepower to annihilate both Eastern Europe and the Soviet homeland.    The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are still at loggerheads over President Reagan's Star Wars defense program. This means that a far more important deal to reduce the bloated American and Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons isn't likely, at least until after Mr. Reagan leaves office in 1989.    But even without a new strategic-arms treaty, there are steps the West could take to reduce the risk of nuclear war and to stymie Soviet efforts to weaken the Atlantic alliance. &quot;If you depend only on arms control to enhance crisis stability, that's stupid,&quot; says Stephen M. Meyer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.    During the past decade, however, the West's infatuation with arms control sometimes has gotten in the way of other sensible efforts to prevent East-West conflicts from escalating into a holocaust. Congressional attempts to link defense spending to progress in arms negotiations, for example, have threatened to give the Soviets a voice in U.S. defense planning and have undermined programs to strengthen nuclear deterrence.    The administration's decision to ignore existing strategic-arms limits has distorted some defense programs. The administration can't simply abandon the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, known as Start. Doing so would set off needless shock waves in Congress and in Western Europe, and hand the Soviets a propaganda victory. Moreover, while an agreement doesn't appear likely soon, the administration can still try to pave the way for one later.    It can, for example, try to incorporate recent Soviet concessions on verifying a European missile agreement into the Start talks and continue to press for sublimits on the most threatening strategic weapons. And it can embrace Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion last week that experts from both sides search for a compromise on limiting development and testing of strategic defenses.    But even if such efforts come to nothing, the U.S. and its allies can act to help ensure that no East-West conflict ever escalates into nuclear war. One place to start is by seeing to it that removing medium-range and short-range nuclear missiles doesn't undermine Europe's defenses.    First, the West must counter recent improvements in Warsaw Pact conventional forces. For a decade, the Soviet general staff has been seeking ways to defeat the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without using nuclear weapons. In fact, some marshals -- although certainly not all -- may have encouraged Mr. Gorbachev to push for a &quot;denuclearized&quot; Europe. &quot;Everything they're doing now adds to their advantage,&quot; retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft says of Moscow.    Second, NATO must retain its nuclear-capable aircraft and the independent British and French nuclear forces, weapons that give the West retaliatory options between conventional warfare and all-out strategic nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Prof. Meyer suggests that Washington could dedicate a naval force equipped with nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles to NATO.    Third, the alliance must pay close attention to the details of any agreement to remove short-range nuclear missiles from Europe. Because such missiles can carry conventional or chemical warheads in addition to nuclear ones, the West should insist that the Soviets remove both their missiles and their launchers.    There also are unilateral steps the U.S. could take to improve the credibility of the West's ultimate deterrent, American strategic nuclear forces, and at the same time to make them less suited for a sneak attack on the Soviets. Replacing multiple-warhead missiles based in silos with mobile missiles, especially single-warhead ones, could improve what experts call &quot;crisis stability.&quot; So could badly needed improvements in the command, control, and communications of U.S. strategic nuclear forces and the development of so-called &quot;stealth&quot; bombers equipped with relatively slow-flying cruise missiles.    Morton H. Halperin, the director of the Center for National Security Studies, goes even further. In &quot;Nuclear Fallacy,&quot; a provocative new book, he argues that because nuclear weapons are no longer useful in fighting a war, the U.S. should create a separate nuclear command whose only function is maintaining deterrence.    Such steps, and others like them, could pay a double dividend. They could help reduce the risk of nuclear war and, as Oxford University historian Michael Howard says, they could help &quot;reassure&quot; Western publics that strengthening allied defenses will make the world safer, not more dangerous. </TEXT></DOC>
