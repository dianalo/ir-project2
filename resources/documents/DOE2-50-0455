<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0455 </DOCNO><TEXT>A power plant comprises a free piston gas generator having compressionchambers and motor cylinders. A reciprocable assembly has driven pistonswhich are solidably received in the motor cylinders and compression pistons,each slidable for defining a variable volume compression chamber. A rotarycompressor delivers air at above atmospheric pressure to the compressorchambers which are distributed into a first set and a second set. Theoutlets of the first set deliver air to the motor cylinders. The secondset delivers pressurized air to the exhaust gas and the mixture is admittedinto a power gas turbine. The temperature of the mixture of hot air andexhaust gas is increased before delivery to the turbine by a heat exchangerand a compression chamber. A specific object of the invention is to providea power unit which associates the high air compression efficiency ofalternating machines and the high degree of efficiency and long lifeof gas turbines. To illustrate the invention, an example of the powerunit is presented representative of a power plant in the 50 MW range.2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
