The emphasis is on the organismicprocess of selection, and on how the study of selection means connectingvariation at the molecular, biochemical, and phenotypic levels of organizationwith the resulting variation in fitness. This book illustrates that thetendency to view single locus differences in isolation as the buildingblocks of evolution is disappearing.</TEXT></DOC>
