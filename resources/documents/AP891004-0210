Machinists,angered by what they called a stingy wage offer from the aerospacegiant, hit the picket lines Wednesday and said they would remain onstrike until they got a better offer.   Pickets walked in 45-degree weather outside one of Boeing'sSeattle plants, waving signs as motorists and truck drivers honkedhorns.   ``The attitude's good,'' said Machinist Brian McTighe. ``Peopleare willing to picket, willing to do whatever it takes. Theattitude seems to be militant.''   The Machinists union, which represents 43,000 Boeing workers inthe Puget Sound area, 12,000 at Boeing's Wichita, Kan., plant,1,700 in Portland, Ore., and smaller numbers in a half-dozen otherlocations, struck at 12:01 a.m. PDT when its contract expired.   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who joined the talks over theweekend, said he wanted negotiations to resume quickly between thetwo sides because of the number of people affected and thepotential impact of a long strike at Boeing, Washington's largestprivate employer.   No talks were announced, although both sides indicated Tuesdaythey were willing to resume negotiating.   Members of other unions reported to work Wednesday, and Boeingcontinued production work in the Seattle area with management andnon-union employees.   Boeing spokesman Russ Young said the strike began peacefullywith no reports of friction at any of the company's plants.   However, at the request of Boeing lawyers, a federal judge inWichita issued an injunction limiting the number of pickets atBoeing gates and prohibiting pickets from speaking in an abusive orintimidating manner to employees trying to report for work.   The order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headedtoward the plant, attempting to persuade the occupants to honorstrike lines. Traffic was snarled, with delays of three hours ormore reported.   Boeing's contract offer included an immediate raise of 4 percentwith 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, plus annual bonuses of8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent thenext.   Workers haven't had an increase in base wages _ which determinepensions and other benefits _ for six years, although Boeing paidbonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988.   The proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and thecost-of-living adjustment.   For the average Machinist making $13.39 per hour, the offerwould have meant an additional $13,800 in income over the nextthree years.   The Machinists have declined to disclose their exact bargainingposition. However, members have indicated they were disappointed bythe proposed pay raise from Boeing, which is enjoying recordprosperity, and were upset the offer did not end mandatory overtime.   ``Most people we talked to were basically insulted by thecontract,'' said picket Bryce Bushby.   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 inwestern Washington. The company posted a profit of $614 million on$16.96 billion in sales last year.   The strike hits Boeing in its fifth consecutive year of recordjetliner orders as airlines update aging fleets. The wave of ordershas caused huge backlogs, pressuring Boeing to maintain deliveryschedules and forcing workers to put in heavy overtime.   Although Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business forBoeing's other divisions, Boeing Commercial Airplanes has a backlogof nearly 1,600 jets worth about $70 billion and deliveriesextending well into the mid-1990s.   The Machinists union represents the bulk of the company'sproduction workers, who perform tasks ranging from riveting, wiringand plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and machine-toolmaintenance.   Young declined to say how the strike would affect Boeing'saircraft deliveries and said there were no immediate plans to bringin outside workers.</TEXT></DOC>
