Transport Minister Paul Quiles issued the order afterreleasing a preliminary report from a committee investigatingthe crash last month of an Airbus A-320 in eastern France.Mr. Quiles, adopting the panel's recommendations, also urgedFrench aviation authorities to require planes to carryspecial systems for warning pilots flying at low altitudesand to examine the placement of rescue beacons on aircraft.</LP><TEXT>   The display system shows pilots the plane's rate ofdescent and flight path.   The report is the first official statement concerning theJan. 20 crash that killed 87 of the 96 people on board theAir Inter airline flight as it approached Strasbourg. Thecrash rekindled questions about the plane's high-technologycontrol system, which has been criticized by French pilotssince its introduction as overly sophisticated andsusceptible to computer error.   The committee, however, stressed that its report doesn'treflect any conclusions on the cause of the accident. Thefull inquiry into the crash is expected to take another year,the panel said.   Airbus responded to the report by saying it already hasset up a team of its own specialists to study crew proceduresand the display. Airbus said its team is to work alongsideaviation authorities and A-320 customers.   The European aircraft manufacturing consortium defendedthe A-320, saying: &quot;This display mode was developed at therequest of, and in concert with, the airline customers aswell as the various international certification and flightinspection authorities.&quot;   The Airbus consortium includes Aerospatiale of France,British Aerospace PLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. ofSpain and Deutsche Airbus, a unit of Germany's Daimler-BenzAG.   French pilots welcomed the panel's suggestions as partialvindication of their criticism of the plane. &quot;We aresatisfied because it is the first time the A-320 cockpit hasbeen questioned,&quot; said Jean-Paul Maurel, secretary general ofthe Air Inter division of the French pilots union.   Air Inter said it has already informed its pilots of therisks of confusion between the &quot;vertical speed&quot; and &quot;flightangle&quot; descent modes when using the display system. Theairline, an Air France subsidiary serving the French domesticmarket, said it is ready to help in finding ways ofeliminating the risk of confusion.   In its other recommendations, the committee focused lesson the A-320 itself. First, the panel recommended amendingFrench law to make it mandatory for all aircraft to have&quot;ground proximity warning systems,&quot; which alert pilots flyingat low altitudes.   These warning systems, introduced in the early 1980s, arealready on most planes, including the A-320. But Air Inter isthe only A-320 operator to decide against the installation ofthe system. Yesterday, the airline said it planned to havethe warning systems installed in all of its planes by summer.   Finally, the investigation committee recommended a reviewof the installation and operation of beacons that helprescuers locate a downed plane. The Air Inter flight's rescuebeacon failed to work after the crash and French search teamstook more than four hours to find the crashed A-320, leavingsurvivors stranded in freezing temperatures.   Although welcoming the recommendations, Mr. Maurel of theFrench pilots union said the committee didn't go far enough.He criticized the committee for failing to comment on theA-320's navigation system, which has also been viewed as apossible contributor to the crash.   Mr. Maurel also questioned the committee's lack of commenton the placement of the plane's in-flight recorders -- knownas the &quot;black boxes.&quot; Mr. Maurel said the committee shouldexamine how to better position the recorders, one of whichwas destroyed in the crash.   Although the panel's report raises questions about theplane's display system, analysts said they expected it wouldhave little effect on the consortium's sales. Analysts notedthat the market for the 150-seat A-320 is saturated and fewnew orders are expected for the plane this year.</TEXT></DOC>
