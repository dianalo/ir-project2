The partnership is to be known as Star Enterprise and is expected to be in operation by Dec. 31. According to Texaco, the Saudi participation will provide the company with benefits worth an estimated $1.8 billion. And, for Saudi Arabia, it provides a major stake in oil refining and marketing in the U.S., the world's biggest fuel consumer.    &quot;We will try to get into this type of business all over the world -- in Europe and the Far East,&quot; Mr. Nazer told a news conference. Asked how much of the oil produced by Saudi Arabia, the world's third largest crude-oil producer, eventually might be processed through such ventures, he replied: &quot;Without putting a time span, probably all of it.&quot;    Mr. Nazer called the joint venture with Texaco a big first step in the kingdom's plan to become more actively involved in the refining and marketing segment of the oil industry. Texaco officials here for the signing of the agreement called it a significant development in the company's restructuring program that will produce major cash and other benefits.    The value of the cash benefits previously had been estimated at $2 billion by Texaco. In an interview yesterday, James W. Kinnear, president of Texaco, said the drop in estimated benefits to the company is due entirely to the decline in crude prices since the proposed transaction was announced last June. He said, however, that the terms are the same as previously announced.    The purchase price to Saudi Arabia for the 50% interest in the joint venture is $812 million. In addition, Saudi Refining Inc., which represents the kingdom's interest, will provide 75% of the joint venture's initial oil inventory -- some 30 million barrels. Also, the Saudi firm will contribute a 50% share of the working capital other than oil. By sharing inventory and working capital, Texaco expects to realize some $1.8 billion in cash benefits and savings, subject to prices of crude oil and petroleum products at the time of closing.    The agreement provides for the purchase by Saudi Refining of a 50% interest in Texaco's refining assets and marketing system in 23 eastern and Gulf Coast states and the District of Columbia. These include three Texaco refineries, some 1,400 owned and leased service stations and a network of some 10,000 franchised stations.    Star Enterprise, which will have headquarters in Houston, will use the Texaco trademark for its petroleum products in the 23-state area. Also, it will have the right to purchase 600,000 barrels a day of Saudi Arabia's crude oil at market prices.    Officials of both Saudi Arabia and Texaco noted the kingdom and the company have had an association of more than 50 years in the production of petroleum. And their joint venture represents by far the biggest move yet into refining and marketing by a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The joint venture will rank 10th in total gasoline sales in the U.S.    The document covering the terms of the agreement is more than three inches thick, with pages printed on both sides. Despite its size, development of the joint venture has been speedy. Negotiations between Texaco and the Saudis began only last December. </TEXT></DOC>
