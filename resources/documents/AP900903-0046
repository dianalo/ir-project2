Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The capture of a jail escapee has providedleads in the search for a second escapee and the woman guard whoinvestigators believe is romantically linked to him, authoritiessaid Monday.   James V. Barnes, 35, of Romney, was captured Sunday night in avacant vacation home, said West Virginia State Police Cpl. E.E.Bolyard. He escaped early Wednesday from a jail in Cumberland, Md.,30 miles to the north.   About 15 law enforcement officers surrounded the house and apolice dog and its handler who entered through a window foundBarnes hiding behind a door, said Maj. Gary Simpson of the AlleganyCounty Sheriff's Department in Maryland. Barnes was treated for abite from the police dog.   Barnes waived his right to fight extradition and was being heldin the Hampshire County Jail until he could be taken back toMaryland.   Barnes and Edgar Eugene Kerns Jr., 30, escaped from theirmaximum-security cells at the Allegany County Detention Center inCumberland. Another prison guard watched them take guard Sandra KayBeeman with them, grabbing her neck in a choke hold.   At first authorities regarded Beeman as a hostage although theywondered how the men, armed just with hard objects in white socks,were able to force Beeman to open two sets of locked doors.   Then, on Saturday, the 46-year-old guard telephoned her daughterin Frostburg, Md., to tell her: ``I'm fine. I'm with him.''   A warrant charging Beeman with aiding in the escape, a felonythat carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, was issued later thatday.   The capture of Barnes clears up who Beeman is with, Simpsonsaid. Barnes told authorities Kerns and Beeman were together whenthe trio separated earlier in the week.   Statements by Barnes confirmed police beliefs that Kerns andBeeman are romantically linked, Simpson said. Barnes also providednew leads about where the pair may have headed, Simpson said.   Barnes had been sentenced to 50 years in prison in Virginia forrape, kidnapping and robbery. He entered the Cumberland jail Feb.14 to await trial for rape, kidnapping and assault with a deadlyweapon a knife.   Kerns, of Martinsburg, W.Va., had been in the Cumberland jailsince Jan. 13. He was awaiting sentencing on charges of grandlarceny and writing bad checks. He had been charged with assaultfor allegedly beating his wife, but that case wasn't prosecutedbecause she declined to testify, authorities said.   On the night of the escape, co-workers said, Beeman asked anofficer to pick up dinner from a nearby carryout restaurant,leaving Beeman and another guard on duty. Beeman then went upstairsfor a routine round, carrying keys to all the cells, a breach ofpolicy.   The two men, who had been in maximum security cells, and Beemanwalked downstairs and through a series of doors, including one thatwas supposed to be locked at all times.   The men threatened the other officer, who locked herself in abathroom, co-workers said.   The three then left in Beeman's car.   ``I've known Kay,'' said Allegany Deputy Craig Allen Robertson,the detective in charge of the case. ``She was a friend of mine.But now she's crossed a border. ... It makes it very hard.''</TEXT></DOC>
