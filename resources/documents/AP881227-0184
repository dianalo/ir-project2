KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Vice President GeorgeBush will enter the House of Representatives and announce he hasbeen elected president, 426 to 111, fulfilling a ritual that hasbeen called constitutional Russian roulette.   Bush's declaration to a joint session of Congress will come afterthe counting of the only ballots that really count under theConstitution, those cast by the 538 members of the Electoral College.   Yes, it's true that Bush won 53.4 percent of the popular votes,defeating his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, who captured 45.6percent. It's true he got more than 7 million votes more than hisopponent.   But under the Constitution, the voting in November was only apreliminary round. The voters in fact only elected electors.   The election is over with the counting on Wednesday of ballotscast by the electors on Dec. 20, when they met in their statecapitals.   There was one surprise: West Virginia elector Margaret Leach casther ballot for Lloyd Bentsen for president and Dukakis for vicepresident, reversing the order of the Democratic ticket.   ``I did it for a reason, and the reaseon was to make a statementabout the Electoral College, said Leach, a nurse in Huntington,W.Va. ``It was fine then (when it was established), but we'veoutgrown it.''   No other democracy in the world does it quite this way.   As one might suspect, the process is the result of a compromise,one of the very first compromises in the 200-year history of theUnited States under the Constitution.   In August 1787, the constitutional convention meeting inPhiladelphia found itself unable to agree on a method of selectingthe president.   Direct popular election was opposed by delegates who feared thatmost people would not know enough about the candidates to make awise choice. Other objections were raised to proposals that Congressselect the president or that state legislatures do it.   A committee was appointed and it hammered together a solution.   The solution: Each state would appoint presidential electorsequal to the total number of its senators and representatives inCongress.   In present day terms, that comes to 435 members of the House ofRepresentatives and 100 members of the Senate plus three electoralvotes for the District of Columbia.   On Election Day, the voters of each state actually chooseelectors pledged to the candidate of their choice and selected bystate party organizations.   To win election, a presidential candidate must receive 270electoral votes, an absolute majority.   If no candidate scores that high, the winner is picked by theHouse of Representatives from the three top vote getters. In thatprocess, each state delegation casts just one vote. The elections of1800 and 1824 were decided that way.   If no vice presidential candidate gets a majority, the victor ischosen by the Senate from the top two. The last time that happenedwas in 1836.   Under the original system, the candidate receiving the largestnumber of electoral votes was elected president; the runner upbecame vice president.   In 1800 the electors made a mistake. They gave equal numbers ofvotes to Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, a result that forced thecontest into the House where it took 36 ballots to settle the issuein Jefferson's favor.   The 12th amendment to the Constitution, enacted four year later,provided for separate votes for president and vice president, endingthe possibility of a repeat performance.   Electoral ballots are first counted and certified in each statecapitol.   The certificates are opened in the House of Representives by thevice president, acting in his constitutional role as president ofthe Senate.   Four tellers, two from the House, two from the Senate, count thevotes of each state's electors, then hand the tally to the vicepresident who announces them in alphabetical order.   In theory, it is quite possible for someone other than Bush orVice President-elect Dan Quayle to be the winner.   It won't happen. But it could.   So-called ``faithless electors'' have voted from time to time forcandidates other than those to which they were pledged, as WestVirginia's Leach did this time around.   The League of Women voters points out that faithless electorscould cause a candidate who had won the popular vote to wind up oneor two votes short in the Electoral College.   And in a close election, perhaps one in which the votes are splitby a third party, it is possible that the candidate with the largestpopular vote might lose in the Electoral College. This could happenbecause of the winner-take-all rule in which the candidate who winsmost of the votes in a state gets all of that state's electoralvotes.   Over the years, atttempts have been made to shut down theElectoral College, replacing it, perhaps, with a system of directelection.   In 1968, the late Rep. Hale Boggs, D-La., said there was ``acrying need to amend the Constitution and once and for all get ridof this anachronistic system which every four years puts us in theposition of playing Russian roulette with the election of thepresident of the United States.''   One proposal would eliminate the winner-take-all aspects of theElectoral College by awarding electoral votes by congressionaldistricts with only two electors chosen on a statewide basis.   Former Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., fought a long but ultimatelyunsuccessful battle to enact a constitutional amendment providingfor the direct election of the president and vice president byabolishing the electoral system.   Under that proposal, the pair of candidates with the most voteswould be elected if they received at least 40 percent of the ballotsnationwide. A runoff election would be required if no slate received40 percent.   The runoff provision was the focus of most objections and theSenate defeated the proposed amendment in 1979.   There are those who think it would be a mistake to scrap theElectoral College.   That argument was made in the 1971 book ``The Case Against DirectElection of the President, A Defense of the Electoral College,'' byJudith Best.   Acknowledging the present system is not perfect, she said it mayhave a silver lining.   ``The prospect of a runner-up presidency, the prospect of winningthe popular but not the electoral vote, spurs (the) parties to seekthe support of broad cross sections of the nation,'' she wrote.``The risk of a runner-up presidency may not be too great a price topay for a system which minimizes conflicts, promises stability,suppresses factions, promotes moderation and requires a broad baseof support.''   As a whole, she said, the Electoral College system has succeeded,never failing to fill the office of the president.   ``Like all living things it has imperfections and defects, but itfunctions, indeed it thrives,'' she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AM Mon Jan 2</NOTE></DOC>
